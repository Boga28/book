CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,439
Jean Valjean

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:15,650
One evening in October 1815, an hour before
sunset, a man with a long beard and dusty,

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,170
torn clothes walked into the town of Digne.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,090
He was in his late forties, of medium height,
broad-shouldered and strong.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:31,880
A leather cap half-hid his face, which was
sunburnt and shining with sweat.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,489
His rough yellow shirt was unbuttoned, revealing
a hairy chest.

8
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:45,449
On his back was a heavy soldier's bag, and
in his hand was a large wooden stick.

9
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:51,129
The townspeople, who had never seen him before,
watched with interest as he stopped for water

10
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:52,980
at a fountain.

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,590
Children followed him to the marketplace,
where he stopped for more water at another

12
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,090
fountain.

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,510
He then crossed the square towards an inn,
and entered by the kitchen door.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,470
The innkeeper, who was also the cook, was
busy with his pots and pans, preparing a meal

15
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:16,370
for a group of travellers who were laughing
and joking in the next room.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,640
'What can I do for you, Monsieur?' he asked
without looking up.

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,520
'A meal and a bed,' said the stranger.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,420
'Of course.'

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,119
The innkeeper turned to look at him.

20
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,830
Then, seeing the visitors rough appearance,
he added, 'If you can pay for it.'

21
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,399
'I have money.'

22
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,810
The stranger produced an old leather purse
from his jacket.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,659
'Then you're welcome,' the innkeeper said.

24
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,659
The stranger smiled with relief and sat down
by the fire.

25
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,970
He did not see a young boy run out with a
note that the innkeeper had quickly written.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:06,310
He did not see the boy return a short time
later and whisper something to the innkeeper.

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,340
'When will the meal be ready?'

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,879
the stranger asked.

29
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,720
'I'm sorry, Monsieur,' the innkeeper said.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,019
'You can't stay here.

31
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,340
I've got no free rooms.'

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,400
'Then put me in a stable.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,349
All I need is a quiet corner somewhere.

34
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,730
After dinner

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,660
'You can't eat here either,' the innkeeper
interrupted.

36
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,230
'I haven't enough food.'

37
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,770
'What about all that food in the pots?'

38
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,290
The innkeeper approached and, bending towards
the man, said in a fierce whisper, 'Get out.

39
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,430
I know who you are.

40
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,489
Your name is Jean Valjean.

41
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,200
You've just been released from prison.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,870
I can't serve people like you here.'

43
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,580
The man rose without another word, picked
up his bag and stick, and left.

44
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,540
Outside, it was growing dark and a cold wind
was blowing from the mountains in the east.

45
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,340
The man looked around, desperate for somewhere
to spend the night.

46
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,590
He tried another inn, but the same thing happened.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,580
He knocked on the doors of people's houses,
but news of his arrival had quickly spread

48
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,730
and nobody would offer him shelter from the
cold.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,110
He even tried sleeping in a garden, but was
chased away by a dog.

50
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,480
Finally, he found himself in the cathedral
square.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,370
He shook his fist at the church and then,
cold and hungry, he lay down on a stone bench

52
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,510
by the doorway.

53
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,120
A few minutes later, an old woman came out
of the cathedral and saw him lying there.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,810
'What are you doing?' she asked.

55
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,709
He answered angrily, 'Can't you see?

56
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm trying to sleep.'

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,400
'On this bench, in this cold wind?'

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,340
'I've slept for nineteen years on a piece
of wood.

59
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Now it's stone.

60
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
What's the difference?'

61
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,470
'Why don't you go to an inn?'

62
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,040
'Because I haven't any money,' he lied.

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,610
The old woman opened her purse and gave him
a few coins.

64
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,160
Then she said, 'Have you tried everywhere?'

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,590
'I've knocked at every door.'

66
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,170
'What about that one over there?'

67
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:50,120
she said, pointing across the square to a
small house beside the bishop's palace.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
***

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,490
The Bishop of Digne was a kind old man who,
many years earlier, had given his palace to

70
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,620
the town hospital.

71
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:08,120
He lived a simple life with his sister, Mademoiselle
Baptistine, and his old servant, Madame Magloire,

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,310
and he was much loved by the people in the
town.

73
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,480
He trusted everyone.

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,690
His doors were never locked, so that anybody
who needed his help could find him easily.

75
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:29,150
That evening, Mme Magloire was chatting with
Mile Baptistine before serving the meal.

76
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,320
'People say there's a stranger in town,' she
said.

77
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,770
'The police say that he looks dangerous, and
it would be better for everyone to lock their

78
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,080
windows and doors.'

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,289
'Brother.'

80
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,810
Mile Baptistine turned to the bishop, who
was sitting by the fire.

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,080
'Did you hear what Mme Magloire was saying?'

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,550
'Something about a dangerous stranger walking
the streets?' he asked with an amused smile.

83
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,479
'This is no joke,' Mme Magloire said.

84
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,160
'The man is in rags and has an evil look on
his face.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Everybody in the town agrees that something
terrible will happen tonight.

86
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,020
And your sister agrees with me that this house
isn't safe.

87
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,940
If you like, I can make arrangements now to
get a lock put on the door

88
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,410
Before the bishop could reply, there was a
heavy knock on the door.

89
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,920
'Come in,' said the bishop.

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,169
The door opened and Jean Valjean, the stranger,
walked in.

91
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:43,199
Mme Magloire trembled, open-mouthed with fear,
while Mile Baptistine rose from her seat with

92
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,039
alarm.

93
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,150
The bishop, however, looked calmly at his
unexpected visitor.

94
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:57,590
'My name is Jean Valjean,' the stranger said
before anybody could speak.

95
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,000
'I've been in prison for nineteen years.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,860
They let me out four days ago.

97
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:11,889
I've been walking all day, and nobody in this
town will give me food or a bed for the night.

98
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,729
A woman saw me lying on a stone bench across
the square and suggested that I come here.

99
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,020
So here I am.

100
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,949
What is this place?

101
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,250
Is it an inn?

102
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,840
I've got money.

103
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,740
Will you let me stay?'

104
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,080
'Mme Magloire,' said the bishop, 'will you
please prepare another place at the table

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
for this gentleman?'

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,030
Valjean took a step forward.

107
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,760
'No, you don't understand,' he said.

108
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,250
'I've spent five years in prison for violent
robbery, another fourteen years for trying

109
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,250
to escape four times.

110
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,520
I'm a dangerous man.'

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:04,650
'Mme Magloire,' the bishop went on, 'you must
put clean sheets on the bed in the spare room.'

112
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,440
Mme Magloire, an obedient servant, left the
room without protest.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,460
The bishop turned to the man.

114
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,629
'Sit down and warm yourself, Monsieur.

115
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,830
Supper will soon be ready.'

116
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,770
Jean Valjean's face, which had been hard and
fierce, suddenly softened.

117
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:33,060
'You really mean it?' he asked, his voice
trembling with childish excitement.

118
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,560
'You'll let me stay?

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,060
I'm a dangerous criminal, but you called me
"Monsieur".

120
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,680
I don't believe it.

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,649
May I ask your name, sir?

122
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,560
Are you an innkeeper?'

123
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,790
'I'm a priest,' said the bishop.

124
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,270
'And this is where I live.'

125
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,420
'A priest?'

126
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,670
Valjean said, sitting by the fire.

127
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,950
'So I don't have to pay?'

128
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,340
'You can keep your money,' the bishop replied.

129
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,079
During dinner, Mile Baptistine looked at Valjean
kindly while the bishop talked about the local

130
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,240
cheese-making industry.

131
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,980
Valjean was so hungry that, at first, he paid
no attention to anyone.

132
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,140
Soon, however, he began to relax, and looked
around the room.

133
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,670
'This is not the house of a rich man,' he
thought.

134
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,830
'And the travellers in the inn eat better
than this.'

135
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,620
But then he looked at the table, and saw the
beautiful silver candlesticks, knives and

136
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,800
forks.

137
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,460
After dinner, the bishop said goodnight to
his sister, picked up one of the two candlesticks

138
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,490
and, handing the other to his guest, said,
'I'll show you to your room, Monsieur.'

139
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,970
Valjean followed the bishop upstairs into
a bedroom.

140
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,240
This was the bishop's bedroom.

141
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,820
As he was following the bishop across the
room, however, he noticed Mme Magloire putting

142
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,580
the silver knives and forks in a cupboard
by the bed.

143
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,570
The bishop showed his guest into the spare
room.

144
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,209
'Sleep well,' he said.

145
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:29,670
'Before you leave tomorrow, you must have
a bowl of warm milk from our cows.'

146
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,690
Valjean was so tired that he fell asleep,
fully-dressed, on top of the sheets, but he

147
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,620
didn't sleep for long.

148
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:47,010
When he woke up, the cathedral clock was striking
two, but he had not woken because of this.

149
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,540
He had woken because the bed was too comfortable;
he had not slept in a proper bed for twenty

150
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,149
years.

151
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:03,700
Unable to return to sleep, he gazed into the
darkness, thinking about the past twenty years.

152
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,589
Life had been unjust to him, and he was angry.

153
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:13,589
In 1795, he had lost his job as a tree-cutter.

154
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:20,790
At that time he was looking after his sister,
whose husband had died, and her seven children.

155
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:26,490
Out of work, and with no food in the house,
he had been arrested for trying to steal a

156
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,270
loaf of bread.

157
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:36,370
Now, at last, he was free, but he felt bitter
and angry about his lost years.

158
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,670
The world had been unfair to him, and he wanted
revenge.

159
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,840
Then, remembering the silver on the bishop's
table, he had an idea.

160
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,560
He sat up, swung his feet to the floor and
slowly stood up.

161
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,890
The house was silent.

162
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,870
He moved carefully towards the window and
looked out.

163
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:07,540
The night was not very dark; there was a full
moon, hidden from time to time by large clouds

164
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,330
moving quickly across the sky.

165
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,150
After studying the garden, he decided that
escape would be easy.

166
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:25,019
He turned back to the room, picked up his
bag and took out a short iron bar, sharpened

167
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,880
at one end.

168
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,580
He then put his shoes into the bag and, grasping
the iron bar in his right hand, he moved quietly

169
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,310
towards the door of the bishop's bedroom.

170
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,180
It was half-open.

171
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,680
The bishop had not closed it.

172
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,630
Valjean stood listening.

173
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,000
There was no sound.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,320
He gave the door a gentle push and crept into
the bedroom.

175
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,930
Just as he reached the side of the bishop's
bed, the moon came out from behind a cloud

176
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,920
and filled the room with light.

177
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:11,310
Valjean gazed down at the bishop's gentle,
sleeping face, and felt a kind of terror.

178
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,620
He had never before seen such peace, such
kindness, such trust.

179
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,480
He suddenly turned away and moved quickly
to the cupboard.

180
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,459
The first thing he saw when he opened the
door was the basket of silver.

181
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:35,329
He grabbed it, hurried back to the spare bedroom,
picked up his stick and bag, climbed out of

182
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:43,260
the window, emptied the silver into his bag
and threw the basket into the garden.

183
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:50,329
A minute later he climbed the garden wall
and disappeared into the trees.

184
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:58,509
Early the next morning, while the bishop was
studying the flowers in his garden, Mme Magloire

185
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,670
ran out of the house with a look of alarm
on her face.

186
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,480
'Monseigneur, do you know where the silver-basket
is?'

187
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,840
'Yes,' said the bishop.

188
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,380
'I found it in one of the flowerbeds.'

189
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,930
'But it's empty!'

190
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,930
she cried.

191
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,060
'Where's the silver?'

192
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,139
'Oh, you're worried about the silver?

193
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:23,130
I don't know where that is.'

194
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,860
'Heaven save us, it's been stolen!'

195
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
she cried.

196
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,709
'The man who came last night!

197
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,230
He's run off with our silver!'

198
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,389
The bishop, who had been bending sadly over
a plant damaged by the basket, looked up and

199
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:44,500
said gently, 'I think I was wrong to keep
the silver for so long.

200
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,860
It really belongs to the poor.

201
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,680
I should have given it away a long time ago.'

202
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,089
Later that morning, as the bishop and his
sister were having breakfast, there was a

203
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,519
knock on the door.

204
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,370
Four men walked into the room.

205
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,250
Three of them were policemen; the fourth was
Jean Valjean.

206
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,320
'Monseigneur... ' the sergeant in charge of
the group began.

207
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,630
Valjean raised his head with surprise.

208
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,230
'Monseigneur?'

209
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,420
he repeated.

210
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,040
'I thought he was a priest.'

211
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,399
'Silence,' said one of the policemen, 'This
is the Bishop of Digne.'

212
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,930
The bishop, meanwhile, had moved towards the
group of men and was smiling at Jean Valjean.

213
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,190
'I'm delighted to see you again, dear friend,'
he said.

214
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,290
'But what about the candlesticks?

215
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,290
I gave you those as well, don't you remember?

216
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,959
They're silver like the rest, and worth at
least two hundred francs.

217
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,240
Did you forget to take them?'

218
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,649
Jean Valjean's eyes widened with disbelief.

219
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:06,069
'Monseigneur,' said the sergeant, 'do I understand
that this man was telling the truth?

220
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,819
We found this silver in his bag, and

221
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:15,430
'And he told you,' the bishop finished the
sentence for him, 'that an old priest had

222
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,060
given it to him?

223
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,259
Yes, he was telling the truth.'

224
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,360
'So this man isn't a thief?

225
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,760
'The sergeant looked as surprised as Valjean.

226
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,260
'Not at all.

227
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,290
So you can let him go at once.'

228
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,589
The policemen let go of Valjean's arms.

229
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:42,300
He moved his feet nervously, uncertain of
what to say at first.

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,760
Then he murmured, 'Am I really free to go?'

231
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,620
'Of course,' said the bishop.

232
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,199
'But this time, you mustn't forget your candlesticks.'

233
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,240
He fetched them from a shelf and gave them
to Valjean.

234
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,120
'Now, go in peace,' he said softly.

235
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,520
The policemen left, but Valjean did not move.

236
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,410
He did not know what to think.

237
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:20,000
The bishop walked up to him and said in a
low voice, 'Don't forget that you've promised

238
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,350
to use the money to make yourself an honest
man.'

239
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:30,530
Valjean, who did not remember having made
such a promise, was silent.

240
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:40,299
'Jean Valjean,' the bishop continued, 'I've
bought your soul from the Devil, and have

241
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,230
given it to God.'

242
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,230
***

243
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,820
Jean Valjean left the town and ran into the
countryside, blindly following lanes and paths,

244
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,190
not realizing that he was running in circles.

245
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,630
He was filled with a strange kind of anger,
but he did not know why.

246
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,850
Finally, as evening fell, he sat on the ground,
exhausted, and gazed across the fields at

247
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,429
the distant mountains, wishing that he was
back in prison.

248
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:17,270
When he had been angry at the world, he had
felt calm and sure of himself.

249
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:23,470
But now, for the first time in twenty years,
a man had shown him great kindness, and he

250
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,100
did not know what to feel.

251
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,330
Suddenly, he heard the sound of singing.

252
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:36,400
A boy of about ten years old was coming along
a footpath with a small box on his back and

253
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,290
dirty knees showing through holes in his trousers.

254
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:47,260
As he sang, he threw a coin into the air and
caught it before it fell.

255
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,020
Not noticing Jean Valjean sitting by the side
of the path, he threw the coin higher into

256
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,040
the air.

257
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,630
This time, however, he did not catch it and
it rolled along the ground towards Valjean,

258
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,150
who immediately put his foot on it.

259
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,940
The boy, unafraid, walked up to Valjean.

260
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,100
'Please, Monsieur, may I have my coin?'

261
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,299
'What's your name?' asked Valjean.

262
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:20,990
'Petit-Gervais,' said the boy, smiling trustfully.

263
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,120
'I'm a chimney sweep, and that money is all
I have.'

264
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,710
'Go away,' said Valjean.

265
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,270
'Please, Monsieur, that's my money.'

266
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,280
Valjean lowered his head and did not reply.

267
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,140
'My money!'

268
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,390
the boy cried.

269
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,710
'My piece of silver!

270
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,390
My coin!'

271
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,040
Valjean seemed not to hear him.

272
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,610
The boy seized his collar and shook him.

273
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,220
'I want my money!' he cried.

274
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:01,080
Valjean slowly raised his head and stared
with a sort of amazement at the child.

275
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,160
Then, reaching for his stick, he said, 'Go
to Hell!'

276
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:17,070
The boy, suddenly afraid of the mad, fierce
look in Valjean's eyes, turned and ran.

277
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,110
Valjean stood for some time gazing emptily
around him at the sunset and the shadows moving

278
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,260
in on him.

279
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,070
Suddenly he shivered, as if he had become
aware for the first time of the icy wind.

280
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:37,880
He bent down to pick up his bag but, as he
did so, he caught sight of the silver coin,

281
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,200
half-buried by his foot in the earth.

282
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,559
It affected him like an electric shock.

283
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,750
'What's that?' he murmured.

284
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:54,620
He stared at the coin with a look of puzzlement,
as if he were trying to remember something.

285
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,590
Then, with a sudden movement, he bent down
and picked it up.

286
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,610
He looked around but could see nothing in
the darkness - just a purple mist rising slowly

287
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,420
from the fields.

288
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,840
He called the boy's name, but there was no
reply.

289
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,809
Within minutes he was running along the path,
shouting.

290
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:19,809
'Petit-Gervais!

291
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:20,809
Petit-Gervais!'

292
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,590
There was still no reply.

293
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,860
A short time later, he met a priest on horseback.

294
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,210
'Have you seen a boy go by?' he asked.

295
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,830
The priest shook his head.

296
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,830
'No.

297
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,430
Why do you ask?'

298
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,600
Valjean produced two five-franc pieces and
gave them to the priest.

299
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
'This is for your poor, Monsieur.

300
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,920
He was a boy of about ten, a chimney sweep.

301
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,799
Monsieur, you must report me to the police.

302
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:52,799
I'm a thief.

303
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,390
I stole money from him.

304
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,130
Here, let me give you more money

305
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:06,650
But before Valjean could produce more coins,
the priest rode away in terror.

306
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,470
Valjean looked for the boy for another hour,
running along the path, calling out his name,

307
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,169
but with no success.

308
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:19,380
Finally he stopped and sat, exhausted, on
a rock.

309
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,490
Then, his heart full of grief for what he
had done, he buried his face in his hands

310
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,799
and, for the first time in nineteen years,
he cried.

311
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,340
CHAPTER TWO

312
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,500
Fantine

313
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:44,160
On a spring evening in 1818, in the village
of Montfermeil, not far from Paris, two little

314
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,920
girls were playing on a swing outside a small
inn.

315
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,970
Their mother - a big, red-haired woman with
a plain face - sat on the doorstep of the

316
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,490
inn, watching them.

317
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:03,290
'You have two very pretty children, Madame,'
a voice said from close beside her.

318
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,470
The woman looked round and saw a young woman
with a child sleeping peacefully in her arms.

319
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:15,020
The mother was young and pretty, but she looked
poor and unhappy.

320
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,720
She did not smile, and lines of sadness ran
down the side of her pale cheeks.

321
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,740
Her clothes were old and dirty, and she wore
a tight, plain cap over her beautiful blonde

322
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,860
hair.

323
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,620
'Thank you,' said the woman.

324
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,860
'Why don't you sit down for a minute?

325
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,890
You look tired.

326
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:43,340
'When the young woman had sat down next to
her, the red-haired woman introduced herself.

327
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,860
'My name's Thenardier.

328
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,120
My husband and I manage this inn.'

329
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,890
'My names Fantine,' the young woman said.

330
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:02,770
'I used to work in Paris, but my husband died
and I lost my job.'

331
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:08,770
She could not tell Mme Thenardier the truth,
which was that she had been made pregnant

332
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,390
by a young man who had then abandoned her.

333
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,679
'I left Paris this morning to look for work
in Montreuil,' she continued.

334
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,159
'My little girl walked some of the way, but
she's very small.

335
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,730
I had to carry her and she's fallen asleep.'

336
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,789
As she spoke these words, she gave her daughter
a loving kiss, which woke her up.

337
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,130
The child's eyes were as wide and blue as
her mother's.

338
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,919
With a little laugh, she jumped off her mother's
lap and ran to play with the two girls on

339
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,390
the swing.

340
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,669
'What's your little girl's name?'

341
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:52,470
Mme Thenardier asked.

342
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,000
'Euphrasie - but I call her Cosette.

343
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
She's nearly three.'

344
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,039
The two women watched the children playing
together.

345
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,799
'Children make friends very easily, don't
they?'

346
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,730
Mme Thenardier smiled.

347
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,020
'Look at them.

348
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,610
They could easily be sisters.'

349
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,529
At these words, Fantine did a very strange
thing.

350
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:26,100
She took Mme Thenardiers hand and said, 'Will
you look after my daughter for me?'

351
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,770
Mme Thenardier looked at Fantine thoughtfully,
but said nothing.

352
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,890
'I can't take her with me,' Fantine continued.

353
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,220
'I have to find work, and that's not easy
with a child but no husband.

354
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,990
As soon as I find a job, I'll come and fetch
her.

355
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,090
Will you do that for me?

356
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,870
I could pay six francs a month.'

357
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:58,900
Mme Thenardier still said nothing, but a man's
voice from inside the house called, 'We'll

358
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,840
take seven francs a month, and six months
in advance.'

359
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,860
Fantine agreed.

360
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,060
'And another fifteen francs for extras,' called
the man.

361
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:17,530
'You will have them,' said Fantine, assuming
that she was talking to Mme Thenardiers husband.

362
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,820
'I have eighty francs.'

363
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,250
'Does the child have enough clothes?'

364
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,260
the man asked.

365
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,350
'She has some beautiful clothes,' Fantine
replied.

366
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,020
'Plenty of everything and silk dresses like
a lady.

367
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,429
They're all in my bag.'

368
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:37,840
The man's face finally appeared in the doorway.

369
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,990
'Then we agree to look after her for you,'
he said.

370
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:50,559
The next morning, Fantine kissed her daughter
goodbye and left for Montreuil, crying as

371
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,390
if her heart would break.

372
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,600
'This money will be useful,'Thenardier said
to his wife.

373
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,220
'Now I can pay off all my debts and stay out
of prison.

374
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm proud of you.

375
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,260
You set a very clever trap.'

376
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:13,029
'Without even intending to,' his wife replied.

377
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:20,260
One month later, Thenardier was short of money
again, so he took Cosette's beautiful silk

378
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,080
clothes to Paris and sold them for sixty francs.

379
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,409
The couple dressed Cosette in rags and gave
her very little food, which they made her

380
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,710
eat from a wooden bowl under the table.

381
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,010
The dog and the cat, who ate with her, were
her only companions.

382
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:46,760
Fantine, meanwhile, found work in Montreuil
and asked for news of her daughter every month.

383
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,929
The Thenardiers always replied that she was
in good health and very happy.

384
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:59,080
At the end of the year, however, Thenardier
was not happy with just seven francs a month;

385
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,059
he demanded twelve and Fantine paid without
protest, happy that her daughter was being

386
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,740
well cared for.

387
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:15,320
The Thenardiers, who were loving and gentle
to their own daughters, Eponine and Azelma,

388
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,419
treated Cosette like a slave.

389
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,980
They made her get up before dawn every day
and do all the dirty jobs around the house,

390
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,190
while Eponine and Azelma wore pretty clothes
and played with dolls.

391
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:38,190
By the age of five, Cosette had become a thin,
pale-faced, silent child.

392
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,799
Misery had made her ugly and only her beautiful
blue eyes remained.

393
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,080
The Thenardiers did not feel guilty about
treating Cosette badly because Fantine had

394
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,830
stopped sending them regular payments.

395
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:58,710
'The child is lucky to have a home at all,'
they told everybody.

396
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:03,190
'Without us, she'd be living on the streets.'

397
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,190
***

398
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,559
When Fantine first arrived in Montreuil, she
had immediately found work in a factory.

399
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:17,720
She rented a small room, sent money regularly
to the Thenardiers and, for a short time,

400
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,700
was almost happy.

401
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:26,820
She forgot many of her problems, and dreamt
only of Cosette and her plans for the future.

402
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,950
But her happiness did not last long.

403
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,630
Although she was careful to say nothing about
her daughter to anyone, other women at the

404
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,470
factory soon discovered her secret.

405
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:45,760
An unmarried woman with a child was a terrible
thing in those days, and Fantine lost her

406
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
job.

407
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,240
She tried to find work as a servant, but no
one would employ her.

408
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,669
She finally managed to earn a little money
sewing shirts, but she was unable to send

409
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:01,710
money regularly to the Thenardiers.

410
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:09,850
That winter, Fantine saved money by not having
a fire, and developed a small, dry cough.

411
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,790
By the following winter, her debts had increased.

412
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,760
The Thenardiers wrote her a frightening letter
in which they told her that Cosette had no

413
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,110
clothes, and that they needed ten francs immediately
to buy her a new dress.

414
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:29,690
Fantine, who did not have ten francs, but
who was afraid that her daughter would freeze

415
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,450
to death, went to the barber's shop.

416
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:39,159
She took out her comb and let her blonde hair
fall down to her waist.

417
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,690
'Such beautiful hair!'

418
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,990
the barber said.

419
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,160
'How much will you give me for it?'

420
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,000
Fantine asked.

421
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,840
'Ten francs.'

422
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,500
'Then cut it off.'

423
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,760
After selling her hair to the barber, Fantine
was able to buy a woollen dress, which she

424
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,510
sent to the Thenardiers.

425
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,299
The Thenardiers, however, were very angry
- they had wanted money, not clothes.

426
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:13,060
They gave the dress to their daughter, Eponine,
and Cosette went on shivering.

427
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:20,080
A few weeks later, Fantine received another
letter from the Thenardiers.

428
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,740
This time they wanted forty francs because
Cosette was very ill and urgently needed medicine.

429
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:34,070
Fantine felt desperate; she did not know how
to obtain such a large sum of money.

430
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:39,440
As she was wandering around the town, desperately
trying to decide what to do, she noticed a

431
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,930
crowd of people in the market square.

432
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:47,590
She approached them without thinking, and
discovered that they had gathered around a

433
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,419
travelling dentist.

434
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:55,350
Forgetting her troubles for a moment, she
smiled at the dentist's humorous efforts to

435
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,799
sell the people of Montreuil false teeth.

436
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,600
Suddenly the dentist saw her.

437
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,890
'You've got lovely teeth,' he said.

438
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:12,570
'If you sold me your two front teeth, I'd
pay you forty francs.'

439
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,600
Fantine ran home, upset and disgusted.

440
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:25,399
'My hair will grow again,' she thought, 'but
teeth would be gone forever.'

441
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:32,130
But then she thought about her daughter, and
her own appearance suddenly seemed unimportant.

442
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,520
That evening, she visited the dentist at the
inn where he was staying, and allowed him

443
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,840
to remove her teeth.

444
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,550
Fantine could not sleep that night.

445
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:49,980
She sat on her bed, cold and shivering, and
looked at the two coins shining on the table.

446
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,950
Then she gave a blood-stained smile.

447
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,730
'I'm happy,' she told herself.

448
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,100
'My baby isn't going to die.'

449
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:08,649
Fantine earned less and less money from her
sewing, and the Thenardiers demanded more

450
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,760
and more money to look after Cosette.

451
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,830
Fantine spent whole nights crying.

452
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,540
What could she do?

453
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,940
She had sold her hair and her teeth; what
else could she sell?

454
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:30,220
And then she decided that she had no other
choice: she would have to sell herself.

455
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,039
She became a prostitute.

456
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,980
CHAPTER THREE

457
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,899
Monsieur Madeleine

458
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:47,940
One winter's evening, a toothless woman with
a grey face and flowers in her hair was arrested

459
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,149
for attacking a man in the street.

460
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:57,351
She was taken to the police station, where
Inspector Javert, the chief of police, sent

461
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,360
her to prison for six months.

462
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
'Please, M. Javert.'

463
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,580
The woman fell to her knees.

464
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,730
'I owe a hundred francs.

465
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,060
If I don't pay, my little girl will lose her
home and be thrown out on to the streets.

466
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,510
Please don't send me to prison.'

467
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:22,690
Javert listened to her coldly, then ordered
a policeman to take her away.

468
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,810
While the policeman was trying to drag her
to her feet, however, a voice from the shadows

469
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,970
said, 'One moment please.'

470
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:39,290
Javert looked up and saw Monsieur Madeleine,
one of the most important people in the town.

471
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:47,330
M. Madeleine had arrived mysteriously in Montreuil
one December evening in 1815.

472
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:54,829
He had no money but he had a revolutionary
idea: he knew a cheap and efficient method

473
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,290
of manufacturing glass.

474
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:03,570
Within a few months of his arrival, thanks
to his new idea, the glass-making factory

475
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,930
in Montreuil was making enormous profits.

476
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:13,220
With the money he made, M. Madeleine built
two new factories, which provided the town

477
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,810
with hundreds of new jobs.

478
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:22,440
He became a very wealthy man but lived a simple
life, using most of his money to build new

479
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,119
hospitals and schools.

480
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:34,080
He was so popular that, in 1820, the townspeople
elected him mayor of Montreuil.

481
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,940
There was one man, however, who did not like
M. Madeleine.

482
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,869
This was the chief of police, Inspector Javert.

483
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:50,079
He had always been suspicious of M. Madeleine,
and was sure that he had seen him somewhere

484
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,020
before, many years earlier.

485
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,910
But he kept his suspicions to himself, not
daring to say what he really believed: that

486
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:06,410
M. Madeleine was, in fact, a dangerous criminal
with a terrible past.

487
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:14,020
Now, years later, M. Madeleine was in the
police station, trying to save Fantine from

488
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
prison.

489
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,780
Fantine, however, was not grateful.

490
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,859
In fact, when she saw who it was, she spat
at him.

491
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:26,540
'You own the factory where I used to work!'

492
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,710
she shouted at him.

493
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,410
'I lost my job because of you.

494
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:36,300
Now I've become a bad woman, but what choice
did I have?

495
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,829
I'll never get my daughter back if I don't
make money.'

496
00:36:40,829 --> 00:36:48,560
The mayor turned to Inspector Javert and said,
in a soft, firm voice, 'This woman must be

497
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
released.'

498
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,730
'That's impossible,' Javert replied.

499
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,970
'She attacked a man in the street, a respectable
citizen.

500
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,490
And now I've just seen her spit at you, the
mayor of our town.

501
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,160
A woman like this deserves to be punished.'

502
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,550
'But I saw what happened in the street just
now,' M. Madeleine said.

503
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:14,480
'It was the man's fault, not this woman's.

504
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,470
You should arrest him, not her.'

505
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:24,450
Javert argued with M. Madeleine for some time,
but finally gave in.

506
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,960
He walked angrily out of the room, leaving
the mayor and the prostitute alone together.

507
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,170
Fantine trembled, as confused as Javert had
been.

508
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:42,770
The man who had just saved her from prison
was also the man who had caused all her troubles.

509
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:49,320
The devil had suddenly decided to be kind,
and she did not know what to think.

510
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,329
'I heard what you said,' M. Madeleine said
to her.

511
00:37:54,329 --> 00:38:01,370
'I honestly didn't know that you had lost
your job, but I'll try to help you now.

512
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,440
I'll pay your debts and arrange for your child
to return to you.

513
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,510
I'll give you all the money you need.

514
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,450
I'll make you happy again.

515
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:18,480
And I promise that, in the eyes of God, you
have never been a bad woman.'

516
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,990
Fantine gazed at M. Madeleine with tears in
her eyes.

517
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:28,960
After all her pain and suffering she had,
for the first time in her life, found kindness

518
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,480
in another human being.

519
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,340
At last she would be cared for, and she could
look forward to a life of happiness with Cosette.

520
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,720
Without a word, she fell to her knees and
kissed the back of M. Madeleine's hand.

521
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,960
M. Madeleine sent the Thenardiers 300 francs
and told them to send Cosette to Montreuil

522
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,700
immediately.

523
00:38:52,700 --> 00:39:01,180
Thenardier, thinking that Fantine had suddenly
become rich, wrote back and demanded 500 francs.

524
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:07,380
M. Madeleine sent the money, but the Thenardiers
found even more dishonest excuses for not

525
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,650
sending Cosette back.

526
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,650
***

527
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,579
The weeks passed and, although she was happier
than she had been for a long time, Fantine

528
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,349
caught a fever.

529
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:26,150
Months of poverty and misery had made her
ill, and she soon became so weak that she

530
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,210
was unable to leave her bed.

531
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,920
'When shall I see Cosette?'

532
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,180
she kept asking M. Madeleine when he visited
her.

533
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:42,760
'Very soon,' he would reply, and her pale
face would light up with joy.

534
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,579
One morning, as M. Madeleine was making preparations
to leave for Montfermeil and to fetch Cosette

535
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:52,180
himself, he had a visitor.

536
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,280
Inspector Javert walked into his office, and
stood in silence waiting for him to look up

537
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,940
from his work.

538
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,960
'Well, Javert, what is it?'

539
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,480
M. Madeleine finally said.

540
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,640
'I've come to apologize, M. Madeleine,' the
inspector replied.

541
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,190
'What are you talking about?'

542
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,560
'I've treated you unjustly.

543
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,050
I was angry with you six weeks ago when you
told me to release that woman.

544
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:29,410
I wrote to the police headquarters in Paris
and told them about you.'

545
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,730
'Told them what about me?'

546
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:41,100
'Forgive me, M. Madeleine, but I believed
you were a man called Jean Valjean.

547
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,680
He was a prisoner I saw twenty years ago,
when I worked at a prison in Toulon.

548
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,520
After being released from prison, this Valjean
stole some silver from the Bishop of Digne

549
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,079
and robbed a small boy on a public footpath.

550
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,120
We tried to catch him, but he disappeared.

551
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:06,340
When you arrived in Montreuil, I felt sure
that you were this man, but now I know I was

552
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,180
wrong, and I'm sorry.

553
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,380
You will, of course, dismiss me from my job,
as I've shown that I don't deserve your trust.'

554
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:24,480
M. Madeleine, looking hard at Javert without
expression, said quietly, 'I'm afraid I don't

555
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,619
understand.'

556
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,030
'The police headquarters in Paris told me
that Jean Valjean was arrested last autumn

557
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,680
for stealing apples,' Javert explained.

558
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,170
He'd changed his name to Champmathieu and
had lived for several years in the village

559
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,760
of Ailly-le-Haut-Cloche.

560
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,730
Two ex-prisoners from Toulon recognized him
as Jean Valjean.

561
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:51,950
I visited the man in Arras prison, and I saw
for myself that he is indeed Jean Valjean.

562
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,180
Of course, he denies everything, but that's
not surprising.

563
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,230
If he's found guilty of stealing from the
bishop - who, as you know, died a couple of

564
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,790
years ago - and of robbing the small boy,
he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.'

565
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,630
M. Madeleine looked down at his papers.

566
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,030
'This matter is of no interest to me, Javert,'
he said casually.

567
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,470
'I'm sure you have other work to do.'

568
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,900
'I was going to the man's trial in Arras tomorrow,
'Javert said.

569
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,330
'But after this conversation, you must dismiss
me.'

570
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,190
M. Madeleine rose to his feet.

571
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:37,000
'Javert,' he said, 'you're an honourable man.

572
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,180
You made one small mistake, that's all.

573
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,720
I want you to continue your excellent work
as inspector of police.'

574
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,010
He offered Javert his hand, but the inspector
refused to take it.

575
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:56,369
Instead, he said, 'I've behaved unjustly towards
an innocent man.

576
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:59,170
I cannot shake his hand.'

577
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:05,740
With those words he bowed and left the office,
leaving M. Madeleine to stare at the papers

578
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,240
on his desk with an empty, puzzled look in
his eyes.

579
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,690
That afternoon, M. Madeleine visited Fantine.

580
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:23,270
She had a high fever, and was coughing badly,
but she still had only one thing on her mind.

581
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,270
'Cosette?'

582
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,270
she asked him.

583
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,730
'Very soon,' he assured her.

584
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:36,430
He sat by her bed for an hour and then, having
told the nurses to look after her, he returned

585
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,940
to his home.

586
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,480
He stayed awake all night, thinking of Javert's
story about Champmathieu.

587
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:53,609
The reader has probably already realized that
M. Madeleine was really Jean Valjean, and

588
00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:59,300
M. Madeleine - as we shall continue to call
him for this part of the story - knew that

589
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,020
he could not let Champmathieu go to prison
for crimes he had not committed.

590
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:11,410
He knew - although he was not happy to admit
this - that he would have to go to Arras and

591
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,260
tell the truth.

592
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,609
He would lose everything that he had worked
so hard to achieve.

593
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:24,180
He would also have to break his promise to
Fantine about bringing Cosette from Montfermeil.

594
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,480
But what choice did he have?

595
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,969
The truth was more important than anything
else.

596
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:32,969
***

597
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:36,579
The next morning, M. Madeleine set off on
the long journey to Arras.

598
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:42,830
It took him more than twelve hours, and when
he arrived, he discovered that Champmathieu's

599
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,300
trial had already started.

600
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,660
The courtroom was full but, because he was
such an important man, M. Madeleine was allowed

601
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,859
to sit behind the judge's chair.

602
00:44:54,859 --> 00:45:00,040
He watched as several witnesses swore on the
Bible that the man standing before the judge

603
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,650
was Jean Valjean.

604
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:09,349
Champmathieu, a large, simple-minded man,
denied everything when his chance came to

605
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:13,609
speak, but the crowd thought he was trying
to be funny.

606
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:19,930
The courtroom filled with laughter and Champmathieu
began to laugh himself, which did him no good

607
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,110
at all.

608
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:28,369
Finally, having heard all the evidence, the
judge called for silence.

609
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:35,190
He was preparing to announce his decision
when M. Madeleine, pale and trembling, stood

610
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,079
up and said:

611
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,430
'That man is not Jean Valjean.'

612
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:48,540
An excited whisper went around the courtroom
as everybody recognized M. Madeleine.

613
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:55,440
M. Madeleine waited for the whispers to stop
before announcing in a loud, clear voice that

614
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,860
he was Jean Valjean.

615
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,940
At first, no one believed him, but he managed
to persuade the court by skilfully questioning

616
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:10,730
each of the witnesses, revealing personal
information that only the real Jean Valjean

617
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,210
could have known.

618
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,490
When he had persuaded the court of the truth
of his confession, he was faced with a shocked

619
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,860
but respectful silence.

620
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,660
'I must leave now,' M. Madeleine finally said.

621
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,580
'I have important business to attend to.

622
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:36,380
You know where to find me, and I shall not
try to escape.'

623
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:42,010
Everybody stood to one side to let him pass
as he made his way towards the door.

624
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:49,089
When he had gone, the judge immediately allowed
Champmathieu to leave the court a free man.

625
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:56,119
Champmathieu went home in a state of total
confusion, thinking all men mad and understanding

626
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,170
nothing of what had happened.

627
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,170
***

628
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,119
At dawn the next day, M. Madeleine entered
Fantine's room.

629
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,420
'How is she?' he asked the nurse, who was
watching her as she slept.

630
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,250
'She seems better.

631
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,990
She's looking forward to seeing her child.'

632
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:22,619
'I haven't brought the child with me,' M.
Madeleine said.

633
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:26,950
'Then what can we say to her when she wakes
up?'

634
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,800
The nurse looked suddenly worried.

635
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,560
'It will destroy her if she doesn't see her
child now, after you promised to bring her.'

636
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,670
'God will guide me,' M. Madeleine sighed.

637
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:46,109
For some time M. Madeleine sat by the bedside
and watched Fantine while she slept.

638
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:51,550
She was breathing with great difficulty, but
her face looked peaceful and calm.

639
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:57,560
Suddenly, she opened her eyes and saw M. Madeleine.

640
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,589
'Cosette?'

641
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:01,099
she asked, with a soft smile.

642
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:06,510
'Later,' M. Madeleine said gently, taking
her hand.

643
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,640
'You're too weak to see her at the moment.

644
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,490
First you must get well.'

645
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:19,250
Fantine smiled, and began to talk dreamily
about her future life with her daughter, and

646
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,230
how happy they would be together.

647
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:28,140
But suddenly her face froze, and she stared
with horror at the door.

648
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:35,210
M. Madeleine, who was holding her hand, turned
and saw Inspector Javert.

649
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:40,670
Fantine, thinking that the inspector had come
for her, gripped M. Madeleine's hand tightly

650
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,849
and begged him to protect her.

651
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:44,859
'Don't be afraid.'

652
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:47,579
M. Madeleine tried to calm her.

653
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:50,020
'He hasn't come for you.'

654
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,710
Then, gently rising from his chair, he moved
towards Javert.

655
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:03,490
'I know what you've come for,' he said quietly
so that Fantine wouldn't hear.

656
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,930
'But give me three days, please.

657
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:07,930
That's all I ask.

658
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,190
Three days to fetch this unfortunate woman's
child.

659
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,000
I'll pay anything you like.'

660
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,589
'Do you think I'm stupid?'

661
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:19,720
Javert gave an unpleasant laugh.

662
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,319
'Three days to escape, you mean.'

663
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:29,180
Fantine, who had heard what M. Madeleine said,
despite his efforts to speak quietly, began

664
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,510
to tremble.

665
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,599
'To fetch my child?'

666
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,599
she cried.

667
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:36,020
'Isn't she here?

668
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,890
Nurse, answer me... where's my little Cosette?

669
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,319
I want to see her.

670
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:44,319
M. Madeleine

671
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:50,710
'Be quiet, you dirty prostitute,' Javert interrupted
her angrily.

672
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,950
'There is no Monsieur Madeleine.

673
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,430
This man's name is Jean Valjean, and he's
a criminal no better than you are.

674
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:03,119
And you can forget all that nonsense about
your child.

675
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,910
Fantine suddenly sat up.

676
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,200
She stared wildly at the two men, then turned
to the nurse.

677
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,660
She looked as if she was going to speak, but
no words came from her lips.

678
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:25,380
Instead, with a small sigh, she fell back
against her pillow and lay completely still.

679
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:32,410
Jean Valjean (as we must now call him) shook
Javert's hand from his collar and ran to the

680
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,049
bed.

681
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:40,490
He gazed into Fantine's eyes and knew immediately
that she was dead.

682
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:46,220
'You've killed her!' he cried angrily, turning
to Javert with a fierce look in his eyes.

683
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:52,440
'I didn't come here to argue,' Javert said,
stepping back nervously, afraid that Valjean

684
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,680
was going to attack him.

685
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,799
'If you don't come with me now, I'll have
to call my men.'

686
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:04,589
Valjean looked around the room, thinking for
a second of making his escape.

687
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:07,890
But the idea did not last for long.

688
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:14,079
He turned again to Fantine and looked for
one last time at her sad, pale face and empty,

689
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,329
blue eyes.

690
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:21,309
Bending down, he closed her eyes and pressed
his lips against her forehead.

691
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:26,170
Then he rose and turned back to Javert.

692
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,549
'I'm ready now,' he said.

693
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:35,569
News of M. Madeleine's arrest spread quickly
around the town.

694
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:38,000
Most people pretended not to be surprised.

695
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,620
'We always knew there was something strange
about him,' they said.

696
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:50,660
Two days after his arrest, Jean Valjean escaped
from prison.

697
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,210
The bars of his window had been broken during
the night.

698
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,510
Again, most people pretended not to be surprised.

699
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:05,720
'It takes more than a small town prison to
hold a man as strong as that,' they all agreed.

700
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,790
CHAPTER FOUR

701
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:12,130
The Man in the Long Yellow Coat

702
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:19,109
Christmas 1823 was especially lively and colourful
in the village of Montfermeil.

703
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:24,060
Entertainers and traders from Paris set up
their stalls in the streets, and business

704
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,680
at the Thenardiers' inn was very good.

705
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:34,041
While guests and visitors ate and drank noisily,
Cosette - now eight years old - sat in her

706
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:37,619
usual place under the kitchen table.

707
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:44,190
Dressed in rags, she knitted woollen stockings
for Eponine and Azelma.

708
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:49,470
One evening, Madame Thenardier ordered Cosette
out into the cold to fetch water.

709
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:55,360
The nearest water supply was half-way down
the wooded hill on which Montfermeil stood,

710
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,890
and Cosette hated fetching water, especially
in the dark.

711
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:06,050
Miserably, she picked up a large, empty bucket
that was almost as big as she was, and was

712
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,549
walking with it to the door when Madame Thenardier
stopped her.

713
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:15,840
'Buy some bread on the way,' she said, giving
the girl some money.

714
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,540
Cosette took the coin, put it carefully in
her pocket and left.

715
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:26,420
She was cold and hungry as she dragged the
bucket behind her along the crowded street,

716
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,340
but she could not resist stopping in front
of one of the stalls.

717
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:36,720
It was like a palace to her, with its bright
lights, shining glass and pretty objects.

718
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,420
But the object that most attracted Cosette's
attention was a large, golden-haired doll

719
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,040
in a beautiful long pink dress.

720
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:51,480
All the children in Montfermeil had gazed
with wonder at this doll, but nobody in the

721
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,309
village had enough money to buy it.

722
00:53:55,309 --> 00:54:01,880
Cosette gazed at the doll for several minutes
but, remembering her job, she sighed and continued

723
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,430
on her way.

724
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:09,060
She had soon left the colourful lights and
the happy laughter of the village behind her,

725
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:14,319
and was running down the hill into the frightening
darkness of the wood.

726
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,720
Finding the stream, she bent forward and began
to till her bucket.

727
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,599
She did not notice the coin that Mme Thenardier
had given her for the bread fall out of her

728
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,610
pocket into the water.

729
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:34,320
When the bucket was full, she gripped the
handle with her tiny, frozen hands and tried

730
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,760
to pull it back up the hill.

731
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,510
But the bucket was so heavy that, after a
dozen steps, she had to stop for a rest.

732
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:47,579
She managed a few more steps, and stopped
again.

733
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:52,089
Her progress became slower and slower.

734
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:59,170
She was almost at the end of her strength,
and she was still not out of the wood.

735
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,910
Leaning against a tree, she cried aloud:

736
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,839
'Oh God help me!

737
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,890
Please, dear God!'

738
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:14,900
Suddenly, an enormous hand reached down from
the sky and took the bucket of water from

739
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,740
her.

740
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,680
Looking up, Cosette saw a huge, white-haired
man standing next to her.

741
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,089
He looked very strange with his tall black
hat and long yellow coat.

742
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:36,119
'This is a very heavy bucket for such a small
child,' he said gently, looking down at her

743
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:37,960
from his great height.

744
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,890
For some reason, Cosette was not afraid.

745
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:48,340
There was something about his eyes, tilled
with a strange sadness, that she liked and

746
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,950
trusted.

747
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,330
She let him carry the bucket up the hill and,
as they walked back towards the village, she

748
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:00,180
told him everything about her life with the
Thenardiers.

749
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:05,900
The old man listened with great interest,
and asked her many questions.

750
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:11,490
As they were approaching the inn, Cosette
turned to him and said, 'May I have the bucket

751
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,490
now?

752
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:19,070
If Mme Thenardier sees that someone has been
helping me, she'll beat me.'

753
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:23,640
The old man gave her the bucket, and they
entered the inn together.

754
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,880
'What took you so long?'

755
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,020
Mme Thenardier said angrily when she saw the
little girl.

756
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,690
'This gentleman wants a room for the night,'
Cosette said, trembling with fear, expecting

757
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,130
to be beaten.

758
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,900
Mme Thenardier glanced at the old man without
interest.

759
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,450
She could tell from his clothes that he probably
had no money.

760
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,869
'I'm sorry, the rooms are full,' she said.

761
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:55,510
'I can pay the price of a room,' the old man
said.

762
00:56:55,510 --> 00:57:02,880
'Forty sous,' Mme Thenardier replied (although
the usual price was twenty).

763
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,260
'Forty sous,' the man agreed.

764
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:11,990
He sat down and Cosette, after serving him
some wine, returned to her place under the

765
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,280
table.

766
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,180
But before she could start her knitting, she
heard Mme Thenardier's angry voice demanding,

767
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,839
'Where's the bread I told you to get?'

768
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:28,560
Cosette, who had forgotten about the bread,
came out from under the table.

769
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,410
'The baker's was shut,' she lied.

770
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,869
'Well, give me back the money.'

771
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:40,069
Cosette felt in her pocket and suddenly went
pale.

772
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:42,000
The coin was not there.

773
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,059
'I'm waiting,' Mme Thenardier said threateningly.

774
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:52,309
Cosette said nothing, speechless with fear
as the woman raised her arm to hit her.

775
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:56,640
But before she could deliver the blow the
old man, who had seen everything, interrupted

776
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,079
her.

777
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,309
'Madame, I've just noticed this on the floor.

778
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:04,359
It must have fallen from the child's pocket.'

779
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:12,470
Mme Thenardier took the coin the old man held
towards her and walked away.

780
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:18,589
At that moment the door opened and Eponine
and Azelma appeared.

781
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:24,660
They were two healthy girls, the old man noticed,
dressed in warm clothes and with pink, healthy

782
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,109
cheeks.

783
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:30,200
After hugging and kissing their mother, they
sat on the floor by the fire and played with

784
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,940
a doll.

785
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,410
Cosette, who had returned to her place under
the table, looked up from her knitting and

786
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,260
watched them sadly.

787
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,500
A short time later, the girls grew bored with
their game.

788
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,240
They left the doll on the floor and went off
to play with a baby cat.

789
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:53,859
Cosette, checking that no one was watching,
reached out and picked up the doll.

790
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:57,849
She turned her back on the room and began
to play with it, hoping that no one could

791
00:58:57,849 --> 00:58:59,559
see what she was doing.

792
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:03,680
Her happiness did not last long, however.

793
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,380
The two girls, when they saw Cosette with
their doll, ran crying to their mother.

794
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:15,059
Mme Thenardier rushed across the room towards
Cosette who, afraid that she would be punished,

795
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:19,010
put the doll gently on the floor and began
to cry.

796
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,380
'What's the matter?'

797
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,890
the old man said, rising to his feet.

798
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:25,480
'Can't you see?'

799
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,220
Mme Thenardier said, red with anger.

800
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,569
'That nasty little girl, who isn't even my
own daughter, who I feed and look after out

801
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:37,590
of the kindness of my heart, has been playing
with my daughters' doll.'

802
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:43,090
'I don't understand,' the old man said.

803
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,450
'She's touched it with her dirty hands!'

804
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:53,829
Then, hearing Cosette crying, she turned to
the little girl and shouted, 'Stop that noise!'

805
00:59:53,829 --> 01:00:01,190
The old man left the inn and, minutes later,
returned with something in his hands: the

806
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:04,950
beautiful doll from the stall across the road.

807
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:11,230
'Here,' he said softly, placing it gently
on the floor in front of Cosette.

808
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,920
'It's for you.'

809
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,130
There was a sudden silence in the room.

810
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:22,030
Mme Thenardier, Eponine and Azelma stood absolutely
still.

811
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:28,270
The drinkers at the other tables paused, glasses
half-way to their lips, and stared with disbelief.

812
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:30,780
'What kind of man is this?'

813
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,970
they thought.

814
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:39,270
'He dresses so poorly but can afford to buy
the most expensive doll in Montfermeil!'

815
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:43,619
The Thenardiers gave the old man their best
room for the night.

816
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:49,630
The next morning they gave him the bill, charging
him three times the usual price for a meal

817
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,130
and a bed for the night.

818
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:57,150
They waited nervously while the man studied
the bill carefully, expecting him to complain

819
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,070
or cause trouble.

820
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:06,069
Finally, he looked up from the bill without
expression and said, 'Tell me, is business

821
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:08,589
good here in Montfermeil?'

822
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:13,799
'Times are very hard,' Mme Thenardier replied
immediately.

823
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,020
'This is a poor country.

824
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,440
I don't know how we would manage without the
occasional rich and generous traveller like

825
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,980
yourself.

826
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,440
We have so many expenses.

827
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,960
That child, for instance - you've no idea
how much she costs.

828
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,010
We have our own daughters to look after.

829
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:35,500
I can't afford to look after other people's
children, too.'

830
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:42,930
'What would you say,' the old man said after
a moment's thought, 'if I offered to take

831
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,599
the child from you?'

832
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,309
'Oh!'

833
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,270
Madame Thenardiers face brightened.

834
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,609
'That would be wonderful.'

835
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:54,420
'Just a minute,' her husband said.

836
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,119
'We love that child very much.

837
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,049
It's true we're poor, and we have bad debts,
but love is more important than money.'

838
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:05,890
'How much do you need?'

839
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:10,500
the old man asked, taking an old leather wallet
from the pocket of his coat.

840
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:18,310
'1500 francs,' Thenardier, who had already
done his arithmetic, replied.

841
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:25,490
The old man put three 500-franc notes on the
table and said, without smiling, 'Now fetch

842
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,490
Cosette.'

843
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:34,190
When Cosette came downstairs, the old man
gave her new clothes to wear: a black woollen

844
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:37,349
dress, black stockings, scarf and shoes.

845
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:43,500
Half an hour later, the people of Montfermeil
saw an old man in a tall hat and long yellow

846
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:51,690
coat walking along the road to Paris, hand-in-hand
with a little girl dressed completely in black.

847
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,420
No one knew the man.

848
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:59,680
And, because she was carrying an expensive
doll and was no longer wearing rags, not many

849
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,089
recognized Cosette.

850
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:06,150
Cosette was leaving at last.

851
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,750
She did not know where to, or with whom.

852
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:15,789
But, as she held the old man's hand, she gazed
wide-eyed at the sky.

853
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:21,349
She had the strange but comforting feeling
that she was somehow travelling closer to

854
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:24,440
God.

855
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,039
CHAPTER FOUR

856
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,440
Valjean and Cosette

857
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,480
Somewhere on the outskirts of Paris, Jean
Valjean stopped outside a large, ancient building

858
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,820
with damp walls.

859
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:44,799
He took a key from the pocket of his long
yellow coat and opened the old wooden door.

860
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:50,460
He then carried Cosette, who was sleeping
in his arms, along a dark corridor and up

861
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,020
some stairs to the room he had rented since
his escape from Montreuil.

862
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:02,220
There was not much furniture in the room - just
an old bed, a mattress on the floor, a table,

863
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,550
some chairs and a lighted stove.

864
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:12,460
A streetlamp shone through the only window,
lighting the dark interior of the room.

865
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,930
Valjean laid Cosette on the bed without waking
her.

866
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:20,790
He lit a candle and sat by the bed, watching
her while she slept.

867
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:26,049
He felt sad that Fantine had not lived to
see her child again, but happy that he had

868
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:30,589
been able to rescue her child from the terrible
Thenardiers.

869
01:04:30,589 --> 01:04:36,730
He bent and kissed the sleeping child's forehead
just as, nine months earlier, he had kissed

870
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:39,440
her mother's.

871
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,710
The next morning, Cosette opened her eyes
and immediately started to get out of bed.

872
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:51,430
'I'm coming, Madame,' she yawned, blinded
by the bright winter's sunlight that was shining

873
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,210
into the room.

874
01:04:53,210 --> 01:05:00,390
Then, as her eyes adjusted to the light, she
saw the kind old face of Jean Valjean looking

875
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,820
down at her, and she relaxed.

876
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,940
'Of course!'

877
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,280
she cried with joy.

878
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,960
'It's all true.

879
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,680
I was afraid that it was just a dream.'

880
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,130
She hugged her doll and asked Valjean hundreds
of questions.

881
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:20,809
Finally, she asked him, 'Do you want me to
sweep the floor?'

882
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:22,369
'No,' he said.

883
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:26,920
'I just want you to enjoy yourself.'

884
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,210
The December days passed in great happiness
for Cosette and for Jean Valjean, too.

885
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:36,550
For twenty-five years he had been alone in
the world.

886
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,809
Nothing had ever touched his heart until he
had rescued Cosette.

887
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:47,010
Now, he discovered the greatest joy he had
ever known by just standing beside her bed

888
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,880
and looking at her innocent, trusting little
face.

889
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,539
He had discovered love.

890
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:56,539
***

891
01:05:56,539 --> 01:06:00,799
After escaping from Montreuil, Jean Valjean
had taken all his money from the bank and

892
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:05,299
buried it in a forest near Montfermeil.

893
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:10,140
Although he was rich, he had chosen a room
in a poor part of Paris, where nobody would

894
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,670
find him.

895
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:17,250
His only neighbour was an old woman, who did
his housework and kept his stove burning.

896
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:22,339
Paying her six months in advance, he told
her that he was a ruined Spanish gentleman,

897
01:06:22,339 --> 01:06:27,059
and that the little girl was his granddaughter.

898
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:30,619
Weeks passed, and the two lived happily.

899
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:35,550
Valjean gave Cosette lessons in reading and
writing, and spent hours watching her as she

900
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,819
dressed and undressed her doll.

901
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:42,810
To avoid being seen, he never went out during
the day.

902
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:49,020
He walked for a couple of hours every evening,
sometimes alone, sometimes with Cosette.

903
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:53,869
He often gave money to beggars, which was
unwise, because he soon became known in the

904
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:59,369
area as 'the beggar who gives money to beggars'.

905
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:04,390
One evening, towards the end of winter, Valjean
gave some money to a beggar sitting under

906
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:07,500
a streetlamp outside a church.

907
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:13,760
The beggar raised his face and stared hard
at Valjean for just a second, then quickly

908
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,170
bowed his head.

909
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,990
This gave Valjean a shock.

910
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:25,779
Although he had only seen the beggar's face
for a second, it had seemed strangely familiar.

911
01:07:25,779 --> 01:07:30,309
'I'm going mad,' he thought, as he walked
home.

912
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:34,640
The next evening he returned to the steetlamp
outside the church.

913
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:40,079
The beggar was still there, in the same position,
wearing the same clothes.

914
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:44,200
This time, Valjean spoke to him as he gave
him some money.

915
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,970
The beggar laughed and joked with him, and
Valjean returned that evening a happier man.

916
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:55,330
'I must have been dreaming yesterday,' he
laughed to himself.

917
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:02,609
'But for a second, there was something about
the beggars eyes that reminded me of Javert.

918
01:08:02,609 --> 01:08:05,579
How could I have thought such a thing?

919
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:09,750
After speaking to him this evening, I can
see that he doesn't look like the inspector

920
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,640
at all.'

921
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,230
A few evenings later, while he was giving
Cosette a reading lesson in his room, Valjean

922
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,950
heard the front door of the house open and
close.

923
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:22,950
This was unusual.

924
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:28,720
The old woman, the only other person who lived
in the building, always went to bed before

925
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,719
nightfall.

926
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,690
Valjean signalled to Cosette to keep quiet.

927
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:37,449
Someone was coming up the stairs.

928
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:43,239
He blew out the candle and, just as he was
kissing Cosette on the forehead, the footsteps

929
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:44,929
stopped.

930
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:46,790
Valjean did not move.

931
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:51,640
He sat in his chair with his back to the door
and held his breath.

932
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,890
A few minutes later, having heard only silence,
he turned round.

933
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:01,290
A light was shining through a crack in his
door.

934
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:06,770
Someone with a candle was standing outside
his room.

935
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:11,949
Several minutes passed, and then the light
disappeared.

936
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:17,200
Valjean quietly lay down on the mattress on
his floor, but he could not close his eyes

937
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,700
all night.

938
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:25,409
At daybreak, as he was falling asleep at last,
he heard footsteps in the corridor outside

939
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:27,870
his room again.

940
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:33,850
Running to the door, he put his eye to the
large keyhole and saw the back view of a man

941
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:36,470
who was walking towards the stairs.

942
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:42,580
A tall man in a long coat with a stick under
his arm.

943
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:47,950
Valjean's heart almost stopped beating and
he began to sweat.

944
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:53,510
'Javert,' he breathed to himself.

945
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,510
***

946
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,060
Valjean spent all day making preparations
to leave.

947
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:01,400
It was too dangerous for him and Cosette to
stay there another night.

948
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,620
That evening, he went downstairs and looked
up and down the street.

949
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:12,330
It seemed empty, although he could not see
into the shadows behind the trees.

950
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:17,890
He went back upstairs for Cosette, who was
waiting for him patiently, holding her doll.

951
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,060
'Come along,' he said.

952
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,000
'It's time to leave.'

953
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,560
Cosette took his hand, and went with him down
the stairs.

954
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:35,710
There was a full moon, and this pleased Valjean
as he moved quickly along the narrow streets.

955
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:40,420
By keeping close to the walls in the shadows,
he could clearly see what was happening in

956
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,370
the light.

957
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:46,800
After a while, he felt confident that he and
Cosette were not being followed.

958
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:54,199
But, as the church bells of the city struck
eleven o'clock, something made him look back.

959
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:59,800
In the light of a lamp above a doorway, he
saw four men moving along the street in his

960
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,310
direction.

961
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,790
He gripped Cosette's hand and began to walk
more quickly.

962
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:10,480
Every few minutes, he stopped in the shadows
of a doorway or at the corner of a street

963
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
to look back.

964
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,480
The four men were still following him.

965
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:22,790
He could see their faces clearly in the moonlight,
and one of them belonged to Inspector Javert.

966
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:27,489
By now, Cosette was exhausted.

967
01:11:27,489 --> 01:11:32,330
Valjean picked her up and ran with her through
a confusing system of alleys until he came

968
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,580
to a bridge.

969
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:39,490
On the other side of the river, he stopped
at the entrance of a high-walled alley and

970
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,390
looked back.

971
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:47,060
He could see four figures in the distance
on the far side of the bridge.

972
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:52,210
Walking more slowly now, thinking he was safe
from his pursuers, Valjean followed the alley

973
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:57,020
until he came to a lane that seemed to lead
away from the city.

974
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:02,250
He walked along this lane for a long time
until, to his horror, he discovered his way

975
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,480
blocked by a high wall.

976
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:11,000
There was no way forward, but as he was turning
back, he saw movements in the distance and

977
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,260
the flash of moonlight on metal.

978
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:20,440
Seven or eight soldiers were moving slowly
along the lane in his direction.

979
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:25,300
Valjean looked desperately for an escape from
the alley, but could see none.

980
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,890
On one side of him was a tall building, all
its doors and windows covered with metal bars.

981
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:35,289
On the other side there was a wall, higher
than a tree.

982
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:40,409
He would be able to climb the wall on his
own, but how could he carry Cosette?

983
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:43,360
Suddenly, he had an idea.

984
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:50,250
He ran to a nearby streetlight and pulled
some wire from a metal box at its base.

985
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:57,750
He tied one end of the wire around Cosette's
waist, climbed the wall and, with great difficulty,

986
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,770
pulled the girl up behind him.

987
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,090
He was only just in time.

988
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:08,389
There was a tree on the other side of the
wall, and Valjean carried Cosette down into

989
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:12,850
its branches just as the soldiers arrived.

990
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,679
'He must be here!'

991
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,860
He heard Javert's voice clearly on the other
side of the wall.

992
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,699
'He can't have escaped.

993
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:22,020
There's no way out!'

994
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:28,750
At last, the soldiers gave up their search
and went back in the direction they had come.

995
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:36,230
Valjean hugged Cosette tightly with relief,
knowing that at last they were both safe.

996
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:38,710
CHAPTER SIX

997
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,179
Marius

998
01:13:41,179 --> 01:13:47,610
On the night after the Battle of Waterloo,
in June 1815, a robber moved quietly around

999
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:53,020
the battlefield, stealing money and jewellery
from the bodies of dead soldiers.

1000
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:58,580
He saw a hand sticking out from a pile of
dead men and horses, a gold ring on its middle

1001
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,190
finger, shining in the moonlight.

1002
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:07,920
The robber took the ring but, as he turned
to leave, the hand grabbed his jacket.

1003
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,830
The robber pulled the body from the pile of
bodies and saw that he had rescued a French

1004
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:13,860
officer.

1005
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,199
The man had a terrible wound in his head,
but he was still alive.

1006
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:21,990
'Thank you,' the officer whispered.

1007
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,389
'You've saved my life.

1008
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:27,810
What's your name?'

1009
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,520
'Thenardier,' the robber replied.

1010
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,420
'I shall not forget that name,' the officer
replied.

1011
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,700
'And you must remember mine.

1012
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:43,120
My name's Pontmercy.'

1013
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,470
Without another word, the robber took the
wounded man's watch and purse, and disappeared

1014
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:50,220
into the night.

1015
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:55,450
Georges Pontmercy was married with a young
son.

1016
01:14:55,450 --> 01:15:02,139
He survived the Battle of Waterloo but unfortunately,
in the same year, his wife died.

1017
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:08,370
His father-in-law, M. Gillenormand, was a
very wealthy man, but the two men hated each

1018
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,370
other.

1019
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:13,989
M. Gillenormand hated everybody who liked
Napoleon.

1020
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:18,699
He thought that Pontmercy was no better than
a beggar, a penniless adventurer who only

1021
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:19,970
wanted his money.

1022
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:25,580
Pontmercy thought that M. Gillenormand was
an old fool.

1023
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:32,679
When his daughter died, M. Gillenormand made
Pontmercy an offer which he could not refuse.

1024
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:37,320
'You have no money, and I am rich,' he said.

1025
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,239
'If you want to keep your son, Marius, I'll
give you no money.

1026
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:50,970
But if you give the boy to me, and promise
never to see him again, I'll look after him.'

1027
01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:57,699
Pontmercy, wanting his son to have a good
life, had sadly given him to M. Gillenormand

1028
01:15:57,699 --> 01:16:02,929
and never saw his son or father-in-law again.

1029
01:16:02,929 --> 01:16:07,250
Marius grew up with his grandfather, and never
knew his father.

1030
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:12,949
M. Gillenormand always told him that his father
had been no good - that he was a poor soldier

1031
01:16:12,949 --> 01:16:17,469
and a drunk who had abandoned him after his
mother's death.

1032
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:22,949
For many years, Marius believed this, but
when he was seventeen years old, he learnt

1033
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:24,390
the truth.

1034
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:29,120
His father, a brave officer who had fought
for Napoleon and nearly died at the Battle

1035
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:34,880
of Waterloo, had really loved him and his
mother very much.

1036
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,420
Without telling his grandfather, Marius tried
to contact his father and finally discovered

1037
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,389
where he was living.

1038
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:46,560
He went at once to visit him, but he was too
late.

1039
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,100
His father had just died.

1040
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:56,310
A poor man, Georges Pontmercy had left his
son nothing apart from a letter:

1041
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,050
For my son.

1042
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,670
My life was saved at Waterloo by a sergeant.

1043
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,850
His name was Thenardier.

1044
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:10,060
I believe that he recently managed a small
inn in the village of Montfermeil, not far

1045
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,790
from Paris.

1046
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:19,890
If you ever find this man, I want you to help
him in any way you can.

1047
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:24,990
Marius returned to Paris, but continued to
visit his father's grave regularly, without

1048
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:27,739
telling his grandfather.

1049
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:31,560
One day, however, his grandfather discovered
what he was doing.

1050
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:38,579
They had a big quarrel, and M. Gillenormand
ordered Marius to leave his house.

1051
01:17:38,579 --> 01:17:39,579
***

1052
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:43,600
For the next three years, Marius lived in
a small room in an old, damp-walled building

1053
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,810
on the outskirts of Paris - the same room
that Valjean and Cosette had lived in eight

1054
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:52,250
years earlier.

1055
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:57,200
He gave up studying law and earned his living
by working in a bookshop and helping to write

1056
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,739
dictionaries.

1057
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:03,870
He did not earn very much money, but it was
enough for the rent and simple meals.

1058
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:10,390
He rarely bought new clothes, but he was proud
of the fact that he had never been in debt.

1059
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:15,929
His grandfather often tried to send him money,
but Marius always returned it.

1060
01:18:15,929 --> 01:18:22,239
He hated his grandfather for the unjust, cruel
way he had treated his poor father.

1061
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:27,530
Life was hard for him, but he never forgot
the promise he had made his father: that he

1062
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:33,469
would find Thenardier, the man who had saved
his father's life, and help him in any way

1063
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:36,330
he could.

1064
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:41,239
Marius was a handsome young man, but he was
also extremely shy.

1065
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:46,660
When girls looked at him and smiled, he thought
they were laughing at his old clothes.

1066
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:52,230
In fact, they were attracted by his good looks,
but he was not confident enough to realize

1067
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,230
this.

1068
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:59,900
As a result, he had no girlfriend, but he
was happy with his books.

1069
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:05,130
'You shouldn't stay alone all the time,' his
good friend, Enjolras, said to him.

1070
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:07,020
'You should get out more.

1071
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,389
Give the girls a chance.

1072
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:11,260
They'd be good for you, Marius.

1073
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,929
Otherwise you'll turn into a priest!'

1074
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:20,429
Marius paid little attention to his friend,
and continued his quiet life of work, study

1075
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:23,290
and daily walks.

1076
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:28,800
While walking around his part of the city,
Marius had noticed in elderly man and a young

1077
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,570
girl in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1078
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:34,830
They always sat next to each other on the
same bench.

1079
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:41,449
The man, who was perhaps sixty, had white
hair and a serious but friendly-looking face.

1080
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:48,090
The girl, who was aged thirteen or fourteen,
always wore the same badly-cut black dress.

1081
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:55,060
She was very thin, almost ugly, but Marius
noticed that she had lovely blue eyes.

1082
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:58,719
They seemed to be father and daughter.

1083
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,719
Marius saw this couple frequently on his regular
walks in the Gardens.

1084
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:08,769
But, although he was very interested in them,
they seemed not to notice him at all.

1085
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:13,790
The girl was always talking happily, while
the man said very little.

1086
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:19,300
He just looked at the girl from time to time
with an affectionate, fatherly smile.

1087
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:23,330
Enjolras had often seen the couple, too.

1088
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:26,429
'Do you know who they are?'

1089
01:20:26,429 --> 01:20:28,420
Marius asked him one day.

1090
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:36,181
'I call the man M. Leblanc, because of his
white hair, and the girl Mile Lanoire, because

1091
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:41,290
of her black dress,' his friend replied.

1092
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,290
***

1093
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:46,420
For almost a year, Marius saw the old man
and the young girl daily in the same place

1094
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:48,179
at the same time.

1095
01:20:48,179 --> 01:20:54,140
Then, for some reason, Marius stopped going
to the Luxembourg Gardens.

1096
01:20:54,140 --> 01:21:00,360
When he returned, one summer morning six months
later, he saw the same couple sitting on the

1097
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,560
same bench, but something amazing had happened.

1098
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:11,929
The man was the same, but the thin, plain
girl of six months earlier had become a beautiful

1099
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:12,929
young woman.

1100
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:18,659
Her rough black dress had been replaced by
one of fine black silk.

1101
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:25,770
She had soft brown hair, pale, smooth skin,
deep blue eyes and a lovely smile that lit

1102
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:29,239
up her face like sunshine.

1103
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:34,580
She looked up when Marius passed for the second
time, and gave him a casual glance.

1104
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:39,679
Marius, however, walked on, thinking of other
things.

1105
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:45,070
For the next few days he passed the bench
in the Gardens without looking at her.

1106
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:50,370
Then one day, as he was passing, thinking
about nothing in particular, the girl looked

1107
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,500
up at him and their eyes met.

1108
01:21:53,500 --> 01:22:01,179
A second later she looked away and Marius
walked on but, in a strange way, he knew his

1109
01:22:01,179 --> 01:22:03,640
life had changed.

1110
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:08,960
What he had experienced in that moment was
not the honest, innocent gaze of a child.

1111
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,770
It was something more than that.

1112
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:19,730
Whatever it was, Marius sensed that, after
that moment, his life would never be the same.

1113
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:25,040
The next day, Marius returned to the Luxembourg
Gardens wearing his best clothes.

1114
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:30,690
He walked around slowly, stopping to look
at the ducks on the lake, then casually approached

1115
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:35,679
the bench where Mile Lanoire and her father
were sitting.

1116
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:41,330
As he walked past, he kept his eyes fixed
on the girl, but she did not seem to notice

1117
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,740
him.

1118
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:47,560
She was talking quietly to her father, and
Marius could hear the soft, exciting murmur

1119
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,929
of her voice.

1120
01:22:49,929 --> 01:22:56,260
Without intending to, he stopped, turned round
and walked past the bench again.

1121
01:22:56,260 --> 01:23:00,179
He felt his face go red and his heart beat
loudly in his chest.

1122
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:04,830
He was sure, this time, that she had watched
him as he passed.

1123
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:11,380
He did not go back a third time, but sat down
on a bench at the opposite end of the Gardens.

1124
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,590
He looked at the girl out of the corner of
his eye.

1125
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:20,219
She seemed to fill the far end of the Gardens
with a kind of blue mist.

1126
01:23:20,219 --> 01:23:25,330
Taking a deep breath, he rose and was going
to pass the bench for a third time when he

1127
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,810
stopped.

1128
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:32,770
He suddenly realized that, in his feverish
state, he had forgotten about the old man.

1129
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:37,490
What would he be thinking when he saw a strange
young man walking backwards and forwards in

1130
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:40,210
front of his bench?

1131
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:45,989
Without another thought, Marius left the Gardens
and went home.

1132
01:23:45,989 --> 01:23:51,410
He returned the next morning and sat on a
bench all day, pretending to read a book,

1133
01:23:51,410 --> 01:23:56,330
not daring to go near the bench where the
girl and her father were sitting.

1134
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:00,790
He did the same every day for two weeks.

1135
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:05,260
Towards the end of the second week, while
Marius was sitting in his usual place, he

1136
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,280
looked up from his book.

1137
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,840
And his face went pale.

1138
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,760
Something had happened at the far end of the
Gardens.

1139
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:18,520
M. Leblanc and his daughter had risen from
their bench and were slowly walking in his

1140
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,340
direction.

1141
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:25,700
Marius shut his book, opened it again and
made an effort to read.

1142
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:31,760
When he felt that they were near him, he looked
up and saw that the girl was looking steadily

1143
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:38,690
at him with a soft, thoughtful gaze that made
him tremble from head to foot.

1144
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:44,250
He gazed after her until she had disappeared
from sight, then rose to his feet and walked

1145
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:48,060
around, laughing and talking to himself.

1146
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:53,010
Finally he left the Gardens in the mad hope
of seeing her in the street, but instead he

1147
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:58,090
met Enjolras, who invited him to a meal.

1148
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:03,310
Every day for the next month, Marius went
to the Luxembourg Gardens, excited by knowing

1149
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:08,369
that the girl was secretly looking at him,
but too shy and embarrassed to know what to

1150
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,100
do.

1151
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:15,080
He avoided walking directly in front of the
bench, partly from shyness, partly because

1152
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:19,250
he did not want to attract her father's attention.

1153
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:23,429
Sometimes he stood for half an hour in a place
where her father could not see him, looking

1154
01:25:23,429 --> 01:25:29,699
at her and enjoying the small, secret smiles
she sent him.

1155
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:35,290
But it seemed that M. Leblanc had begun to
suspect what was happening because often,

1156
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:42,380
when Marius appeared, he got to his feet and
walked away, taking his daughter with him.

1157
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,490
Sometimes M. Leblanc took his daughter to
a different bench, to see if Marius would

1158
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:48,930
follow them.

1159
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:54,679
Marius failed to understand the trick, and
made the mistake of doing so.

1160
01:25:54,679 --> 01:25:59,850
Then M. Leblanc became irregular in his visits
and did not always bring his daughter with

1161
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:01,670
him.

1162
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:07,900
When this happened, Marius did not stay in
the Gardens, which was another mistake.

1163
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:11,380
Marius was too much in love to think clearly.

1164
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:17,239
His desire for the girl was growing daily,
and he dreamt of her every night.

1165
01:26:17,239 --> 01:26:22,389
One evening, he found a handkerchief lying
on the bench which M. Leblanc and his daughter

1166
01:26:22,389 --> 01:26:24,239
had just left.

1167
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:32,040
It was a plain, white handkerchief with the
initials U.F. in one corner.

1168
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,850
'Ursula.'

1169
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,510
Marius said the first name that came into
his head.

1170
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,810
'A delicious name!'

1171
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:44,150
He kissed the handkerchief, breathed in its
perfume, wore it next to his heart by day

1172
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:46,830
and kept it under his pillow at night.

1173
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:52,400
'I can feel her whole soul in it!' he told
himself

1174
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:58,530
In fact, the handkerchief belonged to M. Leblanc
and had simply fallen out of his pocket, but

1175
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:01,600
Marius was unaware of this.

1176
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,989
He never appeared in the Luxembourg Gardens
without the handkerchief pressed to his lips

1177
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:07,880
or his heart.

1178
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:14,020
The girl could not understand his behaviour
at all, and looked at him with a puzzled expression.

1179
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,760
'Such modesty!'

1180
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,500
Marius sighed.

1181
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:23,830
Eventually, Marius was not satisfied with
just knowing the girl's name; he wanted to

1182
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,380
know where she lived.

1183
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:31,469
He found that she lived in a small house at
the quiet end of the rue de l'Ouest.

1184
01:27:31,469 --> 01:27:37,720
As well as the joy of seeing her in the Gardens,
he now had the pleasure of following her home.

1185
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:43,330
One evening, having followed them to the house
and watched them enter, he went in after them

1186
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,869
and spoke to the concierge.

1187
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:51,389
The concierge, however, became suspicious,
thinking that Marius was connected with the

1188
01:27:51,389 --> 01:27:55,659
police, and refused to say anything.

1189
01:27:55,659 --> 01:28:01,260
The following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter
did not come to the Gardens at all.

1190
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:06,949
They did not come for a whole week, and Marius
began to feel depressed.

1191
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:12,619
Every night he stood outside their house and
gazed up at their lighted windows.

1192
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:18,780
Sometimes he saw a shadow pass in front of
a lamp, and his heart beat faster.

1193
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,020
On the eighth night there was no light in
the windows.

1194
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:28,739
Marius waited, his heart aching with pain,
until finally going home.

1195
01:28:28,739 --> 01:28:33,790
The next day they did not go to the Gardens,
so again Marius went to the house as night

1196
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,830
was falling.

1197
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:38,969
Once again, there were no lights in the windows.

1198
01:28:38,969 --> 01:28:42,590
He knocked on the door and spoke to the concierge.

1199
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:46,980
'Where's the old gentleman?' he asked.

1200
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,489
'He's left.'

1201
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:52,180
Marius felt the blood leave his face.

1202
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:57,510
Almost fainting, he asked in a weak voice,
'When did he leave?'

1203
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:58,510
'Yesterday.'

1204
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:01,280
'Where has he gone?'

1205
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,540
'I've no idea.'

1206
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,180
'Did he leave an address?'

1207
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,139
The concierge then recognized Marius from
the previous week.

1208
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:15,080
He stared fiercely at him and said, 'So, it's
you again!

1209
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,489
I was right.

1210
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:19,600
You are some kind of policeman.'

1211
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:26,310
With those words he slammed the door in Marius's
face.

1212
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:27,889
CHAPTER SEVEN

1213
01:29:27,889 --> 01:29:30,770
The Jondrettes

1214
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:38,909
Summer and autumn passed, and winter came,
but Marius saw no sign of M. Leblanc or 'Ursula'.

1215
01:29:38,909 --> 01:29:42,350
He searched everywhere for them, but without
success.

1216
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:48,500
He became like a homeless dog, wandering the
streets in a mood of dark despair.

1217
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:56,489
Without 'Ursula', his life had become meaningless,
work disgusted him, walking tired him, solitude

1218
01:29:56,489 --> 01:29:57,960
bored him.

1219
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:02,290
'If only I hadn't followed them home,' he
told himself.

1220
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:07,861
'It gave me so much happiness just to look
at her, and now, through my stupidity, I've

1221
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:11,199
lost even that.'

1222
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:16,600
Enjolras and his other friends tried to cheer
him up by taking him to exciting places, but

1223
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:22,159
these expeditions always ended in the same
way: Marius would leave the group and walk

1224
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:27,520
around the streets of Paris unhappily on his
own.

1225
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,880
One cold but sunny afternoon in February,
Marius was walking along the street when two

1226
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,040
young girls dressed in rags ran into him.

1227
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:41,010
One was tall and thin, the other smaller.

1228
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:44,530
From what they were shouting at each other,
he understood that they were running from

1229
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:46,449
the police.

1230
01:30:46,449 --> 01:30:51,670
He stood for a moment staring after them as
they disappeared round a corner.

1231
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:57,670
Then he noticed a small parcel of papers lying
on the ground.

1232
01:30:57,670 --> 01:31:02,199
Realizing that one of the girls must have
dropped it, he picked it up and called after

1233
01:31:02,199 --> 01:31:04,630
them, but it was too late.

1234
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:08,239
The girls had already disappeared from sight.

1235
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:14,469
With a sigh, he put the package in his pocket
and went on to dinner.

1236
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:21,500
That night at home, Marius opened the package
and found that it contained four letters,

1237
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:28,889
all addressed to different people, and smelling
strongly of cheap tobacco.

1238
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:34,300
Marius read the four letters and discovered
that they were all asking for money.

1239
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:39,810
However, there was something strange about
them: although they all seemed to be written

1240
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:46,490
by different people, they were written on
the same rough paper in the same handwriting.

1241
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:52,139
He also noticed that each of them had similar
spelling mistakes.

1242
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:57,250
Thinking no more about it, he wrapped the
letters up again, threw them into a corner

1243
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,869
and went to bed.

1244
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:04,750
The next morning, while he was working, there
was a gentle knock on his door.

1245
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:11,330
'Come in,' Marius said, expecting it to be
the concierge, Mme Bougon.

1246
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:17,540
But the voice that answered, saying, 'I beg
your pardon, Monsieur,' was not that of Mme

1247
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,540
Bougon.

1248
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:22,380
It was more like the voice of a sick old man.

1249
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:29,090
Marius looked up quickly and saw that his
visitor was a thin girl wearing just a skirt

1250
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:30,650
and shirt.

1251
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:36,489
She looked cold and ill, and when she spoke,
Marius saw that she had lost several of her

1252
01:32:36,489 --> 01:32:37,900
teeth.

1253
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:44,030
There was, however, still a trace of beauty
in the sixteen-year-old lace, like pale sunlight

1254
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:48,270
beneath the thick clouds of a winter's dawn.

1255
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:53,120
Marius rose to his feet, sure that he had
seen the girl somewhere before.

1256
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,110
'What can I do for you, Mademoiselle?'

1257
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,110
he asked.

1258
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:02,389
'I've got a letter for you, M. Marius.'

1259
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:06,320
Marius opened the letter and read:

1260
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:12,719
My warm-hearted neighbour, I have heard of
how you kindly paid my rent for me six months

1261
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,020
ago.

1262
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,949
I thank you for it.

1263
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:22,030
But my eldest daughter will tell you that
my wife is sick and none of us have had any

1264
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,280
food for four days.

1265
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:30,550
Please, Monsieur, show us the kindness of
your generous heart again.

1266
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:33,739
My daughter is at your service.

1267
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:38,239
Yours truly, Jondrette.

1268
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:44,679
Marius realized at once that the handwriting,
the yellow paper and the smell of cheap tobacco

1269
01:33:44,679 --> 01:33:49,469
was the same as in the four letters he had
read the previous evening.

1270
01:33:49,469 --> 01:33:56,000
He now had five letters, all the work of one
author: the man who lived with his family

1271
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,830
in the next room.

1272
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:04,220
The Jondrette family had been Marius's neighbours
for many months, but he had never before paid

1273
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,409
much attention to them.

1274
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:10,659
This was why he had failed to recognize the
two daughters when they had run into him on

1275
01:34:10,659 --> 01:34:12,530
the street.

1276
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:18,420
But now he understood that Jondrette's business
was writing dishonest letters, asking for

1277
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:23,810
money from people he imagined were wealthier
than himself.

1278
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:29,320
Marius looked up from the letter and watched
the girl moving fearlessly around his room,

1279
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,869
studying the furniture and the mirror on the
wall.

1280
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:36,730
Her eyes lit up when she noticed the books
on his writing desk.

1281
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:37,730
'Books!'

1282
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:42,600
she said, and then added with pride, 'I know
how to read and write.

1283
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,600
Look, I'll show you.'

1284
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,470
Picking up a pen that lay on the table, she
wrote on a piece of paper, Be careful!

1285
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:52,580
The police are coming!

1286
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:57,680
She showed Marius her work and then, changing
the subject quickly, for no reason at all,

1287
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:06,659
she gazed into his eyes and said shyly, 'Do
you know, M. Marius, that you're a very handsome

1288
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:09,040
boy?'

1289
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:15,110
Approaching him, she rested a cold red hand
on his shoulder and said, 'You never notice

1290
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,600
me, M. Marius, but I know you.

1291
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:26,000
I see you on the stairs, and I see you walking
around the streets, looking so sad and alone.'

1292
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,060
Marius's cheeks went red.

1293
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:34,450
He moved away from the girl's touch and said,
'I think, Mademoiselle, that I have something

1294
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:37,050
belonging to you.'

1295
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:39,820
He handed her the parcel of letters.

1296
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:44,690
She clapped her hands and cried, 'We've been
looking for that everywhere!

1297
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:46,210
How did you know they were mine?

1298
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:47,600
Of course, the handwriting.

1299
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:53,120
You were the man we ran into last night.'

1300
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:57,409
While she talked excitedly, she took out one
of the letters.

1301
01:35:57,409 --> 01:36:01,380
'Ah, this is for the old man who goes to church
every day.

1302
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:05,260
If I hurry, I might be able to catch him.

1303
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,350
Perhaps he'll give me enough for a dinner.

1304
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,099
We haven't eaten for three days...

1305
01:36:09,099 --> 01:36:10,690
'

1306
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:15,449
Marius took a five-franc piece from his pocket
and handed it to the girl.

1307
01:36:15,449 --> 01:36:18,469
'The sun's come out at last!'

1308
01:36:18,469 --> 01:36:20,219
she cried, eagerly accepting the coin.

1309
01:36:20,219 --> 01:36:23,760
'That's enough food for two days.

1310
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,679
You're a real gentleman, Monsieur.'

1311
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:32,739
With those words, she gave a little laugh
and wave, grabbed some dry bread from the

1312
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:38,459
table and disappeared out of the door.

1313
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,459
***

1314
01:36:39,459 --> 01:36:44,230
Marius had lived for five years without much
money, but he had never been really poor.

1315
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:49,090
Now, after his conversation with the girl
from the next room, he understood what real

1316
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,640
poverty was.

1317
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:57,490
Only a thin wall separated him from the family
of lost souls in the room next door.

1318
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:04,380
He had heard them and seen them, but had paid
them no attention, and he suddenly felt guilty.

1319
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:10,540
'If they had had another neighbour,' he thought,
'one who had noticed their suffering, perhaps

1320
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:14,590
they could have been rescued by now.'

1321
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:19,080
As Marius was thinking about the sad life
of the family in the next room, he stared

1322
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,260
dreamily at the wall that separated them.

1323
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:29,060
Then, in the top corner near the ceiling,
Marius saw that there was a triangular hole.

1324
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:33,659
'Let's see what these people are really like,'
Marius thought.

1325
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:37,489
'Then I'll be in a better position to help
them.'

1326
01:37:37,489 --> 01:37:43,250
He stood on a cupboard, put his eye to the
hole, and looked through it into his neighbours'

1327
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,290
room.

1328
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:53,060
The Jondrettes' room was dirty and evil-smelling,
unlike Marius's bare but clean room.

1329
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:59,500
Its only furniture was a chair, an old table,
some cracked dishes and two dirty beds, one

1330
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,610
on each side of a fireplace.

1331
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:07,860
A man with a long, grey beard was sitting
at the table, writing a letter and smoking

1332
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,010
a pipe.

1333
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:15,840
A large woman with greying hair, once red,
was sitting by the fire, while a thin, pale-faced

1334
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,010
child sat on one of the beds.

1335
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:24,440
Marius, depressed at what he saw, was going
to get down from the cupboard when the door

1336
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:29,889
of the Jondrettes' room opened and the elder
girl came in.

1337
01:38:29,889 --> 01:38:35,800
Slamming the door shut behind her she cried
victoriously, 'He's coming!'

1338
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,880
'Who's coming?'

1339
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,280
Her father looked up.

1340
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,750
'The old man who goes to church.

1341
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,750
He's following me.

1342
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,679
I saw him with his daughter in the church,
and gave him the letter.

1343
01:38:46,679 --> 01:38:48,880
He said he would follow me here.

1344
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,130
I ran ahead to tell you he'll be here in two
minutes.'

1345
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:58,120
'You're a good girl,' the man said, rising
quickly to his feet.

1346
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,760
Then, turning to his wife, he said, 'Quickly!

1347
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,619
Put out the fire!'

1348
01:39:03,619 --> 01:39:09,510
While she poured water on the flames, the
man broke the chair with his foot and told

1349
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:12,500
his younger daughter to break a window.

1350
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:17,460
She put her fist through the glass and ran
to her bed, crying because her arm was covered

1351
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,400
in blood.

1352
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:26,250
'Excellent,' her father smiled, tearing a
piece off his shirt and using it as a bandage.

1353
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:29,409
'Now we're ready for the kind gentleman.

1354
01:39:29,409 --> 01:39:35,989
When he sees how miserable we are, he'll give
us a lot of money, you'll see.'

1355
01:39:35,989 --> 01:39:39,670
Moments later, there was a gentle knock on
the door.

1356
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:43,910
Jondrette rushed to open it, bowing almost
to the ground as he did so.

1357
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:46,489
'Please come in, my dear sir!

1358
01:39:46,489 --> 01:39:50,030
Please enter, with your charming young lady.'

1359
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:56,760
An elderly man and a young girl appeared in
the doorway and Marius, still looking through

1360
01:39:56,760 --> 01:40:00,719
the hole in the wall, could not believe his
eyes.

1361
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,469
It was She.

1362
01:40:04,469 --> 01:40:05,719
She!

1363
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:10,349
Everyone who has ever loved will feel the
force of that small word.

1364
01:40:10,349 --> 01:40:14,980
In the bright mist that clouded his vision,
Marius could hardly see the features of the

1365
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:20,930
sweet face that had lit his life for six months
and had then disappeared, filling his life

1366
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,679
with darkness.

1367
01:40:22,679 --> 01:40:26,830
And now the vision had reappeared!

1368
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:32,220
When Marius had recovered some of his senses,
he saw that she seemed a little paler than

1369
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,220
before.

1370
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:37,230
Her companion as usual was M. Leblanc.

1371
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:41,840
As she entered the room, she put a large parcel
on the table.

1372
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:49,270
'Monsieur, you will find some woollen stockings
and blankets in the parcel,' M. Leblanc told

1373
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,290
Jondrette.

1374
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:55,929
'You are extremely generous, Monsieur,' Jondrette
said, again bowing to the ground.

1375
01:40:55,929 --> 01:41:01,119
'But as you can see, we are unfortunate in
many ways.

1376
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:04,929
We are without food, Monsieur, and without
heating.

1377
01:41:04,929 --> 01:41:07,670
No warmth for my unhappy children.

1378
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,980
Our only chair is broken.

1379
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:12,639
A broken window - in this weather!

1380
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:17,170
My wife ill in bed and our younger daughter
injured.'

1381
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:24,389
'Oh, the poor child,' 'Ursula' said, seeing
the girl's bleeding wrist.

1382
01:41:24,389 --> 01:41:30,530
'She had an accident in the machine-shop where
she works for six sous an hour, 'Jondrette

1383
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:31,530
explained.

1384
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:35,760
'They may have to cut off her arm.'

1385
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:41,659
The daughter, taking her father's words seriously,
began to scream with fear.

1386
01:41:41,659 --> 01:41:47,290
While M. Leblanc and 'Ursula' tried to comfort
her, Jondrette approached his wife and said

1387
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:52,200
in a whisper, 'Take a good look at that man.'

1388
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,500
He then returned to M. Leblanc and told him
about his debts.

1389
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:01,160
'I owe sixty francs in rent,' he said.

1390
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:06,489
M. Leblanc took a coin out of his pocket and
put it on the table.

1391
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:09,120
'Five francs is all I have with me,' he said.

1392
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:16,909
'But I'll take my daughter home and come back
this evening with more money for you.'

1393
01:42:16,909 --> 01:42:22,730
Jondrette accompanied M. Leblanc and 'Ursula'
out of the door and, after a few minutes'

1394
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:27,900
indecision, Marius jumped down from the cupboard
and ran out into the street.

1395
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,599
But he was too late; their carriage had already
gone.

1396
01:42:31,599 --> 01:42:34,860
Miserably, he turned back to the house.

1397
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:41,150
He went into his room, pushing the door behind
him, but the door would not shut.

1398
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:45,290
Turning, Marius saw that a hand was holding
it open.

1399
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:48,619
'What is it?' he demanded.

1400
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:51,560
It was the Jondrette girl.

1401
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,590
'So it's you again,' he said almost fiercely.

1402
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:57,430
'What do you want now?'

1403
01:42:57,430 --> 01:43:02,680
She did not reply but stood thoughtfully looking
at him, seeming to have lost all her earlier

1404
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,060
confidence.

1405
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:08,640
She had not entered the room, but was still
standing in the half-light of the corridor.

1406
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,239
'What do you want?'

1407
01:43:11,239 --> 01:43:13,380
Marius repeated angrily.

1408
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:21,199
'M. Marius,' she said at last, a faint light
in her sad eyes, 'you seem upset.

1409
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:23,469
What's the matter?'

1410
01:43:23,469 --> 01:43:24,469
'Nothing.

1411
01:43:24,469 --> 01:43:26,300
Now please leave me alone.'

1412
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:30,969
Marius tried again to shut the door, but she
still held it open.

1413
01:43:30,969 --> 01:43:34,130
'You're making a mistake,' she said.

1414
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:38,640
'You aren't rich, but you were generous this
morning.

1415
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:43,740
You've been kind to us - now I want to be
kind to you.

1416
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:48,020
Is there anything that I can do?'

1417
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:52,090
Marius considered her offer, then had an idea.

1418
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:57,610
Moving closer to her, he said, 'Do you know
the address of those people who've just left

1419
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:59,580
your room?'

1420
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,140
'No.'

1421
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,800
'Can you find out for me?'

1422
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,800
'Is that what you want?'

1423
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,580
she said, a disappointed look on her face.

1424
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:11,040
'Yes.'

1425
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,040
The girl looked hard at him for a minute.

1426
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,670
'What will you give me?'

1427
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:18,320
she said at last.

1428
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,630
'Anything you want.'

1429
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,630
'Anything?'

1430
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:22,630
'Yes.'

1431
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:26,389
'Then I'll get it.'

1432
01:44:26,389 --> 01:44:30,270
She left immediately, closing the door behind
her.

1433
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:36,179
Marius sat down and buried his face in his
hands, too overcome by emotion to think clearly.

1434
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:39,540
But then he heard a loud voice from the next
room.

1435
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:42,449
'I tell you I'm sure.'

1436
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:44,490
Jondrette was speaking to his wife.

1437
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:47,590
'I recognized him.'

1438
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:51,640
Without another thought, Marius jumped on
to the cupboard and looked again through the

1439
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,949
hole in the wall.

1440
01:44:53,949 --> 01:44:55,580
'Really?'

1441
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,640
His wife looked puzzled.

1442
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,010
'Are you sure?'

1443
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,940
'Of course I'm sure.

1444
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:04,460
It's been eight years, but I recognized him
at once.'

1445
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:10,110
He told the two girls to leave the room and
then, when alone with his wife, he said, 'And

1446
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:12,290
I recognized the girl too.

1447
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:14,460
I'm surprised you didn't.'

1448
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,010
'Why should I?

1449
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,750
I've never seen her'

1450
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:23,080
But Jondrette bent down and whispered something
in her ear.

1451
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:27,699
Straightening up, he said, 'Now do you recognize
her?'

1452
01:45:27,699 --> 01:45:32,610
'Her?' said the woman, her voice filled with
sudden hatred.

1453
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:33,940
'Are you sure?

1454
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,459
That's impossible!'

1455
01:45:35,459 --> 01:45:36,459
she cried.

1456
01:45:36,459 --> 01:45:40,510
'Our daughters barefoot and without a dress
between them, while she wears leather boots

1457
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:41,830
and a fur coat?

1458
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:43,120
You must be wrong.

1459
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:47,440
You've forgotten, that child was ugly, and
this one's not bad-looking.'

1460
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,610
'I tell you, it's the same girl.

1461
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:51,619
You'll see.

1462
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:53,610
And I'll tell you another thing.

1463
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:56,010
She's going to make us a fortune.

1464
01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:58,230
I'm tired of being poor.

1465
01:45:58,230 --> 01:46:01,390
We deserve a better life, and this is our
chance.'

1466
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:03,659
'What do you mean?'

1467
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:08,000
'He said he'll be here at six o'clock, with
sixty francs.

1468
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,320
I'll bring some friends round, and we'll make
sure he gives us a lot more money.'

1469
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:19,160
'What will you do if he doesn't give you more
money?'

1470
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:21,620
Jondrette stroked his beard and laughed.

1471
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:25,160
'We'll know what to do about it.'

1472
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:30,060
And then, as he was going to leave the room,
he turned to his wife and said, 'You know,

1473
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,510
it's lucky he didn't recognize me.

1474
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:36,280
If he had, he wouldn't be coming back here
again.

1475
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:44,140
It's the beard that saved me - my lovely,
long, romantic beard!'

1476
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:51,619
With an ugly laugh, he pulled his cap down
over his eyes and left the room.

1477
01:46:51,619 --> 01:46:52,619
***

1478
01:46:52,619 --> 01:46:57,090
Although Marius was a dreamer and not a man
of action, he knew immediately that he had

1479
01:46:57,090 --> 01:47:02,989
to save M. Leblanc and 'Ursula' from the trap
that Jondrette was setting for them.

1480
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:04,889
But what could he do?

1481
01:47:04,889 --> 01:47:09,790
He could not warn M. Leblanc because he did
not know the old man's address.

1482
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,929
There was only one thing to do: he had to
tell the police.

1483
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:19,420
Half an hour later, Marius was at the nearest
police station.

1484
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:24,020
The desk clerk showed him into the police
chief's office, where a tall man with a wide

1485
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:29,290
face and a thin, tight mouth was trying to
keep warm next to a tire.

1486
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:32,389
'Are you the chief of police?'

1487
01:47:32,389 --> 01:47:33,470
Marius asked.

1488
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:36,560
'He's away,' the tall man said.

1489
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,389
'I'm Inspector Javert.

1490
01:47:38,389 --> 01:47:41,570
Now, what do you want?'

1491
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:45,230
Marius told Javert about the morning's events.

1492
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:51,480
When he told Javert his address, he noticed
the inspector's eyes light up with great interest.

1493
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:56,370
Then, when everything had been explained,
Javert thought for a moment.

1494
01:47:56,370 --> 01:48:03,179
Finally, he asked Marius for his door key
and told him to go home and hide quietly in

1495
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:07,739
his room so that his neighbours would think
he was out.

1496
01:48:07,739 --> 01:48:13,370
'Take these with you,' the inspector went
on, producing two small guns.

1497
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:19,100
'When the old man and the girl arrive, let
them start their business.

1498
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:23,700
When you think it's getting dangerous, shoot
one of these guns.

1499
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:27,780
After that, I'll take charge.'

1500
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:32,119
Back in his room, Marius sat down nervously
on his bed.

1501
01:48:32,119 --> 01:48:34,680
It was nearly six o'clock.

1502
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,590
Outside it had stopped snowing, and a full
moon was growing steadily brighter above the

1503
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:40,590
mist.

1504
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:43,600
Suddenly, he heard voices.

1505
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,420
Taking off his boots, he quietly climbed on
to the cupboard and looked through the hole

1506
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:49,710
in the wall.

1507
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:54,469
A fire burned in the corner of the room, filling
it with blood-red light.

1508
01:48:54,469 --> 01:49:00,770
Jondrette, who had just come in, was shaking
snow from his shoes.

1509
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:02,400
'Everything's arranged,' he said.

1510
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,790
'Has the concierge gone out?'

1511
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:06,790
'Yes,' his wife said.

1512
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,969
'And you're sure he's not in next door?'

1513
01:49:09,969 --> 01:49:10,969
'Positive.'

1514
01:49:10,969 --> 01:49:12,660
'Good.'

1515
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:14,460
Then he turned to his daughters.

1516
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:19,830
'Now, you two must go and keep guard in the
street, one by the gate, one at the street

1517
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:21,260
corner.'

1518
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:22,900
'A fine job!'

1519
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,880
the elder girl called back.

1520
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,320
'Keeping guard barefoot in the snow.'

1521
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:29,989
'Tomorrow you'll have fur boots!'

1522
01:49:29,989 --> 01:49:33,389
her father called out after her.

1523
01:49:33,389 --> 01:49:40,200
A few minutes later, there was nobody in the
building except for Marius and the Jondrettes.

1524
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:45,540
Marius watched as Jondrette put a metal bar
in the fire and inspected a rope ladder on

1525
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:46,750
the table.

1526
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:54,170
Next, he opened a drawer, took out a long
knife and tested its blade with his finger.

1527
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:59,949
Suddenly, at exactly six o'clock, the door
into the Jondrettes' room opened.

1528
01:49:59,949 --> 01:50:06,369
'Welcome, Monsieur, 'Jondrette said, rising
to his feet.

1529
01:50:06,369 --> 01:50:10,650
M. Leblanc appeared and put four coins on
the table.

1530
01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:15,409
'That is for your rent and food, Monsieur,'
he said.

1531
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:20,380
'Now we must discuss what else is needed.'

1532
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:25,929
Jondrette quietly told his wife to dismiss
the carriage, and when she had left the room,

1533
01:50:25,929 --> 01:50:27,540
turned back to his visitor.

1534
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,690
'How is the wounded child?'

1535
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,490
M. Leblanc asked him.

1536
01:50:33,490 --> 01:50:34,890
'Not well.'

1537
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:36,599
Jondrette smiled sadly.

1538
01:50:36,599 --> 01:50:38,080
'She's in great pain.

1539
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,650
Her sister has taken her to hospital, but
they'll be back soon.'

1540
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:47,719
The conversation continued politely in this
way for several minutes.

1541
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:54,599
M. Leblanc asked Jondrette about his circumstances,
and Jondrette smiled sadly as he invented

1542
01:50:54,599 --> 01:50:56,880
lie after lie.

1543
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,970
Finally, Jondrette picked up a large picture
that was leaning against the wall, and showed

1544
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:04,250
it to M. Leblanc.

1545
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:05,870
'What's that?'

1546
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:10,900
M. Leblanc said, looking at the badly-drawn
picture of a soldier in uniform.

1547
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:15,560
'It's a work of art,' Jondrette informed him.

1548
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,790
'I love this picture as much as I love my
two daughters.

1549
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:23,270
But, unfortunately, I have to sell it.

1550
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:26,560
What do you think it's worth?'

1551
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,520
'It's just an old inn-sign.

1552
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,680
It's worth about three francs.'

1553
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:37,829
'I'll accept a thousand,' Jondrette softly
replied.

1554
01:51:37,829 --> 01:51:44,770
M. Leblanc rose and, standing with his back
to the wall, looked quickly round the room.

1555
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:50,610
Jondrette was on his left, his wife was standing
on his right near the door.

1556
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:55,210
Jondrette put the picture down and stepped
quietly towards the old man.

1557
01:51:55,210 --> 01:52:02,579
'You don't recognize me, do you?' he said
in a loud, clear voice.

1558
01:52:02,579 --> 01:52:08,060
At this signal, which he had pre-arranged
with his friends, three men armed with metal

1559
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,540
poles rushed into the room.

1560
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:16,040
M. Leblanc grew pale, and gripped the back
of the broken chair with his huge hands.

1561
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:22,320
Marius, meanwhile, raised his right hand with
the gun, ready to fire the warning shot.

1562
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,400
'The carriage is ready?'

1563
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,670
Jondrette asked the three men.

1564
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:31,310
'Yes, with two good horses,' one of them replied.

1565
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:32,520
'Excellent.'

1566
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:37,060
He turned to M. Leblanc and repeated his earlier
question.

1567
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:40,150
'You still don't recognize me, do you?'

1568
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:41,199
'No.'

1569
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:45,400
'My name isn't Jondrette.

1570
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,500
It's Thenardier.

1571
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:50,060
Now do you recognize me?'

1572
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:54,090
M. Leblanc trembled slightly, but still shook
his head.

1573
01:52:54,090 --> 01:52:59,599
Marius, however, who had been going to fire
the gun as a signal for the police to arrive,

1574
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:03,510
shook so much that he almost fell off the
cupboard.

1575
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,780
'Thenardier,' he thought.

1576
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:10,860
'That's the name of the man who saved my father's
life at the Battle of Waterloo.

1577
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:14,030
The man I've promised to help!'

1578
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:21,199
If he fired the warning shot, M. Leblanc would
be saved and Thenardier would be destroyed.

1579
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:25,170
But he would also have broken his promise
to his father.

1580
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:27,040
He felt his knees grow weak.

1581
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,510
What should he do?

1582
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:33,369
Thenardier walked up and down in front of
M. Leblanc.

1583
01:53:33,369 --> 01:53:38,200
'Do you remember the little inn in Montfermeil
eight years ago?

1584
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:42,929
You took away our Cosette, do you remember?

1585
01:53:42,929 --> 01:53:47,010
Wearing that old yellow coat, pretending you
were a tramp!

1586
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:52,739
Well, now you're going to learn that you can't
make things right by just bringing a few hospital

1587
01:53:52,739 --> 01:53:53,739
blankets!

1588
01:53:53,739 --> 01:53:56,750
You're the cause of all my troubles.

1589
01:53:56,750 --> 01:54:02,619
For 1500 francs you took away a girl who was
bringing me lots of money.'

1590
01:54:02,619 --> 01:54:06,610
'I don't know what you're talking about,'
M. Leblanc said.

1591
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:09,410
'I don't know who you are, but I know what
you are.

1592
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,000
You're a dirty criminal.'

1593
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,389
'A criminal?'

1594
01:54:13,389 --> 01:54:16,469
Thenardier said, suddenly angry.

1595
01:54:16,469 --> 01:54:19,960
'That's what you rich people call people like
me, isn't it?

1596
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,830
Just because I've failed in business.

1597
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:26,790
I was a war hero, you know - I saved an officer's
life at Waterloo!

1598
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:28,390
And you call me a criminal!

1599
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:32,270
Well, I'm going to teach you a lesson.'

1600
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:36,760
He began to move towards M. Leblanc, but the
old man was too quick for him.

1601
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:42,650
With surprising speed, he pushed the table
and chair to one side and ran to the window.

1602
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:48,130
He managed to open it but, before he could
jump, the three men jumped on him and held

1603
01:54:48,130 --> 01:54:50,180
him to the floor.

1604
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,079
This was too much for Marius.

1605
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:57,849
'Forgive me, father,' he murmured, preparing
to fire the gun.

1606
01:54:57,849 --> 01:55:02,530
But suddenly Thenardier cried, 'Don't hurt
him!'

1607
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:07,850
After a long fight, M. Leblanc was tied up
and taken to the bed.

1608
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:09,580
'No wallet?'

1609
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:12,840
Thenardier cried, having searched his pockets.

1610
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,690
'Never mind.'

1611
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:21,170
He sat on the bed next to the helpless but
brave old man, and said, 'Let's discuss things

1612
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:22,170
quietly.

1613
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:27,590
All I'm asking for is 200,000 francs.

1614
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:34,599
I realize that you don't have the money with
you now, but I want you to write a letter.

1615
01:55:34,599 --> 01:55:37,650
I'll tell you what to say.'

1616
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:43,590
He untied M. Leblanc's right hand and, producing
a pen and paper, began:

1617
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:48,710
My dearest daughter, You must come at once.

1618
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:52,849
I need you urgently.

1619
01:55:52,849 --> 01:55:58,890
The person who gives you this note will bring
you to me.

1620
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:01,570
I shall be waiting.

1621
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:09,989
M. Leblanc signed his name Urbain Fabre, which
seemed to satisfy Thenardier, and wrote an

1622
01:56:09,989 --> 01:56:11,099
address on the envelope.

1623
01:56:11,099 --> 01:56:15,420
Thenardier then took the letter and gave it
to his wife.

1624
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:18,210
'There's a carriage outside.

1625
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:20,760
Don't be long.'

1626
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,810
Nearly half an hour passed.

1627
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:26,810
Thenardier seemed lost in his own dark thoughts.

1628
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:28,909
The prisoner did not move.

1629
01:56:28,909 --> 01:56:34,850
Finally, there was the sound of horses in
the street outside and, moments later, the

1630
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:37,829
door to the room was thrown open.

1631
01:56:37,829 --> 01:56:41,429
'It's a false address,' Mme Thenardier cried.

1632
01:56:41,429 --> 01:56:44,040
'There's no Urbain Fabre.

1633
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,940
The old man's been lying to us!'

1634
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:52,260
Thenardier sat on the corner of the table
in silence for some moments, swinging his

1635
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:56,889
leg and gazing with a fierce satisfaction
at the fire.

1636
01:56:56,889 --> 01:57:03,290
Then he turned to the prisoner and said in
a slow, threatening voice, 'What did you hope

1637
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:09,200
to gain by giving me a false name and address?'

1638
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,200
'Time!'

1639
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:15,449
cried the prisoner in a loud voice, jumping
from the bed, having secretly cut the ropes

1640
01:57:15,449 --> 01:57:17,470
that tied him.

1641
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:22,390
Before the others in the room could react,
M. Leblanc was standing by the fire, holding

1642
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:25,179
a metal bar above his head.

1643
01:57:25,179 --> 01:57:27,720
'I'm not afraid of you,' he said.

1644
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,969
'But neither should you fear me.'

1645
01:57:30,969 --> 01:57:35,400
With those words he threw the metal bar out
of the window into the street below.

1646
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:36,739
'Get him!'

1647
01:57:36,739 --> 01:57:38,090
Thenardier shouted.

1648
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:40,409
'He's defenceless.'

1649
01:57:40,409 --> 01:57:42,770
Two men grabbed him by the shoulders.

1650
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:46,010
'Now cut his throat!'

1651
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:47,639
Thenardier called.

1652
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:54,000
Marius stared, frozen with fear as Thenardier,
knife in hand, stood hesitating a few steps

1653
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,480
away from the prisoner.

1654
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:02,099
The brave man was in terrible danger, but
Marius still could not fire the gun.

1655
01:58:02,099 --> 01:58:07,239
Then, in the moonlight, he saw the solution
to his problem.

1656
01:58:07,239 --> 01:58:12,510
On top of the cupboard, by his feet, he noticed
the piece of paper that the elder daughter

1657
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:15,070
had written on: Be careful!

1658
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:17,350
The police are coming!

1659
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:20,219
He immediately saw what he had to do.

1660
01:58:20,219 --> 01:58:26,239
He took a piece of brick from the wall, wrapped
the piece of paper around it and threw it

1661
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:30,130
through the hole into the middle of Thenardier's
room.

1662
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,949
He was just in time.

1663
01:58:31,949 --> 01:58:38,929
Thenardier was advancing towards his prisoner,
knife in hand, when his wife cried, 'Something

1664
01:58:38,929 --> 01:58:39,929
fell!'

1665
01:58:39,929 --> 01:58:46,280
She picked up the piece of paper and handed
it to her husband, who read it quickly.

1666
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:50,590
'It's Eponine's handwriting!' he cried a moment
later.

1667
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,590
'Quick!

1668
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:52,590
Get the ladder.

1669
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:55,280
The police are coming and we've got to go!'

1670
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:01,139
They threw the rope ladder from the open window
but, before they could escape, the door opened

1671
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:03,160
and Inspector Javert walked in.

1672
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:06,520
'Relax,' he smiled.

1673
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,900
'You can't escape through the window.

1674
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:12,050
There are five of you, and fifteen of us.

1675
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:14,050
You have no chance.

1676
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:17,730
Why not come quietly?'

1677
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:22,179
The men put down their weapons and surrendered
without a fight.

1678
01:59:22,179 --> 01:59:27,350
When everybody had been arrested and taken
from the room, Javert noticed the prisoner,

1679
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:31,310
who was standing, head bowed, by the window.

1680
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:37,219
He turned to speak to another policeman but,
when he looked back, he saw that the prisoner

1681
01:59:37,219 --> 01:59:39,160
had gone.

1682
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:42,500
Javert rushed to the open window and looked
down.

1683
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:48,100
The rope ladder was swinging gently above
the empty street.

1684
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:54,740
'He must have been the cleverest of them all,
'Javert murmured angrily to himself.

1685
01:59:54,740 --> 01:59:56,369
CHAPTER EIGHT

1686
01:59:56,369 --> 02:00:00,770
Marius and Cosette

1687
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:06,470
Not wishing to give evidence against Thenardier
in court, Marius made immediate arrangements

1688
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:08,130
to leave his room.

1689
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:15,560
Early the following morning, he paid the concierge
his final rent and went to live with his friend,

1690
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:16,810
Enjolras.

1691
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:23,179
Inspector Javert looked for Marius everywhere,
but without success.

1692
02:00:23,179 --> 02:00:27,239
Two months later, Marius was deeply unhappy.

1693
02:00:27,239 --> 02:00:32,800
He sent money every Monday to Thenardier,
who was in prison, which meant that he had

1694
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,719
even less money for himself.

1695
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:40,619
But the main reason for his unhappiness was
that he was forced to live his life with no

1696
02:00:40,619 --> 02:00:44,579
hope of seeing 'Ursula'.

1697
02:00:44,579 --> 02:00:49,960
One afternoon he was sitting in a field, looking
down at a small river, when his dreams of

1698
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:55,090
'Ursula' were suddenly broken by the sound
of a familiar voice.

1699
02:00:55,090 --> 02:01:01,570
He looked up and recognized Eponine, Thenardiers
elder daughter.

1700
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:07,199
Still wearing the same rags, with the same
bold look in her eyes and the same rough voice,

1701
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:10,690
she had somehow become more beautiful.

1702
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:16,040
She stared at Marius with a look of pleasure
on her pale face, and for some moments seemed

1703
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,590
unable to speak.

1704
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:24,150
'So at last I've found you,' she finally said.

1705
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:27,300
'I've been looking for you everywhere.

1706
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:30,220
You aren't living in the same room any more?'

1707
02:01:30,220 --> 02:01:32,489
'No,' said Marius.

1708
02:01:32,489 --> 02:01:35,280
'Well, I can understand that.

1709
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,450
It's not nice, that sort of thing.

1710
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:41,750
But why are you wearing that dirty old hat?

1711
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:48,110
'When Marius gave no answer, she went on,
'And you've got a hole in your shirt.

1712
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:50,160
I'll mend it for you.

1713
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:54,719
A young man like you ought to be nicely dressed.'

1714
02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:00,670
Marius still said nothing, and after a moments
pause she said, 'You don't seem very glad

1715
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:06,300
to see me, but I could make you look happy
if I wanted to!'

1716
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:08,369
'How?' said Marius.

1717
02:02:08,369 --> 02:02:10,870
'What do you mean?'

1718
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:13,650
'You weren't so unfriendly last time.'

1719
02:02:13,650 --> 02:02:17,550
'I'm sorry, but what do you mean?'

1720
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:22,320
She bit her lip and hesitated, as if trying
to make up her mind about something.

1721
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:25,960
Finally, she said, 'I've got the address.'

1722
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:30,829
Marius's heart seemed to miss a beat.

1723
02:02:30,829 --> 02:02:31,829
'You mean

1724
02:02:31,829 --> 02:02:34,520
'The address you wanted me to find out.

1725
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,790
The young lady, you know...'

1726
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:40,139
Her voice sank into a sigh.

1727
02:02:40,139 --> 02:02:42,420
Marius jumped up and took her by the hand.

1728
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:46,909
'Let's go at once!' he cried, wild with excitement.

1729
02:02:46,909 --> 02:02:50,869
Then he suddenly frowned and seized Eponine
by the arm.

1730
02:02:50,869 --> 02:02:55,679
'But you must promise me,' he said, 'that
you'll never tell your father the address.'

1731
02:02:55,679 --> 02:03:02,940
'I promise,' the girl replied, staring at
Marius with amusement.

1732
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:08,030
They had only gone a few steps when Eponine
stopped and said, 'You remember you promised

1733
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:10,110
me something?'

1734
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:12,040
Marius felt in his pocket.

1735
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:17,619
All he had in the world was the five-franc
piece he intended to give her father in prison.

1736
02:03:17,619 --> 02:03:24,139
He pushed it into her hand, but she opened
her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground.

1737
02:03:24,139 --> 02:03:28,820
She looked at him with a mixture of disappointment
and sadness in her eyes.

1738
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:35,249
'I don't want your money,' she said.

1739
02:03:35,249 --> 02:03:36,249
***

1740
02:03:36,249 --> 02:03:40,110
That evening, Cosette was alone in the house
which Jean Valjean had bought about a year

1741
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:41,750
earlier.

1742
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:46,520
It was a small house in a back street, with
a large, wild garden.

1743
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:52,059
Valjean had gone away on business for a couple
of days, and Cosette was in the downstairs

1744
02:03:52,059 --> 02:03:54,710
sitting room, playing the piano.

1745
02:03:54,710 --> 02:03:59,889
Suddenly, she thought she heard the sound
of footsteps in the garden.

1746
02:03:59,889 --> 02:04:06,079
She listened at the window for a minute, then
ran up to her bedroom, opened the window and

1747
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,119
looked out.

1748
02:04:08,119 --> 02:04:12,989
The moonlit garden and the street beyond it
were completely empty.

1749
02:04:12,989 --> 02:04:21,050
Cosette, not a nervous girl by nature, smiled
to herself and thought no more about it.

1750
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:26,090
The next evening, as she was walking in the
garden, she was sure that she heard someone

1751
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:28,000
moving in the trees.

1752
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,960
Again, when she looked round, she saw nothing.

1753
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:38,550
When Jean Valjean returned from his business
the following day, Cosette told him about

1754
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:40,980
the noises in the garden.

1755
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:47,119
He told her not to worry, but she noticed
an anxious look in his eyes.

1756
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:52,329
He spent the next two nights walking around
the garden, checking the gate, listening for

1757
02:04:52,329 --> 02:04:57,510
noises, but nothing unusual happened.

1758
02:04:57,510 --> 02:05:03,679
Then one morning, a few days later, Cosette
noticed a large stone lying on the garden

1759
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,040
bench.

1760
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:11,350
Nervously, she picked it up and discovered
an envelope underneath it.

1761
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:18,290
Inside, there was a small notebook filled
with love poems.

1762
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:23,409
Cosette sat down and began to read, enjoying
the music of the language and the beauty of

1763
02:05:23,409 --> 02:05:25,420
the handwriting.

1764
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:31,239
She had never read anything like this before,
and it affected her deeply.

1765
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:39,489
Her heart on fire, she took the notebook upstairs
to her bedroom and read every word again.

1766
02:05:39,489 --> 02:05:45,580
She remembered the handsome young man she
had seen so often in the Luxembourg Gardens.

1767
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:51,699
As she read the notebook, she knew in her
heart that he was the author of these beautiful,

1768
02:05:51,699 --> 02:05:53,940
romantic words.

1769
02:05:53,940 --> 02:06:00,690
Finally, she kissed the book, held it to her
heart and waited for the evening, when she

1770
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:05,869
knew that something special was going to occur.

1771
02:06:05,869 --> 02:06:09,650
That evening, Jean Valjean went out.

1772
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:14,840
Cosette spent a long time in front of the
mirror, making her hair look beautiful and

1773
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,580
deciding which dress to wear.

1774
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:21,139
Finally, she went out into the garden.

1775
02:06:21,139 --> 02:06:27,570
She sat on the bench where she had found the
notebook and, moments later, had the strange

1776
02:06:27,570 --> 02:06:31,079
feeling that she was being watched.

1777
02:06:31,079 --> 02:06:35,270
She looked round and jumped to her feet.

1778
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:37,900
It was He!

1779
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:40,520
He looked paler and thinner than she remembered.

1780
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:45,559
His dark clothes were almost invisible in
the shadows, and his face shone softly in

1781
02:06:45,559 --> 02:06:48,210
the fading light.

1782
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:54,030
Cosette felt suddenly faint, but she did not
move or make a sound.

1783
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:58,230
'Forgive me for being here.'

1784
02:06:58,230 --> 02:07:00,309
Marius spoke at last.

1785
02:07:00,309 --> 02:07:02,960
'But I've been so unhappy.

1786
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,400
Do you recognize me?

1787
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,699
You mustn't be afraid.

1788
02:07:06,699 --> 02:07:12,849
It's a long time ago, but do you remember
the day when you first looked at me - in the

1789
02:07:12,849 --> 02:07:15,199
Luxembourg Gardens?

1790
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:18,260
And the day you walked past me?

1791
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:22,040
Those things happened nearly a year ago.

1792
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:28,460
Forgive me for talking like this, I don't
know what I'm saying - perhaps I'm annoying

1793
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:29,930
you?

1794
02:07:29,930 --> 02:07:35,619
But the truth is, I can't live without you.'

1795
02:07:35,619 --> 02:07:38,000
'Mother!'

1796
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,280
Cosette murmured, and began to fall.

1797
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:46,119
Marius caught her and held her tightly in
his arms without realizing what he was doing,

1798
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:49,020
lost in a mist of love.

1799
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:56,020
Cosette, feeling her body close to his, took
his hand and pressed it against her heart.

1800
02:07:56,020 --> 02:08:04,510
Aware of the shape of the notebook under her
dress, he said, 'So, you've read my notebook.

1801
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:06,800
Do you love me, too?'

1802
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,480
'Of course,' she answered in a low voice.

1803
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,840
'You know I do.'

1804
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:20,210
Then, as if by magic, her lips were next to
his and they were kissing.

1805
02:08:20,210 --> 02:08:26,059
Afterwards, they sat together on the garden
bench in a state of shock, neither of them

1806
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:27,820
speaking.

1807
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:32,389
Beneath the stars, they were happy just to
look into each others eyes and hold each other's

1808
02:08:32,389 --> 02:08:33,389
hands.

1809
02:08:33,389 --> 02:08:36,989
Then, at last, they began to speak.

1810
02:08:36,989 --> 02:08:41,739
They talked all evening about their dreams,
their mistakes, their moments of happiness,

1811
02:08:41,739 --> 02:08:44,639
their moments of despair.

1812
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:52,099
When everything had been said, she laid her
head on his shoulder and asked, 'What's your

1813
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:53,099
name?'

1814
02:08:53,099 --> 02:08:55,870
'My name's Marius.

1815
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:57,750
And yours?'

1816
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:59,370
'Cosette.'

1817
02:08:59,370 --> 02:09:07,679
During that month of May in the year 1832,
Cosette and Marius met every day in the wild

1818
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:11,290
garden of that small, secret house.

1819
02:09:11,290 --> 02:09:17,429
They would sit and hold hands and talk, or
just gaze into each other's eyes and smile.

1820
02:09:17,429 --> 02:09:22,349
'How lovely you are,' Marius would sigh.

1821
02:09:22,349 --> 02:09:25,770
'There are moments when I think this is a
dream.

1822
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:30,320
There are other moments when I think I'm a
little mad.

1823
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:32,960
I love you so much.'

1824
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:40,079
To which Cosette would reply, 'I love you
more with every minute that passes.'

1825
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:46,560
In this way, bathed in happiness, they lived
untroubled by the world.

1826
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,560
***

1827
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:54,880
One beautiful, starry evening, Marius found
Cosette sitting unhappily in her garden.

1828
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:59,700
'What's the matter?' he asked, sitting next
to her on the bench.

1829
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:05,429
'My father said that we may have to leave,'
she replied.

1830
02:10:05,429 --> 02:10:07,250
Marius trembled.

1831
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:11,190
For six weeks, he had known nothing but uncomplicated
happiness.

1832
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:17,630
Now, for the first time, there was a cloud
in the clear blue sky of his life.

1833
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:22,599
He could not speak, and Cosette felt his hand
grow cold.

1834
02:10:22,599 --> 02:10:27,790
She asked, as he had done, 'What's the matter?'

1835
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:34,310
He replied, in a voice so low that she could
hardly hear it, 'I don't understand what you

1836
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:35,310
mean.'

1837
02:10:35,310 --> 02:10:41,070
'Father told me this morning that I have to
pack everything and be ready to leave for

1838
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:44,780
England within a week.'

1839
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:53,290
Marius rose to his feet and said coldly, 'Cosette,
are you going?'

1840
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:57,110
She looked up at him, her pale face lined
with misery.

1841
02:10:57,110 --> 02:10:59,460
'What else can I do?'

1842
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:01,730
she cried.

1843
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:03,579
'So you're leaving me.'

1844
02:11:03,579 --> 02:11:09,369
'Oh, Marius, why are you being so cruel to
me?'

1845
02:11:09,369 --> 02:11:14,630
Marius turned his back to her and said, 'Then
I shall have to go away.'

1846
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:17,260
'No, Marius, wait.

1847
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:19,800
I've got an idea.'

1848
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,260
Marius turned and was surprised to see her
smiling.

1849
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:25,199
'What is it?'

1850
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:29,579
'If we go, you must come too.

1851
02:11:29,579 --> 02:11:34,300
I'll tell you where, and you must meet me
there, wherever it is.'

1852
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:37,130
'How can I possibly do that?' he cried.

1853
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:38,920
'Are you crazy?

1854
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:42,880
You need money to go to England, and I haven't
got any.

1855
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:45,760
I haven't told you, Cosette, but I'm a poor
man.

1856
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:52,900
I wear a cheap hat, my jacket has lost half
its buttons and there are holes in my boots.'

1857
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:57,889
He turned away from her and stood with his
face pressed to the trunk of a tree, almost

1858
02:11:57,889 --> 02:11:59,880
ready to faint.

1859
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,659
He stayed in that position for some time.

1860
02:12:02,659 --> 02:12:09,540
Finally, he heard a small sound behind him
and, turning round, he saw that Cosette was

1861
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:11,260
in tears.

1862
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:15,340
He fell on his knees in front of her and pressed
her hand to his lips.

1863
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:18,070
'Don't cry,' he said.

1864
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:21,219
'I cannot let you leave me.

1865
02:12:21,219 --> 02:12:25,050
I promise you that if you leave me, I shall
die.

1866
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:29,579
But listen to me - I have a plan.

1867
02:12:29,579 --> 02:12:31,139
Don't expect me here tomorrow.'

1868
02:12:31,139 --> 02:12:34,230
'Why not?'

1869
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:36,059
Cosette said, drying her tears.

1870
02:12:36,059 --> 02:12:38,739
'A whole day without seeing you!

1871
02:12:38,739 --> 02:12:40,429
That's unbearable!'

1872
02:12:40,429 --> 02:12:44,739
'It's worth losing a day together if we want
to be happy for the rest of our lives.'

1873
02:12:44,739 --> 02:12:47,990
'But what are you going to do?'

1874
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:51,510
'Wait until the day after tomorrow.

1875
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:52,989
I'll tell you then.

1876
02:12:52,989 --> 02:12:57,429
But until then, I must give you my address.

1877
02:12:57,429 --> 02:13:01,290
I'm living with a friend of mine, Enjolras.'

1878
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:07,910
Marius then took a knife out of his pocket
and scratched his address on the wall - 16,

1879
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:09,770
rue de la Verrerie.'

1880
02:13:09,770 --> 02:13:13,599
'Please, Marius,' Cosette said as she watched
him.

1881
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:17,070
'Where are you going tomorrow evening?

1882
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:20,290
I won't be able to sleep if you don't tell
me.'

1883
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:21,590
'I'm going to try something.'

1884
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:28,190
'Well, I'll pray for you to succeed and I'll
never stop thinking about you.

1885
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:33,690
I'll ask no more questions, but you must promise
to be here early the day after tomorrow.

1886
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,889
Not later than nine o'clock.'

1887
02:13:35,889 --> 02:13:40,579
'I promise,' Marius said.

1888
02:13:40,579 --> 02:13:41,579
CHAPTER NINE

1889
02:13:41,579 --> 02:13:44,080
Monsieur Gillenormand

1890
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:51,920
M. Gillenormand, Marius's grandfather, was
now ninety years old.

1891
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:59,170
He was unhappy about many things - about losing
his teeth, about the political situation but,

1892
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:04,429
most of all, about the fact that he had not
seen his grandson for four years, since their

1893
02:14:04,429 --> 02:14:06,540
big quarrel.

1894
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:12,449
Although he was too proud to admit he was
wrong, and although he was angry, M. Gillenormand

1895
02:14:12,449 --> 02:14:18,309
hoped that Marius, whom he still loved, would
return one day.

1896
02:14:18,309 --> 02:14:23,760
One evening in June, M. Gillenormand was sitting
in front of a large fire, staring into the

1897
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:27,250
flames and thinking bitterly of Marius.

1898
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:32,760
He was feeling depressed, because he realized
that he would probably never see his grandson

1899
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,760
again.

1900
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:39,540
While he was gazing into the fire, thinking
these sad thoughts, his old servant entered

1901
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:45,960
the room and asked, 'Will Monsieur receive
M. Marius?'

1902
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:52,900
For a moment all the blood seemed to leave
M. Gillenormand's face, and the servant began

1903
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:56,099
to worry that his master was ill.

1904
02:14:56,099 --> 02:15:04,960
But the old man finally raised his head and
said, in a low voice, 'Show him in.'

1905
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,800
Marius stood uncertainly in the doorway.

1906
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:13,440
The poor condition of his clothes could not
be seen in the half-darkness of the room.

1907
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:18,659
Nothing of him was clearly visible except
his face, which was calm and serious, but

1908
02:15:18,659 --> 02:15:20,280
strangely sad.

1909
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:25,860
M. Gillenormand stared at his grandson with
disbelief.

1910
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,719
At last!

1911
02:15:27,719 --> 02:15:29,840
After four years!

1912
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:31,949
Was it really him?

1913
02:15:31,949 --> 02:15:40,510
He wanted to open his arms and hug him, but
all he said was, 'What have you come for?'

1914
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:42,560
Marius murmured something in embarrassment.

1915
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:48,400
'I can't hear you,' the old man said, looking
annoyed.

1916
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:51,639
'Have you come to apologize?

1917
02:15:51,639 --> 02:15:55,409
Do you now see that you were wrong?'

1918
02:15:55,409 --> 02:15:58,099
'No, Monsieur.'

1919
02:15:58,099 --> 02:15:59,520
Marius lowered his eyes.

1920
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:04,829
'Well then,' the old man shouted, 'what do
you want?'

1921
02:16:04,829 --> 02:16:08,620
'Monsieur, I ask you to have pity on me.

1922
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:14,929
I know I'm not welcome here, but I have come
to ask for only one thing.

1923
02:16:14,929 --> 02:16:16,940
Then I'll go away at once.'

1924
02:16:16,940 --> 02:16:21,270
'You're a young fool,' the old man said.

1925
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:24,910
'Who said you had to go away?

1926
02:16:24,910 --> 02:16:28,590
You left me - your grandfather!

1927
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:33,280
- to join in those street protests against
the government, I suppose.

1928
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:40,410
You're probably in trouble with the police,
or you're in debt, and you've run back to

1929
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:42,069
me for help

1930
02:16:42,069 --> 02:16:44,840
'Monsieur, it's none of those things.'

1931
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:48,880
'Well, what is it exactly that you want?'

1932
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:54,240
'I have come to ask your permission to get
married.'

1933
02:16:54,240 --> 02:17:01,460
The old man paused for a moment before saying,
'So, you want to get married at the age of

1934
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:02,460
twenty-one.

1935
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:06,880
I suppose you've got some sort of career,
now?

1936
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:10,810
Perhaps you've made a fortune.

1937
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:13,250
What do you earn as a lawyer?'

1938
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:14,250
'Nothing.'

1939
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:21,120
'Well then, I imagine the lucky girl must
have money.'

1940
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,840
'She's no richer than I am.'

1941
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,420
'What does her father do?'

1942
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,389
'I don't know.'

1943
02:17:27,389 --> 02:17:31,240
M. Gillenormand turned away with disgust.

1944
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:33,819
'So that's it.

1945
02:17:33,819 --> 02:17:37,050
Twenty-one years old, no job, no money.

1946
02:17:37,050 --> 02:17:44,149
Your wife will have to count the sous when
she goes to the market, won't she?'

1947
02:17:44,149 --> 02:17:47,609
'I beg you, Monsieur,' Marius cried.

1948
02:17:47,609 --> 02:17:49,359
'I love her so much.

1949
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:52,660
Please allow me to marry her!'

1950
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:55,920
The old man gave a high, unpleasant laugh.

1951
02:17:55,920 --> 02:18:02,819
'So you said to yourself, "I'll have to go
and see him, that old fool.

1952
02:18:02,819 --> 02:18:07,210
He'll be so happy to see me that he won't
care who I marry.

1953
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:13,569
I haven't a pair of shoes, and she hasn't
a shirt, but never mind.

1954
02:18:13,569 --> 02:18:21,540
I'm going to throw away my youth, my career,
my whole life, and dive into poverty with

1955
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:23,530
a woman around my neck...

1956
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:26,290
" That's what you think, isn't it?

1957
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:31,450
Well, my boy, you can do whatever you want.

1958
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:35,380
But I will never give you my permission!

1959
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:36,870
Never!'

1960
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:38,350
'Grandfather

1961
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:39,840
'Never!'

1962
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:44,290
The tone of his grandfather's voice robbed
Marius of all hope.

1963
02:18:44,290 --> 02:18:48,350
He rose and crossed the room slowly, with
his head bowed.

1964
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:54,240
He had just reached the door, however, when
M. Gillenormand moved quickly towards him,

1965
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:57,690
pulled him back into the room and pushed him
into an armchair.

1966
02:18:57,690 --> 02:19:05,800
'Tell me about it,' he said to Marius, who
stared back with silent amazement, unaware

1967
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:12,040
that the word 'grandfather' was responsible
for the change in the old man's behaviour.

1968
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:17,290
'Come on, tell me about your love affairs.

1969
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:18,830
Don't be afraid to talk.

1970
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:22,740
Don't forget, I'm your grandfather.

1971
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:27,710
Here... ' he said, taking a purse from a drawer
and putting it on the table.

1972
02:19:27,710 --> 02:19:29,849
'Here's some money for you.

1973
02:19:29,849 --> 02:19:34,429
Buy yourself some new clothes.'

1974
02:19:34,429 --> 02:19:39,559
Marius told his grandfather all about Cosette
and how much he loved her.

1975
02:19:39,559 --> 02:19:45,090
M. Gillenormand listened carefully and, when
Marius had finished, he laughed.

1976
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:50,660
'You must enjoy yourself when you're young,'
he said.

1977
02:19:50,660 --> 02:19:54,431
'But you must also be sensible.

1978
02:19:54,431 --> 02:19:58,569
Don't get married yet, that's my advice.

1979
02:19:58,569 --> 02:20:03,149
Have fun with the girl, but don't marry her.

1980
02:20:03,149 --> 02:20:08,320
Make her your lover but not your wife.'

1981
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:14,720
Marius, too shocked to reply, shook his head
and rose to his feet.

1982
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:22,570
He then turned slowly to the old man, bowed
deeply and said, 'Four years ago you insulted

1983
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:24,280
my father.

1984
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:28,710
Today you have insulted my future wife.

1985
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:32,740
I shall ask no more favours of you, Monsieur.

1986
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:33,811
Goodbye.'

1987
02:20:33,811 --> 02:20:40,010
M. Gillenormand called for Marius to come
back, but it was too late.

1988
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:43,870
The proud young man had closed the door and
gone.

1989
02:20:43,870 --> 02:20:50,260
'Oh my God,' the old man cried, burying his
face in his hands.

1990
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:52,420
'What have I done?

1991
02:20:52,420 --> 02:20:54,740
This time he'll never come back.'

1992
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:57,270
***

1993
02:20:57,270 --> 02:21:02,570
Marius left his grandfathers house in a state
of despair, and returning to his room, fell

1994
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:06,350
asleep fully-dressed on the bed.

1995
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:11,359
When he woke up, Enjolras was in the room
with a few other friends.

1996
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:15,170
They all looked very nervous and excited about
something.

1997
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:17,910
'What's the matter?'

1998
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:18,910
Marius asked sleepily

1999
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:24,000
'Are you coming to the funeral of General
Lamarque?'

2000
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,520
'Who's he?'

2001
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:33,070
Enjolras and his friends shook their heads
with amazement at their friend's lack of awareness,

2002
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:36,290
and soon left the room.

2003
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:42,230
Marius opened a drawer and took out the two
guns which Inspector Javert had lent him in

2004
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:43,230
February.

2005
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:47,830
Putting them in his jacket pocket, he went
out and continued to wander aimlessly around

2006
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:53,729
the streets, noticing only occasionally the
strange atmosphere of excitement that was

2007
02:21:53,729 --> 02:21:56,200
growing in the town.

2008
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:02,351
People were running around, and there was
a lot of noise, but Marius paid little attention.

2009
02:22:02,351 --> 02:22:08,290
He could think of only one thing: his meeting
later that evening with Cosette.

2010
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:16,859
This would be his last brief happiness; after
that, there would be only darkness.

2011
02:22:16,859 --> 02:22:22,320
At nine o'clock that evening, Marius crept
into the garden of Cosette's house, but she

2012
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:26,271
was not there waiting for him as she had promised.

2013
02:22:26,271 --> 02:22:31,400
Looking up, he saw that there were no lights
on in the house and that all the windows were

2014
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:32,950
closed.

2015
02:22:32,950 --> 02:22:37,460
Unable to control himself, he beat his fists
against the walls of the house.

2016
02:22:37,460 --> 02:22:40,710
'Cosette!' he cried, not caring who heard
him.

2017
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:43,130
'Where are you?'

2018
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:50,450
He called her name again and again until,
exhausted, he sat down on the stone steps.

2019
02:22:50,450 --> 02:22:55,540
Now she was gone, he told himself, he had
no future.

2020
02:22:55,540 --> 02:23:00,620
There was nothing for him to do except die.

2021
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:05,420
Suddenly he heard a voice calling through
the trees from the street.

2022
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:07,520
'M. Marius!'

2023
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:09,640
He looked up.

2024
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:11,640
'Who's that?'

2025
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,450
'Is that you, M. Marius?'

2026
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:16,450
'Yes.'

2027
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:23,640
'Your friends are waiting for you at the barricade
in the rue de Chanvrerie.'

2028
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:30,140
Marius ran to the gate and was just in time
to see the figure of Eponine, Thenardier's

2029
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:37,120
daughter, disappearing into the shadows at
the end of the street.

2030
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:38,779
CHAPTER TEN

2031
02:23:38,779 --> 02:23:42,310
The Barricade

2032
02:23:42,310 --> 02:23:47,399
In the spring of 1832, the people of Paris
were ready for revolution.

2033
02:23:47,399 --> 02:23:56,330
Charles X, who had become king in 1824, believed
that he had total power over the French people.

2034
02:23:56,330 --> 02:24:01,569
He was a strong supporter of the Catholic
church and the aristocracy, and he took away

2035
02:24:01,569 --> 02:24:06,870
the freedoms that Napoleon had given the ordinary
citizens.

2036
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:12,279
Although this made him very unpopular, he
thought that his opponents would be too weak

2037
02:24:12,279 --> 02:24:15,399
to prevent him from doing what he wanted.

2038
02:24:15,399 --> 02:24:17,340
He was wrong.

2039
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:23,690
In 1830, there was a peaceful revolution,
and he was forced to leave.

2040
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:30,460
The new king, Louis-Philippe, was a brave
and clever man who loved his country.

2041
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:35,540
The ordinary people liked him at first, but
he soon showed that he was more interested

2042
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:40,590
in power for his family than democracy for
his people.

2043
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:46,610
He understood business, but he could not understand
the problems of poor people.

2044
02:24:46,610 --> 02:24:52,650
Neither could he understand the concept of
freedom of speech, and he often sent soldiers

2045
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:58,740
into the streets to attack people who were
making public protests.

2046
02:24:58,740 --> 02:25:05,300
As the summer approached, the mood of the
workers and the poor became angrier and angrier.

2047
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:14,000
Their anger exploded into violence in June
1832, when General Lamarque died.

2048
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,521
The General had been very popular with the
people of France because of his love for Napoleon.

2049
02:25:20,521 --> 02:25:26,980
The day of his funeral was arranged for 5
June, and thousands of people saw this as

2050
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:32,021
a chance to make a public protest against
the king and his government.

2051
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:36,510
At first, the funeral went quietly.

2052
02:25:36,510 --> 02:25:40,870
Soldiers accompanied the coffin as it was
carried slowly across Paris.

2053
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:47,850
A large crowd followed behind, waving flags
and carrying swords and heavy sticks.

2054
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:53,830
The crowd grew more and more excited, until
finally they tried to take the coffin away

2055
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:57,090
from the soldiers and carry it across a bridge.

2056
02:25:57,090 --> 02:26:02,080
Their exit was blocked by more soldiers on
horseback.

2057
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:04,240
For a moment, nothing happened.

2058
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:07,690
Then there were two gunshots.

2059
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:13,350
The first shot killed the commander of the
soldiers guarding the exit to the bridge.

2060
02:26:13,350 --> 02:26:18,860
The second killed a deaf old woman who was
trying to shut her window.

2061
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:22,180
Then the fighting started.

2062
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:27,410
Soldiers attacked the crowd with swords; the
crowd threw stones and ran screaming across

2063
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:29,200
the bridge.

2064
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:37,140
Minutes later, the sounds of war echoed across
the whole city of Paris.

2065
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:38,140
***

2066
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:42,340
As soon as the fighting started, Enjolras
and several of his friends started to build

2067
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:49,580
a barricade outside the Corinth wine shop
in the rue de la Chanvrerie, a small street

2068
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:54,460
surrounded by dark alleys in the market district
of Paris.

2069
02:26:54,460 --> 02:27:00,240
Enjolras had been joined by many strangers
as he and his friends had run shouting along

2070
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:02,070
the street.

2071
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:08,870
There was a tall, grey-haired man whom nobody
knew, but whose strong, brave face had impressed

2072
02:27:08,870 --> 02:27:09,910
everybody.

2073
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:16,070
There were several street children, excited
by the sound of battle, who also joined them.

2074
02:27:16,070 --> 02:27:21,770
One of these children was Eponine, who had
dressed like a boy so that no one would tell

2075
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:24,380
her to go home.

2076
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:29,240
Having run to tell Marius that his friends
were waiting for him, she was helping Enjolras

2077
02:27:29,240 --> 02:27:33,350
and his companions to build the barricade.

2078
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:38,120
New people arrived all the time, bringing
with them gunpowder and weapons to fight the

2079
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:41,650
soldiers who would be arriving very soon.

2080
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:47,240
Enjolras, who was the leader of the rebels,
organized the building of a second barricade

2081
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:51,810
and the manufacture of bullets from melted
silver.

2082
02:27:51,810 --> 02:27:57,510
The tall, grey-haired man was doing useful
work on the larger barricade, and Eponine

2083
02:27:57,510 --> 02:28:02,320
(whom everyone thought was a boy) worked hard
too.

2084
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:07,641
The barricades were finished in less than
an hour and, with the sound of drums in the

2085
02:28:07,641 --> 02:28:13,980
city growing louder, Enjolras brought a table
out into the street and sat down with his

2086
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:16,450
friends for a drink.

2087
02:28:16,450 --> 02:28:19,641
Night fell, but nothing happened.

2088
02:28:19,641 --> 02:28:24,870
While the fifty men behind the barricade waited
impatiently for the arrival of sixty thousand

2089
02:28:24,870 --> 02:28:29,920
soldiers, Enjolras approached the tall, grey-haired
man.

2090
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:34,040
'Who are you?' he asked.

2091
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:38,230
When the man said nothing, Enjolras became
suspicious.

2092
02:28:38,230 --> 02:28:42,790
'You're a policeman, aren't you?' he said.

2093
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:47,090
The man smiled and eventually admitted that
he was.

2094
02:28:47,090 --> 02:28:52,540
'My name's Javert,' he said.

2095
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:57,710
Before he could move, Enjolras ordered four
men to search him.

2096
02:28:57,710 --> 02:29:02,660
When they found a letter in his pocket which
proved that he had been sent to spy on them,

2097
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:07,660
they tied him to a post inside the inn,

2098
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:16,170
'You'll be shot two minutes before the barricade
falls,' Enjolras informed him.

2099
02:29:16,170 --> 02:29:17,170
***

2100
02:29:17,170 --> 02:29:22,062
Marius left the garden and, mad with grief
at losing Cosette, walked towards the sound

2101
02:29:22,062 --> 02:29:25,790
of drums and gunfire in the centre of the
city.

2102
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:31,279
He had only one thought in his mind: he wanted
to die.

2103
02:29:31,279 --> 02:29:35,351
Marius pushed his way through the crowds of
frightened, murmuring people that filled the

2104
02:29:35,351 --> 02:29:38,710
streets until he reached the market area.

2105
02:29:38,710 --> 02:29:44,260
Here, he found the unlit streets suddenly
filled with soldiers.

2106
02:29:44,260 --> 02:29:50,510
Unafraid, Marius ran through the shadows,
ignoring shouts for him to stop.

2107
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:57,370
Someone fired a gun and a bullet hit a wall
just behind him, but he didn't care.

2108
02:29:57,370 --> 02:30:02,970
He was just approaching the rue de Chanvrerie
when he heard a loud voice calling from the

2109
02:30:02,970 --> 02:30:06,830
shadows: 'Who's there?'

2110
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:16,990
'The French Revolution!' he heard a distant
voice reply - the voice of his friend, Enjolras.

2111
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:21,150
Marius stood behind an alley wall, hidden
in the shadows.

2112
02:30:21,150 --> 02:30:26,540
Around the corner, he could see a row of soldiers
aiming their guns down the rue de Chanvrerie,

2113
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:28,090
waiting for the order to fire.

2114
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:29,090
'Fire!'

2115
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:32,330
the order finally came.

2116
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:37,470
The street was lit with a sudden flash of
light and filled with the thunder of gunfire.

2117
02:30:37,470 --> 02:30:41,410
Then the soldiers attacked.

2118
02:30:41,410 --> 02:30:46,280
Marius stood up and ran along a series of
alleys that led into the rue de la Chanvrerie,

2119
02:30:46,280 --> 02:30:49,370
behind the Corinth wine shop.

2120
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:54,260
When he reached the stronghold, soldiers were
already climbing the barricade, shooting at

2121
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:55,870
the rebels.

2122
02:30:55,870 --> 02:31:02,120
Marius saw a soldier attacking Enjolras, who
had fallen backwards and was calling for help.

2123
02:31:02,120 --> 02:31:08,870
Marius took Javert's guns from his pockets
and shot the soldier dead.

2124
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:13,450
Soldiers now occupied the top of the barricade,
but were unable to advance any further because

2125
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:15,760
the defenders fought so fiercely.

2126
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:21,620
Marius, who had thrown away his guns and was
now without a weapon, began to move towards

2127
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:26,521
a barrel of gunpowder he had seen near the
door of the wine shop.

2128
02:31:26,521 --> 02:31:30,660
He did not notice a soldier aiming his gun
at him.

2129
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:36,950
Neither did he see, at the moment the soldier
fired, a young boy dressed in rags jump in

2130
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:43,740
front of the gun and fall wounded as the bullet
meant for Marius hit him in the hand.

2131
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:46,870
'Put down your weapons and surrender!'

2132
02:31:46,870 --> 02:31:49,630
a soldier called from the top of the barricade.

2133
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:50,689
'Fire!'

2134
02:31:50,689 --> 02:31:52,820
Enjolras shouted.

2135
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:57,510
The soldiers and the rebels fired at each
other at the same time, filling the air with

2136
02:31:57,510 --> 02:32:00,220
thick clouds of dark smoke.

2137
02:32:00,220 --> 02:32:05,181
When the smoke cleared, there were many dead
bodies on both sides.

2138
02:32:05,181 --> 02:32:12,069
The survivors were reloading their guns in
silence, when suddenly a loud voice called,

2139
02:32:12,069 --> 02:32:17,710
'Get out now, or I'll blow up the barricade!'

2140
02:32:17,710 --> 02:32:22,030
All heads turned to stare in the direction
of the voice.

2141
02:32:22,030 --> 02:32:26,720
Marius was standing at the foot of the barricade,
holding a flaming torch above a barrel of

2142
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:27,720
gunpowder.

2143
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:36,420
'If you blow up the barricade,' a sergeant
called, 'you'll blow up yourself as well!'

2144
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:41,300
Marius smiled and lowered the torch towards
the gunpowder.

2145
02:32:41,300 --> 02:32:46,050
Within seconds, the soldiers had left the
barricade, leaving their dead and wounded

2146
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:50,720
behind, and were running into the darkness
at the far end of the street.

2147
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:54,790
Enjolras threw his arms around Marius's neck.

2148
02:32:54,790 --> 02:32:58,080
'So you've come!' he cried.

2149
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:04,160
Marius hugged Enjolras and many other friends
he recognized.

2150
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:08,750
While the soldiers waited at the far end of
the street for further orders, and the rebels

2151
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:14,359
removed dead bodies from the barricade and
took care of the wounded, Marius walked around

2152
02:33:14,359 --> 02:33:17,870
the stronghold in a kind of dream.

2153
02:33:17,870 --> 02:33:23,420
After two months of happiness with Cosette,
he was now in the middle of a war.

2154
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:26,689
He could not believe this was happening to
him.

2155
02:33:26,689 --> 02:33:33,150
He was so confused that he did not recognize
Javert, tied to a post inside the inn throughout

2156
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:35,220
the battle.

2157
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:40,550
As he was walking by the smaller barricade,
his thoughts were interrupted by a weak voice

2158
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:43,330
calling his name from the shadows.

2159
02:33:43,330 --> 02:33:46,439
'M. Marius!'

2160
02:33:46,439 --> 02:33:51,870
He looked about him but, seeing no one, he
started to walk away, thinking that he was

2161
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:54,120
imagining things.

2162
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:56,840
'M. Marius!'

2163
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:59,470
He heard the voice again.

2164
02:33:59,470 --> 02:34:02,740
Marius gazed into the shadows, but could still
see nothing.

2165
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:08,760
'I'm at your feet,' the voice said.

2166
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:14,960
Looking down, Marius saw a dark shape crawling
along the ground towards him.

2167
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:20,630
By the light of a lamp on the pavement, he
could see a torn jacket, trousers with holes

2168
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:24,660
in them, and two bare feet.

2169
02:34:24,660 --> 02:34:32,080
A white face was turned towards him and the
voice asked, 'Do you recognize me?

2170
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:34,930
It's Eponine.'

2171
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:40,100
Marius bent down quickly, and saw that it
was indeed that unhappy girl, dressed in a

2172
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:41,100
man's clothes.

2173
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:45,080
'What are you doing here?' he said.

2174
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:50,510
Then, noticing the pool of blood on the ground
behind her, cried, 'You're wounded!

2175
02:34:50,510 --> 02:34:52,149
I'll carry you to the inn.

2176
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:54,229
They'll take care of you there.

2177
02:34:54,229 --> 02:34:56,439
Is it very bad?'

2178
02:34:56,439 --> 02:34:59,819
She showed him the bullet hole in her hand.

2179
02:34:59,819 --> 02:35:07,600
'A soldier was going to shoot you,' she said,
her voice no more than a whisper.

2180
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:12,290
'But I put my hand in front of his gun.'

2181
02:35:12,290 --> 02:35:16,070
'You poor child,' Marius said.

2182
02:35:16,070 --> 02:35:19,320
'We'll put a bandage on that wound immediately.

2183
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:20,320
You'll be all right.'

2184
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:32,279
'The bullet passed through my hand,' Eponine
murmured, 'but it came out through my back.

2185
02:35:32,279 --> 02:35:40,220
It's no use trying to move me, but I'll tell
you how you can treat my wound better than

2186
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:42,820
any doctor.

2187
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:48,689
Sit down on that stone, close beside me.'

2188
02:35:48,689 --> 02:35:50,410
Marius sat next to her.

2189
02:35:50,410 --> 02:35:58,240
She rested her head on his knee and said without
looking at him, 'Oh, what happiness.

2190
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:02,450
Now I don't feel any pain,'

2191
02:36:02,450 --> 02:36:04,649
For a moment she was silent.

2192
02:36:04,649 --> 02:36:09,900
She pressed her hand to her chest, from which
blood was pouring like dark wine.

2193
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:15,600
Then, with a great effort, she raised herself
on one arm and, struggling for breath, looked

2194
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,850
into Marius's eyes.

2195
02:36:17,850 --> 02:36:22,811
'I can't cheat you,' she said at last.

2196
02:36:22,811 --> 02:36:27,200
'I have a letter for you in my pocket.

2197
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,450
I've had it since yesterday.

2198
02:36:30,450 --> 02:36:34,090
I was asked to post it, but I didn't.

2199
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:37,240
I didn't want you to get it.

2200
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:43,189
But now we're both going to die, it doesn't
matter, does it?

2201
02:36:43,189 --> 02:36:47,420
I can't be jealous any more.

2202
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:50,860
Take your letter.'

2203
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:56,590
She took hold of Marius's hand with her wounded
hand and, without seeming to feel the pain,

2204
02:36:56,590 --> 02:37:01,590
guided it to her pocket, from which he took
the letter.

2205
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:08,470
'Now you must promise me something for my
trouble,' she said.

2206
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:15,279
'You must kiss me on the forehead after I'm
dead...

2207
02:37:15,279 --> 02:37:16,760
I shall know.'

2208
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:21,000
She let her head fall back on his knees.

2209
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,550
Her eyelids trembled, and then she was still.

2210
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:32,300
Just as Marius thought that her sad soul had
finally left her body, she slowly opened her

2211
02:37:32,300 --> 02:37:39,450
eyes, and said in a voice so sweet that it
seemed already to come from another world,

2212
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:49,080
'You know, M. Marius, I think I was a little
bit in love with you.'

2213
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:56,240
With those words, she closed her eyes for
the last time and died.

2214
02:37:56,240 --> 02:38:02,540
Marius kissed her pale forehead and laid her
gently on the ground.

2215
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:08,330
Then he returned to the wine shop, and opened
the letter that she had given him.

2216
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:11,080
By candlelight he read,

2217
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:16,580
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2218
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:25,460
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme,
and in a week we shall be in England.

2219
02:38:25,460 --> 02:38:30,910
Cosette, 4 June.

2220
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:34,250
Marius covered Cosette's letter with kisses.

2221
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:36,740
So she still loved him!

2222
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:44,080
He thought for a moment that now he must not
die, but then he thought, 'She's going away.'

2223
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:48,480
She was going with her father to England,
and his grandfather had refused to give his

2224
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:51,050
permission for him to marry.

2225
02:38:51,050 --> 02:38:57,420
Nothing had changed, and he decided that he
had one last duty to perform: he must send

2226
02:38:57,420 --> 02:39:02,080
Cosette a final message and tell her of his
death.

2227
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:06,670
He tore a page out of the pocket notebook
he always carried and wrote:

2228
02:39:06,670 --> 02:39:10,410
Our marriage was impossible.

2229
02:39:10,410 --> 02:39:15,580
I went to my grandfather, and he refused to
give his permission.

2230
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:19,550
I have no money, and neither have you.

2231
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:23,990
I hurried to see you, but you had gone.

2232
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:27,120
You remember the promise I made you.

2233
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:29,250
I shall keep it.

2234
02:39:29,250 --> 02:39:30,780
I shall die.

2235
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:33,979
I love you.

2236
02:39:33,979 --> 02:39:41,630
When you read this, my soul will be very near
and smiling at you.

2237
02:39:41,630 --> 02:39:46,520
He folded the letter, wrote Cosette's new
address on the back and called over a young

2238
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:47,750
boy.

2239
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:52,120
'What's your name?' he asked the boy.

2240
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:53,420
'Gavroche.'

2241
02:39:53,420 --> 02:39:58,560
'Well, Gavroche, will you do something for
me?

2242
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:04,521
I want you to deliver this letter to the address
written on the outside.'

2243
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:10,550
The boy scratched his head, thought for a
moment, and then, with a sudden movement,

2244
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:14,300
took the letter and ran off into the night.

2245
02:40:14,300 --> 02:40:16,700
CHAPTER ELEVEN

2246
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:17,700
The Letter

2247
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:26,660
Jean Valjean, at that moment, was in a state
of terrible shock.

2248
02:40:26,660 --> 02:40:31,529
For the first time in their life together,
he and Cosette had quarrelled.

2249
02:40:31,529 --> 02:40:37,330
She had not wanted to leave the house, but
she had eventually obeyed him.

2250
02:40:37,330 --> 02:40:42,960
They had left quickly, at nightfall, bringing
their servant, Toussaint, with them, but very

2251
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:45,290
little luggage.

2252
02:40:45,290 --> 02:40:50,630
Cosette had brought her letter case and blotter
with her, Valjean his box of child's clothing

2253
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:55,950
and the old National Guard uniform which all
respectable men possessed, and which he had

2254
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:58,160
worn under a previous identity.

2255
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:02,601
In their new house, they went to bed in silence.

2256
02:41:02,601 --> 02:41:08,760
Cosette, however, did not leave her bedroom
the next day, and Jean Valjean had dinner

2257
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:10,430
alone.

2258
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:15,340
As he was eating, Toussaint told him about
the fighting in the city, but he did not pay

2259
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:16,971
much attention.

2260
02:41:16,971 --> 02:41:19,860
He was too worried about Cosette.

2261
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:24,630
There was no reason, he thought, why they
should not continue to live happily together

2262
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:25,630
in England.

2263
02:41:25,630 --> 02:41:32,020
As long as he had Cosette, he would be happy,
and it did not matter where they lived.

2264
02:41:32,020 --> 02:41:36,980
He began to feel happier as he thought about
the journey they would soon be making.

2265
02:41:36,980 --> 02:41:42,979
He stood up and was going to leave the room
when something made him stop.

2266
02:41:42,979 --> 02:41:45,990
He glanced again at the mirror.

2267
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:51,649
Cosette's blotter was lying on a cupboard
just below it and, as Valjean stared at its

2268
02:41:51,649 --> 02:41:56,080
reflection, he read the following lines:

2269
02:41:56,080 --> 02:42:00,330
My dearest, We are leaving this house at once.

2270
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:08,021
We go tonight to Number 7, rue de 1'Homme-Arme,
and in a week we shall be in England.

2271
02:42:08,021 --> 02:42:11,660
Cosette, 4June.

2272
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:16,880
In her unhappy state of mind, Cosette had
forgotten to remove the page that she had

2273
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:20,630
used to blot the letter she had written to
Marius.

2274
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:27,090
She had left it on the cupboard and the mirror,
reflecting the backwards handwriting, made

2275
02:42:27,090 --> 02:42:31,460
the message clearly visible.

2276
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:38,391
Valjean moved closer to the mirror and read
the lines again, not wanting to believe them.

2277
02:42:38,391 --> 02:42:42,870
But there was no doubt that this was Cosette's
handwriting.

2278
02:42:42,870 --> 02:42:49,300
He began to shake and he fell back into an
armchair, feeling angry and betrayed.

2279
02:42:49,300 --> 02:42:55,830
He had suffered terribly over the years and,
until now, he had survived every disaster.

2280
02:42:55,830 --> 02:43:01,290
But this was the worst thing that had ever
happened to him - someone was threatening

2281
02:43:01,290 --> 02:43:06,070
to rob him of the only person he loved!

2282
02:43:06,070 --> 02:43:13,899
He murmured to himself, 'She's going to leave
me,' and the pain of those words cut into

2283
02:43:13,899 --> 02:43:17,250
his heart like a knife.

2284
02:43:17,250 --> 02:43:21,460
After a short time, he rose to his feet and
looked again at the blotter.

2285
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:28,910
His anger and misery of minutes before had
been replaced by a terrible calmness.

2286
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:33,630
He stared at the blotter, coldness in his
eyes, the darkness of the deepest night in

2287
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:34,780
his heart.

2288
02:43:34,780 --> 02:43:39,910
He remembered clearly the young man in the
Luxembourg Gardens who had shown such great

2289
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:47,150
interest in Cosette, and he was certain that
this was the man she had written to.

2290
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:51,729
He went out into the night and sat on the
doorstep, his heart filled with a terrible

2291
02:43:51,729 --> 02:43:57,170
hatred for the man who was trying to steal
Cosette from him.

2292
02:43:57,170 --> 02:44:03,061
He sat for a long time listening to the sound
of distant gunfire in the city, wondering

2293
02:44:03,061 --> 02:44:08,920
how to get his revenge, when suddenly he heard
footsteps.

2294
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:15,180
Looking up, he saw a pale-faced boy, dressed
in rags, studying the numbers of the houses

2295
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:17,960
in the street.

2296
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:25,050
Seeing Valjean on his doorstep, the boy stopped
and asked, 'Do you live in this street?'

2297
02:44:25,050 --> 02:44:26,620
'Yes.

2298
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:28,190
Why?'

2299
02:44:28,190 --> 02:44:30,229
'I'm looking for Number Seven.

2300
02:44:30,229 --> 02:44:32,890
I have a letter for a girl who lives here.'

2301
02:44:32,890 --> 02:44:35,910
'Well, I'm the girl's father.

2302
02:44:35,910 --> 02:44:37,800
You can give the letter to me.

2303
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:44,680
Oh, and one more thing before you go,'Valjean
said when the boy had handed him the letter.

2304
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:47,970
'Where should I take the reply?'

2305
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:54,971
'That letter comes from the barricade in the
rue de la Chanvrerie,' the boy replied.

2306
02:44:54,971 --> 02:44:57,870
'Which is where I'm going now.

2307
02:44:57,870 --> 02:44:58,870
Goodnight citizen.'

2308
02:44:58,870 --> 02:45:05,200
Jean Valjean went back into the house and
tried to make sense of the words that danced

2309
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:10,220
before his eyes: I shall die...

2310
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:15,970
When you read this, my soul will be very near...

2311
02:45:15,970 --> 02:45:20,370
This was enough to fill his hate-filled heart
with sudden joy.

2312
02:45:20,370 --> 02:45:22,880
So, the problem was solved!

2313
02:45:22,880 --> 02:45:29,700
The man who threatened his happiness was going
to die - was perhaps already dead.

2314
02:45:29,700 --> 02:45:38,280
Then Valjean frowned and, after a quick calculation,
decided that Marius was probably still alive.

2315
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:40,120
But it made no difference.

2316
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:45,790
He was still certain to die, and Valjean's
happiness would be safe.

2317
02:45:45,790 --> 02:45:50,540
If he kept the letter in his pocket, Cosette
would never know what had happened to the

2318
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:56,470
other man, and life with her would continue
the same as before.

2319
02:45:56,470 --> 02:45:58,740
What happiness!

2320
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:05,721
But his happiness had no sooner returned than
it disappeared again in a cloud of despair.

2321
02:46:05,721 --> 02:46:08,960
In his heart he knew he had no choice.

2322
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:13,399
For the sake of Cosette's happiness, he would
have to try and save the life of the man she

2323
02:46:13,399 --> 02:46:18,060
loved - the man he hated more than any other
in the world.

2324
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:25,601
Half an hour later he left the house, dressed
in his National Guard uniform, with a loaded

2325
02:46:25,601 --> 02:46:35,120
gun and a pocket full of gunpowder, and made
his way towards the market district of Paris.

2326
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:36,920
CHAPTER TWELVE

2327
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:38,170
Fight to the Death

2328
02:46:38,170 --> 02:46:45,561
During the night, the thirty-seven remaining
rebels strengthened the main barricade and

2329
02:46:45,561 --> 02:46:47,700
made more bullets.

2330
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:52,160
The ground floor of the wine shop became a
hospital for the wounded, and the bodies of

2331
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:56,010
the dead were taken to an alley near the smaller
of the two barricades.

2332
02:46:56,010 --> 02:47:03,410
Four of the dead people were National Guards,
and their uniforms were removed.

2333
02:47:03,410 --> 02:47:08,210
After a long discussion with his friends,
Enjolras decided that the married men (there

2334
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:11,200
were five of them) had to leave.

2335
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:14,450
'It's your duty not to die,' he told them.

2336
02:47:14,450 --> 02:47:15,960
'You must return to your families.'

2337
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:18,120
'How can we leave?'

2338
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:19,149
they protested.

2339
02:47:19,149 --> 02:47:20,170
'We're surrounded.

2340
02:47:20,170 --> 02:47:23,930
The soldiers will shoot us as soon as they
see us.'

2341
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:25,510
'You can wear these.'

2342
02:47:25,510 --> 02:47:31,430
Enjolras pointed to the National Guard uniforms
that had been taken off the dead soldiers.

2343
02:47:31,430 --> 02:47:35,810
'But there are only four,' Marius observed.

2344
02:47:35,810 --> 02:47:41,450
'Then one of us must stay and fight,' one
of the married men replied.

2345
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:46,170
A long argument followed, during which each
of the married men tried to persuade the others

2346
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:47,670
to go.

2347
02:47:47,670 --> 02:47:54,540
Finally, someone shouted to Marius, 'You decide
which one must stay.'

2348
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:59,440
Marius went pale at the thought of having
to choose which man had to die.

2349
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:08,149
He stared down at the four uniforms but, as
he did so, a fifth uniform fell as if by magic

2350
02:48:08,149 --> 02:48:10,680
at his feet.

2351
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:15,040
Looking round, Marius recognized Cosette's
father.

2352
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:20,910
Jean Valjean, who had arrived unnoticed at
the barricade, had been listening to the argument

2353
02:48:20,910 --> 02:48:24,540
and had quickly understood the situation.

2354
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:29,061
'Now you can all leave,' he said.

2355
02:48:29,061 --> 02:48:34,950
The sky grew lighter, but not a door or window
was open in the street.

2356
02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:39,330
The barricade was stronger than it had been
for the first assault, and the rebels were

2357
02:48:39,330 --> 02:48:43,490
at their positions, guns loaded and ready
for action.

2358
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:46,510
They did not have long to wait.

2359
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:51,170
Sounds of chains and of heavy wheels moving
along the stone streets could be heard, and

2360
02:48:51,170 --> 02:48:57,040
then soldiers came into view at the end of
the street, pulling a large cannon.

2361
02:48:57,040 --> 02:49:03,250
The rebels fired their guns but, when the
smoke had cleared, they saw the soldiers,

2362
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:08,290
unharmed, steadily aiming the cannon at the
barricade.

2363
02:49:08,290 --> 02:49:13,300
Moments later, an officer shouted a command
and the cannon roared into action.

2364
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:18,420
The cannonball crashed into the bottom of
the barricade with a loud explosion, but did

2365
02:49:18,420 --> 02:49:20,080
little damage.

2366
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:23,530
The rebels clapped and cheered.

2367
02:49:23,530 --> 02:49:28,489
More soldiers moved into position at the end
of the street, behind the cannon, and started

2368
02:49:28,489 --> 02:49:32,970
to build a low wall with pieces of broken
stone.

2369
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:38,540
At the same time, the leader of the gun crew
adjusted the aim of the cannon.

2370
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:40,610
'Heads down!'

2371
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:42,670
Enjolras shouted.

2372
02:49:42,670 --> 02:49:48,380
The next cannonball exploded against the wall
at one end of the barricade, killing two men

2373
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:49,840
and wounding three.

2374
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:54,640
'We mustn't let that happen again,' Enjolras
said.

2375
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:59,970
He aimed his gun over the barricade at the
leader of the gun crew, and fired.

2376
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:06,140
The gunner - a fair-haired, handsome young
man - spun round twice with his head thrown

2377
02:50:06,140 --> 02:50:09,410
back, and fell sideways across the cannon.

2378
02:50:09,410 --> 02:50:12,830
Blood poured from the middle of his back.

2379
02:50:12,830 --> 02:50:16,310
A tear rolled down Enjolras's cheek.

2380
02:50:16,310 --> 02:50:21,450
'It's sad,' he murmured to Marius, who was
standing next to him.

2381
02:50:21,450 --> 02:50:25,470
'He looked a brave young man.'

2382
02:50:25,470 --> 02:50:26,470
***

2383
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:31,210
The battle continued for some time; the cannon
destroyed the upper windows of the wine shop,

2384
02:50:31,210 --> 02:50:36,130
and did some damage to the barricade, but
the rebels did not withdraw.

2385
02:50:36,130 --> 02:50:40,439
They fired back at the soldiers, killing many
men.

2386
02:50:40,439 --> 02:50:44,779
In the pauses between shooting, the rebels
could hear the sound of fighting in other

2387
02:50:44,779 --> 02:50:46,850
parts of Paris.

2388
02:50:46,850 --> 02:50:53,450
They were filled with hope that help would
come soon, but the hope did not last long.

2389
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:58,910
Within half an hour the sound of gunfire in
other places had stopped, and the rebels knew

2390
02:50:58,910 --> 02:51:01,029
that they were alone.

2391
02:51:01,029 --> 02:51:06,080
When a second cannon was moved into position
next to the first, they knew that the end

2392
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:08,130
was near.

2393
02:51:08,130 --> 02:51:13,350
Both cannons fired together, accompanied by
gunfire from soldiers at the end of the street

2394
02:51:13,350 --> 02:51:15,640
and on the rooftops.

2395
02:51:15,640 --> 02:51:21,540
As other guns began firing at the smaller
barricade, the rebels fought back bravely,

2396
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:24,220
but they were running out of bullets.

2397
02:51:24,220 --> 02:51:29,090
There were only twenty-six men left, and the
main attack on the barricade was going to

2398
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:31,940
take place very soon.

2399
02:51:31,940 --> 02:51:37,470
Some men, including Marius, stayed on the
main barricade, while the others built a low

2400
02:51:37,470 --> 02:51:40,989
stone wall around the door of the wine shop.

2401
02:51:40,989 --> 02:51:47,641
Enjolras, inside the wine shop, turned to
Javert, who was still tied to the post.

2402
02:51:47,641 --> 02:51:52,740
'I haven't forgotten you,' he said, putting
a loaded gun on the table.

2403
02:51:52,740 --> 02:51:57,050
'The last man to leave this place will blow
your brains out.'

2404
02:51:57,050 --> 02:52:02,250
At this point, Jean Valjean spoke to Enjolras.

2405
02:52:02,250 --> 02:52:05,460
'You're the leader, aren't you?

2406
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:08,450
Can I ask you for a favour?'

2407
02:52:08,450 --> 02:52:11,110
'You saved a man's life by giving him your
uniform.

2408
02:52:11,110 --> 02:52:13,050
You deserve some reward.

2409
02:52:13,050 --> 02:52:14,850
What do you want?'

2410
02:52:14,850 --> 02:52:17,610
'Let me kill this man.'

2411
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:22,740
'That's fair,' Enjolras decided, when nobody
objected.

2412
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:24,380
'You can have your spy.'

2413
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:32,210
At the same moment there was the sound of
a drum, followed by a loud roar.

2414
02:52:32,210 --> 02:52:34,090
'They're coming!'

2415
02:52:34,090 --> 02:52:37,010
cried Marius from the top of the barricade.

2416
02:52:37,010 --> 02:52:42,540
The rebels rushed to their positions, leaving
Valjean alone with Javert inside the wine

2417
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:44,850
shop.

2418
02:52:44,850 --> 02:52:50,540
Valjean untied the rope around Javert's feet
and, taking him by the belt of his coat, led

2419
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:53,069
him outside.

2420
02:52:53,069 --> 02:52:58,990
Only Marius, looking over his shoulder, saw
them cross the stronghold towards the smaller

2421
02:52:58,990 --> 02:53:00,160
barricade.

2422
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:06,680
Valjean, his gun in one hand, pulled Javert
behind him over the barricade and into a narrow

2423
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:10,110
alley, where the corner of a house hid them
from view.

2424
02:53:10,110 --> 02:53:16,350
A terrible heap of dead bodies lay not far
away, among them the blood-stained body of

2425
02:53:16,350 --> 02:53:20,150
a young girl in man's clothes - Eponine.

2426
02:53:20,150 --> 02:53:27,069
Javert glanced at the dead body and murmured,
'I think I know that girl.

2427
02:53:27,069 --> 02:53:35,689
'Then, returning his attention to Valjean,
he said calmly, 'I think you know me, too.

2428
02:53:35,689 --> 02:53:36,689
Take your revenge.'

2429
02:53:36,689 --> 02:53:45,180
Valjean, however, took a knife from his pocket
and cut the ropes that tied Javert's wrists.

2430
02:53:45,180 --> 02:53:49,200
'You're free to go,' he said.

2431
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:56,050
When Javert stared at him, speechless with
surprise, Valjean went on, I don't suppose

2432
02:53:56,050 --> 02:53:58,130
I'll leave here alive.

2433
02:53:58,130 --> 02:54:03,200
But if I do, I'm staying at Number 7, rue
de l'Homme-Arme.

2434
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:05,690
Now go.'

2435
02:54:05,690 --> 02:54:10,790
Javert buttoned his coat, straightened his
shoulders and, with a puzzled look on his

2436
02:54:10,790 --> 02:54:15,510
face, began to walk off in the direction of
the market.

2437
02:54:15,510 --> 02:54:20,130
He had only gone a few steps, however, when
he turned and looked at Valjean.

2438
02:54:20,130 --> 02:54:24,340
'I find this embarrassing,' he said.

2439
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:28,480
'I'd rather you killed me.'

2440
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:33,609
'Go away,' Valjean replied.

2441
02:54:33,609 --> 02:54:39,830
Javert walked away slowly and Valjean, waiting
for him to turn a corner, fired his gun into

2442
02:54:39,830 --> 02:54:44,500
the air and returned to the stronghold.

2443
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:48,949
'It's done,' he said.

2444
02:54:48,949 --> 02:54:49,949
***

2445
02:54:49,949 --> 02:54:54,490
There was a roar of gunfire and the soldiers
attacked, rushing towards the barricade.

2446
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:57,880
Many fell, but many more reached the barricade.

2447
02:54:57,880 --> 02:55:02,970
The first assault was beaten back by the brave
rebels, but the soldiers attacked again and

2448
02:55:02,970 --> 02:55:03,970
again.

2449
02:55:03,970 --> 02:55:09,330
Soon, the ground below the barricade was piled
with dead and wounded men as the rebels and

2450
02:55:09,330 --> 02:55:12,410
soldiers fought hand to hand.

2451
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:17,970
The rebels fought long and hard to defend
the stronghold, but finally they had to withdraw

2452
02:55:17,970 --> 02:55:21,979
to the low wall outside the wine shop.

2453
02:55:21,979 --> 02:55:26,640
They stood with their backs to the door, shooting
up at the soldiers who were climbing down

2454
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:29,851
towards them from the barricade.

2455
02:55:29,851 --> 02:55:36,670
One by one the remaining rebels escaped into
the wine shop, until only Enjolras and Marius

2456
02:55:36,670 --> 02:55:39,060
were left outside.

2457
02:55:39,060 --> 02:55:44,560
As the two friends moved back towards the
door, fighting off the soldiers, a bullet

2458
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:47,330
hit Marius in the shoulder.

2459
02:55:47,330 --> 02:55:53,210
His eyes closed and, in great pain, he felt
a hand grab him as he fell.

2460
02:55:53,210 --> 02:55:59,100
'They've taken me prisoner,' he thought, moments
before losing consciousness.

2461
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:03,000
'Now I shall be shot.'

2462
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,760
The soldiers, meanwhile, attacked the wine
shop.

2463
02:56:06,760 --> 02:56:09,779
Before long, they broke down the door and
rushed inside.

2464
02:56:09,779 --> 02:56:15,899
Enjolras and the few surviving rebels fought
bravely, but the soldiers were too strong.

2465
02:56:15,899 --> 02:56:22,720
Soon, all the rebels were dead, including
Enjolras, who was the last to die.

2466
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:27,870
Sword in hand, surrounded by soldiers, he
refused to surrender.

2467
02:56:27,870 --> 02:56:35,160
He died in a rain of bullets with a strangely
victorious smile on his lips.

2468
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:37,439
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

2469
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:42,069
The Sewers of Paris

2470
02:56:42,069 --> 02:56:47,040
Marius had indeed been taken prisoner, but
not by the soldiers.

2471
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:52,010
It was Jean Valjean's hand that had caught
him as he fell.

2472
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:54,600
Valjean had taken no part in the battle.

2473
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:59,811
He had been looking after wounded men while
bullets flew all around him.

2474
02:56:59,811 --> 02:57:05,550
When Marius had been hit, Valjean ran to him
at once, grabbed him before he fell and carried

2475
02:57:05,550 --> 02:57:10,090
his unconscious body into a small alley behind
the wine shop.

2476
02:57:10,090 --> 02:57:16,080
Valjean lowered Marius to the ground, stood
with his back to the wall and looked around

2477
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:17,600
him.

2478
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:19,450
The situation was terrible.

2479
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:21,950
There seemed to be no escape.

2480
02:57:21,950 --> 02:57:24,540
On one side of him was the field of battle.

2481
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:30,170
On the other side was the low barricade, behind
which hundreds of soldiers waited for rebels

2482
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:31,590
trying to escape.

2483
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:35,160
Both ways meant certain death.

2484
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:39,290
It was a situation that only a bird could
have escaped from.

2485
02:57:39,290 --> 02:57:46,380
Valjean looked desperately around him, at
the house opposite, the barricade, the ground.

2486
02:57:46,380 --> 02:57:50,080
And then he had a sudden idea!

2487
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:56,000
At the foot of the smaller barricade, half-hidden
by broken stones and pieces of wood, there

2488
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:00,880
was a hole in the road covered with an iron
grille.

2489
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:08,800
Valjean leapt forward and, using all his strength,
he moved the stones and wood, opened the grille,

2490
02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:15,220
lifted Marius on to his shoulders and climbed
down into the darkness.

2491
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:21,939
A few minutes later, he found himself in a
long underground passage, a place of absolute

2492
02:58:21,939 --> 02:58:24,420
peace and silence.

2493
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:27,890
He was inside the Paris sewers.

2494
02:58:27,890 --> 02:58:32,960
He could just see, by the grey light from
the grille above his head, that he was surrounded

2495
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:34,271
by walls.

2496
02:58:34,271 --> 02:58:39,790
Ahead of him lay total darkness, but he had
to go on.

2497
02:58:39,790 --> 02:58:44,489
The soldiers might discover the grille by
the barricade at any moment, and come down

2498
02:58:44,489 --> 02:58:47,200
in search of him.

2499
02:58:47,200 --> 02:58:52,810
With Marius lying across his shoulders, Valjean
walked forward into the darkness, feeling

2500
02:58:52,810 --> 02:58:57,120
his way along the wet, slippery walls with
his hands.

2501
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:02,850
He moved from one passage into another, slipping
several times on the wet floor.

2502
02:59:02,850 --> 02:59:08,070
He could not see where he was going, but he
knew he had to follow the downward slope of

2503
02:59:08,070 --> 02:59:11,270
the passages towards the river.

2504
02:59:11,270 --> 02:59:16,910
He walked blindly downwards in this way for
a long time, his clothes wet with the blood

2505
02:59:16,910 --> 02:59:23,510
from Marius's wound, the faint whisper of
the young man's breath in his ear.

2506
02:59:23,510 --> 02:59:29,840
He walked in total darkness, the silence broken
occasionally by the thunder of gun carriages

2507
02:59:29,840 --> 02:59:35,040
and horses racing along the streets of Paris
far above his head.

2508
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:41,061
Suddenly, he saw his own shadow on the floor
of the passage in front of him.

2509
02:59:41,061 --> 02:59:45,529
Looking back, he saw the distant light of
a torch.

2510
02:59:45,529 --> 02:59:48,120
He was being followed!

2511
02:59:48,120 --> 02:59:52,950
He pressed himself against the wall, held
his breath and waited.

2512
02:59:52,950 --> 02:59:58,489
In the distance, a group of men formed a circle
around the torchlight.

2513
02:59:58,489 --> 03:00:03,430
They seemed to be listening for something,
waiting for someone to move.

2514
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:09,640
Finally, the group of men moved off along
another passage, and Valjean was left in total

2515
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:12,670
darkness once again.

2516
03:00:12,670 --> 03:00:16,540
He continued his journey through the sewers.

2517
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:21,830
Sometimes the roof of the passages was so
low that he had to bend down as he walked.

2518
03:00:21,830 --> 03:00:27,609
His feet slipped all the time in the water
on the ground, and he felt sick and faint

2519
03:00:27,609 --> 03:00:31,120
with the terrible, airless smell.

2520
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:37,170
At last, exhausted, he stopped beneath a large
grille that brought him much-needed light

2521
03:00:37,170 --> 03:00:39,561
and fresh air.

2522
03:00:39,561 --> 03:00:45,380
He laid Marius down gently at the edge of
the sewer, and looked down at his face.

2523
03:00:45,380 --> 03:00:50,100
It was covered with blood and as pale as death.

2524
03:00:50,100 --> 03:00:55,450
Valjean tore pieces oft his own shirt and
bandaged Marius's wounded shoulder as well

2525
03:00:55,450 --> 03:00:56,729
as he could.

2526
03:00:56,729 --> 03:01:05,450
Then, bending over the unconscious body, Valjean
stared at Marius with hatred in his eyes.

2527
03:01:05,450 --> 03:01:13,189
He found two objects in Marius's clothing:
a piece of bread and a wallet.

2528
03:01:13,189 --> 03:01:21,080
Valjean ate the bread and, opening the wallet,
found a note which Marius had written:

2529
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:24,279
My name is Marius Pontmercy.

2530
03:01:24,279 --> 03:01:32,940
My body must be taken to the house of my grandfather,
M. Gillenormand, 6 rue des Filles-du- Calvaire,

2531
03:01:32,940 --> 03:01:36,120
in the Marais.

2532
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:41,200
Valjean repeated the address until he could
remember it, returned the wallet to Marius's

2533
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:49,150
pocket, picked Marius up again and continued
his journey downwards towards the river.

2534
03:01:49,150 --> 03:01:55,260
He did not know what part of the city he was
passing under or how far he had come.

2535
03:01:55,260 --> 03:02:00,300
The only thing he was sure of was that the
light through the grilles far above his head

2536
03:02:00,300 --> 03:02:05,420
was growing weaker, which meant that the sun
was setting.

2537
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:11,170
At one point he had to walk waist-deep through
water, and almost sank as the ground turned

2538
03:02:11,170 --> 03:02:13,490
to sand beneath his feet.

2539
03:02:13,490 --> 03:02:19,450
Finally, when even his great strength was
beginning to fade, he saw ahead of him a light

2540
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:22,840
- the clear light of day.

2541
03:02:22,840 --> 03:02:27,770
He was suddenly filled with new energy at
the sight, at last, of his way of escape from

2542
03:02:27,770 --> 03:02:29,680
the sewers.

2543
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:35,450
Forgetting the weight of Marius on his shoulders
and his own hunger and tiredness, he ran towards

2544
03:02:35,450 --> 03:02:37,000
the light.

2545
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:43,090
He had to bend as the roof of the tunnel became
lower, but when he reached the light, Valjean

2546
03:02:43,090 --> 03:02:46,530
stopped and gave a cry of despair.

2547
03:02:46,530 --> 03:02:54,020
The opening was closed with a strong iron
gate, held firm by a huge, rusty lock.

2548
03:02:54,020 --> 03:03:00,720
Through the bars, Valjean could see daylight,
the river, a narrow riverbank - but how could

2549
03:03:00,720 --> 03:03:03,350
he get out?

2550
03:03:03,350 --> 03:03:07,660
Valjean laid Marius down by the wall, where
the floor was dry.

2551
03:03:07,660 --> 03:03:13,029
Then, moving to the gate, he shook it fiercely
with both hands, trying to bend the bars with

2552
03:03:13,029 --> 03:03:15,250
the last of his strength.

2553
03:03:15,250 --> 03:03:19,900
But the gate was solid and the bars were firm.

2554
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:25,040
Valjean turned his back to the gate and sank
to the ground, his head bowed between his

2555
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,670
knees.

2556
03:03:26,670 --> 03:03:35,920
There was no way out and, as all hope of escape
left him, he began to think of Cosette.

2557
03:03:35,920 --> 03:03:36,920
***

2558
03:03:36,920 --> 03:03:41,660
While in this state of despair, Valjean felt
a hand on his shoulder.

2559
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:43,800
He thought he was dreaming.

2560
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:50,130
He looked up and saw a man dressed in old
clothes standing beside him.

2561
03:03:50,130 --> 03:03:55,930
Despite the unexpectedness of this meeting,
Valjean recognized the man at once.

2562
03:03:55,930 --> 03:03:58,899
It was Thenardier.

2563
03:03:58,899 --> 03:04:04,189
Valjean did not show that he recognized the
man, and saw with relief that Thenardier had

2564
03:04:04,189 --> 03:04:06,430
not recognized him.

2565
03:04:06,430 --> 03:04:10,440
'I'll make a bargain with you,' the man said.

2566
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:12,350
'What do you mean?'

2567
03:04:12,350 --> 03:04:16,650
Thenardier nodded in Marius's direction.

2568
03:04:16,650 --> 03:04:18,950
'You've killed a man.

2569
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:25,779
Give me half of what you found in this man's
pockets, and I'll unlock the gate for you.'

2570
03:04:25,779 --> 03:04:29,880
He produced a large key from his pocket, and
a piece of rope.

2571
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:33,010
'I'll give you this as well,' he said.

2572
03:04:33,010 --> 03:04:39,760
'Then you can tie stones to the body and throw
it in the river.'

2573
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:42,260
Valjean took the rope without speaking.

2574
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:47,819
'What about my share of the money?'Thenardier
asked.

2575
03:04:47,819 --> 03:04:53,320
Valjean took thirty francs from his pockets
and showed it to Thenardier, who stared with

2576
03:04:53,320 --> 03:04:54,320
disbelief.

2577
03:04:54,320 --> 03:04:57,780
'You killed a man for just thirty francs?

2578
03:04:57,780 --> 03:05:00,409
You're a fool.'

2579
03:05:00,409 --> 03:05:05,080
He searched Marius's pockets himself, and
then Valjean's.

2580
03:05:05,080 --> 03:05:07,860
'It's true,' he said at last.

2581
03:05:07,860 --> 03:05:09,960
'That's all there is.

2582
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:11,010
Oh well.

2583
03:05:11,010 --> 03:05:14,580
Never say that I'm not a kind man.'

2584
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:20,479
He took the thirty francs and, helping Valjean
to lift Marius on to his shoulders, he put

2585
03:05:20,479 --> 03:05:27,490
the key in the lock and opened the gate just
wide enough for Valjean to pass through.

2586
03:05:27,490 --> 03:05:33,591
When Valjean was outside, Thenardier closed
the gate behind him and disappeared, like

2587
03:05:33,591 --> 03:05:38,869
a rat, into the darkness of the sewers.

2588
03:05:38,869 --> 03:05:39,869
***

2589
03:05:39,869 --> 03:05:44,570
Valjean laid Marius gently on the grass and
stood up, surrounded by silence, enjoying

2590
03:05:44,570 --> 03:05:47,600
the feeling of fresh air on his face.

2591
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:54,050
Then, just as he was bending to splash water
from the river on Marius's face, he was aware

2592
03:05:54,050 --> 03:05:57,420
of someone else standing behind him.

2593
03:05:57,420 --> 03:06:04,120
He looked round quickly and saw a tall man
in a long coat, a large stick in his hand.

2594
03:06:04,120 --> 03:06:11,400
Although the man's face was hidden in shadow,
Valjean recognized him as Inspector Javert.

2595
03:06:11,400 --> 03:06:16,250
Javert, however, did not recognize Valjean
at first.

2596
03:06:16,250 --> 03:06:20,950
He had been more interested in catching Thenardier,
who had escaped from prison and was known

2597
03:06:20,950 --> 03:06:23,050
to be in the area.

2598
03:06:23,050 --> 03:06:27,210
'Who are you?' he asked.

2599
03:06:27,210 --> 03:06:33,080
Valjean told him his name and stood, without
moving, as Javert approached and stared into

2600
03:06:33,080 --> 03:06:34,859
his eyes.

2601
03:06:34,859 --> 03:06:39,080
'Inspector Javert,' Valjean said quietly.

2602
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:42,260
'I beg you to do me one favour.

2603
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:46,239
I promise not to try and escape.

2604
03:06:46,239 --> 03:06:51,330
I gave you my address this morning, if you
remember, so you would know where to find

2605
03:06:51,330 --> 03:06:53,660
me anyway.'

2606
03:06:53,660 --> 03:06:56,109
Javert did not seem to hear.

2607
03:06:56,109 --> 03:07:01,601
He stared into Valjean's eyes for a long time,
then, stepping back with a look of confusion

2608
03:07:01,601 --> 03:07:07,300
in his eyes, asked dreamily, 'What are you
doing here?

2609
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:10,181
Who is this man?'

2610
03:07:10,181 --> 03:07:14,200
'Will you help me to take him home?'

2611
03:07:14,200 --> 03:07:15,240
Valjean said.

2612
03:07:15,240 --> 03:07:18,319
'He's badly injured.'

2613
03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:21,780
Javert looked unhappy, but he did not refuse.

2614
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:27,340
Bending down, he took a handkerchief from
his pocket, wet it in the river and bathed

2615
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:30,040
Marius's blood-stained forehead.

2616
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:33,729
Then he felt Marius's wrist.

2617
03:07:33,729 --> 03:07:35,989
'He's dead,' he said.

2618
03:07:35,989 --> 03:07:42,340
'No, not yet,' Valjean replied, feeling in
Marius's jacket for the wallet.

2619
03:07:42,340 --> 03:07:47,490
'Look,' he said, showing Javert the note with
Marius's grandfather's address.

2620
03:07:47,490 --> 03:07:51,229
'That's where we need to take him.'

2621
03:07:51,229 --> 03:07:55,439
Javert shouted to the driver who was waiting
for him to bring his carriage close to the

2622
03:07:55,439 --> 03:07:56,630
river.

2623
03:07:56,630 --> 03:08:01,779
With Marius in the back seat, Valjean and
Javert side by side in the front, the carriage

2624
03:08:01,779 --> 03:08:08,931
drove off quickly through the dark and strangely
empty streets of Paris.

2625
03:08:08,931 --> 03:08:14,140
When they arrived at M. Gillenormand's house,
a servant answered the door.

2626
03:08:14,140 --> 03:08:17,351
'Does M. Gillenormand live here?'

2627
03:08:17,351 --> 03:08:18,590
Javert asked.

2628
03:08:18,590 --> 03:08:19,830
'Yes.

2629
03:08:19,830 --> 03:08:21,240
What do you want?'

2630
03:08:21,240 --> 03:08:23,931
'We're bringing back his grandson.

2631
03:08:23,931 --> 03:08:25,391
He's dead.

2632
03:08:25,391 --> 03:08:26,840
Go and wake his grandfather.

2633
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:28,430
We're bringing him in.'

2634
03:08:28,430 --> 03:08:35,380
Javert, Valjean and the driver carried Marius
into the house and laid him gently on a sofa

2635
03:08:35,380 --> 03:08:38,689
in M. Gillenormand's sitting-room.

2636
03:08:38,689 --> 03:08:44,710
While one servant ran to find a doctor and
another looked for clean sheets, Valjean felt

2637
03:08:44,710 --> 03:08:47,630
Javert's hand on his arm.

2638
03:08:47,630 --> 03:08:53,020
He understood, and went downstairs with Javert
close behind him.

2639
03:08:53,020 --> 03:08:59,550
When they had got back into the carriage,
however, Valjean said, 'Inspector, will you

2640
03:08:59,550 --> 03:09:03,540
do one last thing for me before you arrest
me?'

2641
03:09:03,540 --> 03:09:05,700
'What is it?

2642
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:08,710
'Javert replied impatiently.

2643
03:09:08,710 --> 03:09:11,520
'Let me go home for a minute.

2644
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:16,340
After that, you can do whatever you want with
me.'

2645
03:09:16,340 --> 03:09:21,890
Javert was silent for some moments, his chin
sunk in the collar of his overcoat.

2646
03:09:21,890 --> 03:09:24,439
Then he pulled down the window in front of
him.

2647
03:09:24,439 --> 03:09:31,149
'Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme,' he told the
driver.

2648
03:09:31,149 --> 03:09:33,650
Neither man spoke during the journey.

2649
03:09:33,650 --> 03:09:38,770
At the end of the rue de l'Homme-Arme, which
was too narrow for the carriage to enter,

2650
03:09:38,770 --> 03:09:44,489
Javert paid the driver and accompanied Valjean
to his front door on foot.

2651
03:09:44,489 --> 03:09:50,620
'Go in,' said Javert, with a strange, distant
look in his eyes.

2652
03:09:50,620 --> 03:09:52,840
'I'll wait for you here.'

2653
03:09:52,840 --> 03:09:57,729
Valjean went into his house and called, 'It's
me!'

2654
03:09:57,729 --> 03:10:03,330
Climbing the stairs, he paused for a moment
to look out of the window to see what Javert

2655
03:10:03,330 --> 03:10:05,540
was doing.

2656
03:10:05,540 --> 03:10:10,870
But the street was empty; there was no one
there.

2657
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:17,910
The next morning, Inspector Javert's body
was discovered floating in the river.

2658
03:10:17,910 --> 03:10:23,689
The poor man, unable to understand the kindness
and gentle nature of the man he had spent

2659
03:10:23,689 --> 03:10:30,900
his whole life hating, had taken his own life
by jumping from a bridge.

2660
03:10:30,900 --> 03:10:39,840
It was the only way he knew to escape the
confusion that was poisoning his heart.

2661
03:10:39,840 --> 03:10:40,840
***

2662
03:10:40,840 --> 03:10:46,910
When M. Gillenormand saw his pale, lifeless-looking
grandson lying on the sofa, he shook from

2663
03:10:46,910 --> 03:10:48,410
head to foot.

2664
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:53,290
Leaning against the door for support, he murmured,
'Marius!'

2665
03:10:53,290 --> 03:10:56,910
'He has just been brought here,' said a servant.

2666
03:10:56,910 --> 03:10:58,840
'He was on the barricade and

2667
03:10:58,840 --> 03:11:01,649
'He's dead!'

2668
03:11:01,649 --> 03:11:03,979
cried the old man in a terrible voice.

2669
03:11:03,979 --> 03:11:05,680
'The fool!

2670
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:09,109
He did this to hurt me, the ungrateful boy.

2671
03:11:09,109 --> 03:11:16,210
I try to be good to him, and this is how he
rewards me!'

2672
03:11:16,210 --> 03:11:20,600
The old man walked to the window and, while
he complained to the night about the pain

2673
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:26,020
and grief his grandson had caused him, the
doctor arrived.

2674
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:32,080
After listening to Marius's heart, he organized
his removal to a bed in another room, and

2675
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:36,300
returned to M. Gillenormand, who was still
standing by the window.

2676
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:38,729
'Will he live?'

2677
03:11:38,729 --> 03:11:43,440
M. Gillenormand asked, his eyes wild with
fear.

2678
03:11:43,440 --> 03:11:47,630
'I don't know,' the doctor replied.

2679
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:53,960
'The wound to his body is not serious, but
there are deep cuts on his head.

2680
03:11:53,960 --> 03:12:00,480
It's difficult to say M. Gillenormand went
to Marius's bedside.

2681
03:12:00,480 --> 03:12:04,070
'You heartless boy,' he said angrily.

2682
03:12:04,070 --> 03:12:09,979
'A fool who prefers fighting to dancing and
having fun.

2683
03:12:09,979 --> 03:12:11,750
What kind of man are you?

2684
03:12:11,750 --> 03:12:14,580
Are you mad?

2685
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:16,540
But it makes no difference.

2686
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:19,340
I too shall die.

2687
03:12:19,340 --> 03:12:24,350
That makes you a murderer, a cold-hearted
killer.

2688
03:12:24,350 --> 03:12:27,020
I cannot feel grief for you.

2689
03:12:27,020 --> 03:12:36,899
At that moment, Marius's eyes slowly opened
and his gaze rested upon M. Gillenormand.

2690
03:12:36,899 --> 03:12:38,239
'Marius!'

2691
03:12:38,239 --> 03:12:39,920
the old man cried.

2692
03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:43,710
'Marius, my child, grandson!

2693
03:12:43,710 --> 03:12:47,500
You're alive after all!'

2694
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:49,590
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2695
03:12:49,590 --> 03:12:52,739
The Wedding

2696
03:12:52,739 --> 03:12:58,340
Marius lay for a long time between life and
death in a state of fever, endlessly repeating

2697
03:12:58,340 --> 03:13:00,590
the name of Cosette.

2698
03:13:00,590 --> 03:13:04,900
'He mustn't get excited,' the doctor warned.

2699
03:13:04,900 --> 03:13:09,800
Every day, according to one of the servants,
a white-haired, well-dressed gentleman came

2700
03:13:09,800 --> 03:13:12,970
to ask for news of the sick man.

2701
03:13:12,970 --> 03:13:18,950
Finally, after three months, the doctor announced
that Marius was out of danger.

2702
03:13:18,950 --> 03:13:24,939
But he had to spend the next two months resting
because of the damage to his shoulder.

2703
03:13:24,939 --> 03:13:30,450
M. Gillenormand grew happier as his grandson's
condition improved.

2704
03:13:30,450 --> 03:13:37,100
He did strange, unexpected things, like running
up and down stairs without knowing why.

2705
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:43,080
He gave his neighbour, a pretty woman, a bunch
of flowers, which greatly annoyed her husband.

2706
03:13:43,080 --> 03:13:48,680
Marius, meanwhile, tried to make sense of
what had happened to him.

2707
03:13:48,680 --> 03:13:54,439
He thought about Enjolras and Eponine, and
wondered why Cosette's father had been at

2708
03:13:54,439 --> 03:13:56,380
the barricade.

2709
03:13:56,380 --> 03:14:01,100
He could not understand why nobody could tell
him how he had been saved.

2710
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:06,320
All he knew was that he had been brought to
his grandfather's house in a carriage.

2711
03:14:06,320 --> 03:14:11,279
He noticed his grandfather's tenderness towards
him, but he could not forget the old man's

2712
03:14:11,279 --> 03:14:17,600
unfairness and cruelty to his father, who
had died penniless and unloved.

2713
03:14:17,600 --> 03:14:23,870
Most of all, however, he thought about Cosette,
and how he could find her again.

2714
03:14:23,870 --> 03:14:29,510
'There's something I have to say to you,'
Marius told his grandfather one day.

2715
03:14:29,510 --> 03:14:31,490
'What is it?'

2716
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:33,340
'I want to get married.'

2717
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:36,770
'But of course,' the old man laughed.

2718
03:14:36,770 --> 03:14:39,170
'What do you mean - of course?'

2719
03:14:39,170 --> 03:14:40,779
'That's understood.

2720
03:14:40,779 --> 03:14:43,880
You will have your little girl.'

2721
03:14:43,880 --> 03:14:49,770
'I don't understand,' Marius said, almost
speechless with amazement.

2722
03:14:49,770 --> 03:14:53,810
'You will have her,' the old man repeated.

2723
03:14:53,810 --> 03:15:00,940
'She comes here every day in the shape of
an old man who asks for news of you.

2724
03:15:00,940 --> 03:15:07,010
While you've been ill, she's spent her time
crying and making bandages for you.

2725
03:15:07,010 --> 03:15:09,840
I know all about her.

2726
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:14,420
She lives at Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

2727
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:17,570
You see, I'm not as unkind as you think.

2728
03:15:17,570 --> 03:15:23,350
I've found out that she's a charming girl
and that she loves you.

2729
03:15:23,350 --> 03:15:31,090
I knew you were angry with me, and I thought,
"What can I do to make him love me?"

2730
03:15:31,090 --> 03:15:35,529
Then I thought, "I can give him Cosette."

2731
03:15:35,529 --> 03:15:40,890
I wanted to invite her to see you, but the
doctor warned me that you would probably get

2732
03:15:40,890 --> 03:15:43,110
too excited.

2733
03:15:43,110 --> 03:15:49,210
So I advise you, dear boy, to eat more meat
and get better soon.

2734
03:15:49,210 --> 03:15:52,949
Then you can marry your Cosette and be happy.'

2735
03:15:52,949 --> 03:15:57,410
Having said this, the old man burst into tears.

2736
03:15:57,410 --> 03:16:02,840
He held Marius's head to his chest and they
cried together.

2737
03:16:02,840 --> 03:16:09,739
'Grandfather,' Marius said at last, 'I'm feeling
much better already.

2738
03:16:09,739 --> 03:16:10,890
When can I see her?'

2739
03:16:10,890 --> 03:16:13,550
'You can see her tomorrow.'

2740
03:16:13,550 --> 03:16:15,640
'Why not today?'

2741
03:16:15,640 --> 03:16:19,090
'All right, I'll fetch her today.

2742
03:16:19,090 --> 03:16:25,510
You've called me "grandfather"; you've shown
me that you love me after all.

2743
03:16:25,510 --> 03:16:29,909
You've earned your reward!'

2744
03:16:29,909 --> 03:16:30,909
***

2745
03:16:30,909 --> 03:16:34,520
Later that day, Cosette arrived at M. Gillenormand's
house.

2746
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:39,830
Standing beside her on the doorstep was a
white-haired man with a strangely nervous

2747
03:16:39,830 --> 03:16:40,860
smile.

2748
03:16:40,860 --> 03:16:46,470
M. Gillenormand showed them up to the room
where Marius was waiting.

2749
03:16:46,470 --> 03:16:49,330
Cosette stood in the doorway, overcome with
happiness.

2750
03:16:49,330 --> 03:16:55,470
She wanted to throw herself into Marius's
arms, but was unable to move, afraid to show

2751
03:16:55,470 --> 03:16:57,890
the world that she loved him.

2752
03:16:57,890 --> 03:16:58,920
'Monsieur.'

2753
03:16:58,920 --> 03:17:03,160
M. Gillenormand addressed Jean Valjean.

2754
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:11,199
'I have the honour, on behalf of my grandson,
Marius Pontmercy, to ask for your daughter's

2755
03:17:11,199 --> 03:17:14,040
hand in marriage.'

2756
03:17:14,040 --> 03:17:15,850
Jean Valjean bowed.

2757
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:23,729
'Good, then that is agreed,' M. Gillenormand
said and, turning to Marius and Cosette, he

2758
03:17:23,729 --> 03:17:30,520
added, 'My children, you are free to love
one another.'

2759
03:17:30,520 --> 03:17:34,250
When they were alone together, Cosette and
Marius kissed.

2760
03:17:34,250 --> 03:17:37,690
'Is it really you?'

2761
03:17:37,690 --> 03:17:39,189
Cosette murmured at last.

2762
03:17:39,189 --> 03:17:41,189
'I can't believe it.

2763
03:17:41,189 --> 03:17:43,069
I'm so happy to see you.

2764
03:17:43,069 --> 03:17:47,330
I was so excited today that I haven't even
dressed up for you.

2765
03:17:47,330 --> 03:17:48,630
I must look terrible.

2766
03:17:48,630 --> 03:17:51,630
But why don't you say something?

2767
03:17:51,630 --> 03:17:54,859
Why are you letting me do all the talking?

2768
03:17:54,859 --> 03:17:57,380
Do you still love me?

2769
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:59,529
Oh, I'm so wild with happiness

2770
03:17:59,529 --> 03:18:03,229
'My love...'

2771
03:18:03,229 --> 03:18:06,909
Marius whispered.

2772
03:18:06,909 --> 03:18:07,909
***

2773
03:18:07,909 --> 03:18:10,540
The wedding was arranged for February the
following year.

2774
03:18:10,540 --> 03:18:13,489
Jean Valjean arranged everything.

2775
03:18:13,489 --> 03:18:18,410
Having been a mayor, he knew how to solve
an awkward problem: the question of Cosette's

2776
03:18:18,410 --> 03:18:24,920
real family He told everybody that he was
not her father, but her guardian.

2777
03:18:24,920 --> 03:18:32,120
He also invented a dead family for Cosette,
so that everybody believed she was an orphan.

2778
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:39,479
Valjean, as her guardian, gave Cosette a large
amount of money - half a million francs - but

2779
03:18:39,479 --> 03:18:42,850
did not tell her that the money was his.

2780
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:48,590
He told her that the money came from a man
who preferred to remain unknown.

2781
03:18:48,590 --> 03:18:53,160
It was arranged that the couple, who could
not believe their sudden, new-found happiness,

2782
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:57,350
would live with M. Gillenormand after the
wedding.

2783
03:18:57,350 --> 03:19:03,710
Cosette, accompanied by Jean Valjean, visited
Marius every day.

2784
03:19:03,710 --> 03:19:06,610
Marius did not speak much to Valjean.

2785
03:19:06,610 --> 03:19:11,330
Despite enjoying an occasional conversation
with him, he found something strange about

2786
03:19:11,330 --> 03:19:12,830
the old man.

2787
03:19:12,830 --> 03:19:17,560
He could not believe that this was the same
man he had seen at the barricade all those

2788
03:19:17,560 --> 03:19:21,670
months ago - it seemed like a bad dream to
him.

2789
03:19:21,670 --> 03:19:26,790
But there were more important things for Marius
to think about.

2790
03:19:26,790 --> 03:19:31,950
Apart from preparing for his wedding, there
were two people that he wanted to find.

2791
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:35,250
First, there was Thenardier.

2792
03:19:35,250 --> 03:19:41,180
He was, without doubt, a bad man, but Marius
had promised his father to find him and help

2793
03:19:41,180 --> 03:19:42,380
him.

2794
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:47,330
He employed agents to find Thenardier, but
without success.

2795
03:19:47,330 --> 03:19:53,010
The only thing they discovered was that Mme
Thenardier had died, and that her husband

2796
03:19:53,010 --> 03:19:59,649
had escaped from prison and disappeared with
his surviving daughter, Azelma.

2797
03:19:59,649 --> 03:20:04,479
Second, there was the mysterious stranger
who had saved his life.

2798
03:20:04,479 --> 03:20:10,859
Marius's attempts to find him also ended in
failure, and the true story of his escape

2799
03:20:10,859 --> 03:20:16,359
from the barricade remained a complete mystery
to him.

2800
03:20:16,359 --> 03:20:21,830
One evening, when Marius was talking to Cosette
and Jean Valjean about the mystery and his

2801
03:20:21,830 --> 03:20:27,729
unsuccessful attempts to solve it, he became
angry with Cosette's guardian's lack of interest

2802
03:20:27,729 --> 03:20:29,160
in his story.

2803
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:32,739
'The man was a hero,' Marius said.

2804
03:20:32,739 --> 03:20:37,529
'Do you realize, Monsieur, how brave this
man was?

2805
03:20:37,529 --> 03:20:42,580
He rescued me from the field of battle and
carried me through the sewers of Paris.

2806
03:20:42,580 --> 03:20:47,030
He risked his life to save a dying man, and
why?

2807
03:20:47,030 --> 03:20:49,370
He was a total stranger.

2808
03:20:49,370 --> 03:20:51,670
He did it without any thought of a reward.

2809
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:55,270
Oh, I wish Cosette's money were mine.'

2810
03:20:55,270 --> 03:20:58,960
'It is yours,' Valjean reminded him.

2811
03:20:58,960 --> 03:21:03,700
'I would give it all,' said Marius,'to find
that man!'

2812
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:08,170
Jean Valjean was silent.

2813
03:21:08,170 --> 03:21:09,170
***

2814
03:21:09,170 --> 03:21:11,390
Cosette and Marius made a handsome couple
on their wedding day.

2815
03:21:11,390 --> 03:21:16,770
All previous unhappiness was forgotten as
they kissed in the church, watched proudly

2816
03:21:16,770 --> 03:21:19,970
by M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean.

2817
03:21:19,970 --> 03:21:25,069
There were flowers everywhere when they returned
to M. Gillenormand's house for the wedding

2818
03:21:25,069 --> 03:21:26,439
feast.

2819
03:21:26,439 --> 03:21:32,450
It was the happiest night of Cosette's life,
spoilt only by one thing: the fact that her

2820
03:21:32,450 --> 03:21:38,720
guardian - whom she still thought of as her
father - went home before the feast had started,

2821
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:41,790
saying that he felt ill.

2822
03:21:41,790 --> 03:21:44,319
But Cosette was not unhappy for long.

2823
03:21:44,319 --> 03:21:49,060
She had Marius, and she would be happy with
him for the rest of her life!

2824
03:21:49,060 --> 03:21:57,199
Jean Valjean, meanwhile, went home, lit his
candle and went upstairs to bed.

2825
03:21:57,199 --> 03:22:00,250
That night, however, he was unable to sleep.

2826
03:22:00,250 --> 03:22:05,320
He remembered the little girl he had rescued
from the Thenardiers ten years earlier, and

2827
03:22:05,320 --> 03:22:10,449
felt sad that he was no longer the most important
man in her life.

2828
03:22:10,449 --> 03:22:13,830
Another man was the centre of her universe.

2829
03:22:13,830 --> 03:22:18,910
He was proud of having helped to bring her
happiness with Marius, but another thing troubled

2830
03:22:18,910 --> 03:22:26,330
his soul: the fact that nobody, not even Cosette,
knew the truth about him.

2831
03:22:26,330 --> 03:22:32,470
That he was Jean Valjean, a criminal who had
spent nineteen years in prison and who had

2832
03:22:32,470 --> 03:22:37,710
stolen silver candlesticks from a trusting
and kind-hearted bishop.

2833
03:22:37,710 --> 03:22:44,050
He knew that if he told Cosette and Marius
the truth, he would spoil everybody's happiness

2834
03:22:44,050 --> 03:22:47,490
and he would lose their love and respect.

2835
03:22:47,490 --> 03:22:54,080
On the other hand, if he continued to lie
about his past, he would lose his own soul.

2836
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:57,060
What could he do?

2837
03:22:57,060 --> 03:22:58,060
***

2838
03:22:58,060 --> 03:23:04,540
The next day Valjean visited M. Gillenormand's
house, and asked to speak to Marius in private.

2839
03:23:04,540 --> 03:23:10,529
Marius hugged Valjean warmly, addressed him
as 'father' and invited him to lunch, but

2840
03:23:10,529 --> 03:23:19,450
Valjean shook his head and said, 'Monsieur,
I have something to tell you.'

2841
03:23:19,450 --> 03:23:24,109
Marius listened quietly as Valjean told him
everything about his life.

2842
03:23:24,109 --> 03:23:30,620
Finally, in a state of shock and confusion,
the young man said, 'Why have you told me

2843
03:23:30,620 --> 03:23:32,030
all this?

2844
03:23:32,030 --> 03:23:34,000
No one forced you to.'

2845
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:42,210
'If I had continued to keep my secret to myself,
I would have destroyed my own heart,' Valjean

2846
03:23:42,210 --> 03:23:43,330
replied.

2847
03:23:43,330 --> 03:23:47,160
'Besides, I belong to no family.

2848
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:52,199
Cosette was the only family I ever had.

2849
03:23:52,199 --> 03:23:56,100
Everything ended for me when she married you
yesterday.

2850
03:23:56,100 --> 03:23:59,070
She is happy with the man she loves.

2851
03:23:59,070 --> 03:24:05,910
I tried to persuade myself that it would be
better not to admit the truth about my past,

2852
03:24:05,910 --> 03:24:07,710
but it was no use.

2853
03:24:07,710 --> 03:24:13,710
I could not silence the voice that speaks
to me when I am alone.'

2854
03:24:13,710 --> 03:24:16,370
Neither of them spoke for several minutes.

2855
03:24:16,370 --> 03:24:20,779
Then Marius murmured, 'Poor Cosette.

2856
03:24:20,779 --> 03:24:21,779
When she hears

2857
03:24:21,779 --> 03:24:24,609
'But you must promise not to tell her!'

2858
03:24:24,609 --> 03:24:26,609
Valjean interrupted.

2859
03:24:26,609 --> 03:24:30,000
'She'll be heart-broken if she hears the truth
about me.

2860
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:32,989
I don't think I could bear it...

2861
03:24:32,989 --> 03:24:33,989
'

2862
03:24:33,989 --> 03:24:37,399
He sank into an armchair and buried his face
in his hands.

2863
03:24:37,399 --> 03:24:41,750
'Don't worry,' Marius said at last.

2864
03:24:41,750 --> 03:24:43,890
'I'll keep your secret.

2865
03:24:43,890 --> 03:24:47,720
But I think it would be better if you stopped
seeing her.'

2866
03:24:47,720 --> 03:24:53,860
'I understand,' Valjean said, rising to leave.

2867
03:24:53,860 --> 03:25:01,500
But at the door he half-turned and said, 'Monsieur,
if you will permit me, I would like to come

2868
03:25:01,500 --> 03:25:02,680
and see her.

2869
03:25:02,680 --> 03:25:06,870
I wouldn't come often or stay very long.

2870
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:10,819
We could meet in that little room on the ground
floor.

2871
03:25:10,819 --> 03:25:18,410
Please Monsieur, if I can't see Cosette again,
I'll have nothing left to live for.

2872
03:25:18,410 --> 03:25:26,569
Besides, if I suddenly stopped visiting, people
would become suspicious and begin to talk

2873
03:25:26,569 --> 03:25:31,010
'You can come every evening,' said Marius.

2874
03:25:31,010 --> 03:25:39,810
'Monsieur, you are very kind,' said Jean Valjean,
shaking Marius's hand and leaving the room.

2875
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:42,140
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2876
03:25:42,140 --> 03:25:46,229
The Truth at Last

2877
03:25:46,229 --> 03:25:51,630
Marius kept his promise about not telling
Cosette, and Valjean visited her every evening

2878
03:25:51,630 --> 03:25:54,649
in a small room on the ground floor.

2879
03:25:54,649 --> 03:26:00,020
It was cold and damp, but a fire had been
lit and two armchairs had been placed in front

2880
03:26:00,020 --> 03:26:01,040
of it.

2881
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:07,640
At first, Cosette could not understand why
Valjean refused to meet her upstairs.

2882
03:26:07,640 --> 03:26:13,239
When he refused to kiss her cheek, she began
to feel unhappy, afraid that she had done

2883
03:26:13,239 --> 03:26:15,449
something to offend him.

2884
03:26:15,449 --> 03:26:19,360
She pressed his hands in hers and held them
to her lips.

2885
03:26:19,360 --> 03:26:22,649
'Please, please be kind!'

2886
03:26:22,649 --> 03:26:23,710
she begged.

2887
03:26:23,710 --> 03:26:26,979
'I want you to come and live with us.

2888
03:26:26,979 --> 03:26:32,170
You'll always be my father and I'm not going
to let you go.'

2889
03:26:32,170 --> 03:26:34,090
He released his hands.

2890
03:26:34,090 --> 03:26:39,880
'You mustn't call me "father" any more,' he
told her.

2891
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:42,660
'You must call me "Monsieur Jean".'

2892
03:26:42,660 --> 03:26:47,710
'I don't understand,' she said, becoming angry.

2893
03:26:47,710 --> 03:26:48,990
'This is ridiculous.

2894
03:26:48,990 --> 03:26:54,000
You're upsetting me very much, and I don't
know why you're being so cruel.'

2895
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,930
'You don't need a father any more.

2896
03:26:56,930 --> 03:26:59,420
You have a husband.'

2897
03:26:59,420 --> 03:27:01,521
'What a thing to say!'

2898
03:27:01,521 --> 03:27:02,521
Cosette replied.

2899
03:27:02,521 --> 03:27:05,810
'Are you angry with me because I'm happy?'

2900
03:27:05,810 --> 03:27:11,910
'Cosette,' he said, 'your happiness is the
only thing that matters to me.

2901
03:27:11,910 --> 03:27:17,660
You're happy now, and so my work is complete.'

2902
03:27:17,660 --> 03:27:23,080
With these words, he picked up his hat and
left.

2903
03:27:23,080 --> 03:27:28,399
Jean Valjean continued his evening visits,
but the relationship between himself and Cosette

2904
03:27:28,399 --> 03:27:31,330
became cooler and more distant.

2905
03:27:31,330 --> 03:27:35,670
She stopped calling him 'father' or asking
him questions.

2906
03:27:35,670 --> 03:27:40,859
As 'Monsieur Jean', he gradually became a
different person to her, and she began not

2907
03:27:40,859 --> 03:27:43,800
to depend on him for her happiness.

2908
03:27:43,800 --> 03:27:52,000
Valjean would sit looking at Cosette in silence,
or would talk about incidents from their past.

2909
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:57,360
One evening in April, he called at the usual
time but was told that Cosette had gone out

2910
03:27:57,360 --> 03:27:59,730
with her husband.

2911
03:27:59,730 --> 03:28:05,580
He waited in the small, damp room for an hour
before sadly returning home.

2912
03:28:05,580 --> 03:28:10,620
Over the next few days, his visits began to
be interrupted by servants calling Cosette

2913
03:28:10,620 --> 03:28:12,550
to dinner.

2914
03:28:12,550 --> 03:28:17,990
When he arrived, he discovered that the fire
had not been lit, and the armchairs had been

2915
03:28:17,990 --> 03:28:20,310
left near the door.

2916
03:28:20,310 --> 03:28:26,330
One evening he discovered there were no chairs
in the room at all - he and Cosette had to

2917
03:28:26,330 --> 03:28:30,000
stand in the cold for their whole meeting.

2918
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:35,529
Valjean realized what was happening; Marius
was telling the servants not to make him welcome

2919
03:28:35,529 --> 03:28:37,810
any more.

2920
03:28:37,810 --> 03:28:44,940
That night he went home in despair, and the
next evening he did not come at all.

2921
03:28:44,940 --> 03:28:50,100
When Valjean did not appear for the second
evening, Cosette sent a servant to his house

2922
03:28:50,100 --> 03:28:52,859
to ask if he was well.

2923
03:28:52,859 --> 03:28:58,840
Valjean replied that he was very well, but
that he had business to attend to.

2924
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:04,080
He did not return to the house again, and
Cosette was too busy with married life to

2925
03:29:04,080 --> 03:29:06,590
think too much about him.

2926
03:29:06,590 --> 03:29:12,960
She did not realize that, every evening, Valjean
would walk slowly from his house until he

2927
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:16,820
reached the corner of the street where she
lived.

2928
03:29:16,820 --> 03:29:23,121
He would then stare at the house for several
minutes, tears rolling down his cheeks, before

2929
03:29:23,121 --> 03:29:28,989
turning round and slowly returning home.

2930
03:29:28,989 --> 03:29:29,989
***

2931
03:29:29,989 --> 03:29:33,710
Marius thought it was right to exclude Valjean
from Cosette's life.

2932
03:29:33,710 --> 03:29:37,750
He achieved this without cruelty, but without
weakness.

2933
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:44,290
Apart from the details about his life that
Valjean had confessed to him, he knew that

2934
03:29:44,290 --> 03:29:48,430
Valjean had killed Inspector Javert at the
barricade.

2935
03:29:48,430 --> 03:29:55,070
His private investigations into the old man's
past had also revealed an even more disgusting

2936
03:29:55,070 --> 03:29:56,380
fact.

2937
03:29:56,380 --> 03:30:03,680
He had discovered that Valjean's money really
belonged to somebody called Monsieur Madeleine,

2938
03:30:03,680 --> 03:30:09,890
a wealthy manufacturer from Montreuil who
had mysteriously disappeared.

2939
03:30:09,890 --> 03:30:16,290
He persuaded Cosette, therefore, not to use
any of the money her guardian had given her,

2940
03:30:16,290 --> 03:30:21,649
and to live on the money that he had started
to earn as a lawyer.

2941
03:30:21,649 --> 03:30:24,170
Cosette had not been happy about this.

2942
03:30:24,170 --> 03:30:29,010
She could not understand why her father, as
she still thought of Valjean, had stopped

2943
03:30:29,010 --> 03:30:30,830
visiting her.

2944
03:30:30,830 --> 03:30:33,530
She still loved him in her heart.

2945
03:30:33,530 --> 03:30:39,040
But she loved her husband even more, and she
gradually became used to not depending on

2946
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:43,080
the old man for her happiness.

2947
03:30:43,080 --> 03:30:51,650
One evening a servant brought Marius a letter,
saying, 'The writer is waiting in the hall.'

2948
03:30:51,650 --> 03:30:57,950
The smell of tobacco and the handwriting on
the envelope was so familiar that Marius immediately

2949
03:30:57,950 --> 03:31:00,439
thought of the Jondrettes.

2950
03:31:00,439 --> 03:31:02,330
He read the letter quickly.

2951
03:31:02,330 --> 03:31:07,870
It was signed 'Thenard', and was asking for
money.

2952
03:31:07,870 --> 03:31:10,090
Marius could not believe his luck.

2953
03:31:10,090 --> 03:31:14,890
He had tried without success to find the man
who had saved his father's lite at Waterloo,

2954
03:31:14,890 --> 03:31:18,540
and now the man had come to him!

2955
03:31:18,540 --> 03:31:22,390
He immediately asked the servant to show the
man in.

2956
03:31:22,390 --> 03:31:29,609
However, Marius had a shock when he saw the
man - he did not recognize him at all!

2957
03:31:29,609 --> 03:31:35,420
He was an old man with a big nose, glasses
and neat grey hair.

2958
03:31:35,420 --> 03:31:41,779
He was wearing smart black clothes, and a
gold watch chain hung from his jacket pocket.

2959
03:31:41,779 --> 03:31:44,680
'What do you want?'

2960
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:48,790
Marius asked coldly, as the stranger bowed
to him.

2961
03:31:48,790 --> 03:31:53,330
The stranger explained in great detail how
he used to work for the government in foreign

2962
03:31:53,330 --> 03:31:58,870
countries and that, now he was retired, he
wanted to move to South America with his wife

2963
03:31:58,870 --> 03:32:00,490
and daughter.

2964
03:32:00,490 --> 03:32:04,390
Unfortunately, it was a long journey, and
he needed money.

2965
03:32:04,390 --> 03:32:07,340
'What has that to do with me?'

2966
03:32:07,340 --> 03:32:12,840
'Has M. Pontmercy not read my letter?'

2967
03:32:12,840 --> 03:32:17,840
Marius had only read the letter quickly, and
could not remember the details, so he said,

2968
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:19,430
'Go on.'

2969
03:32:19,430 --> 03:32:25,580
'I have a secret to tell you, M. Pontmercy,'
the stranger said.

2970
03:32:25,580 --> 03:32:28,870
'I'll tell you the first part for nothing.

2971
03:32:28,870 --> 03:32:30,891
I think you'll be interested;

2972
03:32:30,891 --> 03:32:32,120
'Well?'

2973
03:32:32,120 --> 03:32:38,899
'The man you think is your wife's guardian
is a murderer and a thief.

2974
03:32:38,899 --> 03:32:42,010
His name is Jean Valjean.'

2975
03:32:42,010 --> 03:32:43,990
'I know that.'

2976
03:32:43,990 --> 03:32:48,270
'Did you know that he spent nineteen years
in prison?'

2977
03:32:48,270 --> 03:32:51,470
'I know that too.'

2978
03:32:51,470 --> 03:32:57,350
The stranger narrowed his eyes, trying to
hide his disappointment and anger at Marius's

2979
03:32:57,350 --> 03:32:58,350
calmness.

2980
03:32:58,350 --> 03:33:00,410
Then he gave a strange smile.

2981
03:33:00,410 --> 03:33:04,590
'I have more information to tell you.

2982
03:33:04,590 --> 03:33:09,080
It concerns money that belongs to your wife.

2983
03:33:09,080 --> 03:33:16,620
It's a remarkable secret and I'll sell the
information to you for 20,000 francs.'

2984
03:33:16,620 --> 03:33:23,260
'I know this secret already,' Marius said,
'just as I knew the others.'

2985
03:33:23,260 --> 03:33:25,240
'10,000 francs?'

2986
03:33:25,240 --> 03:33:28,800
'I repeat, you have nothing to tell me.'

2987
03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:32,130
'But I need to eat, Monsieur!'

2988
03:33:32,130 --> 03:33:34,370
the visitor said, losing confidence.

2989
03:33:34,370 --> 03:33:37,990
'I'll tell you for twenty francs.'

2990
03:33:37,990 --> 03:33:41,521
'I know it already,' Marius said.

2991
03:33:41,521 --> 03:33:42,600
'I know everything.

2992
03:33:42,600 --> 03:33:46,080
I even know your real name.

2993
03:33:46,080 --> 03:33:49,180
It's Thenardier.'

2994
03:33:49,180 --> 03:33:55,311
The visitor laughed, but Marius went on, 'You're
also Jondrette.

2995
03:33:55,311 --> 03:33:58,580
And you once had an inn in Montfermeil.'

2996
03:33:58,580 --> 03:34:01,060
'I deny it!'

2997
03:34:01,060 --> 03:34:07,290
'You're a completely rotten man, but I'll
give you this.'

2998
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:11,590
Marius took a banknote out of his pocket and
threw it in the stranger's face.

2999
03:34:11,590 --> 03:34:14,840
'Thank you, M. Pontmercy!'

3000
03:34:14,840 --> 03:34:18,130
the man said, examining the note.

3001
03:34:18,130 --> 03:34:19,950
'500 francs!

3002
03:34:19,950 --> 03:34:21,630
That's real money.

3003
03:34:21,630 --> 03:34:28,340
Oh well, I suppose we can relax.'

3004
03:34:28,340 --> 03:34:34,771
With those words, he removed his false nose,
glasses and neat grey wig.

3005
03:34:34,771 --> 03:34:41,729
'M. Pontmercy is absolutely right,' he said,
changing his voice.

3006
03:34:41,729 --> 03:34:44,790
'I am Thenardier.'

3007
03:34:44,790 --> 03:34:48,790
He waited for a few seconds to see Marius's
reaction.

3008
03:34:48,790 --> 03:34:54,490
Marius, meanwhile, was grateful for finally
having the chance to help Thenardier, and

3009
03:34:54,490 --> 03:34:57,840
therefore to keep the promise he had made
to his father.

3010
03:34:57,840 --> 03:35:03,410
Thenardier's presence, however, offered him
another opportunity; it gave him the chance

3011
03:35:03,410 --> 03:35:07,080
to solve the mystery of Cosette's fortune.

3012
03:35:07,080 --> 03:35:09,180
'Thenardier,' he said.

3013
03:35:09,180 --> 03:35:14,930
'Shall I tell you the secret that you were
planning to sell me?

3014
03:35:14,930 --> 03:35:21,830
I, too, have sources of information, and probably
know more about the subject than you do.

3015
03:35:21,830 --> 03:35:27,370
Jean Valjean, as you say, is a murderer and
a thief.

3016
03:35:27,370 --> 03:35:34,720
He's a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer
and mayor of Montreuil, M. Madeleine.

3017
03:35:34,720 --> 03:35:41,350
Jean Valjean, who knew the mayor's background,
reported him to the police and took advantage

3018
03:35:41,350 --> 03:35:46,939
of his arrest to take over half a million
francs from his Paris bank.

3019
03:35:46,939 --> 03:35:50,609
The manager of the bank told me this himself.

3020
03:35:50,609 --> 03:35:53,620
And he murdered the policeman, Javert.

3021
03:35:53,620 --> 03:35:57,930
I know this because I was there at the time.'

3022
03:35:57,930 --> 03:36:05,319
Thenardier looked puzzled for a moment, then
said, 'Monsieur, I think you are mistaken.'

3023
03:36:05,319 --> 03:36:07,949
'What!

3024
03:36:07,949 --> 03:36:09,609
Are you denying what I said?

3025
03:36:09,609 --> 03:36:11,370
Those are facts!'

3026
03:36:11,370 --> 03:36:16,670
'They are incorrect, and I do not like to
hear a man unjustly accused.

3027
03:36:16,670 --> 03:36:23,110
Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine, nor
did he kill Javert.'

3028
03:36:23,110 --> 03:36:25,180
'How do you know?'

3029
03:36:25,180 --> 03:36:32,229
'First, he did not kill M. Madeleine because
he was M. Madeleine!

3030
03:36:32,229 --> 03:36:37,601
And second, he did not kill Javert because
Javert killed himself.

3031
03:36:37,601 --> 03:36:41,319
He killed himself by jumping into the river.'

3032
03:36:41,319 --> 03:36:44,690
'What proof do you have?'

3033
03:36:44,690 --> 03:36:47,270
Marius said, wide-eyed with disbelief.

3034
03:36:47,270 --> 03:36:53,960
'I have all the proof here,' Thenardier said,
producing an envelope in which there were

3035
03:36:53,960 --> 03:36:56,680
several documents and newspaper articles.

3036
03:36:56,680 --> 03:37:03,120
'I've spent a long time discovering the truth
about Jean Valjean.'

3037
03:37:03,120 --> 03:37:08,850
Marius studied the documents carefully, then
looked up with a smile of joy.

3038
03:37:08,850 --> 03:37:12,370
'But he's a splendid man!

3039
03:37:12,370 --> 03:37:18,540
The fortune was really his, and he's not a
murderer or thief at all!

3040
03:37:18,540 --> 03:37:22,060
He's a hero and a saint!'

3041
03:37:22,060 --> 03:37:27,210
'He's a thief and a murderer,'Thenardier said
quietly.

3042
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:29,580
'What do you mean?'

3043
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:36,910
'I told you that I do not like to see a man
accused unjustly, but I do like to see a man

3044
03:37:36,910 --> 03:37:39,320
punished for crimes he has committed.'

3045
03:37:39,320 --> 03:37:43,530
'And what crimes are those?'

3046
03:37:43,530 --> 03:37:49,100
Thenardier sat down and told Marius about
the time he had helped Valjean to escape from

3047
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:50,699
the Paris sewer.

3048
03:37:50,699 --> 03:37:55,280
'He was carrying the body of a man he had
robbed and killed,' Thenardier said.

3049
03:37:55,280 --> 03:38:01,021
'Look, I have a piece of cloth from the dead
man's coat as proof.'

3050
03:38:01,021 --> 03:38:08,220
He produced a muddy piece of cloth and showed
it to Marius, who immediately went pale and

3051
03:38:08,220 --> 03:38:10,810
rose unsteadily to his feet.

3052
03:38:10,810 --> 03:38:18,160
As Thenardier continued to talk, Marius opened
a cupboard door and took out a coat.

3053
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:21,239
'That man was me!'

3054
03:38:21,239 --> 03:38:22,590
Marius cried.

3055
03:38:22,590 --> 03:38:25,880
'And here is the coat I was wearing!'

3056
03:38:25,880 --> 03:38:32,660
Thenardier stared at the coat and the cloth
in his hands, speechless with fear.

3057
03:38:32,660 --> 03:38:38,060
He was even more surprised when, instead of
chasing him out of the room, Marius ran towards

3058
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:42,939
him and pressed several thousand-franc notes
into his hand.

3059
03:38:42,939 --> 03:38:46,510
'You're a terrible man,' Marius said.

3060
03:38:46,510 --> 03:38:48,590
'A thief and a liar.

3061
03:38:48,590 --> 03:38:53,550
You came here to destroy a man, but you have
done the opposite.

3062
03:38:53,550 --> 03:38:58,910
If you hadn't saved my father's life at Waterloo,
I'd report you to the police.

3063
03:38:58,910 --> 03:39:05,540
I know that your wife is dead, but take the
money and start a new life in America with

3064
03:39:05,540 --> 03:39:07,540
your daughter.

3065
03:39:07,540 --> 03:39:11,760
When you arrive there, I'll send you another
20,000 francs.

3066
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:14,250
Now get out.

3067
03:39:14,250 --> 03:39:18,080
I never want to see you again!'

3068
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:26,779
When Thenardier had left, unable to believe
his good fortune, Marius ran to find Cosette

3069
03:39:26,779 --> 03:39:29,310
and told her everything immediately.

3070
03:39:29,310 --> 03:39:33,340
'We must go to him at once,' Marius said.

3071
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:35,720
'He was the man who saved my life.

3072
03:39:35,720 --> 03:39:39,260
We must waste no time!'

3073
03:39:39,260 --> 03:39:48,500
Minutes later, he and Cosette were travelling
in a carriage to Number 7, rue de l'Homme-Arme.

3074
03:39:48,500 --> 03:39:49,500
***

3075
03:39:49,500 --> 03:39:55,600
Jean Valjean looked up when he heard the knock
on his door and called in a weak voice, 'Come

3076
03:39:55,600 --> 03:39:56,750
in.'

3077
03:39:56,750 --> 03:40:01,189
The door opened and Marius and Cosette appeared.

3078
03:40:01,189 --> 03:40:04,899
Cosette rushed to the chair where Jean Valjean
was sitting.

3079
03:40:04,899 --> 03:40:06,010
'Father!'

3080
03:40:06,010 --> 03:40:09,420
she cried, falling into his arms.

3081
03:40:09,420 --> 03:40:12,500
'So you've forgiven me?'

3082
03:40:12,500 --> 03:40:18,109
Valjean whispered, hugging Cosette to him
and turning to Marius.

3083
03:40:18,109 --> 03:40:22,229
'Cosette, did you hear what he said?'

3084
03:40:22,229 --> 03:40:26,820
Marius cried, tears of shame and guilt rolling
down his cheeks.

3085
03:40:26,820 --> 03:40:31,100
'He asked me to forgive him.

3086
03:40:31,100 --> 03:40:32,859
And do you know what he did?

3087
03:40:32,859 --> 03:40:36,820
He saved my life and he brought me back to
you.

3088
03:40:36,820 --> 03:40:40,890
He came to the barricade to save me, just
as he saved Javert.

3089
03:40:40,890 --> 03:40:45,859
He carried me on his back through the sewers
of Paris, to bring me to you.

3090
03:40:45,859 --> 03:40:51,950
Oh Cosette, I feel so ashamed of the way I've
treated him!'

3091
03:40:51,950 --> 03:40:57,250
'You have no need to say all this,' Valjean
murmured.

3092
03:40:57,250 --> 03:41:00,300
'Why didn't you say it yourself?'

3093
03:41:00,300 --> 03:41:01,300
Marius demanded.

3094
03:41:01,300 --> 03:41:07,040
'Why didn't you tell me that you were M. Madeleine
and that you saved Javert's life at the barricade?

3095
03:41:07,040 --> 03:41:11,080
Why didn't you tell me that I owed you my
life?'

3096
03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:17,120
'Because I thought it would be better to break
away.

3097
03:41:17,120 --> 03:41:23,189
If you had known the truth, you would have
felt obliged to be good to me, a worthless

3098
03:41:23,189 --> 03:41:24,189
criminal.

3099
03:41:24,189 --> 03:41:26,450
That would have upset everything.'

3100
03:41:26,450 --> 03:41:30,449
'What or whom would it have upset?'

3101
03:41:30,449 --> 03:41:31,449
Marius said.

3102
03:41:31,449 --> 03:41:34,460
'Well, we're not going to allow you to stay
here on your own.

3103
03:41:34,460 --> 03:41:37,070
You're going to come home with us.

3104
03:41:37,070 --> 03:41:40,220
You're Cosette's father and mine.

3105
03:41:40,220 --> 03:41:42,430
I won't allow you to spend another day here.'

3106
03:41:42,430 --> 03:41:50,170
'And you can't refuse this time,' Cosette
agreed, sitting on Jean Valjean's lap and

3107
03:41:50,170 --> 03:41:51,590
kissing his forehead.

3108
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:54,420
'There's a carriage waiting for you.

3109
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:58,909
I'm kidnapping you - by force, if necessary!'

3110
03:41:58,909 --> 03:42:04,420
Jean Valjean listened as she described the
view from the room that would be his, the

3111
03:42:04,420 --> 03:42:09,660
beauty of the garden, the singing of the birds,
but he was listening more to the music of

3112
03:42:09,660 --> 03:42:12,680
her voice than to the meaning of her words.

3113
03:42:12,680 --> 03:42:19,430
Finally, he said, 'Yes, it would be delightful,
but

3114
03:42:19,430 --> 03:42:25,000
Cosette, frightened, took his two hands in
hers.

3115
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:28,250
'Your hands are so cold,' she said.

3116
03:42:28,250 --> 03:42:29,319
'Are you ill?

3117
03:42:29,319 --> 03:42:31,310
Are you in pain?'

3118
03:42:31,310 --> 03:42:34,489
'No,' said Valjean.

3119
03:42:34,489 --> 03:42:36,460
'I'm not in pain.

3120
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:37,899
But

3121
03:42:37,899 --> 03:42:39,850
'But what?'

3122
03:42:39,850 --> 03:42:42,210
'I'm going to die soon.'

3123
03:42:42,210 --> 03:42:44,659
'Father, no!'

3124
03:42:44,659 --> 03:42:45,659
Cosette cried.

3125
03:42:45,659 --> 03:42:46,870
'You're going to live!

3126
03:42:46,870 --> 03:42:50,650
You must live, do you understand?'

3127
03:42:50,650 --> 03:42:55,500
Marius and Cosette both did their best to
raise Valjean's spirits, to show him how much

3128
03:42:55,500 --> 03:43:01,939
they loved and needed him, to fill him with
the strength and the desire to live again.

3129
03:43:01,939 --> 03:43:04,040
But it was too late.

3130
03:43:04,040 --> 03:43:10,020
Valjean smiled, his eyes shining with love
and happiness, but he was beginning to lose

3131
03:43:10,020 --> 03:43:11,020
strength.

3132
03:43:11,020 --> 03:43:15,180
'To die is nothing,' he murmured.

3133
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:19,960
'But it is terrible not to live.'

3134
03:43:19,960 --> 03:43:26,989
Then, taking Cosette's sleeve and pressing
it to his lips, he said, 'Come close to me,

3135
03:43:26,989 --> 03:43:29,300
both of you.

3136
03:43:29,300 --> 03:43:32,370
I love you dearly.

3137
03:43:32,370 --> 03:43:36,800
How sweet it is to die like this.

3138
03:43:36,800 --> 03:43:40,120
And you love me too, dear Cosette.

3139
03:43:40,120 --> 03:43:45,920
You'll feel some grief for me, but not too
much.

3140
03:43:45,920 --> 03:43:49,949
I want you to have no great sorrows.

3141
03:43:49,949 --> 03:43:54,080
You must enjoy life, my children.

3142
03:43:54,080 --> 03:43:58,740
I'm leaving the two candlesticks by the bed
to Cosette.

3143
03:43:58,740 --> 03:44:06,760
They're made of silver, but to me they are
pure gold.

3144
03:44:06,760 --> 03:44:12,800
I don't know whether the person who gave them
to me is pleased as he looks down on me from

3145
03:44:12,800 --> 03:44:15,080
above.

3146
03:44:15,080 --> 03:44:17,659
I've done my best.

3147
03:44:17,659 --> 03:44:27,620
You mustn't forget, my children, that, despite
my money, I am one of the poor.'

3148
03:44:27,620 --> 03:44:33,550
As he spoke, Valjean's breathing became more
painful and he had difficulty moving his arms.

3149
03:44:33,550 --> 03:44:40,500
But as the weakness of his body increased,
his spirit grew in strength.

3150
03:44:40,500 --> 03:44:44,930
The light of an unknown world was shining
brightly in his eyes.

3151
03:44:44,930 --> 03:44:55,330
'Now, Cosette,' he breathed softly, 'the time
has come for me to tell you your mother's

3152
03:44:55,330 --> 03:44:57,130
name.

3153
03:44:57,130 --> 03:45:00,920
It was Fantine.

3154
03:45:00,920 --> 03:45:03,550
You must not forget it.

3155
03:45:03,550 --> 03:45:09,710
Your mother loved you greatly and she suffered
greatly.

3156
03:45:09,710 --> 03:45:14,790
She was as rich in sorrow as you are in happiness.

3157
03:45:14,790 --> 03:45:18,790
That is how God balances things out.

3158
03:45:18,790 --> 03:45:27,189
He watches us all from above and knows what
he is doing among his splendid stars.

3159
03:45:27,189 --> 03:45:33,989
And now I must leave you, my children.

3160
03:45:33,989 --> 03:45:37,030
Love one another always.

3161
03:45:37,030 --> 03:45:48,060
There is nothing else that matters in this
world except love.'

3162
03:45:48,060 --> 03:45:54,370
Cosette and Marius fell to their knees on
either side of him, holding back their tears.

3163
03:45:54,370 --> 03:46:00,570
Jean Valjean's hands rested on their bowed
heads, and did not move again.

3164
03:46:00,570 --> 03:46:08,939
He lay back with his head turned to the sky,
the light from the two silver candlesticks

3165
03:46:08,939 --> 03:46:09,690
falling on his smiling, peaceful face.
