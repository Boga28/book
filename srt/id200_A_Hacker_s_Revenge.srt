00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,270
CHAPTER ONE
The New Computer System

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:20,820
At exactly 8.20 Mr Henry Williams walked through
the doors of the bank. He was the manager

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,270
and had worked there for twenty years. He
wasn't always calm and relaxed when he arrived

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:33,030
at work but yesterday something had happened
to make his life much easier. He looked around

5
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,870
the bank. There were beautiful new computers
on every desk.

6
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:46,379
Some were connected to printers, others to
scanners. The CPUs were hidden under the desks

7
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,950
and the keyboards waited to be used. On each
mouse pad was a mouse with a small red light,

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,300
which lit up when the computer was switched
on. The VDUs shone as the sun came through

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,540
the window. Mr Williams smiled. When he entered
his office, he saw that his secretary had

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,970
already arrived.

11
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,280
"Morning, Mr Williams," she said happily.
She was a very nice girl with long, blonde

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,360
hair and a big smile but she wasn't the most
efficient secretary in the world.

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,030
"Good morning, Belinda. Are you looking forward
to discovering the wonderful things that your

14
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,640
new computer can do?"

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,280
She looked worried. "Yes, but I hope I don't
make too many mistakes. Yesterday I nearly

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,380
lost some important information because I
pressed the wrong key."

17
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,040
"Don't worry. I know you've only been here
for six months. Mike has assured me that we

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,310
now have the most up-to-date computer hardware
and software are the most secure system money

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,829
can buy."

20
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,250
Mike Black was the bank's network manager
and head of technology. He had organized and

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,500
set up the new system.

22
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,240
At that moment someone knocked on the door
and Mike came in.

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,890
"Morning, Mr Williams. How are you?" he said.

24
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,080
"Very well, thank you, Mike. Now, are you
sure the system is functioning properly? Can

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,160
I go on holiday next week to the Caribbean
without worrying about things back here?"

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,420
Mike smiled. "Things couldn't be better. Our
LAN is working perfectly. It is now connected

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,710
to the bank's WAN and the security access
rights are..."

28
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,050
"Mike, you know that my knowledge of computers
is very limited. I'm afraid I belong to another

29
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,220
generation - which is why I pay you to solve
our IT problems."

30
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,380
IT terms were a foreign language to Henry
Williams. His son Robbie was only 15 but he

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,611
was already a computer genius and sat in front
of his monitor for hours every day. He had

32
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:53,360
no problem logging on and off, surfing the
net or downloading files. His father was an

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,280
excellent bank manager but unfortunately he
had no idea what these terms meant. He was

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,730
grateful for experts like Mike who could decipher
these mysteries for him.

35
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,970
"Don't worry. You can have a wonderful time
in the Caribbean. Things couldn't be better

36
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,640
here," replied Mike.

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,560
He left the office and Mr Williams sat down
at his desk on which there was no computer

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,099
at all, either new or old.

39
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:23,450
He was dreaming of blue seas and white beaches
when a cry from Belinda's desk brought him

40
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:30,020
back to reality. "Mr Williams, my computer
has crashed!" As soon as she had said the

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,680
words, they heard similar cries of alarm coming
from the bank's main area downstairs.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:47,290
One by one the computers were crashing...

43
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,370
CHAPTER TWO
A Problem

44
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,250
Mr Williams ran down the escalator and into
the main office area. What was happening?

45
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,870
All the computers were down. Everyone was
trying to reboot but it was impossible. Henry

46
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,690
Williams tried not to panic. He asked Belinda
to call Mike and tell him to come immediately.

47
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,099
Then he said to his staff, "Don't worry, everyone.
I'm sure it's a minor problem that Mike will

48
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,600
soon resolve." A young bank teller whispered
to a colleague, "He said that last week when

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,310
that virus destroyed most of our files. Remember?"

50
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,120
His friend smiled. Someone had sent an e-mail
to all the staff which promised to show photos

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,580
of Belinda's new boyfriend. Belinda was very
popular with the staff in the bank so naturally

52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,760
everyone opened it. But there was no photo,
just a virus which corrupted the entire system.

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,270
Mike, who still didn't know about the problem,
arrived in the lift just as strange things

54
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,889
began to happen. First the lights went off,
leaving the bank in darkness. Then a client

55
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,139
came in to complain to a cashier that he couldn't
access his account from the ATM outside the

56
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:06,870
bank. Then the lights came on again but the
doors closed automatically, locking everyone

57
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,500
in the bank. Mr Williams said sarcastically,
"As you can see, Mike, our new system is working

58
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,150
perfectly. Nobody can do any work, the clients
are angry, and we are all prisoners in the

59
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,280
bank!"

60
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,500
Mike smiled nervously. "I'm sure it's nothing.
I'll take a look at the server and see what

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,560
the problem is." Mike was the only person
with total security access rights for the

62
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,210
system and he had the only copy of the password
list. He was very good at his job so he wasn't

63
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,910
too worried about these "hiccups." He went
to the main computer and put in his password.

64
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,750
A message appeared on the screen:

65
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,220
Access Denied

66
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,680
Password Invalid

67
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,320
Everyone in the bank was watching him. Mike
took his password list from his wallet. He

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:03,729
typed in his password again, slowly and carefully.
Every time he tried the same message appeared

69
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:10,490
on the screen. "That's impossible," he cried.
His face was white with tension. Mr Williams

70
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,600
was waiting for an explanation. "Is everything
OK?" he asked. Mike prepared to give his boss

71
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,930
the bad news.

72
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,729
"It seems that... someone has obtained the
passwords for the new system and... has changed

73
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:25,729
them."

74
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:31,360
"And what exactly does that mean?" asked his
boss angrily. Mike took a deep breath.

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,979
"It means that this person now has total control
of the bank."

76
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:42,759
At that moment the doors of the bank miraculously
opened again. No one spoke. The silence was

77
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:52,650
broken only by the noise of the clock on the
wall. All the staff were waiting for Mr Williams'

78
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,650
reaction.

79
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,190
"And tell me, how did this person get the
passwords?" asked Mr Williams quietly.

80
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,930
"I have no idea," replied Mike. "I always
keep the password list in my wallet. No one

81
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,610
else has ever seen it. It's a complete mystery."

82
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,010
"No!" shouted Mr Williams. "The mystery is
why I gave you a job. First the virus and

83
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,039
now this. Well, you can start looking for
a new job. You're sacked!"

84
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,080
Mike left the bank without a word. He didn't
look at anyone. He knew that it was his fault.

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,651
Belinda's voice broke the silence. "Oh, Mr
Williams, what are we going to do?" Before

86
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,789
he could answer, the computer displayed a
new message:

87
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:48,340
E-mail arriving for Henry Williams

88
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:55,110
CHAPTER THREE
Are You Ready to Play, Henry?

89
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,389
Mr Williams turned to the bank staff and said,
"Please, continue to work as normal. There

90
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,919
is nothing to worry about."

91
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,949
Everyone looked surprised. How could they
work without computers? It would be impossible.

92
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:15,580
No one moved and no one spoke. Mr Williams
repeated his message: "Back to work now, please.

93
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,289
Our clients will arrive soon and we must be
ready." As his staff slowly began to return

94
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:27,599
to work, the bank manager sat down in front
of the server. Belinda stood next to him.

95
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,270
Mr Williams looked at the screen. He was now
extremely worried. He hesitated for a moment.

96
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,940
Belinda thought he was in difficulty and she
wanted to help. "You have to click on the

97
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,970
e-mail icon in the comer of the screen," she
said. "I know, I know. I'm not completely

98
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:51,350
stupid!" her boss shouted. Some members of
staff looked at one another and smiled. Belinda

99
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,800
knew Mr Williams well. She knew that when
he was angry, as he was now, it was better

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,670
to say nothing. She watched silently as he
clicked on the icon. The mailbox appeared

101
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,070
and revealed the subject of the new message:

102
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,570
Are you ready to play, Henry Williams?

103
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,160
Yes, he was ready. He had no idea who had
sent the e-mail but he wanted an explanation

104
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,670
and an end to this situation. He opened the
message and the screen filled with words.

105
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,140
Hello Henry!

106
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:34,970
How are you today? Happy? Or maybe worried?
Or even angry! I haven't seen you for a long

107
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:43,080
time but I can tell you that I am very, very
annoyed with you. You are not my favorite

108
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,649
person. How many enemies do you have? AT least
one - me! I am going to make you pay for what

109
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:58,470
you did to me before. As you know, I have
entered your new and secure (ha! ha!) computer

110
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,670
system and guess what? It's MY system now.
It was so easy to discover the passwords.

111
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:13,320
You should be more careful, Henry. You don't
mind if I call you Henry, do you?

112
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,290
Mr Williams was definitely angry now, and
confused. He asked Belinda, "Who is this person?

113
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,630
What does he want? Or maybe it's a woman?
Why is he (or she) angry? I'm an honest and

114
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,589
respectable man and people like me - well,
most people. Isn't that true, Belinda?" He

115
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,520
turned to look at Belinda, hoping that she
would give him the answer he wanted to hear,

116
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,460
but she wasn't listening. She was reading
the rest of the message as it appeared...

117
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,310
I have changed all the passwords so now I
control everything in your bank. Be nice to

118
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:53,810
me or I will lock the door again - or perhaps
I'll do something much worse! But don't be

119
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,089
afraid; I know that you're an intelligent
(ha! ha!) man, Henry, so I am going to give

120
00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:03,370
you a chance to save your precious bank. We
are going to play a game. If you win, the

121
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,551
bank will be saved. If you lose... the bank
will be destroyed! Do you like my idea? I

122
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:22,269
think it's great! It means that the fate of
the bank, your bank, is in your own hands.

123
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:35,860
So, Henry, my friend... are you ready to play?

124
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,120
CHAPTER FOUR
Don't Call the Police!

125
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,570
It was very noisy in the bank. Clients were
arriving and the staff had to tell them that

126
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,860
there was a problem with the computers. Some
clients left immediately, some were angry

127
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,170
and began to shout, others wanted to see the
manager. But Mr Williams had no time to speak

128
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:03,209
to anyone. He had a problem too. A big problem.
Two members of his staff had moved the server

129
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,589
to his office. It was much quieter in there
and he could think without anyone disturbing

130
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:08,940
him.

131
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,060
Belinda was sitting next to him. She was beginning
to panic and when she felt like that she couldn't

132
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,060
stop talking.

133
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,620
"What a horrible man. I'm sure it's a man.
He's so evil. What are you going to do, Mr

134
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,460
Williams? What a terrible situation! I want
to help you but I just don't know what to

135
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,680
do. Shall we call the police? I'm sure..."

136
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,649
Mr Williams couldn't concentrate. His secretary
was talking faster and faster.

137
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,889
"Belinda, why don't you go and make me a nice
cup of tea?"

138
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,589
Belinda smiled brightly and went out of the
office. A nice cup of tea was the solution

139
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:45,170
to all problems in her opinion.

140
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,120
So, undisturbed, Mr Williams was able to read
the final part of the mysterious e-mail.

141
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,810
This is the game: I will send you three puzzles,
one at a time. You must solve these puzzles

142
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,810
in just 24 hours.

143
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:07,270
That's plenty of time for an intelligent man
like you, Henry. You'll probably need to be

144
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:14,490
a computer expert to solve them, but you use
computers every day, don't you? (Ha! ha!)

145
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,730
If you fail to solve all three puzzles, I
will empty every bank account in your bank

146
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:29,730
from the smallest to the largest. all the
money will disappear and your bank will be

147
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,839
destroyed.

148
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:40,580
One final thing - DON'T call the police. That
would be very stupid. If you call the police,

149
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,430
I will know.

150
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:51,660
Remember that I can destroy your bank in a
few seconds. Don't risk it, Henry.

151
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,480
Do you think this is all a joke? I want to
show you that I am very serious. Henry, do

152
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,570
you know how much money you have in your bank
account? Are you sure?

153
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,230
Why don't you check? I think you'll be surprised!

154
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:18,070
Now I am going to give your staff access to
the computers so the bank can function as

155
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,209
normal. You see, I'm not so evil, but remember
that I can switch off the computers or change

156
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,660
anything at any time.

157
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,779
Bye for now, but don't worry... I'll be back
soon.

158
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:38,630
Mr Williams sat back in his chair. He had
a bad headache. Things were not improving.

159
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:46,660
He was thinking about what to do when he heard
shouts of joy coming from the bank staff downstairs.

160
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:56,890
The door opened and Belinda came in with the
tea. "The computers are working again, Mr

161
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,860
Williams. Isn't that wonderful? Everything
is back to normal. Maybe the e-mail was just

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
a joke."

163
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:10,040
"Well, we'll know in a moment, Belinda," he
replied. There were two things that Mr Williams

164
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,690
could do on a computer - use e-mail and access
his own bank account. Why did the mystery

165
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:24,040
hacker tell him to check his account? He put
in his password and then his account number

166
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:38,310
and waited. After a few seconds the information
he wanted appeared on the screen...

167
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,170
CHAPTER FIVE
Puzzle Number One

168
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:51,470
Mr Williams stared at the computer screen,
horrified. His hank account was empty! The

169
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,399
bank manager quickly closed the page but Belinda
had already seen it. She dropped her cup of

170
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:07,410
tea and began to cry. Before Henry Williams
could say a word, another message appeared

171
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,620
on the screen.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,800
E-mail arriving for Henry Williams Puzzle
Number One

173
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,150
Mr Williams clicked to open the message and
looked at the first puzzle. There were just

174
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,920
a few words and lots of strange symbols and
abbreviations.

175
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,540
It's 9.15 and time to play!

176
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,899
WU Henry? I C that UR : - ( Y?

177
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:40,529

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,170
TAFN I'll BBL

180
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,709
EOM HAND (LOL)

181
00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:01,920
Henry, do you like the first puzzle? Isn't
it cool? Cool and wicked. The clock has started

182
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,890
to tick. Hurry, hurry, hurry! BFN :-)

183
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:14,120
Mr Williams didn't understand anything. He
looked at Belinda, who was still crying. "Belinda,

184
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,030
please, stop crying for just one minute and
call Mike. Tell him to come here at once.

185
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,189
We need his help."

186
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:30,179
She looked at him in amazement and replied,
"But Mr Williams, you sacked Mike about an

187
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,230
hour ago. Don't you remember?"

188
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,350
Yes, now he did remember. There was no one
to help him.

189
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:43,820
His headache was getting worse. He couldn't
think. Then Belinda's voice came from behind

190
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,080
his chair. "Why don't you call your son, Robbie?
He's very good with computers, isn't he?"

191
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,390
Mr Williams got up and hugged her. "Yes! Belinda,
you're fantastic. Why didn't I think of that?"

192
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,720
It was a school holiday so Robbie would be
in his bedroom, playing on the computer and

193
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,210
listening to music but definitely not studying.
It was rare to see an open textbook in that

194
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,450
bedroom. There were two things Mr Williams
always associated with his son - his mobile

195
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:19,470
phone and his baseball cap. Mr Williams picked
up the phone and dialled his home number.

196
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,539
"Robbie? This is your father. Listen, I have
a problem with the computers at the bank.

197
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:32,240
Can you come and help me? I don't care if
you're fighting Lara Croft. This is really

198
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,720
important. Come as soon as possible please.
Thank you."

199
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,240
Mr Williams put down the phone and smiled.
"That was a great idea of yours, Belinda.

200
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,590
Robbie's a teenager so I'm sure he'll understand
all the strange symbols and abbreviations

201
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,299
in the puzzle."

202
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:54,299
Belinda blushed. "If I could make another
suggestion, Mr Williams? I think you can see

203
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,620
where the e-mail came from. Look at the top
of the page."

204
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,980
She was right. "Well done again, Belinda!
It was sent from the local library. So, our

205
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,980
mystery hacker thinks he's clever, does he?"

206
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,700
Mr Williams picked up the phone again. This
time he called the security office.

207
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,480
He explained the situation and told the head
of security to send two guards to the library

208
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,169
to find and arrest the hacker.

209
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,690
He was feeling a little bit better and Belinda
had stopped crying. Then he noticed something

210
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,870
appear on the computer screen. It was a clock
icon and an hourglass. Fifteen minutes had

211
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,220
already passed and the sand was falling.

212
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:49,740
The countdown had begun...

213
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,080
CHAPTER SIX
Trouble in the Library

214
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,570
It was only 9.30 but there were already a
lot of people inside the library; some were

215
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,980
looking for a bestseller on the bookshelves,
others were reading the newspapers or books

216
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,840
in the study area and a few were using the
photocopying machine and the computers. A

217
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,460
man was reading the messages on a big notice-board.
A mother and her child were going upstairs

218
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,240
to the children's section.

219
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,220
A librarian was pushing a trolley of books.
It was very quiet.

220
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,700
In the library anyone who had to speak, spoke
quietly. The librarians were there to help

221
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,600
anyone who had a problem.

222
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,630
This was the scene when Bill and Ben, the
two security guards from the bank, arrived

223
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,440
to investigate. They walked to the desk where
a librarian was helping an old lady.

224
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,990
"We believe that a criminal has sent an e-mail
message from a computer in this library and

225
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:51,200
we want to see the list of people who have
used the Internet this morning," said Bill.

226
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,580
The librarian calmly replied, "I'm sorry but
I'm busy now. If you would like to wait, I'll

227
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,260
be happy to help you as soon as I can."

228
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,860
Ben was not a patient man. "I don't think
you understand, madam. We are here to arrest

229
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,940
a criminal and we want to do it now!" he shouted.

230
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,520
The old lady, who was in front of Ben, was
angry and she hit both guards with her handbag.

231
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,730
"Hey, I was here first! You are very rude
men!" she said. The librarian tried to calm

232
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,490
everyone down. She said to the men, "Please
don't shout. This is a library. I'm afraid

233
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,570
we can only give information about the people
who use our library to the police. Are you

234
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,390
policemen?" Bill replied, "No, we're security
guards from the bank on London Road and we..."

235
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:44,020
The librarian interrupted him, "Then I can't
help you. Now, will you please leave the library?"

236
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:50,520
But the men didn't want to leave. Bill had
an idea. "Hey, Ben, maybe the hacker is still

237
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,520
using the computer. Let's go and see."

238
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,150
They ran to the computer area and began to
question the four people who were using the

239
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,840
computers. Now everyone in the library, including
the librarians, came to watch.

240
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,620
The guards were shouting and the people at
the computers were frightened.

241
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,000
Mr Page, the head librarian, came out of his
office to see why there was all this noise

242
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,440
in his usually quiet library. The scene he
saw shocked him. He walked to the computer

243
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,840
area and demanded to know what was happening.

244
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,570
About twenty people answered him at the same
time so it was impossible to understand. But

245
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,720
he soon realized that the two men dressed
in blue uniforms were causing the problem

246
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,710
and were disturbing everyone.

247
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,700
He shouted, "You two, get out of my library
now!" And with the help of some people in

248
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,960
the library, he pushed them to the door and
then out of the library and into the street.

249
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,850
"And don't come back!" yelled the old lady,
furiously. All the people in the library were

250
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,780
talking about what had just happened.

251
00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:07,980
Nobody noticed a man who was hiding behind
the shelves. He was laughing...

252
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,340
CHAPTER SEVEN
Robbie the Hero

253
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,330
- Robbie Williams arrived at the bank a few
minutes after the phone conversation with

254
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,059
his father. He wasn't very happy. It was the
school holidays and he wanted to go out with

255
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:28,310
his friends but his mother told him at least
ten times a day to open a textbook and study.

256
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,711
Today he had wanted to buy a new football
scarf and a computer game but instead he had

257
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:39,010
to help his father at the bank! He went inside
and up the stairs to the office.

258
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,450
"Hey, Dad, what's up? I have to meet my friends
at the shopping centre at lunchtime. I'm going

259
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,529
to buy a new computer game. It's wicked. It's
called..." Mr Williams interrupted his son.

260
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,470
"Robbie, please, take those headphones off
and listen to me." He quickly explained the

261
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,900
problem of the hacker. Robbie couldn't believe
it.

262
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,710
"Bad luck, Dad. How can I help?"

263
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,770
Mr Williams showed him the first puzzle. Robbie
gave his father a big smile.

264
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,960
"Relax, Dad. This is so easy I can do it with
my eyes shut! I use these abbreviations every

265
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,600
day when I'm in a chat room or when I text
my friends on my mobile phone. I'll show you.

266
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:28,200
WU stands for 'What's up?' I C stands for
'I see.' And these symbols are called 'emoticons.'

267
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,370
They look like a face and they express the
way you feel. I can easily decode this message

268
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,750
for you." Robbie sat down, clicked on the
reply icon and wrote out the message:

269
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:55,390
What's up Henry? I see you are sad. Why? You
can't see me. You are sad but I am angry.

270
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:06,340
In my opinion you are surprised or perhaps
afraid. That's all for now. I'll be back later.

271
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
End Of Message Have a nice day (laughing out
loud) Bye for now!

272
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,570
"See? I told you it was easy. Now I'll click
on 'Send' and the message will go back to

273
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:21,560
the sender." Mr Williams thanked his son and
slowly he began to relax... but for how long?

274
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,580
It was now 10.15. Only one hour had passed.
Belinda came into the office and said to her

275
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
boss,

276
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,659
"The ATM is working again..." Mr Williams
smiled. "But," she added quickly, "it's giving

277
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,230
the customers too much money..."

278
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:41,669
Mr Williams tell back into his chair. Why
was life so difficult?

279
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:47,880
The security guards Bill and Ben knocked at
the door and came into his office. Did they

280
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,230
have some good news for him?

281
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,799
"Well?" he asked hopefully. "Did you find
him?"

282
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,510
Bill answered, "Not exactly, Mr Williams.
We tried but the people at the library were

283
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,750
very unfriendly."

284
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:03,690
"Yes," added Ben. "They didn't want to help
us and in the end they asked us to leave.

285
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,380
There was an old lady who..." Mr Williams
was angry.

286
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,950
"I'm not interested in the old lady. You obviously
didn't catch the hacker. You are both completely

287
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,600
incompetent. Now go back to your office before
I sack you."

288
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,059
His headache had returned, worse than ever.
Then his son said, "Dad, look. There's another

289
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,350
message from the hacker." He looked at Robbie
and then at Belinda. Then they all looked

290
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:40,580
at the screen...

291
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,800
CHAPTER EIGHT
My Name is Trentine

292
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,179
Hello Henry,

293
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:54,450
Well, that was an easy puzzle. I imagine someone
helped you - your son Robbie perhaps? He's

294
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,400
intelligent but your security guards are really
stupid.

295
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:07,090
They didn't see me at the library but I saw
them! Never mind! Maybe they'll have better

296
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:18,419
luck next time... Here's your second puzzle
- impossible, I think. Have fun! BFN

297
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,200
Puzzle Number Two

298
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:34,200
My name is TRENTINE - I am power and knowledge.
These are my friends:

300
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:45,370
Henry Williams wasn't very worried. He had
his secret weapon - Robbie!

301
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:51,960
"You can solve this puzzle too, can't you,
Robbie?" he asked. Then he saw his son's face.

302
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,410
"Dad, I'm really sorry but I don't understand
it. But, look - the hacker sent it from the

303
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,700
Internet Cafe in the city centre."

304
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,510
Belinda was crying again. Mr Williams phoned
the security office for the second time that

305
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:15,090
day and told Bill and Ben to go to the Internet
Cafe to find the hacker. As soon as he put

306
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,929
down the phone, a bank teller came into his
office with more bad news.

307
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:23,960
"A customer has just told me that the bank's
website is advertising a special offer - a

308
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,910
credit card with 0% interest. Is it true?"
he asked.

309
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,210
"Of course it isn't!" yelled Mr Williams.
"Don't give any new credit cards to any of

310
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,730
our customers! Now go back to work!"

311
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:42,790
The teller disappeared. The minutes became
hours and Mr Williams became more and more

312
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:49,280
agitated. Robbie continued to look at the
puzzle perplexed, and Belinda continued to

313
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,429
cry. Suddenly Robbie had an idea. "I know
what to do!" he shouted.

314
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,390
His father jumped up. "Have you solved the
puzzle?'" he asked.

315
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:04,350
"No, but I bet my friend Joe can help us.
I'll send him a text message on his mobile."

316
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,890
Mr Williams sat down again while Robbie sent
the message.

317
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,010
Come to Bank Now. Rob

318
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,500
When Joe arrived it was already 5 o'clock.

319
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,590
"What's up, Robbie?" he asked. Then he saw
Belinda, who smiled at him. He smiled back.

320
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,309
Wow! She was beautiful! He immediately fell
in love with her.

321
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:30,660
"Joe, listen to me," said Robbie. He explained
about the hacker and showed Joe the second

322
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,730
puzzle. Joe didn't want to take his eyes off
Belinda but he had to look at the computer

323
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,820
screen. Mr Williams was beginning to panic.

324
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,610
"Hurry, boys. There isn't much time left."

325
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:48,059
"Take it easy, Mr W. We can solve this. Come
on, Robbie. Let's do it."

326
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:57,280
After four long hours they solved the puzzle.
"So, who is Trentine?" asked Mr Williams.

327
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,540
"The Internet," replied Joe.

328
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,440
"Of course," said Robbie. "And the friends
are all words connected with the Internet

329
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,710
- browser, e-mail, world wide web, chat room
and..."

330
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,760
"Surf," said Belinda happily.

331
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,830
Joe looked at her. "Belinda, you are so cool.
You're the perfect girl tor me," he said as

332
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,670
he clicked on the "Send" icon.

333
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,809
Mr Williams looked at them and said to himself:
"What are they talking about? I think I'm

334
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:28,630
getting old."

335
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:34,470
It was nine o'clock. The hourglass was half-empty
but they had solved the puzzle in time. Mr

336
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,260
Williams was very relieved. The situation
was improving at last. At that moment the

337
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:57,919
telephone rang. When Mr Williams answered
he heard a voice say: "Good evening. This

338
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,549
is the police..."

339
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:09,039
CHAPTER NINE
A Surprise for Henry

340
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,570
Mr Williams put down the phone. He said, "That
was the police. It seems that Bill and Ben

341
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,559
created a disturbance at the Internet Cafe
and they have been arrested. They didn't catch

342
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,850
the hacker, of course. Why doesn't that surprise
me? Well, they can stay at the police station

343
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,100
until we find the hacker." There was no reply
from the others. Robbie was sending a text

344
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,880
message on his mobile phone to his friends
to say why he hadn't met them that afternoon.

345
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,679
Joe was talking to Belinda.

346
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,760
"Will you go out with me tonight, Belinda?
There's a great hamburger place near here."

347
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,299
Belinda smiled at him.

348
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:47,610
"But you're only 15, Joe. I'm too old for
you."

349
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:53,149
"I'm very mature for my age," he replied quickly.
"Come on! We'll have a fantastic time. I'll

350
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:56,820
pay and..." Their conversation was interrupted
by the hacker.

351
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,370
Congratulations, Henry. You've solved the
second Puzzle. I suppose Robbie helped you

352
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:12,220
again. It's a pity those security guards aren't
as intelligent as your son. They failed again,

353
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,370
didn't they? Henry, there's still another
puzzle to solve. If you solve it, you will

354
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:26,990
discover my identity. I'll send the Message
later. First, you need to relax and... cool

355
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,029
down. Are you ready for a surprise?

356
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,380
BFN

357
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,380
"A surprise. What does that mean, Mr Williams'"
asked Belinda.

358
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,269
"I have no idea but I'm sure we'll soon find
out," replied her boss.

359
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:49,990
All the staff had gone home at 5 o'clock as
usual. The offices were silent. He was suddenly

360
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,919
very tired. His eyes began to close...

361
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:00,450
He was on holiday in the Caribbean. He was
on the beach. It was hot and sunny. There

362
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:06,200
were no clouds in the sky. It was too hot
so he went swimming in the sea to cool down.

363
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,770
He was wet, very wet... Mr Williams woke up.
He was wet! Was it raining in his office?

364
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,970
He heard Belinda's voice:

365
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:22,830
"Mr Williams, what's happening? I'm all wet.
Where is the water coming from? My hair and

366
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,820
clothes are ruined!"

367
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,850
Mr Williams answered, "This is our surprise,
Belinda. Our friend the hacker has started

368
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,980
the sprinkler system. Very funny. Let's get
out of here."

369
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,390
They all ran out of the office and went downstairs.
Joe tried to console Belinda, and Robbie wanted

370
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,020
to know if he could go home.

371
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,850
"Please, Dad. It's late and I want to watch
TV tonight."

372
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,220
"Not yet," replied his father. "We still have
another puzzle to solve."

373
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,070
"What do you mean 'we,' Dad? You haven't done
anything yet," replied his son sarcastically.

374
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:05,750
Mr Williams looked at his son but he knew
that Robbie was right. The boys had solved

375
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,350
the first two puzzles.

376
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:18,909
In the distance they heard 
a siren. Was it the police? Mr Williams and

377
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:35,250
Robbie went to the doors of the bank. Slowly
Mr Williams opened the door...

378
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,160
CHAPTER TEN
Where's the Fire?

379
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,250
Mr Williams opened the door and three firemen
ran into the hank.

380
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,970
"OK, where's the fire?" they said. Mr Williams
was very confused.

381
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:53,230
"What do you mean, 'fire'? There's no fire
here. I think you've made a mistake."

382
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,160
The firemen were not convinced. "Mr Williams,
have you forgotten that the bank's sprinkler

383
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,310
system is connected to the alarm at the tire
station? The sprinklers started, the alarm

384
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,040
sounded and we came here to put out the fire.
Now, where is it?" This time Robbie spoke.

385
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,280
"There is no fire. The sprinklers started
because there must be a problem with the system."

386
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,050
"Yes," added Mr Williams. "I'm so sorry that
you've come here for nothing."

387
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:25,540
"Well, I must say I can't see any fire. We'll
come back tomorrow morning to check if there's

388
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,780
some kind of problem with the sprinklers,"
the fireman replied. "You're working very

389
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,580
late tonight, Mr Williams," he added.

390
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:40,329
"Yes, we have a lot to do," came the tired
reply. When they had gone, Mr Williams told

391
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:45,240
Belinda that she could go home. He opened
the door for her and Robbie tried to go out

392
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,150
at the same time. His father pulled him back.

393
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,280
"I need you here," he said. "Let's go back
to the office."

394
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,839
"Oh, Dad," Robbie protested but he followed
his father upstairs.

395
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:06,190
It was four o'clock in the morning when the
final puzzle arrived. Robbie and Joe were

396
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,980
sleeping on the floor. They had been too tired
to stay awake. Henry Williams forced himself

397
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,930
to look at the computer screen.

398
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,010
Hi, Henry. Here's the final puzzle.

399
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,690
You have to read these sentences about a famous
person and find the four words.

400
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,980
Puzzle Number Three

401
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:34,359
The first word is his first but it's your
second. The second word is a barrier but also

402
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:44,369
a way to enter. The third word is the baby,
or is it a monster? The fourth word is where

403
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,369
it all began.

404
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:54,900
Now take the first letter of each word, then
add the letters I and A. You now have six

405
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,480
letters and in these letters you will find
my name.

406
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
BFN

407
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,800
It was incredible. A few hours ago everything
was fine. Now someone wanted to destroy his

408
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,640
bank and his life. Why? He touched Robbie
gently and said, "Robbie, wake up! The last

409
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,010
puzzle has arrived. We've only got a few hours
to solve it." There was no response from his

410
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:28,070
son, who continued to sleep. Mr Williams tried
to wake Joe, but Joe simply mumbled in his

411
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:36,720
sleep, "Belinda, do you want a hamburger or
a cheeseburger?" Mr Williams sat with his

412
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,890
head in his hands. The boys were sleeping
and he couldn't wake them. What was he going

413
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:50,010
to do? He looked at the clock again - it was
already four thirty! Then another e-mail arrived.

414
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,280
Come on, Henry. Admit it. You've lost.

415
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:03,760
Soon I will start to empty the bank accounts.
Who shall I choose first? Perhaps the police

416
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,990
station? OR maybe I'll choose Mrs Miller,
the poor old lady from the library. No, I

417
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:20,700
think I'll start with the Town Council - it's
the end of the month and wages must be paid.

418
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:32,930
Was the hacker right? Was this the end...?

419
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,230
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Is It the End?

420
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:43,349
At 8.30 Mr Williams opened his eyes. For a
moment he didn't remember the events of the

421
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:49,820
previous day. Then slowly his mind formed
a picture of a computer hacker and some strange

422
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:54,750
puzzles. He wondered if he had dreamt it all.
Then he saw Robbie and Joe, who were still

423
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,300
asleep on the floor and he saw the computer
screen. The final puzzle was still there and

424
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,040
the hourglass was almost empty. It wasn't
a nightmare; it was real!

425
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,200
The door of the office opened and Belinda
came in. "Oh, Mr Williams. Have you been here

426
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,820
all night? And poor Robbie and Joe too. Did
you find the solution to the last puzzle?"

427
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,579
She saw his expression and already knew the
answer. "I'll make you a nice cup of tea and

428
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:27,339
you'll soon feel better," she said.

429
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:33,880
There were only thirty minutes left. Mr Williams
was angry with himself. He felt responsible

430
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,790
for everything. His bank was in danger and
he couldn't save it. He tried to wake Robbie

431
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,440
again but it was difficult to wake his teenage
son before midday! Belinda returned with the

432
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,470
tea. Mr Williams drank three cups.

433
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:54,340
He looked out of his window. The bank teller
were arriving for another day's work - maybe

434
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:01,010
the last day. What could he tell them? In
desperation he sat down in front of the computer

435
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:07,060
again. "Belinda, if we win, I promise that
I will learn about computers and become an

436
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,460
expert. My son is only 15 and he knows much
more than me. I'm living in the past and I

437
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,500
have to change."

438
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,480
"That's a wonderful idea, Mr Williams. And
of course, I'll help you as much as possible.

439
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,200
I know a lot of things now and..."

440
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,060
She didn't finish her sentence because Mr
Williams shouted so loudly that Robbie and

441
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:33,099
Joe woke up. "That's it! I've found the solution!
I know the answer to the puzzle!"

442
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:39,420
Robbie and Joe got up right away. They looked
at one another and then at Mr Williams. Robbie

443
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,300
said hesitantly, "Are you sure Dad? It looks
impossible to me."

444
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:50,340
"Yes, of course I'm sure. I've done it. Now,
first I click on the reply icon, right? And

445
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:57,310
then I write the answers. The first word is
Bill - it's the man's first name and the abbreviation

446
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:04,560
of my second name, Williams. The second word
is gate. It's a barrier and a way to enter."

447
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,370
"So the man is Bill Gates," said Joe.

448
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:17,800
"Exactly," replied Mr Williams. "The third
word is Microsoft - his baby, his creation,

449
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,010
but also a monster in the opinion of some
people. And the last word is Seattle. That's

450
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:30,420
where Bill Gates lives and where he started
Microsoft, the beginning."

451
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,369
"That's brilliant Dad. Well done!" said Robbie.

452
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:41,940
"Now," continued Mr Williams, "if we take
the first letter of each word we have B, G,

453
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:50,540
M, and S. We have to add two more letters
- I and A - and these six letters should spell

454
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,240
the name of the hacker." Everyone looked at
the six letters:

455
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,960
B G M S I A

456
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:05,460
They tried to see a name but they could only
see words like big and bags but no names.

457
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:21,049
Then suddenly Mr Williams jumped up and yelled,
"Yes! Yes! I know the name of the hacker..."

458
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:25,000
CHAPTER TWELVE
A Holiday for Someone

459
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,250
"Sam Gib," said Mr Williams. "I don't believe
it. But why does he hate me?"

460
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:38,890
"Maybe because you sacked him two weeks ago,"
suggested Belinda. Robbie asked, "Who's Sam

461
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,579
Gib?" Mr Williams explained, "He used to work
here at the bank. In the beginning he was

462
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,520
a good bank teller. Then he started to arrive
late for work every day. Instead of working

463
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,280
he used to surf the net and log on to chat
rooms. He spent hours talking to people all

464
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,970
over the world. So I sacked him. But wait
a minute. If he left two weeks ago, how did

465
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,150
he know the new computer passwords?"

466
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,839
Belinda had the answer to his question.

467
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:12,930
"He came back to the bank a few days ago to
empty his desk. I think you were in a meeting.

468
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:17,290
I remember that he went to Mike's office and
stayed there for a long time. I thought he

469
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:23,240
was talking to Mike, but now I think about
it Mike wasn't there all the time. Anyway,

470
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,380
Mr Williams, you're a hero. You've saved the
bank!"

471
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,220
"Yes, and there are only two minutes left.
Look, it's 9.13," said Joe.

472
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:39,910
They all looked at the computer screen. Suddenly
Robbie said, "Dad, did you remember to click

473
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:45,440
on the 'send' icon to return the message to
the hacker, I mean, Sam Gib?"

474
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,950
"Oh, no! Quickly, click, CLICK before it's
too late!" shouted Mr Williams. Four hands

475
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:57,000
tried to operate the mouse but in the confusion
it fell on the floor. Finally Robbie picked

476
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,650
up the mouse, clicked and the message disappeared.
For a moment nobody spoke. Then they all began

477
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:03,630
laughing and hugging each another.

478
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:10,910
"We've won! We've won, you've won, Dad," said
Robbie while Joe hugged Belinda again. Mr

479
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,990
Williams went downstairs to give the good
news to the staff, who also laughed and applauded

480
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:23,180
their boss. When Mr Williams returned to his
office he picked up the phone.

481
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,850
"Now I can call the police and tell them everything
and they can go to Sam's house and arrest

482
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:31,410
him." But before he could do it, another e-mail
arrived.

483
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,410
Hello Henry

484
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:40,310
Now you know who I am. Congratulations!

485
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:45,910
Did you enjoy playing my game?

486
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,100
When you sacked me I wanted my revenge so
I sent the virus that infected the bank's

487
00:44:50,100 --> 00:45:00,829
computers. But it wasn't enough. You installed
a new computer system so I came to visit Mike

488
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:08,650
and saw the new passwords on his desk. It
was so easy. You really need to improve security

489
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,650
at the bank. Maybe I can help you?

490
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,900
But Henry, I still have a surprise for you...

491
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,780
This time Mr Williams went white.

492
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,869
"Oh please no! Not another puzzle!" he cried.

493
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:32,190
I think I need a holiday. As you booked your
holiday to the Caribbean on the net, I changed

494
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,710
the address and the tickets arrived at my
house instead of your house yesterday. I also

495
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:46,730
changed the date of the holiday and I'm leaving
at 10.00 today. I'm sending this message from

496
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:54,380
the airport on my new laptop. To show you
that I am a kind person, I have returned all

497
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,099
the money to your bank account.

498
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:02,070
Thanks for the holiday. Maybe we can play
another game when I come back...
