00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,480
The Damned Thing

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,840
It was night. Eight men were sitting 
together in an empty room of a small house.  

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,640
The only pieces of furniture were a simple 
wooden table and eight chairs. The only light  

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,080
came from a lamp on the table. 
One of the men was reading a book.  

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,560
He held the book close to the lamp, so 
that he could see the words on the pages.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
There was a ninth man in the room.  

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:45,920
He owned the house. He was lying on the table, 
beneath a white sheet. The ninth man was dead.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,040
It was quiet in the house. Outside, there 
were the sounds of birds and insects in the  

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:03,440
trees around the house. Visitors from the city 
always noticed these strange cries and calls.  

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:13,760
But the men in the room took no notice of these 
sounds. They heard them every day. Seven of the  

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:22,800
men were farmers and woodsmen. They worked in the 
fields and forests every day of the year. The skin  

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:30,400
on their faces had been burned by the sun and the 
wind. They were wearing hats with broad brims.

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
The man with the book did not look like the 
others. He was not wearing a broad-brimmed hat.  

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,480
His face was smooth, intelligent and handsome.  

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,760
He looked like an educated, 
important man. He was a coroner.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,000
All of the men were here this evening to do an 
important job. An inquest was taking place in the  

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,800
room. The men had come to look at the dead body 
on the table. They had to answer this question:  

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,320
How did this man die?

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,840
The coroner was reading a diary. 
It belonged to the dead man.  

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,080
The coroner and the seven men were waiting for 
a witness to attend the dead man's inquest.

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Suddenly, they heard the sound of a horse 
galloping on the road. Someone was riding  

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,280
quickly toward the house. The horse stopped 
outside, the door opened and a young man came in.

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,760
"I'm late. I'm sorry," he said.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
"We've been waiting for you," said the 
coroner. "We must finish this job tonight.  

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,040
Hugh Morgan must be buried tomorrow 
morning. Where have you been?"

26
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,840
"I went to the telegraph office and sent a 
telegram," said the young man. "I've written  

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,280
a report about Hugh Morgan's death. The report 
will be in the San Francisco newspapers tomorrow.  

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm a reporter. I write 
stories for the newspapers."

29
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,280
"You're not here to tell us a newspaper story," 
said the coroner. "You're here to tell us what  

30
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,840
happened to Mr Morgan. You must tell the 
truth. You must swear that you'll do this."

31
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,240
"Yes. I'll tell you the truth," said the 
young man. "Rut you might not believe me."

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,160
"That isn't a good beginning," said the coroner.  

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
"Is your newspaper report different from 
the story that you're going to tell us?"

34
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
For a moment, the young man had 
an angry expression on his face.  

35
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,480
"I've come here to tell you what really happened," 
he said. "I promise that I'll tell you the truth.  

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,560
Everything that I say to you will be true. 
You can read what I wrote for the newspaper.  

37
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:42,240
These are the true facts. This is what I saw 
and heard and did. The report isn't fiction."

38
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
"Let's begin," said the coroner.

39
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
The men took off their hats.  

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
The young man lifted his right hand 
and began to speak slowly and clearly.

41
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,840
"I swear before God. I will tell the truth, the 
whole truth and nothing but the truth," he said.

42
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,200
"What is your name?" asked the coroner.

43
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
"William Harker."

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,280
"Age?"

45
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,280
"Twenty-seven."

46
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
"Did you know the dead man, Hugh Morgan?"

47
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
"Yes, I did."

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
"Were you with him when he died?"

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
"I was near him."

50
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:44,320
"Tell us what happened," said the coroner. "Why 
were you with Mr Morgan, and what did you see?"

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,600
"I was visiting him," said Harker. "Morgan and 
I were good friends. I live in San Francisco,  

52
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,440
but I often came here to stay with Morgan. 
We hunted birds and animals in the forest,  

53
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,440
and we caught fish in the rivers. Morgan and I 
went hunting and fishing together many times."

54
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,840
"Tell us what happened on the day that 
Mr Morgan died," said the coroner.

55
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,360
"We left this house at sunrise," said Harker.  

56
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,840
"We wanted to hunt quails. We took Morgan's 
dog with us and we both carried shotguns.  

57
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Morgan told me, 'There's a field of wild oats over 
the hill. There are many good, large quails there.  

58
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:53,520
They'll be good to eat.' So we went to the field. 
But we found something bigger than quails."

59
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,000
"What do you mean?" asked the 
coroner. "Did you find an animal?"

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,800
"Yes-er-no," said Harker. "I don't know what kind 
of animal it was. But I saw the oats moving in the  

61
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:24,320
field. Something was coming toward us. I couldn't 
see the animal, but I guessed that it was big.  

62
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,240
Morgan didn't say anything. He lifted 
his gun and aimed it at the oats."

63
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,160
Harker stopped speaking and 
looked toward the window.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,760
"Please continue, Mr Harker," said 
the coroner. "What happened next?"

65
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,120
"I pointed at the moving plants," replied 
Harker. "I said, 'Morgan! If that's a deer,  

66
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,440
you won't be able to kill it with a 
shotgun. You'll need a more powerful gun-a  

67
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:13,120
rifle. But maybe it's something bigger than a 
deer. It might be a bear, or a mountain lion!'  

68
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:25,840
But Morgan didn't reply. He just aimed his gun 
at the oats and stared. I began to be afraid.  

69
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,440
Our shotguns wouldn't stop 
an angry bear or a lion."

70
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,320
"Mr Harker, you say that it was a big animal,"  

71
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,880
said the coroner. "Do you know the difference 
between a bear and a lion and a deer?"

72
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,600
"Yes, I do, sir," said the young man quickly 
and angrily. "And that's the strangest part  

73
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,840
of this story. I saw the oats moving. And I 
heard something coming through the plants.  

74
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:13,680
But I couldn't see what it was. A big thing 
was moving toward us, but I couldn't see it."

75
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:25,040
"Did you speak to Mr Morgan again?" asked 
the coroner. "Yes," said Harker. "I shouted,  

76
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:34,400
'What is it?' But Morgan didn't reply. 
The animal-or thing-was coming closer  

77
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:46,000
and Morgan got ready to fire his gun. Suddenly he 
said, 'It's that Damned Thing!' He was terrified."

78
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:56,800
"Did Mr Morgan know what it was?" asked the 
coroner. "Is that what you believe, Mr Harker?"

79
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,760
"Yes, sir," Harker replied. "I believe 
that Morgan had seen it before.  

80
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:17,840
Then he fired his gun and I heard a terrible 
sound. It was the scream of a wild animal."

81
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,480
"And did you fire your gun 
too?" asked the coroner.

82
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:34,480
"No, I didn't. I couldn't," replied Harker. "The 
smoke from Morgan's gun was in my eyes. I couldn't  

83
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:43,200
see where to aim my own gun. Then, suddenly, 
Morgan dropped his gun and started to run."

84
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
"He left you ?" asked the coroner.

85
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,080
"Well, I was surprised," said Harker. 
"But I didn't have time to think about it.  

86
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Something knocked me to the ground."

87
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,760
"What knocked you down?" asked the coroner.

88
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:13,840
"Well, I didn't see it. But it was 
soft and heavy. It moved very fast."

89
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
"And then what happened?"

90
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:28,240
"I heard wild screams near me. They were like 
the sounds made by dogs who are fighting. Then  

91
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,840
I saw that Morgan was fighting. He was on 
the ground. He was fighting for his life."

92
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,840
"Fighting what?" asked the coroner.

93
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:54,080
"I-I don't know," said the young man. "I couldn't 
see anything, or anyone. But Morgan was on the  

94
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:02,000
ground and there was a strange movement in the 
air around him. I don't know how to describe it.  

95
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,320
It seemed as if the fight was happening 
under water. Sometimes I couldn't see  

96
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:19,040
one of Morgan's hands. Sometimes his head 
disappeared. Then his whole body moved again."

97
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,160
"And did you try to help Mr 
Morgan?" asked the coroner.

98
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
"Of course I did.  

99
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,720
I ran toward him. But I found him like this..." 
Harker pointed to the dead body on the table.

100
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,760
"And where was the animal?" asked the coroner.

101
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,640
"I don't know. I only saw the oats moving again.  

102
00:12:51,760 --> 00:13:00,000
They moved as if there was wind blowing 
across them. The thing- whatever it was-went  

103
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:09,120
into the woods. My friend was dead. I 
came into town to get a police officer."

104
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,080
"Very well," said the coroner, 
"we'll examine the body."

105
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,320
He lifted the white sheet off Morgan's 
body. Then he removed a handkerchief that  

106
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,880
was tied around the dead man's head. The 
handkerchief kept Morgan's mouth closed.  

107
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,200
The other men looked closely. 
One of them held the lamp high.

108
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
Its light shone on the body of the dead man.

109
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,960
Hugh Morgan's throat had been 
torn open. There were many  

110
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,200
terrible deep injuries all over his 
body. His clothes were soaked with blood.

111
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:06,640
"Gentlemen, you've heard Mr Harker's story," 
said the coroner. "You've seen Mr Morgan's body.  

112
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,480
What shall we write on the death certificate?  

113
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,960
Did a wild animal kill Mr Morgan, 
or was he murdered? We must decide."

114
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,920
The seven men went out of the room and spoke 
together quietly for two or three minutes.

115
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
William Harker turned toward the coroner.

116
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,960
"I see that you have Morgan's diary, 
sir," he said. "Have you read it?  

117
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Does it tell us anything important?"

118
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,960
"I've read it quickly," said the coroner,  

119
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,960
"No, it doesn't tell us anything 
about the cause of Mr Morgan's death."

120
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,000
The seven men came back into the room. One of 
them stood in front of the coroner and spoke.

121
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,320
"We believe that Hugh Morgan was 
killed by a mountain lion," he said.

122
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,360
"Thank you, gentlemen," said the 
coroner. "Everyone can leave now.  

123
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,840
Mr Morgan will be buried in the 
morning. I'll send for an undertaker."

124
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,440
That was the end of the inquest. But 
it was not quite the end of the story.

125
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,000
William Harker was a writer. He 
wanted to read Hugh Morgan's diary  

126
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,960
and write a story about his friend's death. 
He stayed in the town after Morgan was buried.  

127
00:15:52,240 --> 00:16:00,480
A few days later, Morgan's property and belongings 
were sold. William Harker bought the diary.

128
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:09,520
Hugh Morgan had been a lonely man who had written 
all his thoughts in his diary. But he had not  

129
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,920
always written days and dates in the diary. 
And some of the pages in the book were torn.  

130
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,520
Other pages were missing. This is what 
Morgan had written before his death:

131
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,920
My dog is behaving strangely. He barks and turns 
around again and again. He looks at something that  

132
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:44,000
isn't there. He runs after something that he 
can't see. This has happened several times.
 
 

133
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,880
1 September

134
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:56,560
Tonight, I was looking at the stars in the sky 
above the hill. Then something strange happened.  

135
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,880
Someone-or something-moved between 
me and the stars. The stars  

136
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,480
suddenly looked like a pool when you drop 
a stone in the water. Am I going crazy?
 
 

137
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,160
27 September

138
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:27,440
It's been here again. It moves around the 
house. Now I keep my gun beside me always.  

139
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:37,040
Does this Thing only come at night? Today 
I saw footprints in the soft ground,  

140
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:46,080
near the house. What's happening 
here? Am I going crazy?
 
 

141
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,120
2 October

142
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,600
I shall not leave my home. I will 
not run away because of this Thing.  

143
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
But it might make me crazy.
 
 

144
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
5 October

145
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,920
I've invited my friend, Harker, 
to stay here. I'll say nothing.  

146
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,960
Maybe he'll find an answer. 
Maybe he'll see the Thing too.

147
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:30,400
Can the dog see it? I'm sure that the dog hears 
it. It hears things that I can't hear. Can the dog  

148
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:40,720
see things that I can't see? Perhaps that is the 
answer. If there are sounds that men can't hear,  

149
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:52,240
are there colors that men can't see? Is the 
Damned Thing a color that men can't see?

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,864
- THE END -
