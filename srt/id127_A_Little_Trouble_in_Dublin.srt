CHAPTER ONE
Funny money

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,990
'Isn't it beautiful?' said Andy Lawson to
his sister, Mary.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,850
'No,' replied Mary.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,360
'It's not beautiful and it's not interesting.'

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,240
Andrew Lawson, always called Andy, looked
at his sister.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,750
She was thirteen and he was thirteen.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,020
They were twins - but they were not the same.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:39,810
He was 170 centimetres tall with short red
hair and blue eyes.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:48,270
She was only 160 centimetres tall with long
dark hair and big brown eyes.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,590
They didn't look the same and they didn't
think the same.

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,910
'Mary,' said Andy.

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,400
'Look at it.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,380
It's over a thousand years old.

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,360
Half a million people come here every year.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,360
They want to see this because it is very old
and very famous.'

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,759
Andy and Mary were in the city of Dublin in
Ireland.

17
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,810
Actually, they were in Trinity College in
Dublin and in front of them was the Book of

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:30,010
Kells, 680 pages of words and pictures, and
over a thousand years old.

19
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,950
'Well, I don't think it's beautiful,' said
Mary.

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,810
'I'm going to the shop.'

21
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,530
And she walked away.

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,890
The shop was in the next room.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,729
Mary looked round.

24
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:53,820
There were books and CDs about the Book of
Kells, and there were Trinity College T-shirts.

25
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,310
Mary looked at the T-shirts.

26
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,729
'I like these,' she thought.

27
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:02,539
'And they're not too expensive.'

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,439
She took down a red T-shirt and got out some
money.

29
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,780
Mary waited with the money in her hand.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,569
In front of her was a big man with a green
Ireland football shirt.

31
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,349
The shirt was much too small for him and Mary
saw his stomach.

32
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,349
Yuk!

33
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,110
The man bought a postcard.

34
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,799
'I'm sorry,' he said to the shop assistant.

35
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:37,019
'I know the postcards are just 75 cents, but
I've only got this.'

36
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,330
There was a €20 note in his hand.

37
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,630
'That's OK,' replied the shop assistant.

38
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,690
Mary looked at the money in her hand.

39
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,900
It was a €50 note and a kind of orange colour.

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:06,870
In England, of course, the money was not the
same - pounds not euros.

41
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,860
The man walked away.

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,629
Mary gave the T-shirt to the shop assistant.

43
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,060
'€14.95, please,' said the shop assistant.

44
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,140
Mary gave her the €50 note.

45
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,599
The assistant put the T-shirt in a bag and
gave it to Mary.

46
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,650
Then she gave her €35.05.

47
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,340
Mary looked at the notes.

48
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:40,189
The €20 note was blue, the €10 note was
red, and the €5 note was grey.

49
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,250
She put the money in her bag.

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,360
Then Andy came into the shop.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:53,080
'You know, it is beautiful and interesting,'
he said, with a smile on his face, 'but not

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,569
for very long.

53
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,569
Come on.

54
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,970
I want an ice cream.

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,770
We've got time.

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,940
We're meeting Miss O'Brien at five o'clock
and it's only three now.'

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,400
Andy and Mary were in Dublin with students
from their school in England.

58
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,680
Their science teacher, Miss O'Brien, was from
Dublin and every year she took ten or twelve

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,760
students there at the start of the summer.

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,570
The students enjoyed seeing a new city: Dublin
is small and friendly, and there is a lot

61
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,570
to do.

62
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,030
And Miss O'Brien enjoyed seeing her family.

63
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:43,360
Andy and Mary walked to Grafton Street, one
of Dublin's important shopping streets and

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,870
found an ice cream shop.

65
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,930
Andy asked for a chocolate ice cream.

66
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,259
Mary wanted a strawberry one.

67
00:04:52,259 --> 00:05:04,530
Mary gave the shop assistant €20 and he
looked at the note.

68
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,921
Then he turned the note over and looked at
it again.

69
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,921
'I can't take this,' he said.

70
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:10,921
'Why not?' asked Mary.

71
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:15,120
'It's not a real €20 note,' he answered.

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,841
'It's forged - it's not real.

73
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,841
Look here.'

74
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:25,060
He found a new €20 note and put it on the
shop window.

75
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,460
Then he put Mary's note next to it.

76
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,009
'Look on the left of the note,' the assistant
told Mary.

77
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,560
'You can see a kind of window on the real
note, but there isn't one on yours.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,580
Yours is forged.

79
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,580
Here.'

80
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,620
He gave Mary her note.

81
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,990
'But -' Mary started to speak.

82
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,810
'Have you got some more money for your ice
creams?'

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,389
the man asked.

84
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,009
Mary found some more money.

85
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:04,400
'The police say there are a lot of those forged
notes in the city just now,' the assistant

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,660
told Mary.

87
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,620
'You need to take that one to the police station.'

88
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,010
CHAPTER TWO
The man with the forged notes

89
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,639
Out in the street again, Mary was angry.

90
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,550
She ate some ice cream, then took out the
€20 note and looked at it.

91
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,770
'A forged note!'

92
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,770
she said.

93
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,139
'Not real!

94
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,729
How can I use it now?'

95
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,020
'Listen,' said Andy.

96
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,080
'Why don't we go and tell Miss O'Brien about
it?'

97
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,430
'Good thinking,' replied Mary, and they started
walking back to their hotel on Fleet Street.

98
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,270
They got to the hotel at about a quarter to
four.

99
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,060
They found Miss O'Brien and told her about
the forged note.

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,190
Miss O'Brien looked at it.

101
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,190
Then she looked at Mary's face.

102
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,530
It was half-angry, half-sad.

103
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:14,690
'Oh, Mary,' she said and put a hand on her
shoulder.

104
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,690
'It's €20,' said Mary.

105
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:25,979
'That's a lot of money to me and now I can't
buy anything with it.'

106
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,830
'That's all right,' said Miss O'Brien.

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,919
She found her bag and opened it.

108
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,319
'Here,' she said, giving Mary a new €20
note.

109
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,060
'You have this.

110
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,430
I can call the police.'

111
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,979
She put Mary's forged note on the table in
front of her.

112
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,600
'Oh, thank you, Miss O'Brien,' said Mary happily.

113
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,650
'That is kind of you.'

114
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,439
'That's all right,' replied Miss O'Brien.

115
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,690
'Now, are you coming to the cinema this evening?'

116
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,690
'Yes,' answered Mary.

117
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,470
'I don't know,' said Andy.

118
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,789
Miss O'Brien smiled.

119
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,240
'Well, we're meeting in the hotel restaurant
at five o'clock.'

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,189
Andy and Mary went to their room and watched
television for half an hour.

121
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,860
But Mary didn't really watch.

122
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:33,910
She thought about the forged note... and the
Trinity College shop... and the man with the

123
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,450
green Ireland football shirt.

124
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,450
'Yes!' shouted Mary.

125
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,240
She turned off the television.

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,290
'Hey,' said Andy.

127
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,710
'I'm watching that.'

128
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,500
'Listen,' Mary told him.

129
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
'The man in the Trinity College shop -'

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,110
'What about him?' asked Andy.

131
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,850
'He gave the shop assistant a €20 note.

132
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,070
The forged €20 note,' answered Mary.

133
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,290
'You don't know that,' said Andy.

134
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,370
'Yes, I do,' replied Mary.

135
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,650
'He said, "This is all I've got" or something
like that.'

136
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,000
Andy said nothing.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,150
'And he's a fat man, with a green shirt,'
said Mary.

138
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,640
'And the shirt was too small.

139
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,080
I saw his stomach.'

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,940
'Yuk!' said Mary and Andy at the same time.

141
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,740
They laughed.

142
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,350
Then Andy said, 'OK.

143
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:46,350
The forged note came from a man in a green
shirt, but... how many people are there in

144
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Dublin?

145
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,390
You're not going to find him.'

146
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,290
'You're right,' replied Mary.

147
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,240
She looked angry again.

148
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,330
'There are lots of people - but I'd like to
find him.'

149
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:05,010
Andy gave her a funny look and turned the
television back on.

150
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:13,372
At a quarter to five Mary asked, 'Are you
coming to the cinema, Andy?

151
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,372
Come on.

152
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,870
The film's got some very good actors in it.'

153
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,870
'Oh!

154
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,520
All right,' said Andy and turned off the television.

155
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,380
'Anyway, who are these very good actors?'

156
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:33,110
They went down to the hotel restaurant and
Mary told Andy a little about the film.

157
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,030
Mary stopped near the restaurant.

158
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,250
She put her hand on Andy's arm.

159
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,250
'Stop!'

160
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
she said.

161
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,250
'Look!'

162
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,180
At the front of the hotel was a fat man in
a green shirt.

163
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,780
'That's him,' said Mary quietly.

164
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,730
'Mr Green Shirt.'

165
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,260
Mr Green Shirt had a big box in his hands.

166
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,480
He gave the box to the hotel receptionist
and said something.

167
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,010
The receptionist replied.

168
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:13,380
Andy and Mary tried to listen to the conversation,
but they were too far away.

169
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,080
Then Mr Green Shirt turned and left the hotel.

170
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,070
'Come on!' said Mary.

171
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,400
'Were going after him.'

172
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,570
'We can't!'

173
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,730
replied Andy.

174
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,920
'We're going to the cinema.'

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,360
'Not now,' said Mary.

176
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,400
She took him by the hand.

177
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
'Come on!'

178
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,730
'Sometimes I don't understand my sister,'
thought Andy.

179
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,460
But he ran out of the hotel with her.

180
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,600
CHAPTER THREE
Going after Mr Green Shirt

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:57,730
Out on the street they stopped and watched
the man in the green shirt walking away.

182
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,340
'Miss O'Brien's going to be angry,' said Andy.

183
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,160
'Not everyone's going to the film,' replied
Mary.

184
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,700
'But she thinks you are,' said Andy.

185
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,980
'Forget about Miss O'Brien,' said Mary.

186
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,260
'This is important.'

187
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,190
Mary watched the man.

188
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,190
He turned right.

189
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,250
Andy and Mary ran after him and turned right
too.

190
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:30,210
'Don't get too near him,' said Mary.

191
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,690
'We don't want him to see us.'

192
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,330
For ten minutes, they walked about fifty metres
behind the man.

193
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:45,790
First, there was Trinity College on their
left, then the National Gallery on their right.

194
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,390
Next came Merrion Square.

195
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:54,170
There were houses round the square, and trees
and gardens in it.

196
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:02,730
The man walked up to the front door of a house,
opened the door and went in.

197
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,840
'OK,' said Andy.

198
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,990
'We can go back now.

199
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,081
We've still got time to get to the cinema.

200
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,470
The film actually starts at half past five.'

201
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,660
'No,' said Mary and took him by the arm.

202
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,890
'We're going to wait in the gardens.'

203
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,540
'Why?'

204
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,800
asked Andy.

205
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,130
'We can't see him.'

206
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,270
'But what's he doing there?' asked Mary.

207
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,550
'I want to know.'

208
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:36,360
Andy was angry, but he didn't say anything.

209
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,230
'I can't leave my sister here,' he thought.

210
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,950
They waited and they waited.

211
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,360
After thirty minutes Andy said, 'Come on,
Mary.

212
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
He's not coming out again.'

213
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,520
'Just five more minutes,' said Mary.

214
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,770
'Please, Andy.'

215
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:06,090
Andy started to speak but just then the front
door opened and Mr Green Shirt came out.

216
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,380
He walked into the gardens.

217
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,680
'Here he comes,' said Mary.

218
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,650
Then she saw the look on the man's face.

219
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,910
'Oh no!'

220
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,170
she said.

221
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,680
'He's coming over here.

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,570
And he's angry.'

223
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,640
The man started to run.

224
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,470
'Who are you?' he shouted.

225
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,240
'I saw you behind me.

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,440
Why are you watching me?'

227
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,870
'Run,' said Mary.

228
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,630
And she and Andy turned and started running.

229
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,980
Mr Green Shirt ran after them.

230
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,970
'Stop!' he shouted.

231
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,790
But they didn't.

232
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,310
At the end of the gardens, Mary saw a man
in a green and red jacket sitting on a big

233
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,310
stone.

234
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,540
She ran up to him.

235
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,660
'Can you help -' she started to say, but then
she stopped.

236
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,700
Andy took her arm.

237
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,740
'Come on!' he said.

238
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,800
'That's not a real person, stupid.

239
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,900
That's a statue of the famous Irish writer,
Oscar Wilde.

240
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,980
There's a picture of it in the hotel.'

241
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,020
They started running again.

242
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,080
Mr Green Shirt was behind them, but he wasn't
very fast.

243
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,070
'Don't stop,' said Andy.

244
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:40,051
They ran out of the gardens and down the street.

245
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:41,051
After two or three minutes, they stopped and
looked back.

246
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,040
Mr Green Shirt wasn't there.

247
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,070
Andy looked at Mary.

248
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,290
She looked afraid.

249
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,410
'It's all right,' said Andy.

250
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,420
He put his arm round her.

251
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,670
'He's much too slow.'

252
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,320
Andy smiled at his sister.

253
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,490
'Come on,' he said.

254
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,980
'We must go and tell Miss O'Brien.'

255
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,110
CHAPTER FOUR
A taxi to the police station

256
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:15,030
Miss O'Brien came back from the cinema at
half past seven.

257
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,380
Mary and Andy went to see her in her room.

258
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,110
'Where were you, Mary?' asked Miss O'Brien.

259
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,560
She looked a little angry.

260
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,240
'Why didn't you come to the cinema with us?'

261
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,820
'I'm very sorry, Miss O'Brien,' said Mary,
'but we've got something to tell you.'

262
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,670
'Well?' asked Miss O'Brien.

263
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,320
She didn't smile.

264
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,160
'Tell me.'

265
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:52,880
First Mary told Miss O'Brien about Mr Green
Shirt in the Trinity College shop.

266
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:02,570
Then she told her about the house in Merrion
Square, and about him running after them.

267
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,039
Miss O'Brien listened to Mary.

268
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,790
For a minute or two, she looked at her hands
and thought.

269
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,230
Then she looked up at Andy and Mary.

270
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,050
'Right,' she said.

271
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:18,110
'We must go and tell the police about this.

272
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,049
I'm going to call a taxi.

273
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,429
You go and wait at the front of the hotel.

274
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,980
I'm coming down in just a minute.'

275
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,019
'Thank you, Miss O'Brien,' said Mary.

276
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:34,840
Andy and Mary went down to the front of the
hotel.

277
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,700
They walked across the street and waited for
the taxi.

278
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,890
'Miss O'Brien is nice,' said Mary.

279
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,500
'She didn't actually get angry with us.'

280
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,169
'No, she didn't.

281
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:55,330
But we're here for two more days,' said Andy
darkly.

282
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,179
'There's still time.'

283
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,140
Andy and Mary stood and waited.

284
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,680
Not many cars drove down Fleet Street.

285
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,190
After five minutes, a taxi turned into the
street.

286
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,190
It stopped just in front of the teenagers.

287
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,299
'This must be our taxi,' said Mary.

288
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,330
She walked over to it and opened the back
door.

289
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,070
'Is this for Miss O'Brien?'

290
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,220
she asked the back of the driver's head.

291
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,600
'That's right,' said the driver.

292
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,510
Mary got into the back.

293
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,610
Andy went round the car, got in next to her
and closed the door.

294
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,679
'Miss O'Brien is just coming,' said Mary to
the driver.

295
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,809
She turned and started to say something to
Andy, but then saw the look on his face.

296
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,190
Andy's eyes were on the driver.

297
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,820
Mary looked at the driver too.

298
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,279
Then she saw it.

299
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,320
Under the driver's brown jacket.

300
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,600
A green shirt!

301
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,419
'Out now,' said Andy and tried to open his
door.

302
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,750
Mary tried her door at the same time.

303
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:21,820
The back doors didn't open, but the front
door did and a second man got into the car.

304
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,690
He was tall and thin.

305
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,230
He wore a blue shirt and black trousers.

306
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,860
He looked back at Andy and Mary.

307
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,000
He had black hair and a cold smile.

308
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,520
'You can't get out,' he said.

309
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,200
'The doors don't open.

310
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,799
And nobody can see in... the windows are dark.'

311
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,379
He turned to Mr Green Shirt.

312
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:53,390
'Go!' he said.

313
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,510
The car started and they drove off.

314
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,230
'What are you doing?

315
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,830
Where are you taking us?' asked Mary.

316
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,149
Mr Blue Shirt turned and looked at Mary.

317
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:10,399
He smiled again.

318
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,230
His eyes really were cold.

319
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:22,279
CHAPTER FIVE
A swim in the River Liffey

320
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,410
'Help!' shouted Andy.

321
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,570
'Help!'

322
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,409
Mr Green Shirt turned on the radio.

323
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:32,760
It was loud rock music.

324
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,370
Nobody heard their shouts.

325
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,480
Mr Blue Shirt turned round again and looked
at Andy and Mary.

326
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,700
He didn't say anything.

327
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,930
He didn't need to.

328
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,460
Andy stopped shouting.

329
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,749
The man turned back and watched the road.

330
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,580
Andy looked out of the window.

331
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
Nobody looked in.

332
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,509
Mr Green Shirt drove across the River Liffey
and turned right.

333
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:05,009
There were houses on their left and the river
on the right.

334
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:07,830
'Where are these men taking us?'

335
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,830
thought Andy.

336
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,200
'What are they going to do?'

337
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,720
He thought of answers to his questions and
he didn't like them.

338
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,309
These men were bad.

339
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,879
'We need to do something quickly,' thought
Andy.

340
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,470
But he didn't know what.

341
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,500
He looked at Mary.

342
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,150
She didn't look afraid.

343
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,520
'The Goodbye Game,' she said.

344
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,230
'What?' thought Andy.

345
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,659
'What is she talking about?

346
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,379
Why is she talking about a film?'

347
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:47,999
The Goodbye Game was a film about a French
cook and his family.

348
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,490
It was a very funny film.

349
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,490
But...

350
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,169
Mr Blue Shirt looked round quickly.

351
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,491
'Stop talking,' he said angrily.

352
00:21:56,491 --> 00:22:00,230
Andy looked at Mary again.

353
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,010
He didn't understand.

354
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,059
What was important about the film?

355
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,409
Mary closed her eyes slowly.

356
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,760
Then she opened them again.

357
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Of course!

358
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,200
Now Andy understood.

359
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:23,789
In the film, the cook is driving down the
road with his five-year-old son in the back

360
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,289
of the car.

361
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:29,070
The son puts his hands over his father's eyes.

362
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,920
The car goes off the road into a tree and
all the doors open.

363
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,540
The father is very angry but... maybe he and
Mary...

364
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:49,960
It was a dangerous thing to do, but they needed
to get away from these men.

365
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,509
He looked at Mary and closed one eye.

366
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,179
She gave him a little smile.

367
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,059
Andy closed his hand.

368
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,610
Mary watched his hand.

369
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:08,380
One finger came out, then a second, then a
third.

370
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:16,220
At the same time, Andy put his hands over
Mr Green Shirts eyes and Mary put hers over

371
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,659
Mr Blue Shirts.

372
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,570
The two men shouted.

373
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:26,650
Mr Green Shirt took his hands off the wheel
and the car turned fast across the road.

374
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,190
The river was now in front of them.

375
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,110
Andy and Mary took their hands away quickly.

376
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,549
Mr Green Shirt put his hands back on the wheel.

377
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:44,559
But the car was too fast and the river was
too close.

378
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,559
'Left!

379
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,559
Left!'

380
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,059
Mr Blue Shirt shouted.

381
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,980
But it was too late.

382
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,559
There were shouts and noise in the car and
on the street.

383
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:04,749
There was rock music from the CD player.

384
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,230
There was more noise, then the sound of the
car hitting the water.

385
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,409
But the doors didn't open.

386
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:14,710
CHAPTER SIX
Talking to the police

387
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,760
'Quick!

388
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,909
Open the window!'

389
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:19,909
Andy shouted.

390
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:28,419
Quickly he and Mary opened the back windows
of the car and started to get out.

391
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:31,120
Water started to come in.

392
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,200
Cold water.

393
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,440
Lots of it, coming in fast.

394
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,470
The men in the front didn't look round.

395
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:46,929
They too just wanted to get out, but the front
doors weren't easy to open.

396
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,260
There was too much water.

397
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
'Out!'

398
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,600
shouted Andy.

399
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,269
He and Mary got quickly into the water.

400
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,700
They were good swimmers.

401
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,639
In minutes, they were out of the water and
on the street.

402
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:11,669
Back in the river, the men opened the car
doors slowly and started to swim away.

403
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,669
'What happened?' asked people on the street.

404
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,480
'Are you OK?

405
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,490
Do you need a doctor?'

406
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,019
There was a seat near the river.

407
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,749
Andy and Mary sat down.

408
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:29,520
A woman started to give Mary her coat.

409
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:38,513
A man in a brown coat took out his phone 
and called the police.

410
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:41,101
Then Andy looked up the street and saw the
blue light of a police station.

411
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:46,490
'There's a police station up there,' he said
to Mary.

412
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,820
He took her by the hand.

413
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,929
'Come on.'

414
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:55,259
They started running up the street in their
wet clothes.

415
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,480
'Hey!

416
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,080
Wait!' called the man in the brown coat.

417
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,379
'The police are coming!'

418
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:04,450
But the teenagers didn't stop.

419
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,269
They ran to the police station.

420
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:15,480
The police took away Andy and Mary's wet clothes
and gave them some old ones.

421
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,570
Then they put the teenagers in a room and
gave them some hot tea and biscuits.

422
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:29,059
Two police officers, a man and a woman, came
into the room and talked to them.

423
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,879
Andy and Mary told them everything.

424
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:37,019
At ten o'clock, the teenagers were still at
the police station.

425
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:41,330
Across the table sat the two officers.

426
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:48,509
The woman, Inspector Helen Forrester, wore
a dark blue jacket and trousers and a white

427
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,509
shirt.

428
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:55,899
The man, Sergeant Tom Brady, wore a light
blue shirt and dark blue trousers.

429
00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:01,450
'We got to the river too late,' Forrester
said to Andy and Mary.

430
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,009
'The men in the car got away.'

431
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:07,999
She put some photos on the table in front
of her.

432
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:14,159
'It's late now and I must call your teacher
and tell her you're OK.

433
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:22,850
But first I've got some photos.'

434
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,850
She turned them over.

435
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,619
'Are any of these the men in the taxi?'

436
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:26,619
she asked.

437
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,539
Andy and Mary started looking at the photos
of men's faces.

438
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:33,440
After a minute or two, Andy took one and gave
it to the inspector.

439
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,299
'Here's one,' he said.

440
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,649
'That's the man with the green shirt.'

441
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:46,730
Then Mary turned a photo round for the inspector
to look at.

442
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:52,700
'And here's Mr Blue Shirt,' she said.

443
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,070
Forrester looked at the photos and gave them
to Brady.

444
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,429
He looked at them.

445
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:03,840
'I know these two,' he said with a small smile.

446
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,190
'OK,' said Forrester to the teenagers.

447
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,820
'Now I'm going to call your teacher.

448
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,450
What did you say her name was again?'

449
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,080
'O'Brien,' replied Mary.

450
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,759
'Miss O'Brien.'

451
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,980
Brady looked quickly at Forrester.

452
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,690
'Of course,' said Forrester.

453
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,119
She thought for a minute.

454
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,299
'And you say she called us about the forged
notes on Grafton Street this afternoon?'

455
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:38,340
'That's right,' replied Mary.

456
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,080
Forrester looked at Brady and then back at
Andy and Mary.

457
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,360
'Is something wrong?' asked Andy.

458
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,250
'No, no,' said Forrester.

459
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,860
'There are a lot of O'Briens in Dublin.'

460
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,659
She looked at Brady.

461
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,759
'Sergeant,' she said, 'you get their clothes.

462
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,580
I'm going to call Miss O'Brien.'

463
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,389
Then she looked at the teenagers.

464
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:06,679
'And you two, wait here a minute.'

465
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,760
The police officers left the room.

466
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,490
Andy looked at Mary.

467
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:17,600
'Why did she say, "There are a lot of O'Briens
in Dublin"?' he asked.

468
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,860
'I don't know,' replied Mary.

469
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,919
CHAPTER SEVEN
A cafe on O'Connell Street

470
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:35,929
At twenty past ten, Miss O'Brien came into
the room at the police station.

471
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,399
Forrester and Brady were behind her.

472
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,399
'Oh!

473
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:40,919
Andy, Mary.

474
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:48,860
There you are,' she said and put her arms
first round Mary, then round Andy.

475
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,090
'Are you all right?

476
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,909
The inspector told me everything.'

477
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:59,749
Forrester spoke, 'OK, you can go now.

478
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:02,669
You get some sleep.

479
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,643
We're going to try and find these men.'

480
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:06,970
Miss O'Brien looked at the teenagers.

481
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,249
'Are you all right?'

482
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:11,009
she asked again.

483
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,669
'Yes,' said Mary, 'I'm OK.'

484
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:17,309
'I'm hungry,' said Andy.

485
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:21,409
Miss O'Brien and the police officers laughed.

486
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,960
'Come on!' said Miss O'Brien.

487
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,470
'There's a late night cafe on O'Connell Street.

488
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,530
It's only five minutes from here.'

489
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:37,919
At ten thirty Mary, Andy and Miss O'Brien
were in Maguire's Cafe on O'Connell Street.

490
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,501
Mary had tea and some biscuits - Andy had
milk and cake.

491
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:48,080
Miss O'Brien took her phone out of her bag.

492
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,480
'Well, I'm going to call my brother,' she
said.

493
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,260
'No more taxis for us!

494
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,380
Fergus can come and get us.'

495
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,480
Miss O'Brien went out of the cafe and made
a short phone call.

496
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,710
Then she came back in and sat down again.

497
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,350
'Well, then,' Miss O'Brien looked at Andy.

498
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,520
'Did you enjoy seeing the Book of Kells this
afternoon, Andy?'

499
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,379
'Yes, I did,' said Andy, laughing, 'but Mary
didn't.'

500
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,359
'Andy!' said Mary.

501
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,519
'That's all right,' said Miss O'Brien.

502
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,570
'Not everyone finds it interesting.'

503
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,130
Andy and Mary finished their food and drinks.

504
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,100
Then they all stood up and walked to the cafe
door.

505
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,899
Miss O'Brien opened it.

506
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:44,169
'That's Fergus's car over there,' she said.

507
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,590
Andy and Mary walked out onto the street.

508
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,970
Twenty metres away to the right was a black
car.

509
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,480
A man in a baseball cap got out.

510
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,879
He turned and opened the back door of the
car.

511
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:03,059
Someone came up behind them from the left.

512
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,230
Then everything happened very fast.

513
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,639
Police officers ran out from everywhere.

514
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:17,559
The man by the car was Mr Blue Shirt.

515
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:18,830
He turned and tried to run, but he was too
slow.

516
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,860
Two police officers quickly stopped him.

517
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,940
The man behind them was Mr Green Shirt.

518
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,240
Two police officers took his arms.

519
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,539
Andy looked round for Miss O'Brien.

520
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,909
But she was fast.

521
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:39,630
She saw the police and started running up
O'Connell Street.

522
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,039
Mr Green Shirt saw this.

523
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,989
'Run, Deirdre, run,' he shouted.

524
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:48,399
Mary looked at Andy.

525
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,570
'How does Mr Green Shirt know Miss O'Brien?'

526
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,330
she asked.

527
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,130
Then she understood.

528
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:11,870
CHAPTER EIGHT
Back at the hotel

529
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,320
Mary shouted 'Quick!' and started running
after Miss O'Brien.

530
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Andy was behind Mary.

531
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,350
Police officers started running behind Andy
and Mary.

532
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,160
But the teenagers were fast.

533
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,830
Mary got to Miss O'Brien first.

534
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,850
She took her right arm.

535
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,850
'Stop!'

536
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,850
she shouted.

537
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,850
'Stop!'

538
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,230
Miss O'Brien tried to get away, but Andy took
her left arm, and then the police were there.

539
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,340
By then it was too late.

540
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:51,809
At twelve o'clock that night Andy and Mary
and Inspector Forrester were back at the hotel.

541
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:56,350
'I phoned your parents and told them everything,'
she said.

542
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,320
'I also spoke to the head of your school.

543
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,200
A new teacher is getting to Dublin tomorrow
morning.

544
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,480
She's going to take you back to England.'

545
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,000
'Thank you,' said Andy.

546
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,050
'But I still don't understand.

547
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,409
How did you know about Miss O'Brien?'

548
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:24,510
'We didn't really,' Forrester started to reply,
'but your Mr Green Shirt is Fergus O'Brien.

549
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,870
And we thought there are a lot of O'Briens
in Dublin but -'

550
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,160
'But they're from the same family,' finished
Mary.

551
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,419
'Yes,' said Forrester.

552
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:42,760
'Actually, Mr Green Shirt is Fergus, Miss
O'Brien's brother.

553
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:49,650
And Mr Blue Shirt, he's Patrick Donnelly,
a friend of theirs.

554
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,590
Donnelly and O'Brien make forged notes and
Deirdre O'Brien, your teacher, helps them

555
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,880
change forged notes for real money.

556
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,840
You saw her brother at work.

557
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,320
He buys something cheap with a forged note
and gets real money back.'

558
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,620
'How do you know she helps him?' asked Andy.

559
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:16,820
'Well, we know that she never called us about
your forged €20 note.

560
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,750
Also her brother left a box here at the hotel
for her this afternoon,' said Forrester.

561
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,960
'You told us about that.'

562
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,840
'That's right,' said Mary.

563
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,730
'Well, we found it in her room,' said Forrester.

564
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:37,350
'There was €20,000 in it.

565
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,910
In €20 and €50 notes.'

566
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,560
Andy and Mary looked at Forrester, their mouths
open.

567
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,120
Then Andy asked, 'But Mr Green Shirt and Mr
Blue Shirt?

568
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,530
How did they know about us and about the hotel?'

569
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,470
'Miss O'Brien phoned them,' said Forrester.

570
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,430
'She told them to come in a taxi and take
you away.

571
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,240
Her brother Fergus sometimes works for Grafton's
Taxis.'

572
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,340
'What did they want to do with us?' asked
Mary.

573
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,990
Forrester stood up.

574
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:17,570
'I think it's time for bed,' she said, 'It's
after twelve o'clock.'

575
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,070
Andy and Mary stood up too.

576
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,280
'Yes,' said Mary.

577
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,310
'I'm tired.'

578
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,460
'Me too,' said Andy.

579
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,370
Forrester looked at them.

580
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:36,560
'Your teachers getting here at eleven o'clock
tomorrow morning,' said Forrester.

581
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,560
'What are you going to do before that?

582
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,430
Why don't you go and see the Book of Kells?'

583
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:50,400
'We saw that today,' said Andy quickly, his
eyes laughing at Mary.

584
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,500
'It was beautiful, wasn't it Mary?'

585
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,330
Forrester saw the look on Andy's face.

586
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,810
'I see,' she said.

587
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,820
She smiled too.

588
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,580
'You didn't like it much then, Mary.'

589
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,720
'No,' she said.

590
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
'I didn't.

591
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,810
And I lost 20 euros when I went there!'

592
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:10,821
- THE END -
