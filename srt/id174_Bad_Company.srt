CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:07,029
A body on the beach
Noise.

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,340
Headache.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,960
Dry mouth.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:24,439
Half asleep, Helen Shepherd turned over in
bed, but the noise didn't stop.

6
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,890
A moment later she woke up.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,119
The noise.

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,599
It was her phone.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,050
She took it off the table next to her bed.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,650
'Yes?'

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,690
she said.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,050
Her dry mouth made it difficult to talk.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,470
And her head hurt quite badly.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,290
Too much wine last night!

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:54,010
'Is that Detective Inspector Shepherd?'

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,680
asked a voice.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,830
'Yes,' said Shepherd.

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,300
'I'm sorry to wake you,' said the voice.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,690
The voice waited for Shepherd to say something,
but she didn't.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,860
She looked at the clock.

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,930
It was six thirty.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:21,070
'Er, well, my name's Webb,' said the voice.

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,780
'Brian Webb.

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,790
I'm your new sergeant.

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,810
I start working for you today.

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,550
Well, this morning, actually.

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,830
Erm...

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,100
I'm sorry to wake you up, but...'

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,860
'Sergeant,' said Shepherd.

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,690
'People call me at all times of the day and
night.

31
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,750
Forget the "sorry".

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,750
Just tell me what the problem is.'

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,229
'There's a body on the beach,' said Webb.

34
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,130
'In Hythe.

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,190
About two hundred metres from the Grand Hotel.

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm there now.'

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:12,920
'I'll be twenty minutes,' replied Shepherd
and put her phone back down on the table.

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,840
Shepherd stood under the shower for five minutes.

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,150
The hot water got the blood moving around
her tired body.

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,670
She drank half a litre of water and took three
aspirins.

41
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,000
Five minutes later she was in her car.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,910
The drive from her house in Folkestone to
Hythe took Shepherd less than ten minutes.

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,870
It was the start of autumn and small seaside
towns like Hythe were becoming quiet again

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,710
after the busy summer.

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:57,500
The school holidays were over, the beaches
were almost empty, and this early in the morning

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,940
there were few cars on the roads.

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,900
As she came into Hythe, Shepherd passed the
Sea view Cafe on her right.

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,790
It was just opening for breakfast.

49
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,320
Two hundred metres down the road, also on
the right, she could see a large building

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,930
- the Grand Hotel.

51
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,080
On her left was the sea wall.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,120
And on the other side of the wall were the
beach and the sea.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,760
There were a number of cars by the side of
the road.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,650
Shepherd stopped behind them.

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:45,150
She looked quickly at herself in the car mirror:
grey-blonde hair tied back, intelligent eyes,

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,709
small nose, thin mouth.

57
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,920
'I don't look too bad,' she thought.

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,769
But she felt tired and old, and her head still
hurt.

59
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,480
She got out of her car and looked over the
wall.

60
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,810
A cold wind was coming off the sea.

61
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,459
The sun was only just up.

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:19,359
About fifty metres along the beach some people
were standing around and looking down at something.

63
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,969
The body.

64
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:27,960
One of them, a young man in a blue suit, looked
round and saw Shepherd.

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,650
'That must be Webb,' thought Shepherd.

66
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,889
'He looks about sixteen.'

67
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:42,199
It was true what people said: as you get older,
police officers look younger.

68
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,240
Webb came to meet Shepherd as she walked over.

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,759
'I'm Brian Webb, madam,' he said.

70
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,240
'Your new sergeant.'

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,259
'I know,' said Shepherd.

72
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,279
'You know?' asked Webb.

73
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,309
'Yes, Sergeant,' replied Shepherd.

74
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:05,009
She waved a hand at the others.

75
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,990
'You're the only person here I don't know,
so you must be my new sergeant.

76
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm a detective, remember.'

77
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,919
'Oh!' said Webb, looking down and then up
again.

78
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,259
Shepherd looked him in the eye.

79
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,749
'And don't call me madam,' she said.

80
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:24,809
'It's Shep.

81
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:27,189
That's what everyone calls me.'

82
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:31,740
'Right, madam - Shep,' said Webb.

83
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,849
'OK,' said Shepherd.

84
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,690
'Let's go and see what we've got.'

85
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,530
They walked over to the other people.

86
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,629
On the beach was the body of a young woman
wearing a dark blue skirt, a white blouse

87
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:49,349
and a short red jacket.

88
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,389
She had a pretty face and short blonde hair.

89
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,080
The back of her head was dark with blood.

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,500
A man in white clothes was down on one knee
looking at the body.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,119
He heard Shepherd arrive and looked up.

92
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:08,530
'Morning, Shep,' he said.

93
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,870
'Dr Atkinson,' replied Shep.

94
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,189
Atkinson stood up and took the plastic gloves
off his hands.

95
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,270
'It's murder,' he said.

96
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,899
'Someone hit her on the back of the head.

97
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,099
It killed her.'

98
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:26,110
'Hit her with what?' asked Shepherd.

99
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,569
'I don't know at the moment,' answered Atkinson.

100
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,029
He looked up and down the beach.

101
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,050
'But it could still be here on the beach.

102
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,610
Not a stone, I don't think.

103
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,779
Something longer.

104
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,780
A piece of wood, maybe.'

105
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,889
Shepherd looked up and down the beach.

106
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,360
There were lots of bits of wood, brought in
by the sea.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,330
'What time did she die?' asked Shepherd.

108
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,400
'Late last night or early this morning,' replied
Atkinson.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,550
'Say between eleven and two.

110
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,479
I can probably tell you more later.'

111
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,669
'OK, thanks,' said Shepherd.

112
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:15,270
She said nothing for a moment and just looked
out to sea.

113
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,369
Her head was feeling better already.

114
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:23,729
Three aspirins and a dead body - a quick way
to make a headache go away.

115
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:29,569
Not funny really - not for the poor woman
dead on the beach.

116
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:35,159
'Excuse me, ma-, I mean Shep,' said Webb.

117
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,279
Shepherd looked at him.

118
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,969
Webb moved uncomfortably from one foot to
the other.

119
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:45,349
He was a bit like a young dog, wanting to
please her all the time.

120
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,089
'The man who found her... er, the body,' began
Webb.

121
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:56,729
'He's a waiter at the Grand Hotel and he thinks
she was staying there.

122
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,680
Well, actually, he's quite sure she was staying
there.'

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,889
'And where is he now?' asked Shepherd.

124
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,969
'Erm... he's at the hotel,' replied Webb.

125
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,110
'He had to go to work.'

126
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,150
'What?' said Shepherd, giving Webb an angry
look.

127
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,860
'Well... erm... he was late already,' replied
Webb.

128
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,080
And what if I want to speak to him?' asked
Shepherd.

129
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,770
'Now?'

130
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,470
'Well...'

131
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,370
Webb looked more uncomfortable.

132
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,090
'I can always.'

133
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,720
'No,' said Shepherd.

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
'Later.

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,070
First, I want you to get as many officers
as you can down here on the beach.

136
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,470
They're looking for the piece of wood or some
other thing that killed this woman.'

137
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,910
'Right, Shep,' replied Webb.

138
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,970
Shepherd turned to Dr Atkinson.

139
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:04,820
'Let the photographer finish his work, then
you can take the body away,' she said.

140
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,400
'OK, Shep,' replied Atkinson.

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,620
Shepherd walked back up the beach and sat
on the top of the sea wall, enjoying the smell

142
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,000
of the sea air.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,430
She looked in her bag for some cigarettes,
then remembered she didn't smoke any more.

144
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,580
Three weeks without a cigarette - not bad.

145
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,410
She watched Webb finish his call.

146
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,620
'He must be one of these university police
officers,' she thought.

147
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,490
'They leave university, become a police officer,
then a sergeant by the age of twenty-five,

148
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,820
and know little about real police work.'

149
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,110
Webb walked up the beach to Shepherd.

150
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,090
'Have you worked on many murders before, Sergeant?'
asked Shepherd.

151
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,050
'No, Shep,' he replied.

152
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,240
'Not many.

153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,080
Well, not any really.'

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:11,020
'So,' thought Shepherd, 'this could be a difficult
job for Webb - his first murder.'

155
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,730
'The first twenty-four hours are the most
important,' said Shepherd.

156
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,680
'Don't forget that.'

157
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
'Yes.

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,180
I mean no.

159
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,560
I won't,' replied Webb.

160
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,500
'I want the person who did this,' said Shepherd.

161
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,160
'And I want him or her by this time tomorrow.

162
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,790
After that our job starts to get more difficult.'

163
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,690
'Right, Shep,' said Webb.

164
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,400
'Now,' said Shepherd.

165
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,880
'You go to the Grand Hotel.

166
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,090
Talk to the waiter who found the body.

167
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,720
Find out who the dead woman is and what she
was doing here.

168
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,780
And get us a room where we can talk to people.'

169
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,200
'OK, Shep,' said Webb.

170
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,760
'I'm going over the road for some breakfast,'
said Shepherd, looking at the Seaview Cafe.

171
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,570
'I'll see you at the hotel in half an hour.'

172
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,430
Webb watched Shepherd walk over to the cafe.

173
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,450
'She wants the job done quickly,' he thought
to himself, 'but first she wants breakfast.

174
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:27,740
This could be a long and difficult day.'

175
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:35,180
CHAPTER TWO
McNab Music International

176
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,190
Twenty-five minutes later Shepherd walked
through the front doors of the Grand Hotel.

177
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,900
She felt much better after a bacon sandwich
and a cup of coffee.

178
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,470
It was eight o'clock and Webb was waiting
for her.

179
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:56,340
There were a number of comfortable sofas and
chairs near the front desk, but at this time

180
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,020
in the morning not many people were around.

181
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:06,570
'I've got us a room,' said Webb, leading the
way to the back of the hotel.

182
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,510
'It's the Wells room - named after H.G. Wells,
the famous writer.

183
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,970
Did you know that he lived near here - between
Hythe and Folkestone?'

184
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,290
'No,' said Shepherd, her voice uninterested.

185
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,600
Soon they came to a door with the word 'Wells'
on it.

186
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Webb opened the door.

187
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,760
'It's not a very large room,' he said.

188
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,890
'The hotel uses it for small meetings and
parties.'

189
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,290
'It's fine,' said Shepherd looking round.

190
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,860
There was a table in the centre of the room
and four chairs down each side of the table.

191
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,060
Shepherd took a chair and waved a hand for
Webb to sit down too.

192
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,530
'OK,' she said.

193
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,660
'What have you got?'

194
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,670
'The dead woman is Claudia Engel,' said Webb.

195
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,540
He took a piece of paper from inside his jacket
and looked at it.

196
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,320
'She's German, but she lived in London.

197
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,320
She was here with three other people from
a company called MMI - McNab Music International.

198
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,180
They're a music company from London.

199
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,290
They use the hotel for meetings from time
to time.'

200
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,100
'Who are the others?' asked Shepherd.

201
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,890
Webb looked down at his piece of paper again.

202
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,700
'James McNab.

203
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,410
It's his company.

204
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:43,880
Then there's Ajit Chowdury and Harriet Johnson.'

205
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,300
Just then the door opened.

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,230
A man came into the room and stopped.

207
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,430
He was tall, in his early forties, clean-shaven
and good-looking.

208
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:03,860
He was well dressed: expensive dark grey suit,
clean white shirt and red tie.

209
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,190
Shepherd could almost smell the money.

210
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,540
The man looked at Webb, then at Shepherd.

211
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,810
'I'm James McNab,' he said to Shepherd.

212
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,310
'Your sergeant said you wanted to see me.'

213
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,060
His voice was rather high for a tall man.

214
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,490
'I asked him why, but he said he couldn't
tell me.'

215
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,490
Shepherd got the feeling that this was a man
who liked to be the boss.

216
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,970
He certainly didn't mind walking into a room
without knocking first.

217
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,200
'Well, what's the problem?' said McNab, looking
at his watch.

218
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,330
'I've got a meeting at nine o'clock and a
lot to do before it.'

219
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:56,240
With Webb so new to the job, Shepherd couldn't
see him asking many questions.

220
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,320
She looked at McNab and tried to decide how
to begin.

221
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,140
'I'd like him to feel less sure of himself
from the beginning,' she thought.

222
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,100
'Does Claudia Engel work for you?' asked Shepherd.

223
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,590
'Yes, she does,' replied McNab.

224
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,590
'And?'

225
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,750
'I'm afraid I've got some bad news,' said
Shepherd.

226
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,160
'We found a body on the beach this morning.

227
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,950
We believe it is Claudia Engel.

228
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,390
We also believe that someone murdered her.'

229
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,510
'What?'

230
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,990
McNab's mouth fell open.

231
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,110
'Claudia?

232
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,361
I don't believe it.

233
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:42,080
It can't be true.'

234
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,089
'I'm afraid it is,' said Shepherd.

235
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,600
'That's terrible!' said McNab.

236
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,660
'Terrible!'

237
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,839
'I need to ask you some questions,' said Shepherd.

238
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,870
'Take a seat.'

239
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,780
'Well,' said McNab, looking at his watch again.

240
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,279
'Of course, I'll do what I can to help.'

241
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,279
He pulled a chair out and sat down.

242
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,420
'Tell me why you're here in Hythe,' said Shepherd.

243
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,990
McNab took a moment to think.

244
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,870
He looked at Webb and then at Shepherd.

245
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,830
'Two or three times a year we come here for
a day or two,' he began.

246
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:32,940
'Our offices are in London, but it's sometimes
easier to work without the phone going every

247
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,690
five minutes.

248
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,390
We come here to get away and talk about important
business.'

249
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,870
'What important business?' asked Shepherd.

250
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,490
McNab moved on his chair.

251
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,490
'Why do you want to know?' he asked.

252
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,670
'I don't like to tell people too much about
our business.

253
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,220
Do you need to know this?'

254
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,290
Shepherd put both hands on the table and sat
up.

255
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:09,659
'Mr McNab,' she said quietly, a hard look
in her eyes, 'we're talking about a murder.

256
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:18,119
I'm going to ask any question I want and you're
going to answer it.'

257
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,889
McNab put both hands up in front of him, as
if keeping Shepherd away.

258
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:24,970
'OK, OK,' he said.

259
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,850
'I was only asking.'

260
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,630
Shepherd sat back.

261
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,929
McNab put his hands down and started speaking
again.

262
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,830
'MMI is a music company.

263
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,110
We make and sell CDs.

264
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,110
We sell music over the internet.

265
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,700
We work with musicians.

266
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:53,400
Anything to do with music, we do it - like
I say, we're in the music business.'

267
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,610
'So what did you come here to talk about?'
asked Shepherd.

268
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:06,820
'We had to decide a number of things,' replied
McNab, but said no more.

269
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,620
Shepherd looked at him.

270
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:17,220
'Mr McNab,' she said angrily, 'this is going
to be much easier if you help me.

271
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,389
What things did you have to decide?'

272
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:28,669
'We have some new bands we're interested in
- we wanted to talk about them,' answered

273
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,450
McNab, not looking at Shepherd.

274
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,499
'Two of them are very good.

275
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:41,950
And I wanted to talk to the others about where
the company is going over the next few years.'

276
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,649
'Tell me about the other people who work for
you,' said Shepherd.

277
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:52,470
McNab looked happier now he was talking about
the people in the company and not company

278
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,549
business.

279
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,149
'Well, there's Ajit Chowdury,' said McNab.

280
00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:01,750
'He's the money man, the company accountant.

281
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,630
Harriet Johnson looks after sales.

282
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,279
She sells MMI's music all round the world.

283
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:16,080
And then Claudia looks... looked after the
music side of things.

284
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,370
The music itself, and the musicians and the
bands.'

285
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,679
'And how does everyone get on?' asked Shepherd.

286
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,789
McNab thought for a moment.

287
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,200
'I think we get on well,' he said.

288
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,710
'Of course, we don't always agree with each
other, but we're always adult about it.

289
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,020
Nobody takes their ball home and says they
don't want to play anymore, if you see what

290
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,070
I mean.'

291
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,970
McNab smiled.

292
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,090
Shepherd didn't smile back.

293
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,190
'Tell us about last night,' she said.

294
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,470
'There's not much to tell,' answered McNab.

295
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,509
'We worked until about five.

296
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:04,740
Then we met in the bar sometime between seven
and seven thirty.

297
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,549
We had dinner together in the restaurant and
finished about nine thirty.

298
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,950
Then we went our different ways.

299
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,419
I went to my room and watched TV for half
an hour.

300
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,489
Then I had a shower and went to bed.'

301
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:26,820
Shepherd looked at Webb to see if he had any
questions.

302
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,639
'Did anything unusual happen yesterday evening?'
he asked.

303
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:35,340
'Good question,' thought Shepherd.

304
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,440
'Maybe there's more to Webb than I thought.'

305
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,749
'No.' began McNab, but then he stopped and
thought.

306
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:47,440
'Actually, yes.

307
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,429
There was something strange.'

308
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:52,299
Webb didn't say anything.

309
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,210
He just waited for McNab to speak again.

310
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,911
'When we were in the bar,' said McNab, 'a
man came in.

311
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:09,910
As soon as he saw Claudia, he turned round
and walked out again - but she saw him.

312
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,110
It was very strange.

313
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,700
Her face turned white.

314
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,330
For a moment she looked terrible.

315
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,249
We asked her if she was OK.

316
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:23,809
She said yes, she was fine.

317
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:26,470
She said it was just someone she once knew.'

318
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,429
'What did the man look like?' asked Webb.

319
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,350
'I really don't remember,' said McNab.

320
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,440
'Fair hair, not tall, not short, nothing unusual.

321
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,889
I only saw him for a few seconds.'

322
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:49,320
Shepherd felt it was important to find out
more about this man and decided to end the

323
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,549
conversation, but McNab was speaking again.

324
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,080
'Inspector,' he said, 'I hope you find this
man soon.

325
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,929
I mean, I'm sure the news of Claudia's murder
will be in the newspapers.

326
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:09,470
But I'd like to keep MMI away from this kind
of news as much as I can.'

327
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,779
Shepherd smiled to herself.

328
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:15,400
McNab, the boss, was looking after his company
again.

329
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,360
'It'll take as long as it takes, Mr McNab,'
she said.

330
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,210
'I'll probably want to talk to you again,
after we've spoken to Ms Johnson and Mr Chowdury.

331
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,070
I'll also want my officers to look round all
your hotel rooms.

332
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,260
You can go now, but don't leave the hotel.'

333
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,679
McNab opened his mouth to say something, but
then he saw the look in Shepherd's eye.

334
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,260
He closed his mouth, looked at Webb, then
back at Shepherd.

335
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,601
'Right,' he said.

336
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:49,559
'Thank you,' said Shepherd.

337
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:56,520
McNab left the room, closing the door behind
him.

338
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,769
Shepherd turned to Webb.

339
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:03,289
'With people like McNab, you've got to let
them know who's the boss,' she said.

340
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:06,779
'It's us - the police - not them.

341
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,460
Don't forget that.'

342
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,110
'Right, Shep,' replied Webb.

343
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,490
'Now,' said Shepherd.

344
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,519
'Harriet Johnson next.

345
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:24,460
But before that, we need to know more about
that man who came into the bar last night.

346
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,480
Get someone to ask around the hotel.

347
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:35,509
Did anyone see a man - our Mr X - come into
the hotel between seven and seven thirty,

348
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:38,090
go into the bar and then leave quickly?

349
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,570
If so, who is he?

350
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,499
I also want to know when Claudia Engel left
the hotel.

351
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,169
And was anyone with her?'

352
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,970
'OK,' said Webb.

353
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,970
He stood up.

354
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,539
'And we need a look at these people's rooms,'
said Shepherd, 'Engel's room and the other

355
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,799
three.

356
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,100
Two officers to each room.

357
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,519
If they find anything strange or unusual,
I want to know.'

358
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,059
'Right, Shep,' said Webb, going to the door.

359
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,610
'And, Sergeant?' said Shepherd.

360
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,759
'Yes,' said Webb.

361
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,759
Shepherd looked at her watch.

362
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,039
It was too early for a glass of wine.

363
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:28,629
'Get someone to bring us some coffee.'

364
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:34,139
CHAPTER THREE
Questions for Ms Johnson

365
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,639
Harriet Johnson was wearing black jeans and
a pink blouse.

366
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:43,019
She had long dark hair and looked very sure
of herself.

367
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,460
She sat down in front of Shepherd and Webb.

368
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,789
'James told me the news,' she said.

369
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,220
'I understand you want to talk to me.'

370
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,970
'Yes,' said Shepherd slowly, giving Johnson
a long look.

371
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,169
'How well did you know Ms Engel?'

372
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,450
'Well enough,' replied Johnson.

373
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,460
'We worked together for two years.'

374
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,429
Shepherd gave her another long look.

375
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,659
Something was wrong.

376
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:21,539
'You don't look sad,' said Shepherd.

377
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,020
Johnson gave a short laugh.

378
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,669
'No, I don't, do I?' she said.

379
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,870
Her mouth smiled, but not her eyes.

380
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,730
'Well, I didn't like Claudia Engel at all.

381
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,749
Actually, I hated her.'

382
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,129
Shepherd looked questioningly at Johnson.

383
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:46,019
'The old, old story,' said Johnson, again
with a short laugh.

384
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,389
'I had a boyfriend.

385
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:50,429
She took him away from me.

386
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:54,289
They started going out while I thought he
and I were still together.

387
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:57,740
Then I found out what was happening.

388
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,200
He left me for her - well, I told him not
to come back actually.

389
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,850
Then later she left him.'

390
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,570
'I see,' said Shepherd.

391
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,960
'She made me very unhappy.

392
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,629
Then she made my boyfriend unhappy.

393
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:18,990
Mind you, he never really did know what he
wanted anyway.

394
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,779
This all happened two years ago, when she
started at MMI.

395
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,869
It all meant nothing to her.

396
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:31,660
But it didn't mean nothing to me.'

397
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,190
'And you hated her,' said Shepherd.

398
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,629
'I did,' said Johnson.

399
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,860
'I probably still do.'

400
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,509
'Yes,' thought Shepherd.

401
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,279
'You do.'

402
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,369
She could almost feel the hate coming across
from the other side of the table.

403
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:51,299
'But I didn't kill her,' said Johnson.

404
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:56,960
'How did the others feel about Engel?' asked
Shepherd.

405
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,059
'McNab, Chowdury.'

406
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,460
Johnson smiled again.

407
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,919
'They didn't like her much,' she answered.

408
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,059
'Ajit Chowdury wanted her job.

409
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,970
OK, he's the accountant, but he thinks he
knows a lot about music.

410
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,499
He doesn't want to sit in an office all day.

411
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:17,190
He wants to be out and about with famous musicians.'

412
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,129
'And McNab?' asked Shepherd.

413
00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:26,070
'Dear old James,' answered Johnson.

414
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,679
'He likes everyone to think he's the boss,
doesn't he?

415
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,129
But, actually...

416
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:36,460
well, he's just a little bit afraid of women.

417
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,019
You probably saw that, Inspector.'

418
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:46,559
For a moment Shepherd thought about smiling,
but decided against the idea.

419
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,700
'Anyway,' Johnson was speaking again, 'he
was certainly afraid of Claudia.

420
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,769
Over the last two years she was the real brains
behind the company.

421
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,330
The musicians loved her.

422
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,129
She knew what music the public wanted to buy.

423
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:08,890
And James knew he just had to agree to her
ideas.'

424
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,909
'How long have you worked for MMI?'

425
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,340
asked Shepherd.

426
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,200
'Fifteen years,' answered Johnson.

427
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,759
'Since James started the company.'

428
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,220
'And the company is doing well?' asked Shepherd.

429
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,460
'Fine,' replied Johnson quickly.

430
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,110
Too quickly maybe, thought Shepherd.

431
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:38,279
'Some of our musicians are big names all over
the world,' said Johnson.

432
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,690
'And we're taking on two new bands.

433
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,249
I haven't heard them, but people say they're
excellent.'

434
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:52,200
'Tell us about last night,' said Shepherd.

435
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,379
Johnson told Webb and Shepherd about the four
of them having drinks in the bar.

436
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:01,460
'Then we had dinner,' said Johnson.

437
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,859
'We finished about nine thirty.'

438
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:10,269
'McNab told us about a man who came into the
bar.

439
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,179
Someone Claudia Engel knew,' said Shepherd.

440
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,179
'You haven't told us about him.'

441
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,249
'I didn't see him,' replied Johnson.

442
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:23,240
'I had my back to the door, and by the time
I turned round, he was gone.'

443
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,769
'But you're sure Ms Engel knew him?'

444
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,600
Shepherd made it a question.

445
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,169
'Oh yes,' said Johnson.

446
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:35,220
'The look on her face told me that.

447
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,480
Actually, I think she met him later.

448
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,759
She certainly met someone.'

449
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,820
Shepherd looked questioningly at Johnson.

450
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,960
After dinner I sat in the lounge, had a coffee
and read a book,' began Johnson.

451
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:59,929
'While I was there, Claudia came down from
her room and went out of the front doors.

452
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:06,259
From where I was sitting I could see through
the doors - they're glass - and she was standing

453
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,690
there.

454
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,120
Outside.

455
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,549
Waiting.

456
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,249
I'm sure she was waiting for someone.

457
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,640
Then she walked away to the left.

458
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,380
It was as if she could see the person she
was meeting.'

459
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,239
'Why did you think that?' asked Shepherd.

460
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:28,779
'Just the way she was walking,' said Johnson.

461
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:34,720
'But you didn't see the person she was meeting?'
asked Shepherd.

462
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,919
'No,' said Johnson.

463
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,570
'It was too dark.'

464
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,879
'What time was this?' asked Shepherd.

465
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:47,649
'Probably about ten thirty,' answered Johnson.

466
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,519
'Maybe ten forty-five.

467
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,820
I went up to my room soon after that.'

468
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,539
She moved uncomfortably on her chair.

469
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:02,399
'And you didn't see Ms Engel again?' asked
Shepherd.

470
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,009
'No,' replied Johnson.

471
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:08,249
Shepherd looked at Webb.

472
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:13,100
'There's salt on your shoes,' he said to Johnson.

473
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,970
'What do you mean?' asked Johnson.

474
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,980
'They're white round the bottoms,' said Webb.

475
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
'That's salt.

476
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
From the sea.

477
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,519
Have you been on the beach?'

478
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,690
Shepherd looked at Johnson's shoes.

479
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,779
They were black trainers.

480
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:32,140
And there was salt round the bottom of them.

481
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,000
'Not bad, Webb,' she thought.

482
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,190
'Well, I went for a walk on the beach yesterday
afternoon,' replied Johnson.

483
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,690
'Yesterday afternoon?'

484
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,980
Webb made it a question.

485
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,580
'Yes,' replied Johnson.

486
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,359
'You didn't go out again in the evening?

487
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,119
After ten thirty perhaps?' asked Webb.

488
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,629
'No,' answered Johnson, her voice not as strong
as before.

489
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:06,989
'I've told you.

490
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:09,700
I went up to my room.'

491
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,169
Webb said nothing.

492
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:14,059
He just looked at Johnson.

493
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,750
Shepherd could see Johnson's face beginning
to go a little red.

494
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,169
Maybe there was something she didn't want
the police to know.

495
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,940
Johnson moved uncomfortably on her chair again.

496
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,480
'I've told you,' she said again.

497
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,559
'I went up to my room.'

498
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,970
Webb looked at Shepherd.

499
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,159
'OK, Ms Johnson,' said Shepherd.

500
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,929
'You can go.

501
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,190
We'll want to talk to you again, so don't
leave the hotel.

502
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,190
OK?'

503
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:49,270
'Right,' said Johnson quietly, and she left
the room, head down.

504
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,330
Shepherd and Webb looked at each other.

505
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:56,330
'She wasn't very happy about something, was
she?' said Shepherd.

506
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,350
'There's something she's not telling us,'
answered Webb.

507
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,059
'Or maybe she just didn't like my questions.'

508
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:05,129
Shepherd stood up.

509
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:10,369
'I need some air,' she said, taking her bag
off the back of the chair.

510
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,349
'And I've got a call to make.

511
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:17,899
Go and see if there's any news about our Mr
X or from the officers in the rooms.

512
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:23,259
I'll be outside the front of the hotel.'

513
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:24,259
***

514
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:28,489
Fifteen minutes later Shepherd was standing
outside the front doors of the hotel.

515
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,629
Her phone was in her hand.

516
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:34,749
Webb came out of the hotel at a fast walk.

517
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,700
He had a piece of paper in his hand.

518
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,320
'Two things, Shep,' he said.

519
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,720
Shepherd closed her phone.

520
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
'Well?'

521
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
she asked.

522
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,009
'We know who Mr X is,' said Webb, looking
pleased with himself.

523
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:56,200
'And one of the receptionists agrees with
Johnson that Engel left the hotel at ten thirty.

524
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:07,499
But she also saw Chowdury leave the hotel
at about ten forty-five.'

525
00:34:07,499 --> 00:34:15,440
CHAPTER FOUR
How well is MMI doing?

526
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,990
Shepherd waited for Webb to say more, but
he didn't.

527
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,890
'He probably wants me to say, "Well done,"'
she thought.

528
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,320
'Come on.

529
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,180
Don't just stand there.

530
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,150
Tell me,' she said.

531
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,290
Webb looked uncomfortable.

532
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,220
His face went a little red.

533
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,110
He looked at the piece of paper in his hand.

534
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:45,300
'Well... erm... the man's called Darren Fleming.

535
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,790
We talked to some of the people who work in
the bar.

536
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,330
He comes into the hotel for a drink from time
to time.

537
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,730
He lives in Hythe somewhere.

538
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,580
We're trying to find him now.'

539
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,500
'Right,' said Shepherd.

540
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,870
'When you do, bring him here.

541
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,130
What about Chowdury?'

542
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,770
Webb looked at the paper in his hand again.

543
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,160
'Do you always write things down?' asked Shepherd.

544
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,250
'Do you have problems remembering?'

545
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:23,620
'No, Shep,' said Webb, smiling a little, but
still looking rather uncomfortable.

546
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,620
He waved the paper at her.

547
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,760
'Someone gave me this.

548
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,600
Detective Constable Fox I think his name is.'

549
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,200
'All right, all right,' said Shepherd.

550
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,350
She preferred not to think about DC Fox.

551
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:44,970
Fox loved writing everything down, putting
everything in the right place, doing everything

552
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,090
just right.

553
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,750
Not Shepherd's sort of person at all.

554
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,540
'I know he's a lot older than you,' said Shepherd.

555
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,330
'But don't take too many lessons from Fox.'

556
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,870
'I'll try not to,' replied Webb.

557
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:08,110
For a moment Webb thought he saw the start
of a smile on Shepherd's face, but then it

558
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,100
was gone.

559
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:18,500
'The receptionist remembered Chowdury leaving
the hotel at about ten forty-five last night,'

560
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
said Webb.

561
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,890
'He was dressed in running clothes.'

562
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,090
Shepherd thought for a moment.

563
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,020
'OK,' she said.

564
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,100
'Get Ajit Chowdury.

565
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,560
We'll have a talk with him next.'

566
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,450
She put her phone away in her bag.

567
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,900
'I've just been on the phone to a friend of
mine in London,' she told Webb.

568
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,570
'She told me some interesting things about
MMI.

569
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:57,020
I hope the company accountant has some good
answers.'

570
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
***

571
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,070
Twenty minutes later Chowdury was sitting
in the Wells room in front of Shepherd and

572
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,070
Webb.

573
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,890
It was ten thirty.

574
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,060
Chowdury was a tall good-looking man in his
early thirties.

575
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:16,630
He had on a dark brown suit, cream shirt and
light brown tie.

576
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:22,050
His fingers were playing with the front of
his jacket; his eyes were looking from Shepherd

577
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,480
to Webb and back again.

578
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,450
'Softly, softly,' thought Shepherd.

579
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,840
'Don't make him uncomfortable, or he won't
say anything.

580
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,810
Start with some easy questions.'

581
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:43,930
'Tell us about your job, Mr Chowdury,' she
began.

582
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,660
Chowdury sat back in the chair and stopped
playing with his jacket.

583
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,110
'I'm the company accountant.

584
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:54,900
I look after the money,' he answered, smiling
a little.

585
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,030
'So I understand,' said Shepherd.

586
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,440
'And is it a good job?

587
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,750
A good company to work for?'

588
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,270
'Well, yes.

589
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,970
I think so,' he replied.

590
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,120
'Do you all like each other?

591
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,700
I mean, do you work well together?' asked
Shepherd.

592
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,600
'We aren't all great friends,' he replied.

593
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,760
'But we work well together.

594
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,820
Yes.'

595
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,150
'Claudia Engel too?' asked Shepherd quietly.

596
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,220
Chowdury looked away to one side for a moment
then back at Shepherd.

597
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,910
'She could be rather difficult,' he said.

598
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,310
'Tell me about it,' said Shepherd.

599
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:45,000
'Believe me, I know all about working with
difficult people.'

600
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,180
Chowdury gave her a small smile.

601
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,120
'She was a hard woman,' he began.

602
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,880
'She knew what she wanted.

603
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,020
She knew how to get it.

604
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,690
And she didn't allow anybody to get in her
way.'

605
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:07,040
'I understand you know quite a bit about music,'
said Shepherd, 'as well as money.'

606
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,010
'Yes,' replied Chowdury.

607
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,560
'But Claudia never listened to what I thought.

608
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,480
I spend a lot of time in clubs.

609
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,160
I've seen a lot of good new bands.

610
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,960
But she always knew best.'

611
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,150
There was something strange in Chowdury's
voice that made Shepherd ask her next question.

612
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,310
'Were you lovers?'

613
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,750
she asked.

614
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,300
Webb turned quickly to look at Shepherd.

615
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,310
There was fire in Chowdury's eyes.

616
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,790
'It's nothing to do with...' he started.

617
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:50,310
'It's murder,' said Shepherd, her voice hard,
before Chowdury could finish.

618
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,770
Chowdury's head went down.

619
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,640
Then he looked at her again.

620
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,350
'We slept together once,' he said, an angry
look in his eyes.

621
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,570
And then she said that was it.

622
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,380
It was over.

623
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,380
Finished.'

624
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,900
'And that made you angry,' said Shepherd.

625
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,750
It wasn't a question.

626
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,890
'It still does,' said Chowdury.

627
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,370
'But not enough to kill her.

628
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,010
It hurt me at the time, but it was just one
night.

629
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,550
And she didn't tell everyone about it.

630
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,450
No-one in the office knew.'

631
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:29,660
'Did she like working for McNab?' asked Shepherd.

632
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:36,141
'When she started, she was quite happy,' began
Chowdury, 'but things have been difficult

633
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,660
for the last month or two.'

634
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,580
'In what way?' asked Shepherd.

635
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:49,440
'Well, at first she and James always agreed
on everything,' replied Chowdury.

636
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,770
'But, like I said, for the last month or two
they haven't.

637
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:59,901
I was walking past McNab's room yesterday
afternoon - we're all on the second floor

638
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:03,250
- and I could hear her in there.

639
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,260
They were shouting at each other.'

640
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,580
'What about?' asked Shepherd.

641
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,140
'I didn't hear much,' answered Chowdury.

642
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,350
'One of the hotel cleaners was near, so I
couldn't stop and listen.

643
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,360
But I did hear her say, "You need me, James.

644
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:27,340
Give me what I want, or your company is finished."

645
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,730
That was all I heard.'

646
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:34,890
'What do you think she wanted?' asked Shepherd.

647
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:35,890
'Money.'

648
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,120
Chowdury didn't stop to think for a moment.

649
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:44,560
'Ah!' said Shepherd, thinking about the telephone
conversation with her friend in London.

650
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,490
And how is the company doing?' asked Shepherd.

651
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,200
'I've heard it's not doing too well.'

652
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,590
'Who told you that?' asked Chowdury quickly.

653
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,290
'How is the company doing?'

654
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,750
Shepherd asked again, her voice a little harder.

655
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,620
Chowdury thought for a moment.

656
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,600
'Not great,' he said.

657
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,411
'I mean, I'm the accountant.

658
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:20,560
I can make the numbers look good on paper,
but actually they're not great.

659
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,590
Some of our big stars aren't as good as they
were.

660
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,060
Sales fell last year and will fall again this
year.

661
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:34,080
There are two new bands out there that we
think are very good.

662
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:41,320
Claudia was trying to get them to work with
MMI, but they're still thinking about it.'

663
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,860
'I see,' said Shepherd.

664
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,730
She said nothing for a moment.

665
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,250
Then Webb spoke.

666
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,620
'What about last night?' he asked.

667
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,410
'Where were you going at about a quarter to
eleven?'

668
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,060
'For a run.

669
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Why?'

670
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,700
asked Chowdury.

671
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,350
'Which way did you go?' asked Webb.

672
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,880
'Out of the hotel and right,' replied Chowdury.

673
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,360
'I ran along by the beach for four or five
kilometres and then came back.

674
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,050
I got back about eleven thirty.'

675
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:25,620
Shepherd thought, 'Claudia Engel's body was
a few hundred metres to the left of the hotel.

676
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,290
The other way.'

677
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,570
At that moment DC Fox's head came round the
door.

678
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,310
'Shep,' he said.

679
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,870
'You'll want to see this.'

680
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:41,340
Shepherd left the room for a moment and then
came back in.

681
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,470
Fox stood by the door.

682
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,150
In Shepherd's hand was a golf club in a long
plastic bag.

683
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:56,040
'One of my officers found this in your room,'
she said to Chowdury.

684
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,430
'Is it yours?'

685
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:08,850
CHAPTER FIVE
More about Claudia Engel

686
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,550
Chowdury opened his mouth and closed it again.

687
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,640
'Yes, it's mine,' he said.

688
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,350
'You only have one golf club?' asked Shepherd.

689
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,350
'It's a new one,' answered Chowdury.

690
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,890
'I bought it the day before yesterday.

691
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,340
My other clubs are in the golf bag in the
back of my car.'

692
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:38,650
'We'll need to look at those too,' said Shepherd,
putting out a hand.

693
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,470
'Keys, please.'

694
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,880
Chowdury gave his car keys to Shepherd.

695
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,340
She passed his keys and the golf club to Fox.

696
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,050
'You know what to do,' she said.

697
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:55,350
'Yes, Shep,' Fox replied.

698
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,520
Shepherd looked at her watch, then at Chowdury.

699
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,810
'You can go,' she said, 'but don't leave the
hotel.

700
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,830
I'll have more questions for you later.'

701
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,240
Chowdury left the room.

702
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,660
Webb looked at Shepherd.

703
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,220
'Your phone call,' he said.

704
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,700
'That's how you know business is not good.'

705
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,950
'Yes,' replied Shepherd.

706
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,980
'A friend in the music business.

707
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,280
It's a small world.'

708
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,230
'And how did you know that Chowdury and Engel
were lovers at one time?'

709
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,820
Webb asked.

710
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,180
'I didn't,' said Shepherd.

711
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:43,140
'But there was something in his voice that
made me think it was a good question to ask.'

712
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,010
Shepherd took a pen from the table and started
playing with it.

713
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,000
'And DC Fox told me that Darren Fleming is
here.

714
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,050
Get him in here next.

715
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,700
Ask for some sandwiches for later too.

716
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,710
And more coffee, if you want it.'

717
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,710
Shepherd looked at her watch.

718
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,250
It was twelve o'clock.

719
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,090
Time for a real drink.

720
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,810
And you can get me a glass of red wine from
the bar,' she said.

721
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,870
Webb looked at Shepherd as he stood up.

722
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,500
She was certainly different from other police
inspectors he knew.

723
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,190
But he just said, 'Right, Shep.'

724
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,680
And this time you ask the questions,' said
Shepherd.

725
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,820
Webb smiled.

726
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,900
'Thanks.'

727
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:39,140
'Don't thank me yet,' replied Shepherd, not
smiling back.

728
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,210
'I'll be in here with you.'

729
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,210
***

730
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,380
A few minutes later, they were back in the
Wells room.

731
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:53,570
Shepherd and Webb were in their usual seats;
Darren Fleming was opposite them.

732
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:58,840
Fleming was in his late twenties, wearing
jeans and a brown shirt.

733
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,670
'Why am I here?' he asked Shepherd.

734
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,610
'You were in the hotel last night,' said Webb.

735
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,780
'Yes, but only for a short time,' answered
Fleming.

736
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,340
'Why was that?' asked Webb.

737
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,200
'Because I saw someone...'

738
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,200
began Fleming.

739
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,200
He stopped.

740
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,640
He looked at Shepherd, then back at Webb.

741
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,960
'What's all this about?' he asked.

742
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,320
'We found a body on the beach early this morning,'
said Webb.

743
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,330
'Claudia Engel's body.

744
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,420
She was dead.'

745
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,420
'Murdered?'

746
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,420
asked Fleming.

747
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,060
'Yes,' said Webb.

748
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,860
'Poor Claudia,' said Fleming.

749
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,650
'Poor Claudia.'

750
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:52,650
'You knew her?' asked Webb.

751
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,050
'Yes.

752
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,700
We were students together in London,' said
Fleming.

753
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,050
'We lived in the same house.

754
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,750
For a year.

755
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,820
Not happy times.'

756
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,080
'Why not?' asked Webb.

757
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,440
'It was an unhappy house - mainly because
of Claudia,' said Fleming.

758
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,370
He was quiet for a moment, remembering.

759
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,220
Then he spoke again.

760
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:29,680
'We were studying the same thing - business
- so I saw a lot of her.

761
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,630
She wasn't a nice person.

762
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:37,860
When she said something, you never knew if
it was true.

763
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:47,050
She sometimes told stories about people - other
students - and I knew the stories were untrue.

764
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:53,880
She could be really nice if she wanted something
- help with her studies, someone to cook her

765
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,570
a meal - but you had to do what she wanted.

766
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:04,020
If you didn't, she told everyone else how
terrible you were.

767
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,680
By the end of the year I just wanted to get
out of that house.

768
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,920
There were five of us living there and everyone
felt the same way.'

769
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,980
'Did she know how you felt?' asked Webb.

770
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,200
'Oh yes,' said Fleming.

771
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,940
'She certainly knew how I felt.

772
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,140
One time she wanted to borrow a piece of my
work.

773
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,780
She wanted to use it in something she was
doing.

774
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,540
I wasn't having any of it.

775
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,210
I told her no.

776
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,850
She could do her own work.

777
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:42,290
She said some bad things about me to other
people and I found out.'

778
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:46,250
'And?' asked Webb.

779
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,050
'I told her what I thought of her.

780
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,100
In front of most of the students from one
of our classes.

781
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,620
I was so angry.'

782
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,940
Then Fleming smiled.

783
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,140
'But that was ten years ago,' he said.

784
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,340
And are you still angry?' asked Webb.

785
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,300
'Because you just turned round and walked
out of the hotel last night.'

786
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,900
Fleming sat up in his chair and looked at
Webb.

787
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,050
'No,' he said.

788
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,000
'I'm not angry now.

789
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,480
If anything, I feel sorry for her.

790
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,980
She had no real friends.

791
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,100
But yes, I walked out last night.

792
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,990
The past is sometimes a dangerous place.

793
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,540
I didn't want to go there.

794
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,000
I went back home.

795
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,450
I was unlucky enough to see Claudia Engel
for about five seconds yesterday evening.

796
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,630
That's all.

797
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:46,170
I didn't see her again.

798
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,870
Now can I go?'

799
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,140
'You didn't meet her later that evening?'
asked Webb.

800
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,240
'Certainly not,' replied Fleming.

801
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:01,440
'Was anyone with you when you were at home?'
asked Webb.

802
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,830
'No,' replied Fleming.

803
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,600
'Did you phone anyone?

804
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,890
Email anyone?' asked Webb.

805
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,120
'No,' replied Fleming.

806
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,460
Webb looked at Shepherd.

807
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,580
'Put all this in writing for one of my officers,'
Shepherd told Fleming.

808
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,700
'Then you can go.

809
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,480
But don't leave Hythe.'

810
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
***

811
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,210
Ten minutes later Shepherd and Webb were standing
outside the front doors of the hotel.

812
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:37,760
Webb had a sandwich, Shepherd her glass of
wine.

813
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,920
'What a nice young woman Claudia Engel was!'
said Shepherd.

814
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,120
Webb smiled.

815
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,960
Shepherd drank some wine.

816
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,980
'Good questioning in there,' she said.

817
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,690
'Thank you,' said Webb.

818
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,530
'Don't get too pleased with yourself,' said
Shepherd.

819
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,520
'We've still got a long way to go.'

820
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,140
Webb smiled to himself.

821
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:10,350
'By the way, Shep,' he began, 'there's a door
at the back of the hotel where you could go

822
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,130
out without anyone seeing you.'

823
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,970
'Right,' said Shepherd.

824
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,760
'That's good to know.'

825
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,490
Shepherd thought for a moment.

826
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:26,500
'Let's go and have a look round Engel's room,'
she said.

827
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:33,240
'I know DC Fox has been there already, but
I want to see it for myself.

828
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,420
Fox is a good officer, but sometimes he's
too careful.

829
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,610
He doesn't let his brain run free.

830
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:46,450
Get the key from reception and meet me on
the second floor.'

831
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,450
***

832
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:55,310
A few minutes later Webb met Shepherd outside
Claudia Engel's room.

833
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:01,060
'Reception gave me a key, but it isn't Engel's,'
said Webb as he opened the door.

834
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,690
'No-one can find her key and it wasn't on
the body.'

835
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:10,740
'Oh,' said Shepherd, 'that's interesting.'

836
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:15,570
Claudia Engel had a large double room looking
over the sea.

837
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,590
'I'll start in the bathroom,' said Shepherd.

838
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,590
'You look round here.'

839
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,480
'What are we looking for?' asked Webb.

840
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,050
'We'll know it when we see it,' answered Shepherd.

841
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,720
Shepherd took a quick look round the bathroom.

842
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,100
There wasn't much to see - Engel was only
staying two or three nights.

843
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,670
Shepherd saw nothing unusual.

844
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:42,260
She went back into the bedroom.

845
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,170
Webb was looking through Engel's clothes.

846
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,480
'Anything?' asked Shepherd.

847
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,060
'No, Shep,' answered Webb.

848
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,280
Shepherd looked round the room.

849
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,110
There was a book, a clock and a music magazine
on the table next to the bed.

850
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:04,080
Some keys on the table too - house and car,
thought Shepherd.

851
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,990
A raincoat behind the door - nothing in the
pockets.

852
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:12,200
She looked round the room again.

853
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,780
Something was wrong.

854
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,730
She didn't know what.

855
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:21,560
She could feel her morning headache coming
back, just when she didn't need it.

856
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,230
Just then she heard Webb's phone.

857
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,800
He answered it.

858
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,400
Shepherd looked out of the window at the sea,
not listening to Webb's conversation, but

859
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,100
thinking about the room.

860
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,590
What was wrong with it?

861
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:39,330
And where was Engel's key?

862
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,910
She heard Webb finish his conversation.

863
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,780
Shepherd looked at Webb.

864
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,300
'Well?'

865
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,450
she asked.

866
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:52,090
'Nothing important,' replied Webb.

867
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,470
Shepherd looked round the room a third time.

868
00:54:54,470 --> 00:55:00,430
'You know I said, "We'll know it when we see
it,"' she began.

869
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,380
'Yes?' said Webb questioningly.

870
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:09,440
'Well, we'll also know it if we don't see
it,' said Shepherd.

871
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,830
'What do you mean?' asked Webb.

872
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,020
Then he smiled.

873
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,210
'Oh, I see.

874
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,400
So what have we not found - other than the
key?'

875
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,521
'The thing that business people all around
the world carry with them at all times,' said

876
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:29,521
Shepherd.

877
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:34,400
'A laptop computer,' replied Webb.

878
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,640
'Let's start again,' said Shepherd.

879
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,770
Five minutes later they were finished.

880
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:47,650
There wasn't a laptop in the room - not in
the cupboard, not under the bed, not in the

881
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,200
bed, nowhere.

882
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,500
'We need to find it,' said Shepherd.

883
00:55:54,500 --> 00:56:00,170
'First, find out if she had one here - I can't
believe she didn't - and find out what sort

884
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,360
it was.

885
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,980
Then put all our officers on it.

886
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,320
Look all around the hotel.

887
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,370
Have another look in the rooms of those other
three jokers - McNab, Johnson and Chowdury.

888
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,480
Send someone round to Fleming's house.

889
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,540
And get as many people as you can to go along
the beach again.'

890
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,430
'Right, Shep,' said Webb.

891
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:29,140
'After that, you'll find me in the bar,' said
Shepherd.

892
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:35,000
CHAPTER SIX
Unanswered questions

893
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,780
At two o'clock Webb found Shepherd, sitting
at the bar, talking to the barman.

894
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,550
She looked round as Webb came in.

895
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,780
The barman moved away.

896
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,570
'Engel had a laptop,' said Webb, sitting next
to her.

897
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,690
'We know what sort it is.

898
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:57,560
I've got all our officers looking for it.'

899
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,060
'Good,' said Shepherd.

900
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:05,190
'Now, there are a number of things I want
to know.

901
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:08,870
For a start, what's on Engel's laptop?

902
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:14,690
Second, why did Engel think that MMI needed
her so much?

903
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:21,180
Remember what Chowdury heard her say - "Give
me what I want, or your company is finished."

904
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,240
What could she do to bring an end to the company?

905
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:32,420
Next, what's Harriet Johnson not telling us?

906
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,340
She was very uncomfortable about some of our
questions.

907
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:43,920
And last, why do McNab and Johnson say that
the business is doing well when Chowdury says

908
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,770
it isn't, and my friend in the music business
knows it isn't?'

909
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,020
Shepherd waved at the barman.

910
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:57,130
'I'll have a glass of red wine, please,' she
said.

911
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,020
Webb gave Shepherd a funny look.

912
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,330
Shepherd saw it.

913
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:08,450
'When you've done this job as long as I have,
Sergeant,' she said, 'you'll find you need

914
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:11,700
a glass of red wine now and then.'

915
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:17,090
'While you're working?' asked Webb.

916
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,880
'It helps me think,' replied Shepherd.

917
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,030
A grey-haired man came into the room and stood
at the far end of the bar.

918
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:32,130
He put his keys on top of the bar and waited
for the barman to come over.

919
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,860
DC Fox came to the door and waved.

920
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:41,530
'See what he wants,' said Shepherd and stayed
sitting.

921
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,950
Webb left the room to talk to Fox.

922
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,230
Shepherd sat and thought.

923
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:55,060
She looked at the grey-haired man, now sitting
at the other end of the bar.

924
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,420
Then she looked at his keys.

925
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,310
There were four or five.

926
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,550
And something else.

927
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,250
What was it?

928
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh yes!

929
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,500
A memory stick for a computer.

930
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,850
Webb came back.

931
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,840
'They've found Engel's room key and her laptop,'
he told Shepherd.

932
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,480
'They were hidden in an old garage at the
back of the hotel.

933
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,190
But I don't think we're going to get anything
from the laptop.

934
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,340
Someone's broken it up.

935
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,060
It was in pieces.

936
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,059
And I'm not sure we've got all the bits.'

937
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,240
Shepherd put her head in her hands for a moment.

938
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:37,230
Then she looked up and saw the memory stick
on the bar again.

939
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,660
It gave her an idea.

940
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,720
'Wait a minute,' she said.

941
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,420
She looked out of the window, and thought
for a minute.

942
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,090
Then she looked at Webb.

943
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,530
'I've had an idea.'

944
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:57,750
She thought for a few moments more, a finger
to her mouth, her eyes half closed.

945
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,900
'OK.

946
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,360
Let's do it,' said Shepherd.

947
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:09,200
'I want to see McNab, Johnson and Chowdury
in the Wells room.

948
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,380
Fleming too.

949
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,590
Send a car for him.

950
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,960
Let's say we'll meet in forty-five minutes.

951
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,940
I've got a few things to do first.'

952
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:27,860
'Right, Shep,' said Webb and left the room,
asking himself what her idea could be.

953
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,780
Shepherd sat for a few minutes, thinking through
her idea.

954
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,290
Then she left too, taking her wine with her.

955
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,290
***

956
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:44,260
It was four thirty by the time Webb got everyone
together in the Wells room.

957
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,200
Shepherd walked in and looked round.

958
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,280
Webb was already sitting in his usual place.

959
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,430
Across the table sat Chowdury, McNab and Johnson.

960
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:57,020
Fleming sat a little away from the table.

961
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,620
DC Fox stood just inside the door.

962
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:03,450
'Good afternoon, everyone,' said Shepherd.

963
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,190
'This is Mr Fleming.'

964
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:08,250
She waved a hand at Fleming.

965
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,320
'You will know him from last night.

966
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,500
He knew Ms Engel some years ago.'

967
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,550
She looked at Fleming.

968
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:21,270
'Over here are Mr McNab, Ms Engel's boss,
and Mr Chowdury and Ms Johnson, who worked

969
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,070
with Ms Engel.'

970
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,250
Shepherd walked round the table.

971
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:31,800
There was an envelope in her hand, which she
put on the table in front of her chair.

972
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,440
Then she sat down.

973
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:41,140
'I've asked you all here together because
one of you killed Claudia Engel,' said Shepherd.

974
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:45,300
Everyone started speaking at the same time.

975
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,750
Shepherd put up a hand.

976
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,440
'Stop talking,' she said.

977
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,510
Everyone stopped speaking.

978
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:59,380
'I don't know how many friends Ms Engel had,'
began Shepherd, 'but certainly no-one here

979
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,900
was friends with her.'

980
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,580
McNab started to say something, but Shepherd
put up a hand again.

981
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,030
'Later, Mr McNab,' she said.

982
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:10,910
'You can say something later.'

983
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:16,020
'Not one of you liked her.

984
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,180
Each of you could be the killer.

985
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:24,860
Mr Fleming, you say you were at home, but
we don't know if that's true.

986
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:31,110
Mr Chowdury, you say you turned right for
a run along the beach, but what if you went

987
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,530
the other way?

988
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:39,750
Ms Johnson, you say you sat in the lounge
and then went to your room, but what if you

989
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,119
went outside?

990
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:49,900
And Mr McNab, you say you watched TV in your
room and then went to bed, but how do we know

991
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,290
that?'

992
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:56,350
Shepherd saw Johnson look at McNab and move
on her seat.

993
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:59,050
'Now look here-' said McNab.

994
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:02,660
'Shut up,' said Shepherd.

995
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:07,080
She looked at the four faces in front of her,
then at McNab.

996
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,190
'MMI isn't doing well, is it?'

997
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,190
she said.

998
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:15,530
And don't try and tell me it is.'

999
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:17,800
McNab gave Chowdury an angry look.

1000
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,970
'I didn't tell her,' said Chowdury.

1001
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,450
'She knew already.'

1002
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:24,930
McNab looked back at Shepherd.

1003
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,510
'How...' he began.

1004
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:30,420
'Is it?' said Shepherd.

1005
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,450
'No, it isn't,' said McNab.

1006
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:37,440
'But there are these two new bands.'

1007
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,720
'Ah, yes!' said Shepherd.

1008
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,230
'The two bands.

1009
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,200
Are they real?'

1010
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,840
'Yes,' said McNab and Chowdury at the same
time.

1011
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,250
'Good,' said Shepherd.

1012
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,460
'Now have I got this right?

1013
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:59,210
If these two bands come to MMI, your company
is OK.

1014
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:06,800
But if these two bands go to a different company,
then that's the beginning of the end for MMI.

1015
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,580
Is that right?'

1016
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,040
'Well...' began McNab.

1017
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,730
'Yes,' said Chowdury.

1018
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:19,420
'He'll try and tell you something different,
but MMI is just a small company.

1019
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,820
It can't get much smaller.'

1020
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:27,940
'So, if the bands don't come to you, that's
the end of MMI.

1021
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,490
And you all lose your jobs,' said Shepherd.

1022
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:36,890
And the person who was bringing the bands
to MMI was Claudia Engel.'

1023
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,920
'What are you saying?' asked McNab.

1024
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,440
'I'm not saying anything,' said Shepherd.

1025
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,430
'I'm just making sure we all understand where
we are.'

1026
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,870
She looked round the room at everyone again.

1027
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:56,620
'The next thing I want to talk about is Ms
Engel's laptop,' she said.

1028
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:59,650
'We've just found it.

1029
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:00,910
In pieces.

1030
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:07,250
Hidden in an old garage at the back of the
hotel.'

1031
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,950
At that moment the door opened.

1032
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:13,350
A police officer said something to DC Fox.

1033
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:16,240
Fox came over to Shepherd and spoke to her
quietly.

1034
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,600
She looked at Johnson.

1035
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,160
'Just what I need,' thought Shepherd.

1036
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,260
A way to make Harriet Johnson talk.

1037
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:32,910
'Ms Johnson, one of the cleaners saw you leaving
the hotel this morning at six thirty.

1038
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,970
You were carrying a laptop bag.

1039
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:44,020
Perhaps you could tell us what you were doing.'

1040
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:52,090
CHAPTER SEVEN
Who killed Claudia Engel?

1041
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,690
Everyone in the room looked at Harriet Johnson.

1042
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,170
'I...' began Johnson.

1043
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,530
Her face turned dark red.

1044
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:03,380
She stopped and then started again.

1045
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:08,570
'I was taking my laptop out to my car,' she
said.

1046
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,380
'This was our last day here.

1047
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:15,600
I knew I didn't need my laptop again, so I
went to put it in my car.

1048
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,450
But it was my laptop.

1049
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,920
You have to believe me.'

1050
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
'Excuse me, Shep.'

1051
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,369
It was Fox who spoke.

1052
01:06:24,369 --> 01:06:29,630
'When we asked to see everyone's laptop, Ms
Johnson's was in her room.'

1053
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:31,230
'Yes, yes,' said Johnson.

1054
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,230
'I know.

1055
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,910
I brought it back.

1056
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:42,570
When I knew we had to stay longer because
of... because of Claudia, I went and got it.

1057
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:46,430
I thought I could do some work.'

1058
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,990
Shepherd looked at Johnson for a few seconds.

1059
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:59,840
'Tell me, Ms Johnson,' she began, her voice
hard, 'tell me everything that you did after

1060
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,680
ten thirty last night.'

1061
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,390
For a moment Johnson didn't speak.

1062
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:10,220
She looked at McNab, then at Shepherd.

1063
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:17,520
'And don't tell me you just went to your room
and went to bed,' said Shepherd, 'because

1064
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,660
I won't believe you.'

1065
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:25,870
Johnson looked down at her hands for a moment
and then up at Shepherd.

1066
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:30,150
'I went to James's room,' she said.

1067
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:36,090
'I wanted to ask him something about a problem
we're having with sales in North America.

1068
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:41,110
I needed to send an email to the States before
I went to bed.

1069
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,280
But James wasn't there.

1070
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:47,710
He didn't come to the door.'

1071
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,590
Johnson looked at McNab.

1072
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:53,619
'I'm sorry, James,' she said.

1073
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:58,410
'Well, Mr McNab?' asked Shepherd.

1074
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:01,290
'Where were you?'

1075
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:06,080
Now McNab's face went red.

1076
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,610
'I was probably in the shower,' he answered.

1077
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:15,770
'I told you I had a shower before I went to
bed.'

1078
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,839
'You didn't go out?' said Shepherd.

1079
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:23,730
'You didn't use the door at the back of the
hotel?'

1080
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:28,420
'No,' he replied.

1081
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,910
Shepherd looked round the room at everyone.

1082
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:36,060
Her fingers started playing with the envelope
on the table in front of her.

1083
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,960
The envelope was open and there was writing
on the front of it.

1084
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,359
She looked back at James McNab.

1085
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,660
'Maybe what you're saying is true; maybe it's
not,' said Shepherd.

1086
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:55,290
'I don't know yet, but one way or another
I'm going to find out.'

1087
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,210
She looked round the room again.

1088
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:01,069
'And I do know this.

1089
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:03,180
Claudia Engel's laptop is important.

1090
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,900
Her killer knows it's important too.

1091
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:13,650
There's something on her computer - an email,
a letter, something like that - something

1092
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:18,060
that will tell me who the killer is.'

1093
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,250
Nobody spoke.

1094
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,900
The room was very quiet.

1095
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:31,040
'I also think Ms Engel knew she was in danger,'
said Shepherd, looking in turn at each of

1096
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,890
the people sitting in front of her.

1097
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:38,810
She turned the envelope over so that everyone
could see the writing on the front.

1098
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:43,850
There were two words: 'Claudia Engel'.

1099
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:51,650
'She left this at the hotel reception yesterday
afternoon,' said Shepherd, opening the envelope

1100
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:52,920
and turning it over.

1101
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,170
A memory stick fell out onto the table in
front of her.

1102
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,360
'Do you know what's on this?'

1103
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,540
she asked and then answered the question herself.

1104
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,320
'Everything that was on her computer.

1105
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:12,970
Claudia put everything important from her
laptop onto this memory stick and gave it

1106
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:15,290
to reception to keep safe.

1107
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:22,880
It could take me some time to find what I'm
looking for - the important email or letter

1108
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,450
- but I will find it.'

1109
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:31,770
Again nobody spoke.

1110
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:35,000
Shepherd watched everyone carefully.

1111
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,940
Johnson's hand went to her mouth.

1112
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:41,790
Chowdury looked like he had a lot of questions
to ask.

1113
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:48,460
Fleming was sitting back in his chair looking
from Shepherd to the MMI people and back again.

1114
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:54,000
But it was McNab who looked most uncomfortable.

1115
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,390
Shepherd watched him carefully.

1116
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,960
At that moment the door opened.

1117
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,850
A police officer gave DC Fox a piece of paper.

1118
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:10,520
Fox passed the paper to Shepherd, who looked
at it, then smiled at Webb.

1119
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,460
Webb looked at her questioningly.

1120
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:17,060
Shepherd looked round the room again.

1121
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:21,520
'You'll be interested to know that one of
my officers has had a look at the door at

1122
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,290
the back of the hotel,' she said.

1123
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:29,860
'He's found quite a few fingerprints on it
from a number of different hands.

1124
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:35,560
We've also found the piece of wood used to
hit Ms Engel, and we're looking for fingerprints

1125
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,360
on that.

1126
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,500
But then, of course, I'm sure the murderer
wore gloves...'

1127
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,730
She stopped speaking for a moment and watched
McNab.

1128
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,869
All the colour left his face.

1129
01:11:49,869 --> 01:11:53,620
'... or maybe not,' finished Shepherd.

1130
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,040
McNab's mouth opened and closed.

1131
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:02,020
He started to speak, then stopped, then started
again.

1132
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:06,710
'Yes, Mr McNab?' said Shepherd quietly.

1133
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:09,710
'I had to,' he said.

1134
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,030
'I just had to.

1135
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,190
She wanted too much.

1136
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,950
She always wanted too much.

1137
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:19,210
She earned good money, but she wanted double.'

1138
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,920
And you didn't want to pay that,' said Shepherd.

1139
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,950
'I couldn't,' said McNab.

1140
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,650
'I couldn't, but she didn't believe me.

1141
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,090
"Double, or else..."

1142
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,150
she said.'

1143
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:32,820
'Or else what?' asked Shepherd.

1144
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:36,411
'She said, "I'll start a new company.

1145
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:41,440
The two new bands will come to me; in time
most of your old bands will come to me too.

1146
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,390
You're finished, James."

1147
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:46,060
That's what she said.'

1148
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:49,370
McNab's voice became stronger.

1149
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:52,210
'I started MMI fifteen years ago.

1150
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,020
I built the company.

1151
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,660
I couldn't let her end it all.

1152
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,630
Not someone like her.'

1153
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:04,790
'So you invited her for a walk on the beach,'
said Shepherd.

1154
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:07,120
'Yes,' said McNab.

1155
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,000
'I told her I was sure we could agree something.

1156
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,380
I went out through the back door so no-one
saw us together.

1157
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,239
Then I met her outside the front of the hotel.'

1158
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:24,210
He pushed his fingers through his hair and
spoke again.

1159
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,800
'I told her I wanted to talk about it.

1160
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,010
I tried one last time.

1161
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:33,180
I said I'd give her fifty percent more money.

1162
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:37,489
"Double or nothing," she said.

1163
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:39,800
She laughed at me.

1164
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,210
That made me so angry.

1165
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,489
She turned her back on me to look out to sea.

1166
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:48,160
There was a piece of wood on the beach.

1167
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,500
I hit her with it.

1168
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,340
Just once.

1169
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,090
She fell.

1170
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,520
It was all over.'

1171
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:03,340
'Then you took her room key, went to her room
and took the laptop,' said Shepherd.

1172
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,220
'Yes,' said McNab.

1173
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:08,920
'I went in and out through the back door again.

1174
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,720
I took the laptop out to that old garage behind
the hotel.

1175
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,400
I broke it up into pieces with a large stone
and hid it.'

1176
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,200
His head went down.

1177
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,420
'Fox,' said Shepherd.

1178
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:29,520
'Get another officer and take Mr McNab to
the police station.'

1179
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,840
She looked at the other people in the room.

1180
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
'OK.

1181
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:38,030
You all need to put in writing what you've
done over the last twenty-four hours.

1182
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:43,070
Then you're free to go.'

1183
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:47,080
Fifteen minutes later Shepherd and Webb were
sitting in the bar.

1184
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:52,470
There was a half-empty glass of red wine in
front of Shepherd, and an orange juice in

1185
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,570
front of Webb.

1186
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,750
Shepherd's fingers were playing with the memory
stick.

1187
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:01,980
'When did I say I wanted someone to look at
the back door?'

1188
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,660
she asked.

1189
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,750
'You didn't,' replied Webb.

1190
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,330
'Good for you,' said Shepherd.

1191
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:12,570
'I like having a sergeant who uses his brain.'

1192
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:19,260
'Well, I knew the killer didn't have much
time to decide how to kill Engel,' said Webb.

1193
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,820
'I just thought it would be a good idea to
look for fingerprints on the back door.

1194
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:30,170
I mean, nobody has gloves with them in September
anyway.'

1195
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,170
Shepherd smiled.

1196
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:36,140
'It's lucky for us too that Claudia Engel
put everything onto the memory stick and left

1197
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,800
it at reception,' said Webb.

1198
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,710
'And that you thought to ask them about it.'

1199
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,210
'It's not lucky at all,' said Shepherd.

1200
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:50,230
'What do you mean?' asked Webb.

1201
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:53,160
'It's not her memory stick,' said Shepherd.

1202
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:59,230
'I borrowed it from reception just before
I talked to that lot.'

1203
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:03,670
'But the writing on the envelope...' said
Webb.

1204
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:08,290
'Engel wrote her name at reception when she
arrived two days ago.

1205
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:11,730
I thought I did quite a good job of making
it look the same.'

1206
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:15,140
'But...' began Webb.

1207
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,560
'You mean...'

1208
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,390
'That's right,' she said.

1209
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:24,920
'McNab believed we knew everything, but actually
we didn't.'

1210
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,030
Shepherd took a drink of her wine.

1211
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,850
'So what was on her computer?' asked Webb.

1212
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,300
'What was so important?'

1213
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,760
'I have no idea,' said Shepherd and laughed.

1214
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,430
'If we're lucky, McNab will tell us.

1215
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:43,810
But if he doesn't, that's OK too.

1216
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,180
He's told us that he killed Engel.

1217
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,630
That's the important thing.

1218
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:52,650
And from the look on his face he didn't bring
any gloves with him.

1219
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:57,210
So we'll probably have his fingerprints too.'

1220
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:01,650
Webb drank some of his orange juice and looked
at Shepherd.

1221
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,960
She really wasn't the usual kind of police
inspector.

1222
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,250
'We found the murderer...'

1223
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,440
Shepherd looked at her watch '... in under
twelve hours.

1224
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,770
I call that a good day's work.

1225
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,770
Well done us!'

1226
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:19,500
Webb smiled.

1227
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:24,470
'Right,' said Shepherd, standing up and finishing
her drink.

1228
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:27,320
'I'm going to give this memory stick back
to reception.

1229
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,610
Mine's another glass of red wine.'

1230
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:29,940
- THE END -
