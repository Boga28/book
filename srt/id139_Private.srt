00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:07,149
CHAPTER ONE
At the Golden Globes

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:15,740
Jack Morgan got out of his dark blue Lamborghini
near the Beverly Hilton.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:26,539
It was the night of the Golden Globes, and
he was with a beautiful and famous movie star.

4
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:34,690
He helped Guinevere Scott-Evans out of the
car, and she held his hand hard.

5
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:43,830
Guinevere trusted Jack, and she trusted his
company, Private.

6
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,870
Everyone trusted Private; it was the best.

7
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:58,490
But then Jack's oldest friend, Andy Cushman,
called him.

8
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,140
Andy spoke quickly.

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,870
"Jack, come to my house now!

10
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,100
I need you."

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,549
"It's not a good time.

12
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,170
What's wrong?" asked Jack.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,490
"It's Shelby.

14
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,409
She's dead," said Andy.

15
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,759
Shelby and Andy married six months ago.

16
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,770
Guinevere wasn't happy, but Jack took her
to her table.

17
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,950
Then, he was on the road to Andy's house in
Bluffs.

18
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:49,939
He stopped near the open front door, took
out his gun, and went in.

19
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,039
"Andy?" shouted Jack.

20
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,850
"Jack!

21
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,490
I'm in the bedroom."

22
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,549
Jack went through the house, his gun in his
hand.

23
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,200
In the bedroom, there were clothes everywhere.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,819
Shelby was on the bed, with blood on her head.

25
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,340
"What happened?" asked Jack.

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,180
Andy was near Shelby, his head in his hands.

27
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,950
"Someone shot her.

28
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,950
Please find him!"

29
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,480
Jack took photos of everything in the room.

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,330
"Did you call the police?" he asked.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,870
"No, I wanted you here," said Andy.

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,950
"Do you have a gun?" asked Jack.

33
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,130
"No," said Andy.

34
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,569
"OK, you must understand.

35
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,560
The police will want to talk to you.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,750
They always want it to be easy.

37
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:17,040
They will think, 'A woman is dead - did her
husband kill her?'

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,870
But I can help," said Jack.

39
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,450
He called the police and waited for them to
arrive.

40
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,200
CHAPTER TWO
A young woman dies

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,769
Justine worked with Jack at Private.

42
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,120
People trusted her, too.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,590
Tonight, she was in an expensive Italian restaurant.

44
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,370
Then, the chief of police called her.

45
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,720
"Another young woman is dead," Justine told
her friend.

46
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,010
"I must go."

47
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:11,370
In two years, eleven young women in Los Angeles
were dead.

48
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,569
Now, it was twelve.

49
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:23,620
The killer always took something from the
women - hair, a necklace, clothes.

50
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,490
Then, the killer emailed the chief of police
and told him about the women's things.

51
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:46,110
Nobody knew where the emails came from, but
the emails all had the same name - Steemcleena.

52
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:54,110
The police found the women's things, but they
couldn't find Steemcleena.

53
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:02,500
The police wanted Justine, and Private, to
help them find the killer.

54
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:11,720
Emilio Cruz, from Private, stopped his Mercedes
at the restaurant door, and Justine got in.

55
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,090
"What do you know about this girl?" asked
Justine.

56
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,520
"Her name is Connie Yu.

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,370
She was sixteen and very intelligent," said
Emilio.

58
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,789
"She was on the ground behind a restaurant.

59
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,270
There was an earring in her left ear.

60
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,050
There was no right ear."

61
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,690
Emilio stopped in a small, dark street near
some police cars.

62
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,620
They walked past the police and spoke to the
doctor.

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:04,660
"We'll get an email about the ear in a day
or two," Emilio said.

64
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,850
At 2 a.m., Justine and Emilio were at Private's
offices.

65
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,009
They talked to Sci, Private's forensic expert.

66
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,220
"We have the woman's bag and cell phone,"
said Justine.

67
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,360
"Can you look for DNA on them?"

68
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:38,300
"Of course," said Sci. "I can work all night
on it."

69
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,840
CHAPTER THREE
At Private

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:54,960
The next morning, Justine, Emilio, Sci, and
Mo-bot, the computer expert, were in the office.

71
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,870
Jack opened his laptop and showed them the
photos from Andy's bedroom.

72
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,520
"Look at these," he said.

73
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,110
"I can't see anything important.

74
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
Can you?"

75
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:19,280
"Did the killer take anything from the house?"
asked Justine.

76
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,340
"No, he took nothing," said Jack.

77
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:33,000
"And were Andy and Shelby happy together?"
asked Emilio.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,930
"Yes," said Jack.

79
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,550
"Very happy."

80
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,810
"OK," said Justine.

81
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,610
"This killer is a professional.

82
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,570
But why did he kill Shelby?"

83
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,430
"The police always like easy answers.

84
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,919
They will think one thing: Andy killed her,"
said Emilio.

85
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
"Did Andy kill her?"

86
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,390
"No, he didn't," said Jack.

87
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,039
"I know Andy well.

88
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,990
He loved Shelby."

89
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,760
"What next?" asked Mo-bot.

90
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,290
"We look at Andy and Shelby," said Jack.

91
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,259
"We talk to their friends and to people they
work with.

92
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,409
Let's go."

93
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,110
"Wait!" said Justine.

94
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,250
"I have some news on the young woman.

95
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,760
We have her bag.

96
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Sci couldn't find any new DNA, but Mo-bot
looked at her phone."

97
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,130
"I looked at the text messages," said Mo-bot.

98
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,360
"There were hundreds, from twenty or thirty
people.

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,310
I looked at the numbers, and they are all
friends or family.

100
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,631
But there is one strange message - I can't
get the number for it.

101
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:18,631
Look!"

102
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:25,840
A text message came up on the wall.

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,670
Connie.

104
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,610
It's Linda.

105
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,060
My mom took my phone.

106
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,010
I must talk to you.

107
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,300
Can we meet?

108
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,970
Please!

109
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,060
Behind the restaurant.

110
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,570
At 8.30 p.m.

111
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,420
Don't tell anyone.

112
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,339
"I talked to Linda," said Mo-bot.

113
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,480
"Her mother didn't take her phone.

114
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Linda didn't send that message.

115
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,389
The killer got into Connie's phone and found
all her friends.

116
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:15,540
Then, he sent her that message from his phone."

117
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:26,930
"But we can't find the number of the killer's
phone," said Sci. "It isn't possible."

118
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,170
"Who is Steemcleena?"

119
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,560
asked Jack.

120
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:42,950
Rudolph Crocker left his office at 7 p.m.
and went for a drink.

121
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,310
At 9 p.m., he was at home and ready for a
run.

122
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,910
He ran out to Marina del Rey and thought about
Connie Yu.

123
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,810
That was a great evening.

124
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,760
There was nobody near him.

125
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,040
He stopped near a boat and put something on
it.

126
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,860
Then, he went home and sent an email to the
Chief of Police.

127
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:23,910
You can find Connie Yu's ear on a boat in
Marina del Rey.

128
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,220
Steemcleena.

129
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,470
CHAPTER FOUR
Another young woman

130
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,790
Jason Pilser got a text message at work at
3 p.m.

131
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,550
Scylla, your big night is Saturday.

132
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,590
Be ready.

133
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,110
Steemcleena.

134
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,010
"Scylla" was Jason's computer name.

135
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:01,290
At 6 p.m., he left his office and drove to
a store.

136
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,300
He bought some gloves and some electric cable.

137
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,339
He didn't pay with a card, and he looked down
at the ground.

138
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:18,339
He didn't want the cameras in the store to
see him.

139
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:21,920
The big night was in three days.

140
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,740
He was ready to kill his first woman.

141
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,029
"I'm going for a walk!"

142
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,600
Marguerite Esperanza shouted to her grandmother.

143
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,730
It was Saturday evening.

144
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,740
Marguerite walked out the house and on to
Rowena Avenue.

145
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,860
A text message came on to her phone.

146
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,270
Hi Marg.

147
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,950
It's Lamar.

148
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,839
Where are you?

149
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,540
She read it and answered.

150
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,089
I'm on Rowena.

151
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:07,160
Lamar was a really nice boy.

152
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,089
Marguerite liked him.

153
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:16,850
Do you want to get a pizza? asked Lamar.

154
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,920
OK, Marguerite answered.

155
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,519
Marguerite called her grandmother.

156
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,370
"I'm getting a pizza with Lamar," she said.

157
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,529
"And he'll walk home with me.

158
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,050
Is that OK?"

159
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,280
The black van was near Rowena Avenue.

160
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,350
The driver was Steemcleena.

161
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,520
Scylla and Morbid were in the back of the
van.

162
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,699
"She's out of her house," said Morbid.

163
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,459
He gave the laptop to Scylla.

164
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,860
Scylla wrote a message: Hi Marg.

165
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,139
It's Lamar...

166
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,360
Marguerite answered.

167
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,940
Scylla wrote another message.

168
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,990
The van stopped near the pizza restaurant
and waited.

169
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,100
Then, they saw Marguerite in the street.

170
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,990
"Go!" shouted Morbid.

171
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,019
Scylla got out of the van.

172
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:40,899
He pulled a bag over Marguerite's head from
behind, and he and Morbid threw her into the

173
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,540
van.

174
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,230
Steemcleena drove away quickly.

175
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,790
"Help!" shouted Marguerite.

176
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,540
"Be quiet!"

177
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,320
shouted Morbid.

178
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,050
"Maybe you can win the game."

179
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,730
"Win?" asked Marguerite.

180
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,769
"What do you mean?"

181
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:15,050
Steemcleena stopped the van in a park, with
nobody near.

182
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,490
Morbid and Steemcleena were behind Scylla.

183
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,170
This was Scylla's game.

184
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:32,970
Marguerite got out of the van quickly, and
she pulled the bag off her head.

185
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:39,190
She couldn't run away; Steemcleena and Morbid
could stop her.

186
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,600
But she was tall and strong, and ready for
Scylla.

187
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,829
Her hand flew out and hit him on the nose.

188
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:57,930
There was blood on Scylla's face now, and
he was angry.

189
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,800
He ran at her, but she kicked him hard in
the stomach.

190
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,240
And then she kicked him again.

191
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,029
Steemcleena looked at Morbid.

192
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:17,020
"She's too good for Scylla," he said.

193
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:23,120
He took out a gun and shot Marguerite in the
head.

194
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:32,440
Then, Scylla put on the gloves and put the
cable around the dead woman's neck.

195
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,610
He took her shoes and put them in the van.

196
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,450
"That wasn't good," said Steemcleena to Scylla.

197
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:50,870
"But maybe you'll win the next game."

198
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:57,160
CHAPTER FIVE
Scylla's next game

199
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:05,270
Justine met Police Lieutenant Nora Cronin
in the park at 4 a.m. on Sunday.

200
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,810
"The Chief of Police is here," said Nora.

201
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,900
"He wants to talk to you."

202
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,500
The Chief was with three police officers near
Marguerite's body.

203
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,220
Justine walked up to him.

204
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,210
"It's good to see you," he said.

205
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,040
"We need your help.

206
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,620
Thirteen women are dead.

207
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,610
And look!

208
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:44,330
Somebody shot her dead - so why is there cable
around her neck?"

209
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,890
"It's very strange," said Justine.

210
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,080
"And where's her handbag?"

211
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:00,720
"There's no handbag," said the Chief, "and
no shoes.

212
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,570
I'm waiting for the email."

213
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:15,120
On Sunday evening, Scylla was on the terrace
of his apartment, at the top of a tall building.

214
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,780
The city was beautiful at night, but he didn't
look at it.

215
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,580
His face and body were black and blue.

216
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,950
"That girl was strong," he thought.

217
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,820
Then, he read the message from Morbid again.

218
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,600
You weren't good yesterday, Scylla.

219
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,470
Steemcleena isn't happy.

220
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,760
But you can play again tonight.

221
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,370
We have someone for you.

222
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:56,080
Be ready at 7 p.m.

223
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,170
Morbid and Steemcleena were at the door now,
and Scylla went to open it.

224
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:09,760
"How's the nose?" asked Morbid.

225
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
OK, said Scylla.

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,460
"Do you want a drink?"

227
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,840
"No," said Steemcleena.

228
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,730
"Let's go on the terrace.

229
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,550
I want to show you something."

230
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:33,070
The three men walked on to the terrace and
looked down at the city.

231
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,890
Then, Steemcleena turned to Scylla.

232
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,170
"You think you can play again?" he asked.

233
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,230
"You can.

234
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,570
But you're playing with us."

235
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:59,350
Steemcleena took Scylla's legs, and Morbid
took his arms, and they threw him over the

236
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,260
terrace wall.

237
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,470
Justine and Jack were at Private with Mo-bot.

238
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,660
They talked about Marguerite.

239
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:19,890
"The killer sent an email," said Justine,
"and we found her shoes.

240
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:25,310
Sci is looking at them now, but they're probably
clean."

241
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:35,670
"The killer is using a van to look for the
young women, I think," said Mo-bot.

242
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:47,650
"He has a laptop and a radio in the van, and
he can send messages to the women's cell phones.

243
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:54,030
He can stop messages to their phones from
other people, too.

244
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,910
And maybe he can find them in the street from
their phones."

245
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,720
"Is that possible?" asked Jack.

246
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,970
"I don't know.

247
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,700
I'll ask Sci about it," said Mo-bot.

248
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,390
"His friend Kit-Kat knows about cell phones."

249
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:25,360
"I remembered something important," said Justine.

250
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:34,030
"Someone killed a woman about five years ago
in the same street as Connie Yu.

251
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,430
Her name was Wendy Borman.

252
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,890
The killer took her phone.

253
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,830
And her necklace."

254
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,720
"Five years ago!" said Jack.

255
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,180
"Maybe it's not thirteen women.

256
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,230
Maybe it's more!

257
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,550
We have work to do!"

258
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:06,840
CHAPTER SIX
An angry husband can kill

259
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,590
On Monday morning, Andy was at Private.

260
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,470
Jack had something to tell him.

261
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,110
"I can't sleep," Andy said.

262
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,790
"I think about Shelby all the time."

263
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,590
"Andy," said Jack.

264
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,330
"We talked to a lot of people about Shelby.

265
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,660
She had a lot of friends - you know that.

266
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,090
And we found one very good friend.

267
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,670
The movie star Bob Santangelo.

268
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,290
She saw him every week."

269
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,770
"That's not true!"

270
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,270
shouted Andy.

271
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,080
"She loved me."

272
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,750
"Maybe she loved you," said Jack.

273
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,420
"But she loved Santangelo, too.

274
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,300
Did you know that?"

275
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,910
"No, I didn't!"

276
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,570
shouted Andy.

277
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,790
"It's not true!"

278
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,970
Andy left.

279
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,810
Jack and Sci talked about Santangelo.

280
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,960
"Did Andy know about Santangelo?"

281
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,640
asked Sci.

282
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,510
"I don't know," said Jack.

283
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,520
"An angry husband can kill, you know," said
Sci.

284
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,820
"I know, Sci," said Jack.

285
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,140
"But Andy's a good man, and he's my friend.

286
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,960
He didn't kill Shelby."

287
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,920
"I understand.

288
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,530
You don't want to hear it," said Sci.

289
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,020
"But maybe he did."

290
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,370
Justine was at the police station with Lieutenant
Nora Cronin.

291
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:21,890
"I looked on the internet," said Justine,
"but can you tell me more about Wendy Borman?"

292
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,520
"One thing isn't on the internet," said Nora.

293
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,420
"An eleven-year-old girl called Christine
Castiglia saw something.

294
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:41,060
She and her mother were in a coffee shop on
Melrose Avenue.

295
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,620
Christine saw two boys push Wendy into a van.

296
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:53,530
Her mother didn't see anything, and Christine
didn't see a lot.

297
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,000
The boys were white.

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,610
One had a long nose and big ears; the other
had long hair."

299
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,890
"But Christine is sixteen now," said Justine.

300
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:14,140
"We need to talk to her again."

301
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,920
CHAPTER SEVEN
Help from Sci's friends

302
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,290
Sci lived in an apartment with a lot of computers.

303
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:34,730
On Monday evening, he sat at a computer and
talked to his friend Kit-Kat in Sweden.

304
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:40,370
"You asked about cell phones," said Kit-Kat.

305
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,680
"I can help.

306
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,590
Someone in the United States of America has
a new program.

307
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,760
It can find a phone and get inside it.

308
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,330
Then, it can send messages from the phone.

309
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:04,220
And nobody knows it is happening."

310
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:14,410
"That's great, Kit-Kat," said Sci. "Do you
know who made this program?"

311
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,370
"His name is Morbid.

312
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,610
He's American, I think."

313
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,090
"Thanks, Kit-Kat.

314
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,580
You're wonderful!"

315
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,560
Then, Sci sent a message to his friend Darren,
who was in India.

316
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,210
Darren played games on computers.

317
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,620
Do you know a player called Morbid?

318
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
Yes.

319
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,590
I saw a message from a player called Scylla
about Morbid.

320
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,390
On Saturday.

321
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,900
What did he say?

322
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,240
He said: "I'm playing a new game with Morbid."

323
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,030
Then, there was a message from Morbid the
next day.

324
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,090
"Scylla can fly.

325
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,640
He flew off his terrace.

326
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,080
Flying is easy, but the streets are hard."

327
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,580
Sci looked on the internet.

328
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,790
On Sunday, a man fell off a terrace in Los
Angeles and died.

329
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,960
His name was Jason Pilser.

330
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,800
"Was that Scylla?"

331
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,360
Sci thought.

332
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,260
Sci met Jack in a coffee shop early on Tuesday
morning.

333
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,780
"Jack, I have some news.

334
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,110
Lots of people like playing games on the internet.

335
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:04,840
In some of these games, you kill people, but
you're playing - it's a game.

336
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:14,680
I think some men in Los Angeles are playing
a game, but they are really killing people.

337
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,660
Not on the computer, but on the streets."

338
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,080
"Who are these men?" asked Jack.

339
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,700
"One man is - was - Jason Pilser.

340
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,480
His computer name was Scylla.

341
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,910
Another man is Morbid.

342
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,390
Scylla died on Sunday night.

343
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,630
The police say he fell off his terrace.

344
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,020
But maybe someone pushed him."

345
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:56,490
"Let's go to his apartment," said Jack.

346
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:05,310
Jack and Sci met Nora at the apartment building,
and they went up together.

347
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,230
There wasn't anything interesting in the living
room.

348
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:15,310
But in the bedroom were a laptop and a cell
phone.

349
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,650
"I'll take the computer back to Mo-bot," said
Sci.

350
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,990
"But I'll look at the phone now."

351
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,720
He started to read the text messages.

352
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,710
"Jack, look at this."

353
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,130
Sci gave the phone to Jack.

354
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,220
It's tonight, Scylla.

355
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,010
You're the killer.

356
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,020
Steemcleena

357
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,460
"It's from Steemcleena!" said Jack.

358
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,660
"He's working in a group!"

359
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:01,380
CHAPTER EIGHT
They're going to kill again

360
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,230
Justine took the police photos of Wendy Borman's
body to the office at Private.

361
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,850
She also took a bag of Wendy's clothes.

362
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,730
"Sci can look at those," she thought.

363
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,220
"There may be DNA on them!"

364
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,440
Justine looked at the photos of Wendy, dead,
behind the restaurant.

365
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:38,500
Five years ago, the police found Wendy's bag
next to her, but her necklace was not there.

366
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:45,490
Wendy always wore the necklace, and Justine
found a photo of it.

367
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,540
It had a star on it.

368
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:55,610
Then, she went to find Christine Castiglia
in school.

369
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,950
Justine found Christine in the school restaurant.

370
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,270
"Do you remember Wendy Borman?"

371
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,630
she asked.

372
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,560
"I was only eleven," said Christine.

373
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,710
"Yes, but can you remember anything?

374
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,090
What did you see?" asked Justine.

375
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:26,810
"A van stopped, and two boys got out and pushed
a girl into the back.

376
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,380
Then, they drove away.

377
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,750
It was very quick," said Christine.

378
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,410
"And you saw the driver?" said Justine.

379
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,000
"He had a long nose.

380
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,470
And big ears," said Christine.

381
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,880
"And the van?" said Justine.

382
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,170
"It was black.

383
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:01,360
I remember a word on it: Gateway," said Christine.

384
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,320
Gateway.

385
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,240
This was new.

386
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,700
Gateway was an expensive school in Santa Monica.

387
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:15,130
"Thank you, Christine," said Justine.

388
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:21,330
Sci worked for hours on Wendy Borman's clothes.

389
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:29,150
He looked for DNA and he found it - from two
different men.

390
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,170
"Yes!" he said.

391
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,960
He heard someone at the door, and Mo-bot ran
into his office.

392
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,960
"Sci, they are going to kill again.

393
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,080
This week!

394
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,640
I looked at Jason's computer.

395
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,330
There were thousands of messages, and I read
them all.

396
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,530
Look at this one!"

397
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,630
Morbid, Scylla.

398
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,940
Here's the next woman.

399
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,760
She lives in Silver Lake, and her name is
Graciella.

400
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
Steemcleena

401
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,110
There was a photo of a young woman.

402
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:20,880
"I'll call Jack," said Sci.

403
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,260
CHAPTER NINE
Help from Carmine Noccia

404
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,060
On Tuesday afternoon, Jack was in his office
with Emilio.

405
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:40,060
They knew something about the young women's
killers now, but nothing about Shelby's.

406
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,590
"Andy isn't a killer," Jack said.

407
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,670
"Shelby's killer was a professional.

408
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:55,370
There was no DNA, no gun, nothing.

409
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,430
We need to talk to Carmine Noccia in Las Vegas."

410
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:11,090
Carmine and his family knew every professional
killer from California to Florida.

411
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,250
Jack didn't often work with men like Carmine.

412
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:24,060
But, once, Carmine asked for Private's help
- his daughter ran away, and he wanted her

413
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,980
back.

414
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,160
Jack found her.

415
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,010
Carmine never forgot a friend.

416
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,190
"We'll fly to Las Vegas," Jack said.

417
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:46,570
Carmine was very rich, and his home was in
a park, half an hour from the airport.

418
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:54,500
Two big men came to meet Jack and Emilio at
the door and took their guns from them.

419
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,710
Carmine was in the sitting room.

420
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,140
"Good to see you, Jack," said Carmine.

421
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,590
"I need your help," said Jack.

422
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,670
"Jack, you helped me, and I'll help you.

423
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,650
But don't ask again," said Carmine.

424
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:29,020
"Someone killed my friend Shelby Cushman in
Los Angeles - a professional.

425
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,540
Who was the killer, do you know?" said Jack.

426
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,130
"I don't know.

427
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,940
But I can ask.

428
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:46,170
I'll call you when I know," said Carmine.

429
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,190
The call from Carmine came late at night.

430
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:57,420
He only said two words: "Bo Montgomery."

431
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,740
Jack called Emilio early Wednesday morning.

432
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,490
Emilio said he knew Bo Montgomery.

433
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:14,970
Bo was a professional killer, and he lived
on a horse farm in the Agoura Hills.

434
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,770
Jack and Emilio drove there fast.

435
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,540
They stopped near the farmhouse.

436
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,500
A door opened slowly, and a man came out.

437
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,210
He had a big dog, and in his arms was an AK-47.

438
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,550
"What do you want?" he asked.

439
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,560
"I'm Jack Morgan, from Private.

440
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm working for Andy Cushman.

441
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,050
Someone killed his wife, Shelby.

442
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,310
Who paid for that?"

443
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,290
Bo Montgomery thought for a minute and then
spoke slowly.

444
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,770
"I don't know Shelby Cushman.

445
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,650
I don't know any women in Bluffs."

446
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:17,610
Then, he wrote a name on the ground with the
end of his gun.

447
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,980
Jack looked at the name, and then Bo kicked
it away.

448
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,440
"Goodbye, Mr Morgan," he said.

449
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,820
"And please, drive slowly.

450
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:37,270
The horses get frightened."

451
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:42,390
CHAPTER TEN
DNA

452
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:49,940
Christine Castiglia wanted to meet Justine
again, on Wednesday after school.

453
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:57,270
"Let's go to the coffee shop on Melrose Avenue,"
said Christine.

454
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:03,290
"I'll remember better there about the boys
and the van."

455
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,020
"Great," said Justine.

456
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,190
The coffee shop was the same as five years
before.

457
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:17,210
"My mum and I sat here," said Christine.

458
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,870
She went to a table near the window.

459
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:29,660
Justine had yearbooks for three years from
Gateway school with photos of all the students.

460
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,820
She put them on the table.

461
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,260
"Can you look at these?

462
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,130
Maybe one of the boys is there."

463
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,150
Christine turned the pages of the yearbooks.

464
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,920
She stopped and looked at a photo of a group
of boys.

465
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,540
"That's him!"

466
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,040
she said.

467
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,510
She showed Justine.

468
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,300
The boy had a long nose and big ears.

469
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,510
Justine looked at the name under the photo.

470
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,520
Rudolph Crocker.

471
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,119
"Great job, Christine!"

472
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,630
she said.

473
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,550
She opened her laptop and looked for Rudolph
Crocker.

474
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,710
There were two in Los Angeles.

475
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,540
The first was sixty-six years old.

476
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,880
The second worked for a small company on Wilshire
Boulevard.

477
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,950
And there was a photo of him.

478
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:37,240
It was the boy, five years older.

479
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,560
Now, Justine needed his DNA.

480
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,240
Justine went to see Nora Cronin at the police
station.

481
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,080
"We have DNA from Wendy Borman's clothes,"
she told her.

482
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,950
"It's from two men, but we don't know them.

483
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,880
But I talked to Christine Castiglia.

484
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,410
We looked at some photos, and she saw this
boy.

485
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,620
He pushed Wendy Borman into the van.

486
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,150
Look!"

487
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,850
She showed Nora a photo on her computer.

488
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,950
"His name is Rudolph Crocker.

489
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:29,360
He's twenty-three now, and he lives and works
in Los Angeles."

490
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,110
"Maybe this is Steemcleena.

491
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:37,480
And you want his DNA?" said Nora.

492
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,060
"Yes.

493
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,700
Can you help me?" said Justine.

494
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,160
Nora and Justine stopped their car near Crocker's
apartment building.

495
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,760
They watched and waited.

496
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,580
Crocker left the apartment at 6 p.m. and went
for a run.

497
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:10,540
He came home, and at 8 p.m. he came out and
got into a new, dark blue Toyota van.

498
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,360
He drove to a bar called Whiskey Blue and
went in.

499
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,200
The two women went into the bar after him.

500
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,290
There were a lot of people in the bar.

501
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,800
Crocker was in the corner with a man with
long hair.

502
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,260
Justine bought drinks, and the two women watched.

503
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:41,380
Half an hour later, the men finished their
drinks and left.

504
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:49,290
Nora and Justine quickly went to the men's
table and took the glasses.

505
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:57,770
In the car, Justine called Sci. "Can you meet
us at Private in twenty minutes?"

506
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,770
she asked.

507
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:03,440
"We have some DNA for you!"

508
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:14,280
Late on Wednesday, Jack and Emilio drove back
to the city from the Agoura Hills.

509
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,230
Jack left Emilio at his apartment and went
to see Andy Cushman.

510
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,340
"Jack, why are you here now?

511
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,250
It's 1 a.m.

512
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,120
You look tired!" said Andy.

513
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,640
"I am tired," said Jack.

514
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,250
"Today, I drove to the Agoura Hills.

515
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,560
How much did you pay Bo Montgomery to kill
Shelby?"

516
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,250
Andy started to cry.

517
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,310
"You don't understand, Jack," he said.

518
00:42:55,310 --> 00:43:01,620
"She was with another man, that movie star.

519
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,110
I couldn't live with that!"

520
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:09,480
Jack didn't speak.

521
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:17,390
He hit Andy in the face, three times, and
left.

522
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,360
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A dark blue van

523
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:30,020
The next morning, Sci had news for Justine
and Nora about the DNA.

524
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:36,210
"I have DNA from one of the glasses," he said.

525
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:40,100
"Not Crocker's glass, the other man's.

526
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,860
It's the same as the DNA on Wendy Borman's
clothes."

527
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,920
"Who is this other man?" asked Justine.

528
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,960
"We don't know him.

529
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,630
Is it Morbid?"

530
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,150
"Maybe.

531
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,250
And what did you get from Crocker's glass?"

532
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,570
Nora asked Sci.

533
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,750
"I couldn't get DNA from Crocker's glass.

534
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,690
It was too dirty," said Sci.

535
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,110
Justine looked at Nora.

536
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,270
"What now?"

537
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,550
she asked.

538
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:25,370
"We must find Crocker!" said Nora.

539
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:33,710
Mo-bot worked all morning on her computer,
and then she found something.

540
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,740
She called Jack.

541
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,180
"Morbid wants to kill Graciella tonight!

542
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,850
He's sending her text messages from a friend,
Lulu.

543
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,370
Graciella is answering these messages from
Lulu.

544
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:58,670
She says, 'See you after school', but I don't
know where they are meeting."

545
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:04,040
"Where is Morbid?" asked Jack.

546
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,420
"I don't know," said Mo-bot.

547
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,590
Justine and Nora drove to Crocker's office
on Wilshire Boulevard.

548
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:24,930
"Mr. Crocker is on vacation today," said the
woman at the desk.

549
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:30,060
They drove fast to his apartment, but he wasn't
there.

550
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,300
"Let's find his van!" said Nora.

551
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,100
Nora called the police station.

552
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:44,710
"We're looking for a new, dark blue Toyota
van.

553
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,460
Every police car must look for it."

554
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:56,390
Then, she and Justine waited in their car
near Crocker's apartment building.

555
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,290
The call came back to Nora.

556
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:04,670
"The dark blue van is in Silver Lake.

557
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,070
It was on Alvarado Street, but we can't find
it now."

558
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,600
"We must stop that van!"

559
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,900
shouted Nora into the radio.

560
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,790
"The driver is a killer!"

561
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,130
Jack and Emilio were on the road, too.

562
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,510
Mo-bot called Jack.

563
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:33,590
"I'm reading more messages from Morbid to
Graciella," she told him.

564
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,520
"She's in Glendale, and he wants to meet at
Ralph's Supermarket."

565
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,440
Graciella was in the street near the supermarket.

566
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,280
Morbid walked up to her.

567
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,840
"Graciella?" he said.

568
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,460
"I'm a friend of Lulu's.

569
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,680
She's in hospital.

570
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,190
Can you come with me to visit her?

571
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,740
She wants to see you."

572
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,210
Morbid put his hand on Graciella's arm.

573
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:15,870
Jack ran across the street and hit him in
the stomach.

574
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,900
Morbid fell down, and Jack held him.

575
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,860
"Where's Rudolph Crocker?"

576
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,600
shouted Jack.

577
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,910
Nora and Justine got to Glendale quickly,
too.

578
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:37,180
Crocker's van was behind the supermarket,
with a police car next to it.

579
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,610
Nora talked to a police officer.

580
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,990
"Crocker is in the van, Lieutenant," he said.

581
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,690
"He won't open the doors."

582
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,020
Justine walked up to the van.

583
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,000
Crocker was sitting with his hands on his
head.

584
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,810
"Get out of the van, Crocker," she said.

585
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,550
He smiled at her.

586
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:08,640
Justine hit the van window hard with her gun.

587
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,930
She put her hand into the van, opened the
door, and pulled Crocker out.

588
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:20,910
There was blood and glass everywhere.

589
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:26,250
At the supermarket, the police took Morbid
away.

590
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,420
Jack and Emilio walked to Crocker's van.

591
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,380
They found Justine with her foot on Crocker's
back.

592
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,150
"Are you OK?" asked Jack.

593
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,460
"There's a lot of blood on you."

594
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,050
"It's not mine," said Justine.

595
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,750
"It's Crocker's."

596
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,230
Jack put some glass with blood on it in a
bag and gave it to Emilio.

597
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,119
"Get this to Sci," he said.

598
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,750
"There's DNA here."

599
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,850
The police took Crocker away.

600
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,960
Justine looked at Nora.

601
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:16,910
"We need to go to his apartment and look for
Wendy Borman's necklace."

602
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:22,560
Justine and Nora looked everywhere in Crocker's
apartment.

603
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,060
They found nothing.

604
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:31,340
Justine opened the closet in the bedroom to
look at Crocker's clothes again.

605
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,340
The light was on a string, and she pulled
it.

606
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,170
She looked at the end of the string in her
hand.

607
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,890
It was the star from Wendy's necklace.

608
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:54,230
"We've caught them, Justine," said Jack, back
at Private.

609
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:59,140
"Sci looked at the DNA from Crocker's blood.

610
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:05,360
It's the same as the DNA from Wendy's clothes."

611
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,310
The next morning, Jack's phone woke him early.

612
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,240
"Jack, it's Carmine Noccia.

613
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,000
I have some bad news for you.

614
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,140
Your friend Andy Cushman is dead.

615
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:29,020
His car went off the road near Marin, and
it went into the ocean."

616
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:36,990
"Did anybody see Andy's car go into the ocean?"
said Jack.

617
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,869
"Oh, yes.

618
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,680
One of my cousins saw it.

619
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,430
He was the only person there.

620
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:51,750
Have a good day," said Carmine.

621
00:50:51,750 --> 00:51:00,100
Jack looked at his phone for a minute and
thought, "Carmine's cousin killed Andy."

622
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,710
Then, he turned and threw it out of the window.

623
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,320
It was time for a new phone and a new phone
number.

624
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,970
- THE END -
