1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:08,410
Once upon a time, there was a queen who had
only one beautiful daughter.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,639
She loved the girl very much.

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:21,730
At last, the day came for the princess to
go far away and marry a prince.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,520
The queen was sad to say goodbye.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:35,300
She gave her daughter some beautiful dresses,
a gold cup, and many other things.

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,620
She gave her a magic horse.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,300
It was a white horse and it could talk.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,470
'I love this horse, Mother,' the princess
said.

9
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,080
'I will call it Falada!'

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:02,210
And the queen gave her daughter a maid to
ride with her.

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:09,760
Then the queen made three drops of blood fall
onto a handkerchief.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,360
'Take this,' she said to her daughter.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,470
'It will help you.

14
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,820
It will make you strong.

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,750
Now goodbye, daughter.

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,000
And be happy!'

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,550
The princess took the handkerchief with the
three drops of blood.

18
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,830
She put it inside her dress.

19
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,710
'Goodbye, Mother!'

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,710
she said.

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,760
'Thank you for everything!'

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,979
The queen watched them ride away down the
long hill.

23
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,870
It was a very hot day.

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,689
Soon the princess was thirsty.

25
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:08,110
They were near a stream and so she asked her
maid, 'Maid!

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,660
Please will you get me a drink of water in
my gold cup?'

27
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,980
But the maid said angrily, 'No!

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,739
I will not!

29
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,370
You get off your horse and get it!

30
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,820
I will not be your maid!'

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,450
The princess did not know what to say.

32
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:43,099
So she got off her horse and went to the stream
and drank.

33
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,290
Then they rode on.

34
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:53,590
But the sun was warm and later she asked again,
'Maid!

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,270
Please will you get me a drink of water in
my gold cup?'

36
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,610
And again the maid said angrily, 'No!

37
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,160
I will not!

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
You get off your horse and get it!

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,390
I will not be your maid!'

40
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,300
The princess did not know what to say.

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,750
So she got off her horse and went to the stream
and drank.

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,480
But this time the handkerchief fell into the
water.

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,450
'Ah!

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,610
That's good!'

45
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,760
thought the maid.

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,769
'There is no one here.

47
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:49,770
And now she has nothing to help her.'

48
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:57,520
So she said to the princess, 'Take off that
dress and give it to me!

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,849
You can wear my grey one.

50
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,020
Be quick now or I will kill you!

51
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,230
And I will have Falada.

52
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,540
I am going to be the princess.

53
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,819
I am going to be the bride.

54
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,259
And you are going to be my maid!'

55
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,930
So they rode on.

56
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,440
The maid rode in front on Falada.

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,309
The princess rode behind her on the old grey
horse.

58
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:39,889
In the evening, they arrived at the castle.

59
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,319
The king and his son, the prince, came to
meet them.

60
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:52,009
'How do you do, Princess?' said the king to
the maid.

61
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,960
'This is my son, the prince!'

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,129
The real princess was left outside, but the
king saw her.

63
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:09,499
'Who is that girl?' he thought.

64
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:14,020
'She has a beautiful face!'

65
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,770
'Who are you?' asked the king.

66
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:30,869
'I came here as a maid,' the real princess
answered, 'but you have many maids and you

67
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,639
do not need me.'

68
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,319
'I can find some work for you.

69
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,660
You can be a goose girl,' said the king.

70
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,339
'Come with me.'

71
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,849
He took her to a little house near the castle
gate.

72
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:58,139
'This is Kirsten's house,' he said.

73
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,310
'She looks after the geese!

74
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,449
Kirsten!

75
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,599
Come!

76
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:10,300
Here's a nice girl to help you!

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,259
Give her some food and a bed, please.'

78
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,550
That night there was a big dinner at the castle.

79
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:31,460
'This princess is going to be my son's bride,'
said the king.

80
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:37,509
They will marry in three weeks.'

81
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:44,240
The maid looked at all the people and smiled.

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,970
Later that night she spoke to the prince.

83
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,399
'I have something to tell you,' she said.

84
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,789
That white horse, Falada, is a bad horse.

85
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,789
It's mad!

86
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,229
You must kill it!'

87
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:13,749
She was afraid because Falada could talk.

88
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:20,889
'Yes, my bride,' said the prince, 'if you
want that.

89
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:27,309
I will tell my men to take it away.'

90
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:31,649
The real princess heard about this.

91
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,069
She had one gold coin.

92
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:41,849
She ran to the men and said, 'Take this gold
coin.

93
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,709
Do something for me.

94
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,479
Do you see this dead horse?

95
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,659
Put this horse's head by the big castle gate.'

96
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,349
'What?' they said.

97
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:02,039
'That's a mad idea!

98
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,740
Why?'

99
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,080
'Because I loved that horse,' she said.

100
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,289
'I want to see its face.'

101
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:17,379
The men liked her.

102
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,959
So they took the gold coin.

103
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:27,639
And they put Falada's head by the castle gate.

104
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:37,529
Every day Kirsten took the geese out to the
meadow, and the real princess went with her.

105
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,090
They walked through the castle gate.

106
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,870
And every day the real princess spoke to Falada's
head.

107
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,140
'Falada!

108
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,140
My horse...

109
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,449
do you know me?'

110
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,550
'Yes, Princess!'

111
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,400
the head answered.

112
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,500
'You are the true bride!'

113
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,209
Kirsten did not like it.

114
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,389
She thought it was very strange.

115
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:20,300
Every day the real princess brushed her long
gold hair.

116
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,130
And Kirsten always said, 'Give me some of
your hair!

117
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,310
Oh, come on!

118
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,310
Cut some off and give it to me!'

119
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:40,740
And the real princess always said, 'No, Kirsten!

120
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,360
Stop it!'

121
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,269
But Kirsten wouldn't stop it.

122
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:51,970
So the real princess had to sing to the wind.

123
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,560
'Blow, wind.

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,860
Blow!'

125
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,339
she sang.

126
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:12,819
'Blow Kirsten's hat, blow it over there, so
I have time to brush my hair!'

127
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:19,240
Then a wind came and blew Kirsten's hat off.

128
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,640
Kirsten had to run all over the meadow.

129
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,940
Then the real princess had time to brush her
hair.

130
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,350
All this made Kirsten angry.

131
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,839
'You're strange!'

132
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,110
she said to the princess.

133
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,931
'Who are you?

134
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:45,670
You talk to the wind!

135
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,290
You talk to a dead horse's head!

136
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,700
You're mad.

137
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,800
You're a mad girl.

138
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,050
I'm going to tell the king about you.'

139
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:07,110
So Kirsten went to the king and said, 'Listen!

140
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,860
That girl is mad.

141
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,410
I don't want to work with her again.

142
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,029
Every day she talks to a dead horse's head.

143
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,029
And it talks back to her.

144
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,430
And she sings to the wind.

145
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,860
She asks the wind to blow my hat off.

146
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,019
I have to run all over the meadow!'

147
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,920
'Mmm!' said the king.

148
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,029
T want to come and see this.'

149
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,399
So the next day the king hid and watched.

150
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,470
And he saw that it was true.

151
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,449
The king heard the real princess speak to
Falada's head.

152
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,439
'Falada!

153
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,310
My horse!

154
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,610
Do you know me?'

155
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,910
'Yes, Princess!

156
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,790
You are the true bride.'

157
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,450
And in the meadow the king heard her sing
to the wind.

158
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,730
'Blow, wind.

159
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,880
Blow!'

160
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,350
she sang.

161
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:46,100
'Blow Kirsten's hat, blow it over there, so
I have time to brush my hair!'

162
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,410
He saw Kirsten's hat blow off.

163
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,779
And he saw her run all over the meadow.

164
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:03,879
That evening the king said, 'Who are you?

165
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,279
I watched you today.

166
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,069
I saw some very strange things.

167
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:16,220
What is your story?'

168
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:25,260
'Oh!' answered the princess, 'I cannot tell
you my story.

169
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,379
She will kill me if I tell you anything.'

170
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,970
The king thought.

171
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:42,139
Then he said, 'I see - you are too afraid
to tell me.

172
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,970
You can't tell me.

173
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,379
All right.

174
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,430
I will go out of the room.

175
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:57,699
And you can tell your story to this old cupboard.'

176
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:01,800
The princess needed to speak.

177
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,060
So she got inside the old cupboard.

178
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,440
It was dark, but it was warm.

179
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,220
And in the dark, she told her story.

180
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,850
The king listened through a hole in the wall.

181
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,779
He heard all she said.

182
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:31,499
'I am the real princess - the true bride.

183
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:37,399
My maid is going to marry the prince.

184
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,480
She took my dress.

185
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,930
She took my horse, Falada.

186
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,540
She rode it here.

187
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,809
She made me ride behind her.

188
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,920
I have no one to help me.

189
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,699
She will kill me if I tell anyone.'

190
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:08,720
Then the king said, 'Do not be afraid!

191
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,050
Come with me.

192
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,670
It is time to make everything right.'

193
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:23,399
The king found the prince and all the people
in the castle.

194
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,279
'Now,' he said.

195
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,050
'Listen carefully and do not say a word.'

196
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,230
Then he told them about the real princess.

197
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,839
And they were happy.

198
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,890
They could see that she was beautiful and
good.

199
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:53,399
That night the true bride sat next to the
prince.

200
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,980
Her maid sat on his other side and did not
know her.

201
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,999
After dinner, the king spoke to everybody.

202
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,610
'Listen!' said the king.

203
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,040
'I have a story to tell you all.'

204
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,490
'Once there was a princess who had a maid.

205
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,579
That princess had to ride far away to marry
a prince.

206
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,559
And the maid went with her.

207
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,160
But on the way the maid said, "Give me your
dress!

208
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,420
And give me your horse!

209
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,249
Or I will kill you!

210
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:53,269
I am going to be the princess now - and I
am going to marry the prince!"'

211
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:06,169
Then the king went up to the maid and said,
'Tell me what you think about this.'

212
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:11,490
And she answered, That's really bad!

213
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,970
Put that bad maid on a horse - a mad, bad
horse.

214
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:25,770
And let the mad, bad horse throw her into
the sea!'

215
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:36,520
'Right,' said the king, 'then this is what
will happen to you!'

216
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,260
So the maid had to ride a mad, bad horse.

217
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,710
And it threw her into the sea.

218
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:54,370
Then the prince married the real princess
- the true bride.

219
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,660
And they were very happy.
