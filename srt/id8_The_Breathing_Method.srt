00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,279
CHAPTER ONE
The Club

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,760
I dressed a bit more speedily than normal
on that snowy, windy, bitter night-I admit

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,821
it. It was 23 December, 1970, and I suspect
that there were other members of the club

4
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:23,350
who did the same. Taxis are notoriously hard
to come by in New York on stormy nights, so

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,960
I called for a radio-cab. I did this at five-thirty
for an eight o'clock pick-up-my wife raised

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,350
an eyebrow but said nothing. I was under the
awning of the apartment building on East 58th

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,460
Street, where Ellen and I had lived since
1946, by quarter to eight, and when the taxi

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,010
was five minutes late, I found myself pacing
up and down impatiently.

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,740
The taxi arrived at 8.10 and I got in, too
glad to be out of the wind to be as angry

10
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,110
with the driver as he probably deserved. That
wind, part of a cold front that had swept

11
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,540
down from Canada the day before, meant business.
It whistled and whined around the cab's window,

12
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,640
occasionally drowning out the salsa on the
driver's radio and rocking the big Checker

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,080
on its springs. Many of the stores were open
but the sidewalks were nearly bare of last-minute

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,890
shoppers. Those that were abroad looked uncomfortable
or actually pained.

15
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,800
It had been flurrying off and on all day,
and now the snow began again, coming first

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,990
in thin membranes, then twisting into cyclone
shapes ahead of us in the street. Coming home

17
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,110
that night, I would think of the combination
of snow, a taxi, and New York City with considerably

18
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:43,140
greater unease but I did not of course know
that then.

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,820
At the corner of 3rd and Fortieth, a large
tinsel Christmas bell went floating through

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,180
the intersection like a spirit. 'Bad night,'
the cabbie said. "They'll have an extra two

21
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,040
dozen in the morgue tomorrow. Wino Popsicles.
Plus a few bag-lady Popsicles.'

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,890
'I suppose.'

23
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,399
The cabbie ruminated. 'Well, good riddance,'
he said finally. 'Less welfare, right?'

24
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,180
'Your Christmas spirit,' I said, 'is stunning
in its width and depth.'

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,370
The cabbie ruminated. 'You one of those bleeding-heart
liberals?' he asked finally.

26
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,450
'I refuse to answer on the grounds that my
answer might tend to incriminate me,' I said.

27
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,810
The cabbie gave a why-do-I-always-get-the-wisenheimers
snort but he shut up.

28
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,830
He let me out at 2nd and Thirty-Fifth, and
I walked halfway down the block to the club,

29
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,680
bent over against the whistling wind, holding
my hat on my head with one gloved hand.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,330
In almost no time at all the life-force seemed
to have been driven deep into my body, a flickering

31
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,410
blue flame about the size of the pilot-light
in a gas oven. At seventy-three, a man feels

32
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,569
the cold quicker and deeper. That man should
be home in front of a fireplace or at least

33
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,760
in front of an electric heater. At seventy-three,
hot blood isn't even really a memory; it's

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,030
more of an academic concept.

35
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,180
The latest flurry was letting up, but snow
as dry as sand still beat into my face. I

36
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,110
was glad to see that the steps leading up
to the door of 249 had been sanded-that was

37
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,340
Stevens's work, of course-Stevens knew the
base alchemy of old age well enough: not lead

38
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,280
into gold but bones into glass. When I think
about such things, I believe that God probably

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,030
thinks a great deal like Groucho Marx.

40
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,739
Then Stevens was there, holding the door open,
and a moment later I was inside. Down the

41
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,170
mahogany-panelled hallway, through double
doors standing three-quarters of the way open

42
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,230
on their recessed tracks, into the library
cum reading-room cum bar. It was a dark room

43
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,530
in which occasional pools of light gleamed-reading-lamps.
A richer, more textured light glowed across

44
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,450
the oak parquet floor, and I could hear the
steady snap of birch logs in the huge fireplace.

45
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,491
The heat radiated all the way across the room
-surely there is no welcome for a man or a

46
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:17,609
woman that can equal a fire on the hearth.
A paper rustled-dry, slightly impatient. That

47
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,590
would be Johanssen, with his Wall Street Journal.
After ten years, it was possible to recognize

48
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:33,080
his presence simply by the way he read his
stocks. Amusing and in a quiet way, amazing.

49
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,790
Stevens helped me off with my overcoat, murmuring
that it was a dirty night; WCBS was now forecasting

50
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,729
heavy snow before morning.

51
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,650
I agreed that it was indeed a dirty night
and looked back into that big, high-ceilinged

52
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:56,999
room again. A dirty night, a roaring fire
and a ghost story. Did I say that at seventy-three

53
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:03,559
hot blood is a thing of the past? Perhaps
so. But I felt something warm in my chest

54
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:08,150
at the thought something that hadn't been
caused by the fire of Stevens's reliable,

55
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,509
dignified welcome.

56
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:15,449
I think it was because it was McCarron's turn
to tell the tale.

57
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,999
I had been coming to the brownstone which
stands at 249 East 35th Street for ten years

58
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:27,759
-coming at intervals that were almost-but
not quite-regular. In my own mind I think

59
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,020
of it is a 'gentleman's club', that amusing
pre-Gloria Steinem antiquity. But even now

60
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,120
I am not sure that's what it really is, or
how it came to be in the first place. On the

61
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,180
night Emlyn McCarron told his story-the story
of the Breathing Method-there were perhaps

62
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,409
thirteen clubmembers in all, although only
six of us had come out on that howling, bitter

63
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:55,909
night. I can remember years when there might
have been as few as eight full-time members,

64
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:01,379
and others when there were at least twenty,
and perhaps more. I suppose Stevens might

65
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,259
know how it all came to be-one thing I am
sure of is that Stevens has been there from

66
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,250
the first, no matter how long that may be
and I believe Stevens to be older than he

67
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:18,430
looks. Much, much older. He has a faint Brooklyn
accent, but in spite of that he is as brutally

68
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,469
correct and as cuttingly punctilious as a
third-generation English butler. His reserve

69
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:30,589
is part of his often maddening charm, and
Stevens's small smile is a locked and latched

70
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,839
door. I have never seen any club records-if
he keeps them. I have never gotten a receipt

71
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,969
of dues-there are no dues. I have never been
called by the club secretary-there is no secretary,

72
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:49,039
and at 249 East 35 th, there are no phones.
There is no box of white marbles and black

73
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,270
balls. And the club-if it is a club-has never
had a name.

74
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:03,210
I first came to the club (as I must continue
to call it) as the guest of George Waterhouse.

75
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,210
Waterhouse headed the law firm for which I
had worked since 1951. My progress upward

76
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,050
in the firm-one of New York's three biggest-had
been steady but extremely slow; I was a slogger,

77
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,069
a mule for work, something of a centre puncher
but I had no real flair or genius. I had seen

78
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,490
men who had begun at the same time I had,
promoted in giant steps while I only continued

79
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:36,589
to pace -and I saw it with no real surprise.
Waterhouse and I had exchanged pleasantries,

80
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:41,599
attended the obligatory dinner put on by the
firm each October, and had little more congress

81
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,249
until the fall of 1960, when he dropped by
my office one day in early November.

82
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:54,520
This in itself was unusual enough, and it
had me thinking black thoughts (dismissal)

83
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,360
that were counterbalanced by giddy ones (an
unexpected promotion). It was a puzzling visit.

84
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,709
Waterhouse leaned in the doorway, his Phi
Beta Kappa key gleaming mellowly on his vest,

85
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:12,419
and talked in amiable generalities-none of
what he said seemed to have any real substance

86
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,279
or importance. I kept expecting him to finish
the pleasantries and get down to cases: 'Now

87
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,409
about this Casey brief,' or 'We've been asked
to research the Mayor's appointment of Salkowitz

88
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:29,419
to -' But it seemed there were no cases. He
glanced at his watch, said he had enjoyed

89
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:34,800
our talk and that he had to be going. I was
still blinking, bewildered, when he turned

90
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,789
back and said casually: There's a place where
I go most Thursday nights-a sort of club.

91
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,900
Old duffers, mostly, but some of them are
good company. They keep a really excellent

92
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,340
cellar, if you've a palate. Every now and
then someone tells a good story, as well.

93
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,320
Why not come down some night, David? As my
guest.'

94
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,180
I stammered some reply-even now I'm not sure
what it was. I was bewildered by the offer.

95
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,520
It had a spur-of-the-moment sound, but there
was nothing spur-of-the-moment about his eyes,

96
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,120
blue Anglo-Saxon ice under the bushy white
whorls of his eyebrows. And if I don't remember

97
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,900
exactly how I replied, it was because I felt
suddenly sure that this offer -vague and puzzling

98
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:24,440
as it was-had been exactly the specific I
had kept expecting him to get down to.

99
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,810
Ellen's reaction that evening was one of amused
exasperation. I had been with Waterhouse,

100
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,050
Garden, Lawton, Frasier, and Effingham for
something like twenty years, and it was clear

101
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,620
enough that I could not expect to rise much
above the mid-level position I now held; it

102
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,720
was her idea that this was the firm's cost-efficient
substitute for a gold watch.

103
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,391
'Old men telling war stories and playing poker,'
she said. 'A night of that and you're supposed

104
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:55,020
to be happy in the Research Library until
they pension you off, I suppose oh, I put

105
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,210
two Becks' on ice for you.' And she kissed
me warmly. I suppose she had seen something

106
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:06,080
on my face-God knows she's good at reading
me after all the years we've spent together.

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,380
Nothing happened over a course of weeks. When
my mind turned to Waterhouse's odd offer-certainly

108
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,710
odd coming from a man with whom I met less
than a dozen times a year, and who I only

109
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,510
saw socially at perhaps three parties a year,
including the company party in October- I

110
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,580
supposed that I had been mistaken about the
expression in his eyes, that he really had

111
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,360
made the offer casually, and had forgotten
it. Or regretted it-ouch! And then he approached

112
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,690
me one late afternoon, a man of nearly seventy
who was still broad-shouldered and athletic

113
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,030
looking. I was shrugging on my topcoat with
my briefcase between my feet. He said: 'If

114
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,030
you'd still like to have a drink at the club,
why not come tonight?' 'Well, I...'

115
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:55,190
'Good.' He slapped a slip of paper into my
hand. 'Here's the address.' He was waiting

116
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,510
for me at the foot of the steps that evening,
and Stevens held the door for us. The wine

117
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,820
was as excellent as Waterhouse had promised.
He made no attempt whatsoever to 'introduce

118
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,080
me around'- I took that for snobbery but later
recanted the idea -but two or three of them

119
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,630
introduced themselves to me. One of those
who did so was Emlyn McCarron, even then in

120
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:24,330
his early seventies. He held out his hand
and I clasped it briefly. His skin was dry,

121
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,920
leathery, tough; almost turtle-like. He asked
me if I played bridge. I said I did not.

122
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,690
'God damned good thing,' he said 'That god
damned game has done more in this century

123
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,860
to kill intelligent after-dinner conversation
than anything else I can think of.' And with

124
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,310
that pronouncement he walked away into the
murk of the library, where shelves of books

125
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,350
went up apparently to infinity.

126
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,670
I looked around for Waterhouse, but he had
disappeared. Feeling a little uncomfortable

127
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,090
and a lot out of place, I wandered over to
the fireplace. It was, as I believe I have

128
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,960
already mentioned, a huge thing-it seemed
particularly huge in New York, where apartment-dwellers

129
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,950
such as myself have trouble imagining such
a benevolence big enough to do anything more

130
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:16,340
than pop corn or toast bread. The fireplace
at 249 East 35th was big enough to broil an

131
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:24,350
ox whole. There was no mantle; instead a brawny
stone arch curved over it This arch was broken

132
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,620
in the centre by a keystone which jutted out
slightly. It was just on the level of my eyes,

133
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,180
and although the light was dim, I could read
the legend engraved on that stone with no

134
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:43,000
trouble: IT IS THE TALE, NOT HE WHO TELLS
IT. 'Here you go, David,' Waterhouse said

135
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,670
from my elbow, and I jumped. He hadn't deserted
me after all; had only trudged off into some

136
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,930
uncharted locale to bring back drinks. 'Bombay
martini's yours, isn't it?'

137
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,050
'Yes. Thank you. Mr Waterhouse -'

138
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,450
'George,' he said. 'Here it's just George.'

139
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:04,780
'George, then,' I said, although it seemed
slightly mad to be using his first name. 'What

140
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,360
is all of-'

141
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,420
'Cheers,' he said.

142
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,161
We drank. The martini was perfect. I said
so instead of finishing my question. 'Stevens

143
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:16,130
tends the bar. He makes fine drinks. He likes
to say it's a small but vital skill. ' The

144
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:22,310
martini took the edge off my feelings of disorientation
and awkwardness (the edge, but the feelings

145
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,600
themselves remained- I had spent nearly half
an hour gazing into my closet and wondering

146
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,360
what to wear; I had finally settled on dark
brown slacks and a rough tweed jacket that

147
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,380
almost matched them, hoping I would not be
wandering into a group of men either turned

148
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,640
out in tuxedos or wearing bluejeans and L.
L. Bean's lumberjack shirts it seemed that

149
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,300
I hadn't gone too far wrong on the matter
of dress, anyway). A new place and a new situation

150
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:55,120
makes one crucially aware of every social
act, no matter how small, and at that moment,

151
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,120
drink in hand and the obligatory small toast
made, I wanted very much to be sure that I

152
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,240
hadn't overlooked any of the amenities. 'Is
there a guest book I ought to sign?' I asked.

153
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,050
'Something like that?' He looked mildly surprised.
'We don't have anything like that,' he said.

154
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,150
'At least, I don't think we do.' He glanced
around the dim, quiet room. Johanssen rattled

155
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,730
his Wall Street Journal, I saw Stevens pass
in a doorway at the far end of the room, ghostly

156
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,750
in his white mess jacket. George put his drink
on an endtable and tossed a fresh log onto

157
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,470
the fire. Sparks corkscrewed up the black
throat of the chimney.

158
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,070
'What does that mean?' I asked, pointing to
the inscription on the keystone. 'Any idea?'

159
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,430
Waterhouse read it carefully, as if for the
first time. IT IS THE TALE, NOT HE WHO TELLS

160
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,430
IT.

161
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,150
'I suppose I have an idea,' he said. 'You
may, too, if you should come back. Yes, I

162
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:54,770
should say you may have an idea or two. In
time. Enjoy yourself, David.' He walked away.

163
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,840
And, although it may seem odd, having been
left to sink or swim in such an unfamiliar

164
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:08,040
situation, I did enjoy myself. For one thing,
I have always loved books, and there was a

165
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,910
trove of interesting ones to examine here.
I walked slowly along the shelves, examining

166
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,270
the spines as best I could in the faint light,
pulling one out now and then, and pausing

167
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,400
once to look out a narrow window at the 2nd
Avenue intersection up the street. I stood

168
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,740
there and watched through the frost-rimmed
glass as the traffic light at the intersection

169
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,990
cycled from red to green to amber and back
to red again, and quite suddenly I felt the

170
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:45,560
queerest-and yet very welcome -sense of peace
come to me. It did not flood in; instead it

171
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,660
seemed to almost steal in. Oh yes, I can hear
you saying, that makes great sense; watching

172
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,720
a stop-and-go light gives everyone a sense
of peace. All right; it made no sense. I grant

173
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,240
you that. But the feeling was there, just
the same. It made me think for the first time

174
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,980
in years of the winter nights in the Wisconsin
farmhouse where I grew up: lying in bed in

175
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:16,230
a draughty upstairs room and marking the contrast
between the whistle of the January wind outside,

176
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,550
drifting snow as dry as sand along miles of
snow-fence, and the warmth my body created

177
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:28,790
under the two quilts. There were some law
books, but they were pretty damn strange:

178
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:36,000
Twenty Cases of Dismemberment and Their Outcomes
under British Law is one title I remember.

179
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,740
Pet Cases was another. I opened that one and
sure enough, it was a scholarly legal tome

180
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,860
dealing with the law's treatment (American
law, this time) of cases which bore in some

181
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,080
important respect upon pets-everything from
housecats that had inherited great sums of

182
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,720
money to an ocelot that had broken its chain
and seriously injured a postman. There was

183
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,069
a set of Dickens, a set of Defoe, a nearly
endless set of Trollope; and there was also

184
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,929
a set of novels-eleven of them-by a man named
Edward Gray Seville. They were bound in handsome

185
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:20,069
green leather, and the name of the firm gold-stamped
on the spine was Stedham & Son. I had never

186
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,809
heard of Seville nor of his publishers. The
copyright date of the first Seville-These

187
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:32,649
Were Our Brothers-was 1911. The date of the
last, Breakers, was 1935.

188
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:40,309
Two shelves down from the set of Seville novels
was a large folio volume which contained careful

189
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:47,539
step by step plans for Erector Set enthusiasts.
Next to it was another folio volume which

190
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:53,309
featured famous scenes from famous movies.
Each of these pictures filled one whole page,

191
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:58,330
and opposite each, filling the facing pages,
were free-verse poems either about the scenes

192
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,409
with which they were paired or inspired by
them. Not a very remarkable concept, but the

193
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:11,419
poets who were represented were remarkable-Robert
Frost, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams,

194
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:17,980
Wallace Stevens, Louis Zukofsky, and Erica
Jong, to mention just a few. Halfway through

195
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,240
the book I found a poem by Archibald MacLeish
set next to that famous photograph of Marilyn

196
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,340
Monroe standing on the subway grating and
trying to hold her skirt down. The poem was

197
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:37,149
titled The Toll' and it began: The shape of
the skirt is -we would say-the shape of a

198
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:45,940
bell The legs are the clapper-And some such
more. Not a terrible poem, but certainly not

199
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,279
MacLeish's best or anywhere near the top drawer.
I felt I could hold such an opinion because

200
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,929
I had read a good deal of Archibald MacLeish
over the years. I could not, however, recall

201
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,649
this poem about Marilyn Monroe (which it is;
the poem announces it even when divorced from

202
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:09,830
the picture-at the end MacLeish writes: My
legs clap my name: (Marilyn, ma belle). I

203
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,100
have looked for it since then and haven't
been able to find it; which means nothing,

204
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:20,169
of course. Poems are not like novels or legal
opinions; they are more like blown leaves

205
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:26,861
and any omnibus volume titled The Complete
So-and-So must certainly be a lie. Poems have

206
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:32,650
a way of getting lost under sofas-it is one
of their charms, and one of the reasons they

207
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,700
endure. But...

208
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,160
At some point Stevens came by with a second
martini (by then I had settled into a chair

209
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,240
of my own with a volume of Ezra Pound). It
was as perfect as the first. As I sipped it

210
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,510
I saw two of those present, George Gregson
and Harry Stein (Harry was six years dead

211
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,809
on the night Emlyn McCarron told us the story
of the Breathing Method), leave the room by

212
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:07,929
a peculiar door less than three feet high.
It was an Alice Down the Rabbit-Hole door

213
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:13,270
if ever there was one. They left it open,
and shortly after their odd exit from the

214
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,869
library I heard the muted click of billiard
balls.

215
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:22,629
Stevens passed by and asked if I would like
another martini. I declined with real regret.

216
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:27,230
He nodded. 'Very good sir.' His face never
changed, and yet I had an obscure feeling

217
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,139
that I had somehow pleased him.

218
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,590
Laughter startled me from my book sometime
later. Someone had thrown a packet of chemical

219
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:42,679
powder into the fire and turned the flames
momentarily particoloured. I thought of my

220
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,679
boyhood again but not in any wistful, sloppily
romantic-nostalgic way. I feel a great need

221
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,649
to emphasize that, God knows why. I thought
of times when I had done just such a thing

222
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:02,440
as a kid, but the memory was a strong one,
pleasant, untinged with regret.

223
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,059
I saw that most of the others had drawn chairs
up around the hearth in a semicircle. Stevens

224
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:13,830
had produced a heaping, smoking platter of
marvellous hot sausages. Harry Stein returned

225
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:19,970
through the down-the-rabbit-hole door, introducing
himself hurriedly but pleasantly to me. Gregson

226
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,200
remained in the billiard room, practising
shots, by the sound. After a moment's hesitation

227
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,769
I joined the others. A story was told-not
a pleasant one. It was Norman Stett who told

228
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,780
it, and while it is not my purpose to recount
it here, perhaps you'll understand what I

229
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,070
mean about its quality if I tell you that
it was about a man who drowned in a telephone

230
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,990
booth.

231
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:50,630
When Stett-who is also dead now-finished,
someone said, 'You should have saved it for

232
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,650
Christmas, Norman.' There was laughter, which
I of course did not understand. At least,

233
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,289
not then.

234
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:05,620
Waterhouse himself spoke up then, and such
a Waterhouse I never would have dreamed of

235
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,809
in a thousand years of dreaming. A graduate
of Yale, a Phi Beta Kappa, silver-haired,

236
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:19,179
three-piece-suited head of a law firm so large
it was more enterprise than company - this

237
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:25,879
Waterhouse told a story that had to do with
a teacher who had gotten stuck in a privy.

238
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:31,850
The privy stood behind the one-room schoolhouse
in which she had taught, and the day she got

239
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,739
her caboose jammed into one of the privy's
two holes also happened to be the day the

240
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:43,639
privy was scheduled to be taken away as Anniston
County's contribution to the Life As It Was

241
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:50,710
in New England exhibition being held at the
Prudential Center in Boston. The teacher hadn't

242
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,009
made a sound during all the time it took to
load the privy onto the back of a flatbed

243
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:02,509
truck and to spike it down; she was struck
dumb with embarrassment and horror, Waterhouse

244
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:08,929
said. And then the privy door blew off into
the passing lane of Route 128 in Somerville

245
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:16,330
during rush hour-But draw a curtain over that,
and over any other stories which might have

246
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,539
followed it; they are not my stories tonight.
At some point Stevens produced a bottle of

247
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:27,519
brandy that was more than just good; it was
damned near exquisite. It was passed around

248
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:36,080
and Johanssen raised a toast-the toast, one
might almost say: The tale, not he who tells

249
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,519
it. We drank to that.

250
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,600
Not long after, men began slipping away. It
wasn't late; not yet midnight, anyway; but

251
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,649
I've noticed that when your fifties give way
to your sixties, late begins coming earlier

252
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:58,019
and earlier. I saw Waterhouse slipping his
arms into the overcoat Stevens was holding

253
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,700
open for him, and decided that must be my
cue. I thought it strange that Waterhouse

254
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,659
would slip away without so much as a word
to me (which certainly seemed to be what he

255
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,889
was doing; if I had come back from shelving
the Pound book forty seconds later, he would

256
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:18,039
have been gone), but no stranger than most
of the other things that had gone on that

257
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,269
evening.

258
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:25,109
I stepped out just behind him, and Waterhouse
glanced around, as if surprised to see me

259
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:30,450
and almost as if he had been startled out
of a light doze. 'Share a taxi?' he asked,

260
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,820
as though we had just met by chance on this
deserted, windy street 'Thank you,' I said.

261
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,580
I meant thanks for a great deal more than
his offer to share a cab, and I believe that

262
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,019
was unmistakable in my tone, but he nodded
as if that was all I had meant.

263
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:52,420
A taxi with its for-hire light lit was cruising
slowly down the street-fellows like George

264
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,679
Waterhouse seem to luck onto cabs even on
those miserably cold or snowy New York nights

265
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,759
when you would swear there isn't a cab to
be had on the entire island of Manhattan-and

266
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,230
he flagged it.

267
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:11,179
Inside, safely warm, the taxi-meter charting
our journey in measured clicks, I told him

268
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:17,739
how much I had enjoyed his story. I couldn't
remember laughing so hard or so spontaneously

269
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:23,369
since I was eighteen, I told him, which was
not flattery but only the simple truth.

270
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:31,840
'Oh? How kind of you to say.' His voice was
chillingly polite. I subsided, feeling a dull

271
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,169
flush in my cheeks. One does not always need
to hear a slam to know that the door has been

272
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,519
closed.

273
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,249
When the taxi drew up to the curb in front
of my building, I thanked him again, and this

274
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:49,799
time he showed a trifle more warmth. 'It was
good of you to come on such short notice,'

275
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,940
he said. 'Come again, if you like. Don't wait
for an invitation: we don't stand much on

276
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,049
ceremony at two-four-nine. Thursdays are best
for stories, but the club is there every night.'

277
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,529
Am I then to assume membership?

278
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:10,289
The question was on my lips. I meant to ask
it; it seemed necessary to ask it. I was only

279
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,760
mulling it over, listening to it in my head
(in my tiresome lawyer's way) to hear if I

280
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,130
had got the phrasing right-perhaps that was
a little too blunt-when Waterhouse told the

281
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:26,850
cabbie to drive on. The next moment the taxi
was rolling on towards Madison. I stood there

282
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,830
on the sidewalk for a moment, the hem of my
topcoat whipping around my shins, thinking:

283
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,110
He knew I was going to ask that question-he
knew it, and he purposely had the driver go

284
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:41,409
on before I could. Then I told myself that
was utterly absurd -paranoid, even.

285
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:49,590
And it was. But it was also true. I could
scoff all I liked; none of the scoffing changed

286
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,749
that essential certainty.

287
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,019
I walked slowly to the door of my building
and went inside.

288
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,470
Ellen was sixty per cent asleep when I sat
down on the bed to take off my shoes. She

289
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,929
rolled over and made a fuzzy interrogative
sound deep in her throat. I told her to go

290
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,179
back to sleep.

291
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:13,210
She made the fuzzy sound again. This time
approximated English: 'Howwuzzit?'

292
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,020
For a moment I hesitated, my shirt half-unbuttoned.
And I thought with one moment's utter clarity:

293
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,100
If I tell her, I will never see the other
side of that door again.

294
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,580
'It was all right,' I said. 'Old men telling
war stories.'

295
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,149
'I told you so.'

296
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:34,590
'But it wasn't bad. I might go back again.
It might do me some good with the firm.'

297
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:41,289
'"The firm",' she mocked lightly. 'What an
old buzzard you are, my love.'

298
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:47,360
'It takes one to know one,' I said, but she
had already fallen asleep again. I undressed,

299
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,060
showered, towelled, put on my pyjamas and
then, instead of going to bed as I should

300
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,139
have done (it was edging past one by that
time), I put on my robe and had another bottle

301
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:02,679
of Beck's. I sat at the kitchen table, drinking
it slowly, looking out the window and up the

302
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:09,059
cold canyon of Madison Avenue, thinking. My
head was a trifle buzzy from my evening's

303
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:16,489
intake of alcohol-for me an unexpectedly large
intake. But the feeling was not at all unpleasant,

304
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:20,160
and I had no sense of an impending hangover.

305
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,429
The thought which had come to me when Ellen
asked me about my evening was as ridiculous

306
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:32,229
as the one I'd entertained about George Waterhouse
as the cab drew away from me -what in God's

307
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:37,859
name could be wrong with telling my wife about
a perfectly harmless evening at my boss's

308
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:43,609
stuffy men's club and even if something were
wrong with telling her, who would know that

309
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:52,979
I had? No, it was every bit as ridiculous
and paranoid as those earlier musings and,

310
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:59,630
my heart told me, every bit as true.

311
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,549
I met George Waterhouse the next day in the
hallway between Accounts and the Reading Library.

312
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:10,649
Met him Passed him would be more accurate.
He nodded my way and went on without speaking

313
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,609
as he had done for years.

314
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:20,409
My stomach muscles ached all day long. That
was the only thing that completely convinced

315
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:23,789
me the evening had been real.

316
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:31,359
Three weeks passed. Four five. No second invitation
came from Waterhouse.

317
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:38,460
Somehow I just hadn't been right; hadn't fitted.
Or so I told myself. It was a depressing,

318
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,429
disappointing thought. I supposed it would
begin to fade and lose its sting, as all disappointments

319
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:49,600
eventually do. But I thought of that evening
at the oddest moments-the isolated pools of

320
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,519
library lamplight, so still and tranquil and
somehow civilized; Waterhouse's absurd and

321
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,999
hilarious tale of the schoolteacher stuck
in the privy; the rich smell of leather in

322
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:08,999
the narrow stacks. Most of all I thought of
standing by that narrow window and watching

323
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:16,489
the frost crystals change from green to amber
to red. I thought of that sense of peace I

324
00:30:16,489 --> 00:30:18,539
had felt.

325
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:24,149
During that same five-week period I went to
the library and checked out four volumes of

326
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:29,299
Archibald MacLeish's poetry (I had three others
myself, and had already checked through them);

327
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:35,299
one of these volumes purported to be The Complete
Poems of. I reacquainted myself with some

328
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,460
old favourites, including my favourite MacLeish
poem, 'Epistle to Be Left in Earth.' But I

329
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,840
found no poem called 'The Toll' in any of
the volumes.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,820
On that same trip to the New York Public Library,
I checked the card catalogue for works of

331
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:54,320
fiction by a man named Edward Gray Seville.
A mystery novel by a woman named Ruth Seville

332
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,299
was the closest I came.

333
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:03,429
Come again, if you like; don't wait for an
invitation

334
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,399
I was waiting for an invitation anyway, of
course; my mother taught me donkey's years

335
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,340
ago not to automatically believe people who
tell you glibly to 'drop by anytime' or that

336
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,779
'the door is always open'. I didn't feel I
needed an engraved card delivered to my apartment

337
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:27,399
door by a footman in livery bearing a gilt
plate, I don't mean that, but I did want something,

338
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:33,289
even if it was only a casual remark: 'Coming
by some night, David? Hope we didn't bore

339
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,129
you.' That kind of thing.

340
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,989
But when even that didn't come, I began to
think more seriously about going back anyway-after

341
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:47,669
all, sometimes people really did want you
to drop in anytime; I supposed that, at some

342
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:53,769
places, the door always was open; and that
mothers weren't always right.

343
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,299
Don't wait for an invitation

344
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:02,379
Anyway, that's how it happened that, on 10
December of that year, I found myself putting

345
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:08,619
on my rough tweed coat and dark brown pants
again and looking for my darkish red tie.

346
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:13,260
I was rather more aware of my heartbeat than
usual that night, I remember.

347
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,129
'George Waterhouse finally broke down and
asked you back?' Ellen asked. 'Back into the

348
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:21,489
sty with the rest of the male chauvinist oinkers?'

349
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:28,299
'That's right,' I said, thinking it must be
the first time in at least a dozen years that

350
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:33,619
I had told her a lie and then I remembered
that, after the first meeting, I had answered

351
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:39,349
her questions about what it had been like
with a lie. Old men telling war stories, I

352
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:40,349
had said.

353
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:44,779
'Well, maybe there really will be a promotion
in it,' she said though without much hope.

354
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:49,289
To her credit, she said it without much bitterness,
either.

355
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,940
'Stranger things have happened,' I said, and
kissed her goodbye.

356
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,779
'Oink-oink,' she said as I went out the door.

357
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:03,149
The taxi ride that night seemed very long.
It was cold, still, and starry. The cab was

358
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:09,190
a Checker and I felt somehow very small in
it, like a child seeing the city for the first

359
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,440
time.

360
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,529
It was excitement I was feeling as the cab
pulled up in front of the brownstone-something

361
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:21,749
as simple and yet complete as that. But such
simple excitement seems to be one of life's

362
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:27,450
qualities that slips away almost unnoticed,
and its rediscovery as one grows older is

363
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,809
always something of a surprise, like finding
a black hair or two in one's comb years after

364
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:36,789
one had last found such a thing.

365
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:43,220
I paid the driver, got out, and walked towards
the four steps leading to the door. As I mounted

366
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:50,159
them, my excitement curdled into plain apprehension
(a feeling the old are much more familiar

367
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,200
with). What exactly was I doing here?

368
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,710
The door was of thick panelled oak, and to
my eye it looked as stout as the door of a

369
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,889
castle keep. There was no doorbell that I
could see, no knocker, no closed circuit TV

370
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:10,310
camera mounted unobtrusively hi the shadow
of a deep eave, and, of course, no Waterhouse

371
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,800
waiting to take me in. I stopped at the foot
of the steps and looked around.

372
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,770
Thirty-Fifth Street suddenly seemed darker,
colder, more threatening. The brownstones

373
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:27,860
all looked somehow secret, as if hiding mysteries
best not investigated. Their windows looked

374
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,830
like eyes.

375
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:36,980
Somewhere, behind one of those windows, there
may be a man or woman contemplating murder,

376
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,970
I thought. A shudder worked up my spine. Contemplating
it or doing it.

377
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,900
Then, suddenly, the door was open and Stevens
was there.

378
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:54,740
I felt an intense surge of relief. I am not
an overly imaginative man, I think-at least

379
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:00,940
not under ordinary circumstances-but this
last thought had had all the eerie clarity

380
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,860
of prophecy. I might have babbled aloud if
I hadn't glanced at Stevens's eyes first.

381
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:15,240
His eyes did not know me. His eyes did not
know me at all.

382
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,940
Then there was another instance of that eerie,
prophetic clarity; I saw the rest of my evening

383
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,150
in perfect detail. Three hours in a quiet
bar. Three martinis (perhaps four) to dull

384
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,740
the embarrassment of having been fool enough
to go where I wasn't wanted. The humiliation

385
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,820
my mother's advice had been intended to avoid-that
which comes with knowing one has overstepped.

386
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,670
I saw myself going home a little tipsy, but
not in a good way. I saw myself merely sitting

387
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:54,110
through the cab ride rather than experiencing
it through that childlike lens of excitement

388
00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:00,110
and anticipation. I heard myself saying to
Ellen, It wears thin after a while Waterhouse

389
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:05,480
told the same story about winning a consignment
of T-bone steaks for the 3rd Battalion in

390
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:13,430
a poker game and they play Hearts for a dollar
a point, can you believe it? go back? I suppose

391
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:19,730
I might, but I doubt it. And that would be
the end of it. Except, I suppose, for my own

392
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,490
humiliation.

393
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:30,460
I saw all of this in the nothing of Stevens's
eyes. Then the eyes warmed. He smiled slightly

394
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,960
and said: 'Mr Adley! Come in. I'll take your
coat.'

395
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,740
I mounted the steps and Stevens closed the
door firmly behind me. How different a door

396
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,910
can feel when you are on the warm side of
it! He took my coat and was gone with it.

397
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,320
I stood in the hall for a moment, looking
at my own reflection in the pier glass, a

398
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,960
man of sixty-three whose face was rapidly
becoming too gaunt to look middle-aged. And

399
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,040
yet the reflection pleased me. I slipped into
the library.

400
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,600
Johanssen was there, reading his Wall Street
Journal. In another island of light, Emlyn

401
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,910
McCarron sat over a chessboard opposite Peter
Andrews. McCarron was and is a cadaverous

402
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:22,450
man, possessed of a narrow, bladelike nose;
Andrews was huge, slope-shouldered, and choleric.

403
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,970
A vast ginger-coloured beard sprayed over
his vest.

404
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:32,340
Face to face over the inlaid board with its
carved pieces of ivory and ebony, they looked

405
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,570
like Indian totems: eagle and bear.

406
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:42,710
Waterhouse was there, frowning over that day's
Times. He glanced up, nodded at me without

407
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:49,410
surprise, and disappeared into the paper again.
Stevens brought me a Bombay martini, unasked.

408
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:56,940
I took it into the stacks and found that puzzling,
enticing set of green volumes again. I began

409
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,550
reading the works of Edward Gray Seville that
night. I started at the beginning, with These

410
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,710
Were Our Brothers. Since then I have read
them all, and believe them to be eleven of

411
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,720
the finest novels of our century.

412
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,600
Near the end of the evening there was a story
-just one -and Stevens brought brandy around.

413
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,430
When the tale was told, people began to rise,
preparing to leave. Stevens spoke from the

414
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:33,540
double doorway which communicated with the
hallway. His voice was low and pleasant, but

415
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,300
carrying: 'Who will bring us a tale for Christmas,
then?'

416
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,320
People stopped what they were doing and glanced
around. There was some low, goodnatured talk

417
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,310
and a burst of laughter.

418
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:51,260
Stevens, smiling but serious, clapped his
hands together twice, like a grammar school

419
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:57,870
teacher calling an unruly class to order.
'Come, gentlemen-who'll bring the tale?' Peter

420
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:03,470
Andrews, he of the sloped shoulders and gingery
beard, cleared his throat. 'I have something

421
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,980
I've been thinking about I don't know if it's
quite right; that is, if it's

422
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,360
'That will be fine,' Stevens interrupted,
and there was more laughter. Andrews had his

423
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:20,660
back slapped good naturedly. Cold draughts
swirled up the hallway as men slipped out.

424
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:27,170
Then Stevens was there, as if by benign magic,
holding my coat for me. 'Good evening, Mr

425
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,470
Adley. Always a pleasure.'

426
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:35,210
'Do you really meet on Christmas night?' I
asked, buttoning my coat I was a little disappointed

427
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,750
that I was going to miss Andrews's story,
but we had made firm plans to drive to Schenectady

428
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,430
and keep the holiday with Ellen's sister.

429
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:51,060
Stevens managed to look both shocked and amused
at the same time. 'In no case,' he said. 'Christmas

430
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,840
is a night a man should spend with his family.
That night, if no other. Don't you agree,

431
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
sir?'

432
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
'I certainly do.'

433
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,480
'We always meet on the Thursday before Christmas.
In fact, that is the one night of the year

434
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,420
when we're assured a large turnout.'

435
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:16,950
He hadn't used the word members, I noticed-just
happenstance or neat avoidance? 'Many tales

436
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,970
have been spun out in the main room, Mr Adley,
tales of every sort, from the comic to the

437
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:28,840
tragic to the ironic to the sentimental. But
on the Thursday before Christmas, it's always

438
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,830
a tale of the uncanny. It's always been that
way, at least as far back as I can remember.'

439
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,760
That at least explained the comment I had
heard on my first visit, the one to the effect

440
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,110
that Norman Stett should have saved his story
for Christmas. Other questions hovered on

441
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,500
my lips, but I saw a reflected caution in
Stevens's eyes. Do you catch my drift? It

442
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,610
was not a warning that he would not answer
my questions; it was, rather, a warning that

443
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,920
I should not even ask them.

444
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,130
'Was there something else, Mr Adley?'

445
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:10,650
We were alone in the hall now. All the others
had left And suddenly the hallway seemed darker,

446
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:17,800
Stevens's long face paler, his lips redder.
A knot exploded in the fireplace and a red

447
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,430
glow washed momentarily across the polished
parquet floor. I thought I heard, from somewhere

448
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:33,430
in those as-yet-unexplored rooms beyond, a
kind of slithery bump. I did not like the

449
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,350
sound. Not at all.

450
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:42,820
'No,' I said in a voice that was not quite
steady. 'I think not.'

451
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:49,320
'Goodnight, then,' Stevens said, and I crossed
the threshold. I heard the heavy door close

452
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:56,170
behind me. I heard the lock turn. And then
I was walking towards the lights of 2nd Avenue,

453
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,720
not looking back over my shoulder, somehow
afraid to look back, as if I might see some

454
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:09,080
frightful fiend matching me stride for stride,
or glimpse some secret better kept than known.

455
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,640
I reached the corner, saw an empty cab, and
flagged it.

456
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:23,320
'More war stories?' Ellen asked me that night
She was in bed with Philip Marlowe, the only

457
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,950
lover she has ever taken. [Note: Phillip Marlowe
is a fictitious detective in novels]

458
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,400
"There was a war story or two,' I said, hanging
up my overcoat. 'Mostly I sat and read a book.'

459
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,000
'When you weren't oinking.'

460
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,380
'Yes, that's right. When I wasn't oinking.'

461
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:43,530
'Listen to this: "The first time I ever laid
eyes on Terry Lennox he was drunk in a Rolls-Royce

462
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,840
Stiver Wraith outside the terrace of the Dancers,"'
Ellen read.' "He had a young-looking face

463
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,070
but his hair was bone white. You could tell
by his eyes that he was plastered to the hairline,

464
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,770
but otherwise he looked like any other nice
young guy in a dinner jacket who had been

465
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,620
spending too much money in a place that exists
for that purpose and for no other." Nice,

466
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
huh? It's -'

467
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:10,490
'The Long Goodbye' I said, taking off my shoes.
'You read me that same passage once every

468
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,510
three years. It's part of your life-cycle.'

469
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,150
She wrinkled her nose at me. 'Oink-oink.'

470
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,510
'Thank you,' I said.

471
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,830
She went back to her book. I went out into
the kitchen to get a bottle of Beck's. When

472
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,970
I came back, she had laid The Long Goodbye
open on the counterpane and was looking at

473
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:33,020
me closely. 'David, are you going to join
this club?'

474
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:40,180
'I suppose I might if I'm asked.' I felt uncomfortable.
I had perhaps told her another lie. If there

475
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:50,100
was such a thing as membership at 249 East
35 th, I already was a member. 'I'm glad,'

476
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,620
she said. 'You've needed something for a long
time now. I don't think you even know it,

477
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,311
but you have. I've got the Relief Committee
and the Commission on Women's Rights and the

478
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:04,250
Theatre Society. But you've needed something.
Some people to grow old with, I think.'

479
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:10,220
I went to the bed and sat beside her and picked
up The Long Goodbye. It was a bright, new-minted

480
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,130
paperback. I could remember buying the original
hardback edition as a birthday present for

481
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:22,250
Ellen. In 1953. 'Are we old?' I asked her.

482
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:28,280
'I suspect we are,' she said, and smiled brilliantly
at me.

483
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,560
I put the book down and touched her breast.
'Too old for this?'

484
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:39,820
She turned the covers back with ladylike decorum
and then, giggling, kicked them onto the floor

485
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,000
with her feet. 'Beat me, daddy,' Ellen said,
'eight to the bar.'

486
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,120
'Oink, oink,' I said, and then we were both
laughing.

487
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,510
The Thursday before Christmas came. That evening
was much the same as the others, with two

488
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:59,560
notable exceptions. There were more people
there, perhaps as many as eighteen.

489
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,400
And there was a sharp, indefinable sense of
excitement in the air. Johansson took only

490
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,260
a cursory glance at his Journal and then joined
McCarron, Hugh Beagleman, and myself.

491
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,950
We sat near the windows, talking of this and
that, and finally fell into a passionate-and

492
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,470
often hilarious-discussion of pre-war automobiles.

493
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:27,500
There was, now that I think of it, a third
difference as well-Stevens had concocted a

494
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:34,151
delicious eggnog punch. It was smooth, but
it was also hot with rum and spices. It was

495
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:39,490
served from an incredible Waterford bowl that
looked like an ice-sculpture, and the animated

496
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:44,340
hum of the conversation grew ever higher as
the level of the punch grew lower.

497
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:49,740
I looked over in the corner by the tiny door
leading to the billiard room and was astounded

498
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:55,310
to see Waterhouse and Norman Stett flipping
baseball cards into what looked like a genuine

499
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,180
beaver tophat. They were laughing uproariously.

500
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:06,700
Groups formed and re-formed. The hour grew
late and then, at the time when people usually

501
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,800
began slipping out through the front door,
I saw Peter Andrews seated in front of the

502
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,580
fire with an unmarked packet, about the size
of a seed envelope, in one hand. He tossed

503
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,490
it into the flames without opening it, and
a moment later the fire began to dance with

504
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,960
every colour of the spectrum-and some, I would
have sworn, from outside it-before turning

505
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:34,560
yellow again. Chairs were dragged around.
Over Andrews's shoulder I could see the keystone

506
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,090
with its etched homily: IT IS THE TALE, NOT
HE WHO TELLS IT.

507
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:44,970
Stevens passed unobtrusively among us, taking
punch glasses and replacing them with snifters

508
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:50,580
of brandy. There were murmurs of 'Merry Christmas'
and 'Top of the season, Stevens,' and for

509
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,410
the first time I saw money change hands-a
ten dollar bill was unobtrusively tendered

510
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,610
here, a bill that looked like a fifty there,
one which I clearly saw was a hundred from

511
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,680
another chair.

512
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:09,580
'Thank you, Mr McCarron Mr Johansson Mr Beagleman'
A quiet, well-bred murmur.

513
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,880
I have lived in New York long enough to know
that the Christmas season is a carnival of

514
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,520
tips; something for the butcher, the baker,
the candlestick-maker-not to mention the doorman,

515
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,340
the super, and the cleaning lady who comes
in Tuesdays and Fridays. I've never met anyone

516
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:31,510
of my own class who regarded this as anything
but a necessary nuisance but I felt none of

517
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:37,860
that grudging spirit on that night. The money
was given willingly, even eagerly and suddenly,

518
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:44,520
for no reason (it was the way thoughts often
seemed to come when one was at 249), I thought

519
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:51,110
of the boy calling up to Scrooge on the still,
cold air of a London Christmas morning: 'Wot?

520
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:57,880
The goose that's as big as me?' And Scrooge,
nearly crazed with joy, giggling 'A good boy!

521
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,300
An excellent boy!'

522
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,770
I found my own wallet. In the back of this,
behind the pictures of Ellen I keep, there

523
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:10,850
has always been a fifty dollar bill which
I keep for emergencies. When Stevens gave

524
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:16,500
me my brandy, I slipped it into his hand with
never a qualm although I was not a rich man.

525
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,660
'Happy Christmas, Stevens,' I said.

526
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,250
'Thank you, sir. And the same to you.'

527
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:27,020
He finished passing out the brandies and collecting
his honorariums and retired. I glanced around

528
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:32,980
once, at the midpoint of Peter Andrews's story,
and saw him standing by the double doors,

529
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:38,680
a dim manlike shadow, still and silent.

530
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,710
'I'm a lawyer now, as most of you know,' Andrews
said after sipping at his glass, clearing

531
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:48,840
his throat, and then sipping again. 'I've
had offices on Park Avenue for the last twenty-two

532
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,730
years. But before that, I was a legal assistant
in a firm of lawyers which did business in

533
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:00,680
Washington, DC. One night in July I was required
to stay late in order to finish indexing case

534
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,310
citations in a brief which hasn't anything
at all to do with this story. But then a man

535
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:11,660
came in- a man who was at that time one of
the most widely known Senators on the Hill,

536
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:18,210
a man who later almost became President. His
shirt was matted with blood and his eyes were

537
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,070
bulging from their sockets.

538
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:25,280
'"I've got to talk to Joe," he said. Joe,
you understand, was Joseph Woods, the head

539
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,150
of my firm, one of the most influential private-sector
lawyers in Washington, and this Senator's

540
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,290
close personal friend.

541
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:37,690
'"He went home hours ago," I said. I was terribly
frightened, I can tell you-he looked like

542
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,080
a man who had just walked away from a dreadful
car accident, or perhaps from a knife-fight

543
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,180
And somehow seeing his face which I had seen
in newspaper photos and on Meet the Press-seeing

544
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:55,180
it streaked with gore, one cheek twitching
spasmodically below one wild eye all of that

545
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,470
made my fright worse. "I can call him if you
-" I was already fumbling with the phone,

546
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,141
mad with eagerness to turn this unexpected
responsibility over to someone else. Looking

547
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:10,060
behind him, I could see the caked and bloody
footprints he had left on the carpet ' "I've

548
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:15,410
got to talk to Joe right now," he reiterated
as if he hadn't heard me.' "There's something

549
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:21,910
in the trunk of my car something I found out
at the Virginia place. I've shot it and stabbed

550
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:28,920
it and I can't kill it. It's not human, and
I can't kill it" 'He began to giggle and then

551
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,810
to laugh and finally to scream. And he was
still screaming when I finally got Mr Woods

552
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:41,020
on the phone and told him to come, for God's
sake, to come as fast as he could '

553
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,270
It is not my purpose to tell Peter Andrews's
story, either. As a matter of fact, I am not

554
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:51,430
sure I would dare to tell it. Suffice it to
say that it was a tale so gruesome that I

555
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:56,310
dreamed of it for weeks afterwards, and Ellen
once looked at me over the breakfast table

556
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:01,900
and asked me why I had suddenly cried out
'His head! His head is still speaking in the

557
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,080
earth!' in the middle of the night 'I suppose
it was a dream,' I said. 'One of those you

558
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:14,191
can't remember afterwards.' But my eyes dropped
immediately to my coffee cup, and I think

559
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:19,640
that Ellen knew the lie that time.

560
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,680
One day in August of the following year, I
was buzzed as I worked in the Readers Library.

561
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,260
It was George Waterhouse. He asked me if I
could step up to his office. When I got there

562
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,420
I saw that Robert Garden was also there, and
Henry Effingham. For one moment I was positive

563
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:43,270
I was about to be accused of some really dreadful
act of stupidity or malfeasance.

564
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:47,510
Then Garden stepped around to me and said:
'George believes the time has come to make

565
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:52,360
you a junior partner, David. The rest of us
agree.'

566
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,390
'It's going to be a little bit like being
the world's oldest JayCee,' Effingham said

567
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,570
with a grin, 'but it's the channel you have
to go through, David. With any luck, we can

568
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:03,040
make you a full partner by Christmas.'

569
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:10,070
There were no bad dreams that night. Ellen
and I went out to dinner, drank too much,

570
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:14,860
went on to a jazz place where we hadn't been
in nearly six years, and listened to that

571
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:21,250
amazing blue-eyed black man, Dexter Gordon,
blow his horn until almost two in the morning.

572
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,650
We woke up the next morning with fluttery
stomachs and achey heads, both of us still

573
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,560
unable to completely believe what had happened.
One of them was that my salary had just climbed

574
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:37,490
by eight thousand dollars a year long after
our expectations of such a staggering income

575
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,580
jump had fallen by the wayside.

576
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:45,910
The firm sent me to Copenhagen for six weeks
that fall, and I returned to discover that

577
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:52,860
John Hanrahan, one of the regular attendees
at 249, had died of cancer. A collection was

578
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,870
taken up for his wife, who had been left in
unpleasant circumstances. I was pressed into

579
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:03,810
service to total the amount-which was given
entirely in cash-and convert it to a cashier's

580
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:09,501
check. It came to almost ten thousand dollars.
I turned the check over to Stevens and I suppose

581
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:11,050
he mailed it.

582
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:17,300
It just so happened that Arlene Hanrahan was
a member of Ellen's Theatre Society, and Ellen

583
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,500
told me some time later that Arlene had received
an anonymous check for ten thousand four hundred

584
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:29,210
dollars. Written on the check stub was the
brief and unilluminating message 'Friends

585
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,220
of your late husband John'.

586
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,120
'Isn't that the most amazing thing you ever
heard in your life?' Ellen asked me.

587
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:44,920
'No,' I said, 'but it's right up there in
the top ten. Are there any more strawberries,

588
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
Ellen?'

589
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,680
The years went by. I discovered a warren of
rooms upstairs at 249-a writing room, a bedroom

590
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,790
where guests sometimes stayed overnight (although
after that slithery bump I had heard-or imagined

591
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:05,130
I had heard- I believe I personally would
rather have registered at a good hotel), a

592
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:11,740
small but well-equipped gymnasium, and a sauna
bath. There was also a long, narrow room which

593
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,440
ran the length of the building and contained
two bowling alleys.

594
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:23,740
In those same years I re-read the novels of
Edward Gray Seville, and discovered an absolutely

595
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:31,690
stunning poet-the equal of Ezra Pound and
Wallace Stevens, perhaps-named Norbert Rosen.

596
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:36,010
According to the back flap on one of the three
volumes of his work in the stacks, he had

597
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:42,670
been born in 1924 and killed at Anzio. All
three volumes of his work had been published

598
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,700
by Stedham & Son, New York and Boston.

599
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,310
I remember going back to the New York Public
Library on a bright spring afternoon during

600
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:56,830
one of those years (of which year I am no
longer sure) and requesting twenty years'

601
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:03,970
worth of Literary Market Place. The LMP is
an annual publication the size of a large

602
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:09,370
city's Yellow Pages, and the reference room
librarian was quite put out with me, I'm afraid.

603
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:14,770
But I persisted, and went through each volume
carefully. And although LMP is supposed to

604
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:19,970
list every publisher, great and small, in
the United States (in addition to agents,

605
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:27,550
editors, and book club staffs), I found no
listing for Stedham & Son. A year later-or

606
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:32,750
perhaps it was two years later- I fell into
conversation with an antiquarian book dealer

607
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:37,920
and asked him about the imprint. He said he
had never heard of it.

608
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,920
I thought of asking Stevens-saw that warning
light in his eyes-and dropped the question

609
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,230
unasked.

610
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:55,300
And, over those years, there were stories.
Tales, to use Stevens's word. Funny tales,

611
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:01,370
tales of love found and love lost, tales of
unease. Yes, and even a few war stories, although

612
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:06,500
none of the sort Ellen had likely been thinking
of when she made the suggestion.

613
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:13,570
I remember Gerard Tozeman's story the most
clearly-the tale of an American base of operations

614
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:19,150
which took a direct hit from German artillery
four months before the end of World War I,

615
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,680
killing everyone present except for Tozeman
himself.

616
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:28,540
Lathrop Carruthers, the American general who
everyone had by then decided must be utterly

617
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:35,150
insane (he had been responsible for better
than eighteen thousand casualties by then-lives

618
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:40,320
and limbs spent as casually as you or I might
spend a quarter in a jukebox), was standing

619
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,660
at a map of the front lines when the shell
struck. He had been explaining yet another

620
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,750
mad flanking operation at that moment-an operation
which would have succeeded only on the level

621
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:56,060
of all the others Carruthers had hatched:
it would be wonderfully successful at making

622
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,060
new widows.

623
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:04,690
And when the dust cleared, Gerard Tozeman,
dazed and deaf, bleeding from his nose, his

624
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:10,810
ears, and the corners of both eyes, his testicles
already swelling from the force of the concussion,

625
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:15,910
had come upon Carruthers's body while looking
for a way out of the abbatoir that had been

626
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:23,860
the staff HQ only minutes before. He looked
at the general's body and then began to scream

627
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:29,640
and laugh. The sounds went unheard by his
own shellshocked ears, but they served to

628
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,800
notify the medicos that someone was still
alive in that strew of matchwood.

629
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,550
Carruthers had not been mutilated by the blast
at least, Tozeman said, it hadn't been what

630
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:47,470
the soldiers of that long-ago war had come
to think of as mutilation-men whose arms had

631
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:53,500
been blown off, men with no feet, no eyes;
men whose lungs had been shrivelled by gas.

632
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:01,170
No, he said, it was nothing like that The
man's mother would have known him at once.

633
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:08,420
But the map the map before which Carruthers
had been standing with his butcher's pointer

634
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,640
when the shell struck

635
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:20,900
It had somehow been driven into his face.
Tozeman had found himself staring into a hideous,

636
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:27,390
tattooed deathmask. Here was the stony shore
of Brittany on the bony ridge of Lathrop Carruthers's

637
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:33,490
brow. Here was the Rhine flowing like a blue
scar down his left cheek. Here were some or

638
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:39,130
the finest wine-growing provinces in the world
bumped and ridged over his chin. Here was

639
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:47,050
the Saar drawn around his throat like a hangman's
noose and printed across one bulging eyeball

640
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:52,210
was the word VERSAILLES.

641
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:57,640
That was our Christmas story in the year 197-.

642
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:03,760
I remember many others, but they do not belong
here. Properly speaking, Tozeman's doesn't,

643
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,380
either but it was the first 'Christmas tale'
I heard at 249, and I could not resist telling

644
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:15,200
it. And then, on the Thursday after Thanksgiving
of this year, when Stevens clapped his hands

645
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,860
together for attention and asked who would
favour us with a Christmas tale, Emlyn McCarron

646
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:29,020
growled: 'I suppose I've got something that
bears telling. Tell it now or tell it never;

647
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:32,870
God'll shut me up for good soon enough.'

648
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:38,710
In the years I had been coming to 249, I had
never heard McCarron tell a story. And perhaps

649
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:44,180
that's why I called the taxi so early, and
why, when Stevens passed out eggnog to the

650
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:51,940
six of us who had ventured out on that bellowing,
frigid night, I felt so keenly excited. Nor

651
00:59:51,940 --> 01:00:00,631
was I the only one; I saw that same excitement
on a good many other faces. McCarron, old

652
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:07,680
and dry and leathery, sat in the huge chair
by the fire with the packet of powder in his

653
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:14,220
gnarled hands. He tossed it in, and we watched
the flames shift colours madly before returning

654
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:21,090
to yellow again, Stevens passed among us with
brandy, and we passed him his Christmas honorariums.

655
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:26,931
Once, during that yearly ceremony, I heard
the clink of change passing from the hand

656
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:32,510
of the giver to the hand of the receiver;
on another occasion, I had seen a one thousand

657
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:38,510
dollar bill for a moment in the firelight.
On both occasions the murmur of Stevens's

658
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:47,350
voice had been exactly the same: low, considerate,
and entirely correct. Ten years, more or less,

659
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:53,250
had passed since I had first come to 249 with
George Waterhouse, and while much had changed

660
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:59,650
in the world outside, nothing had changed
in here, and Stevens seemed not to have aged

661
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:06,670
a month, or even a single day. He moved back
into the shadows, and for a moment there was

662
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:14,790
a silence so perfect that we could hear the
faint whistle of boiling sap escaping from

663
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:22,340
the burning logs on the hearth. Emlyn McCarron
was looking into the fire and we all followed

664
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:30,780
his gaze. The flames seemed particularly wild
that night. I felt almost hypnotized by the

665
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:36,460
sight of the fire-as, I suppose, the cavemen
who binned us were once hypnotized by it as

666
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,690
the wind walked and talked outside their cold
northern caves.

667
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:48,940
At last, still looking into the fire, bent
slightly forward so that his forearms rested

668
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:57,220
on his thighs and his clasped hands hung in
a knot between his knees, McCarron began to

669
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,540
speak.

670
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:07,660
CHAPTER TWO
The Breathing Method

671
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:14,600
I am nearly eighty now, which means that I
was born with the century. All my life I have

672
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,210
been associated with a building which stands
almost directly across from Madison Square

673
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:25,620
Garden; this building, which looks like a
great grey prison -something out of A Tale

674
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:31,800
of Two Cities-is actually a hospital, as most
of you know. It is Harriet White Memorial

675
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,970
Hospital. The Harriet White after whom it
was named was my father's first wife, and

676
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:42,390
she got her practical experience in nursing
when there were still actual sheep grazing

677
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:48,160
on the Sheep's Meadow in Central Park. A statue
of the lady herself (who would have been my

678
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,710
stepmother, had she still been alive when
I was born) stands on a pedestal in a pavillion

679
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,530
before the building, and if any of you have
seen it, you may have wondered how a woman

680
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:01,810
with such a stern and uncompromising face
could have found such a gentle occupation.

681
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:07,860
The motto chiselled into the statue's base,
once you get rid of the Latin folderol, is

682
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:14,860
even less comforting: There is no comfort
without pain; thus we define salvation through

683
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:23,440
suffering. Cato, if you please or if you don't
please! I was born inside that grey stone

684
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,160
building on 20 March, 1900. I returned there
as an intern in the year 1926. Twenty-six

685
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:36,260
is old to be just starting out in the world
of medicine, but I had done a more practical

686
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:42,680
internship in France, at the end of World
War I, trying to pack ruptured guts back into

687
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:49,120
stomachs that had been blown wide open and
dealing on the black market for morphine which

688
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:55,140
was often tinctured and sometimes dangerous.
As with the generation of physicians following

689
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,540
World War II, we were a bedrock-practical
lot of sawbones, and the records of the major

690
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:07,710
medical schools show a remarkably small number
of washouts in the years 1919 to 1928. We

691
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:13,730
were older, more experienced, steadier. Were
we also wiser? I don't know but we were certainly

692
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:20,220
more cynical. There was none of this nonsense
you read about in the popular medical novels,

693
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:25,680
stuff about fainting or vomiting at one's
first autopsy. Not after Belleau Wood, where

694
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,890
mamma rats sometimes raised whole litters
of ratlings in the gas-exploded intestines

695
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:37,220
of the soldiers left to rot in no-man's land.
We had gotten all our puking and passing out

696
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,660
behind us.

697
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,100
The Harriet White Memorial Hospital also figured
largely in something that happened to me nine

698
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:49,650
years after I had interned there-and this
is the story I want to tell you gentlemen

699
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:55,880
tonight. It is not a tale to be told at Christmas,
you would say (although its final scene was

700
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,410
played out on Christmas Eve), and yet, while
it is certainly horrible, it also seems to

701
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:08,530
express to me all the amazing power of our
cursed, doomed species. In it I see the wonder

702
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:14,369
of our will and also its horrible, tenebrous
power.

703
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:19,650
Birth itself, gentlemen, is a horrid thing
to many; it is the fashion now that fathers

704
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:24,560
should be present at the birth of their children,
and while this fashion has served to indict

705
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,220
many men with a guilt which I feel they may
not deserve (it is a guilt which some women

706
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:35,480
use knowingly and with an almost prescient
cruelty), it seems by and large to be a healthful,

707
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:43,650
salubrious thing. Yet I have seen men leave
the delivery room white and tottering and

708
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:49,910
I have seen them swoon like girls, overcome
by the cries and the blood. I remember one

709
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:55,460
father who held up just fine only to begin
screaming hysterically as his perfectly healthy

710
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:01,740
son pushed its way into the world. The infant's
eyes were open, it gave the impression of

711
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:09,760
looking around and then its eyes settled on
the father. Birth is wonderful, gentlemen,

712
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,610
but I have never found it beautiful-not by
any stretch of the imagination. I believe

713
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:21,110
it is too brutal to be beautiful. A woman's
womb is like an engine. With conception, that

714
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:26,980
engine is turned on. At first it barely idles
but as the creative cycle nears the climax

715
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:33,340
of birth, that engine revs up and up and up.
Its idling whisper becomes a steady running

716
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,970
hum, and then a rumble, and finally a bellowing,
frightening roar. Once that silent engine

717
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:45,040
has been turned on, every mother-to-be understands
that her life is in check. Either she will

718
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:50,830
bring the baby forth and the engine will shut
down again, or that engine will pound louder

719
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:58,260
and harder and faster until it explodes, killing
her in blood and pain.

720
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:05,619
This is a story of birth, gentlemen, on the
eve of that birth we have celebrated for almost

721
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:09,250
two thousand years.

722
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:15,760
I began practising medicine in 1929-a bad
year to begin anything. My grandfather was

723
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,450
able to loan me a small sum of money, so I
was luckier than many of my colleagues, but

724
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:24,480
I still had to survive over the next four
years mostly on my wits.

725
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,920
By 1935, things had improved a bit. I had
developed a bedrock of steady patients and

726
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,250
was getting quite a few outpatient referrals
from White Memorial. In April of that year

727
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:42,470
I saw a new patient, a young woman whom I
will call Sandra Stansfield-that name is close

728
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:47,990
enough to what her name really was. This was
a young woman, white, who stated her age to

729
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:53,590
be twenty-eight. After examining her, I guessed
her true age to be between three and five

730
01:07:53,590 --> 01:08:00,030
years younger than that. She was blonde, slender,
and tall for that time-about five feet eight

731
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:06,450
inches. She was quite beautiful, but in an
austere way that was almost forbidding. Her

732
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:11,500
features were clear and regular, her eyes
intelligent and her mouth every bit as determined

733
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,190
as the stone mouth of Harriet White on the
statue in the pavilion across from Madison

734
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:22,210
Square Garden. The name she put on her form
was not Sandra Stansfield but Jane Smith.

735
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:26,230
My examination subsequently showed her to
be about two months gone in pregnancy. She

736
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:32,000
wore no wedding ring. After the preliminary
exam-but before the results of the pregnancy

737
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,480
test were in, my nurse, Ella Davidson, said:
"That girl yesterday? Jane Smith? If that

738
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,940
isn't an assumed name, I never heard one.'

739
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:48,279
I agreed. Still, I rather admired her. She
had not engaged in the usual shillyshallying,

740
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:53,900
toe-scuffing, blushing, tearful behaviour.
She had been straightforward and businesslike.

741
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,690
Even her alias had seemed more a matter of
business than of shame. There had been no

742
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:06,069
attempt to provide verisimilitude by creating
a 'Betty Rucklehouse' or whomping up a 'Ternina

743
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:10,790
DeVille'. You require a name for your form,
she seemed to be saying, because that is the

744
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:15,080
law. So here is a name; but rather than trusting
to the professional ethics of a man I don't

745
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:21,620
know, I'll trust in myself. If you don't mind,
Ella sniffed and passed a few remarks-'modern

746
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:27,520
girls' and 'bold as brass'-but she was a good
woman, and I don't think she said those things

747
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,900
except for the sake of form. She knew as well
as I did that, whatever my new patient might

748
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:39,480
be, she was no little trollop with hard eyes
and round heels. No; 'Jane Smith' was merely

749
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,940
an extremely serious, extremely determined
young woman-if either of those things can

750
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:52,040
be described by such a milquetoast adverb
as 'merely'. It was an unpleasant situation

751
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,710
(it used to be called 'getting in a scrape',
as you gentlemen may remember; nowadays it

752
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:02,290
seems that many young women use a scrape to
get out of the scrape), and she meant to go

753
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,230
through it with whatever grace and dignity
she could manage.

754
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:12,880
A week after her initial appointment, she
came in again. That was a peach of a day-one

755
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:21,380
of the first real days of spring. The air
was mild, the sky a soft, milky shade of blue,

756
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:27,360
and there was a smell on the breeze- a warm,
indefinable smell that seems to be nature's

757
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,911
signal that she is entering her own birth
cycle again. The sort of day when you wish

758
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:39,710
you were miles from any responsibility, sitting
opposite a lovely woman of your own-at Coney

759
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:44,650
Island, maybe, or on the Palisades across
the Hudson with a picnic hamper on a checkered

760
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:51,130
cloth and the lady in question wearing a great
white cartwheel hat and a sleeveless gown

761
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,370
as pretty as the day.

762
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:59,290
'Jane Smith's' dress had sleeves, but it was
still almost as pretty as the day; a smart

763
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:05,130
white linen with brown edging. She wore brown
pumps, white gloves, and a cloche hat that

764
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:11,290
was slightly out of fashion-it was the first
sign I saw that she was a far from rich woman.

765
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:16,500
'You're pregnant,' I said. 'I don't believe
you doubted it much, did you?'

766
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,960
If there are to be tears, I thought, they
will come now.

767
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,750
'No,' she said with perfect composure. There
was no more a sign of tears in her eyes than

768
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:30,670
there were rainclouds on the horizon that
day. 'I'm very regular as a rule.'

769
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,860
There was a pause between us.

770
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:39,311
'When may I expect to deliver?' she asked
then, with an almost soundless sigh. It was

771
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:44,280
the sound a man or woman might make before
bending over to pick up a heavy load.

772
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:49,540
'It will be a Christmas baby,' I said. '10
December is the date I'll give you, but it

773
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,720
could be two weeks on either side of that'

774
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:56,560
'All right.' She hesitated briefly, and then
plunged ahead. 'Will you attend me? Even though

775
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,860
I'm not married?'

776
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,720
'Yes,' I said. 'On one condition.'

777
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,370
She frowned, and in that moment her face was
more like the face of Harriet White, my father's

778
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:09,960
first wife, than ever. One would not think
that the frown of a woman perhaps only twenty-three

779
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,731
could be particularly formidable, but this
one was. She was ready to leave, and the fact

780
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:18,940
that she would have to go through this entire
embarrassing process again with another doctor

781
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,430
was not going to deter her.

782
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:25,210
'And what might that be?' she asked with perfect,
colourless courtesy.

783
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:31,310
Now it was I who felt an urge to drop my eyes
from her steady hazel ones, but I held her

784
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:38,020
gaze. 'I insist upon knowing your real name.
We can continue to do business on a cash basis

785
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,890
if that is how you prefer it, and I can continue
to have Mrs Davidson issue you receipts in

786
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:47,630
the name of Jane Smith. But if we are going
to travel through the next seven months or

787
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:51,420
so together, I would like to be able to address
you by the name to which you answer in all

788
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:53,730
the rest of your life.'

789
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:58,630
I finished this absurdly stiff little speech
and watched her think it through. I was somehow

790
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:03,170
quite sure she was going to stand up, thank
me for my time, and leave forever. I was going

791
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:09,070
to feel disappointed if that happened. I liked
her. Even more, I liked the straightforward

792
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:13,210
way she was handling a problem which would
have reduced ninety women out of a hundred

793
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:20,060
to inept and undignified liars, terrified
by the living clock within and so deeply ashamed

794
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:25,900
of their situation that to make any reasonable
plan for coping with it became impossible.

795
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:31,401
I suppose many young people today would find
such a state of mind ludicrous, ugly, even

796
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:37,280
hard to believe. People have become so eager
to demonstrate their broad-mindedness that

797
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,340
a pregnant woman who has no wedding ring is
apt to be treated with twice the solicitude

798
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:51,650
of one who does. You gentlemen will well remember
when rectitude and hypocrisy were combined

799
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:58,270
to make a situation that was viciously difficult
for a woman who had gotten herself 'in a scrape'.

800
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:03,730
In those days, a married pregnant woman was
a radiant woman, sure of her position and

801
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:08,820
proud of fulfilling what she considered to
be the function God put her on earth for.

802
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:15,110
An unmarried pregnant woman was a trollop
in the eyes of the world and apt to be a trollop

803
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:22,290
in her own eyes as well. They were, to use
Ella Davidson's word, 'easy', and in that

804
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:29,540
world and that time, easiness was not quickly
forgiven. Such women crept away to have their

805
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:36,000
babies in other towns or cities. Some took
pills or jumped from buildings. Others went

806
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,790
to butcher abortionists with dirty hands or
tried to do the job themselves; in my time

807
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:46,350
as a physician I have seen four women die
of blood-loss before my eyes as the result

808
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:52,020
of punctured wombs-in one case the puncturing
was done by the jagged neck of a Dr Pepper

809
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:58,150
bottle that had been tied to the handle of
a whisk-broom. It is hard to believe now that

810
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:04,120
such things happened, but they did, gentlemen.
They did. It was, quite simply, the worst

811
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,190
situation a healthy young woman could find
herself in.

812
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:13,461
'All right' she said at last. 'That's fair
enough. My name is Sandra Stansfield.' And

813
01:15:13,461 --> 01:15:19,920
she held her hand out. Rather amazed, I took
it and shook it. I'm rather glad Ella

814
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,070
Davidson didn't see me do that. She would
have made no comment, but the coffee would

815
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,230
have been bitter for the next week.

816
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:32,670
She smiled-at my own expression of bemusement,
I imagine-and looked at me frankly.

817
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:37,400
'I hope we can be friends, Dr McCarron. I
need a friend just now. I'm quite frightened.'

818
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,380
'I can understand that, and I'll try to be
your friend if I can, Miss Stansfield. Is

819
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,840
there anything I can do for you now?'

820
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,210
She opened her handbag and took out a dime-store
pad and a pen. She opened the pad, poised

821
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:56,239
the pen, and looked up at me. For one horrified
instant I believed she was going to ask me

822
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:01,360
for the name and address of an abortionist.
Then she said: 'I'd like to know the best

823
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,340
things to eat. For the baby, I mean.'

824
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:07,580
I laughed out loud. She looked at me with
some amazement.

825
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,000
'Forgive me-it's just that you seem so businesslike.'

826
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,170
'I suppose,' she said. 'This baby is part
of my business now, isn't it, Dr McCarron?'

827
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:22,690
'Yes. Of course it is. And I have a folder
which I give to all my pregnant patients.

828
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,790
It deals with diet and weight and drinking
and smoking and lots of other things. Please

829
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,220
don't laugh when you look at it. You'll hurt
my feelings if you do, because I wrote it

830
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:31,570
myself.'

831
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:36,340
And so I had-although it was really more of
a pamphlet than a folder, and in time became

832
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:42,070
my book, A Practical Guide to Pregnancy and
Delivery. I was quite interested in obstetrics

833
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:47,800
and gynaecology in those days-still am -although
it was not a thing to specialize in back then

834
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,590
unless you had plenty of uptown connections.
Even if you did, it might take ten or fifteen

835
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:58,820
years to establish a strong practice. Having
hung out my shingle at a rather too-ripe age

836
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:03,890
as a result of the war, I didn't feel I had
the time to spare. I contented myself with

837
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:08,170
the knowledge that I would see a great many
happy expectant mothers and deliver a great

838
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:13,820
many babies in the course of my general practice.
And so I did; at last count I had delivered

839
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:18,620
well over two thousand babies -enough to fill
two hundred classrooms.

840
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,180
I kept up with the literature on having babies
more smartly than I did on that applying to

841
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:28,770
any other area of general practice. And because
my opinions were strong, enthusiastic ones,

842
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:34,690
I wrote my own pamphlet rather than just passing
along the stale chestnuts so often foisted

843
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:39,210
on young mothers then. I won't run through
the whole catalogue of these chestnuts-we'd

844
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:42,600
be here all night-but I'll mention a couple.

845
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,620
Expectant mothers were urged to stay off their
feet as much as possible, and on no account

846
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:53,820
were they to walk any sustained distance lest
a miscarriage or 'birth damage' result. Now

847
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:59,040
giving birth is an extremely strenuous piece
of work, and such advice is like telling a

848
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:03,470
football player to prepare for the big game
by sitting around as much as possible so he

849
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:10,480
won't tire himself out! Another sterling piece
of advice, given by a good many doctors, was

850
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,850
that moderately overweight mothers-to-be take
up smoking smoking! The rationale was perfectly

851
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:22,290
expressed by an advertising slogan of the
day: 'Have a Lucky instead of a sweet.' People

852
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:26,900
who have the idea that when we entered the
twentieth century we also entered an age of

853
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:33,480
medical light and reason have no idea of how
utterly crazy medicine could sometimes be.

854
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,900
Perhaps it's just as well; their hair would
turn white.

855
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,140
I gave Miss Stansfield my folder and she looked
through it with complete attention for perhaps

856
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:45,520
five minutes. I asked her permission to smoke
my pipe and she gave it absently, without

857
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,270
looking up. When she did look up at last,
there was a small smile on her lips. 'Are

858
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,750
you a radical, Dr McCarron?' she asked.

859
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:59,651
'Why do you say that? Because I advise that
the expectant mother should walk her round

860
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:04,360
of errands instead of riding in a smoky, jolting
subway car?'

861
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:11,540
'"Pre-natal vitamins," whatever they are swimming
recommended and breathing exercises! What

862
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,130
breathing exercises?'

863
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:19,640
'That comes later on, and no-I'm not a radical.
Far from it What I am is five minutes overdue

864
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,540
on my next patient.'

865
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:26,870
'Oh! I'm sorry.' She got to her feet quickly,
tucking the thick folder into her purse.

866
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,930
'No need.'

867
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:34,310
She shrugged into her light coat, looking
at me with those direct hazel eyes as she

868
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,310
did so.

869
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:39,740
'No,' she said. 'Not a radical at all. I suspect
you're actually quite comfortable? Is that

870
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,740
the word I want?'

871
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:46,380
'I hope it will serve,' I said. 'It's a word
I like. If you speak to Mrs Davidson, shell

872
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:50,410
give you an appointment schedule. I'll want
to see you again early next month.'

873
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:54,290
'Your Mrs Davidson doesn't approve of me.'

874
01:19:54,290 --> 01:20:00,280
'Oh, I'm sure that's not true at all.' But
I've never been a particularly good liar,

875
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,970
and the warmth between us suddenly slipped
away. I did not accompany her to the door

876
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:10,450
of my consulting room. 'Miss Stansfield?'
She turned towards me, coolly enquiring. 'Do

877
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:13,040
you intend to keep the baby?'

878
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,780
She considered me briefly and then smiled-
a secret smile which I am convinced only pregnant

879
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:24,220
women know. 'Oh yes,' she said, and let herself
out. By the end of that day I had treated

880
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:29,200
identical twins for identical cases of poison
ivy, lanced a boil, removed a hook of metal

881
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:33,770
from a sheet-welder's eye, and had referred
one of my oldest patients to White Memorial

882
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:40,380
for what was surely cancer. I had forgotten
all about Sandra Stansfield by then. Ella

883
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:46,239
Davidson recalled her to my mind by saying:
'Perhaps she's not a chippie after all.'

884
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,980
I looked up from my last patient's folder.
I had been looking at it, feeling that useless

885
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:55,680
disgust most doctors feel when they know they
have been rendered completely helpless, and

886
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,700
thinking I ought to have a rubber stamp made
up for such files-only instead of saying ACCOUNT

887
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:07,190
RECEIVABLE or PAID IN FULL or PATIENT MOVED,
it would simply say DEATH-WARRANT. Perhaps

888
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:12,230
with a skull and crossbones above, like those
on bottles of poison. 'Pardon me?'

889
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:17,480
'Your Miss Jane Smith. She did a most peculiar
thing after her appointment this morning.'

890
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,480
The set of Mrs Davidson's head and mouth made
it clear that this was the sort of peculiar

891
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,880
thing of which she approved. 'And what was
that?'

892
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:32,290
'When I gave her her appointment card, she
asked me to tot up her expenses. All of her

893
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:34,880
expenses. Delivery and hospital stay included.'

894
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,210
That was a peculiar thing, all right. This
was 1935, remember, and Miss Stansfield gave

895
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:47,610
every impression of being a woman on her own.
Was she well off, even comfortably off? I

896
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:53,480
didn't think so. Her dress, shoes, and gloves
had all been smart, but she had worn no jewellery

897
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:58,410
-not even costume jewellery. And then there
was her hat, that decidedly out-of-date cloche.

898
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:01,350
'Did you do it?' I asked.

899
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,410
Mrs Davidson looked at me as though I might
have lost my senses. 'Did I? Of course I did!

900
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:09,260
And she paid the entire amount. In cash.'

901
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,760
The last, which apparently had surprised Mrs
Davidson the most (in an extremely pleasant

902
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,541
way, of course), surprised me not at all.
One thing which the Jane Smiths of the world

903
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:22,280
can't do is write cheques.

904
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,130
Took a bank-book out of her purse, opened
it, and counted the money right out onto my

905
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:30,170
desk,' Mrs Davidson was continuing. Then she
put her receipt in where the

906
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:35,290
cash had been, put the bank-book into her
purse again, and said good day. Not half bad,

907
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:38,960
when you think of the way we've had to chase
some of these so-called "respectable" people

908
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,400
to make them pay their bills!'

909
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,460
I felt chagrined for some reason. I was not
happy with the Stansfield woman for having

910
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:51,190
done such a thing, with Mrs Davidson for being
so pleased and complacent with the arrangement,

911
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:56,500
and with myself, for some reason I couldn't
define then and can't now. Something about

912
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:03,690
it made me feel small. 'But she couldn't very
well pay for a hospital stay now, could she?'

913
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:09,660
I asked-it was a ridiculously small thing
to seize on, but it was all I could find at

914
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:14,790
that moment on which to express my pique and
half-amused frustration. 'After all, none

915
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:20,120
of us know how long shell have to remain there.
Or are you reading the crystal now, Ella?'

916
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:25,620
'I told her that very thing, and she asked
what the average stay was following an uncomplicated

917
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:29,010
birth. I told her three days. Wasn't that
right, Dr McCarron?'

918
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:30,760
I had to admit it was.

919
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,430
'She said that she would pay for three days,
then, and if it was longer, she would pay

920
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,611
the difference, and if-'

921
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:43,270
'- if it was shorter, we could issue her a
refund,' I finished wearily. I thought: Damn

922
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:48,660
the woman, anyway!-and then I laughed. She
had guts. One couldn't deny that. All kinds

923
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,630
of guts.

924
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:58,280
Mrs Davidson allowed herself a smile and if
I am ever tempted, now that I am in my dotage,

925
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,820
to believe I know all there is to know about
one of my fellow creatures, I try to remember

926
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:10,980
that smile. Before that day I would have staked
my life that I would never see Mrs Davidson,

927
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:15,980
one of the most 'proper' women I have ever
known, smile fondly as she thought about a

928
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,620
girl who was pregnant out of wedlock.

929
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:28,070
'Guts? I don't know, Doctor. But she knows
her own mind, that one. She certainly does.'

930
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:33,180
A month passed, and Miss Stansfield showed
up promptly for her appointment, simply appearing

931
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:39,860
out of that wide, amazing flow of humanity
that was New York then and is New York now.

932
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:44,730
She wore a fresh-looking blue dress to which
she managed to communicate a feeling of originality,

933
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:49,680
of one-of-a-kind-ness, despite the fact that
it had been quite obviously picked from a

934
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:54,610
rack of dozens just like it. Her pumps did
not match it; they were the same brown ones

935
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,560
in which I had seen her last time.

936
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,770
I checked her over carefully and found her
normal in every way. I told her so and she

937
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:05,110
was pleased. 'I found the pre-natal vitamins,
Dr McCarron.'

938
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:06,980
'Did you? That's good.'

939
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:11,120
Her eyes sparkled impishly. "The druggist
advised me against them.'

940
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:16,590
'God save me from pestle-pounders,' I said,
and she giggled against the heel of her palm-it

941
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:24,110
was a childlike gesture, winning in its unselfconsciousness.
'I never met a druggist that wasn't a frustrated

942
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:29,180
doctor. And a Republican. Pre-natal vitamins
are new, so they're regarded with suspicion.

943
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:30,810
Did you take his advice?'

944
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,440
'No, I took yours. You're my doctor.'

945
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,460
Thank you.'

946
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:40,272
'Not at all.' She looked at me straightforwardly,
not giggling now. 'Dr McCarron, when will

947
01:25:40,272 --> 01:25:41,600
I begin to show?'

948
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,450
'Not until August, I should guess. September,
if you choose garments which are uh, voluminous.'

949
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:52,880
Thank you.' She picked up her purse but did
not rise immediately to go. I thought that

950
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,700
she wanted to talk and didn't know where or
how to begin.

951
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,480
'You're a working woman, I take it?'

952
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,450
She nodded. 'Yes. I work.'

953
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:04,980
'Might I ask where? If you'd rather I didn't
-'

954
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:10,940
She laughed- a brittle, humourless laugh,
as different from that giggle as day is from

955
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:16,370
dark. 'In a department store. Where else does
an unmarried woman work in the city? I sell

956
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:21,280
perfume to fat ladies who rinse their hair
and then have it done up in tiny finger-waves.'

957
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,940
'How long will you continue?'

958
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:28,840
'Until my delicate condition is noticed. I
suppose then I'll be asked to leave, lest

959
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,571
I upset any of the fat ladies. The shock of
being waited on by a pregnant woman with no

960
01:26:33,571 --> 01:26:37,520
wedding-band might cause their hair to straighten.'

961
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:42,590
Quite suddenly her eyes were bright with tears.
Her lips began to tremble, and I groped for

962
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:48,540
a handkerchief. But the tears didn't fall-not
so much as a single one. Her eyes brimmed

963
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:53,920
for a moment and then she blinked them back.
Her lips tightened and then smoothed out.

964
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,610
She simply decided she was not going to lose
control of her emotions and she did not. It

965
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:00,590
was a remarkable thing to watch.

966
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:05,940
'I'm sorry,' she said. 'You've been very kind
to me. I won't repay your kindness with what

967
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,170
would be a very common story.'

968
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:10,190
She rose to go, and I rose with her.

969
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:15,180
'I'm not a bad listener,' I said, 'and I have
some time. My next patient cancelled.'

970
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:18,410
'No,' she said. 'Thank you, but no.'

971
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:22,070
'All right,' I said. 'But there's something
else.'

972
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,070
'Yes?'

973
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:28,710
'It's not my policy to make my patients-any
of my patients-pay for services in advance

974
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:35,320
of those services being rendered. I hope if
you that is, if you feel you'd like to or

975
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,820
have to' I fumbled my way into silence.

976
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:44,260
I've been in New York four years, Dr McCarron,
and I'm thrifty by nature. After August-or

977
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:48,760
September-I'll have to live on what's in my
savings account until I can go back to work

978
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:54,710
again. It's not a great amount and sometimes,
during the nights, mostly, I become frightened.'

979
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:58,420
She looked at me steadily with those wonderful
hazel eyes.

980
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:05,489
'It seemed better to me-safer-to pay for the
baby first. Ahead of everything. Because that

981
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:10,239
is where the baby is in my thoughts, and because,
later on, the temptation to spend that money

982
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,550
might become very great'

983
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:19,860
'All right,' I said. 'But please remember
that I see it as having been paid before accounts.

984
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,320
If you need it, say so.'

985
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:27,620
'And bring out the dragon in Mrs Davidson
again?' The impish light was back in her eyes.

986
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:30,420
'I don't think so. And now, Doctor-'

987
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:34,850
'You intend to work as long as possible? Absolutely
as long as possible?'

988
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,489
'Yes. I have to. Why?'

989
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:41,900
'I think I'm going to frighten you a little
before you go,' I said.

990
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:47,310
Her eyes widened slightly. 'Don't do that,'
she said. 'I'm frightened enough already.'

991
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:52,590
'Which is exactly why I'm going to do it Sit
down again, Miss Stansfield.' And when she

992
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:56,320
only stood there, I added: 'Please.'

993
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,980
She sat. Reluctantly.

994
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:02,800
'You're in a unique and unenviable position,'
I told her, leaning back against the examination

995
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,890
table. 'You are dealing with the situation
with remarkable grace.'

996
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:09,780
She began to speak, and I held up my hand
to silence her.

997
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:14,570
'That's good. I salute you for it But I would
hate to see you hurt your baby in any way

998
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:20,610
out of concern for your own financial security.
I had a patient who, in spite of my strenuous

999
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:26,320
advice to the contrary, continued packing
herself into a girdle month after month, strapping

1000
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:32,890
it tighter and tighter as her pregnancy progressed.
She was a vain, stupid, tiresome woman, and

1001
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:37,570
I don't believe she really wanted the baby
anyway. I don't subscribe to many of these

1002
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:42,110
theories of the subconscious which everyone
seems to discuss over the Man-Jong boards

1003
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:47,160
these days, but if I did, I would say that
she-or some part of her-was trying to kill

1004
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,660
the baby.'

1005
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,590
'And did she?' Her face was very still.

1006
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:57,570
'No, not at all. But the baby was born retarded.
It's very possible that the baby would have

1007
01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:01,660
been born retarded anyway, and I'm not saying
otherwise-we know next to nothing about what

1008
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:05,410
causes such things. But she may have caused
it.'

1009
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:11,350
'I take your point,' she said in a low voice.
'You don't want me to to pack myself in so

1010
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:15,741
I can work another month or six weeks. I'll
admit the thought had crossed my mind. So

1011
01:30:15,741 --> 01:30:18,830
thank you for the fright.'

1012
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:22,980
This time I walked her to the door. I would
have liked to ask her just how much-or how

1013
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:28,040
little-she had left in that savings book,
and just how close to the edge she was. It

1014
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:32,940
was a question she would not answer; I knew
that well enough. So I merely bade her goodbye

1015
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:38,350
and made a joke about her vitamins. She left
I found myself thinking about her at odd moments

1016
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:45,890
over the next month, and-Johanssen interrupted
McCarron's story at this point. They were

1017
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:50,390
old friends, and I suppose that gave him the
right to ask the question that had surely

1018
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:52,860
crossed all our minds.

1019
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:59,630
'Did you love her, Emlyn? Is that what all
this is about, this stuff about her eyes and

1020
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:03,260
smile and how you "thought of her at odd moments"?'

1021
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:07,300
I thought that McCarron might be annoyed at
this interruption, but he was not. 'You have

1022
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:12,050
a right to ask the question,' he said, and
paused, looking into the fire. It seemed that

1023
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:18,450
he might almost have fallen into a doze. Then
a dry knot of wood exploded, sending sparks

1024
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:24,570
up the chimney in a swirl, and McCarron looked
around, first at Johanssen and then at the

1025
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:26,090
rest of us.

1026
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:31,350
'No. I didn't love her. The things I've said
about her sound like the things a man who

1027
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:35,840
is falling in love would notice-her eyes,
her dresses, her laugh.' He lit his pipe with

1028
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,300
a special boltlike pipe-lighter that he carried,
drawing the flame until there was a bed of

1029
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:47,220
coals there. Then he snapped the bolt shut,
dropped it into the pocket of his jacket,

1030
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:55,120
and blew out a plume of smoke that shifted
slowly around his head in an aromatic membrane.

1031
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:02,489
'I admired her. That was the long and short
of it. And my admiration grew with each of

1032
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:08,350
her visits. I suppose some of you sense this
as a story of love crossed by circumstance.

1033
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:13,790
Nothing could be further from the truth. Her
story came out a bit at a time over the next

1034
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:18,420
half-year or so, and when you gentlemen hear
it, I think you'll agree that it was every

1035
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,760
bit as common as she herself said it was.
She had been drawn to the city like a thousand

1036
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,260
other girls; she had come from a small town

1037
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:32,010
in Iowa or Nebraska. Or possibly it was Minnesota-I
don't really remember anymore.

1038
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:37,430
She had done a lot of high school dramatics
and community theatre in her small town-good

1039
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:42,870
reviews in the local weekly written by a drama
critic with an English degree from Cow and

1040
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:48,300
Sileage Junior College-and she came to New
York to try a career in acting.

1041
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:53,489
She was practical even about that-as practical
as an impractical ambition will allow one

1042
01:32:53,489 --> 01:32:58,570
to be, anyway. She came to New York, she told
me, because she didn't believe the unstated

1043
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:04,330
thesis of the movie magazines-that any girl
who came to Hollywood could become a star,

1044
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:09,050
that she might be sipping a soda in Schwab's
Drug Store one day and playing opposite Gable

1045
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:13,840
or MacMurray the next. She came to New York,
she said, because she thought it might be

1046
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,430
easier to get her foot in the door there and,
I think, because the legitimate theatre interested

1047
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,620
her more than the talkies.

1048
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:25,200
She got a job selling perfume in one of the
big department stores and enrolled in acting

1049
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:32,010
classes. She was smart and terribly determined,
this girl-her will was pure steel, through

1050
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:37,950
and through-but she was as human as anyone
else. She was lonely, too. Lonely in a way

1051
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:43,840
that perhaps only single girls fresh from
small midwestern towns know. Homesickness

1052
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,160
is not always a vague, nostalgic, almost beautiful
emotion, although that is somehow the way

1053
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:55,600
we always seem to picture it in our mind.
It can be a terribly keen blade, not just

1054
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:01,410
a sickness in metaphor but in fact as well.
It can change the way one looks at the world;

1055
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:07,560
the faces one sees in the street look not
just indifferent but ugly perhaps even malignant.

1056
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:14,820
Homesickness is a real sickness-the ache of
the uprooted plant. Miss Stansfield, admirable

1057
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:21,180
as she may have been, determined as she may
have been, was not immune to it And the rest

1058
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:27,730
follows so naturally it needs no telling.
There was a young man in her acting classes.

1059
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:32,790
The two of them went out several times. She
did not love him, but she needed a friend.

1060
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:38,210
By the time she discovered he was not that
and never would be, there had been two incidents.

1061
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:43,550
Sexual incidents. She discovered she was pregnant.
She told the young man, who told her he would

1062
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:48,770
stand by her and 'do the decent thing'. A
week later he was gone from his lodgings,

1063
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:53,990
leaving no forwarding address. That was when
she came to me.

1064
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:58,390
During her fourth month, I introduced Miss
Stansfield to the Breathing Method-what is

1065
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:03,410
today called the Lamaze Method. In those days,
you understand, Monsieur Lamaze was yet to

1066
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:04,640
be heard from.

1067
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:09,670
'In those days'-the phrase has cropped up
again and again, I notice. I apologize for

1068
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:14,780
it but am unable to help it-so much of what
I have told you and will tell you happened

1069
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:18,670
as it did because it happened 'in those days'.

1070
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:25,260
So 'in those days', over forty-five years
ago, a visit to the delivery rooms in any

1071
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:30,860
large American hospital would have sounded
to you like a visit to a madhouse. Women weeping

1072
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:35,199
wildly, women screaming that they wished they
were dead, women screaming that they could

1073
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:41,070
not bear such agony, women screaming for Christ
to forgive them their sins, women screaming

1074
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:45,890
out strings of curses and gutter-words their
husbands and fathers never would have believed

1075
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:50,739
they knew. All of this was quite the accepted
thing, in spite of the fact that most of the

1076
01:35:50,739 --> 01:35:55,550
world's women give birth in almost complete
silence, aside from the grunting sounds of

1077
01:35:55,550 --> 01:36:01,280
strain that we would associate with any piece
of hard physical labour.

1078
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:05,989
Doctors were responsible for some of this
hysteria, I'm sorry to say. The stories the

1079
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:10,260
pregnant woman heard from friends and relatives
who had already been through the birthing

1080
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:15,140
process also contributed to it. Believe me:
if you are told that some experience is going

1081
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:21,090
to hurt, it will hurt. Most pain is in the
mind, and when a woman absorbs the idea that

1082
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:26,280
the act of giving birth is excruciatingly
painful-when she gets this information from

1083
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:31,840
her mother, her sisters, her married friends,
and her physician-that woman has been mentally

1084
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,360
prepared to feel great agony.

1085
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,700
Even after only six years' practice, I had
become used to seeing women who were trying

1086
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:43,940
to cope with a twofold problem: not just the
fact that they were pregnant and must plan

1087
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:50,250
for the new arrival, but also the fact-what
most of them saw as a fact, anyway-that they

1088
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:56,250
had entered the valley of the shadow of death.
Many were actually trying to put their affairs

1089
01:36:56,250 --> 01:37:01,120
in coherent order so that if they should die,
their husbands would be able to carry on without

1090
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,360
them.

1091
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:07,280
This is neither the time nor place for a lesson
on obstetrics, but you should know that for

1092
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,010
a long time before 'those days', the act of
giving birth was extremely dangerous in the

1093
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:16,969
Western countries. A revolution in medical
procedure, beginning around 1900, had made

1094
01:37:16,969 --> 01:37:23,199
the process much safer, but an absurdly small
number of doctors bothered to tell their expectant

1095
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:29,050
mothers that. God knows why. But in light
of this, is it any wonder that most delivery

1096
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:35,090
rooms sounded like Ward Nine in Bellevue?
Here are these poor women, their time come

1097
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:40,300
round at last, experiencing a process which
has, because of the almost Victorian decorum

1098
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:46,090
of the times, been described to them only
in the vaguest of terms; here are these women

1099
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:51,860
experiencing that engine of birth finally
running at full power. They were seized with

1100
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:58,180
an awe and wonder which they immediately interpreted
as insupportable pain, and most of them felt

1101
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:04,219
that they would very shortly die a dog's death.
In the course of my reading on the subject

1102
01:38:04,219 --> 01:38:09,390
of pregnancy, I discovered the principle of
the silent birth and the idea of the Breathing

1103
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:14,660
Method. Screaming wastes energy which would
be better used to expel the baby, it causes

1104
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:19,820
the women to hyperventilate, and hyperventilation
puts the body on an emergency basis-adrenals

1105
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:27,630
running full blast, respiration and pulse-rate
up-that is really unnecessary. The Breathing

1106
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:32,570
Method was supposed to help the mother focus
her attention on the job at hand and to cope

1107
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:36,739
with pain by utilizing the body's own resources.

1108
01:38:36,739 --> 01:38:43,780
It was used widely at that time in India and
Africa; in America, the Shoshone, Kiowa, and

1109
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:49,260
Micmac Indians all used it; the Eskimos have
always used it; but, as you may guess, most

1110
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:54,739
Western doctors had little interest in it.
One of my colleagues-an intelligent man -returned

1111
01:38:54,739 --> 01:39:00,760
the typescript of my pregnancy pamphlet to
me in the fall of 1931 with a red line drawn

1112
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:05,900
through the entire section on the Breathing
Method. In the margin he had scribbled that

1113
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:11,550
if he wanted to know about 'nigger superstitions',
he would stop by a newsstand and buy an issue

1114
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:13,710
of Weird Tales!

1115
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:19,570
Well, I didn't cut the section from the pamphlet
as he had suggested, but I had mixed results

1116
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:24,680
with the method-that was the best one could
say. There were women who used it with great

1117
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:29,810
success. There were others who seemed to grasp
the idea perfectly in principle but who lost

1118
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:35,030
their discipline completely as soon as their
contractions became deep and heavy. In most

1119
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:40,290
of those cases I found that the entire idea
had been subverted and undermined by well-meaning

1120
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:44,219
friends and relatives who had never heard
of such a thing and thus could not believe

1121
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:46,160
it would actually work.

1122
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:52,140
The method was based on the idea that, while
no two labours are ever the same in their

1123
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:57,970
specifics, all are pretty much alike in general.
There are four stages: contractive labour,

1124
01:39:57,970 --> 01:40:03,830
mid-labour, birth, and the expulsion of the
afterbirth. Contractions are a complete hardening

1125
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:08,800
of the abdominal and pelvic-area muscles,
and the expectant mother often finds them

1126
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:14,160
beginning in the sixth month. Many women pregnant
for the first time expect something rather

1127
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,660
nasty, like bowel cramps, but I'm told it's
much cleaner- a strongly physical sensation,

1128
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:25,390
which may deepen into a pain like a charley
horse. A woman employing the Breathing Method

1129
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:30,950
began to breathe in a series of short, measured
inhales and exhales when she felt a contraction

1130
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:37,300
coming on. Each breath was expelled in a puff,
as if one were blowing a trumpet Dizzy Gillespie

1131
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:38,640
fashion.

1132
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:43,320
During mid-labour, when more painful contractions
begin coming every fifteen minutes or so,

1133
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:48,870
the woman switched to long inhales followed
by long exhales-it's the way a marathon runner

1134
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:53,530
breathes when he's starting his final kick.
The harder the contraction, the longer the

1135
01:40:53,530 --> 01:41:00,160
inhale-exhale. In my pamphlet, I called this
stage 'riding the waves'. The final stage

1136
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,200
we need concern ourselves with here I called
'locomotive', and Lamaze instructors today

1137
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:10,160
frequently call it the 'choo-choo' stage of
breathing. Final labour is accompanied by

1138
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:15,810
pains which are most frequently described
as deep and glassy. They are accompanied by

1139
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:21,810
an irresistible urge on the mother's part
to push to expel the baby. This is the point,

1140
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:27,410
gentlemen, at which that wonderful, frightening
engine reaches its absolute crescendo. The

1141
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:32,720
cervix is fully dilated. The baby has begun
its short journey down the birth canal, and

1142
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:37,270
if you were to look directly between the mother's
legs, you would be apt to see the baby's fontanell

1143
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:42,540
pulsing only inches from the open air. The
mother using the Breathing Method now begins

1144
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:49,360
to take and let out short, sharp breaths between
her lips, not filling her lungs, not hyperventilating,

1145
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:54,540
but almost panting in a perfectly controlled
fashion. It really is the sound children make

1146
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:57,830
when they are imitating a steam-driven locomotive.

1147
01:41:57,830 --> 01:42:04,240
All of this has a salutary effect on the body-the
mother's oxygen is kept high without putting

1148
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:10,120
her systems on an emergency basis, and she
herself remains aware and alert, able to ask

1149
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:17,120
and answer questions, able to take instructions.
But of course the mental results of the Breathing

1150
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:22,590
Method were even more important. The mother
felt she was actively participating in the

1151
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:28,550
birth of her child-that she was in some part
guiding the process. She felt on top of the

1152
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:33,090
experience and on top of the pain.

1153
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:36,870
You can understand that the whole process
was utterly dependent on the patient's state

1154
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:42,570
of mind. The Breathing Method was uniquely
vulnerable, uniquely delicate, and if I had

1155
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:47,320
a good many failures, I'd explain them this
way-what a patient can be convinced of by

1156
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:53,460
her doctor she may be unconvinced of by relatives
who raise their hands in horror when told

1157
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:56,530
of such a heathenish practice.

1158
01:42:56,530 --> 01:43:01,489
From this aspect, at least, Miss Stansfield
was the ideal patient She had neither friends

1159
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:05,449
nor relatives to talk her out of her belief
in the Breathing Method (although, in all

1160
01:43:05,449 --> 01:43:09,489
fairness, I must add that I doubt anyone ever
talked her out of anything once she had made

1161
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:15,550
up her mind on the subject) once she came
to believe in it. And she did come to believe

1162
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:20,840
in it 'It's a little like self-hypnosis, isn't
it?' she asked me the first time we really

1163
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:25,510
discussed it I agreed, delighted. 'Exactly!
But you mustn't let that make you think it's

1164
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:29,160
a trick, or that it will let you down when
the going gets tough.'

1165
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:35,640
'I don't think that at all. I'm very grateful
to you. I'll practise assiduously, Dr McCarron.'

1166
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:40,760
She was the sort of woman the Breathing Method
was invented for, and when she told me she

1167
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:46,610
would practise, she spoke nothing but the
truth. I have never seen anyone embrace an

1168
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:51,910
idea with such enthusiasm but, of course,
the Breathing Method was uniquely suited to

1169
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:57,360
her temperament There are docile men and women
in this world by the millions, and some of

1170
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,860
them are damn fine people. But there are others
whose hands ache to hold the throttles of

1171
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:06,760
their own lives, and Miss Stansfield was one
of those.

1172
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:11,199
When I say she embraced the Breathing Method
totally, I mean it and I think the story of

1173
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:15,699
her final day at the department store where
she sold perfumes and cosmetics proves the

1174
01:44:15,699 --> 01:44:22,570
point. The end of her gainful employment finally
came late in August. Miss Stansfield was a

1175
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:27,650
slim young woman in fine physical condition,
and this was, of course, her first child.

1176
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:32,660
Any doctor will tell you that such a woman
is apt not to 'show' for five, perhaps even

1177
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:38,440
six months and then, one day and all at once,
everything will show.

1178
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:42,450
She came in for her monthly checkup on the
first of September, laughed ruefully, and

1179
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:45,510
told me she had discovered the Breathing Method
had another use.

1180
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:48,060
'What's that?' I asked her.

1181
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:52,480
'It's even better than counting to ten when
you're mad as hell at someone,' she said.

1182
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:58,010
Those hazel eyes were dancing. 'Although people
look at you as if you might be a lunatic when

1183
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,930
you start puffing and blowing.'

1184
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:05,360
She told me the tale readily enough. She had
gone to work as usual on the previous Monday,

1185
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:10,420
and all I can think is that the curiously
abrupt transition from a slim young woman

1186
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:15,710
to an obviously pregnant young woman-and the
transition really can be almost as sudden

1187
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:21,480
as day to dark in the tropics -had happened
to her over the weekend. Or maybe her supervisor

1188
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:26,730
finally decided that her suspicions were no
longer just suspicions.

1189
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:34,920
'I'll want to see you in the office on your
break,' this woman, a Mrs Kelly, said coldly.

1190
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,890
She had previously been quite friendly to
Miss Stansfield. She had shown her pictures

1191
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:43,989
of her two children, both in high school,
and they had exchanged recipes at one point.

1192
01:45:43,989 --> 01:45:49,090
Mrs Kelly was always asking her if she had
met 'a nice boy' yet. That kindliness and

1193
01:45:49,090 --> 01:45:54,710
friendliness was gone now. And when she stepped
into Mrs Kelly's office on her break, Miss

1194
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:58,020
Stansfield told me, she knew what to expect.

1195
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,210
'You're in trouble,' this previously kind
woman said curtly.

1196
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:06,930
'Yes,' Miss Stansfield said. 'It's called
that by some people.'

1197
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:11,300
Mrs Kelly's cheeks had gone the colour of
old brick. 'Don't you be smart with me, young

1198
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:16,520
woman,' she said. 'From the looks of your
belly, you've been too smart by half already.'

1199
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:21,180
I could see the two of them in my mind's eye
as she told me the story-Miss Stansfield,

1200
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:26,740
her direct hazel eyes fixed on Mrs Kelly,
perfectly composed, refusing to drop her eyes,

1201
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:32,980
or weep, or exhibit shame in any other way.
I believe she had a much more practical conception

1202
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:38,130
of the trouble she was in than her supervisor
did, with her two almost grown children and

1203
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:42,350
her respectable husband, who owned his own
barbershop and voted Republican.

1204
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:47,961
'I must say you show remarkably little shame
at the way you've deceived me!' Mrs Kelly

1205
01:46:47,961 --> 01:46:49,330
burst out bitterly.

1206
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:55,030
'I have never deceived you. No mention of
my pregnancy has been made until today.' She

1207
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:58,949
looked at Mrs Kelly almost curiously. 'How
can you say I have deceived you?'

1208
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:06,360
'I took you home!' Mrs Kelly cried. 'I had
you to dinner with my sons.' She looked at

1209
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,220
Miss Stansfield with utter loathing.

1210
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:14,600
This is when Miss Stansfield began to grow
angry. Angrier, she told me, than she had

1211
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:19,970
ever been in her life. She had not been unaware
of the sort of reaction she could expect when

1212
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:24,870
the secret came out, but as any one of you
gentlemen will attest, the difference between

1213
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:30,980
academic theory and practical application
can sometimes be shockingly huge.

1214
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:35,730
Clutching her hands firmly together in her
lap, Miss Stansfield said: 'If you are suggesting

1215
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:42,080
I made or ever would make any attempt to seduce
your sons, that's the dirtiest, filthiest

1216
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,780
thing I've ever heard in my life.'

1217
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:50,290
Mrs Kelly's head rocked back as if she had
been slapped. That bricky colour drained from

1218
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:55,450
her cheeks, leaving only two small spots of
hectic colour. The two women looked grimly

1219
01:47:55,450 --> 01:48:00,320
at each other across a desk littered with
perfume samples in a room that smelled vaguely

1220
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:06,080
of flowers. It was a moment, Miss Stansfield
said, that seemed much longer than it actually

1221
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,640
could have been.

1222
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:11,739
Then Mrs Kelly yanked open one of her drawers
and brought out a buff-coloured cheque.

1223
01:48:11,739 --> 01:48:16,940
A bright pink severance slip was attached
to it. Showing her teeth, actually seeming

1224
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:23,440
to bite off each word, she said, 'With hundreds
of decent girls looking for work in this city,

1225
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:29,260
I hardly think we need a strumpet such as
yourself in our employ, dear.'

1226
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:35,030
She told me it was that final, contemptuous
'dear' that brought all her anger to a sudden

1227
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:39,880
head. A moment later Mrs Kelly's jaw dropped
and her eyes widened as Miss Stansfield, her

1228
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:44,090
hands locked together as tightly as links
in a steel chain, so tightly she left bruises

1229
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:49,050
on herself (they were fading but still perfectly
visible when I saw her on 1 September), began

1230
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,460
to 'locomotive' between her clenched teeth.

1231
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:57,461
It wasn't a funny story, perhaps, but I burst
out laughing at the image and Miss Stansfield

1232
01:48:57,461 --> 01:49:02,610
joined me. Mrs Davidson looked in-to make
sure we hadn't gotten into the nitrous oxide,

1233
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:03,790
perhaps-and then left again.

1234
01:49:03,790 --> 01:49:09,510
'It was all I could think to do,' Miss Stansfield
said, still laughing and wiping her streaming

1235
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:14,780
eyes with her handkerchief. 'Because at that
moment, I saw myself reaching out and simply

1236
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:20,080
sweeping those sample bottles of perfume-every
one of them-off her desk and onto the floor,

1237
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:26,320
which was uncarpeted concrete. I didn't just
think it, I saw it! I saw them crashing to

1238
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,270
the floor and filling the room with such a
God-awful mixed stench that the fumigators

1239
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:32,270
would have to come.

1240
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:38,090
'I was going to do it; nothing was going to
stop me doing it. Then I began to Breathe,

1241
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:41,770
and everything was all right. I was able to
take the cheque, and the pink slip, and get

1242
01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:46,310
up, and get out. I wasn't able to thank her,
of course- I was still being a locomotive"

1243
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:50,090
We laughed again, and then she sobered.

1244
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:55,870
'It's all passed off now, and I am even able
to feel a little sorry for her-or does that

1245
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:58,030
sound like a terribly stiff-necked thing to
say?'

1246
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:02,020
'Not at all. I think it's an admirable way
to be able to feel.'

1247
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:05,630
'May I show you something I bought with my
severance pay, Dr McCarron?'

1248
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,929
'Yes, if you like.'

1249
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:13,020
She opened her purse and took out a small
flat box. 'I bought it at a pawnshop,' she

1250
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,020
said.

1251
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:17,680
'For two dollars. And it's the only time during
this whole nightmare that I've felt ashamed

1252
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,340
and dirty. Isn't that strange?'

1253
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:25,390
She opened the box and laid it on my desk
so I could look inside. I wasn't surprised

1254
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:29,330
at what I saw. It was a plain gold wedding
ring.

1255
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:34,620
'I'll do what's necessary,' she said. 'I am
staying in what Mrs Kelly would undoubtedly

1256
01:50:34,620 --> 01:50:41,080
call "a respectable boarding house". My landlady
has been kind and friendly but Mrs Kelly was

1257
01:50:41,080 --> 01:50:45,660
kind and friendly, too. I think she may ask
me to leave at any time now, and I suspect

1258
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:49,490
that if I say anything about the rent-balance
due me, or the damage deposit I paid when

1259
01:50:49,490 --> 01:50:51,310
I moved in, she'll laugh in my face.'

1260
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:57,430
'My dear young woman, that would be quite
illegal. There are courts and lawyers to help

1261
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:58,449
you answer such -'

1262
01:50:58,449 --> 01:51:04,179
The courts are men's clubs,' she said steadily,
'and not apt to go out of their way to befriend

1263
01:51:04,179 --> 01:51:08,570
a woman in my position. Perhaps I could get
my money back, perhaps not.

1264
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:14,080
Either way, the expense and the trouble and
the the unpleasantness hardly seem worth the

1265
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:18,550
forty-seven dollars or so. I had no business
mentioning it to you in the first place. It

1266
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:22,590
hasn't happened yet, and maybe it won't. But
in any case, I intend to be practical from

1267
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:23,699
now on.'

1268
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:27,230
She raised her head, and her eyes flashed
at mine.

1269
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:32,050
'I've got my eye on a place down in the Village-just
in case. It's on the third floor, but it's

1270
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:36,040
clean, and it's five dollars a month cheaper
than where I'm staying now.' She picked the

1271
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,719
ring out of the box. 'I wore this when the
landlady showed me the room.'

1272
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,540
She put it on the third finger of her left
hand with a small moue of disgust of which

1273
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:50,630
I believe she was unaware. There. Now I'm
Mrs Stansfield. My husband was a truck-driver

1274
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:55,970
who was killed on the Pittsburgh-New York
run. Very sad. But I am no longer a little

1275
01:51:55,970 --> 01:52:00,560
roundheels strumpet, and my child is no longer
a bastard.'

1276
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,570
She looked up at me, and the tears were in
her eyes again. As I watched, one of them

1277
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:08,860
overspilled and rolled down her cheek.

1278
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:14,441
'Please,' I said, distressed, and reached
across the desk to take her hand. It was very,

1279
01:52:14,441 --> 01:52:17,360
very cold. 'Don't, my dear.'

1280
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:23,780
She turned her hand-it was the left-over in
my hand and looked at the ring. She smiled,

1281
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:30,420
and that smile was as bitter as gall and vinegar,
gentlemen. Another tear fell-just that one.

1282
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:37,000
'When I hear cynics say that the days of magic
and miracles are all behind us, Dr McCarron,

1283
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:43,030
I'll know they're deluded, won't I? When you
can buy a ring in a pawnshop for a dollar

1284
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:48,410
and a half and that ring will instantly erase
both bastardy and licentiousness, what else

1285
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:53,730
would you call that but magic? Cheap magic.'

1286
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:59,510
'Miss Stansfield Sandra, if I may if you need
help, if there's anything I can do -'

1287
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:04,219
She drew her hand away from me-if I had taken
her right hand instead of her left, perhaps

1288
01:53:04,219 --> 01:53:09,890
she would not have done. I did not love her,
I've told you, but in that moment I could

1289
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:15,780
have loved her; I was on the verge of falling
in love with her. Perhaps, if I'd taken her

1290
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:20,390
right hand instead of the one with that lying
ring on it, and if she had allowed me to hold

1291
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:25,949
her hand only a little longer, until my own
warmed it, perhaps then I should have.

1292
01:53:25,949 --> 01:53:33,390
'You're a good, kind man, and you've done
a great deal for me and my baby and your Breathing

1293
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:38,570
Method is a much better kind of magic than
this awful ring. After all, it kept me from

1294
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:43,199
being jailed on charges of wilful destruction,
didn't it?'

1295
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:48,171
She left soon after that, and I went to the
window to watch her move off down the street

1296
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:54,770
towards Madison Avenue. God, I admired her
just then: She looked so slight, so young,

1297
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:59,820
and so obviously pregnant-but there was still
nothing timid or tentative about her. She

1298
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:04,910
did not scutter up the street; she walked
as if she had every right to her place on

1299
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:06,800
the sidewalk.

1300
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:12,719
She left my view and I turned back to my desk.
As I did so, the framed photograph which hung

1301
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:18,929
on the wall next to my diploma caught my eye,
and a terrible shudder worked through me.

1302
01:54:18,929 --> 01:54:25,719
My skin-all of it, even the skin on my forehead
and the backs of my hands-crawled up into

1303
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:32,960
cold knots of gooseflesh. The most suffocating
fear of my entire life fell on me like a horrible

1304
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:40,060
shroud, and I found myself gasping for breath.
It was a precognitive interlude, gentlemen.

1305
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:47,130
I do not take part in arguments about whether
or not such things can occur; I know they

1306
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:54,560
can, because it has happened to me. Just that
once, on that hot early September afternoon.

1307
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,850
I pray to God I never have another.

1308
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:04,250
The photograph had been taken by my mother
on the day I finished medical school. It showed

1309
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:09,920
me standing in front of White Memorial, hands
behind my back, grinning like a kid who's

1310
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:16,090
just gotten a full-day pass to the rides at
Palisades Park. To my left the statue of Harriet

1311
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:21,930
White can be seen, and although the photograph
cuts her off at about mid-shin, the pedestal

1312
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:28,300
and that queerly heartless inscription-There
is no comfort without pain; thus we define

1313
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:35,719
salvation through suffering-could be clearly
seen. It was at the foot of the statue of

1314
01:55:35,719 --> 01:55:42,969
my grandfather's first wife, directly below
that inscription, that Sandra Stansfield died

1315
01:55:42,969 --> 01:55:49,010
not quite four months later in a senseless
accident that occurred just as she arrived

1316
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:53,420
at the hospital to deliver her child.

1317
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:58,130
She exhibited some anxiety that fall that
I would not be there to attend her during

1318
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:03,960
her labour-that I would be away for the Christmas
holidays or not on call. She was partly afraid

1319
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:09,370
that she would be delivered by some doctor
who would ignore her wish to use the Breathing

1320
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:15,590
Method and who would instead give her gas
or a spinal block. I assured her as best I

1321
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:20,890
could. I had no reason to leave the city,
no family to visit over the holidays. My mother

1322
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:26,150
had died two years before, and there was no
one else except a maiden aunt in California

1323
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:32,300
and the train didn't agree with me, I told
Miss Stansfield. 'Are you ever lonely?' she

1324
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,850
asked.

1325
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:40,110
'Sometimes. Usually I keep too busy. Now,
take this.' I jotted my home telephone number

1326
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:45,010
on a card and gave it to her. 'If you get
the answering service when your labour begins,

1327
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:46,010
call me here.'

1328
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,800
'Oh, no, I couldn't-'

1329
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:52,020
'Do you want to use the Breathing Method,
or do you want to get some sawbones who'll

1330
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:57,060
think you're mad and give you a capful of
ether as soon as you start to "locomotive"?'

1331
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:00,100
She smiled a little. 'All right. I'm convinced.'

1332
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:06,250
But as the autumn progressed and the butchers
on 3rd Avenue began advertising the per-pound

1333
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:11,850
price of their 'young and succulent Toms',
it became clear that her mind was still not

1334
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:16,290
at rest She had indeed been asked to leave
the place where she had been living when I

1335
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:20,469
first met her, and had moved to the Village.
But that, at least, had turned out quite well

1336
01:57:20,469 --> 01:57:25,630
for her. She had even found work of a sort.
A blind woman with a fairly comfortable income

1337
01:57:25,630 --> 01:57:28,580
had hired her to come in twice a week, do
some light housework, and then to read to

1338
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:38,250
her from the works of Jean Stratton-Porter
and Pearl Buck. She had taken on that blooming,

1339
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:44,070
rosy look that most healthy women come to
have during the final trimester of their pregnancies.

1340
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:50,000
But there was a shadow on her face. I would
speak to her and she would be slow to answer

1341
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,610
and once, when she didn't answer at all, I
looked up from the notes I was making and

1342
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:59,320
saw her looking at the framed photograph next
to my diploma with a strange, dreamy expression

1343
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:06,220
in her eyes. I felt a recurrence of that chill
and her response, which had nothing to do

1344
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:12,449
with my question, hardly made me feel easier.
'I have a feeling, Dr McCarron, sometimes

1345
01:58:12,449 --> 01:58:21,290
quite a strong feeling, that I am doomed.'
Silly, melodramatic word! And yet, gentlemen,

1346
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:27,210
the response that rose to my own lips was
this: Yes; I feel that, too. I bit it off,

1347
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:31,290
of course; a doctor who would say such a thing
should immediately put his instruments and

1348
01:58:31,290 --> 01:58:36,900
medical books up for sale and investigate
his future in the plumbing or carpentry business.

1349
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:41,199
I told her that she was not the first pregnant
woman to have such feelings, and would not

1350
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:46,520
be the last. I told her that the feeling was
indeed so common that doctors knew it by the

1351
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:51,810
tongue-in-cheek name of The Valley of the
Shadow Syndrome. I've already mentioned it

1352
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:53,490
tonight, I believe.

1353
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:58,790
Miss Stansfield nodded with perfect seriousness,
and I remember how young she looked that day,

1354
01:58:58,790 --> 01:59:03,940
and how large her belly seemed. 'I know about
that,' she said. 'I've felt it. But it's quite

1355
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:09,930
separate from this other feeling. This other
feeling is like like something looming up.

1356
01:59:09,930 --> 01:59:13,840
I can't describe it any better than that.
It's silly, but I can't shake it.'

1357
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,080
'You must try,' I said. 'It isn't good for
the -'

1358
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:22,660
But she had drifted away from me. She was
looking at the photograph again. 'Who is that?'

1359
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:28,550
'Emlyn McCarron,' I said, trying to make a
joke. It sounded extraordinarily feeble. 'Back

1360
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:30,650
before the Civil War, when he was quite young.'

1361
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:38,380
'No, I recognized you, of course,' she said.
"The woman. Who is the woman?'

1362
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:45,679
'Her name is Harriet White,' I said, and thought:
And hers will be the first face you see when

1363
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:52,170
you arrive to deliver your child. The chill
came back-that dreadful drifting formless

1364
01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:55,470
chill. Her stone face.

1365
01:59:55,470 --> 02:00:01,739
'And what does it say there at the base of
the statue?' she asked, her eyes still dreamy,

1366
02:00:01,739 --> 02:00:03,060
almost trancelike.

1367
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:10,489
'I don't know,' I lied. 'My conversational
Latin is not that good.'

1368
02:00:10,489 --> 02:00:18,130
That night I had the worst dream of my entire
life -I woke up from it in utter terror, and

1369
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:23,640
if I had been married, I suppose I would have
frightened my poor wife to death.

1370
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:30,050
In the dream I opened the door to my consulting
room and found Sandra Stansfield in there.

1371
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:35,120
She was wearing the brown pumps, the smart
white linen dress with the brown edging, and

1372
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:40,910
the slightly out-of-date cloche hat. But the
hat was between her breasts, because she was

1373
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:48,480
carrying her head in her arms. The white linen
was stained and streaked with gore. Blood

1374
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:51,970
jetted from her neck and splattered the ceiling.

1375
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:57,540
And then her eyes fluttered open-those wonderful
hazel eyes-and they fixed on mine.

1376
02:00:57,540 --> 02:01:05,520
'Doomed,' the speaking head told me. 'Doomed.
I'm doomed. There's no salvation without suffering.

1377
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,960
It's cheap magic, but it's all we have.'

1378
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:17,770
That's when I woke up screaming: Her due date
of 10 December came and went. I examined her

1379
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:24,000
on 17 December and suggested that, while the
baby would almost certainly be born in 1935,

1380
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:30,120
I no longer expected the child to put in his
or her appearance until after Christmas. Miss

1381
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:35,060
Stansfield accepted this with good grace.
She seemed to have thrown off the shadow that

1382
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:39,760
had hung over her that fall. Mrs Gibbs, the
blind woman who had hired her to read aloud

1383
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:44,920
and do light housework, was impressed with
her-impressed enough to tell her friends about

1384
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:49,540
the brave young widow who, in spite of her
recent bereavement and delicate condition,

1385
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:55,100
was facing her own future with such determined
good cheer. Several of the blind woman's friends

1386
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:59,050
had expressed an interest in employing her
following the birth of her child.

1387
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:04,160
'I'll take them up on it, too,' she told me.
'For the baby. But only until I'm on my feet

1388
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:09,330
again, and able to find something steady.
Sometimes I think the worst part of this -of

1389
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:14,600
everything that's happened-is that it's changed
the way I look at people. Sometimes I think

1390
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:20,400
to myself, "How can you sleep at night, knowing
that you've deceived that dear old thing?"

1391
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:25,860
and then I think, "If she knew, she'd show
you the door, just like all the others."

1392
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:30,510
Either way, it's a lie, and I feel the weight
of it on my heart sometimes.'

1393
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:37,320
Before she left that day, she took a small,
gaily wrapped package from her purse and slid

1394
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:41,820
it shyly across the desk to me. 'Merry Christmas,
Dr McCarron.'

1395
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:48,520
'You shouldn't have,' I said, sliding open
a drawer and taking out a package of my own.

1396
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:51,449
'But since I did, too -'

1397
02:02:51,449 --> 02:02:57,040
She looked at me for a moment, surprised and
then we laughed together. She had gotten me

1398
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:02,740
a silver tie-clasp with the medical symbol
on it. I had gotten her an album in which

1399
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:11,320
to keep photographs of her baby. I still have
the tie-clasp. What happened to the album,

1400
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:12,640
I cannot say.

1401
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:17,890
I saw her to the door, and as we reached it,
she turned to me, put her hands on my shoulders,

1402
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:23,910
stood on tiptoe, and kissed me on the mouth.
Her lips were cool and firm. It was not a

1403
02:03:23,910 --> 02:03:28,410
passionate kiss, gentlemen, but neither was
it the sort of kiss you might expect from

1404
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:30,250
a sister or an aunt.

1405
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:35,270
'Thank you again, Dr McCarron,' she said a
little breathlessly. The colour was high in

1406
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:40,670
her cheeks and her hazel eyes glowed lustrously.
'Thank you for so much.'

1407
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:47,120
I laughed-a little uneasily. 'You speak as
if we'll never meet again, Sandra.' It was,

1408
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:51,440
I believe, the second and last time I ever
used her Christian name.

1409
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:55,790
'Oh, we'll meet again,' she said. 'I don't
doubt it a bit.'

1410
02:03:55,790 --> 02:04:01,550
And she was right-although neither of us could
have foreseen the dreadful cricumstances of

1411
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:04,699
that last meeting.

1412
02:04:04,699 --> 02:04:09,560
Sandra Stansfield's labour began on Christmas
Eve, at just past six p. m. By that time,

1413
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:14,660
the snow which had fallen all that day had
changed to sleet. And by the time Miss Stansfield

1414
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:19,350
entered mid-labour, not quite two hours later,
the city streets were a dangerous glaze of

1415
02:04:19,350 --> 02:04:20,820
ice.

1416
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:26,350
Mrs Gibbs, the blind woman, had a large and
spacious first-floor apartment, and at 6:30

1417
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:31,740
p. m. Miss Stansfield worked her way carefully
downstairs, knocked at her door, was admitted,

1418
02:04:31,740 --> 02:04:35,400
and asked if she might use the telephone to
call a cab.

1419
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:38,980
'Is it the baby, dear?' Mrs Gibbs asked, fluttering
already.

1420
02:04:38,980 --> 02:04:43,270
'Yes. The labour's only begun, but I can't
chance the weather. It will take a cab a long

1421
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:44,270
time.'

1422
02:04:44,270 --> 02:04:49,140
She made that call and then called me. At
that time, 6:40, the pains were coming at

1423
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:53,679
intervals of about twenty-five minutes. She
repeated to me that she had begun everything

1424
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:58,409
early because of the foul weather. 'I'd rather
not have my child in the back of a Yellow,'

1425
02:04:58,409 --> 02:05:01,160
she said. She sounded extraordinarily calm.

1426
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:06,659
The cab was late and Miss Stansfield's labour
was progressing more rapidly than I would

1427
02:05:06,659 --> 02:05:11,929
have predicted-but as I have said, no two
labours are alike in their specifics. The

1428
02:05:11,929 --> 02:05:15,949
driver, seeing that his fare was about to
have a baby, helped her down the slick steps,

1429
02:05:15,949 --> 02:05:21,580
constantly adjuring her to 'be careful, lady'.
Miss Stansfield only nodded, preoccupied with

1430
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:27,640
her deep inhale-exhales as a fresh contraction
seized her. Sleet ticked off streetlights

1431
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:33,530
and the roofs of cars; it melted in large,
magnifying drops on the taxi's yellow dome-light.

1432
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:39,070
Miss Gibbs told me later that the young cab
driver was more nervous than her 'poor, dear

1433
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:44,080
Sandra', and that was probably a contributing
cause to the accident.

1434
02:05:44,080 --> 02:05:48,240
Another was almost certainly the Breathing
Method itself.

1435
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:55,560
The driver threaded his hack through the slippery
streets, working his way slowly past the fender-benders

1436
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:01,150
and inching through the clogged intersections,
slowly closing on the hospital. He was not

1437
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:05,240
seriously injured in the accident, and I talked
to him in the hospital.

1438
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:10,850
He said the sound of the steady deep breathing
coming from the back seat made him nervous;

1439
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:16,219
he kept looking in the rear view mirror to
see if she was 'dine or sumpin'. He said he

1440
02:06:16,219 --> 02:06:20,410
would have felt less nervous if she had let
out a few healthy bellows, the way a woman

1441
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:25,150
in labour was supposed to do. He asked her
once or twice if she was feeling all right

1442
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:30,560
and she only nodded, continuing to 'ride the
waves' in deep inhales and exhales.

1443
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,590
Two or three blocks from the hospital, she
must have felt the onset of labour's final

1444
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:36,679
stage.

1445
02:06:36,679 --> 02:06:41,890
An hour had passed since she had entered the
cab-the traffic was that snarled-but this

1446
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:47,230
was still an extraordinarily fast labour for
a woman having her first baby. The driver

1447
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:53,210
noticed the change in the way she was breathing.
'She started pantin' like a dog on a hot day,

1448
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:56,660
Doc,' he told me. She had begun to 'locomotive'.

1449
02:06:56,660 --> 02:07:00,950
At almost the same time the cabbie saw a hole
open up in the crawling cross-traffic and

1450
02:07:00,950 --> 02:07:05,679
shot through it The way to White Memorial
was now open. It was less than three blocks

1451
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:11,700
ahead. 'I could see the statue of that broad,'
he said. Eager to be rid of his panting, pregnant

1452
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:16,130
passenger, he stepped down on the gas again
and the cab leaped forward, wheels spinning

1453
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,840
over the ice with little or no traction.

1454
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:23,980
I had walked to the hospital, and my arrival
coincided with the cab's arrival only because

1455
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:28,890
I had underestimated just how bad driving
conditions had become. I believed I would

1456
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:35,390
find her upstairs, a legally admitted patient
with all her papers signed, her prep completed,

1457
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:40,679
working her way steadily through her mid-labour.
I was mounting the steps when I saw the sudden

1458
02:07:40,679 --> 02:07:45,200
sharp convergence of two sets of headlights
reflected from the patch of ice where the

1459
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:51,780
janitors hadn't yet spread cinders. I turned
just in time to see it happen.

1460
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:57,280
An ambulance was nosing its way out of the
Emergency Wing rampway as Miss Stansfield's

1461
02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:02,380
cab came across the Square and towards the
hospital. The cab was simply going too fast

1462
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:07,860
to stop. The cabbie panicked and stamped down
on the brake-pedal rather than pumping it.

1463
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:13,310
The cab slid, then began to turn broadside.
The pulsing dome-light of the ambulance threw

1464
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:18,920
moving stripes and blotches of blood-coloured
light over the scene, and, freakishly, one

1465
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:24,989
of these illuminated the face of Sandra Stansfield.
For that one moment it was the face in my

1466
02:08:24,989 --> 02:08:30,320
dream, the same bloody, open-eyed face that
I had seen on her severed head.

1467
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:35,480
I cried out her name, took two steps down,
slipped, and fell sprawling. I cracked my

1468
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:40,800
elbow a paralyzing blow but somehow managed
to hold on to my black bag. I saw the rest

1469
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:46,750
of what happened from where I lay, head ringing,
elbow smarting. The ambulance braked, and

1470
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:52,320
it also began to fishtail. Its rear end struck
the base of the statue. The loading doors

1471
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:57,650
flew open. A stretcher, mercifully empty,
shot out like a tongue and then crashed upside

1472
02:08:57,650 --> 02:09:03,500
down in the street with its wheels spinning.
A young woman on the sidewalk screamed as

1473
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:06,860
the two vehicles approached each other and
tried to run. Her feet went out from under

1474
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:11,480
her after two strides and she fell on her
stomach. Her purse flew out of her hand and

1475
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:17,870
shot down the icy sidewalk like a weight in
a pinball bowling game. The cab swung all

1476
02:09:17,870 --> 02:09:22,140
the way around, now travelling backwards,
and I could see the cabbie clearly. He was

1477
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:27,720
spinning his wheel madly, like a kid in a
Dodgem Car. The ambulance rebounded from Mrs

1478
02:09:27,720 --> 02:09:33,520
White's statue at an angle and smashed broadside
into the cab. The taxi spun around once in

1479
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:38,680
a tight circle and was slammed against the
base of the statue with fearful force. Its

1480
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:44,960
yellow light, the letters ON RADIO CALL still
flashing, exploded like a bomb. The left side

1481
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,949
of the cab crumpled like tissue-paper. A moment
later I saw that it was not just the left

1482
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:55,590
side; the cab had struck an angle of the pedestal
hard enough to tear it in two. Glass sprayed

1483
02:09:55,590 --> 02:10:00,700
onto the slick ice like diamonds. And my patient
was thrown through the rear right-side window

1484
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:06,120
of the dismembered cab like a rag-doll. I
was on my feet again without even knowing

1485
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:11,239
it. I raced down the icy steps, slipped again,
caught at the railing, and kept on. I was

1486
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:16,570
only aware of Miss Stansfield lying in the
uncertain shadow cast by that hideous statue

1487
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:21,140
of Harriet White, some twenty feet from where
the ambulance had come to rest on its side,

1488
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:26,010
flasher still strobing the night with red.
There was something terribly wrong with that

1489
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:30,070
figure, but I honestly don't believe I knew
what it was until my foot struck something

1490
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:34,890
with a heavy enough thud to almost send me
sprawling again. The thing I'd kicked skittered

1491
02:10:34,890 --> 02:10:39,640
away-like the young woman's purse, it slid
rather than rolled. It skittered away and

1492
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:45,699
it was only the fall of hair-bloodstreaked
but still recognizably blonde, speckled with

1493
02:10:45,699 --> 02:10:51,860
bits of glass-that made me realize what it
was. She had been decapitated in the accident.

1494
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:58,720
What I had kicked into the frozen gutter was
her head.

1495
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:05,140
Moving in total numb shock, now I reached
her body and turned it over. I think I tried

1496
02:11:05,140 --> 02:11:11,870
to scream as soon as I had done it, as soon
as I saw. If I did, no sound came out; I could

1497
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:20,219
not make a sound. The woman was still breathing,
you see, gentlemen. Her chest was heaving

1498
02:11:20,219 --> 02:11:26,199
up and down in quick, light, shallow breaths.
Ice pattered down on her open coat and her

1499
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:32,489
blood-drenched dress. And I could hear a high,
thin whistling noise. It waxed and waned like

1500
02:11:32,489 --> 02:11:38,820
a teakettle which can't quite reach the boil.
It was air being pulled into her severed windpipe

1501
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:44,680
and then exhaled again; the little screams
of air through the crude reed of the vocal

1502
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:51,430
chords which no longer had a mouth to shape
their sounds. I wanted to run but I had no

1503
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:57,230
strength; I fell on my knees beside her on
the ice, one hand cupped to my mouth. A moment

1504
02:11:57,230 --> 02:12:02,860
later I was aware of fresh blood seeping through
the lower part of her dress-and of movement

1505
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:09,530
there. I became suddenly, frenziedly convinced
that there was still a chance to save the

1506
02:12:09,530 --> 02:12:10,530
baby.

1507
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:14,030
'Cheap magic!' I roared into the sleet, and
I believe that as I yanked her dress up to

1508
02:12:14,030 --> 02:12:24,640
her waist I began laughing. I believe I was
mad. Her body was warm. I remember that. I

1509
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:29,430
remember the way it heaved with her breathing.
One of the ambulance attendants came up, weaving

1510
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:35,150
like a drunk, one hand clapped to the side
of his head. Blood trickled through his fingers.

1511
02:12:35,150 --> 02:12:40,670
'Cheap magic!' I screamed again, still laughing,
still groping. My hands had found her fully

1512
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:41,710
dilated.

1513
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:47,570
The attendant stared down at Sandra Stansfield's
headless body with wide eyes. I don't know

1514
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:51,390
if he realized the corpse was still somehow
breathing or not Perhaps he thought it was

1515
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:56,990
merely a thing of the nerves- a kind of final
reflex action. If he did think such a thing,

1516
02:12:56,990 --> 02:13:01,770
he could not have been driving an ambulance
long. Chickens may walk around for a while

1517
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:08,929
with their heads cut off, but people only
twitch once or twice if that 'Stop staring

1518
02:13:08,929 --> 02:13:11,510
at her and get me a blanket,' I snapped at
him.

1519
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:16,270
He wandered away, but not back towards the
ambulance. He was pointed more or less towards

1520
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:21,960
Times Square. He simply walked off into the
sleety night. I have no idea what became of

1521
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:27,570
him. I turned back to the dead woman who was
somehow not dead, hesitated a moment, and

1522
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:32,920
then stripped off my overcoat. Then I lifted
her hips so I could get it under her. Still

1523
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:39,030
I heard that whistle of breath as her headless
body did 'locomotive' breathing. I sometimes

1524
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:44,180
hear it still, gentlemen. In my dreams.

1525
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:49,570
Please understand that all of this had happened
in an extremely short time-it seemed longer

1526
02:13:49,570 --> 02:13:54,250
to me, but only because my perceptions had
been heightened to a feverish pitch. People

1527
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:58,510
were only beginning to run out of the hospital
to see what had happened, and behind me a

1528
02:13:58,510 --> 02:14:04,530
woman shrieked as she saw the severed head
lying by the edge of the street. I yanked

1529
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:09,620
open my black bag, thanking God I hadn't lost
it in my fall, and pulled out a short scalpel.

1530
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:14,929
I opened it, cut through her underwear, and
pulled it off. Now the ambulance driver approached-he

1531
02:14:14,929 --> 02:14:19,560
came to within fifteen feet of us and then
stopped dead. I glanced over at him, still

1532
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:24,260
wanting that blanket. I wasn't going to get
it from him, I saw; he was staring down at

1533
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:29,239
the breathing body, his eyes widening until
it seemed they must slip from their orbits

1534
02:14:29,239 --> 02:14:34,770
and simply dangle from their optic nerves
like grotesque seeing yo-yos. Then he dropped

1535
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:40,020
to his knees and raised his clasped hands.
He meant to pray, I am quite sure of that.

1536
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:45,290
The attendant might not have known he was
seeing an impossibility, but this fellow did.

1537
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:51,070
The next moment he had fainted dead away.
I had packed forceps in my bag that night;

1538
02:14:51,070 --> 02:14:56,250
I don't know why. I hadn't used such things
in three years, not since I had seen a doctor

1539
02:14:56,250 --> 02:15:00,910
I will not name punch through a newborn's
temple and into the child's brain with one

1540
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:07,610
of those infernal gadgets. The child died
instantly. The corpse was 'lost' and what

1541
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:14,340
went on the death certificate was stillborn.
But, for whatever reason, I had them.

1542
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:20,140
Miss Stansfield's body tightened down, her
belly clenching, turning from flesh to stone.

1543
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:26,050
And the baby crowned. I saw the crown for
just a moment, bloody and membranous and pulsing.

1544
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:29,989
Pulsing. It was alive, at least then. Definitely
alive.

1545
02:15:29,989 --> 02:15:34,770
Stone became flesh again. The crown slipped
back out of sight. And a voice behind me said:

1546
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:36,409
'What can I do, Doctor?'

1547
02:15:36,409 --> 02:15:41,400
It was a middle-aged nurse, the sort of woman
who is so often the backbone of our profession.

1548
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:46,350
Her face was as pale as milk, and while there
was terror and a kind of superstitious awe

1549
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:52,100
on her face as she looked down at that weirdly
breathing body, there was none of that dazed

1550
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:55,550
shock which would have made her difficult
and dangerous to work with.

1551
02:15:55,550 --> 02:16:00,681
'You can get me a blanket, stat,' I said curtly.
'We've still got a chance, I think.' Behind

1552
02:16:00,681 --> 02:16:05,060
her I saw perhaps two dozen people from the
hospital standing on the steps, not wanting

1553
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:10,429
to come any closer. How much or how little
did they see? I have no way of knowing for

1554
02:16:10,429 --> 02:16:15,780
sure. All I know is that I was avoided for
days afterwards (and forever by some of them),

1555
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:20,780
and no one, including this nurse, ever spoke
to me of it. She now turned and started back

1556
02:16:20,780 --> 02:16:21,780
towards the hospital.

1557
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:25,950
'Nurse!' I called. 'No time for that. Get
one from the ambulance. This baby is coming

1558
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:27,199
now.'

1559
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:32,309
She changed course, slipping and sliding through
the slush in her white crepe-soled shoes.

1560
02:16:32,309 --> 02:16:35,269
I turned back to Miss Stansfield.

1561
02:16:35,269 --> 02:16:40,960
Rather than slowing down, the locomotive breathing
had actually begun to speed up and then her

1562
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:46,380
body turned hard again, locked and straining.
The baby crowned again. I waited for it to

1563
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:51,840
slip back but it did not; it simply kept coming.
There was no need for the forceps after all.

1564
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:57,809
The baby all but flew into my hands. I saw
the sleet ticking off its naked, bloody body-for

1565
02:16:57,809 --> 02:17:04,020
it was a boy, his sex unmistakable. I saw
steam rising from it as the black, icy night

1566
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:10,200
snatched away the last of its mother's heat.
Its blood-grimed fists waved feebly; it uttered

1567
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,130
a thin, wailing cry.

1568
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:17,920
'Nurse!' I bawled, 'move your ass, you bitch!'
It was perhaps inexcusable language, but for

1569
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:22,630
a moment I felt I was back in France, that
in a few moments the shells would begin to

1570
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:28,510
whistle overhead with a sound like that remorselessly
ticking sleet; the machine-guns would begin

1571
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:33,849
their hellish stutter; the Germans would begin
to materialize out of the murk, running and

1572
02:17:33,849 --> 02:17:39,810
slipping and cursing and dying in the mud
and smoke. Cheap magic, I thought, seeing

1573
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:46,170
the bodies twist and turn and fall. But you're
right, Sandra, it's all we have. It was the

1574
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:51,310
closest I have ever come to losing my mind,
gentlemen.

1575
02:17:51,310 --> 02:17:54,260
'NURSE, FOR GOD'S SAKE!'

1576
02:17:54,260 --> 02:18:01,790
The baby wailed again-such a tiny, lost sound!-and
then it wailed no more. The steam rising from

1577
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:06,689
its skin had thinned to ribbons. I put my
mouth against its face, smelling blood and

1578
02:18:06,689 --> 02:18:12,660
the bland, damp aroma of placenta. I breathed
into its mouth and heard the jerky sussurrus

1579
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:17,070
of its breathing resume. Then the nurse was
there, the blanket in her arms.

1580
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:19,040
I held out my hand for it.

1581
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:26,551
She started to give it to me, and then held
it back. 'Doctor, what what if it's a monster?

1582
02:18:26,551 --> 02:18:27,870
Some kind of monster?'

1583
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:32,011
'Give me that blanket,' I said. 'Give it to
me now, Sarge, before I kick your fucking

1584
02:18:32,011 --> 02:18:34,400
asshole right up your fucking shoulderblades.'

1585
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:40,131
'Yes, doctor,' she said with perfect calmness
(we must bless the women, gentlemen, who so

1586
02:18:40,131 --> 02:18:45,820
often understand simply by not trying to),
and gave me the blanket I wrapped the child

1587
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:47,690
and gave it to her.

1588
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:50,219
'If you drop him, Sarge, you'll be eating
those stripes.'

1589
02:18:50,219 --> 02:18:51,219
'Yes, doctor.'

1590
02:18:51,219 --> 02:18:55,580
'It's cheap fucking magic, Sarge, but it's
all God left us with.'

1591
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:56,800
'Yes, doctor.'

1592
02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:01,420
I watched her half-walk, half-run back to
the hospital with the child and watched the

1593
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:07,429
crowd on the steps part for her. Then I rose
to my feet and backed away from the body.

1594
02:19:07,429 --> 02:19:14,550
Its breathing, like the baby's, hitched and
caught stopped hitched again stopped

1595
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:22,099
I began to back away from it. My foot struck
something. I turned. It was her head. And

1596
02:19:22,099 --> 02:19:27,760
obeying some directive from outside of me,
I dropped to one knee and turned the head

1597
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:34,740
over. The eyes were open-those direct hazel
eyes that had always been full of such life

1598
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:42,670
and such determination. They were full of
determination still. Gentlemen, she was seeing

1599
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:44,010
me.

1600
02:19:44,010 --> 02:19:49,250
Her teeth were clenched, her lips slightly
parted. I heard the breath slipping rapidly

1601
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:55,720
back and forth between those lips and through
those teeth as she "locomotived". Her eyes

1602
02:19:55,720 --> 02:20:00,740
moved; they rolled slightly to the left in
their sockets so as to see me better. Her

1603
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:09,790
lips parted. They mouthed four words: Thank
you, Doctor McCarron. And I heard them, gentlemen,

1604
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:15,970
but not from her mouth. They came from twenty
feet away. From her vocal cords. And because

1605
02:20:15,970 --> 02:20:21,340
her tongue and lips and teeth, all of which
we use to shape our words, were here, they

1606
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:29,040
came out only in unformed modulations of sound.
But there were seven of them, seven distinct

1607
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:34,610
sounds, just as there are seven syllables
in that phrase, Thank you, Doctor McCarron.

1608
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:42,300
'You're welcome, Miss Stansfield,' I said.
'It's a boy.' Her lips moved again, and from

1609
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:52,990
behind me, thin, ghostly, came the sound hoyyyyyy-Her
eyes lost their focus and their determination.

1610
02:20:52,990 --> 02:21:00,090
They seemed now to look at something beyond
me, perhaps in that black, sleety sky. Then

1611
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:09,390
they closed. She began to locomotive again
and then she simply stopped. Whatever had

1612
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:16,100
happened was now over. The nurse had seen
some of it, the ambulance driver had perhaps

1613
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:19,460
seen some of it before he fainted.

1614
02:21:19,460 --> 02:21:30,180
But it was over now, over for sure. There
was only the remains of an ugly accident out

1615
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:33,790
here and a new baby in there.

1616
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:41,280
I looked up at the statue of Harriet White
and there she still stood, looking stonily

1617
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:46,979
away towards the Garden across the way, as
if nothing of any particular note had happened,

1618
02:21:46,979 --> 02:21:54,300
as if such determination in a world as hard
and as senseless as this one meant nothing

1619
02:21:54,300 --> 02:22:01,330
or worse still, that it was perhaps the only
thing which meant anything, the only thing

1620
02:22:01,330 --> 02:22:05,710
that made any difference at all.

1621
02:22:05,710 --> 02:22:16,110
As I recall, I knelt there in the slush before
her severed head and began to weep. As I recall,

1622
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:25,890
I was still weeping when an intern and two
nurses helped me to my feet and inside.

1623
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:27,930
McCarron's pipe had gone out.

1624
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:38,399
He relit it with his bolt-lighter while we
sat in perfect, breathless silence. Outside,

1625
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:46,700
the wind howled and moaned. He snapped his
lighter closed and looked up. He seemed mildly

1626
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:49,460
surprised to find us still there.

1627
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:58,800
'That's all,' he said.' That's the end! What
are you waiting for? Chariots of fire?' He

1628
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:06,920
snorted, then seemed to debate for a moment
'I paid her burial expenses out of my own

1629
02:23:06,920 --> 02:23:15,010
pocket She had no one else, you see.' He smiled
a little. 'Well there was Ella Davidson, my

1630
02:23:15,010 --> 02:23:20,390
nurse. She insisted on chipping in twenty-five
dollars, which she could ill afford. But when

1631
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:27,220
Davidson insisted on a thing-' He shrugged,
and then laughed a little. 'You're quite sure

1632
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:32,050
it wasn't a reflex?' I heard myself demanding
suddenly. 'Are you quite sure -'

1633
02:23:32,050 --> 02:23:39,600
'Quite sure,' McCarron said imperturbably.
'The first contraction, perhaps. But the completion

1634
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:45,490
of her labour was not a matter of seconds
but of minutes. And I sometimes think she

1635
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:52,030
might have held on even longer, if it had
been necessary. Thank God it was not.'

1636
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:55,181
'What about the baby?' Johanssen asked.

1637
02:23:55,181 --> 02:23:59,971
McCarron puffed at his pipe. 'Adopted,' he
said. 'And you'll understand that, even in

1638
02:23:59,971 --> 02:24:03,479
those days, adoption records were kept as
secret as possible.'

1639
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:10,630
'Yes, but what about the baby?' Johanssen
asked again, and McCarron laughed in a cross

1640
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:11,630
way.

1641
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:15,610
'You never let go of a thing, do you?' he
asked Johanssen.

1642
02:24:15,610 --> 02:24:21,050
Johanssen shook his head. 'Some people have
learned it to their sorrow. What about the

1643
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:22,780
baby?'

1644
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:30,610
'Well, if you've come with me this far perhaps
you'll also understand that I had a certain

1645
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:41,899
vested interest in knowing how it all came
out for that child. Or I felt that I did.

1646
02:24:41,899 --> 02:24:46,910
There was a young man and his wife-their name
was not Harrison, but that is close enough.

1647
02:24:46,910 --> 02:24:53,840
They lived in Maine. They could have no children
of their own. They adopted the child and named

1648
02:24:53,840 --> 02:25:01,460
him well, John's good enough, isn't it? John
will do you fellows, won't it?' He puffed

1649
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:08,051
at his pipe but it had gone out again. I was
faintly aware of Stevens hovering behind me,

1650
02:25:08,051 --> 02:25:13,590
and knew that somewhere our coats would be
at the ready. Soon we would slip back into

1651
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:21,520
them and back into our lives. As McCarron
had said, the tales were done for another

1652
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,070
year.

1653
02:25:23,070 --> 02:25:27,601
The child I delivered that night is now head
of the English Department at one of the two

1654
02:25:27,601 --> 02:25:33,420
or three most respected private colleges in
the country,' McCarron said. 'He's not forty-five

1655
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:39,021
yet. A young man. It's early for him, but
the day may well come when he will be President

1656
02:25:39,021 --> 02:25:43,160
of that school. I shouldn't doubt it a bit.
He is handsome, intelligent, and charming.

1657
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:51,090
'Once, on a pretext, I was able to dine with
him in the private faculty club. We were four

1658
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:59,930
that evening. I said little and so was able
to watch him. He has his mother's determination,

1659
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:05,430
gentlemen ' and his mother's hazel eyes.'

1660
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:13,410
3: The Club

1661
02:26:13,410 --> 02:26:19,000
Stevens saw us out as he always did, holding
coats, wishing men the happiest of happy Christmases,

1662
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,630
thanking them for their generosity. I contrived
to be the last, and Stevens looked at me with

1663
02:26:23,630 --> 02:26:28,860
no surprise when I said: 'I have a question
I'd like to ask, if you don't mind.'

1664
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:35,189
He smiled a little. 'I suppose you should,'
he said, 'Christmas is a fine time for questions.'

1665
02:26:35,189 --> 02:26:41,180
Somewhere down the hallway to our left- a
hall I had never been down- a grandfather

1666
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:47,630
clock ticked sonorously, the sound of the
age passing away. I could smell old leather

1667
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:54,399
and oiled wood and, much more faintly than
either of these, the smell of Stevens's aftershave.

1668
02:26:54,399 --> 02:27:00,910
'But I should warn you,' Stevens added as
the wind rose in a gust outside, 'it's better

1669
02:27:00,910 --> 02:27:05,010
not to ask too much. Not if you want to keep
coming here.'

1670
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:11,000
'People have been closed out for asking too
much?' Closed out was not really the phrase

1671
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:14,311
I wanted, but it was as close as I could come.

1672
02:27:14,311 --> 02:27:22,390
'No,' Stevens said, his voice as low and polite
as ever. 'They simply choose to stay away.'

1673
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:30,561
I returned his gaze, feeling a chill prickle
its way up my back-it was as if a large, cold,

1674
02:27:30,561 --> 02:27:36,520
invisible hand had been laid on my spine.
I found myself remembering that strangely

1675
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:42,870
liquid thump I had heard upstairs one night
and wondered (as I had more than once before)

1676
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:46,610
exactly how many rooms there really were here.

1677
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:52,120
'If you still have a question, Mr Adley, perhaps
you'd better ask it. The evening's almost

1678
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,120
over -'

1679
02:27:53,120 --> 02:28:00,790
'And you have a long train-ride ahead of you?'
I asked, but Stevens only looked at me impassively.

1680
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:07,230
'All right,' I said. There are books in this
library that I can't find anywhere else-not

1681
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:13,330
in the New York Public Library, not in the
catalogues of any of the antiquarian book-dealers

1682
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:19,431
I've checked with, and certainly not in Books
in Print. The billiard table in the Small

1683
02:28:19,431 --> 02:28:25,390
Room is a Nord. I'd never heard of such a
brand, and so I called the International Trademark

1684
02:28:25,390 --> 02:28:31,600
Commission. They have two Nords-one makes
crosscountry skis and the other makes wooden

1685
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:39,570
kitchen accessories. There's a Seafront jukebox
in the Long Room. The ITC has a Seeburg listed,

1686
02:28:39,570 --> 02:28:40,760
but no Seafront.'

1687
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:45,270
'What is your question, Mr Adley?'

1688
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:53,110
His voice was as mild as ever, but there was
something terrible in his eyes suddenly no;

1689
02:28:53,110 --> 02:28:59,600
if I am to be truthful, it was not just in
his eyes; the terror I felt had infused the

1690
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:06,770
atmosphere all around me. The steady tock-tock
from down the lefthand hall was no longer

1691
02:29:06,770 --> 02:29:12,891
the pendulum of a grandfather clock; it was
the tapping foot of the executioner as he

1692
02:29:12,891 --> 02:29:19,189
watches the condemned led to the scaffold.
The smells of oil and leather turned bitter

1693
02:29:19,189 --> 02:29:26,101
and menacing, and when the wind rose in another
wild whoop, I felt momentarily sure that the

1694
02:29:26,101 --> 02:29:33,320
front door would blow open, revealing not
35th Street but an insane Clark Ashton Smith

1695
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:40,520
landscape where the bitter shapes of twisted
trees stood silhouetted on a sterile horizon

1696
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:45,260
below, which double suns were setting in a
gruesome red glare.

1697
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:52,490
Oh, he knew what I had meant to ask; I saw
it in his grey eyes.

1698
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:57,740
Where do all these things come from? I had
meant to ask. Oh, I know well enough where

1699
02:29:57,740 --> 02:30:03,600
you come from, Stevens; that accent isn't
Dimension X, it's pure Brooklyn. But where

1700
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:10,399
do you go? What has put that timeless look
in your eyes and stamped it on your face?

1701
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:16,080
And, Stevens-- where are we RIGHT THIS SECOND?

1702
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:18,310
But he was waiting for my question.

1703
02:30:18,310 --> 02:30:24,880
I opened my mouth. And the question that came
out was: 'Are there many more rooms upstairs?'

1704
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:34,350
'Oh, yes, sir,' he said, his eyes never leaving
mine. 'A great many. A man could become lost

1705
02:30:34,350 --> 02:30:44,430
In fact, men have become lost. Sometimes it
seems to me that they go on for miles. Rooms

1706
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:45,430
and corridors.'

1707
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:46,430
'And entrances and exits?'

1708
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:54,210
His eyebrows went up slightly. 'Oh yes. Entrances
and exits.' He waited, but I had asked enough,

1709
02:30:54,210 --> 02:31:02,721
I thought -I had come to the very edge of
something that would, perhaps, drive me mad.

1710
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:05,520
"Thank you, Stevens.'

1711
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:11,180
'Of course, sir.' He held out my coat and
I slipped into it.

1712
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:14,090
'There will be more tales?'

1713
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:20,210
'Here, sir, there are always more tales.'

1714
02:31:20,210 --> 02:31:27,090
That evening was some time ago, and my memory
has not improved between then and now (when

1715
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:32,399
a man reaches my age, the opposite is much
more likely to be true), but I remember with

1716
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:39,350
perfect clarity the stab of fear that went
through me when Stevens swung the oaken door

1717
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:46,800
wide-the cold certainty that I would see that
alien landscape, cracked and hellish in the

1718
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:53,670
bloody light of those double suns, which might
set and bring on an unspeakable darkness of

1719
02:31:53,670 --> 02:32:00,131
an hour's duration, or ten hours, or ten thousand
years. I cannot explain it, but I tell you

1720
02:32:00,131 --> 02:32:07,271
that world exists-I am as sure of that as
Emlyn McCarron was sure that the severed head

1721
02:32:07,271 --> 02:32:14,640
of Sandra Stansfield went on breathing. I
thought for that one timeless second that

1722
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:20,979
the door would open and Stevens would thrust
me out into that world and I would then hear

1723
02:32:20,979 --> 02:32:25,950
that door slam shut behind me forever.

1724
02:32:25,950 --> 02:32:36,280
Instead, I saw 35th Street and a radio-cab
standing at the curb, exhaling plumes of exhaust.

1725
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:41,150
I felt an utter, almost debilitating relief.

1726
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:52,070
'Yes, always more tales,' Stevens repeated.
'Goodnight, sir.' Always more tales.

1727
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:57,360
Indeed there have been. And, one day soon,
perhaps I'll tell you another.

1728
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:57,670
- THE END -
