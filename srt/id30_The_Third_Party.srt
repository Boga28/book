1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,700
In law, the third party is a person involved
in a situation in addition to the two main

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,979
people involved.

3
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:13,799
A third party quite often appears in cases
of divorce, for example.

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,370
However, all threesomes are different.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,750
And in some of them it is not always clear
which of the three people actually is the

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:50,510
third party...

7
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,789
The two men met by arrangement in the bar
of Buswell's Hotel, at half past eleven.

8
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,649
'I think we'll recognize each other all right,'
the older man had said.

9
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,390
'I expect she's told you what I look like.'

10
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,650
He was tall, his face pinkish-brown from the
sun, his fair hair turning grey.

11
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:17,440
The man he met was thinner, wearing glasses
and a black winter coat - a smaller man, whose

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,870
name was Lairdman.

13
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,220
'Well, we're neither of us late,' Boland said
a little nervously.

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,320
'Fergus Boland.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,970
How are you?'

16
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,920
They shook hands.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,020
Boland took out his wallet.

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,900
'I'll have a whiskey myself.

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,220
What'll I get you?'

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,890
'Oh, just a lemonade for me, Fergus, this
time of day.'

21
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,660
Boland ordered the drinks and they stood by
the bar.

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,340
Boland held out a packet of cigarettes.

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,160
'Do you smoke?'

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,810
Lairdman shook his head.

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,570
He placed an elbow tidily on the bar.

26
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,700
'Sorry about this,' he said.

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,640
They were alone except for the barman, who
put their two glasses in front of them.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Boland paid him.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,649
'I mean I'm really sorry,' Lairdman went on,
'doing this to anyone.'

30
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,500
'Good luck,' Boland said, raising his glass.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,050
He had softened the colour of the whiskey
by adding twice as much water.

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,569
'You never drink this early in the day, I
suppose?' he said, carefully polite.

33
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,620
'Well, that's very sensible, I always think.'

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,840
'I thought it might not be an occasion for
drinking.'

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,469
'I couldn't talk to you without a drink inside
me, Lairdman.'

36
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,019
'I'm sorry about that.'

37
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,590
'You've stolen my wife from me.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,189
It's not an everyday event.'

39
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:45,909
'I'm sorry-'

40
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:50,310
'It'd be better if you didn't keep saying
that.'

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,040
Lairdman made no protest at Boland's sharpness.

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,500
'The whole thing's awkward, I must confess.

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,600
I didn't sleep at all last night.'

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:05,010
'You're from Dublin, she tells me,' Boland
said, still politely.

45
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,120
'You're in the wood business.

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,510
There's money in that, no doubt.'

47
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,130
Lairdman was offended.

48
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,080
She'd described her husband as clumsy, but
had added he wouldn't hurt a fly.

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,150
Already, five minutes into the difficult meeting,
Lairdman wasn't so sure.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,139
'I don't like Dublin,' Boland continued.

51
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,810
'To be honest, I never have.

52
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm a small-town man, but of course you'll
know that.'

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,200
He imagined his wife telling her lover about
the narrowness of his experience.

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,219
She liked to tell people things; she talked
a lot.

55
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:45,000
'I want to thank you,' Lairdman said, 'for
taking all this so well.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,480
Annabella has told me.'

57
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,700
'I don't see that I have any choice.'

58
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,469
Lairdman's lips were very thin, his mouth
a line that smiled without any obvious effort.

59
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:02,939
I wonder why he doesn't have a funny little
moustache, like so many Dubliners, thought

60
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:03,939
Boland.

61
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,659
'I thought you might hit me when we met,'
Lairdman said.

62
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,560
'But Annabella said you weren't like that
at all.'

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,780
'No, I'm not.'

64
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,190
'That's what I mean by taking it well.'

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,349
'All I want to know is what your plans are.'

66
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,090
'Plans?'

67
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,150
'I'm just asking if you're thinking of marrying
her, and what your arrangements are.

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,250
I mean, have you a place that's suitable for
her?

69
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,250
I'll have another whiskey,' he said to the
barman.

70
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,780
'We were hoping that - if you agree - she
would move into my place more or less at once.

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,419
It's suitable all right - a seven- room flat
in Wellington Road.

72
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,000
But in time we'll get a house.'

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,870
'Thanks,' Boland said to the barman, paying
him.

74
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,830
'It was my turn to pay,' Lairdman protested,
just a little late.

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,610
She wouldn't care for meanness, Boland thought,
when it began to have an effect on her, which

76
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,310
it would, in time.

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,500
'But marriage?'

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Boland said.

79
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,080
'It isn't easy, you know, to marry another
man's wife in Ireland.'

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,139
'Annabella and I would naturally like to be
married one day.'

81
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,909
'That's what I wanted to ask you about.

82
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,140
How are you thinking of getting a divorce?

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,710
She doesn't really know much about it - we
talked about it for a long time.'

84
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,840
'Thank you for that.

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,210
And for suggesting we should meet.'

86
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:36,310
'You two have given me good reasons for a
divorce, Lairdman, but it's no damn use to

87
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,310
me.

88
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,050
A divorce will take years.'

89
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,449
'It wouldn't take so long if you had an address
in England.

90
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,960
Then we could get a divorce over there.'

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,580
'But I haven't an address in England.'

92
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,919
'It's only a thought, Fergus.'

93
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,100
'So she wasn't exaggerating when she said
you wanted to marry her?'

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,950
'I don't think I've ever known Annabella exaggerate,'
Lairdman replied stiffly.

95
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:06,879
Then you don't know the most important thing
about her, Boland thought - that is, she can't

96
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:14,250
help telling lies, which you and I might politely
describe as exaggerating.

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,520
'I'm surprised you never got married,' he
said.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,449
He really was surprised, because in his experience
self-confident little men like Lairdman very

99
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,449
often had a good-looking woman in their life.

100
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,259
'I've known your wife a long time,' Lairdman
said softly, trying not to let his smile show.

101
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:41,190
'As soon as I first saw Annabella, I knew
she was the only woman I'd ever want to marry.'

102
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,460
Boland stared into his whiskey.

103
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,650
He had to be careful about what he said.

104
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:51,449
If he became angry for a moment, he was quite
likely to ruin everything.

105
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,940
The last thing he wanted was for the man to
change his mind.

106
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,460
He lit a cigarette, again offering the packet
to Lairdman, who again shook his head.

107
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,069
In a friendly, conversational way Boland said,
'Lairdman's an interesting name.'

108
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:13,729
'It's not Irish - French maybe, or part of
it anyway.'

109
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:20,069
When she had said her lover's name was Lairdman,
Boland had remembered it from his schooldays,

110
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,050
and in Buswell's bar, he had immediately recognized
the face.

111
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,590
At school, Lairdman had been famous for an
unexpected reason: his head had been held

112
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,919
down a toilet while his hair was scrubbed
with a toilet brush.

113
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,280
The boys who had done this were older and
bigger than him.

114
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,110
Called Roche and Dead Smith, they took pleasure
in punishing small boys whose faces and habits

115
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,030
they found annoying.

116
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,889
'I think we were at school together,' Boland
said.

117
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,580
Lairdman almost gave a jump, and this time
it was Boland who tried not to smile.

118
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,180
Clearly, this had come as a shock to Lairdman.

119
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,349
'I don't remember a Boland,' Lairdman said.

120
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:08,050
'I'd have been a little older than you.

121
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,409
I hated the damn place.'

122
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,110
'Oh, I quite liked it,' Lairdman said.

123
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,520
'You day boys went home in the evenings and
at weekends, we boarders had to stay there

124
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,310
all the time.'

125
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,740
'I suppose that made a difference.'

126
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,530
'Of course it did.'

127
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,889
For the first, time Boland felt annoyed.

128
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,870
Not only was her lover mean, he was stupid
as well.

129
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,300
If he had any common sense at all, he'd realize
he'd be mad to buy a house for Annabella,

130
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,310
because no one could ever be sure she would
do what she had promised.

131
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,839
'I've always thought, actually, it gave an
excellent education,' Lairdman was saying.

132
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,540
The awful little Frenchman who couldn't make
himself understood.

133
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,540
The history teacher who gave the class a history
book to read while he wrote letters.

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,750
The mathematics man who couldn't solve the
problems he presented.

135
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,020
The head teacher who enjoyed causing as much
physical pain as possible.

136
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,810
'Oh, a great place,' Boland agreed.

137
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,790
'A fine school.'

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,130
'I'm sorry I don't remember you.'

139
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,930
'I wouldn't expect you to.'

140
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,510
'We'll probably send our children there.

141
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,899
If we have boys.'

142
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,269
'Your children?'

143
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,320
'You wouldn't mind?

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,450
Oh dear, no, why should you?

145
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm sorry, that was a silly thing to say.'

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,060
'I'm having another whiskey,' Boland said.

147
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,590
'How about you?'

148
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,970
'No, I'm OK, thanks.'

149
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,190
This time Lairdman didn't mention, even too
late, that he should pay.

150
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,790
Boland lit another cigarette.

151
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,080
So she hadn't told Lairdman?

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,769
She had let the poor man imagine that in no
time at all the seven-room flat wouldn't be

153
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,430
big enough for all the children they were
going to have.

154
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,230
Boland could almost hear her telling Lairdman
that her husband was to blame for their childless

155
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,230
marriage.

156
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,170
In fact, she'd discovered before they got
married that she couldn't have children; in

157
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,760
a quarrel long after the wedding she confessed
that she'd known and hadn't told him.

158
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,930
'Naturally,' Lairdman continued, 'we'd like
to have a family.'

159
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,190
'You would, of course.'

160
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,160
'I'm sorry that side of things didn't go right
for you.'

161
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,029
'I was sorry myself.'

162
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,780
'The thing is, Fergus, is it OK about the
divorce?'

163
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,180
'Are you saying I should agree to be the guilty
party?'

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,570
'It is what men in your situation usually
do, actually.

165
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,339
But if you don't like the idea of it-'

166
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:55,440
'Don't worry, I'll agree to be the guilty
party.'

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,029
'You're being great, Fergus.'

168
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,830
His wife used to say, 'I think I'll go up
and stay with Phyllis,' saying it more often

169
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,010
as time went by.

170
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,160
Phyllis was a woman she knew in Dublin.

171
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,139
But of course, Phyllis had just been a name
she'd used, a friend who would tell lies for

172
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,389
her if necessary.

173
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:21,730
'Phone me,' he used to say, and obediently
his wife phoned him, telling how Dublin looked

174
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,720
and how Phyllis was.

175
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,990
No doubt, she'd been sitting on the edge of
a bed in the seven-room flat in Wellington

176
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,310
Road.

177
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,540
'It's really good of you to come all this
way,' Lairdman said, sounding eager to end

178
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,190
the meeting.

179
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,850
'I'll ring Annabella this afternoon and tell
her all about it.

180
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,199
You won't mind that, Fergus?'

181
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,790
'Not at all.'

182
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,730
Boland had often interrupted such a telephone
conversation.

183
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,180
He would come home and find her sitting on
the stairs, talking on the phone.

184
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,040
As soon as he came through the door, she'd
wave a greeting and start to whisper secretively

185
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,149
into the phone.

186
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:09,380
The trouble with Annabella was that sooner
or later everything in the world bored her.

187
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,050
'Now I want to hear every single thing that's
happened since the moment you left home this

188
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,560
morning,' she would soon say to Lairdman.

189
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,350
And the poor man would begin a long story
about catching the bus and arriving at work

190
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,290
and having a cake with his coffee.

191
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,520
Later, in a quarrel, she would throw it all
back at him.

192
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,410
'Who could possibly want to know about your
damn cake?' she'd scream wildly at him, her

193
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,680
fingers spread out in the air so that her
blood-red nail varnish would dry evenly.

194
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:47,050
'I'll be able to say,' Lairdman was saying,
almost proudly, 'that neither of us got angry.

195
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,420
She'll be pleased about that.'

196
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,959
Boland couldn't imagine his wife being pleased,
since she hardly ever was.

197
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,700
He wondered what it was that she liked about
Lairdman.

198
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,529
When he'd asked her, she'd said her lover
was amusing, that he had what she called a

199
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,800
fantastic sense of fun.

200
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,459
'I wonder what became of Roche and Dead Smith,'
he said.

201
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,040
He didn't know why he said it, why he couldn't
accept that the business between them was

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,300
over.

203
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,740
He should have shaken hands with Lairdman
and left it at that, perhaps saying there

204
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,139
were no hard feelings.

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,390
He would never have to see the man again;
once in a while, he would simply feel sorry

206
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,199
for him.

207
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,180
'I don't remember either of them,' said Lairdman,
shaking his head.

208
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,740
'I'll say goodbye, Fergus.

209
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,740
I'm grateful, I really am.'

210
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,480
'They were the boys who had the bright idea
of washing your hair in a toilet bowl.'

211
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,870
Boland had said to himself over and over again
that Lairdman was welcome to her.

212
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,089
He looked ahead to an easy life, living alone.

213
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,040
The house she had filled with her moods and
her lies for the last twelve years would be

214
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,160
as silent as a peaceful sleep.

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,600
He would clear out the memories of her, because
naturally she wouldn't do that herself - the

216
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,089
old fashion magazines, the empty medicine
bottles, the clothes she had no further use

217
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:22,660
for, the curtains torn to pieces by her cats.

218
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,360
He would cook his own meals, and Mrs Couglan
would still come to clean every morning.

219
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,470
Mrs Couglan wouldn't exactly be sorry to see
her go, either.

220
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,390
'I don't know why you keep going on about
your schooldays,' Lairdman said.

221
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,839
'Let me get you a real drink before you go.

222
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,360
Two big ones,' Boland called to the barman.

223
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,079
'No, really,' Lairdman protested.

224
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,560
'Really now.'

225
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,339
He had put on his coat and a pair of black
leather gloves.

226
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,300
'Oh, go on, man.

227
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,260
We're both in need of it.'

228
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:05,139
Finger by finger Lairdman took one of the
gloves off again, and unwillingly picked up

229
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:06,839
the new glass.

230
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,970
They drank.

231
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:14,160
'I only mentioned the school,' Boland said,
'because that was the other thing that you

232
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,149
and I shared.'

233
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,380
'As I said, I think we'd maybe send the children
there.'

234
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,050
'You don't remember it?'

235
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,050
Boland asked.

236
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,420
'What's that?'

237
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,690
'The toilet thing.'

238
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,290
'Look here, Boland-'

239
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,560
'I've offended you.

240
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,610
I didn't mean that at all.'

241
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,380
'Of course you haven't offended me.

242
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:44,040
It's just that I see no reason to keep going
on about things like that.'

243
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,830
'We'll talk of something else.'

244
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,540
'Actually, I'm getting late.'

245
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,529
The second glove was pulled on again, the
coat buttons were checked to see that all

246
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,839
was well for the street.

247
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:05,959
The glove was removed again when Lairdman
remembered there'd have to be a handshake.

248
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,500
'Thanks for everything,' he said.

249
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,290
For the second time, Boland surprised himself
by being unable to let the matter rest.

250
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,160
'You mention your children,' he heard himself
saying.

251
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,920
'Would these be your and Annabella's children?'

252
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,640
Lairdman's mouth dropped open and he stared
at Boland.

253
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,750
'What other children are there?' he asked,
shaking his head in a puzzled way.

254
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,650
'She can't have children, Lairdman.'

255
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,820
'Oh now, look here-'

256
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,020
'That's a medical fact.

257
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,629
The unfortunate woman is incapable of being
a mother.'

258
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:52,160
'I think you're drunk.

259
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,960
One whiskey after another you've had.

260
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,829
Annabella's told me a thing or two about you,
you know.'

261
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:01,770
'She hasn't told you about the cats she's
going to bring with her.

262
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,780
She hasn't told you she can't have children.

263
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,890
She hasn't told you she gets so bored that
her face turns white with anger.

264
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,579
It's best not to be near her then, Lairdman.

265
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,630
Take my advice on that.'

266
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,189
'She's told me you can't stay sober.'

267
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,010
'Except for occasions like this, I hardly
ever drink.

268
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,620
I drink a lot less than Annabella does, I
can promise you.'

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,970
'You've been unable to give Annabella children.

270
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,910
She's sorry for you, she doesn't blame you.'

271
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,360
'Annabella was never sorry for anyone in her
life.'

272
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,330
'Now look here, Boland-'

273
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,360
'Look nowhere, man.

274
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
I've had twelve years of the woman.

275
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm ready to let you take my place.

276
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,350
But there's no need for this talk of divorce,
I'm just telling you that.

277
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,250
She'll come and live with you in your seven-room
flat; she'll live in any house you like to

278
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,240
buy, but if you wait forever, you won't find
children coming along.

279
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,340
All you'll have is two cats that want to bite
the legs off you.'

280
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,640
'You're being most unpleasant, Boland.'

281
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,280
'I'm telling you the truth.'

282
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,039
'You seem to have forgotten that Annabella
and myself have talked about all this.

283
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,380
She knew there'd be bitterness.

284
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,770
Well, I understand that.

285
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,260
I've said I'm sorry.'

286
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,850
'You're a mean little wooden man, Lairdman.

287
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,919
Your head belongs in a toilet bowl.

288
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,900
Were you all wet when they let go of you?

289
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,960
I'd love to have seen it, Lairdman.'

290
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,870
'Will you keep your damn voice down?

291
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,860
And stop trying to quarrel with me!

292
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,150
I won't stand here and listen to this.'

293
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,809
'I think Dead Smith went on to become a-'

294
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,990
'I don't care what he became.'

295
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,789
Suddenly Lairdman was gone.

296
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:56,430
Boland didn't even turn his head.

297
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,659
After a moment he lit a fresh cigarette.

298
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:04,950
For half an hour, he remained alone, where
his wife's lover had left him, thinking about

299
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,420
his schooldays and Lairdman.

300
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,920
He had lunch in the dining room of the hotel,
ordering soup and fish.

301
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,260
He imagined himself, one day in the future,
entering the silence of his house.

302
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,370
He'd actually been born in it.

303
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,380
Opposite O'Connor's garage, it was the last
one in the town, yellow-painted and ordinary,

304
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,690
but a house he loved.

305
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,890
'Did you say the fish, sir?'

306
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,620
the waitress enquired.

307
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,559
'Yes, I did.'

308
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,620
He'd got married in Dublin, as Annabella's
family lived there.

309
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,190
His friends and neighbours had been delighted
when he brought her to live among them.

310
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,340
They stopped him in the street and told him
how lucky he was.

311
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,110
But those same people would be delighted when
she left.

312
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,460
The terrible bitterness that filled her, because
of not being able to have children, eventually

313
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,200
turned her beauty into a kind of madness.

314
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,860
That's what had happened, nothing else.

315
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,140
Slowly he ate his fish.

316
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,850
Nobody would mention it much; they'd know
what had happened and they'd say to one another

317
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,779
that one day, probably, he'd marry again.

318
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,110
He wondered if he would.

319
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,320
He ordered a slice of apple cake with cream,
and later coffee came.

320
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,340
He was glad it was all over.

321
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,520
Now he had accepted the truth; it had been
necessary to hear it from someone other than

322
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,980
his wife.

323
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,789
When first she'd told him, he'd wondered if
it was all just another of her lies.

324
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,539
He paid his bill and went out to the car park.

325
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:48,779
It was because there hadn't been enough for
her to do, he thought, as he drove out of

326
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,740
Dublin through the heavy city traffic.

327
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,150
A childless woman in a small town had all
the time in the world.

328
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,820
She had changed the furniture around, and
had chosen the wallpaper that her cats had

329
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
later damaged.

330
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,220
But she hadn't joined any clubs or made any
friends.

331
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,740
He'd driven her to Dublin as often as he could,
before she'd started going there alone to

332
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,640
visit Phyllis.

333
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,309
For years, he'd known she wasn't happy, but
until she told him, he'd never suspected she

334
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,279
had become involved with a man.

335
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,429
Lairdman would have telephoned her by now,
perhaps to say, 'Why don't you drive up this

336
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:30,610
afternoon?'

337
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,710
Maybe all day she had been packing, knowing
the meeting at Buswell's was nothing to worry

338
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,870
about.

339
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,530
The little white Volkswagen he'd bought her
might be on the road to Dublin already.

340
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,980
He was on the open road now, looking out for
the Volkswagen coming towards him.

341
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,789
If she passed him, would she greet him with
a touch on the horn?

342
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,440
Or would he greet her?

343
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,419
He didn't know if he would.

344
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,510
Better to wait.

345
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,010
But over the next fifty miles or so, there
was no sign of his wife's car.

346
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,059
And of course, he told himself, there was
no reason why there should be.

347
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:10,720
It was only his own idea that she might depart
that afternoon, and surely, she'd need more

348
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,850
than a day to pack all her things.

349
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,059
The more he thought about it, the less likely
it was that she would be capable of completing

350
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,679
the move alone.

351
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,300
He turned the radio on, and heard a song called
'Dancing in the dark'.

352
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,770
It reminded him of the world he supposed his
wife and Lairdman belonged to, the excitement

353
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,950
of secret love, dancing close together in
the darkness.

354
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,930
'Poor Annabella,' he said aloud, while the
music still played.

355
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,220
Poor girl, to have married a small town businessman
like himself.

356
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,360
It was lucky, really, that she had met self-confident
little Lairdman.

357
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,270
He imagined them in each other's arms, and
then their shared smile before they held each

358
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,270
other close again.

359
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,940
As the dull third party, he had no further
part to play.

360
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,760
But as Boland reached the first few houses
on this side of his hometown, he knew none

361
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,110
of that was right.

362
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,030
The little white car had not carried her to
Lairdman today.

363
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,340
It would not do so tomorrow or the next day.

364
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,720
It would not do so next month, or after Christmas,
or in February, or in spring.

365
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,810
It would never do so.

366
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,720
It hadn't mattered reminding Lairdman of what
he had suffered as a schoolboy; it hadn't

367
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,549
mattered telling him she was in the habit
of lying, or even calling him mean.

368
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,679
That kind of unpleasant talk was more or less
expected in the situation they found themselves

369
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,100
in, and might simply be the result of a few
whiskeys.

370
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,580
But something had driven Boland to go further.

371
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,880
Little men like Lairdman always wanted children.

372
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,231
'That's a total lie,' she'd have said already
on the telephone, and Lairdman would have

373
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:00,900
pretended to believe her.

374
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,760
But pretending wasn't going to be enough for
either of them.

375
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,330
Boland turned the radio off.

376
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,600
He stopped the car outside Donovan's pub and
sat there for a moment, before going in.

377
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:19,180
At the bar, he greeted men he knew, and stood
drinking with them, listening to talk of horses

378
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,830
and politicians.

379
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,350
They left after a few more drinks, but Boland
stayed there for a long time, wondering why

380
00:24:28,350 --> 00:25:04,450
he hadn't been able to let Lairdman take her
from him.

381
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:08,080
- THE END -
