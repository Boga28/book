00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,760
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,450
Veney, Switzerland
Vevey is a beautiful little town on the shore

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,930
of a very blue lake in Switzerland.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,520
Tourism is the business of the place, and
there are many hotels.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,020
American tourists particularly like the hotel
called the Trois Couronnes.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:31,320
Two years ago, a young American named Frederick
Winterbourne spent a few days there.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,359
He had come from Geneva to see his aunt, Mrs
Costello, who was staying at the Trois Couronnes.

8
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,409
The morning after Winterbourne arrived in
Vevey, his aunt had a headache, so he was

9
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:51,210
free to sit in the garden of the hotel and
enjoy its beauties.

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,449
He sat by the wall, looking out at the Castle
of Chillon, which stood on a small island

11
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,340
in the lake.

12
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,080
Winterbourne was twenty-seven years old and
had lived in Geneva for a long time.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,000
He had been at school and university there.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,390
When his friends spoke of him, they usually
said that he was at Geneva 'studying'.

15
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,460
When certain other people spoke of him they
said that he spent so much time in Geneva

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,020
because he was very attached to a lady who
lived there - a European lady - a person older

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,350
than himself.

18
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,350
None of his American friends had ever met
this lady.

19
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,930
As Winterbourne was drinking his coffee in
the garden of the Trois Couronnes, a small

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,620
boy came up to him and said, 'Can you give
me a lump of sugar?'

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,730
Winterbourne noticed that the boy spoke with
an American accent.

22
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:57,210
He pointed to the bowl of sugar and said,
'Take one, but I don't think sugar is good

23
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,850
for little boys.'

24
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,800
The boy took three lumps of sugar.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,220
He put two in his pocket and one in his mouth.

26
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,090
'I eat sugar lumps,' he said, 'because I can't
get any candy here.

27
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,090
American candy is the best.'

28
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,810
'And are American boys the best?' asked Winterbourne.

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,510
'I don't know,' said the child.

30
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,260
'I am an American boy.

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,299
Are you an American man?'

32
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,349
'Yes.'

33
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,739
'American men are the best!' said the boy.

34
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:35,829
Then, looking round, he added, 'Here comes
my sister!'

35
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:40,549
Winterbourne looked up and saw a beautiful
young lady coming towards them.

36
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:44,999
'American girls are the best!' he said cheerfully
to his companion.

37
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:49,120
'My sister isn't the best,' said the boy.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,360
'She's always criticising me.'

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,499
'That's probably your fault, not hers,' said
Winterbourne.

40
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,170
The young lady was dressed very elegantly
in white.

41
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,749
'How pretty they are!'

42
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,450
thought Winterbourne, preparing to get up.

43
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,310
The young lady stopped in front of him.

44
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,909
She looked out over the blue lake.

45
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,049
'Randolph!'

46
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,049
she said.

47
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,390
'What are you doing?'

48
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,249
'I'm talking to this man,' said Randolph.

49
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,420
'He's an American.'

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,969
Winterbourne stood up and said, 'Your brother
and I have been discussing America.'

51
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:30,609
He felt a little embarrassed: in Geneva, a
gentleman could not speak to a young lady

52
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,440
without being formally introduced.

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,329
The young lady looked at him quickly then
looked back at the lake.

54
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,540
'We've been talking about American candy,'
said the boy.

55
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,549
'I don't want to go to Italy.

56
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,669
I want to go home to America!'

57
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,090
'Are you going to Italy?' asked Winterbourne.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,209
'Yes,' replied the young lady.

59
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,049
'Italy is a beautiful place.'

60
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,849
'But can you get any candy there?' asked Randolph.

61
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:03,769
'I think you've had enough candy,' said his
sister, 'and Mother thinks so too.'

62
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,430
'Isn't this a splendid lake?' said Winterbourne.

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,389
He no longer felt embarrassed, because he
realised that the young lady did not feel

64
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,840
embarrassed.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,850
When she looked at him, her eyes were honest
and fresh.

66
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,470
They were very pretty eyes.

67
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,940
In fact, she was the prettiest girl he had
seen for a long time.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:32,910
Her face was delicate but perhaps a little
vulgar; it was bright, sweet, and superficial.

69
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,260
He thought that she might be a flirt, but
her expression was too innocent.

70
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,490
Before long, she was speaking to him freely.

71
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,210
She told him that she was going to Rome for
the winter with her mother and Randolph.

72
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,750
She told him that she was from New York State.

73
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,950
'Her name's Daisy Miller,' said Randolph.

74
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,690
'But that isn't her real name.

75
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,170
Her real name is Annie P. Miller.

76
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,590
And my father's name is Ezra B. Miller.

77
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,380
He's back in New York State.

78
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,540
He's got a big business.

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,750
My father's rich.'

80
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:17,250
Miss Miller sat down and talked to Winterbourne
while Randolph ran round the garden.

81
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,650
She talked a lot - about her family, about
her travels in Europe, about the hotels and

82
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,930
the trains.

83
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,450
Sometimes she looked at Winterbourne, and
sometimes she looked out at the lake.

84
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,810
'The hotels are very good,' said Miss Daisy
Miller.

85
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,890
'And I think Europe is perfectly sweet.

86
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,860
I'm not disappointed - not at all.

87
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,080
I knew a lot about Europe before I came here.

88
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,770
I have lots of friends at home who have travelled
in Europe, and they told me all about it.

89
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,550
And back home I have lots of dresses from
Paris...'

90
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,870
Winterbourne enjoyed this conversation.

91
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,170
It was many years since he had heard a young
girl talk so much.

92
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,250
'The only thing I don't like about Europe
is the society,' said Miss Miller.

93
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,620
'I like society.

94
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,680
Last winter seventeen dinners were given in
my honour, three of them by gentlemen.'

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,960
She looked at him with her slightly monotonous
smile and said, 'I've always had a lot of

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,000
gentlemen friends.'

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,020
Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and charmed.

98
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,270
He felt that he had lived too long in Geneva
and therefore could no longer understand young

99
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,430
American girls.

100
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,740
He had never met a girl like this before.

101
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,860
Was she simply a pretty girl from New York
- were they all like that?

102
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,720
Or was she an immoral young woman?

103
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,020
She looked extremely innocent.

104
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,030
Winterbourne decided that she was just a pretty
American flirt.

105
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,440
He was happy to have found a formula to describe
Miss Daisy Miller.

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,480
'Have you been to that old castle?' asked
Miss Miller, pointing to the Castle of Chillon.

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
'Yes.'

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,430
'I want to go there, but Randolph doesn't
want to go.'

109
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,870
'You could ask someone to stay with Randolph
at the hotel.'

110
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,780
'Will you stay with him?'

111
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,310
'Can't I come to the Castle of Chillon with
you?' asked Winterbourne.

112
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,870
He was afraid that he had offended her, but
she did not blush.

113
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,470
'And your mother, of course,' he said very
respectfully.

114
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,650
'Oh, Mother won't come,' said Miss Daisy Miller.

115
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:32,080
'She'll stay with Randolph, and Eugenio will
stay too - he's our courier - so we can go

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,690
to the castle.'

117
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,990
Winterbourne thought, '"We" can only mean
Miss Miller and I, it's too good to be true!'

118
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,080
At that moment Eugenio came up to them.

119
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,310
He looked at Winterbourne with suspicion then
said, 'Lunch is ready, mademoiselle.'

120
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,190
'Oh, Eugenio!'

121
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,560
Daisy Miller replied, 'I'm going to that old
castle anyway.'

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,660
'Really?' said Eugenio.

123
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,560
He looked at Winterbourne disrespectfully.

124
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,070
Miss Miller blushed a little.

125
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,420
'We are going, aren't we?'

126
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,860
she asked Winterbourne.

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,440
'I won't be happy until we go!' he said.

128
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,400
'And you are staying at this hotel?'

129
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,780
she continued.

130
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,300
'And you really are an American?'

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,550
'I'll introduce you to my aunt, Mrs Costello.

132
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,880
She can tell you all about me.'

133
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,740
'Oh, well,' said Daisy Miller, 'we'll go some
day.'

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:34,400
She smiled at Winterbourne and walked back
to the hotel with Eugenio.

135
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,250
CHAPTER TWO
Mrs Costello

136
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,630
The next day, Winterbourne went to see his
aunt in her room.

137
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,640
'I hope you're feeling better,' he said.

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,550
'A little,' replied Mrs Costello.

139
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,490
She was a rich widow and an important figure
of New York society.

140
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,050
She had a long pale face and a lot of white
hair.

141
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,760
She had two married sons in New York and a
third son who was travelling in Europe but

142
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,630
had not come to see her.

143
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,320
Winterbourne had come to Vevey just to see
his aunt.

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,510
She often told him that he paid more attention
to her than her own sons did.

145
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,480
'Have you noticed an American family here
at the hotel?' asked Winterbourne.

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,810
'A family called Miller?'

147
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,160
'A mother, a daughter, a little boy, and a
courier?

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, yes!

149
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,110
I've noticed them!' said Mrs Costello.

150
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,060
'I confess I'm very exclusive, but in New
York you have to be.

151
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,110
There are so many vulgar people in society
these days.

152
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,279
That Miller family is a perfect example.'

153
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,620
'The young girl is very pretty,' said Winterbourne.

154
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,600
'Of course she's pretty, but she's very vulgar.

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,970
She's too friendly with the courier.

156
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,250
Her mother is just as bad.

157
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,340
They treat the courier like a family friend.

158
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,680
He probably eats dinner with them.

159
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,460
I'm sure they've never seen a man with such
good manners, such fine clothes, so like a

160
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,980
gentleman!

161
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,860
He sits with them in the garden and smokes
cigars.'

162
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,620
'I see what you mean, of course,' said the
young man, 'but I met the young lady in the

163
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
garden.

164
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,200
I'd like to introduce her to you.'

165
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
'I'm afraid I can't meet her!

166
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,279
Why do you want to introduce her to me?'

167
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,740
'To guarantee my respectability.'

168
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,630
'But who'll guarantee hers?'

169
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,420
'Ah, you're cruel!' said the young man.

170
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,760
'She's a very nice girl and completely unsophisticated.

171
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,820
I'm going to take her to the Castle of Chillon.'

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,170
'Really?

173
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:49,390
And how long had you known her when this plan
was formed?' asked Mrs Costello in surprise.

174
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,480
'Half an hour!' said Winterbourne, smiling.

175
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,100
'Oh, what a terrible girl!'

176
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,430
cried Mrs Costello.

177
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,980
'My dear Frederick, you've been away from
America too long.

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,910
You're too innocent.

179
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,440
You'll make some great mistake.'

180
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,110
'I'm not so innocent!'

181
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,300
'You're too guilty, then!'

182
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,350
Winterbourne sat in silence for a while then
said, 'So I can't introduce her to you?'

183
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,350
'No.

184
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,480
I can't accept a girl who talks to strangers
in hotels.'

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,250
'But don't all the young girls in America
do that sort of thing?'

186
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,130
'My grand-daughters don't do that sort of
thing!' said Mrs Costello.

187
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,700
Winterbourne had heard his pretty cousins
in New York described as 'terrible flirts'.

188
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,560
If Miss Daisy Miller did things that his cousins
did not do, she must be very unconventional

189
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,460
indeed.

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,930
Winterbourne was impatient to see her again.

191
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,300
That evening, he met Miss Daisy Miller walking
in the garden.

192
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,720
She seemed very pleased to see him.

193
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,089
'Have you been walking here all alone?' he
asked.

194
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,220
'No,' she replied.

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,190
'I've been walking with Mother, but she's
gone to find Randolph.

196
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,400
She wants him to go to bed.

197
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,920
He doesn't like to go to bed before eleven.'

198
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,770
Winterbourne and Daisy walked in the garden
together.

199
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,300
'I hear that your aunt is very exclusive,'
said Daisy.

200
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,750
'I want to meet her.

201
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,180
I know I'll like her.'

202
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,020
Winterbourne was embarrassed.

203
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,660
'I'm afraid she often has headaches,' he said.

204
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,050
Daisy looked at him for a moment then said,
'She doesn't want to meet me!

205
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,870
Why don't you just say so?

206
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,670
You needn't be afraid.

207
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,340
I'm not afraid!'

208
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,700
She gave a little nervous laugh.

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,790
Winterbourne wanted to comfort her.

210
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:47,610
He wanted to tell her that his aunt was a
snob and that her opinion was not important.

211
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,790
But just then a lady came into the garden
and stood at a distance from them, looking

212
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,400
out at the lake.

213
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
'Oh.

214
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,350
There's Mother,' said Daisy Miller.

215
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,149
Mrs Miller was a small nervous-looking person,
very elegantly dressed, with enormous diamonds

216
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,149
in her ears.

217
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,020
'I should go,' said Winterbourne.

218
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,930
'No, no,' replied Daisy.

219
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,190
'I want to introduce you to Mother.

220
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,830
I always introduce my gentlemen friends to
Mother.'

221
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,290
'She doesn't seem to want to be introduced
to me,' said Winterbourne, since Mrs Miller

222
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,670
still had not looked at him.

223
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:30,960
'She's very shy,' Daisy explained, then she
took Winterbourne over to meet her mother.

224
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,980
'Mother, this is Mr Winterbourne,' said Daisy
very prettily.

225
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,850
Yes, Miss Daisy Miller was vulgar, as Mrs
Costello had said, but Winterbourne thought

226
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,529
she also had an unusual and delicate grace.

227
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,380
'Did you convince Randolph to go to bed?'
asked Daisy.

228
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,649
'No,' replied Mrs Miller.

229
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,839
'He won't go.'

230
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,190
'He won't do what he's told,' said Daisy.

231
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:02,040
'He won't go to that castle either, so I'm
going with Mr Winterbourne.'

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,240
'It's a beautiful castle, Mrs Miller,' said
Winterbourne.

233
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,140
'Don't you want to see it?'

234
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,640
'No, thank you,' said Mrs Miller.

235
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,029
'Daisy will go, though.'

236
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:17,490
Winterbourne thought how very different Mrs
Miller was from the vigilant mothers of Geneva.

237
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,410
They never let their daughters go anywhere
unprotected.

238
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,850
'Mr Winterbourne,' said Daisy suddenly.

239
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,240
'Will you take me out in a boat?'

240
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
'Now?'

241
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,390
'Yes, now.'

242
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,540
'Well, Annie Miller!'

243
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,600
cried her mother.

244
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,890
'I'm sure that Mr Winterbourne wants to take
me out in a boat!' said Daisy, laughing.

245
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,420
'But what time is it?

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm sure it's time to go to bed!' said Mrs
Miller.

247
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,410
'It's eleven o'clock, madam,' said a voice
from the darkness.

248
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,370
'Oh, Eugenio,' said Daisy.

249
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,480
'I'm going out in a boat!'

250
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,570
'At eleven o'clock, mademoiselle?'

251
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,450
'Please tell her she can't go,' said Mrs Miller
to the courier.

252
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,400
'Does mademoiselle want to go alone?' asked
Eugenio.

253
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,460
'No,' Mrs Miller replied.

254
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,120
'She wants to go with this gentleman!'

255
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,050
Eugenio looked at Winterbourne, then he said,
'As mademoiselle pleases.'

256
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,090
'Why don't you say no?' said Daisy to the
courier.

257
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,180
'I don't want to go now.'

258
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,930
She turned to Winterbourne, smiled, and said,
'Good night.

259
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,820
I hope you're disgusted or disappointed or
something.'

260
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,830
'I'm confused,' said Winterbourne.

261
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:39,880
He stood and watched the two ladies and their
courier as they walked back into the hotel.

262
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,870
CHAPTER THREE
The Castle of Chillon

263
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,170
Two days later, Winterbourne and Miss Miller
went to the Castle of Chillon.

264
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,580
They met by the main door of the hotel.

265
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,740
Daisy ran down the stairs, with a bright smile
on her face.

266
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,850
She was simply but elegantly dressed.

267
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,550
All the couriers, servants, and foreign tourists
in the main hall stared at her.

268
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,990
To Winterbourne their trip to the castle seemed
romantic: he thought of it as an adventure,

269
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,110
and he hoped that she did too, but in this
respect he was disappointed.

270
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,450
She seemed happy but not excited.

271
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,180
She did not blush when she looked at him or
when she saw that other people were looking

272
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,450
at her.

273
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,360
Winterbourne wanted to go to the castle in
a carriage, over the wooden bridge that connected

274
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,060
the island to the shore, but Daisy said that
she preferred to go in the little steamboat.

275
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,990
She liked the breeze on the lake.

276
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,950
The steamboat was very crowded, and the people
stared at Miss Daisy Miller.

277
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:57,440
Winterbourne thought, 'Will she embarrass
me by talking too loudly or laughing too much?'

278
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,149
But soon he forgot those anxieties.

279
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,280
He stood smiling at her and listening to her
conversation.

280
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,870
He had agreed with his aunt when she had said
that Miss Daisy Miller was vulgar, but now

281
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,390
he felt uncertain.

282
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:18,850
'Is she really vulgar?' he asked himself,
watching her pretty face.

283
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,250
Winterbourne did not feel embarrassed by her
at all.

284
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,930
In fact, he felt rather proud to be with such
a beautiful and elegant young lady.

285
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,860
She talked a lot, and most of her conversation
was about the things she had seen and done.

286
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,309
She asked him many questions about his life
and opinions, and she told him about herself

287
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,110
and her family.

288
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,820
At one point, she turned to him and said,
'Why are you so serious?'

289
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,220
'Serious?'

290
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,860
asked the young man in surprise.

291
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,049
'I thought I was grinning from ear to ear!'

292
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:57,630
'You look as if you were taking me to a funeral.

293
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,010
If that's a grin, your ears are very close
together!'

294
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,480
'I'm having the time of my life,' said Winterbourne
quietly.

295
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,260
She looked at him for a moment then laughed:
'I like to make you say those things!

296
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,160
You're a strange mixture!'

297
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,580
It was a beautiful sunny day.

298
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,520
At the castle, they walked around alone except
for the guide.

299
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,130
Winterbourne asked the guide not to hurry,
to let them pause wherever they pleased.

300
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,020
He gave the guide a generous tip as he said
this.

301
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,600
The guide thought he was being paid to leave
them in peace, and he did so.

302
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,100
Daisy ran up the stairs and looked out of
the little windows with great enthusiasm,

303
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,540
but Winterbourne could see that she was not
really interested in the old castle.

304
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:55,370
She asked him about the history of the place,
and when he had explained it, she said, 'You

305
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,559
certainly know a lot.

306
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,350
Do you want to come travelling with us and
teach Randolph?'

307
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,460
'I'm afraid I can't,' Winterbourne replied.

308
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,670
'Why not?

309
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,179
You don't work.

310
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,520
You're not in business.

311
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
Why can't you do what you want?'

312
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,130
'There are things I must do in Geneva.

313
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,750
In fact, I must go back there tomorrow.'

314
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,780
'I don't believe it!'

315
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,600
cried Miss Daisy Miller.

316
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,000
'I'm afraid it's true.'

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,250
'Well, Mr Winterbourne, I think you're horrible!'

318
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,500
For the next ten minutes she kept repeating
that he was horrible.

319
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,880
Poor Winterbourne was confused.

320
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,210
No young lady had ever done him the honour
of being so agitated by his departure.

321
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,020
'I suppose you must be going to see a lady
there!' said Daisy.

322
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,700
'No, I'm not!'

323
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,200
protested Winterbourne, but he thought, 'How
does she know about the lady?'

324
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,830
He was surprised by her insight and by the
honest way she confronted him about the lady

325
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,490
in Geneva.

326
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,390
Miss Daisy Miller seemed to him an extraordinary
mixture of innocence and vulgarity.

327
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:10,720
'Does she never allow you out for more than
three days?' asked Daisy sarcastically.

328
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,770
'Doesn't she give you a vacation in the summer?

329
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,610
But never mind.

330
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,010
I'll forgive you if you promise to come to
Rome in the winter.'

331
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,440
'Certainly I'll come,' said Winterbourne.

332
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,450
'My aunt has a house in Rome, and I've promised
to visit her there this winter.'

333
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,630
'I don't want you to come for your aunt,'
said Miss Daisy Miller.

334
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,669
'I want you to come for me.'

335
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,430
After this, Daisy lost all interest in the
castle and the lake.

336
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,169
Winterbourne found a carriage to take them
back to the hotel.

337
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:47,720
On the journey back, she was very quiet.

338
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,510
CHAPTER FOUR
Meeting in rome

339
00:20:50,510 --> 00:21:01,179
The next day, Winterbourne returned to Geneva,
but in January he went to Rome, as promised.

340
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,980
On his first evening there, his aunt said
to him, 'That Miller family is here.

341
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,890
The girl goes out alone with Italian men - well-known
Roman fortune-hunters.

342
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,420
And she takes them to respectable people's
houses!

343
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,330
It's a great scandal.

344
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,840
When she comes to a party, she brings with
her a gentleman with elegant manners and a

345
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,030
splendid moustache.'

346
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,800
'And where's her mother?' asked Winterbourne.

347
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,780
'I've no idea,' Mrs Costello replied.

348
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,540
'They're terrible people.'

349
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,860
Winterbourne thought for a moment.

350
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,970
'They're just very ignorant and innocent.

351
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,760
I really don't believe that they're bad people.'

352
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,790
'They're very vulgar,' said his aunt.

353
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:53,910
'You may say that being vulgar is different
from being bad, but I don't see the difference.'

354
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:58,850
Winterbourne had imagined Miss Daisy Miller
looking out of her window in a Roman hotel

355
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,770
rather sadly, waiting for him to arrive.

356
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:08,500
This new picture of her surrounded by Roman
fortune-hunters did not please him, so he

357
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,400
did not go to visit her on his first day in
Rome.

358
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,179
Instead he went to the house of Mrs Walker,
an American lady he knew from Geneva, where

359
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,590
her children were at school.

360
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,550
She lived in the Via Gregoriana.

361
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,010
Winterbourne found her in a little red drawing-room
full of afternoon sunshine.

362
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:35,410
As he was talking to Mrs Walker, the servant
came in and announced, 'Mrs Miller!'.

363
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,150
Then Randolph entered the room, followed by
Daisy and her mother.

364
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,000
'Well!' said Daisy in surprise.

365
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,750
'I didn't know you were in Rome!

366
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,870
Why didn't you come to see me?'

367
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,520
'I only arrived yesterday,' replied Winterbourne.

368
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,400
Randolph looked around the room and said,
'We've got a bigger place than this.

369
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,740
The walls are all gold.'

370
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,530
'Oh, Randolph!' said Mrs Miller nervously.

371
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,210
'Are you enjoying Rome?'

372
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,840
Winterbourne asked her.

373
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,520
'Well, I'm rather disappointed,' she replied.

374
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,480
'We'd heard so much about it, but we've seen
other places I like much better.'

375
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,040
'Really?

376
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Which places?'

377
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,660
'For example, Zurich,' said Mrs Miller.

378
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,450
'I think Zurich is lovely, and we hadn't heard
much about it.'

379
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,690
'The best place we've been is the City of
Richmond,' said Randolph.

380
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,180
'He means the ship that brought us to Europe,'
Mrs Miller explained.

381
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,880
'Randolph enjoyed the City of Richmond.'

382
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,049
'It's the best place I've seen,' said Randolph,
'but it was going the wrong way.'

383
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,660
'I hope Miss Miller is enjoying Rome,' said
Winterbourne.

384
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,610
'Oh, yes,' replied Mrs Miller.

385
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,850
'Daisy loves Rome.

386
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,780
The society is splendid.

387
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,900
She's invited to many people's houses.

388
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,190
She goes out much more frequently than I do.

389
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,950
And she knows a lot of gentlemen here.

390
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,059
Yes, she loves Rome.

391
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:15,390
Of course, young ladies are always happier
in a place if they know a lot of gentlemen

392
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,080
there.'

393
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,900
Daisy had been talking to Mrs Walker, but
now she turned to Winterbourne and said, 'I've

394
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,630
been telling Mrs Walker how horrible you were
to me in Vevey.'

395
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,690
Winterbourne was rather irritated.

396
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,990
She did not seem to appreciate the fact that
he had travelled from Geneva without stopping

397
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:40,560
at Bologna or Florence, simply because he
was impatient to see her.

398
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,289
He remembered an American friend of his who
had told him that American women - the pretty

399
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:50,060
ones - were the most demanding and least grateful
women in the world.

400
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,429
'My dear young lady!'

401
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:54,510
cried Winterbourne.

402
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:00,270
'Have I come all the way to Rome just to hear
you criticise me?'

403
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,110
But Daisy ignored him.

404
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,610
She turned back to Mrs Walker and said, 'Thank
you for inviting us to your party.

405
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,070
We gladly accept the invitation.'

406
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,440
'I'm delighted to hear it,' replied Mrs Walker.

407
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,270
'I've got a lovely dress.'

408
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,929
'I'm very sure of that.'

409
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:22,690
'But I want to ask you a favour: can I please
bring a friend?'

410
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,060
'Certainly,' said Mrs Walker, smiling at Mrs
Miller.

411
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,400
'Any friend of yours is welcome.'

412
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,210
'Oh, they're not my friends,' said Mrs Miller
with a nervous smile.

413
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,950
'I've never met them!'

414
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,440
'He's a very close friend of mine,' said Daisy.

415
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,090
'Mr Giovanelli.'

416
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,700
Mrs Walker was silent for a moment.

417
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:52,480
She looked quickly at Winterbourne then said,
'Mr Giovanelli is welcome to come to the party.'

418
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,280
'He's an Italian,' continued Daisy serenely.

419
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,390
'He's the most handsome man in the world,
except for Mr Winterbourne.

420
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,590
He knows lots of Italians, but he wants to
meet some Americans.

421
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,049
He's very clever and perfectly lovely!'

422
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,610
'Daisy,' said Mrs Miller.

423
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,809
'It's time to go back to the hotel.'

424
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,500
'You go,' Daisy replied with a smile.

425
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,490
'I'm going to the Pincio for a walk.'

426
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,070
'She's going to walk with Mr Giovanelli,'
said Randolph.

427
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,419
'Alone, my dear?' asked Mrs Walker.

428
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,580
'And at this hour?

429
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,090
I don't think it's safe.'

430
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,900
'Neither do I,' said Mrs Miller.

431
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,570
'You'll get the fever!'

432
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,730
'I'm not going alone,' said Daisy to Mrs Walker.

433
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,790
'I'm going with the beautiful Mr Giovanelli.'

434
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,990
'My dear young friend,' said Mrs Walker.

435
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,620
'Don't go to the Pincio at this hour to meet
a beautiful Italian.'

436
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,470
'Oh!' said Daisy.

437
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,840
'I don't want to do anything improper.

438
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,220
Perhaps Mr Winterbourne will walk to the Pincio
with me.

439
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,970
That'll solve the problem.'

440
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:10,950
Winterbourne agreed, and they walked together
down the stairs and past Mrs Miller's carriage,

441
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,180
in which Eugenio was waiting.

442
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,100
'Goodbye, Eugenio,' cried Daisy.

443
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,300
'I'm going for a walk.'

444
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,270
CHAPTER FIVE
Introducing Mr Giovanelli

445
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,419
As they walked, Daisy told Winterbourne all
about her experiences in Rome.

446
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,150
'We have very beautiful rooms at the hotel,'
she said.

447
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,480
'We'll stay here all winter, unless we die
of the fever, and in that case we'll stay

448
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,270
even longer!

449
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,580
I'm enjoying Rome very much.

450
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,720
I know lots of charming people here...'

451
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:55,200
She talked like this for some time, then she
turned to him and asked, 'Why didn't you come

452
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,730
to visit me?'

453
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,169
'I've already told you,' Winterbourne replied.

454
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:03,510
'I've only just got off the train.'

455
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,539
'You must have stayed on the train a long
time after it stopped!' said Daisy, with a

456
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,340
little laugh.

457
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,169
'Anyway, you've had time to go and visit Mrs
Walker.'

458
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,740
'I know Mrs Walker from Geneva-'

459
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,540
'I know.

460
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,670
She told me.

461
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,240
Well, you know me from Vevey.

462
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,900
That's just as good.

463
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,700
So you ought to have come to visit me.'

464
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,600
When they reached the Pincio, Daisy saw Mr
Giovanelli.

465
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,950
He was standing by a tree, looking at the
women in their carriages.

466
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,799
He was a handsome little man, very elegantly
dressed, with a flower in his buttonhole.

467
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,510
'Are you going to speak to that man?' asked
Winterbourne.

468
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,980
'Of course!' said Daisy.

469
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,720
'Then I'm staying with you.'

470
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,700
Daisy stopped and looked at him for a moment
in silence, but the expression on her face

471
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,070
was still serene.

472
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,990
'I don't like the way you say that,' she said
with a smile, 'I never allow gentlemen to

473
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,990
tell me what to do.'

474
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,140
'I think you've made a mistake,' Winterbourne
replied.

475
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,720
'You should sometimes listen to a gentleman
- the right one.'

476
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,480
She looked at him again, more seriously this
time, with her pretty eyes, then she laughed

477
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,240
and said, 'I do nothing but listen to gentlemen!

478
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,070
Is Mr Giovanelli the right one?'

479
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,060
Just then, Giovanelli saw them and walked
up to them.

480
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,710
He had a brilliant smile and intelligent eyes.

481
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,630
'No, he isn't the right one,' said Winterbourne.

482
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,680
Daisy introduced Giovanelli to Winterbourne,
and they walked along, one gentleman on each

483
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,600
side of Daisy.

484
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,470
Mr Giovanelli spoke English very well.

485
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,220
He made pleasant conversation with Winterbourne
and Daisy.

486
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,539
He was disappointed that Daisy had not come
alone, but he did not show his disappointment.

487
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:02,960
'He's not a gentleman,' thought Winterbourne.

488
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,510
'He's a good imitation of one, but a nice
girl ought to know the difference!'

489
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,289
But was Miss Daisy Miller a nice girl?

490
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:14,050
That was the question.

491
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:20,000
She had no delicacy, and yet she did not seem
impatient for Winterbourne to go: she did

492
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,320
not seem to want to be alone with her lover.

493
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,820
She was a strange combination of audacity
and innocence.

494
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,630
Fifteen minutes later, Winterbourne noticed
Mrs Walker sitting in her carriage at the

495
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,440
side of the road.

496
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,100
She waved to him.

497
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,290
He left Miss Miller with Mr Giovanelli and
went to Mrs Walker, who looked agitated.

498
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,070
'This is terrible!' said Mrs Walker.

499
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,340
'That girl mustn't do this kind of thing.

500
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,150
She mustn't walk here with you two men.

501
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,900
Fifty people have noticed her!'

502
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,100
'Is it really that important?' asked Winterbourne.

503
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,150
'She's very innocent.'

504
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,740
'She's very crazy!'

505
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,030
cried Mrs Walker.

506
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,990
'And her mother is an absolute fool!

507
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:14,080
When you left, I thought that, since her mother
won't warn her, I should, so I came here to

508
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,830
find her.

509
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,660
Tell her I want to speak to her.'

510
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:24,120
'I don't think it's a good idea,' said Winterbourne,
'but you can try.'

511
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,590
When Winterbourne gave Daisy this message,
the young lady walked serenely to Mrs Walker's

512
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,640
carriage with Mr Giovanelli at her side.

513
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,680
'Mrs Walker, this is Mr Giovanelli,' said
Daisy prettily.

514
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,710
Mrs Walker nodded to the Italian then turned
to Daisy and said, 'Will you get in the carriage

515
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,960
and drive with me?'

516
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,900
'No, thank you,' said Daisy.

517
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,940
'I'm perfectly happy as I am.'

518
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,009
And she smiled at her two gentlemen.

519
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:59,820
'You may be perfectly happy, dear child, but
it isn't the custom here for a young lady

520
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,360
to walk alone with gentlemen.'

521
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,440
'Well, it ought to be!' said Daisy.

522
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,240
'I love walking!'

523
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,270
'You should walk with your mother, dear,'
said Mrs Walker.

524
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,620
'My mother never goes for a walk.

525
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,049
And I'm not five years old!'

526
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:20,270
'You're old enough to be more reasonable,'
said Mrs Walker.

527
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,080
'You're old enough, my dear Miss Miller, to
cause a scandal.'

528
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,409
'What do you mean?' asked Daisy, smiling intensely.

529
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,520
'Come into my carriage, and I'll explain it
to you,' Mrs Walker replied.

530
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,330
Daisy looked at Giovanelli then at Winterbourne.

531
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,190
'I don't think I want to know what you mean!'

532
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,470
She blushed, and Winterbourne thought she
was extremely pretty.

533
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,630
She looked at Winterbourne and said, 'Do you
think that - to save my reputation - I should

534
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,980
get into the carriage?'

535
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,500
Winterbourne blushed a little and hesitated.

536
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,230
It seemed so strange to hear her talk that
way of her 'reputation'.

537
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,570
He wanted to give the reply that was best
for Daisy herself.

538
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,711
He felt that it was in Daisy's best interest
to hear the truth, and the truth, Winterbourne

539
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:16,320
thought, was that she should do what Mrs Walker
had asked her to do.

540
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,760
He looked at her exquisite prettiness and
then said, very gently, 'I think you should

541
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,360
get into the carriage'.

542
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,710
Daisy gave a violent laugh.

543
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,429
'How ridiculous!

544
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:34,080
If this is improper, Mrs Walker, then I am
improper.

545
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,110
Goodbye!'

546
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,850
Then she turned and walked away with Mr Giovanelli.

547
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,159
Mrs Walker watched her go with tears in her
eyes.

548
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,799
'Get in the carriage,' she said to Winterbourne.

549
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,419
'I think I should accompany Miss Miller.'

550
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,559
'If you don't get into this carriage, I'll
never speak to you again!'

551
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,800
cried Mrs Walker.

552
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,299
Winterbourne said goodbye to Daisy and Giovanelli
and got into the carriage.

553
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,909
'That wasn't very clever of you,' he said.

554
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:11,190
'I'm not trying to be clever; I'm trying to
be honest,' replied Mrs Walker.

555
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,550
'She's causing a great scandal.

556
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,960
Italian men come to see her at her hotel late
at night, when her mother has already gone

557
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,399
to bed.'

558
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,350
'She's just unsophisticated,' said Winterbourne
impatiently.

559
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,590
'She has no natural delicacy,' replied Mrs
Walker.

560
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,110
'You must stop seeing her, stop flirting with
her: leave her alone!'

561
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,440
'I can't do that.

562
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,419
I like her very much.'

563
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:45,330
'Then you should want to protect her from
scandal.'

564
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,770
Winterbourne got out of the carriage and said
goodbye to Mrs Walker.

565
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:56,020
He saw Daisy and Giovanelli standing by the
wall, looking at the beautiful Villa Borghese.

566
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,510
Giovanelli took Daisy's parasol and opened
it.

567
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:05,460
He rested the parasol on her shoulder so that
both their heads were hidden behind it.

568
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:14,609
Winterbourne hesitated a moment, then he turned
and walked away, towards his aunt's house.

569
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:19,740
CHAPTER SIX
Mrs Walker's party

570
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,830
Mrs Walker's party was a few days later.

571
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,010
Mrs Miller came alone.

572
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,940
The poor lady was very nervous.

573
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,700
'I've never been to a party alone before,
especially in this country!'

574
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:40,720
she told Mrs Walker, 'I wanted to bring Randolph
or Eugenio, but Daisy told me to go alone!'

575
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,801
'Is your daughter going to favour us with
her company?' asked Mrs Walker, but Mrs Miller

576
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:49,300
did not notice her sarcasm.

577
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,420
'Well, she's dressed for the party.

578
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,940
She got dressed before dinner.

579
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,260
But her friend is there - the Italian gentleman.

580
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,550
Daisy's playing the piano and Mr Giovanelli's
singing.

581
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,619
He sings splendidly.

582
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,990
But I think they'll come soon,' said Mrs Miller
hopefully.

583
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:14,090
Mrs Walker turned to Winterbourne and said,
'This is horrible!

584
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,460
Miss Miller is trying to punish me for criticising
her in the Pincio the other day.

585
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,050
When she comes, I won't speak to her!'

586
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,540
Daisy came after eleven o'clock.

587
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,490
'I'm sorry I'm late,' she said to Mrs Walker
with a smile.

588
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,990
'Mr Giovanelli and I were practicing his songs
so that he can sing for your guests.

589
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,820
He has such a beautiful voice.'

590
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,339
Daisy looked very lovely as she said this
in her sweet, bright voice.

591
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:44,600
'Is there anyone here I know?'

592
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,170
she asked, looking around with interest at
the other guests.

593
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,440
'I think everyone knows who you are!' said
Mrs Walker coldly.

594
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Mr Giovanelli sang his songs very well, although
no one had asked him to do so.

595
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,660
Daisy talked as he sang.

596
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,520
'I'd love to dance,' she said to Winterbourne,
'but these rooms are too small.'

597
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,619
'I don't want to dance,' Winterbourne replied.

598
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,230
'I can't dance.'

599
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,180
'Of course you can't dance; you're too stiff.'
said Miss Daisy.

600
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,770
'I hope you enjoyed your ride in Mrs Walker's
carriage.'

601
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,610
'No, I didn't enjoy it.

602
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,950
I preferred walking with you.'

603
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,240
'You went with your friend, and I went with
mine.

604
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,470
That was much better.

605
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,640
But really, Mrs Walker has such strange ideas!'

606
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
continued Daisy.

607
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,520
'How could I get into her carriage and leave
poor Mr Giovanelli?'

608
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,830
'Mr Giovanelli was wrong to ask you to walk
with him.

609
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,790
No young Italian lady walks with gentlemen
in the streets.'

610
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,660
'In the streets?'

611
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,740
cried Daisy.

612
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,790
'The Pincio is not "the streets"!

613
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,099
And fortunately I'm not a young Italian lady!

614
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:05,550
It seems to me they have a miserable time!'

615
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,849
'People here think you're a flirt,' said Winterbourne
seriously.

616
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,150
'Of course I am!' said Daisy with a smile.

617
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,070
'All nice girls are flirts!

618
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,950
But I suppose you'll say that I'm not a nice
girl.'

619
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:26,570
'You're a very nice girl,' said Winterbourne,
'but I want you to flirt with me and nobody

620
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,570
else.'

621
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,040
'Thank you!'

622
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
replied Daisy.

623
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,330
'But I don't want to flirt with you: you're
too stiff!'

624
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,330
'Well, at least stop flirting with Giovanelli.

625
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,130
They don't understand that sort of thing here.'

626
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:46,099
'I thought they understood nothing else!'
said Daisy.

627
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,070
'Not in young unmarried women.'

628
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:55,260
'It seems to me much more proper in young
unmarried women than in old married ones,'

629
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,770
cried Daisy.

630
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:02,240
'Well,' said Winterbourne, 'you must obey
the customs of the place.

631
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,460
Flirting is a purely American custom; it doesn't
exist here.

632
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:14,609
So when you go out in public with Mr Giovanelli
and without your mother, people are shocked.'

633
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,580
'Poor Mother!' said Daisy.

634
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:23,230
'You are flirting, but Mr Giovanelli isn't:
he's quite serious.'

635
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,609
'At least he doesn't tell me what to do!'

636
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:27,230
cried Daisy.

637
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,220
'Anyway, I'm not flirting with Mr Giovanelli.

638
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,740
We're good friends, very intimate friends.'

639
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,200
'Ah,' replied Winterbourne, 'it's different
if you're in love with each other.'

640
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,690
To Winterbourne's surprise, Daisy blushed
and stood up angrily.

641
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,320
'At least Mr Giovanelli never says such horrible
things!'

642
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,490
she cried.

643
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,480
Daisy spent the rest of the evening sitting
with Mr Giovanelli in a quiet corner of the

644
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,830
room.

645
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:03,270
When she came back to say goodbye to Mrs Walker,
the lady ignored her.

646
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,470
Daisy went pale and looked anxiously at her
mother.

647
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,550
Winterbourne felt very sorry for her.

648
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:15,930
'That was very cruel,' he said to Mrs Walker,
after Daisy had left.

649
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,670
'I'll never invite her here again!'

650
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,770
Mrs Walker replied.

651
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,720
In the weeks that followed, Winterbourne often
went to visit Daisy at her hotel.

652
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,650
Giovanelli was always there, but Daisy did
not seem disturbed by Winterbourne's presence.

653
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,730
It seemed that she could talk as happily with
one gentleman or two.

654
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,670
One Sunday afternoon, Winterbourne went to
St Peter's with his aunt.

655
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:48,750
When he saw Daisy and Giovanelli walking together
in the great church, he said to his aunt,

656
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,079
'There's Miss Miller!'

657
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,690
Mrs Costello looked at Daisy for a moment
then said, 'Is that what makes you so distracted

658
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,760
these days?'

659
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,740
'I'm not distracted,' replied Winterbourne.

660
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,790
'You seem very preoccupied: you're thinking
of something.'

661
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,290
'And what do you think I'm thinking of?'

662
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:18,580
'Of Miss Miller's intimacy with that ridiculous
Italian,' said Mrs Costello, indicating Giovanelli.

663
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:23,820
'I don't think it's an "intimacy" in the sense
you mean.'

664
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,200
'Everyone else does.

665
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,990
He's very handsome, and she's very vulgar.

666
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,680
She thinks he's the most elegant gentleman
in the world.

667
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,910
He's even better than the courier!

668
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,940
The courier probably introduced them, and
when they're married this man will give the

669
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,020
courier a lot of money.

670
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,950
Yes, I see how it is.'

671
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:50,740
'I don't believe she's thinking of marrying
him,' said Winterbourne, 'and I don't think

672
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,730
he hopes to marry her.'

673
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:58,500
'She's so vulgar that she probably doesn't
think at all,' said Mrs Costello.

674
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,180
'But believe me, very soon she'll tell you
that she's engaged.'

675
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,599
'I don't think so,' Winterbourne replied.

676
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,359
'I've asked some questions about him.

677
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,850
He's a perfectly respectable little man, but
he's not from the best Italian society.

678
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:24,320
He has no money and no title - he's not a
count or a marchese - so he knows that he

679
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,380
cannot hope to marry her.

680
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,810
He probably doesn't realise that Daisy and
her mother aren't sophisticated enough to

681
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,369
want to catch a count or a marchese.'

682
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:40,460
'He thinks he can win her with his handsome
face,' said Mrs Costello.

683
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,980
'No,' replied Winterbourne.

684
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:49,500
'He knows that he has nothing but his handsome
face, and he knows that Mr Miller, in the

685
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,570
mysterious land of dollars, will want his
daughter to marry someone with more than that.'

686
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,610
Some of Mrs Costello's American friends joined
them then, and Winterbourne heard a lot of

687
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:04,980
talk about the scandalous Miss Daisy Miller.

688
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,910
He felt sorry for her.

689
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:12,720
He was sorry to hear them talking about her
like that: to him she seemed just pretty and

690
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,790
unprotected and natural.

691
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,890
CHAPTER SEVEN
Innocent or Immoral?

692
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:30,430
A few days later, Winterbourne went to see
Mrs Miller at her hotel, hoping to persuade

693
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,920
her to take better care of her daughter.

694
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,740
'I'm sorry, Daisy isn't here,' said Mrs Miller.

695
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,730
'She's gone somewhere with Mr Giovanelli.

696
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,089
She's always going somewhere with Mr Giovanelli.'

697
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:47,760
'I've noticed that they're very intimate,'
said Winterbourne.

698
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,830
'Oh!

699
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,790
It seems as if they couldn't live without
each other!' said Mrs Miller.

700
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,170
'Well, at least he's a real gentleman.

701
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,400
I keep telling Daisy that she's engaged!'

702
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,680
'And what does Daisy say?'

703
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,940
'Oh, she says she isn't engaged, but she acts
as if she is!

704
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:15,849
I asked Mr Giovanelli to tell me if they get
engaged, so that I can write and tell Mr Miller.'

705
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:20,590
Winterbourne had never heard a parent speak
of a daughter's behaviour in such a distant

706
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,920
way.

707
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,530
He found Mrs Miller's attitude so strange
and confusing that he gave up the idea of

708
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,560
warning her.

709
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:36,230
After that, Winterbourne noticed that Daisy
was no longer invited to people's houses.

710
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,800
Society had decided that Miss Daisy Miller
had gone too far.

711
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,390
How did she feel about that?

712
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:49,120
Sometimes he thought she did not care: she
was too childish and superficial to notice

713
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,470
what people thought of her.

714
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,711
At other moments he thought she knew perfectly
well the impression she produced, but she

715
00:44:56,711 --> 00:45:01,490
refused to change because she knew that she
was innocent.

716
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:07,400
But then he thought perhaps she refused to
change because she was irresponsible.

717
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,850
It was becoming more and more difficult for
him to believe in her innocence.

718
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:18,430
He was angry with himself because he could
not decide what kind of young lady Miss Daisy

719
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,230
Miller was.

720
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,599
He had no idea whether her eccentricities
were personal or national.

721
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,890
By not inviting her to their parties, the
other American residents in Rome were sending

722
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:36,060
a clear message to their Italian friends,
who were all aristocrats.

723
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,619
They were telling the Italians that, though
Miss Daisy Miller was an American young lady,

724
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:43,980
she was not typical.

725
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,630
So perhaps Daisy's eccentricities were purely
personal.

726
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,020
But was she innocent or immoral?

727
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,099
Did she understand the consequences of her
actions, or was she ignorant of them?

728
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:03,320
Was she simply a child, or was she a rebellious
young woman?

729
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,640
One day, he met her in the Palace of the Caesars.

730
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,710
She was walking through the flowers in the
beautiful deserted gardens with Mr Giovanelli.

731
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,430
'Aren't you lonely?' asked Daisy.

732
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,430
'Lonely?'

733
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,430
'Yes.

734
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,010
You're always walking around alone.

735
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:24,849
Can't you find anyone to walk with you?'

736
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:29,930
'I'm not as fortunate as your companion,'
replied Winterbourne.

737
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:35,410
From the first, Giovanelli had treated Winterbourne
with great courtesy and respect.

738
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:40,480
He had listened to Winterbourne s conversation
and laughed whenever Winterbourne said something

739
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,080
amusing.

740
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,369
He gave the impression that he considered
Winterbourne a superior young man.

741
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,000
He did not act like a jealous lover.

742
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,140
Obviously, Giovanelli was very diplomatic.

743
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,000
He did not mind showing a little humility
in front of the American.

744
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,350
At times, it even seemed to Winterbourne that
Giovanelli wanted to talk to him privately

745
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:10,880
- to explain that of course he, Giovanelli,
knew that this young lady was too good for

746
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,270
him.

747
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,380
On this occasion, he walked away from his
companions and went to pick some flowers for

748
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,860
his buttonhole.

749
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,480
'I know why you say that,' said Daisy.

750
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,080
'You think I spend too much time with Mr Giovanelli.'

751
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,270
'Everyone thinks so.'

752
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,830
'They don't really care what I do,' Daisy
replied.

753
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:36,440
'Oh yes, they do, and they'll be very unpleasant
to you.

754
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,099
They're already being unpleasant to you.

755
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:41,089
Haven't you noticed?'

756
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:43,599
'I've noticed you,' said Daisy.

757
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,770
'But I noticed that you were very stiff and
conventional the first time I saw you!'

758
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:53,349
'I'm not as stiff as some of the others,'
said Winterbourne, smiling.

759
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:57,710
'Haven't you noticed that they don't invite
you to their houses anymore?'

760
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:01,120
'Why do you let people be so unkind?'

761
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,200
cried Daisy.

762
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,020
'What can I do?'

763
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,420
replied Winterbourne.

764
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,380
'You could say something to them.'

765
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,260
'I do say something.

766
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,730
I say that your mother thinks you're engaged.'

767
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,650
'Well, she does,' said Daisy very simply.

768
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,869
'And does Randolph believe it?' asked Winterbourne,
laughing.

769
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,420
'I don't know.

770
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:29,040
I don't think he believes anything,' she replied,
'and since you've mentioned it, I am engaged.'

771
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,410
Winterbourne stopped laughing and looked at
her in surprise.

772
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,430
'You don't believe it!'

773
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,060
cried Daisy.

774
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,470
He was silent a moment and then said, 'Yes,
I believe it.'

775
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,829
'Oh no, you don't!'

776
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,060
she replied.

777
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:51,560
'Well, then - I'm not!'

778
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,060
CHAPTER EIGHT
A night at the Golosseum

779
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,550
A week later, Winterbourne was walking home
alone at eleven o'clock at night after dinner

780
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,450
with friends.

781
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:06,960
He decided to go into the Colosseum.

782
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,710
Outside, he noticed a carriage was waiting.

783
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,540
He walked into the silent arena in the moonlight.

784
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,170
One half of the gigantic circus was in the
shadow.

785
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:23,700
The place had never seemed more splendid,
and he remembered Byron's famous lines.

786
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:31,520
But then he thought, 'The poets love the Colosseum
by night, but the doctors say it's dangerous

787
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,609
because of the risk of getting malaria.

788
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,990
I should go soon.'

789
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,990
As he walked towards the great cross in the
centre of the arena, he saw that two people

790
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,120
were on the steps at its base.

791
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,490
One, a woman, was sitting on a step; her companion
was standing beside her.

792
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,170
Then Winterbourne heard the woman's voice:
'He looks at us as one of those old lions

793
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:59,119
must have looked at the Christians!'

794
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,940
It was the voice of Miss Daisy Miller.

795
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:09,060
'Let's hope he's not very hungry,' Giovanelli
replied with a laugh.

796
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,300
Winterbourne stopped.

797
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,890
He felt a combination of horror and relief.

798
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:19,840
Now at last he knew what to think of Miss
Daisy Miller: she was not a respectable young

799
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,840
lady.

800
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:26,220
He felt angry with himself for having spent
so much time trying to decide what to think

801
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,569
of her.

802
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:34,619
He turned to walk out of the Colosseum, but
then she spoke again: 'It's Mr Winterbourne!

803
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:38,089
He saw me, and he didn't say hello!'

804
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,430
How cleverly she played the part of the innocent!

805
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,880
But he could not just ignore her.

806
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,300
As he walked towards the great cross, Daisy
stood up and Giovanelli raised his hat.

807
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,880
Winterbourne now began to think how crazy
she was to be there.

808
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:59,550
A delicate young girl should not spend the
evening in the Colosseum: she might get Roman

809
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,260
fever.

810
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:08,099
'It's now clear,' thought Winterbourne, 'that
she's an immoral young woman, but even so

811
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,410
I don't want her to die of malaria.'

812
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:16,960
'How long have you been here?' he asked angrily.

813
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,510
Daisy, lovely in the moonlight, looked at
him for a moment then said gently, 'We've

814
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,680
been here all evening.

815
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,569
Isn't it pretty?'

816
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:29,880
'You could get malaria!

817
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,900
You won't think that's pretty!'

818
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,390
cried Winterbourne.

819
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,880
Then, turning to Giovanelli, he's said, 'You're
a Roman.

820
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,450
You know about Roman fever.

821
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,859
Why did you bring her here?'

822
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:48,640
'Ah,' said the handsome Roman, 'I'm not afraid
of getting malaria myself.'

823
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,000
'But what about this young lady?'

824
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,800
'I told the Signorina that it was dangerous,
but she's never cautious.'

825
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,440
'I've never been ill a day in my life!' said
Daisy.

826
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,460
'I wanted to see the Colosseum by moonlight,
and we've had a lovely time.

827
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,820
When I get home, Eugenio will give me some
of his medicine against malaria.

828
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,630
He has some splendid pills.'

829
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,440
'Well, go home now and take one!'

830
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,930
cried Winterbourne.

831
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,400
Giovanelli went out to find the carriage.

832
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,560
Daisy followed with Winterbourne.

833
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,010
She did not seem at all embarrassed.

834
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:31,380
She talked about the beauty of the place and
how glad she was to seen it by moonlight.

835
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,900
Then she noticed that Winterbourne was silent.

836
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,490
'Why are you so quiet?'

837
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,230
she asked.

838
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,170
Winterbourne did not reply but began to laugh.

839
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,020
'Did you believe that I was engaged the other
day?'

840
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,900
she asked.

841
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,760
'It doesn't matter what I believed the other
day?'

842
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,310
replied Winterbourne, still laughing.

843
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:57,459
'Now I believe it makes very little difference
whether you're engaged or not!'

844
00:52:57,459 --> 00:53:01,540
Daisy looked at him, but in the darkness he
could not see her face.

845
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,849
Then Giovanelli came to say that the carriage
was ready.

846
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:10,460
'Don't forget to take Eugenio's pills!' said
Winterbourne.

847
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,589
Daisy replied in a trembling voice, 'I don't
care whether I get Roman fever or not!'

848
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:23,480
Then she got into the carriage, and it drove
off.

849
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,240
CHAPTER NINE
Daisy becomes ill

850
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,450
Winterbourne told no one that he had met Miss
Miller at eleven o'clock in the Colosseum

851
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,200
with a gentleman.

852
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:41,890
Nevertheless, two days later, all the American
residents in Rome knew about it and were talking

853
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:45,750
about 'the little American flirt'.

854
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,220
Winterbourne found that he no longer cared
that people were saying unkind things about

855
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,130
Daisy Miller.

856
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,810
Then he heard that Daisy was very ill.

857
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,170
He went to the hotel to ask how she was.

858
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:03,531
There he met three other visitors who said
that Daisy was dangerously ill: she had a

859
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,250
terrible case of malaria.

860
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:12,190
He did not see Mrs Miller: finally that lady
was where she should always have been - at

861
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,849
her daughter's side.

862
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:18,790
Winterbourne went to the hotel often to ask
for news of Daisy.

863
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,099
One time he saw Mrs Miller.

864
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:25,000
'Daisy spoke of you the other day,' said Daisy's
mother.

865
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,300
'Half the time she's delirious from the fever
and she doesn't know what she's saying, but

866
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,170
that time I think she did.

867
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:38,109
She told me to tell you that she was never
engaged to that handsome Italian.

868
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:44,750
I was very glad to hear that: Mr Giovanelli
hasn't been to see us since she got ill.

869
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,819
A lady told me that he's afraid that I'm angry
with him for taking Daisy out at night.

870
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:57,579
Well, I am angry with him, but I'm a lady:
even when I'm angry I can be polite to guests.

871
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:01,200
Anyway, Daisy said she's not engaged.

872
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,700
I don't know why she wanted you to know.

873
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,329
She told me three times.

874
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:09,369
"Be sure to tell Mr Winterbourne" she said.

875
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:15,410
And then she told me to ask if you remember
the time you went to that castle in Switzerland.'

876
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,680
A week later, the poor girl died.

877
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,730
Daisy's grave was in the little Protestant
cemetery by the wall of imperial Rome, beneath

878
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,710
the cypress trees and the spring flowers.

879
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:32,010
Winterbourne was surprised by the number of
people present at the funeral.

880
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:37,760
Many people who had been unkind to her when
she was alive came to pay their last respects

881
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,420
now that she was dead.

882
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,180
Giovanelli stood near Winterbourne.

883
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,030
He was very pale.

884
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,450
On this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole.

885
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:54,420
When the funeral was over, Giovanelli turned
to Winterbourne and said, 'She was the most

886
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,690
beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the nicest.'

887
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:06,040
He was silent for a moment, then he said,
'And she was the most innocent.'

888
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,950
Winterbourne looked at him then repeated his
words, 'And the most innocent?'

889
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,859
'The most innocent!'

890
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:17,470
Winterbourne felt very angry.

891
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:23,599
'Why the devil,' he asked, 'did you take her
to that fatal place?'

892
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,330
Mr Giovanelli was silent for a moment, then
he said, 'I had no fear for myself, and she

893
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,839
wanted to go.'

894
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,180
'That's no reason!'

895
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,930
cried Winterbourne.

896
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:42,210
Giovanelli was silent again, and then he said,
'She didn't want to marry me.

897
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:47,420
For a while I hoped, but now I'm sure that
she didn't want to.'

898
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,880
Winterbourne listened to him.

899
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,880
He looked down at the new grave surrounded
by April flowers.

900
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,410
When he looked up again, Mr Giovanelli had
gone.

901
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,980
Winterbourne left Rome soon afterwards.

902
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:06,260
In the months that followed, he often thought
about Daisy Miller and her mysterious manners.

903
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,800
The following summer, he went to see his aunt
Mrs Costello in Vevey.

904
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,180
One day he spoke to her about Daisy.

905
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:17,040
'I think I treated her unfairly,' he said.

906
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,640
'She sent me a message before her death which
I didn't understand at the time.

907
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,069
But I have thought about it since, and now
I understand.

908
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:30,730
She wanted me to respect her.'

909
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:38,849
'Is that a modest way of saying she wanted
you to love her?' asked Mrs Costello.

910
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:41,520
Winterbourne did not reply to this question.

911
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,849
After a short silence, he continued: 'What
you said last summer was true: I did make

912
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:50,059
a great mistake.

913
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:52,670
I've lived too long in foreign countries.'

914
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,900
Nevertheless, he went back to Geneva.

915
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,720
His friends say that he is 'studying' there.

916
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,640
Other people say that he is interested in
a very clever foreign lady.

917
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,360
- THE END -
