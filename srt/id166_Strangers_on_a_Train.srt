CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,920
The First Meeting
The train rushed along angrily. Guy was thinking

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:21,160
about Miriam. He saw her round pink face,
her cruel mouth... he started to hate her.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:28,279
'Perhaps Miriam doesn't want a divorce,' Guy
thought unhappily. 'But she's pregnant and

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:36,809
it's not my child, and she must want to marry
the father. Why does she want to see me, though?

6
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:44,629
She can get a divorce without that. Perhaps
she doesn't want a divorce, only money.'

7
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,969
Miriam sometimes asked him for money and he
always sent it because she was good at making

8
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:58,180
trouble and Guy didn't want his mother to
be unhappy. In Metcalf, Guy's home town, Miriam

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,230
pretended that Guy lived in New York so he
could succeed as an architect before he sent

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,830
for her.

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,920
Guy thought about his girlfriend Anne and
how much he loved her, and about the important

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:22,700
job he had in Florida. He felt happy. 'Soon...'
Guy said to himself. 'Soon...' He started

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,180
to read his book.

14
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,719
After he had read half a page Guy looked up
and saw a young man sitting opposite him.

15
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:39,150
The young man was very tall and thin, and
he smiled shyly at Guy as if he did not know

16
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,659
whether to speak or not. Guy moved in his
seat and accidentally touched the young man's

17
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,930
foot.

18
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,240
'Sorry,' Guy said.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,149
'That's all right,' the man said. 'Say, where
are we? Do you know?'

20
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,000
'Texas.'

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,270
The young man took a small bottle of whisky
from his pocket and offered it to Guy with

22
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:13,940
a friendly smile. He had a very large head,
his face did not look stupid or intelligent,

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:23,290
or young or old. His eyes were red and tired,
but his skin was as smooth as a girl's.

24
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,489
'No, thanks,' Guy said.

25
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:34,459
The young man drank some of the whisky, then
he asked, very politely, 'Where are you going?'

26
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,420
'Metcalf.' Guy wanted to read his book.

27
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,500
'Nice town, Metcalf,' the young man said.
'Are you going on business?'

28
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,739
'Er, yes.' Guy turned the page of his book.

29
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,700
'What business?' the young man asked, like
a child.

30
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,340
'I'm an architect.'

31
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:05,120
'That's interesting,' he said. He put his
hand forward. 'My name's Bruno, Charles Anthony

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,840
Bruno.'

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,940
Guy shook his hand. 'Guy Haines,' he said.

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,640
'Do you live in New York, Guy?' Bruno asked.

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,650
'Yes I do.'

36
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,959
'I live on Long Island,' Bruno said. 'I'm
going to Santa Fe on holiday.'

37
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,280
Guy wanted to read, or to think, but he could
feel this man who wanted to talk all the time

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,750
looking at him. The train stopped and Guy
took a walk outside for some fresh air, but

39
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:47,569
it wasn't fresh, it was hot and thick. He
went back to the train for some dinner.

40
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:55,790
'Hello!' Bruno sat down at Guy's table. 'Look,
I've got a private room. Have dinner with

41
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,829
me, that'll be nice.'

42
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,439
'No, thanks. I...' Guy said.

43
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:11,050
'Yes!' Bruno said. He stood up quickly. He
seemed drunk. He ordered dinner for two in

44
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,350
his private room, then he walked away, stepping
carefully.

45
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:24,020
Guy followed him. 'Why not?' he thought. 'He's
someone to talk to.'

46
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,950
Bruno's room was very untidy. There were clothes,
magazines, cigarettes, chocolates everywhere

47
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,610
on the floor and the seats. In the middle
of the floor Guy saw four big bottles of whisky

48
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:45,560
in a straight line. A waiter brought dinner
and they started to eat, and to drink the

49
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
whisky.

50
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,200
'What are you going to build in Metcalf, Guy?'
Bruno asked, his mouth full of food.

51
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,790
'Nothing,' Guy said. 'My mother lives in Metcalf,
it's my home.'

52
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,270
Bruno stopped eating. 'Do you like your mother,
Guy?'

53
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,300
'Yes.'

54
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,380
'Your father, too?'

55
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,070
'He's dead,' Guy said.

56
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:23,120
'Oh. Yeah, I like my mother, too,' Bruno said.
'She's coming to Santa Fe. We do everything

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,070
together.' Bruno stopped suddenly. 'Do you
think that's strange?'

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,570
'No,' Guy said.

59
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,461
'Mother gives me money,' Bruno said. He lit
a cigarette and drank more whisky. 'Father

60
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:47,300
never gives me anything. He's rich, too!'
Bruno shouted. 'I want my own money!'

61
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,030
Then Bruno laughed. 'Father would like you,
Guy. You're good and quiet, and you've got

62
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:02,020
a good job, too. Me? I don't want to work.
Why should I? I don't feel like it.' Bruno

63
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:11,940
laughed again. 'Father wants me to go into
his business. Like Hell I will!' Bruno pushed

64
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,320
his cigarette into the dish of butter next
to his plate. 'He never gives me money - I

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:28,750
know he doesn't like me. I don't like him.
You know, Guy, sometimes, I could kill him.'

66
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:35,970
Bruno looked at Guy. 'Did you ever want to
murder someone, Guy?'

67
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:42,830
Guy wasn't listening, he was thinking about
Anne and Miriam and Florida. It was all mixed

68
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,680
up in his head.

69
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,830
'Tell me about you, Guy,' Bruno asked. 'What
kind of things do you build?'

70
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:59,750
'What?' Guy tried to think. 'Oh, houses, offices...'

71
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,060
Are you married, Guy?'

72
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:12,040
'No. Yes. Er, well, I'm separated. I left
three years ago,' Guy said. He didn't want

73
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,470
to tell Bruno these things.

74
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,700
'Oh? Why is that, Guy?'

75
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,500
'I think we were too young'

76
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:27,190
'Do you love her?' Bruno's eyes weren't tired
now. They were bright and looked straight

77
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,190
at Guy. 'You take love seriously, don't you,
Guy?'

78
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,540
Guy didn't answer this.

79
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,310
'What kind of girl is your wife?' Bruno asked.

80
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:50,300
'She's pretty, red hair, a little fat,' Guy
said. 'We're going to get a divorce,' he said.

81
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:57,450
'Why? Why now? Why not before?' Bruno's eyes
were very bright.

82
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:03,280
'She's pregnant,' Guy said. He didn't like
saying it.

83
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,840
'Oh, boy!' Bruno said. 'I hate women like
that, don't you?'

84
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,940
'Well, no... I,' Guy said. 'It happens.'

85
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:23,070
Bruno pulled the cigarette in and out of the
butter. 'Men go to women like her like flies

86
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,320
go to rubbish,' he said. 'What's her name?'

87
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:36,490
'Miriam, Miriam Joyce.' Guy tried to change
the subject. 'Well, Bruno,' he said. 'If you

88
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,940
don't want to work, what do you want to do?'

89
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:48,760
'I think a man needs to try everything once.
You know, everything - travel, and women,

90
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:56,080
and, uh, robbery... and murder.' He stopped
and looked at Guy with a worried face. 'Did

91
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,510
you ever want to kill someone, Guy?'

92
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,740
'No.' Guy was starting to feel drunk.

93
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,260
Bruno picked up another bottle of whisky and
tried to open it. 'You know, Guy, the police

94
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,311
don't catch most murderers.' He was very drunk
and the top of the bottle flew off. Whisky

95
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,480
went all over the floor.

96
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
'Really?' Guy said.

97
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:31,100
'No, they don't.' Bruno drank from the bottle.
'Come to Santa Fe with me, Guy! I like you!'

98
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:38,300
'I can't,' Guy said 'After Metcalf, I have
to go to Florida. I'm going to build a sports

99
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,900
club there.'

100
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:48,560
'Oh, Guy!' Bruno looked at him the way a little
boy looks at his father. 'That's great. You

101
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,550
must be very good.'

102
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,880
Guy smiled, 'Well, thanks'

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:03,020
'But,' Bruno said, 'if Miriam makes trouble
now - about the divorce - if she came to Florida,

104
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,890
Guy, well, you could lose the job, couldn't
you?'

105
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,090
Guy thought, 'That's the kind of thing Miriam
would do.'

106
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,420
'You could murder her for that, couldn't you,
Guy?'

107
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,100
'No,' he said.

108
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:26,120
'I could make a plan for murdering your wife,
Guy,' Bruno said. 'You might want to use it

109
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,500
some time.'

110
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,580
'No!'

111
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:36,990
'Oh, Guy!' Bruno stood up suddenly and waved
the bottle about. 'Oh!' he shouted. 'Guy!

112
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:45,370
I just thought. Oh, yes! You murder my father
and I'll murder Miriam. The police will never

113
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:56,930
find us. We're strangers, we met on a train
and nobody knows we're friends. It's perfect.'

114
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:04,160
Now the room was a little Hell. It was very
hot, Bruno's face was red and his mouth was

115
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,580
wide open, shouting, shouting.

116
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,980
'No, no!' Guy said. He ran out of the room,
then he opened one of the windows and breathed

117
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,410
in the cold night air.

118
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:27,670
'Guy?' Bruno stood behind him and put his
hand on Guy's back. 'I'm sorry.' Guy pulled

119
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:34,370
away from him. 'Oh, please, Guy.' He was like
a dog.

120
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,870
'It's all right,' Guy said. 'Let's forget
it.'

121
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,760
'OK, thanks.' Bruno smiled. 'Do you want another
drink?'

122
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,920
'No, I'm going to bed,' Guy said.

123
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,040
Before he went to sleep, Guy remembered that
his book was still in Bruno's room. He didn't

124
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,720
go back for it. He never wanted to see Bruno
again.

125
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,340
CHAPTER TWO
A Difficult Day with Miriam

126
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:15,740
When he got to Metcalf Guy phoned Miriam and
they met outside their old school. It was

127
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:23,160
a hot day and Miriam wore a big white hat.
Her face looked fatter than Guy remembered

128
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,450
and there were little lines under her eyes.

129
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,580
'Hello, Guy,' Miriam said and smiled, but
shut her little mouth quickly to hide her

130
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,670
bad front teeth. She looked soft and sticky.

131
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,960
'Hello, Miriam,' he said. 'How are you? When
will the child come?'

132
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,060
'January,' she said.

133
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:56,760
'She's two months' pregnant,' Guy thought.
He said, 'You must want to marry him... the

134
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,900
man?'

135
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,590
'You see,' she said, 'it's a bit difficult.'

136
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,410
'Difficult?'

137
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:13,890
'He's married, Guy.' Miriam was looking in
front of her, speaking as if he wasn't there.

138
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,700
'But we can still get divorced,' he said.

139
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,620
'Owen can't get divorced until September,
that's four months,' Miriam told him.

140
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,510
'We could get divorced now,' Guy said.

141
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:35,930
'Could we wait?' she asked. 'I think I'd like
to go away for a few months.'

142
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,860
'What do you mean?'

143
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:45,780
'Your mother told me about your job in Florida,'
Miriam said with her little smile. She looked

144
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:53,940
up at Guy with her dead eyes. 'I want to come
with you, and stay until December.'

145
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,220
'No,' he said. 'You can't do that.'

146
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,390
'If you don't take me with you, I'll come
alone,' she said.

147
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,339
'Then I won't take the job.'

148
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:15,070
'You won't do that,' she said in a hard voice.
'The job's too important.'

149
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,940
She loved arguing so Guy decided to be very
calm.

150
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,300
'Yes, Miriam, I will,' he said.

151
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,580
'Go on then,' she said. 'Run away from everything.'

152
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:37,450
He tried to talk to her. 'Is there anything
we can do about this, Miriam?' he asked.

153
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,330
'I've said what I want.'

154
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,330

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,100
When Guy got back to his mother's house he
found a letter from Anne:

156
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,500
What's happened? Write immediately, or phone.
I want to be with you. Why don't you come

157
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,410
to Mexico for a few days? Oh Guy, I'll miss
you when you're away in Florida, but I'm so

158
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:09,070
proud of you. Mum and Dad are, too. I know
everything will be all right soon.

159
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,130
All my love, Anne

160
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:18,750
After he read Anne's letter, Guy wrote to
Mr Brillhart at the sports' club in Florida

161
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,480
and said he could not take the job.

162
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,660
He spent the next day with his mother. That
night someone rang him on the phone.

163
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,899
'Hallo,' a man's voice said. 'It's Charley.'
He sounded drunk.

164
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,170
'Charley who?' Guy asked.

165
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,200
'Bruno! Charley Bruno!'

166
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,370
'Oh,' Guy said, 'Hello.'

167
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,000
'I've got your book, Guy,' Bruno said. 'Do
you want me to send it to you?'

168
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
'Yes.'

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,660
'Oh, I know,' Bruno said. 'Come to Santa Fe
and see me. Come now.'

170
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,330
'I can't,' Guy said.

171
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,980
'Okay. What about in Florida?' Bruno asked.
'I'll come and see you there. We'll have a

172
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,589
great time.'

173
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,730
'No,' Guy said. 'That's all finished.'

174
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:25,051
'Why?' Bruno asked. Then his voice changed.
'Your wife, huh? I know, she wanted to go

175
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,070
to Florida with you.'

176
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,130
This surprised Guy. How did Bruno know these
things so quickly?

177
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:41,120
'You can still get a divorce, can't you, Guy?'
Bruno asked. 'Guy?... Guy?'

178
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,410
'Look, I have to go,' Guy said.

179
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:56,731
'Guy, if you want me to do anything, you know,
do anything, all you have to do is say.' Bruno's

180
00:16:56,731 --> 00:17:00,850
voice was thick and slow with whisky now.

181
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:10,100
Guy remembered Bruno's plan. He said angrily,
'I don't want anything from you. Understand?'

182
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,510
'Oh, Guy!' Bruno started to cry.

183
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,530
Guy put the phone down.

184
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,679
CHAPTER THREE
Good News for Guy

185
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,910
Guy was walking with Anne in Mexico City.
In her long white dress and with her yellow

186
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,500
hair she seemed to be made of gold.

187
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:44,000
'But did you have to refuse the job in Florida
because of Miriam?' Anne asked.

188
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,510
'Yes. I hate her,' Guy said.

189
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:56,710
'Guy, you shouldn't hate people,' Anne said.
'You're talking like a child.'

190
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:03,480
He felt ashamed of what he said. Anne frightened
him when she spoke like this. She seemed so

191
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:12,390
far away from him. She was calm and rich and
clever and happy. Guy was not used to this.

192
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,929
Sometimes, when he was unhappy, Guy thought
he was the only problem in Anne's life.

193
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:25,300
They walked some more then Anne went back
to the Ritz Hotel where she was staying with

194
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:33,590
her parents. Guy went to his hotel. It was
an ugly place, but Guy liked it.

195
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,480
The next morning Guy got a telegram from his
mother:

196
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:48,530
Miriam lost her baby yesterday. She's very
sad and wants to see you. Can you come home?

197
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,330
Mama.

198
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,840
The first thing Guy did was to send a telegram
to Mr Brillhart to ask if he could have the

199
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,490
job again, then he rushed over to the Ritz
to see Anne. They had a drink in the bar at

200
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,600
the hotel.

201
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,490
'Are you going to Metcalf, Guy?' Anne asked.

202
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,870
'Not now, I'm too happy,' he told her.

203
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,330
'Do you think Miriam will follow you to Florida?'

204
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:28,210
Guy laughed. 'By this time next week,' he
said, 'Miriam will be nothing to me.'

205
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,670
CHAPTER FOUR
Bruno Gets Ready

206
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:40,280
Bruno sat in his mother's room at the Hotel
La Fonda in Sante Fe and watched her put cream

207
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,270
on her face.

208
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:49,130
'Charley,' she said, 'you won't do anything
stupid when I'm in California, will you?'

209
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:57,309
'No, Ma,' Bruno said. He felt sick and his
hands were shaking, but the idea was growing

210
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:06,950
stronger and stronger: 'I must kill Miriam
soon,' he thought, 'in the next few days or

211
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:15,200
it'll be too late. Guy's in Mexico, Mother's
going to California tomorrow, nobody in Metcalf

212
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,640
knows me. If Miriam died now, Guy could get
the Florida job back.'

213
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,010
'I need some money for tomorrow,' Bruno's
mother said. 'I hope your father sends some

214
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,010
soon.'

215
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,170
'That's all he's good for,' Bruno said. 'We
don't need him.'

216
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:45,160
She put her hand against his cheek. 'My dear,'
she said, 'I'll miss you.'

217
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:53,470
Bruno watched his mother walk into the bathroom.
She had great legs; he really liked them.

218
00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:01,670
He started thinking about the murder again.
It would be perfect, a pure, clean act. He

219
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:08,840
wanted to enjoy it. Perhaps Guy didn't want
to kill his father, but that wasn't important

220
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,060
now. Guy might do it when Miriam was dead.

221
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:21,811
Suddenly Bruno felt very unhappy. He could
never tell his mother. ('Hey, Ma, I murdered

222
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:27,951
this man's wife and then he killed Father.
It was my idea, too. Aren't I clever? We're

223
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:37,280
both free now!') No, he could never tell anyone,
except Guy.

224
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
***

225
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:45,460
Bruno tried to remember what day it was. Sunday,
that was it. The time was 8.10 in the morning.

226
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,860
He had plenty of time to get to Metcalf. He
still felt drunk after last night and he wanted

227
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:59,300
a clear head. He read the notes where he had
written everything he knew about Miriam. He

228
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:07,410
got out of bed slowly and walked very carefully
around the room. There was one way to get

229
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,410
better.

230
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,410
'I need a drink,' he said.

231
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,630
Outside the railway station Bruno went into
a bar and bought a small bottle of whisky.

232
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:28,220
'Bruno!' a man called. It was Wilson and his
friends. They were drunk, too.

233
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:34,080
'Hi, Wilson,' Bruno said. 'I can't talk. I
have to catch a train.'

234
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,299
'Where are you going?' Wilson asked.

235
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:42,190
'Tulsa. I'm going to Tulsa. I've got some
friends...'

236
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,920
Wilson wasn't listening. 'This is Joe,' he
said. 'And this is...'

237
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,220
'I've got to go,' Bruno said. 'Bye!'

238
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:00,500
Bruno got on the train quickly. Did they know
where he was going? No, they couldn't. The

239
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:09,900
train started towards Metcalf and Bruno fell
asleep before he could plan Miriam's murder.

240
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,429
CHAPTER FIVE
The First Murder

241
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:23,600
When he woke up Bruno felt better. His mind
was clear, he felt happy and he was hungry.

242
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,360
After a good dinner, he read the notes about
Miriam. What did she look like? She had red

243
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,690
hair, was a little fat, and she was pregnant.

244
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:42,850
'The dirty little...' Bruno thought. He hated
her. Guy would be happy without an animal

245
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:52,610
like that in his life. Everything was so good.
'I have a friend, and my life has a real purpose,'

246
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,840
Bruno thought. 'I'd do anything for Guy.'

247
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,530
When the train arrived at Metcalf, station
Bruno looked for Miriam's address in the telephone

248
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:11,460
book. Miriam's family name was Joyce and she
lived with her parents. There were seven people

249
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:19,110
called Joyce in the book, one was a Mrs M.
Joyce. Perhaps that was Miriam's mother, and

250
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,850
she was called Miriam, too?

251
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:32,590
Bruno took a taxi to the address, 1253 Magnolia
Street, and arrived at nine o'clock. It looked

252
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:40,280
poor and ugly, the kind of place where Miriam
would live. Bruno waited by a tree near the

253
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:49,940
house. After a long time two men and a woman
came out. The woman had red hair and a square,

254
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:59,340
big body. One of the men had red hair, too.
Her brother? They got in a car and drove away.

255
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:05,490
Bruno ran fast for a taxi. He never ran and
it made him ill.

256
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:13,110
He found a taxi and got in. 'Go! Go!' he shouted
at the driver. He could see the car in front

257
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,840
of them. 'Right! Turn right now!'

258
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,120
'Where are you going?' the driver asked. 'Perhaps
I know the place.'

259
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,240
'Shut your mouth and drive!' Bruno screamed.

260
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,210
The driver was annoyed and shook his head,
but he followed the car. Eventually the car

261
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:41,470
stopped in front of a big sign with lights.
It said, LAKE METCALF'S LAND OF ENTERTAINMENT.

262
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:49,500
There were music and lights and people laughing
- an amusement park. Bruno smiled; this was

263
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,880
perfect.

264
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,380
He followed the woman and her friends through
the park. Was she really Miriam? She was quite

265
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:07,580
fat, and her hair was red. Bruno noticed that
she wore red socks with red shoes. Ugly! But

266
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,710
this woman wasn't pregnant.

267
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,040
Then one of the men said, 'Miriam, do you
want some ice-cream?'

268
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,220
'Oooh, yes,' she said.

269
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,570
It was her.

270
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:28,790
'You've got ten minutes to live and you're
pushing ice-cream into your mouth,' Bruno

271
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,090
thought. 'PIG!'

272
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:38,490
Miriam and her friends ran off laughing. They
went on lots of different rides, they went

273
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:46,220
round and round, and up and down. Miriam held
her brother's hand, and then the other man's

274
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:56,740
hand. She kissed him. Bruno hated her soft,
fat face, and her stupid laugh. And what was

275
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,150
she kissing these men for?

276
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:06,040
They all took a boat to an island in the middle
of the Lake Metcalf, and Bruno followed in

277
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:13,770
another boat. The island was dark and quiet,
there were a lot of trees. People came here

278
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:19,030
to kiss and make love. Why were the three
of them here?

279
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:26,531
'Let's sit down,' one of the men said. 'I'll
look for a place down here.' The other man

280
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:28,680
went with him.

281
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:37,270
It was dark and Bruno saw Miriam's shadow
alone against the water. Bruno moved quietly,

282
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,429
and he was there next to her.

283
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:46,789
'Hello,' he whispered, 'Isn't your name Miriam?'

284
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:50,669
She turned. 'Yeah. Who're -?'

285
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:57,720
His hands closed round Miriam's throat and
he pressed tighter and tighter. She couldn't

286
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,480
scream. Bruno pushed her backwards and she
fell over his leg to the ground. He pressed

287
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:13,010
his hands into her throat more and more. Her
skin was very hot. Her head turned from side

288
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:24,081
to side, her lips opened and her teeth came
forward. 'Ssssssss,' she said. 'Ssssss.' Her

289
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:33,860
throat was very fat. Bruno pressed her into
the earth. She was very hot. It was like killing

290
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:42,141
a hot little rat. He took his hands from her
throat. Suddenly Miriam coughed, and Bruno

291
00:28:42,141 --> 00:28:51,120
jumped on her again and pressed and pressed
her throat. He wanted her to die!

292
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,510
Miriam was silent and Bruno took his hands
away. He ran down to his boat and went back

293
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,039
over the water to the park.

294
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:09,370
'Help! Help!' Bruno heard the men shouting.
'My God, she's dead. Help!'

295
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:15,049
Bruno walked slowly out of the park. He needed
a drink and went into a place that looked

296
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,830
like a bar.

297
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,300
'Whisky,' he said.

298
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,740
'We don't sell drink here, son,' the man said.

299
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,020
'But I need a drink!' Bruno shouted.

300
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:33,160
'I don't have any whisky,' the man said. 'Coffee?'

301
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:42,690
Bruno left and ran to the station. He suddenly
knew what he really wanted: a woman. He wanted

302
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:51,480
a woman. He was very excited. He asked a taxi-driver
where to go. The man wrote an address on one

303
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:01,200
of his cards. Bruno ran off and the taxi-driver
watched him until he turned a corner.

304
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,190
CHAPTER SIX
Bruno Did It!

305
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:12,890
Guy sat back against his bed in the hotel
and watched Anne turn over his drawings of

306
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,080
their house. He kissed her hair and then her
face.

307
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,000
'I want it to be a big house,' Anne said.

308
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,429
'Yes,' Guy said. He had the job in Florida
again, which would bring him a lot of money,

309
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:34,290
and then there would be more valuable jobs.
He was very happy.

310
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,480
'Are you hungry?' Anne asked. 'Let's order
some food.'

311
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,820
As they ate, the phone rang.

312
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,760
'Guy?' It was his mother.

313
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,530
'Hello, Mama,' he said.

314
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:59,400
'Guy,' she said. 'It's about Miriam. She's
dead, Guy. Murdered, last night...' She started

315
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
to cry.

316
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,370
Guy put the phone down and told Anne about
Miriam. He started to pack his suitcase while

317
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:10,260
Anne ordered his plane ticket.

318
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,659
'Guy? Are you all right?' Anne asked.

319
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:21,990
Guy was staring at his drawings, but there
were no houses on the paper, they were all

320
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:29,039
drawings of Bruno's smiling face with his
red, tired eyes.

321
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,039
***

322
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:37,610
'What if Bruno did it?' Guy thought on the
plane. He tried to remember every word they

323
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:43,030
had said. 'Did I tell him to do it?'

324
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:49,280
At Metcalf the police asked him some questions
and then Guy went home to his mother. He found

325
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:56,140
a letter waiting for him. Inside was a card
from a Metcalf taxi company and on the other

326
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,530
side, some writing: NICE TOWN METCALF.

327
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:08,940
'That doesn't mean anything,' Guy told himself.
'It could be anyone. Lots of people come to

328
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,120
Metcalf'

329
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,919
At the inquest a lawyer asked Guy about Miriam.

330
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:22,230
'You wanted her dead, didn't you?' the lawyer
said. 'You arranged her murder. You thought

331
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:28,780
she wouldn't give you a divorce, and you didn't
want her to go to Florida. Isn't that true?'

332
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:37,710
'Yes, but I didn't want her dead,' Guy said.
He looked at Miriam's boyfriend, Owen Markham.

333
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:43,790
He was a dark, good-looking man who looked
at Guy with large brown eyes.

334
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:50,929
In the end the inquest decided that some unknown
person had murdered Miriam.

335
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:59,440
The next day a telegram from Bruno arrived:
ALL GOOD WISHES FROM THE GOLDEN WEST.

336
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,059
'It's from Anne's parents,' Guy told his mother.
'It's nothing - nothing.'

337
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:12,740
A few days later Guy went to Florida to start
his new job. Every day he worked he felt good,

338
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:19,720
he knew he was doing the right thing. The
sports club would be a perfect building.

339
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,830
One evening in August he got a letter from
Bruno:

340
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:30,370
I phoned your mother for your address, but
she didn't give it to me. Look, Guy, don't

341
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:36,659
worry. I'm going to be very careful. Write
to me soon.

342
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,691
Your friend, Charley Bruno

343
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:51,010
Then Guy knew. Bruno did it, Bruno did it;
he could not stop thinking those words, Bruno

344
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:58,710
did it. His life was different now, his job,
his mother, Anne, everything was different

345
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,240
now.

346
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,790
When Guy spoke to his mother on the phone
he said, 'Uh, do you remember that man who

347
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:14,869
phoned you for my address? It was a friend,
Phil Johnson. He works in Chicago, and he

348
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:22,889
wanted to see me. Isn't that nice? Don't worry
about it.'

349
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,639
CHAPTER SEVEN
No One to Talk to

350
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,119
'Charley, who're all these people?'

351
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,589
Bruno's mother looked at the stories about
Miriam's murder and the photographs of Guy

352
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:40,559
that Bruno had cut out of the newspapers.

353
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:48,139
'I met Guy Haines on a train,' Bruno said.
He liked saying Guy's name, and he wanted

354
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:53,099
to talk about the murder. 'Someone murdered
his wife.'

355
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,450
'Who did it?' she asked.

356
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:04,510
'They don't know. It's a very difficult murder,
a clever one, I think,' Bruno said. 'You know,

357
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,931
Ma, Guy was the nicest man I ever met, but
his wife was a -'

358
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:15,799
'Charley!' his mother said. 'You're in your
grandmother's house and she doesn't like bad

359
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:23,299
language.' She looked at the glass of whisky
in his hand. 'Oh, Charley, you haven't had

360
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:25,079
breakfast yet.'

361
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,180
'Whisky's good for me, Ma.'

362
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:34,640
'Don't drink too much,' she said. 'Come out
later. You're in California and the sun is

363
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,960
out. It's a beautiful day.'

364
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,780
But the whisky wasn't good for him. Every
morning he had a pain in his chest and he

365
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:51,619
couldn't breathe. When his mother left, Bruno
thought about the murder. He felt so powerful

366
00:35:51,619 --> 00:36:00,180
- he took away life, like God! He wanted to
tell everyone about the murder, about his

367
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:10,680
one great act. Most people, ordinary, common
people, never had one great thing in their

368
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,980
lives.

369
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:21,809
'The newspapers,' he thought. 'I could tell
them all about murder. I could teach them!'

370
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:27,299
Bruno really wanted to talk to Guy about the
murder, but he did not dare to phone or write

371
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:35,020
to him yet. But he had to talk to Guy soon,
he wanted his father dead quickly, and he

372
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,359
wanted Guy to do it.

373
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,039
Bruno's grandmother walked into the room.

374
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:49,719
'Have breakfast with me, my dear,' she said.
'Then I want to go out. A film, perhaps, a

375
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,299
good one with a murder in it, or an amusement
park?'

376
00:36:54,299 --> 00:37:04,130
'An amusement park,' Bruno said with a smile.
'I like them.'

377
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:10,400
When they got back to the house in the afternoon
there was a letter for Bruno:

378
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,519
Dear Charles

379
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:19,609
I don't understand your letter. I don't know
you very well so please don't phone or write

380
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:22,560
to me or my mother again.

381
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,249
Guy Haines

382
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:30,969
Bruno felt the terrible pain in his chest
that he got in the mornings, and then he started

383
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:35,119
to cry.

384
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,940
CHAPTER EIGHT
Bruno Is Everywhere!

385
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:47,440
A few months later, in December, Guy sat in
his office in New York. He was not getting

386
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,630
any offers of jobs and he felt that his guilt
about Miriam's murder kept people away from

387
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:03,500
him. A man needed to be pure inside to draw
plans for a good building, and Guy felt dirty.

388
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,589
He was making drawings of the house for him
and Anne to live in after their wedding when

389
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:10,349
the telephone rang.

390
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:14,529
'Hello, Guy, it's Bruno.'

391
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:19,390
Guy said nothing and put the phone down, but
it rang again.

392
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,489
'I want to see you, Guy,' Bruno said.

393
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,989
'No,' Guy said and put the phone down.

394
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:34,319
That night he and Anne came out of his flat
and Bruno was standing there in the dark.

395
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:38,420
Guy held Anne's hand and tried to keep calm.

396
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,730
'Hello, Guy,' Bruno said softly. He looked
at Anne with great interest, as if he was

397
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,510
surprised to see Guy with a woman.

398
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:56,390
'We must go, we must go,' Guy said and walked
away quickly, with Anne's hand still in his.

399
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,220
'Oh Guy, I just want to...' Bruno said.

400
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,930
'Who was that?' Anne asked.

401
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:11,160
'A man I know. He wants a job,' Guy said.
'It's nothing.'

402
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:21,339
'What does Bruno want?' Guy thought. 'What
does he want?' The question did not go away,

403
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:25,690
and Guy could not stop thinking.

404
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,690
***

405
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:31,779
One morning in January Bruno appeared next
to Guy in the street and said, 'Have a drink

406
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,930
with me, Guy.'

407
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:34,930
'No.'

408
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,589
'Yes,' Bruno said. 'What're you frightened
of?'

409
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:47,559
'Nothing,' Guy said. 'Do I seem frightened?'
('Get the police!' Guy thought. 'The police,

410
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,569
now!' But he couldn't.)

411
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:54,040
'Then have a drink with me,' Bruno said.

412
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,789
Guy agreed to go to a bar.

413
00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:03,970
'Why didn't you tell me about Anne?' Bruno
asked. 'That woman I see you with. I know

414
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,430
all about her.'

415
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:13,089
'This is our last meeting,' Guy said. 'I'm
going to tell the police about you.'

416
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:21,999
'Why didn't you do that last year?' Bruno
smiled. 'I'll tell them you paid me to kill

417
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:30,859
Miriam, tell them you went to Mexico so I
could do it alone. They'll believe me, Guy.'

418
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:36,140
Guy knew this was true. He said, 'I have to
go.'

419
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:42,589
'Wait,' Bruno said. 'You're going to kill
my father.'

420
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:51,200
Guy looked into Bruno's eyes. They were the
eyes of a mad child. Guy felt helpless, he

421
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,640
could do nothing.

422
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:02,289
'I'll go to the police if you don't kill him!'
Bruno said, then he left the bar suddenly.

423
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:03,289
***

424
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:09,259
Over the next two weeks, Guy saw Bruno standing
outside his office every evening when he left.

425
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:15,709
Then the first letter came. It was a map of
Bruno's house with a written plan for the

426
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:23,719
murder. Guy threw it away, but the letters
came every two or three days. The twenty-first

427
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:30,799
letter said: 'Do you want me to tell Anne
about your part in Miriam's murder? You must

428
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:38,951
kill my father soon, before the middle of
March.' Then Bruno sent a big gun. Everything

429
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:43,599
seemed like part of a bad play or film.

430
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,180
Guy looked at his own gun. He had bought it
when he was fifteen, because it was small

431
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:57,400
and beautiful and perfect. He held the gun
gently, and he smiled and thought about when

432
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,410
he was a boy.

433
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,759
Guy spent the next day with Anne in the country,
and they went to look at their house.

434
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,769
'It'll be finished by March,' Guy said.

435
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:15,170
'That's good,' Anne said. 'There'll be two
months before we get married to buy things

436
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,499
for it.'

437
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:24,640
'Do you know what...?' Guy began to say, then
he stopped and looked at Anne from the sides

438
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:32,599
of his eyes. He wanted to tell her about Bruno's
letters and the gun, but he couldn't. He didn't

439
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:40,789
want any secrets from Anne, but here was the
biggest secret of all. Suddenly Guy realized

440
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:50,059
that his life was separating into two parts,
a life with Anne - and a life with Bruno.

441
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:55,589
They went back to Anne's house and before
dinner, Guy took a walk in the garden. He

442
00:42:55,589 --> 00:43:03,459
saw the black shape of a man - it was Bruno!
Guy hit him hard and they both fell to the

443
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:10,450
ground, but Bruno was very strong, and his
hands went towards Guy's throat. Guy wanted

444
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:15,940
to kill him. He pushed Bruno into the grass,
fighting hard.

445
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,450
Suddenly Bruno said, 'Guy, you knew it was
me!'

446
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:26,210
'I'll kill you the next time I find you here!'
Guy shouted.

447
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:35,739
'Oh, Guy! Kill me if you want to!' Bruno said
laughing, 'but are you ready to kill my father?'

448
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:39,079
'I'm ready to call the police,' Guy said.

449
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:47,819
'And I'm ready to tell Anne about you and
Miriam, and then to tell the police!' There

450
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:53,630
was a red light in Bruno's eyes; he looked
like a hungry animal. 'I'll write to Anne

451
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:01,559
tonight, Guy, unless you tell me you're going
to murder my father!' He turned and ran away.

452
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,490
Now Guy was frightened. He waited for Bruno's
letter to Anne to arrive. He knew he couldn't

453
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:16,029
stop it. What could he say to her about the
murder? He did want Miriam dead, he didn't

454
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:17,029
stop

455
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:23,269
Bruno killing her. He was guilty, too, and
his guilt was growing stronger.

456
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:32,039
A few days later Anne phoned Guy. Her voice
was shaking and Guy knew what had happened.

457
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:36,180
'I've had a letter, Guy,' she said.

458
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,619
'Oh?' He tried to be calm. 'A letter?'

459
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:49,869
'There's no name on the letter, Guy,' she
said. 'It says you knew about Miriam's murder.'

460
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:56,009
'I don't understand, Anne,' he said. 'I don't
know...'

461
00:44:56,009 --> 00:45:03,170
'Guy, I won't tell anyone,' Anne said. 'But
what's happening?'

462
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,619
'Nothing's happening, Anne,' Guy said, and
thought his voice sounded strange. 'Can I

463
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,769
see you tonight? We'll talk about it.'

464
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:20,549
'No. I can't,' Anne said.

465
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:28,509
Guy felt he was losing her, and that Bruno
was everywhere. Then Guy realized something

466
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:35,180
more: he had started lying to Anne.

467
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:40,969
CHAPTER NINE
Guy Makes a Decision

468
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:47,130
The next day at work Guy had a call from Douglas
Frear of the Shaw Company. He had sent the

469
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:52,430
company some drawings for a building, and
he wanted them to give him a job.

470
00:45:52,430 --> 00:46:01,120
'Mr Haines,' Mr Frear said, 'I've had a letter
- there's no name on it - and it says that

471
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:08,710
you knew about your wife's murder and that
the police want to speak to you.' He waited

472
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:16,259
for Guy to speak. 'Mr Haines, I wanted to
tell you about the letter. Are the police

473
00:46:16,259 --> 00:46:18,769
still asking questions?'

474
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:29,589
'No, Mr Frear, and I don't know who sent the
letter,' Guy said. 'I don't know what it means.'

475
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:36,249
Then he asked, 'Mr Frear, about the job...?'

476
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:43,519
'I'm sorry, Mr Haines, we gave that to another
architect,' Mr Frear said quickly.

477
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:52,700
Guy went out for a drink. He was very worried.
'If I murder Bruno's father,' he thought,

478
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,029
'all of this will stop. No! I mustn't think
that. But what can I do? What's the way out

479
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:07,710
of this?' Guy drank some more and then went
home. He slept heavily.

480
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:14,589
Early in the morning Guy woke up and felt
someone in the room. He saw the orange end

481
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:21,109
of a cigarette burning in the dark. He knew
who it was and what he wanted.

482
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:25,009
'Bruno?' Guy said.

483
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:30,299
'You're ready now, aren't you, Guy?' Bruno
said softly.

484
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:36,390
'Yes,' Guy said, and immediately felt better.

485
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:44,599
'Mother and I are going away tomorrow,' Bruno
said. 'Do it tomorrow night. I broke the back

486
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:52,210
door, so you can get in easily. Here's a key,
too.' Bruno gave Guy some gloves. 'You'll

487
00:47:52,210 --> 00:48:03,039
need these.' His voice shook, 'Oh, Guy, I'll
never see you again.'

488
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,680
CHAPTER TEN
The Second Murder

489
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,920
Guy took the train for Great Neck that night.
He had the gloves and his own small gun in

490
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,999
his pocket. Bruno's gun was too big. It was
raining when Guy got off the train at Great

491
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:25,020
Neck. There was the bus, like Bruno had said
in all his letters. Guy remembered all of

492
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:30,140
it. At Grant Street, he got off the bus and
started to walk. There was the tree and the

493
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,199
street light, and there was the white wall
of Bruno's house. Guy felt like an actor in

494
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,989
a play he'd already done hundreds of times.

495
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:44,349
Guy walked fifteen steps along the white wall,
then he put up his hands and jumped on to

496
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:50,519
the top of the wall. He looked down and saw
the wooden box. There were no lights on in

497
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:56,029
the house. Guy jumped down on to the box,
landed without a sound, and ran across the

498
00:48:56,029 --> 00:49:01,089
grass towards the back door. He went up the
six white steps near the back of the house

499
00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:05,650
and opened the back door - he didn't need
the key.

500
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:11,140
The kitchen was dark. Guy walked across it
and then went towards the back stairs that

501
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:16,670
the servants used. Bruno had told him not
to use the house stairs because they all made

502
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:24,789
a noise. But Guy had to be careful here, too.
He missed step three, step four and step seven

503
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:29,530
on the back stairs because they made a noise.

504
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,719
Outside the door to one of the servants' bedrooms
the floor made a noise, and at the same time

505
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:42,660
Guy heard a clock - it was midnight. He stopped.
The servant was on the other side of the door.

506
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:49,339
The noise of the clock went on and on - could
the servant hear? Now he remembered, Bruno

507
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:57,279
had said, '... between eleven and midnight.'
Was this why?

508
00:49:57,279 --> 00:50:02,589
Guy felt very hot. Slowly, he opened the door
into the part of the house where the family

509
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:03,710
lived.

510
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:10,119
'I've been here before,' Guy thought. 'I've
done all this before. I know everything about

511
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:16,550
this house.' Again he felt like an actor in
a play who did the same thing night after

512
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:20,509
night. None of it was real.

513
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:28,619
Guy closed the stair-door quietly. And there,
just there, very near, was another door - and

514
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:35,380
behind that door was Guy's father. He walked
quietly towards the door, and slowly opened

515
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:40,079
it with his left hand. He held his gun in
his right hand.

516
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:46,979
The bedroom was dark, but some light came
through the window. It was only half open!

517
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:50,260
Bruno said his father always had the window
fully open.

518
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,390
'Because of the rain,' Guy thought. 'But how
will I get out?'

519
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:02,239
Now Guy could see Bruno's father in his bed,
sleeping quietly. There was the round, dark

520
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,200
shape of his head.

521
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,469
'Ha-ha-ha-a!' came through the window.

522
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:12,569
Guy shook with fear. A woman was laughing
somewhere outside.

523
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:19,859
'This man, this man is alive,' Guy thought.
'He could laugh, too, he could... No, don't

524
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:24,329
think. Don't think. Do it now! Do it!'

525
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:32,049
He fired the gun. Nothing happened. It was
all a dream, all a play, nothing was real!

526
00:51:32,049 --> 00:51:40,869
Guy fired again. Nothing... He breathed slowly
and fired again. The room tore with a screaming

527
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:48,269
sound. He fired a fourth time and the screaming
sound came again, as if the world had burst.

528
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:54,010
'Kagh!' said the man in the bed, and his head
moved.

529
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:59,099
Then Guy was running across the grass, but
he didn't remember how he had got there. He

530
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:05,750
ran like a man in a bad dream who runs and
runs but cannot move.

531
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:11,750
'You!' A man's voice shouted behind him. It
was the servant.

532
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,569
Guy stood in the shadow by the white wall.

533
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:20,940
'You!' the servant shouted again. Guy's hand
shot out and hit him on the chin and the man

534
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,650
fell to the ground.

535
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:28,719
Guy jumped over the wall, but it was very
dark and he didn't know where he was. He tried

536
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:35,920
to be calm, then he heard a police car very
near him. The blue light moved over him for

537
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,230
a few seconds.

538
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:45,019
'Where am I?' Guy thought. 'I can't remember...
Where must I go?'

539
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:50,479
The blue light burned his eyes. He turned
and ran away, then some trees caught him.

540
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:55,410
The branches scratched his face and he pushed
them away with his hands, but there were hundreds

541
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:00,979
of them. He couldn't see, he couldn't think.
He felt his own blood warm on his face and

542
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,199
throat.

543
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:07,890
Finally, Guy got out of the trees and saw
a road and the lights of a town. He walked

544
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:14,329
slowly along the road. He still had his gun,
but his gloves were torn to pieces. They were

545
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:20,759
probably in the trees behind him. He was too
tired to go back and look. He wanted to walk

546
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:22,699
and never stop.

547
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,699
***

548
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:28,730
The next day Guy looked at his face in the
mirror. It was covered in scratches, and so

549
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:34,989
were his hands. His body was heavy and tired.
He thought he could never sleep enough in

550
00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:37,029
his life.

551
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:42,670
Guy read the papers. All the stories about
the murder said the murderer was a big, tall

552
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:48,759
man, nothing like himself. But it said the
bullets were very small and Guy knew he had

553
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:54,020
to throw away his gun. While he was reading,
the doorbell rang.

554
00:53:54,020 --> 00:54:03,780
'Hello, Guy. Guy! How did...?' It was Anne.
'Oh, Guy, what happened to your face? Your

555
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,780
hands!'

556
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,390
'A fight. It was nothing,' he said. 'In a
bar, a... Anne?'

557
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:18,970
Anne didn't say anything for a few seconds.
'But Guy, that letter, the fight you had in

558
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:24,650
my garden that night, and now this... What's
happening?'

559
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:30,190
He felt frightened, then he started to cry
and couldn't stop. Anne put her hand on his

560
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,709
shoulder, but she didn't try to hold him.

561
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:42,059
'If I tell her the truth,' Guy thought, 'she'll
never touch me again.'

562
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,779
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Detective Begins Work

563
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:52,140
Bruno sat and looked at Arthur Gerard, his
father's private detective, and thought how

564
00:54:52,140 --> 00:55:01,079
ugly he was. Gerard had a fat pink face and
little eyes, and he wore a dirty suit.

565
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:07,579
'I'll work on this murder for nothing, Charley,'
Gerard said. 'I liked your father. I also

566
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:09,430
think this is all very interesting.'

567
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:14,319
'I don't care what you think,' Bruno said.

568
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,289
'You hated your father, didn't you?' Gerard
asked.

569
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:19,459
'He hated me.'

570
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:23,859
'Tell me about Thursday night again,' Gerard
said.

571
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:31,229
'I left Mother about 2.45 in the morning,
I went to get a hamburger, then I went to

572
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:35,329
a bar, Clarke's,' Bruno said.

573
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:37,849
'Nobody saw you at Clarke's,' Gerard said.

574
00:55:37,849 --> 00:55:42,349
'It was a different bar, then!' Bruno said.

575
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:49,269
'Okay, I want to know who you spoke to,' Gerard
said. 'You see, I think it's strange that

576
00:55:49,269 --> 00:55:55,381
your father died on the night of the day you
left. I think you spoke to someone, and they

577
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:57,380
knew you were going away.'

578
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,900
'I said I don't care what you think,' Bruno
said.

579
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:09,180
Gerard smiled. 'All right Charley. You can
go now,' he said.

580
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:15,289
Bruno left Gerard's office angrily, but then
he thought about Guy. Gerard was too stupid

581
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,160
to find out about him.

582
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:24,039
'Guy and me,' Bruno thought, 'we're like gods.'

583
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:27,450
The next day Gerard came to see Bruno and
his mother.

584
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,890
Bruno was sitting in the garden. 'Anything
new?' he asked Gerard.

585
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:39,640
'We found these,' Gerard said, and showed
Bruno some small pieces of the purple gloves.

586
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:46,009
He looked across the grass. 'The murderer
ran over there,' Gerard said, 'then he got

587
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:51,009
caught in the branches of the trees on the
other side of the wall. These pieces were

588
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:52,019
there.'

589
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:54,680
'Really?' Bruno tried to sound interested.

590
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:01,259
'He knew where to go, too. The whole thing
was planned, the box next to the wall, the

591
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:08,490
broken back door...' Gerard didn't finish.
'I'll see your mother now.'

592
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:14,339
Bruno watched Gerard's fat body walk slowly
across the grass. He tried not to think about

593
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:19,829
Gerard, but the man seemed to be everywhere,
and a few minutes later he followed Gerard

594
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:21,180
into the house.

595
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:26,970
'Do you think Charley knew about the murder?'
Bruno heard his mother ask.

596
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:32,160
'Yes, I think so, Elsie,' Gerard said. 'Don't
you?'

597
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,999
'I'll certainly tell you everything he tells
me, Arthur,' she said.

598
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:43,499
His own mother! What if she remembered all
the stories about Guy from the paper? Suddenly

599
00:57:43,499 --> 00:57:49,920
Bruno felt alone. He wanted to sleep more
than anything, but he needed more and more

600
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,059
whisky for that, and he woke up earlier and
earlier in the morning.

601
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:02,339
CHAPTER TWELVE
The Good Man and the Bad Man

602
00:58:02,339 --> 00:58:07,839
Guy had thrown away the big gun, the purple
gloves, all the clothes he wore on that night,

603
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:14,749
and his shoes, but he did not throw away his
own little gun. He cleaned his flat again

604
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:20,891
and again, especially at night because he
only slept for two or three hours now. If

605
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:26,269
he did not clean the flat, he tried to work.
He had a job to plan a hospital, but how could

606
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:32,939
he do that with so much guilt in him, with
so much murder? He was not taking any money

607
00:58:32,939 --> 00:58:35,210
for the job.

608
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:41,709
How could he kiss his mother again? How could
he talk to his friends? There was only Anne

609
00:58:41,709 --> 00:58:47,870
now. He still loved her, but his love for
her made him two different people. The good

610
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:53,999
man who loved Anne and built hospitals, and
the bad man who murdered old men and helped

611
00:58:53,999 --> 00:58:57,069
to murder his wife.

612
00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:02,259
The new house was ready, and one Sunday Guy
and Anne and her parents went to see it.

613
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:09,089
'I hear there are lots of ducks and birds
here. We could eat some,' Anne's father said.

614
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:12,180
'Are you good with a gun, Guy?'

615
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,079
They all looked round the house. It was only
a month until the wedding now.

616
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:23,900
'We'll sit here every night as husband and
wife,' Guy thought. 'How can I do that, when

617
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,430
I know the things I've done?'

618
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,230
'Guy,' Anne said, 'Are you all right?'

619
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:32,489
'Yes,' he said, and laughed too loud.

620
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:37,559
'I think you're working too hard, you know,'
Anne said.

621
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:41,359
Anne and her mother started to make dinner
and her father made some drinks for all of

622
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,359
them.

623
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:50,529
'What am I doing with these people?' Guy thought.
'They are so good, and I'm so bad. I'm not

624
00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:55,999
part of their family, but if I try hard to
live with them, that other man inside me,

625
00:59:55,999 --> 01:00:01,699
the bad one, will go away. He must!'

626
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:08,019
After dinner, Guy and Anne walked together
in the garden. It was almost dark.

627
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:13,519
'I'm going to get a job with a company of
architects in New York, Anne,' Guy said.

628
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:20,099
'But you have the hospital to do, Guy,' she
said. 'That'll take you a year. Is it because

629
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:23,230
you won't take any money for the hospital
job?'

630
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:27,480
'Partly,' Guy said. 'But I just feel like
it.'

631
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,819
'I know what the problem is,' Anne said.

632
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:39,309
'Do you, Anne?' Guy asked. 'Do you?' For a
minute, he wanted her to know everything.

633
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:45,140
'It's Miriam, isn't it?' Anne said. 'You've
changed so much since she died.'

634
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,400
'No, no, I...'

635
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,869
'Do you want us to marry, Guy?' she asked.

636
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:57,880
He couldn't answer her. He almost didn't know
how to speak to her honestly now.

637
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:08,349
Anne took his hand. 'I think,' she said. 'You
need me a lot just now, and I need you a lot.'

638
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:16,689
Guy looked into her eyes and thought, 'If
I can do this, if I can keep this all, the

639
01:01:16,689 --> 01:01:22,279
other man inside me will go away.'

640
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:27,199
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Wedding Day

641
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:32,069
On the day of his wedding, Guy was waiting
in the church with his friend, Bob Treacher,

642
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:34,880
for Anne to arrive.

643
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,239
'Did you bring any whisky, Bob?' Guy asked.
'I need a drink.'

644
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:46,349
'Oh yes,' Bob said. 'I forgot, here you are.'
He gave Guy the bottle with a smile.

645
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:52,119
Guy opened the bottle and put it on a table.
After a few seconds, he picked it up and threw

646
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:57,939
it against the wall. Broken glass and whisky
spread all over the floor. Guy stood with

647
01:01:57,939 --> 01:02:00,539
his back to Bob.

648
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:03,859
'I'm very sorry, Bob,' he said.

649
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:07,140
'It's all right, Guy,' he said. 'You're nervous.'

650
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:14,450
'No, I'm not nervous,' Guy thought. 'When
are they going to stop this wedding? When

651
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:20,999
are they all going to know about me? This
is worse than the murder. I'm lying to Anne,

652
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:24,420
but only she can save me.'

653
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,499
Guy could not stop the wedding. It was like
the murder of Bruno's father. Guy felt he

654
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:36,380
was an actor in a bad play, doing something
he had done thousands of times before. At

655
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:43,789
the party afterwards Guy suddenly saw Bruno's
face smiling madly. Then it disappeared.

656
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:50,969
'Congratulations, Guy!' People were all shouting
at the same time. 'Good luck, Guy and Anne.'

657
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:55,950
The noise got louder and louder. 'Good luck!
Good luck! GUY AND ANNE!'

658
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:03,450
'Good luck, Guy. I really want you and Anne
to be happy, as happy as I am.' And there

659
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:09,160
was that soft voice and that weak face with
the mad red eyes in it and Bruno's hand was

660
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,179
on Guy's shoulder and he was looking at Anne.

661
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:16,089
'Go away,' Guy whispered. 'You mustn't come
here!'

662
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:22,980
'Are you a relation of Teddy Faulkner?' Bruno
asked Anne. He shook her hand.

663
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,819
'He's my cousin,' Anne said.

664
01:03:24,819 --> 01:03:28,469
'We play tennis sometimes,' Bruno said.

665
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:32,599
'Are you a friend of Guy's?' Anne asked.

666
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:39,439
Bruno laughed. 'Friend! I'm only his oldest
friend in the world. We went to school together.'

667
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:43,839
He put his arm round Guy's shoulder. 'Didn't
we, Guy?'

668
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:48,249
'You never told me about that man, Guy,' Anne
said later.

669
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:55,640
'We didn't really go to school together, Anne,'
Guy said quickly. 'I - I met him at the Parker

670
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,239
Institute... it was last December.'

671
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:02,979
'Can't you see?' Guy thought, as he looked
at all the people in the room who were speaking

672
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:09,680
to Bruno. 'Can't you see he's mad?'

673
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,759
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Guy's Secret Brother

674
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:20,259
Guy took a job with the company Horton, Horton
and Keese, Architects. They gave him a big

675
01:04:20,259 --> 01:04:25,239
shop to build. It was easy to do, nothing
special - anyone could do it.

676
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:29,890
He and Anne had their first party at the house
soon after their wedding.

677
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:33,209
'Bruno's coming to the party,' Anne told Guy.

678
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:37,130
'Why?' Guy said. 'He isn't my friend.'

679
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:41,059
Bruno was drunk when he arrived. He looked
at Anne all the time.

680
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:48,890
'I like your dress, Anne,' he said. Bruno
always noticed women's clothes. 'Now, where

681
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:54,289
will you go for your first holiday? Italy?
You know, Anne, Guy and I always talked about

682
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,739
travelling.'

683
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:02,309
Guy took Bruno to the corner of the room.
'Get out now,' he said. 'Or I'll kill you.'

684
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:09,109
'Is that a promise, Guy?' Bruno laughed. 'You
know, Guy, I think Anne is very beautiful.

685
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:10,859
I like it here.'

686
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:15,920
An hour later he fell behind the sofa, completely
drunk, and went to sleep.

687
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,440
'He can stay the night,' Anne said.

688
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:24,059
'Where did you find him, Guy?' a man asked.
'They won't let him into our club anymore.'

689
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:31,269
A few days later Bruno sent flowers to Anne
to say sorry for being so drunk at the party.

690
01:05:31,269 --> 01:05:36,089
'Aren't they nice?' she said to Guy. 'I think
Bruno's interesting.'

691
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:42,049
Horton, Horton, and Keese liked Guy's drawings
for the shop. Guy hated them; this was the

692
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:47,549
kind of ordinary work he didn't want to do.
He wanted to leave the company, although they

693
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:53,310
wanted him to do more work. But there was
something much worse than this. A normal man

694
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:59,729
could build a bad shop or a good hospital,
but Guy wasn't normal. Sometimes he looked

695
01:05:59,729 --> 01:06:07,519
in a mirror and saw the other man who was
inside him, the murderer, his secret brother.

696
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,890
The telephone rang and Guy's secretary picked
it up.

697
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:15,460
'A man wants to speak to you, Mr Haines,'
she said.

698
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:20,559
'Hello, Guy,' Bruno said. 'Come to lunch.'

699
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,789
Guy couldn't argue with Bruno in front of
the secretary and he agreed to meet Bruno

700
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:30,900
at a restaurant ten minutes later. Bruno had
four expensive ties which he showed Guy.

701
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:38,609
'They're for you, Guy,' he said. 'Do you like
them?' He was like a lover. 'Anne spoke to

702
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:43,829
me on the phone this morning,' Bruno said.
'She told me you're both going on a trip.

703
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:49,699
She's a great woman, Guy. You must be very
happy.' For a moment Bruno wanted to hold

704
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:51,710
Guy's hand, like a brother.

705
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:56,130
'Yes, I am,' Guy said. 'Very lucky.'

706
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:02,999
'What does Anne like doing, Guy?' Bruno asked.
'Does she like me?'

707
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:10,710
'You've never loved a woman, have you?' Guy
said. 'You don't know what love is, do you?'

708
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:15,210
Bruno looked at the table. 'No,' he said.

709
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:20,730
'You give me ties,' Guy said, 'but you could
give me to the police in the same way.'

710
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,779
'Oh, Guy!' Bruno started crying.

711
01:07:23,779 --> 01:07:28,529
'I have to go!' Guy said. He jumped up and
ran out of the restaurant.

712
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:37,500
'Why do people do this to me?' Bruno thought.
'Why? Why?'

713
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,500
***

714
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:46,979
'How do you know Guy Haines's wife?' Gerard
asked Bruno. He had all Bruno's bills, and

715
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:50,829
he had seen the one for the flowers Bruno
sent to Anne.

716
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:55,939
'I'm a friend of her husband,' Bruno said.
'Mother and I were thinking of building a

717
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:57,640
house. He's an architect.'

718
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:06,109
'Why did you send Mrs Haines flowers?' Gerard
asked. 'You must know them very well.'

719
01:08:06,109 --> 01:08:10,069
'No. I went to a party there and I had a good
time.'

720
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:15,510
'Let's talk about all these men you know,'
Gerard said. 'Matt Levine, Mark Lev, you saw

721
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:18,080
a lot of them before the murder.'

722
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,790
'Yeah, and Mark killed his own father, too,'
Bruno said.

723
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:28,290
'Ernie Schroeder?' Gerard asked. 'Charley,
please!'

724
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:32,620
Bruno tried to think of something to say.

725
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:37,330
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Proof!

726
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:43,120
Guy went on a sailing holiday with Anne on
her boat, the India. They were away from home

727
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:50,210
for three weeks. Guy was happy and calm. He
looked at the clear sky and the blue sea,

728
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,850
and the sea made him think of the bridge he
wanted to build, a long white bridge like

729
01:08:54,850 --> 01:09:02,770
a pair of wings. He wanted to be a great architect.
Guy saw Anne looking at him with love in her

730
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:07,030
eyes, and he felt all the bad times were gone.

731
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:10,620
A few days later, the phone rang at his home.

732
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:18,230
'Hello, Mr Haines,' a man said, 'this is Arthur
Gerard. I'm a detective. Could I come to talk

733
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:21,870
to you, at your house, please? Now.'

734
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:30,020
Guy had to say yes, and Gerard came over quickly.
'Do you know Charles Bruno, Mr Haines?' he

735
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,020
asked.

736
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,420
'Yes, I know him.'

737
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:37,850
Gerard said, 'His father was murdered in March'

738
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:43,000
'I didn't know that!' Anne said, and looked
at Guy in surprise.

739
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,460
'Neither did I,' Guy said quickly. 'Murdered?'

740
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:52,470
'When and where did you meet Charles Bruno,
Mr Haines?' Gerard asked.

741
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:59,000
'At - at the Parker Institute last December,'
Guy said. He only said it because he had told

742
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,580
Anne that at the wedding when she asked him
about Bruno. Why hadn't he and Bruno planned

743
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,920
a story?

744
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,150
'When did you see Mr Bruno again?' Gerard
asked.

745
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,370
'At my wedding in June,' Guy said.

746
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:20,050
'And he came to a party in July, didn't he,
Mrs Haines?' Gerard asked Anne.

747
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,900
'Yes,' she answered.

748
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,030
'Do you like him?' Gerard asked, smiling.

749
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:34,120
Anne looked at his smile; she didn't like
it. 'Well enough,' she said finally.

750
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,960
Gerard asked them a few more questions and
then he left.

751
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:43,120
'Does Gerard think Bruno murdered his father?'
Anne asked Guy later.

752
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:50,560
'He probably thinks it's one of Bruno's friends,'
Guy said. ('But it was me, Anne, it was me,'

753
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,980
he thought.)

754
01:10:52,980 --> 01:11:01,040
'You never know what people are really doing,
do you?' Anne said, shaking her head in surprise.

755
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,880
Later in the day, Bruno came to the house.

756
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,260
'You're drunk,' Guy said. 'Get out.'

757
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:11,190
'Perhaps we should get a taxi for you,' Anne
said.

758
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:17,250
Bruno fell against Guy. He was saying the
same thing again and again: 'I'll tell her

759
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,390
- I'll tell her - I'll...'

760
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:25,010
'What?' Anne asked Guy. 'What's he saying?'

761
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:28,970
'Nothing,' Guy said. 'I'll put him to bed.'

762
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:34,180
Guy pulled Bruno out of the room and took
him to a bedroom. Bruno slept for several

763
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,930
hours, and when he woke up Guy was with him.

764
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:45,190
'Bruno, listen to me, did you tell Gerard
we met in December? At the Parker Institute?'

765
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:46,580
Guy asked.

766
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:53,690
'Yeah, I said that,' Bruno said. 'Can I have
a drink? Look, Gerard thinks this friend of

767
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:58,870
mine, Matt Levine, murdered my father. He's
already killed two or three men.'

768
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:04,040
'I won't let another man take the blame for
the murder,' Guy said.

769
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:11,360
'He won't get the blame,' Bruno said. 'Gerard
won't find anything about Matt Levine, or

770
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,750
us. There's no proof'

771
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,960
'Will you go now?'

772
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:22,120
'No,' Bruno said quietly. 'I want to be with
you and Anne.'

773
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,200
And Guy knew that he hated Bruno, but liked
him at the same time.

774
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:35,161
'You know, Guy, I like you, but you're in
more trouble than me,' Bruno said. 'Our servant

775
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:43,120
saw you that night, Anne saw those scratches
on your face, and there's the gun, the gloves...

776
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,020
the police could ask you some very difficult
questions. But what have they got about me

777
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:56,840
and Miriam, Guy? Tell me, Guy, what have they
got?'

778
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
***

779
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:04,310
Guy and Anne were on the India. The sky was
grey and the air was hot. Guy held his little

780
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:05,960
gun in his pocket.

781
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:12,170
'Why is Bruno so interested in you?' Anne
asked Guy.

782
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:17,370
'He's got nothing to do,' Guy said. His hand
tightened round the gun.

783
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:21,010
'And you met him at the Institute?' she asked.

784
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:28,880
'Yes.' Guy looked into the water. 'Why is
she asking all these questions?' he thought.

785
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:36,960
'She knows something is wrong. She knows I'm
lying, but she doesn't know about what.'

786
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,810
Guy heard Anne walk away. He quickly took
his gun out of his pocket and dropped it into

787
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:43,990
the sea.

788
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:48,610
'What was that?' Anne was standing behind
him.

789
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:53,100
He could think of nothing to say to her.

790
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,330
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Gerald Comes Closer

791
01:13:56,330 --> 01:14:06,600
'Ma, I don't feel good.' Bruno was in his
mother's bedroom. He walked very slowly into

792
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,750
her bathroom and got the bottle of whisky
he had hidden there, but he dropped it on

793
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:16,060
the floor. He couldn't control his hands.

794
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,910
'Charley?' his mother said and looked worried.

795
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:25,660
'I can't breathe, Ma!' He tore his clothes
off 'Oh God!'

796
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,730
'I'll get a doctor,' his mother said.

797
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:37,100
'No! They'll take me away!' He screamed, 'Look
at my hands, Ma!' His middle fingers were

798
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:44,700
bent tightly inside his hand. He couldn't
stop it. He couldn't move them. 'Look, Ma!'

799
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,510
'Charley!' his mother shouted.

800
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:59,490
Bruno fell to the floor. He couldn't speak
normally, 'Dome... Massom tehmeh... Ummm,

801
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:03,340
Massom - Aaaagh!'

802
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,240
Then a doctor came and gave Bruno some medicine
and he went to sleep.

803
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:13,270
'The drink is killing him,' the doctor told
Bruno's mother. 'He must stop.'

804
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:17,990
Bruno woke up later and saw Gerard standing
near the bed.

805
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:24,060
'I'm sorry to wake you,' Gerard said with
his stupid smile, 'but I found something.

806
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:28,660
Remember this?' He threw Guy's book on to
the bed.

807
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,710
'I remember,' Bruno said.

808
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:38,810
'I got this book at the Hotel La Fonda. It's
Haines's book. You met him eighteen months

809
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:43,890
ago on the train to Santa Fe, didn't you?'
Gerard said.

810
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:49,910
'No,' Bruno said. 'I found the book on the
train, that's all. I wanted to send it to

811
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:55,020
Guy but I lost it. I met him in December.'

812
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:02,431
'So you made calls to Metcalf eighteen months
ago and you didn't even know Mr Haines?' Gerard

813
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:05,310
asked. 'I found the phone bills.'

814
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:11,560
'Yeah, I phoned about the book!' Bruno said
angrily.

815
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:18,080
'And you called before the murder, but you
didn't call after,' Gerard said. 'Why not?'

816
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,530
'I don't know!' Bruno shouted. 'I'm tired
of murder!'

817
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:32,120
'Oh, I believe that,' Gerard said. 'I believe
that.'

818
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,570
A few moments later Guy had a phone call from
Bruno in his office.

819
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:42,450
'Gerard knows about the book and the phone
calls I made to Metcalf,' Bruno said very

820
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:48,170
quietly, as if someone was listening. 'But
I told him the calls were about the book and

821
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,090
we met in December. All right?'

822
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:58,810
'All right,' Guy said and put the phone down.
Gerard was coming closer and closer, but he

823
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:04,780
couldn't stop it. He looked at the letter
lying next to the phone. It was from his friend,

824
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,350
Bob Treacher, in Canada:

825
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:13,530
I have an important job in Alberta. I want
you to build a bridge for me as soon as possible.

826
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:15,590
Write now.

827
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:16,590
Bob

828
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,590
***

829
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:22,810
'Nobody knows who murdered Guy Haines's first
wife, Miriam,' Gerard said to Bruno in his

830
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:23,810
office.

831
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,810
'I know,' Bruno said.

832
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:33,630
'Did you talk to Guy about Miriam? You're
interested in murder,' Gerard said.

833
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:37,930
'I didn't talk to him about it,' Bruno said.

834
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:42,130
'Do you think he planned it?' Gerard asked.

835
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:49,420
'No, I don't!' Bruno said angrily. 'You obviously
don't know the type of man Guy Haines is.

836
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:52,170
He's a great architect.'

837
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:58,130
Gerard suddenly called out, 'Come in, please,
Mr Haines.' He saw Bruno jump with surprise

838
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,290
as Guy walked into the room.

839
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:07,700
'Did you and Charles ever talk about your
wife's murder, Mr Haines?' Gerard asked.

840
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,660
'No,' Guy said.

841
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:18,250
'Did he ever tell you he wanted to murder
his father?' Gerard asked. He had that slow,

842
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,670
stupid smile on his face.

843
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,790
'No,' Guy said.

844
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:30,040
Gerard held up Guy's book. 'Charles found
this on the train, but you didn't meet on

845
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,830
the train, did you?'

846
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,850
'No,' Guy said.

847
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:39,120
'The waiter who brought dinner to the two
of you in Charles's room on the train says

848
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:47,730
you did, Mr Haines,' Gerard said, looking
into Guy's eyes all the time.

849
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:51,230
Guy felt hot with shame. He couldn't speak.

850
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:54,800
'So what?' Bruno said angrily.

851
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:03,500
'So why are you both lying?' Gerard asked.
'Your wife was murdered, Mr Haines, a few

852
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:10,541
days after you two met. And your father was
murdered a few months later, Charles. Did

853
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:12,320
you plan something?'

854
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,630
'We planned nothing,' Guy said.

855
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:22,850
'Did Charles tell you he wanted his father
dead, Mr Haines? Perhaps you were frightened

856
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:26,580
to tell me about it?' Gerard asked.

857
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:35,530
'No,' Guy said. He felt himself going deeper
and deeper into his own lies. And when would

858
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:40,590
Gerard find out the truth? Did he know it
already?

859
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,250
Bruno and Guy left the office together.

860
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:49,560
'You know,' Bruno said. 'He's looking for
other people. Gerard doesn't think we did

861
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,560
it. We had no reason to do it, did we?'

862
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,560
***

863
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,840
Gerard went to see Anne at home late one autumn
afternoon.

864
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:05,260
'I think,' he said, 'that Charles Bruno told
your husband about this plan to murder his

865
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:11,110
father, and your husband didn't want to talk
about it. Then, if your husband knew Miriam

866
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:17,380
might die, too, they had a kind of secret,
didn't they?'

867
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,970
'Guy couldn't do a thing like that,' Anne
said.

868
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:27,690
'Do you think they met in March when Charles's
father died, and you don't know about it?'

869
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,100
Gerard asked.

870
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:35,420
'It's possible,' Anne said, but she didn't
know why she said it. 'When was that fight?'

871
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:43,910
she thought. 'February, March? And was it
with Bruno? That was it. Guy tried to stop

872
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:46,140
Bruno killing his father.'

873
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:51,310
'How was your husband in March, Mrs Haines?'
Gerard asked.

874
01:20:51,310 --> 01:21:00,460
'He was nervous,' she said. 'It was a difficult
time. His work...' She stopped speaking.

875
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:06,940
Gerard looked at her, then he smiled and said,
'Call me if you think of anything you know,

876
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:10,380
Mrs Haines,' and left quietly.

877
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:16,650
A few minutes later Anne saw Gerard outside
the house, sitting in his car and writing

878
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,650
notes.

879
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:23,450
'Why did I say that about March? Is he writing
about that?' she thought.

880
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:29,380
'Gerard was here,' Anne said that night as
soon as Guy came home. 'He wanted to know

881
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:35,080
about March, if you knew Bruno had planned
his father's murder for that month.'

882
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:41,250
Guy poured a glass of whisky, then he heard
himself saying, 'Look, Anne, Bruno told me

883
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:46,520
on the train that he wanted his father dead.
I'm not going to say anything because the

884
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,210
police can use that to hang an innocent men.'

885
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:59,840
Anne said gently, 'Yes, what you're doing
is right.' And she smiled. 'It's terrible,

886
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,730
isn't it, murder?'

887
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:09,290
Guy hated his lies. He felt empty inside.
He thought he was worse than Bruno, who was

888
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:17,520
honestly bad. Even if he was never caught,
he couldn't live with Anne like this.

889
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,400
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The Perfect Crime

890
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:28,670
Gerard smiled happily at Chief of Police Phil
Dowland, and said, 'Can't you guess?'

891
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:34,950
'About Samuel Bruno's murder?' Dowland asked.
'You think his son, Charles, did it, don't

892
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:39,380
you?' He didn't like Gerard because he was
a private detective and he didn't work by

893
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:41,420
police rules.

894
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:50,370
'No.' Gerard's smile grew wider. 'But I think
he did another murder. Do you know Guy Haines?'

895
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:54,500
'Yes,' Dowland said. 'His wife was murdered
last June.'

896
01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:02,960
'Guy Haines and Charles Bruno met on a train
to Santa Fe ten days before Miriam Haines

897
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,110
died,' Gerard said.

898
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:10,130
'You think Bruno killed her?' Dowland asked.
'You've got no proof.'

899
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:18,170
'Yes, I have,' Gerard said happily. 'I've
spoken to a friend of Bruno's, Edward Wilson,

900
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:24,060
who saw him going to the railway station in
Santa Fe on the day of Miriam's murder, a

901
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:29,900
taxi-driver in Metcalf who drove Bruno to
the amusement park the very night Miriam Haines

902
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:35,940
died, and a man he tried to buy whisky from,
near the amusement park - and another taxi

903
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:43,280
driver who saw him, too. And I've got bills
of phone calls Bruno made to Metcalf.'

904
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:48,690
'But why did Bruno murder this woman?' Dowland
said, laughing. 'Because he met her husband

905
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,780
on a train?'

906
01:23:50,780 --> 01:24:00,450
'No,' Gerard said. 'You don't see, do you?
It was a plan, Bruno wanted Guy to kill his

907
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,790
father, and he did.

908
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:06,560
'Guy Haines!' Dowland shouted. 'Oh, this is...'

909
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:14,430
'Yes, Guy Haines,' Gerard said. 'He didn't
want to, but he had to after Bruno murdered

910
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:22,030
his wife. Guy was frightened. It was all Bruno's
idea, the perfect crime. There was no reason

911
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:28,270
for Guy and Bruno to murder these two people.
They thought the police could never find them.'

912
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,860
'What happens now?' Dowland asked.

913
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:38,400
'I'm going on holiday,' Gerard said. 'I want
to check some more details about Guy Haines.

914
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,330
I can wait a few weeks.'

915
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:47,950
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
A Terrible Accident

916
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:53,000
Guy was living in Canada and building his
bridge. He came home one weekend and saw a

917
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,130
mess in the house only one person could make.

918
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:59,010
'Bruno was here,' he said.

919
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,020
'Yes,' Anne said.

920
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:08,130
'You know he's mad, don't you?' Guy said.
Anne didn't answer and Guy looked at her carefully.

921
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:13,340
Anne thought, 'I know he's the one who wrote
that letter to me in March, and the one you

922
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:16,900
had a fight with. I know there's something.

923
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:23,580
Then she said, 'Guy, I'm going to have a baby.
Are you pleased?'

924
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:29,889
'A baby!' Guy said, and he laughed with happiness.

925
01:25:29,889 --> 01:25:30,889
***

926
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:34,770
The next day Bob Treacher came from Canada
to stay with Guy and Anne. It was a sunny

927
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:38,830
day, and the police had called to say that
they had no more questions for Guy and Bruno

928
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:45,450
about his father's murder. Anne was pregnant,
he had a good job, he felt his life was changing

929
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,480
and all the bad things were in the past.

930
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:56,400
The phone rang and Anne answered. 'Oh, hello,'
she said. 'Yes, come with us. We'll meet you

931
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:04,500
by the boat.' She said to Guy, 'That was Bruno,
he's coming with us on the India today.'

932
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:12,050
And suddenly Guy felt everything seemed black
again. It always came back.

933
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:16,191
They stopped for a friend of Anne's, Helen
Heyburn, on the way to the boat, and Bruno

934
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:18,710
was waiting for them when they arrived.

935
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:26,130
Bruno was very excited. 'Come on, Guy,' he
shouted. 'This is a great day! We've won!'

936
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:32,700
'Won what?' Anne asked and Guy went cold inside.
He looked at Bruno.

937
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,800
'Have a drink,' said Bruno, offering Anne
his bottle of whisky.

938
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,440
'No, thank you,' she said.

939
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,520
'Come on, everybody!' Bruno shouted. 'Let's
go!'

940
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:50,100
The boat moved quickly over the grey sea,
and the wind was quite strong. Bruno ran about

941
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,140
the boat.

942
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,960
'Sit down,' Bob said.

943
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,910
'Who are you?' Bruno asked drunkenly. 'A friend
of Guy's?'

944
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:01,580
'Yes,' Bob said politely.

945
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:06,980
'I've known Guy all his life!' Bruno shouted.
'Have you?'

946
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:13,220
Guy saw Anne look at him with surprise. Every
time with Bruno something bad happened.

947
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:20,630
'When will he say it?' Guy thought. 'The truth?
He could say anything, do anything. For the

948
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:22,210
rest of my life...'

949
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:27,640
'Come on, let's sing!' Bruno said. 'Guy, sing
with me!'

950
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,810
'Oh, sit down,' Helen said to Bruno.

951
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:35,550
'Yes, sit down,' Guy said. 'And keep quiet!'

952
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:41,880
Bruno started to cry. They didn't want him.
He tried to walk away from all of them, even

953
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:47,690
Guy. Suddenly a large wave came up and hit
the boat hard. The wave covered Bruno and

954
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:51,090
with a scream he fell into the sea.

955
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:58,530
'Bruno!' Guy shouted. He jumped into the sea.
It was very cold and the waves seemed to be

956
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:04,730
as high as mountains. He saw Bruno's head
very far away.

957
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:11,970
'Guy!' Bruno called once - a dying man.

958
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:18,240
Guy swam towards the place where he had seen
Bruno, then he dived down into the cold grey

959
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:25,340
water. The sea turned him round and round
and round. There was nothing, Guy could see

960
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:35,980
nothing. He was the loneliest man in the world.
Where was his friend, his brother?

961
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:40,250
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The End at Last

962
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:46,750
Early one morning Guy got out of bed. He was
very lonely without Bruno. He carried all

963
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:52,200
the guilt inside himself now. He picked up
some pieces of paper and started to write

964
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:58,700
about everything, the train, Miriam, how he
murdered Bruno's father. He left it for Anne

965
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,990
to read.

966
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:10,160
'Anne is good,' Guy thought. 'The rest of
us, Bruno, me, his father, Miriam, Gerard,

967
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:18,780
all of us are bad.' Then he thought of Miriam's
boyfriend, Owen Markham. He had loved Miriam,

968
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:25,590
he was the father of her child. Guy remembered
Owen at the inquest, where he seemed calm

969
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:32,720
and gentle. Suddenly, Guy needed to talk to
Owen. It was important, and after writing

970
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,640
to Anne, it was the next thing he had to do.

971
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,640
***

972
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:42,690
He took a plane for Houston, Texas, where
Owen Markham now lived. Gerard had come back

973
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:48,630
from holiday after Bruno died and Guy thought
Gerard might follow him to Houston. He looked

974
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:54,060
carefully at the other passengers on the plane,
but Gerard was not there.

975
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:59,300
After asking some questions in different places
in Houston, Guy found Owen in a bar.

976
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:07,280
'I need to talk to you,' Guy said. 'I've got
a room at the Rice Hotel. Please.'

977
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:14,270
Owen looked at Guy with his calm brown eyes
for a long time, then he said, 'All right.'

978
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:20,190
In the hotel room, they drank whisky. 'Like
the first time with Bruno,' Guy thought.

979
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:28,820
'I know the man who killed Miriam,' Guy said.
'I didn't stop him. I'm sorry, I know you

980
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:30,400
loved Miriam.'

981
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:38,340
'No, I didn't,' Owen said, and drank some
whisky. He spoke slowly. 'And I didn't want

982
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:43,960
that child. She did that to make me marry
her.'

983
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:49,400
It was all wrong, Owen didn't care. But Guy
had to continue.

984
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:55,730
'You must listen to me,' Guy said. 'You must
understand. This man, Miriam's murderer - his

985
01:30:55,730 --> 01:31:01,820
name was Bruno - he made me do a murder, too.
His father. You see, we met on a train and

986
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:07,110
Bruno said we should do the murders and the
police would never catch us. He hated his

987
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:11,900
father, Owen, it was frightening. I said I
had some problems with Miriam but I wanted

988
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:18,270
to divorce her. I said no to her murder, but
then he killed Miriam, and I only knew after

989
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:25,150
he had done it. You understand, I said no.
But after her murder, Bruno phoned me again

990
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:28,950
and again and wrote letters, telling me to
murder his father. I was frightened he would

991
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,510
tell my girlfriend that I knew about Miriam's
murder. And I was tired of it all, so tired,

992
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:42,940
so I said yes, and I agreed to kill his father.
I only wanted Bruno to go away, that's all.

993
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:50,450
I had to do it. Owen, I'm guilty, too. Do
you hate me?'

994
01:31:50,450 --> 01:32:00,300
'Hate you for what?' Owen asked stupidly.
'I don't know you. Who did you murder?'

995
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:08,380
Guy felt very tired. 'You have to go,' he
said to Owen. 'You don't understand.'

996
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,400
Owen was very drunk and he didn't move.

997
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,750
'I'll call a taxi for you,' Guy said.

998
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:21,860
But where was the phone? Guy looked on the
floor and saw it under the bed. The phone

999
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:28,280
was lying near his chair so that someone could
listen to everything he was saying. He picked

1000
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,470
it up.

1001
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,720
'Hello?' he said.

1002
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:40,260
'Hello, Mr Haines,' Gerard's voice said. 'I
heard what you said to Mr Markham. May I come

1003
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,300
in?'

1004
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:47,810
Guy opened the door and looked at Gerard's
big smile. Guy tried to speak, but he said

1005
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:51,909
something completely different from what he
wanted. He said, 'Take me.'

1006
01:32:51,909 --> 01:32:52,639
- THE END -
