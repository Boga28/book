CHAPTER ONE
Down the Rabbit-hole

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:14,339
Alice and her big sister sat under a tree
one sunny day. Alice's sister had a book,

3
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,970
but Alice had nothing with her. She looked
at her sisters book. There were no pictures

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,450
or conversations in it.

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:32,630
'Why is she reading a book without pictures
or conversations?' she thought. 'I'm bored.

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:42,630
I know! I'll look for some Bowers.' Then she
thought, 'No, it's too hot for that and I

7
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,630
feel sleepy.'

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:52,760
Suddenly, a white rabbit ran past her. It
took a watch from its jacket and looked at

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,490
it. 'Oh! Oh! I'm going to be late!' it said.

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:06,270
'That's strange! A rabbit with a watch!' said
Alice.

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,110
She jumped up and ran after the animal. It
ran down a large rabbit-hole, so Alice went

12
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:22,460
down the hole too. She didn't stop and ask,
'How am I going to get out again?'

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:31,530
Alice fell down and down. But she fell very
slowly and didn't feel afraid. 'What's going

14
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,480
to happen next?' she wondered.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,070
She looked round. There were cupboards in
the walls of the rabbit-hole. Some of the

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:51,070
cupboards were open, and there were books
in them. Sometimes she saw pictures. She looked

17
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,130
down, but she couldn't see any light.

18
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:06,820
Down, down, down. 'When will the hole end?'
she wondered. 'Perhaps I'm going to come out

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:16,240
in Australia! I'll have to ask the name of
the country. 'Please, madam, is this Australia

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:25,180
or New Zealand?' No, I can't do that. They'll
think I'm stupid.'

21
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,980
She thought about her cat, Dinah. 'What's
Dinah doing? Will they remember her milk tonight?

22
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:44,170
Oh, Dinah! Why aren't you here with me? Perhaps
there's a mouse here and you can eat it!'

23
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:55,370
Suddenly, Alice was at the bottom of the hole.
'That didn't hurt,' she said and sat up quickly.

24
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,590
She could see the White Rabbit and she ran
after him again. They were in a different

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,690
rabbit-hole now.

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:12,940
'Oh, my ears and nose!' the White Rabbit cried.
'It's getting very late!'

27
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:21,440
He ran faster and vanished through another
hole. Alice followed him through the hole.

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,379
Now she was in a very long room. She looked
round for the White Rabbit, but she couldn't

29
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,330
see him anywhere.

30
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:49,370
There were four doors in the room, but Alice
couldn't open them. Also, she couldn't see

31
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,459
the hole anywhere. 'How am I going to get
out?' she wondered.

32
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:05,160
Then she saw a little table. It had a very
small key on it.

33
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:17,139
'Perhaps it will open one of the doors,' she
thought. She took the key and tried to open

34
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,699
each door with it. But it was no good. The
key was too small.

35
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,990
'This key has to open something,' she thought.

36
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:34,879
Then she saw a very small door about 40 centimeters
high. The little key opened it. She put her

37
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:41,680
head down and looked through the door into
a beautiful garden. She tried to walk through

38
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,469
it, but she was too big. Sadly, she shut the
door again and put the key back on the table.

39
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:53,509
'Why can't I get smaller?' thought Alice.
'This is a very strange place - so perhaps

40
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,509
I can.'

41
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,610
She looked at the table. There was a little
bottle on it.

42
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,180
'That bottle was not on the table before,'
thought Alice.

43
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:09,430
The bottle had 'DRINK ME' on it in large letters.
Alice looked at it carefully.

44
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,740
'Is it all right to drink?' she wondered.

45
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:21,770
'I'll drink a little,' she thought. She had
some and it was very nice. So she had some

46
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,770
more.

47
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:33,589
'This feels strange,' said Alice. 'I'm getting
smaller and smaller!' After a short time,

48
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:37,379
she was only 25 centimetres high.

49
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:44,050
'Now I can go through that door,' she thought.
She went to the door, but could not open it.

50
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:55,751
The key was on the table. She went back to
the table. But Alice was too short and she

51
00:05:55,751 --> 00:06:01,710
couldn't get the key. She tried to climb the
table legs, but it was too difficult. The

52
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,810
little girl sat down and cried.

53
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,080
'Alice! Alice!' she said after some minutes.
'Don't cry. It isn't going to help you. Stop

54
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
now!'

55
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:21,599
Then she saw a little box under the table.
She opened it. There was a cake inside. On

56
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,999
it, she saw the words, 'EAT ME'.

57
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:35,849
'Yes, I will eat it,' Alice said. 'Perhaps
I'll get bigger and then I can get the key.

58
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:46,379
Or perhaps I'll get smaller. Then I can get
under the door into the garden.'

59
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,800
She ate some cake.

60
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,309
'Will I go up or down?' she wondered. She
felt the top of her head with her hand. But

61
00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:02,460
nothing happened - she stayed the same size.
So she finished the cake.

62
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,939
CHAPTER TWO
Alice's Tears

63
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:13,419
'Oh! What's happening?' cried Alice. 'I'm
getting taller and taller!' She looked down.

64
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:24,630
'Goodbye, feet! Who will put your shoes on
for you now? I can't do it! I'll give you

65
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:31,499
some new shoes for Christmas. I'll have to
send them to you!'

66
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:39,089
In a short time, Alice was more than three
meters high.

67
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:52,029
'I want to go into that garden!' she thought.
She took the little key from the table. Then

68
00:07:52,029 --> 00:08:00,639
she went to the door and opened it. But she
was too big and couldn't go through it.

69
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:10,080
She sat down and began to cry again. Because
she was very big, her tears were very big

70
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
too.

71
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,529
'Alice, stop it this minute! Don't cry!' she
said.

72
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:27,249
But she couldn't stop the big tears and after
a time there was water everywhere.

73
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:37,560
She heard the sound of small feet. She looked
down and there was the White Rabbit again.

74
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,770
He had his best clothes on, and in one hand
he had a white hat.

75
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:53,370
'Oh, the Duchess, the Duchess!' he said. 'She'll
be angry with me because I'm late!'

76
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,940
Alice wanted to ask him for help. 'Please,
Sir-' she said very politely.

77
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:10,050
The White Rabbit jumped. He ran out of the
room and his hat fell from his hands. Alice

78
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,110
took the hat.

79
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:19,870
'Am I different?' she wondered. I was Alice
yesterday, but everything is different today.

80
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:28,150
Perhaps I'm not me now. So who am I? That's
the question.'

81
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:36,260
She began to think about her friends. 'Perhaps
I'm one of them,' she thought. 'I'm not Ada

82
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:44,390
because her hair is different to mine. I don't
want to be my friend Mabel, because she doesn't

83
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:54,860
know very much. I know more than she does.'
Then she thought, 'Do I know more? Let me

84
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,380
see. What's four and four? Eight. Eight and
eight is sixteen. Sixteen and sixteen is...

85
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,140
Oh! I can't remember! And she started to cry
again.

86
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,380
But this time her tears were small tears - she
was small again!

87
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:19,880
'Why?' she wondered. Then she understood.
She had the White Rabbit's hat in her hand.

88
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,050
'I'm smaller because I've got the hat in my
hand!' she thought.

89
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:32,270
She put the hat on. It was the right size
for her head.

90
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:41,060
'Am I smaller than the table now?' she wondered.
She went to the table and stood next to it.

91
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,660
She was smaller than the table. 'I'm getting
smaller all the time!' she cried. 'I'm going

92
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,060
to vanish!' She quickly took the hat off.

93
00:10:50,060 --> 00:11:00,510
'Now I can go into the garden!' thought Alice,
and she started to run to the little door.

94
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:10,710
But before she got there, she fell into some
water. She tried to put her feet on the ground

95
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,470
but she couldn't. She had to swim.

96
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,340
'I'm in the sea!' she thought. But it wasn't
the sea. The water was her tears.

97
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:26,630
Something was in the water - Alice could hear
it. 'Perhaps it's a big fish or sea animal,'

98
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,940
she thought. She looked round. There, very
near her, was a mouse.

99
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,710
'I'll speak to it,' thought Alice. 'Everything
is strange here. Perhaps it can speak and

100
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
understand me.'

101
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:49,770
'Oh Mouse,' she said. 'Do you know the way
out of this room?' The Mouse didn't answer.

102
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:56,670
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English. Perhaps
it's a French mouse,' Alice thought. She remembered

103
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,940
some words from her schoolbook, so she spoke
to the mouse in French.

104
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,730
'Where is my cat?' she asked.

105
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,980
The Mouse moved quickly away from her.

106
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,910
'Oh, I'm sorry,' said Alice. 'I forgot. You're
a mouse, so you don't like cats.'

107
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,160
'Don't like cats!' cried the mouse. 'I'm a
mouse. Of course I don't like cats!'

108
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:28,710
'No,' Alice said. 'No. But I think you will
like Dinah. She is a nice, dear thing. She's

109
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:38,680
very quiet and good. She catches a mouse every
day - Oh! You're angry again! We won't talk

110
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,020
about Dinah any more-'

111
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:48,950
'We!' cried the Mouse. 'I never speak about
cats! Our family hates cats! I don't want

112
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,730
to hear any more about them.'

113
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:57,270
'No, no,' said Alice quickly. 'Perhaps - perhaps
you like dogs? There's a very nice little

114
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,839
dog near our house. It likes playing with
children but it works too. It kills all them

115
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:03,839
- Oh! I'm sorry!'

116
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,610
The Mouse looked angrily at her and swam quickly
away.

117
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,770
'Dear Mouse!' said Alice softly. 'Come back
again and we won't talk about cats or dogs.'

118
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:19,710
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round.
It swam slowly back. 'All right,' it said.

119
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,700
'I'll talk to you, but let's get out of the
water.'

120
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:37,480
They climbed out and Alice looked round. There
were a lot of animals and birds in the water.

121
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,090
When they saw her, they got out of the water
too.

122
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,170
CHAPTER THREE
A Race

123
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:52,040
Alice and the birds and animals felt cold
and wet. The largest bird spoke to Alice.

124
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,850
'Good afternoon,' it said loudly. 'I am the
Dodo.'

125
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:03,770
'What is a Dodo?' thought Alice, but she smiled
politely. 'Hello, Dodo. I'm Alice,' she said.

126
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:12,630
'I have an idea,' said the Dodo.' We all want
to get warm. So let's have a race - a Caucus

127
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,630
race.'

128
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,540
'What is a Caucus race?' Alice asked.

129
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:25,620
'I can tell you,' said the Dodo,' but I won't.
I'll show you! That will be easier.'

130
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:35,200
He put the animals and birds in different
places in the room. In a race, somebody usually

131
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:47,310
says,' One, two, three, go!' But the Dodo
didn't do that. Everybody started to run at

132
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,880
different times and stopped at different times
too. After half an hour, the Dodo cried, 'Everybody

133
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:07,150
stop! All the birds and animals stopped. Then
they all came to the Dodo and stood round

134
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,270
it.' Who was first? Who was first?' they shouted.

135
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:28,290
The Dodo had to think about it. He sat 
for a long time with his finger in his mouth.

136
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,090
Then he said, 'Everybody was first. So everybody
can have a chocolate.'

137
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,660
'But who will give us the chocolates?' the
Mouse asked.

138
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:48,790
'She will,' the Dodo said and looked at Alice.
The birds and animals came and stood round

139
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,790
Alice.

140
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,730
'Chocolates, chocolates!' they cried.

141
00:15:51,730 --> 00:16:03,720
'What am I going to do?' thought Alice. I
haven't got any chocolates.' But then she

142
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,900
saw a box of chocolates near her feet.

143
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:17,510
'Here we are,' she said, and opened the box.
There was one chocolate for each bird and

144
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,510
animal.

145
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,029
'But Alice has to have something, you know,'
said the Mouse.

146
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:30,930
'Of course,' the Dodo answered. He turned
to Alice. 'What can you have?' he asked.

147
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,800
'I can have the box,' said Alice sadly.

148
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:45,750
'Give it to me,' said the Dodo and Alice gave
it to him.

149
00:16:45,750 --> 00:17:02,480
They all stood round Alice again, and the
Dodo gave her the box.

150
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,230
'Please take this beautiful box,' he said.

151
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:18,259
'This is very stupid,' thought Alice and she
wanted to laugh. But she didn't. She took

152
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:23,619
the box and smiled politely.

153
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:34,679
The animals and birds ate their chocolates
noisily. Some of them cried. The big animals

154
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:44,889
and birds wanted more. But the chocolates
were too big for the small birds, and they

155
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:55,679
had to eat them very slowly. When they finished
their chocolates, they sat and looked at Alice.

156
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,019
'Oh, where is Dinah?' said Alice. 'I want
her with me.'

157
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:03,710
'And who is Dinah?' the Dodo asked.

158
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:13,269
Alice loved to talk about her cat. 'Dinah's
our cat. She's very nice. And very clever

159
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:21,971
and fast. She can catch a mouse in the morning
for her breakfast and a little bird in the

160
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,669
evening for her dinner - Oh! I'm sorry!'

161
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,080
It was too late. The birds and animals started
leaving.

162
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:36,529
One old bird said, 'I really have to go home.
It gets so cold at night!'

163
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:45,610
Another bird called to her children, 'Come
away, my dears! It's time for bed!'

164
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:53,279
They all spoke politely to Alice and left
the room.

165
00:18:53,279 --> 00:19:00,080
'Oh, why did I talk about Dinah?' cried Alice.
'Nobody likes Dinah down here, but she's the

166
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,490
best cat in the world. Perhaps I'll never
see her again!'

167
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:15,049
She sat down and started to cry again. After
a time, she heard the sound of small feet

168
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:16,340
and looked up.

169
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,360
'Perhaps it's the Mouse,' she thought.

170
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,660
CHAPTER FOUR
The White Rabbit's House

171
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:30,730
It was not the Mouse. It was the White Rabbit.
He came slowly into the room.

172
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:38,379
'Oh, my ears and nose!' he said quietly. 'The
Duchess! The Duchess! She'll be angry! They'll

173
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:44,240
cut off my head, I know! Oh, where is it?
Where did it fall?'

174
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,749
'He's looking for his hat,' thought Alice.

175
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:52,899
She wanted to help him, but she couldn't see
the hat anywhere. She looked round. Everything

176
00:19:52,899 --> 00:20:01,330
was different now. She wasn't in the long
room anymore, and there was no table or water.

177
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,499
She was outside again, in the country.

178
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:12,270
The White Rabbit saw her. 'What are you doing
out here, Mary Ann?' he asked angrily. 'Run

179
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,429
home this minute and bring me a hat. Quick,
now!'

180
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:25,650
Alice didn't say, 'I'm not Mary Ann.' She
felt too afraid. She ran fast and after a

181
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:33,620
short time, she came to a pretty little house.
Above the door were the words 'W. RABBIT'.

182
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,950
She went in and ran up the stairs.

183
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:45,409
'This is very strange,' she thought. 'I hope
I don't meet Mary Ann. Why am I bringing a

184
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:53,889
rabbit his hat? Perhaps when I get home, I'll
do things for Dinah. Perhaps I'll watch mouse-holes

185
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:54,889
for her!'

186
00:20:54,889 --> 00:21:08,749
She went into a small room. There, on a table,
was a hat and a little bottle. Alice took

187
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:17,789
the hat and looked at the bottle. It didn't
have the words 'DRINK ME' on it, but she drank

188
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:19,009
from it.

189
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:27,519
'I know something interesting will happen,'
she thought. 'When I eat or drink something

190
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:37,249
here, it always does. I hope I get bigger
this time. I don't like being small.'

191
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:45,360
She drank half the bottle. 'Oh, I'm getting
much taller!' she cried. 'Oh!' Her head hit

192
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,869
the top of the house and she put the bottle
down quickly.

193
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,380
'Oh no!' she thought. 'I hope I don't get
taller!'

194
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:04,009
She sat down. But after a very short time
she was too big for the room. She had to put

195
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:09,630
one arm out of the window and one foot in
the fireplace.

196
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:16,669
'I can't do any more,' she thought. 'What
will happen to me?' She waited for some time,

197
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:21,090
but she didn't get bigger. 'Well, that's good,'
she thought. But then she tried to move and

198
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,340
couldn't. She didn't feel well and she was
very unhappy.

199
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:32,559
'I'm never going to get out of here,' she
thought. 'It was much nicer at home. First

200
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:41,779
I get larger, then I get smaller, then larger...
Oh, why did I go down the rabbit-hole? But

201
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:46,850
it is interesting here. Perhaps somebody will
write a book about this place - and about

202
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:57,029
me! Perhaps I will, when I'm bigger.' Then
she remembered. 'But I'm bigger now!'

203
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,570
She heard somebody outside. 'Mary Ann, Mary
Ann! Where are you? Bring me my hat!' The

204
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,410
words came from the garden, outside the window.
It was the White Rabbit.

205
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:12,549
He came inside and ran up the stairs to the
room. He tried to open the door. But he couldn't

206
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:13,769
because Alice's back was next to it.

207
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,399
'I'll climb in through the window,' the Rabbit
said.

208
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:24,519
'Oh no, you won't,' thought Alice. She waited
and listened. One of her arms was outside

209
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:28,559
the window. When she could hear the Rabbit
outside the window, she moved her arm up and

210
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,830
down. There was a little cry.

211
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,619
'Pat, Pat, where are you? Come here!' shouted
the Rabbit.

212
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,899
'Coming, Sir,' somebody - or something - answered.

213
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:40,230
'What's that in the window?' asked the Rabbit.

214
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,299
'It's an arm, Sir,' Pat answered.

215
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:49,460
'Don't be stupid! How can it be an arm? It's
too big!'

216
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,610
'It is very big, but it is an arm, sir.'

217
00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:00,899
'Well, what's it doing up there? Take it away!'
said the Rabbit angrily.

218
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,860
Alice moved her arm again. Now there were
two little cries. Everything was quiet for

219
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:10,749
a short time, then something hard hit her
arm.

220
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,149
'That hurt!' said Alice.

221
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:21,609
Something came through the window and fell
on the floor. Alice looked down. It was a

222
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:22,850
little cake.

223
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:29,090
'A cake? Why did they throw a cake?' she wondered.

224
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:39,080
Then she thought, 'I'll eat it and perhaps
I'll get smaller again. I can't get bigger!'

225
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:49,999
So she ate the cake and two or three minutes
later she was small again. She ran out of

226
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:59,200
the house as quickly as she could.

227
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:08,390
The White Rabbit saw her. He ran after her
but Alice ran too fast for him. After some

228
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:16,899
time, she came to a wood. She was tired because
she was very small now.

229
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:26,640
'I have to get bigger again,' said Alice.
'But how? I have to eat or drink something,

230
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,390
but the question is - what?'

231
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:40,240
That was the question. She looked all round
her, but she couldn't see anything with 'EAT

232
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:52,650
ME' or 'DRINK ME' on it. There were some mushrooms
near her. Some were white and some were brown.

233
00:25:52,650 --> 00:26:02,590
'I eat mushrooms for dinner,' she thought.
'I'll eat some mushrooms and perhaps I'll

234
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,250
get bigger again.'

235
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:14,669
One white mushroom was as big as Alice. She
stood up tall and looked over the top. There,

236
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:19,499
on top of the mushroom, was a large green
caterpillar.

237
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:21,489
CHAPTER FIVE
The Caterpillar

238
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:29,460
The Caterpillar looked at Alice for some time
before it spoke. Then it said slowly, 'Who

239
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
are you?'

240
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:37,119
It was a difficult question. 'I... I don't
really know, Sir,' Alice said. 'I was Alice

241
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:45,519
when I got up this morning. But then I changed
- and then I changed again - and again.'

242
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,230
'What do you mean?' the Caterpillar asked.

243
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,309
'I don't know,' Alice answered. 'You see,
I'm not me now.'

244
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,080
'I don't understand,' said the Caterpillar.

245
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:06,090
'I'll try and tell you,' said Alice. 'You
see, I change all the time. It's very difficult

246
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,350
for me.'

247
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,110
'Why? I can change very easily.'

248
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,480
'Well, perhaps it's not difficult for you,
but it is for me,' said Alice.

249
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:27,320
'For you? Who are you?' said the Caterpillar
and laughed. Alice felt angry. 'It asked me

250
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:42,159
that question before,' she thought. She stood
very tall and said, 'I will tell you, but

251
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,730
first, you tell me. Who are you?'

252
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,239
'Why do I have to tell you?' asked the Caterpillar.

253
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:54,340
This was another difficult question and Alice
could not answer it.

254
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,499
'This caterpillar isn't very friendly,' she
thought. So she walked away.

255
00:27:57,499 --> 00:28:00,580
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called. 'I want
to tell you something important.' Alice turned

256
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,059
and came back again.

257
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,869
'Don't get angry,' said the Caterpillar.

258
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:09,820
'Is that all?' Alice asked. She felt very
angry with the Caterpillar.

259
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,850
'No,' said the Caterpillar.

260
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:18,629
It did not speak for some minutes, then it
said, 'So you're different, are you?'

261
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:25,769
'Yes, I am, Sir,' said Alice. 'I can't remember
things, and my size changes all the time.

262
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,590
Sometimes I get bigger and then I get smaller
again.'

263
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:38,919
'So you can't remember things,' said the Caterpillar.
'Try this. Repeat, "You are old, Father William."'

264
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,200
Alice put her hands behind her back and repeated:

265
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,049
'You are old, Father William,' the young man
said,

266
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:53,249
'And your hair is now very white;

267
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:58,639
So why do you often stand on your head -

268
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:04,029
Do you think at your age it is right?'

269
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,129
'You are old, Father William,' the young man
said,

270
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,129
'You are old and really quite fat;

271
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:19,419
But you jump up and down and turn round and
round,

272
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:22,769
Now what is the answer to that?'

273
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:29,269
'That is not right,' said the Caterpillar.
'I know. Some of the words are different,'

274
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,409
said Alice.

275
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:42,100
'It's wrong from beginning to end,' said the
Caterpillar. It was quiet for a time. Then

276
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:48,350
it asked, 'What size would you like to be?'

277
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,909
'I'd like to be taller,' said Alice. 'Seven
centimetres is too small.'

278
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:59,710
'Seven centimetres is a very good size,' said
the Caterpillar angrily. It stood up very

279
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,710
tall.

280
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:06,990
'It's a good size for you, but not for me,'
said Alice. And she thought, 'Why does it

281
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,080
get angry all the time?'

282
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,820
The Caterpillar was quiet for some minutes.
Then it climbed down the mushroom. 'Eat from

283
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:27,710
my mushroom and you'll get bigger. Eat from
that brown mushroom there and you'll get smaller,'

284
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:35,480
it said. It started to move away a minute
later, it vanished behind a flower and Alice

285
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
never saw it again.

286
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,990
Alice looked at the two mushrooms and thought
for a minute. Then she went to the Caterpillars

287
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:51,710
mushroom and broke off some of it with her
right hand. She went to the brown mushroom

288
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,650
and did the same with her left hand.

289
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:02,760
She ate some of the brown mushroom. Suddenly,
her head hit her foot.

290
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,679
'Oh!' she cried. 'I'm really small!'

291
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:13,039
She quickly ate a little from the white mushroom
in her left hand. She started to get bigger.

292
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:22,629
She ate some more, and got very tall. Then
she ate some from one hand and some from the

293
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:29,479
other. In a short time, she was her right
size again.

294
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:40,230
She felt quite strange. 'What shall I do now?'
she wondered. 'I know! I'll look for that

295
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,570
beautiful garden.'

296
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:49,940
She began to walk through the wood. After
some time, she came to a little house. It

297
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,019
was about one meter high.

298
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:58,409
'I can't go inside, I'm too big,' Alice thought.
'The people in the house will be afraid of

299
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,599
me. I know! I'll eat some of the brown mushroom.'

300
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:10,369
When she was 18 centimetres high, she walked
to the house. She opened the door and went

301
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:11,369
in.

302
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,029
CHAPTER SIX
The Duchess and the Cheshire Cat

303
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:23,700
Inside, a large, ugly woman sat with a baby
in her arms. There was a cook by the fire

304
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:35,230
and there was food on the table. Near the
fire, there was a large cat with a big smile.

305
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:41,860
This smile went from ear to ear on its face.

306
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:49,639
'I think that woman is the Duchess,' thought
Alice. 'Can girls speak to Duchesses?' she

307
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:50,639
wondered.

308
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:58,159
But the Duchess did not say anything to her,
so Alice asked, 'Please, why is your cat smiling?'

309
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,859
'Because it's a Cheshire Cat, that's why,'
said the Duchess.

310
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,799
'So Cheshire Cats can smile. I didn't know
that,' said Alice.

311
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,249
'You don't know much,' said the Duchess.

312
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:10,259
'That's not very polite,' thought Alice.

313
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:16,340
She started to say something. Suddenly, the
cook threw a plate at the Duchess. The Duchess

314
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,090
didn't move. The cook threw more things - plates,
cups, spoons. Some of them hit the Duchess

315
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:27,669
and the baby. The Duchess did nothing, but
the baby started to cry. 'Oh, don't throw

316
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:32,710
things at the baby!' cried Alice. 'You'll
hit its pretty nose!'

317
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:40,352
'You be quiet, it isn't your baby!' the Duchess
shouted. She began to sing to it. These were

318
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,352
the words of the song:

319
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,352
Be angry with your little boy,

320
00:33:42,352 --> 00:33:43,352
And hit him when he cries:

321
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:44,352
He has to know that he's a child,

322
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:45,352
He's really not your size!

323
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:53,159
The cook sang the song too. When they finished,
they sang it again. The Duchess started to

324
00:33:53,159 --> 00:34:02,460
throw the baby up and down. At the end of
the song, she threw the baby to Alice.

325
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,480
'Here, you can have it now,' site said. 'I
have to get ready. I'm going to see the Queen.'

326
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:15,440
The cook threw another plate at the Duchess.
It didn't hit her, but she left the room quickly.

327
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,050
Alice looked at the baby. It was a strange
little thing and not very pretty. She took

328
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:36,429
it outside. 'I'll have to take this child
away from here, or they'll kill it!' she thought.

329
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,950
The baby made a strange little sound and she
looked at it again.

330
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:45,540
'Its nose is changing!' she cried. She looked
at it very carefully. 'Its face is changing,

331
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,030
everything is changing! Oh! It's not a baby
any more, it's a pig!'

332
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,410
It was very strange, but the baby was now
a pig.

333
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,150
'What am I going to do with it?' Alice thought.
The pig made another, louder sound. Alice

334
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,150
put the little animal down and it ran happily
away into the wood.

335
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,150
'It wasn't a pretty baby, but it's quite a
pretty pig,' thought Alice.

336
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,150
She looked round her and jumped. The Cheshire
Cat was up in one of the trees. The Cat smiled

337
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,150
at Alice.

338
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,150
'It looks kind, but perhaps it will get angry.
They all get angry in this place,' thought

339
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,150
Alice. So she spoke to it very politely. 'Cheshire
Cat, dear,' she said.

340
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,150
The Cat's smile got bigger.

341
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,150
'Please, can you help me? I want to go somewhere
new,' said Alice.

342
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,150
'Where do you want to go?' asked the Cat.

343
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,150
'Somewhere different,' Alice said.

344
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,900
'Somewhere different,' repeated the Cat. It
thought for a minute or two. Then it said,

345
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,900
'Walk that way and you'll come to a house.
A man lives there. He makes hats and he's

346
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
very strange. We call him the "Mad Hatter".'

347
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
'But I don't want to meet a strange man,'
said Alice.

348
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,030
The cat didn't answer her. It said, 'Walk
this way and you'll find the March Hare. He's

349
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,030
strange too.'

350
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,030
'But I told you, I don't want to meet strange
animals.'

351
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,030
'Oh, you can't help that,' said the cat. 'We're
all strange here. I'm strange. You're strange.'

352
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,400
'How do you know I'm strange?' asked Alice.

353
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,840
'Of course you are,' the Cat said. 'Everybody's
strange here. I'm very strange. I laugh when

354
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,090
I'm sad, and I cry when I'm happy. That's
strange. Are you going to see the Queen today?

355
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,090
She's quite strange too?'

356
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,090
'I'd like to see the Queen,' Alice said, 'but
I haven't got an invitation?'

357
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,490
'You'll see me in the Queen's garden?' said
the Cheshire Cat, and vanished.

358
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,110
'That's strange, but not very strange,' thought
Alice. She waited for two minutes, and the

359
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,110
Cat came back again.

360
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,110
'What happened to the baby?' it asked.

361
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,481
'It changed into a pig? Alice said.

362
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:32,481
'I knew it!' said the Cat and vanished again.

363
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:39,150
Alice stayed under the tree for a short time.
'Perhaps it will come back again?' she thought.

364
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,150
'But it didn't.'

365
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,930
'I think I'll go and visit the March Hare?'
said Alice. She started to walk to his home.

366
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,900
After some minutes, she heard a sound. She
looked up, and there was the Cheshire Cat

367
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
in a tree - a different tree.

368
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
'Did you say "pig"?' asked the Cat.

369
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,740
'Yes?' Alice answered. Then she said, 'Cheshire
Cat, one minute you vanish and the next minute

370
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
you're there again. I don't like it?'

371
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,010
'I know?' said the cat. And this time it vanished
quite slowly. First its body went, then its

372
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,010
legs. Then all of it vanished, and there was
only its smile.

373
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,010
'There are a lot of cats without a smile,
but a smile without a cat! Now that's very

374
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,010
strange!' Alice said.

375
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,010
Slowly, the Cheshire Cat's smile vanished
too, and Alice began to walk again. She saw

376
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,170
the March Hare's house through the trees.
It was bigger than the Duchess's house.

377
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,180
Alice ate some of the white mushrooms. She
got bigger again. In a short time she was

378
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,730
about 60 centimetres high. She felt afraid,
but walked to the house.

379
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,020
'I hope the March Hare isn't too strange,'
she thought.

380
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Tea Party

381
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
There was a tree in front of the house. Under
the tree was a big table with a lot of chairs

382
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,090
round it. But there were only three at the
table: the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and

383
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,340
a large brown mouse. The Mouse sat between
the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. It was

384
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
asleep, so they talked over its head.

385
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
When they saw Alice, they cried, 'No, no,
you can't sit here! There isn't a place for

386
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
you!'

387
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
'There are a lot of places,' Alice said. She
sat down in a chair at one end of the table.

388
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
'Have some wine,' the Mad Hatter said politely.

389
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
Alice looked round the table but there was
only tea.

390
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,470
'I don't see any wine,' she answered.

391
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,200
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

392
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,380
'Then why did you say, "Have some wine"? It
wasn't very polite of you,' Alice said angrily.

393
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,390
'We didn't invite you to tea, but you came.
That wasn't very polite of you,' said the

394
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,390
March Hare.

395
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,780
'No, it wasn't. Cut your hair!' said the Mad
Hatter.

396
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,470
'Oh, be quiet,' said Alice.

397
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:40,230
The Mad Hatter opened his eyes very wide,
but he said nothing. Then he took out his

398
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,230
watch and looked at it. 'What day is it?'
he asked.

399
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,230
Alice thought for a little. 'Wednesday, I
think,' she said.

400
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,230
'My watch says Monday,' the Mad Hatter said.
'You see, I was right. Butter isn't good for

401
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,230
a watch.' He looked angrily at the March Hare.

402
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,230
'But it was the best butter,' answered the
March Hare.

403
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,230
'Yes, but you put it in with the bread knife.
Perhaps some bread got in.'

404
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,230
The March Hare took the watch from the Mad
Hatter and looked at it sadly. Then he put

405
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,230
it in his tea. He took it out and looked at
it again.' It was the best butter, you know,'

406
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,230
he repeated.

407
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,230
Alice looked at the watch. 'It's a strange
watch!' she said. 'It tells you the day, but

408
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,230
it doesn't tell you the time.'

409
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,230
'So? Does your watch tell you the year?' asked
the Mad Hatter.

410
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,230
'No,' Alice answered, 'but it's the same year
for a very long time.'

411
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,230
'And my watch doesn't tell the time because
it's always tea-time.'

412
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,230
Alice thought about that. 'I don't really
understand you,' she said politely. She looked

413
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,230
round the table. There were a lot of teacups
on the table.

414
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,230
'We move from place to place,' said the Mad
Hatter.

415
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,230
'Don't you wash the cups?' asked Alice.

416
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,230
'No, we don't have time,' said the Mad Hatter.

417
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,230
'Why not?' asked Alice.

418
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,230
'It's a long story,' said the Mad Hatter.
'Time was my friend, you see. But he and I

419
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,230
aren't friends now. So he doesn't do anything
for me. And I don't have time for anything.'

420
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,230
'I see,' said Alice and smiled politely. But
she didn't really understand.

421
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,230
'Oh, look! The Mouse is asleep again,' said
the Mad Hatter. He took his teacup and put

422
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,230
a little hot tea on the Mouse's nose. It woke
up and started to sing.

423
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,230
'Be quiet!' the Mad Hatter said very loudly,
and the Mouse stopped singing.

424
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,230
'Have some more tea,' the March Hare said
to Alice.

425
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,230
'Thank you, but I haven't got any tea. So
how can I have some more?'

426
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
'You can have more,' the Mad Hatter said.
'You can have more than nothing.'

427
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,230
'I don't think-' Alice began.

428
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,230
'Then don't speak,' the Mad Hatter said.

429
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,230
Alice got up angrily and walked away from
the table into the woods.

430
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,230
'Perhaps they'll call me back,' she thought.
'And then they'll be nice to me and give me

431
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,230
some tea and bread-and-butter.'

432
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,230
But they didn't say anything.

433
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,230
When she looked back, the Mouse was asleep
with its head on its plate.

434
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,230
"I'll never go there again,' Alice said. 'That
was a stupid tea party!'

435
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,230
She looked round and saw a door in one of
the trees. 'A door in a tree? That's strange!'

436
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,230
she thought. And she opened the door and went
inside.

437
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,230
'Oh, good!' she cried. She was back in the
long room, near the little table! 'I'm small

438
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,230
now. I can get through the little door into
the garden.'

439
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,230
The key was on the table. She took it and
opened the little door. Then she ate some

440
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,230
of the brown mushroom. She started to get
smaller. When she was about 30 centimeters

441
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,230
high, she walked through the door into the
garden.

442
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,230
CHAPTER EIGHT
Inside the Garden

443
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,230
Near Alice was a small tree with flowers on
it. There were three gardeners by the tree.

444
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,230
'Be careful, Five!' one of them said.

445
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,230
'I'm always careful, Seven,' answered Five.

446
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,230
Alice went to them. 'What are you doing?'
she asked.

447
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,230
'We're making the flowers red,' one of the
gardeners said.

448
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,230
'That's strange!' thought Alice. 'Why?' she
asked.

449
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,230
The three men looked unhappy.

450
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,230
'You tell her, Seven,' Five said.

451
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,230
'No,' said Seven,' You tell her, Two.'

452
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,230
'Well, Miss, the Queen wanted trees with red
flowers on them. But this tree's got white

453
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,230
flowers! We don't want the Queen to see it.
She'll be very angry and cut off our heads.

454
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,230
So we're making the flowers red before she
sees them.'

455
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,230
'Oh no!' Five shouted suddenly.' The Queen!
The Queen!'

456
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,230
The three gardeners fell to the ground, with
their faces down. Alice heard the sound of

457
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,230
many feet and turned round.

458
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,230
'Oh good!' she thought. 'Now I'll see the
Queen.'

459
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,230
First, ten men with clubs in their hands came
into the garden. Next came the King's men.

460
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,230
There were ten of them, and they had red diamonds
on their clothes. The children of the King

461
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,230
and Queen came next, all with red hearts.
After them there were a lot more people. Most

462
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,230
of them were Kings and Queens. The White Rabbit
was there, but he didn't see Alice. The Knave

463
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,230
of Hearts came next. Last of all were the
King and Queen of Hearts.

464
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,230
When these people saw Alice, they all stopped.
The Queen said to the Knave of Hearts, 'Who

465
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,230
is this?'

466
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,230
The Knave of Hearts didn't know. So he smiled
and said nothing.

467
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,230
'Stupid man!' shouted the Queen. She turned
to Alice and said, 'What's your name, child?'

468
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,230
'My name is Alice, Madam,' Alice answered.

469
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,230
She didn't feel very afraid of the Queen.
'They're only cards,' she thought.

470
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,230
The Queen looked at the gardeners. They were
on the ground and she couldn't see their faces.

471
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,230
Who are these men?' she asked.

472
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,230
'Don't ask me! I don't know,' answered Alice,
not very politely.

473
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,230
The Queen's face got redder and redder. She
looked at Alice and shouted, 'Cut off her

474
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,230
head! Cut-'

475
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,230
'Oh, be quiet!' said Alice.

476
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,230
The Queen stopped shouting. The King put his
hand on her arm. He said quietly, 'Don't be

477
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,230
angry, my dear. She's only a child.'

478
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,230
The Queen turned away from him angrily. 'Turn
those men over!' she said to the Knave of

479
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,230
Hearts. The Knave did this very carefully,
with one foot.

480
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,230
'Get up!' the Queen shouted.

481
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,230
The three gardeners jumped up. The Queen turned
to the little tree and looked at it carefully.

482
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,230
'What's wrong with these flowers?' she asked
the gardeners.

483
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,230
'Well, you see, M - M - Madam,' said Two.
'They were white, and - and-'

484
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,230
The Queen looked from the flowers to the men.
'I see,' she said. 'Cut off their heads!'

485
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,230
Everybody started walking again. The gardeners
ran to Alice. 'Help us!' they cried. Alice

486
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,230
put them behind some trees.

487
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,230
'Don't be afraid,' she said. 'They're not
going to cut off your heads.'

488
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,230
The Kings men looked for the gardeners but
couldn't find them. 'Are their heads off?'

489
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,230
shouted the Queen.

490
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,230
'Yes, Madam,' shouted the King's men.

491
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,230
'Good!' shouted the Queen.

492
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,230
Everybody started walking again and Alice
walked with them.

493
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,230
'It's a very fine day,' somebody said. Alice
turned round and there was the White Rabbit

494
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,230
next to her.

495
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,230
'Very,' said Alice. 'Where's the Duchess?'

496
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,230
'Quiet!' said the Rabbit and looked all round
him. Then he put his mouth near to Alice's

497
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,230
ear. 'They're going to cut off her head!'
he said.

498
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,230
'Why?' asked Alice.

499
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,230
'Did you say, "Oh no!"?' asked the White Rabbit.

500
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,230
'No, I didn't. I said, "Why?"'

501
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,230
'She hit the Queen,' the Rabbit said. Alice
started to laugh.

502
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,230
'Quiet!' said the Rabbit again. 'The Queen
will hear you, she hears everything. You see,

503
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,230
the Duchess came late. When she arrived, the
Queen said-'

504
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,230
Suddenly, the Queen shouted very loudly, 'Cut
off their heads!'

505
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,230
'Who's going to lose their head now?' Alice
wondered. She began to feel afraid. 'The Queen

506
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,230
isn't angry with me now,' she thought. 'But
it will happen. I would like to speak to somebody

507
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,230
about it.'

508
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,230
She looked round. The White Rabbit wasn't
there. She looked up. There was something

509
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,230
above her head.

510
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,230
'What is it?' she wondered. She watched for
a minute or two. It was a smile! 'It's the

511
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,230
Cheshire Cat,' she thought. 'Now I can talk
to somebody.'

512
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,230
'How are you?' the Cheshire Cat asked.

513
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,230
Alice waited. She thought, 'I won't speak
to it before it has its ears - or perhaps

514
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,230
one ear.'

515
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,230
In another minute, she could see its ears
and eyes.

516
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,230
'Do you like the Queen?' the Cat asked.

517
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,230
'I don't,' said Alice. But then she saw the
Queen. She was very near Alice. 'She's wonderful,'

518
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,230
said Alice. The Queen smiled and moved away.
But the King saw the Cat's head and came to

519
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,230
Alice.

520
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,230
'Who are you talking to?' he asked.

521
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,230
'It's a friend - a Cheshire Cat,' answered
Alice.

522
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,230
The King looked carefully at the Cat. 'I don't
like it,' said the King.

523
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,230
'Well, I don't like you,' said the Cat.

524
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
'That's not polite,' said the King and got
behind Alice.

525
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,230
Alice said, 'A cat can look at a King. I read
that in a book, I think.'

526
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,230
'Well, this cat has to go,' said the King.
He called to the Queen, 'My dear, I don't

527
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,230
like this cat.'

528
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,230
The Queen had only one answer to problems.
'Cut off its head!' she shouted loudly. She

529
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,230
didn't look at the Cat. The King smiled happily.

530
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,230
After a short time, there were a lot of people
round the Cat. There was the King and Queen,

531
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,230
and a man with a very long knife in his hand.

532
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,230
'How can I cut off its head?' asked the man
with the knife. 'I can't do it and I'm not

533
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,230
going to.'

534
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,230
'Oh yes you are,' said the King. 'It's got
a head, so you can cut it off.'

535
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,230
'Do something now, or I'll cut off everybody's
head!' said the Queen angrily.

536
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,230
'What do you think?' the King asked Alice.

537
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,230
Alice thought for a minute. Then she said,
'It's the Duchess's Cat. Ask her about it.'

538
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,230
'Bring the Duchess here,' the Queen said.

539
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,230
Then the Cheshire Cat's head started to vanish.
Somebody came back with the Duchess. But now

540
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,230
there was nothing above Alices head - not
an eye or an ear or a smile. The King looked

541
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,230
for the Cat for some time, but he couldn't
find it anywhere.

542
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,230
'Come for a walk, you dear thing,' the Duchess
said to Alice. She put her arm through Alice's

543
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,230
and they walked through the garden.

544
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,230
'She's very friendly to me,' thought Alice.
'Perhaps when the cook isn't there, she's

545
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,230
nice. When I'm a Duchess, I'm going to be
kind to my children.'

546
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,230
'Are you thinking?' asked the Duchess. 'You
have to talk to me, you know.'

547
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,230
'All right,' said Alice. She could hear the
Queen at the other end of the garden. 'Cut

548
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,230
off her head! Cut off his head!' she shouted,
every two or three minutes.

549
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,230
'Will they cut off your head?' Alice asked
the Duchess.

550
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,230
'Oh no, they never cut off anybody's head.
The Queen likes saying it, but she never does

551
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,230
it.'

552
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,230
Alice wanted to ask more questions but they
heard a cry: "The trial is beginning!"

553
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,230
'What trial is it?' Alice asked. The Duchess
didn't answer and started to run. Her arm

554
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,230
was in Alice's, so Alice ran too.

555
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,230
CHAPTER NINE
Who Took the Tarts?

556
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,230
Alice and the Duchess followed everybody into
a house with one very large room. The King

557
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,230
and Queen were there. They sat on big chairs
above all the animals and birds. All the cards

558
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,230
were there too. Near the King was the White
Rabbit. He had a paper in his hand and looked

559
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,230
very important. The Knave of Hearts stood
in front of the King and Queen. He stood between

560
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,230
two men and his head was down. It was his
trial. In the middle of the room was a table

561
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,230
with a large plate of tarts on it.

562
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,230
Alice found a place and sat down. She looked
round.

563
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,230
'I know a lot of the animals and birds here,'
she thought. She looked hungrily at the tarts.

564
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,230
'I hope they finish the trial quickly,' she
thought. 'Then we can eat the tarts.'

565
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,230
Suddenly, the White Rabbit cried, 'Quiet please!'

566
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,230
The King looked round the room. 'Read the
paper!' he said. The White Rabbit stood up

567
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,230
and read from a very long paper:

568
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,230
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,

569
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,230
One lovely sunny day;

570
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,230
The Knave of Hearts, he took those tarts,

571
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,230
He took them all away.

572
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,230
'Cut off his head!' cried the Queen.

573
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,230
'No, no,' said the Rabbit. 'We have to call
people into the room, and ask them questions.'

574
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,230
'All right then. Call the Mad Hatter!' said
the King.

575
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,230
The Mad Hatter came into the room. He had
a teacup in one hand, and some bread-and-butter

576
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,230
in the other hand.

577
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,230
'Why did you call me? I wanted to finish my
tea,' he said.

578
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,230
'When did you begin your tea?' asked the King.

579
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,230
The Mad Hatter thought for a minute. The March
Hare and the Mouse were quite near him and

580
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,230
he looked at them for ideas. Then he said,
'March the fourteenth - I think.'

581
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,230
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.

582
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,230
'Sixteenth,' said the Mouse.

583
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,230
'Write that down,' said the King to the White
Rabbit. Then he said to the Mad Hatter, 'Take

584
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,230
off your hat.'

585
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,230
'It isn't mine,' said the Mad Hatter.

586
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,230
'Oh, so you took it from somebody, you bad
man,' said the King.

587
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,230
'No, no! I sell hats. I'm a Hatter,' answered
the Mad Hatter. He looked very afraid.

588
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,230
'Don't be afraid or I'll cut off your head!'
said the King.

589
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,230
'I'm not a bad man!' the Mad Hatter cried.
'But the March Hare told me-'

590
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,230
'I didn't!' the March Hare said quickly.

591
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,230
'Well, the Mouse said...' The Mad Hatter stopped
and looked at the Mouse. But the Mouse didn't

592
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,230
say anything, because he was asleep.

593
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,230
'After that,' said the Mad Hatter, 'I cut
some more bread-and-butter.'

594
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,230
'But what did the Mouse say?' asked the King.

595
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,230
'I can't remember,' the Mad Hatter said.

596
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,230
'You have to remember,' the King said, 'or
I'll cut off your head.'

597
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,230
'I'm a good man, Sir...' the unhappy Mad Hatter
began. But the King wasn't interested now.

598
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,230
'You can go,' he said to the Mad Hatter.

599
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,230
The Mad Hatter ran out of the room.

600
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,230
'Take his head off outside!' shouted the Queen.
Two men ran after him. But the Mad Hatter

601
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,230
ran very fast and they could not catch him.

602
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,230
Alice did not feel very well. 'What's wrong
with me?' she wondered. And then she understood.

603
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,230
'I'm getting bigger again,' she thought.

604
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,230
She was between the Duchess and the Mouse.
'You're hurting me,' the Duchess said.

605
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,230
'I can't do anything,' said Alice. 'I'm getting
bigger.'

606
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,230
'You can't get bigger here,' said the Mouse.

607
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,230
'Yes, I can,' said Alice. 'You're getting
bigger too.'

608
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,230
'Yes, but not as fast as you,' said the Mouse.
He got up and sat in a different place.

609
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,230
'Call the next person!' said the King.

610
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,230
The next person came in. It was the Duchess's
cook.

611
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,230
The King looked at her. 'What do you know
about these tarts?' he asked. The cook didn't

612
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,230
answer.

613
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,230
'Speak!' said the King.

614
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,230
'No!' said the cook.

615
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,230
'Ask her some questions,' the White Rabbit
said to the King.

616
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,230
'All right, all right,' said the King. 'What
was in those tarts?'

617
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,230
'Fish,' said the cook.

618
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,230
'Don't be stupid,' said the King. 'Call the
next person!'

619
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,230
Alice looked round. 'Who can it be?' she wondered.

620
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,230
The White Rabbit looked at his paper and read
the next name: 'Alice!'

621
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,230
CHAPTER TEN
The End of the Trial

622
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,230
'Here!' cried Alice and stood up quickly.
But she was tall now, and chairs, tables and

623
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,230
people fell here, there and everywhere.

624
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
'Put everything and everybody back!' said
the King loudly. Alice put them all back in

625
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,230
their places. Then the King asked, 'What do
you know about these tarts?'

626
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,230
'Nothing,' answered Alice.

627
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,230
'That's very important,' said the King.

628
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,230
'You mean, unimportant, Sir,' said the White
Rabbit. 'Unimportant - of course,' said the

629
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
King. 'Important - unimportant - important
- unimportant,' he repeated.

630
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,230
He looked at Alice carefully. He took a book
and read from it. 'Alice is more than a kilometer

631
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,230
high. So she has to leave the room!' he said.

632
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,230
'I'm not more than a kilometer high - Alice
began.

633
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,230
'You are,' said the King.

634
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,230
'More than two kilometers high,' said the
Queen.

635
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,230
'Well, I'm not leaving this room,' said Alice.

636
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,230
The King's face went white.

637
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,230
'Cut off her head!' shouted the Queen. Nobody
moved.

638
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,230
'You stupid woman,' said Alice. She was very
large now and she wasn't afraid of anybody.

639
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,230
'Cut off her head!' shouted the Queen.

640
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,230
'Don't be stupid!' Alice said. 'Who's afraid
of you? I'm not. You're only cards!'

641
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,230
The cards - all fifty-two of them - came down
on top of Alice. She felt afraid and angry

642
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,230
and started to fight them. Then she opened
her eyes...

643
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,230
She saw a tree, a big old tree. She was under
it, next to her sister. Her sister's hand

644
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,230
was on her hair.

645
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,230
'Wake up, Alice dear,' her sister said. 'You
slept for a long time!'

646
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,230
'Oh!' said Alice, and then she understood.
She sat up and told her sister about the White

647
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,230
Rabbit and the rabbit-hole. When she finished
her story, her sister laughed.

648
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,230
'Let's go home to tea,' she said. 'It's getting
late.'

649
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,230
'Oh yes! I'd like some tea!' cried Alice.
And she got up and ran home.

650
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,232
- THE END -
