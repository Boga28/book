CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,470
School and Football

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:11,060
I was born an idiot - but I'm cleverer than
people think.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:21,339
I can think things OK, but when I have to
say them or write them down, sometimes they

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:24,019
come out all wrong.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,050
When I was born, my Mom named me Forrest.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,000
My daddy died just after I was born.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,630
He worked on the ships.

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,190
One day a big box of bananas fell down on
my daddy and killed him.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,540
I don't like bananas much.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,110
Only banana cake.

12
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,400
I like that all right.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,370
At first when I was growing up, I played with
everybody.

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,230
But then some boys hit me, and my Mom didn't
want me to play with them again.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,560
I tried to play with girls, but they all ran
away from me.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,090
I went to an ordinary school for a year.

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,390
Then the children started laughing and running
away from me.

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:27,530
But one girl, Jenny Curran, didn't run away,
and sometimes she walked home with me.

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,940
She was nice.

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:38,100
Then they put me into another kind of school,
and there were some strange boys there.

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,979
Some couldn't eat or go to the toilet without
help.

22
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,130
I stayed in that school for five or six years.

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,580
But when I was thirteen, I grew six inches
in six months!

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:01,580
And by the time I was sixteen, I was bigger
and heavier than all the other boys in the

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,580
school.

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,180
One day I was walking home, and a car stopped
next to me.

27
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,320
The driver asked me my name, and I told him.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,730
'What school do you go to?' he asked.

29
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,200
I told him about the idiot school.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,220
'Do you ever play football?' he asked.

31
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,730
'No,' I told him.

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:33,660
'I see other people playing, but I don't play
and they never ask me to play with them.'

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,099
'OK,' the man said.

34
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:43,800
Three days later, the man in the car came
and got me out of school.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,310
Mom was there, and they got all the things
out of my desk and put them in a brown paper

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
bag.

37
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,170
Then they told me to say goodbye to the teacher.

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,990
The man in the car took me and Mom to the
new high school.

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:08,310
There, an old man with grey hair asked me
lots of questions.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,900
But I knew that they really wanted me to play
football.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,320
The man in the car was a football coach called
Fellers.

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,950
Coach Fellers asked me to put on a football
suit, then asked me to undress and dress again,

43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,390
twenty times, until I could do it easily.

44
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:42,390
I began to play football with the high school
team, and Coach Fellers helped me.

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,870
And I went to lessons in the school.

46
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,780
One teacher, Miss Henderson, was really nice.

47
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,659
She taught me to read.

48
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,970
And who do you think I saw in the school cafe?

49
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,920
Jenny Curran!

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:10,180
She was all grown-up now, with pretty black
hair, long legs, and a beautiful face.

51
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,500
I went and sat with her, and she remembered
me!

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,180
But there was a boy in the cafe who started
calling me names, and saying things like,

53
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,340
'How's Stupid?'.

54
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:33,419
Then he threw some milk at me, and I jumped
out of my chair and ran away.

55
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:43,080
A day or two later, after school in the afternoon,
he and his friends came up to me and started

56
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,630
pushing and hitting me.

57
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,720
Then they ran after me across the football
field.

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,060
I ran away fast!

59
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,080
I saw that Coach Fellers was watching me.

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:08,110
He had a strange look on his face, and he
came and told me to put on my football suit.

61
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,110
That afternoon, he gave me the ball to run
with.

62
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,960
The others started running after me, and I
ran as fast as I could.

63
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,200
When they caught me, it needed eight of them
to pull me down!

64
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,530
Coach Fellers was really happy!

65
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,880
He started jumping up and down and laughing.

66
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,130
And after that, everybody liked me.

67
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,889
We had our first game, and I was frightened.

68
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:52,580
But they gave me the ball, and I ran over
the goal line two or three times.

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,479
People were really kind to me after that!

70
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,350
Then something happened which was not so good.

71
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,750
'I want to take Jenny Curran to the cinema,'
I told Mom one day.

72
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,010
So she phoned Jenny's Mom and explained.

73
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:19,550
Next evening, Jenny arrived at our house,
wearing a white dress, and with a pink flower

74
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,610
in her hair.

75
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,540
She was the prettiest thing that I ever saw.

76
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,130
The cinema was not far from our house.

77
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,561
Jenny got the tickets, and we went inside.

78
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:45,270
The film was about a man and a woman, Bonnie
and Clyde, and there was a lot of shooting

79
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,590
and killing.

80
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,230
Well, I laughed a lot.

81
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:59,020
But when I did this, people looked at me,
and Jenny got down lower and lower in her

82
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,620
place.

83
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,370
Once I thought she was on the floor, and I
put my hand on her shoulder to pull her up.

84
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,430
But I pulled her dress, and it came open,
and she screamed.

85
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:21,850
I tried to put my hands in front of her, because
there were people looking at us.

86
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,440
Then two men came and took me to an office.

87
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,890
A few minutes later, four policemen arrived,
and took me to the police station!

88
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,650
Mom came to the police station.

89
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,330
She was crying, and I knew that I was in trouble
again.

90
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,860
And I was in trouble, but I was lucky.

91
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,300
Next day, a letter arrived from a university.

92
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:01,920
It was good news: if I played in their football
team, there was a place for me in school there.

93
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,280
And the police said, 'That's OK with us.

94
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,300
Just get out of town!'

95
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:17,870
So the next morning, Mom put some things into
a suitcase for me, and put me on a bus.

96
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,800
She was crying again.

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,570
But they started the bus, and away I went.

98
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,790
CHAPTER TWO
Life at University

99
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:41,149
When we got to the university, Coach Bryant
came to talk to us.

100
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:49,199
'Last man to get to the practice field will
get a ride there on my shoe!' he shouted at

101
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,199
us.

102
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:54,060
And he meant it when he said that kind of
thing.

103
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,620
We soon learned that.

104
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:05,389
The building that I went to live in was nice
on the outside but not on the inside.

105
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:12,529
Most of the doors and windows were broken,
and the floor was dirty.

106
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,220
I lived in a room with a man called Curtis.

107
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,800
He crashed into the room with a wild look
in his eyes.

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,160
He wasn't very tall, but he was very strong.

109
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,490
'Where are you from?' he asked.

110
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,220
'Mobile,' I told him.

111
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,279
'That's a stupid town!' he said.

112
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:47,129
And that was all of our conversation for several
days.

113
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,179
On the practice field, things didn't start
very well.

114
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:59,720
I got the ball, but I ran the wrong way with
it, and everybody got angry and started shouting

115
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,290
at me.

116
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,500
But Coach Bryant called me across.

117
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,000
'Just get in the line and start catching the
ball,' he told me.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,619
And then I told him something that he didn't
want to hear.

119
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:21,319
'They never taught me to catch a ball at high
school,' I said.

120
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:29,230
'It was difficult enough for me just to remember
where our goal line was.'

121
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't think he was very pleased.

122
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,760
But he started to teach me to catch.

123
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,279
I wanted my Mom, and I wanted to go home.

124
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,790
I didn't like that place.

125
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:50,519
And Curtis was always angry, and I couldn't
understand him.

126
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:57,640
He had a car, and sometimes he gave me a ride
to the practice field.

127
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,459
But one day when he had to change a wheel
on the car, I helped him.

128
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:11,370
'If you're an idiot,' he said, angrily, 'how
do you know how to do that?'

129
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,589
'Maybe I am an idiot,' I said, 'but I'm not
stupid.'

130
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:25,860
Then Curtis ran after me, and called me all
kinds of terrible names.

131
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,120
After that, I moved my bed to another room.

132
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
***

133
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,509
The first football game was on Saturday.

134
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:41,639
I ran well, and we won 35 to 3.

135
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,110
Everybody was pleased with me.

136
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,809
I phoned Mom to tell her.

137
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:50,769
'I heard the game on the radio!'

138
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:51,769
she said.

139
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,139
'I was so happy, I wanted to cry!'

140
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:04,809
That night, everybody went to parties, but
nobody asked me to go.

141
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:11,079
I went back to my room, but I heard music
from somewhere upstairs.

142
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,889
I found a young man who was sitting in his
room playing the harmonica.

143
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,629
His name was Bubba.

144
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,259
He broke his foot in football practice and
couldn't play in the game.

145
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,300
I sat and listened to him.

146
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:37,410
We didn't talk, but after about an hour, I
asked, 'Can I try it?'

147
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,850
and he said 'OK', and gave me the harmonica.

148
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,029
I began to play.

149
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:58,959
After several minutes, Bubba was getting really
excited and saying, 'Good, good, good!'

150
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,100
Then he asked, 'Where did you learn to play
like that?'

151
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,059
'I didn't learn anywhere,' I said.

152
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:14,519
When it got late, he told me to take the harmonica
with me, and I played it for a long time in

153
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,819
my room.

154
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,670
Next day I took it back to Bubba.

155
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,350
'Keep it,' he said.

156
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,959
'I've got another one.'

157
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:34,980
I was really happy, and I went and sat under
a tree and played all day.

158
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,399
It was late afternoon when I began to walk
back to my room.

159
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,160
Suddenly, I heard a voice shout, 'Forrest!'

160
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,800
I turned round - and saw Jenny!

161
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,660
She had a big smile on her face, and she held
my hand.

162
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,939
'I saw you play football yesterday,' she said.

163
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,660
'You were wonderful!'

164
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,309
She wasn't angry about the cinema, and she
asked me to have a drink with her!

165
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:19,769
'I'm taking lessons in music, and I want to
be a singer,' she told me.

166
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:23,600
'I play in a little group.

167
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,680
We're playing at the Students' Centre tomorrow
night.

168
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,560
Why don't you come and listen?'

169
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,449
'OK,' I said.

170
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,379
CHAPTER THREE
The Big Game

171
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:46,639
On Friday night, I went to the Students' Centre.

172
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,620
There were a lot of people there, and Jenny
was wearing a long dress and singing.

173
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:01,910
Three or four other people were in the group
with her, and they made a good sound.

174
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:09,100
Jenny saw me and smiled, and I sat on the
floor and listened.

175
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,649
It was wonderful.

176
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:22,809
They played for about an hour, and I was lying
back with my eyes closed, listening happily.

177
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:24,980
How did it happen?

178
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,839
I'm not sure.

179
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,310
But suddenly I found that I was playing my
harmonica with them!

180
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:40,679
Jenny stopped singing for a second or two,
and the others in the group stopped playing.

181
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:48,499
Then Jenny laughed and began to sing with
my harmonica, and then everybody was saying

182
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:50,399
'Wonderful!'

183
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,810
to me.

184
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,569
Jenny came to see me.

185
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:59,579
'Forrest, where did you learn to play that
thing?'

186
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,470
'I didn't learn anywhere,' I told her.

187
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, after that, Jenny asked me to play with
their group every Friday, and paid me $25

188
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,649
every time!

189
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,649
***

190
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:24,119
The only other important thing that happened
to me at the university was the Big Game at

191
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,350
the Orange Bowl in Miami that year.

192
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,470
It was an important game which Coach Bryant
wanted us to win.

193
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,199
The game started, and the ball came to me.

194
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:46,239
I took it - and ran straight into a group
of big men on the other team!

195
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,970
Crash!

196
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,139
It was like that all afternoon.

197
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,920
When they were winning 28 to 7, Coach Bryant
called me across.

198
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:07,350
'Forrest,' he said, 'all year we have secretly
taught you to catch the ball and run with

199
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,350
it.

200
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,669
Now you're going to run like a wild animal.

201
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:14,669
OK?'

202
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,889
'OK, Coach,' I said.

203
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:20,299
And I did.

204
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:26,360
Everybody was surprised to see that I could
catch the ball.

205
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,270
Suddenly it was 28 to 14!

206
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:39,139
And after I caught it four or five more times,
it was 28 to 21.

207
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:44,080
Then the other team got two men to run after
me.

208
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,230
But that meant Gwinn was free to catch the
ball, and he put us on the 15-yard line.

209
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:59,169
Then Weasel, the kicker, got a field goal,
and it was 28 to 24!

210
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:06,740
But then things began to go wrong again.

211
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:15,850
Weasel made a bad mistake - and then the game
finished, and we were the losers.

212
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,500
Coach Bryant wasn't very happy.

213
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,970
'Well, boys,' he said, 'there's always next
year.'

214
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,549
But not for me.

215
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,659
I soon learned that.

216
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:31,659
***

217
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,860
I couldn't stay at the university.

218
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:42,799
I wasn't clever enough at the lessons, and
there was nothing that anybody could do about

219
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,799
it.

220
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,440
Coach Bryant was very sad.

221
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,429
'I knew this would happen, Forrest,' he said.

222
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,009
'But I said to them.

223
00:18:54,009 --> 00:19:05,880
"Just give me that boy in my team for a year!",
and they did.

224
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,770
And we had a good year - the best year, Forrest!

225
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,770
Good luck, boy!'

226
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:20,690
Bubba helped me to put my things in my suitcase,
then he walked to the bus with me to say goodbye.

227
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,080
We went past the Students' Centre.

228
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,930
But it wasn't Friday night, and Jenny's band
wasn't playing.

229
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,530
I didn't know where she was.

230
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,059
It was late when the bus got to Mobile.

231
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:41,789
Mom knew that I was coming, but she was crying
when I got home.

232
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,809
'What's wrong?'

233
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,000
I asked.

234
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,159
'A letter came,' she cried.

235
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:57,059
'You've got to go in the army!'

236
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,490
CHAPTER FOUR
Vietnam

237
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:13,059
After I left the idiot school, people were
always shouting at me - Coach Fellers, Coach

238
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,340
Bryant, and then the people in the army.

239
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:29,380
But I have to say this: the people in the
army shouted louder and longer than anybody!

240
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,669
Fort Benning was in Georgia.

241
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:41,330
After about a hundred hours on a bus, me and
a lot of other new young soldiers arrived

242
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,330
there.

243
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:49,789
The place where I had to live was just a bit
better than the rooms at the university, but

244
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,110
the food was not.

245
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,770
It was terrible.

246
00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:03,360
Then, and in the months to come, I just had
to do the things that I was told to do.

247
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:11,920
They taught me how to shoot guns, throw hand
grenades, and move along the ground on my

248
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
stomach.

249
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:24,230
One day, the cook was ill, and somebody said,
'Gump, you're going to be the cook today.'

250
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,039
'What am I going to cook?'

251
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,370
I said.

252
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,030
'How do I cook?'

253
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,639
'It's easy,' said one of the men.

254
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:40,799
'Just put everything that you see in the food
cupboard into a big pot and cook it.'

255
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,710
'Maybe it won't taste very good,' I said.

256
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,360
'Nothing does in this place!' he said.

257
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,390
He was right.

258
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:01,590
Well, I got tins of tomatoes, some rice, apples,
potatoes, and everything that I could find.

259
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,269
'What am I going to cook it in?'

260
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,059
I asked one of the men.

261
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,100
There are some pots in the cupboard,' he said.

262
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,230
But the pots were only small.

263
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,370
'You've got to find something,' one of the
other men said.

264
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,659
'What about this?'

265
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:24,659
I asked.

266
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:33,289
There was a big metal thing about six feet
tall and five feet round, sitting in the corner.

267
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,200
'That's the boiler.

268
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,860
You can't cook anything in that.'

269
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,080
'Why not?'

270
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,110
I asked.

271
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,179
'It's hot.

272
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,390
It's got water in it.'

273
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,230
But the men had other things to do.

274
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,210
'Do what you like,' they said.

275
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,850
So I used the boiler.

276
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:03,389
I put everything in it, and after about an
hour you could smell the cooking.

277
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:05,390
It smelled OK.

278
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,830
Then the men came back and everybody was waiting
for their dinner.

279
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,640
'Hurry up with that food, Gump!

280
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,909
We're hungry!'

281
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,000
they shouted.

282
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Suddenly, the boiler began to shake and make
noises - and then it blew up!

283
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,490
It blew the food all over us - me, and all
the men who were sitting at the tables.

284
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,490
'Gump!'

285
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,980
they screamed.

286
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,470
'You're an idiot!'

287
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,089
But I already knew that.

288
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,089
***

289
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:50,230
After a year, we went to Vietnam to fight
in the war.

290
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,879
One evening we went to have a shower.

291
00:23:54,879 --> 00:24:01,749
The 'showers' were just a long hole in the
ground for us to stand in, while somebody

292
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,460
threw water over us.

293
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,879
We were standing in it, when suddenly there
was a strange noise.

294
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:15,510
Then the ground began to blow up all round
us!

295
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:21,750
We threw ourselves on to the floor of the
shower hole, and somebody started screaming.

296
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:31,269
It was some of our men on the far side of
the hole, and there was blood all over them.

297
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:39,419
Then everything went quiet again, and after
a minute or two the rest of us climbed up

298
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,129
out of the hole.

299
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:49,600
The enemy soldiers tried to blow us up for
the next five nights, then it stopped.

300
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,220
But it was time for us to move up north to
help some of our other men in the jungle.

301
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:05,879
We went in helicopters, and there was smoke
coming up out of the jungle when we got there.

302
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:13,020
The enemy started shooting at us before we
got on the ground, and they blew up one of

303
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,549
our helicopters.

304
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,930
It was terrible!

305
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,470
People on fire, and nothing that we could
do.

306
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,679
It was almost night before we found our other
soldiers in the jungle.

307
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,309
And who do you think one of them was?

308
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,919
It was Bubba!

309
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,399
Well, in between the shooting, Bubba told
me about himself.

310
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,990
His foot got too bad to play football, and
he had to leave the university.

311
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:54,400
But his foot wasn't too bad for the army to
get him - and here he was.

312
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,370
'What happened to Jenny Curran?'

313
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,780
I asked.

314
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:10,309
'She left school and went off with a group
of people who were against the war,' he said.

315
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,521
CHAPTER FIVE
Danger in the Jungle

316
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:21,140
There was a little valley between two hills.

317
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,970
We were on one hill and the enemy was on the
other.

318
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:33,410
Then we got orders to move the machine gun
about fifty metres to the left of the big

319
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:40,250
tree that was in the middle of the valley,
and to find a safe place to put it before

320
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,970
the enemy blew us all up.

321
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:49,460
We found a place to put the gun and stayed
there all night.

322
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:55,809
We could hear shooting all round us, but they
didn't hit us.

323
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:03,110
When it was day again, our planes came, and
they blew up the enemy soldiers.

324
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:11,809
Then we watched while our men moved off the
hill and came down into the valley.

325
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,720
Suddenly, somebody started shooting at them!

326
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,179
We couldn't see the enemy soldiers because
the jungle was too thick, but somebody was

327
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,039
shooting at our men.

328
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:33,840
The shooting was in front of us, which meant
that the enemy soldiers were in between us

329
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,690
and our men.

330
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:43,360
And this meant that the enemy was able to
come back and find us, so we had to get out

331
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,920
fast.

332
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:53,570
We began to move back to the hill, but Doyle
suddenly saw more enemy soldiers who were

333
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,950
going towards our men!

334
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:05,389
We waited until they got to the top, then
Bones began shooting with the machine gun.

335
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:09,690
He probably killed ten or fifteen enemy soldiers.

336
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:19,350
Doyle and I and the other two men threw grenades,
but then an enemy soldier shot Bones in the

337
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,350
head.

338
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,990
I pulled the machine gun from his hands, and
shouted to Doyle.

339
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,580
There was no answer.

340
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,440
Two of them were dead, and Doyle was only
just alive.

341
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:43,679
I picked up Doyle and put him across my shoulders,
then I ran towards the hill.

342
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,999
There were bullets flying all round me from
behind - and then I saw more enemy soldiers

343
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,799
in the low grass in front of me!

344
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,403
They were shooting at our men on the hill.

345
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:06,720
I ran fast, shouting and screaming as loudly
as I could.

346
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,210
And suddenly I was in the middle of our soldiers,
and everybody was pleased and hitting me on

347
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,210
the back!

348
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,640
My shouting and screaming frightened the enemy
soldiers away.

349
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,070
They just ran!

350
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,070
***

351
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,130
The weeks went past slowly.

352
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:33,619
I got a letter from my Mom, and I wrote back
to her that everything was OK.

353
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:41,070
I also wrote a letter to Jenny Curran and
asked Mom to ask her parents to send it on

354
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,070
to her.

355
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,789
But I didn't get a reply.

356
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:54,299
Bubba and I decided that we would get a shrimp
boat when we got home again, and catch shrimps,

357
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,409
and make a lot of money.

358
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:00,230
Bubba planned it all.

359
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:06,519
It started to rain one day, and it didn't
stop for two months!

360
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:13,710
But we still had to look for enemy soldiers
- and one day we found them.

361
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:20,919
We were crossing a rice field when suddenly
they started shooting at us.

362
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,070
Somebody shouted, 'Back!'

363
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,619
I picked up my machine gun and ran towards
some trees.

364
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:36,030
I looked round for Bubba, but he wasn't there.

365
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:45,179
Then I heard that he was out in the rice field,
and he was hurt, so I left my gun by the trees

366
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,669
and ran back into the field.

367
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:48,669
'Gump!

368
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,649
You can't go out there!'

369
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,900
somebody shouted.

370
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,260
But I just ran.

371
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,960
Halfway out, I saw another man who was hurt.

372
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:09,280
He was holding a hand up to me - so I picked
him up and ran back to the trees with him.

373
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,730
Then I ran out again and found Bubba.

374
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:21,110
There was blood all over him and he had two
bullets in his stomach.

375
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:30,139
He looked up at me, and said, 'Forrest, why
did this happen?'

376
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,659
What could I say?

377
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:39,480
Then he said, 'Play me a song on the harmonica,
will you?'

378
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,009
There was still a lot of shooting going on,
but I played a song.

379
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:56,460
Then all the colour went out of Bubba's face
and he said something very softly: 'Home.'

380
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,549
And then he died.

381
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:05,580
And that's all I've got to say about that.

382
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
***

383
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,419
The rest of the night was terrible.

384
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,500
The worst night that I've ever known.

385
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:19,360
Nobody could get any help to us, and the enemy
soldiers were so near that we could hear them

386
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,630
talking.

387
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:29,880
Then, when it got light, an American plane
came and used fire-throwers on the enemy - and

388
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,080
almost on us!

389
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,549
Suddenly the trees were on fire, and men were
running out of the jungle with burned skin

390
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,299
and clothes.

391
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:48,989
During all of this, somebody shot me in the
back of the leg, but I can't remember when

392
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:50,110
it happened.

393
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,989
It didn't matter.

394
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:54,909
Nothing mattered.

395
00:32:54,909 --> 00:33:00,990
Bubba was dead, the shrimp business idea was
dead with him.

396
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,950
I just wanted to die, too.

397
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:11,789
Then our helicopters came, and the enemy soldiers
who were left ran away.

398
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:23,630
An hour later, I was out of there and on my
way to the hospital in Danang.

399
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,300
CHAPTER SIX
The White House

400
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,090
I was at the hospital for two months.

401
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:41,190
After the first few weeks my leg was getting
better, and one day I went down into the little

402
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,559
town, to the fish market.

403
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:52,159
I bought some shrimps, and one of the cooks
at the hospital cooked them for me.

404
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,559
Two days later, I went back to the fish market
and talked to a man who was selling shrimps.

405
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,840
'Where do you get them?'

406
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,950
I asked him.

407
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:12,220
He immediately started talking fast in a language
that I couldn't understand, but he took me

408
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,470
somewhere - past all the boats and the beach.

409
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,500
There he took a net and put it in the water.

410
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,750
When he took it out again, it was full of
shrimps!

411
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,379
Every day for the next few weeks, I went with
Mr Chi (that was his name) and watched him

412
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,470
while he worked.

413
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:45,040
He showed me how to catch shrimps with the
net, and it was so easy that an idiot was

414
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,770
able to do it!

415
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,020
Which I did!

416
00:34:50,020 --> 00:35:00,480
Then one day I got back to the hospital and
a Colonel Gooch said, 'Gump, we're going back

417
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,810
to America together!

418
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:09,220
You're going to see the President of the United
States, and he's going to give you a medal

419
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,960
because you were very brave.'

420
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
***

421
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,830
There were about two thousand people waiting
for us at San Francisco airport when we got

422
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,030
off the plane!

423
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,109
What a surprise!

424
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:29,369
A lot of them had beards and long hair.

425
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:36,000
I thought perhaps they were there to welcome
us, but I was wrong.

426
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,920
They were shouting unpleasant things, and
then somebody threw a tomato at Colonel Gooch

427
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,750
and it hit him in the face.

428
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:53,970
He tried to clean it off and not look angry,
but I didn't want to wait for them to start

429
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,840
throwing things at me!

430
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,460
No sir!

431
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,890
I started running.

432
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,510
The people ran after me - all two thousand
of them!

433
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,640
- but they couldn't catch me.

434
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,270
I ran all round the airport, and then I ran
into a toilet and locked the door.

435
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:22,369
I waited in there for almost an hour before
I came out again.

436
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:29,230
I went to look for Colonel Gooch, and I found
him in the middle of a group of policemen.

437
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,750
He was looking very worried until he saw me.

438
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,900
'Come on, Gump!' he said.

439
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,050
'The plane for Washington is waiting for us.'

440
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:49,059
The army sent a car to meet us at Washington
airport, and we drove to a really nice hotel.

441
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:57,349
After we put our suitcases in our rooms, the
Colonel asked me to go out to a bar with him

442
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:59,280
for a drink.

443
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,250
'People are different here,' he told me.

444
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:09,280
'They aren't like the people in California.'

445
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,290
He was wrong.

446
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:18,140
When we got there, he bought me a beer, and
he was telling me about the President and

447
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
my medal when something happened.

448
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:28,120
A pretty girl came up to our table, and the
Colonel thought she was a waitress.

449
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,950
'Get us two more drinks, please,' he said.

450
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:44,260
She looked at him and said, 'I won't get you
anything - not as much as a glass of warm

451
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,410
river-water, you pig!'

452
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:56,140
Then she looked at me and said, 'And how many
babies have you killed today, you big ape?'

453
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:03,590
Well, after that we went back to the hotel.

454
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,590
***

455
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:10,579
Next morning we got up early and went to the
White House, where the President lives.

456
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,579
It's a really pretty house with a big garden.

457
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:22,730
A lot of army people were there, and they
immediately started shaking my hand and telling

458
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,270
me that I was a brave man and that they were
pleased to meet me.

459
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:37,160
The President was a great big old man who
talked like somebody from Texas, and there

460
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,359
were a lot of people standing round him in
the flower garden.

461
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:49,410
Then an army man started to read something,
and everybody listened.

462
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,010
Everybody but me, because I was hungry and
wanted some breakfast.

463
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:02,349
At last the army man finished reading, and
then the President came up and gave me the

464
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:03,349
medal.

465
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:07,690
After that, he began to shake my hand.

466
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:14,930
I was just thinking of getting out of there
and having some breakfast when the President

467
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:21,490
said, 'Boy, is that your stomach making that
noise?'

468
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:35,140
So I said, 'Yes,' and the President said,
'Well, come on, boy, let's go and get something

469
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
to eat!'

470
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,339
And I followed him into the house, and a waiter
got us some breakfast.

471
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:47,510
The President asked me a lot of questions
about Vietnam and the army, but I just said,

472
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:55,819
'Yes, it's OK' or shook my head to say no,
and after several minutes of this we were

473
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:56,900
both silent.

474
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,700
'Do you want to watch TV?'

475
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,290
the President asked suddenly.

476
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:11,619
So me and the President of America watched
TV while I ate my breakfast!

477
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:21,849
Later, when we were back in the garden, the
President said, 'You were hurt, weren't you,

478
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:22,849
boy?

479
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:25,390
Well, look at this...'

480
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:32,780
And he pulled up his shirt and showed me the
place on his stomach where he was hurt once.

481
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,450
'Where were you hurt?' he asked me.

482
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,560
So I pulled down my trousers, turned round
and showed him.

483
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:48,250
Well, lots of newspaper men started taking
photographs before Colonel Gooch could run

484
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,170
across and pull me away!

485
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:59,030
That afternoon, back at the hotel, he came
to my room shouting and throwing newspapers

486
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,030
on to the bed.

487
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:06,740
And there I was, on the front page, with my
trousers down!

488
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,210
'Gump, you idiot!'

489
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,500
shouted Colonel Gooch.

490
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,720
'Yes, sir,' I said.

491
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,950
'That's what I am.

492
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:27,230
But I just try to do the right thing.'

493
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,410
CHAPTER SEVEN
Meeting Jenny Again

494
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:41,210
Soon after that, I heard that I was leaving
the army early, and they gave me some money

495
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,000
for a train ticket to go home.

496
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,040
But all this time, I was thinking about Jenny
Curran.

497
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,119
Just before I left the hospital in Danang,
I had a letter from her.

498
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:05,349
She was now playing in a group called The
Broken Eggs, and they played two nights each

499
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:11,980
week at a place called the Hodaddy Club near
Harvard University.

500
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:19,920
Now that I was free from the army, I just
wanted to go and see her.

501
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,710
So I got a ticket for Boston, instead of Mobile.

502
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:35,020
I tried to walk to the Hodaddy Club from the
train station, but I lost my way, so I took

503
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,020
a taxi.

504
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:45,430
It was in the afternoon, and the man behind
the bar said, Jenny'll be here about nine

505
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,430
o'clock.'

506
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,650
'Can I wait?'

507
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,340
I asked.

508
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,059
'OK,' he said.

509
00:42:53,059 --> 00:43:00,660
So I sat down and waited for five or six hours.

510
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,530
Students began to come in, most of them wearing
dirty jeans.

511
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:11,910
The men had beards, and the women had long,
untidy hair.

512
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:20,069
Later, the group - The Broken Eggs - arrived,
but I didn't see Jenny.

513
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:25,660
Then they began to play - and they were loud.

514
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,950
The music sounded like a plane that was taking
off!

515
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,039
But the students loved it.

516
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,859
And then Jenny came on!

517
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:38,880
She was different.

518
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:48,310
Her hair was all the way down her back, and
she was wearing sun-glasses - at night!

519
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:54,190
She was wearing blue jeans and a shirt with
lots of colours on it.

520
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,809
The group started playing again and Jenny
began to sing.

521
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:08,130
Later, I went outside and walked round for
about half an hour, then went back.

522
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:16,299
There were a lot of people waiting to go in,
so I went round to the back of the place and

523
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:17,599
sat on the ground.

524
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:25,460
I had my harmonica in my pocket, so I took
it out and started to play.

525
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:33,330
I could hear the music that was playing inside
and, after a minute or two, I began playing

526
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,500
with it.

527
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,990
Suddenly, a door behind me opened - and there
was Jenny!

528
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:45,609
'Who is that playing the harmonica?'

529
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:46,609
she said.

530
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:49,359
And then she saw me.

531
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,140
'Forrest Gump!'

532
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:58,759
And she ran out of the door and threw her
arms round me.

533
00:44:58,759 --> 00:44:59,759
***

534
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:02,720
We talked together until it was time for her
to sing again.

535
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,020
'I didn't leave school,' said Jenny.

536
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,730
'They threw me out after they found a boy
in my room one night.

537
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:18,280
I went to California and stayed there for
some time.'

538
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,059
She laughed.

539
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:25,280
'I wore flowers in my hair, and talked about
love.

540
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,720
But the people that I was with were strange.

541
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,490
Then I met a man, and we came to Boston.

542
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,150
But he was dangerous.

543
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:45,760
He was against the war, like me, but he blew
up buildings and things.

544
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,119
I couldn't stay with him.

545
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,600
Next, I met a teacher from Harvard University,
but he was married.

546
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,170
Then I began to sing with The Broken Eggs.'

547
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,170
'Where do you live?'

548
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,070
I asked.

549
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:10,130
'With my boyfriend,' she said.

550
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,079
'He's a student.

551
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,079
You can come back and stay with us tonight.'

552
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:14,079
The boyfriend's name was Rudolph.

553
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,420
He was a little man, and he was sitting on
the floor with his eyes shut when we got to

554
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,869
Jenny's flat.

555
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:27,190
'Rudolph, this is Forrest,' Jenny said.

556
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:35,430
'He's a friend of mine from home, and he's
going to stay with us for a few days.'

557
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:42,030
Rudolph didn't speak or open his eyes, but
he put up his hand and smiled.

558
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:51,710
Next morning, when I got up, Rudolph was still
sitting on the floor with his eyes shut.

559
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:58,710
That afternoon, Jenny took me to meet the
other people in the group, and that night

560
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,730
I began playing my harmonica with them at
the Hodaddy Club.

561
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:09,350
It went well, and I played with them every
night after that.

562
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:16,829
Then one day I came back to the flat and Jenny
was sitting on the floor.

563
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:18,849
'Where's Rudolph?'

564
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,770
I asked.

565
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,559
'Gone,' she said.

566
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,660
'Walked out, like all the others.'

567
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,960
And then she started to cry.

568
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,869
'Don't cry, Jenny,' I said.

569
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:37,049
And I put my arm round her.

570
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,910
Well, it started like that.

571
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:46,460
But the next minute we were kissing and making
love!

572
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:58,039
And when we finished, Jenny said, 'Forrest,
where have you been all this time?'

573
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:03,400
CHAPTER EIGHT
Into Space

574
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,200
Spring and summer went by, and I continued
to play my harmonica with the group.

575
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,230
It was my happiest time of all.

576
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,220
But - you've guessed it - something went wrong.

577
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,960
How did it happen?

578
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,020
I don't know.

579
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:30,890
But one night I was sitting outside the Hodaddy
Club, smoking a cigarette, when a girl smiled

580
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,310
and came up to me.

581
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:38,510
She sat down across my legs and put her arms
round me.

582
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,599
She was laughing and kissing me, and I didn't
know what to do.

583
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:51,470
Suddenly, the door opened behind me, and there
was Jenny.

584
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:58,940
'Forrest, it's time to -' She stopped when
she saw me with the girl.

585
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,660
Then she said, 'Oh, no!

586
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,160
Not you, too!'

587
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,829
I jumped up and pushed the girl away.

588
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:09,829
'Jenny!'

589
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:10,829
I said.

590
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:13,640
'Stay away from me, Forrest!'

591
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
she said.

592
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,400
'You men are all the same!

593
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,840
Just stay away from me!'

594
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,290
She didn't speak to me again that night.

595
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,780
And the next morning she told me to find another
place to live.

596
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:37,380
I went to live with Moses, one of the other
men in the group, and soon after that Jenny

597
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,650
went to Washington to talk and work against
the war.

598
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,730
Moses wrote down the address for me.

599
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,820
So I went back to Washington, too.

600
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,900
There was a lot of trouble there.

601
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:58,240
Police were everywhere, and people were shouting
and throwing things.

602
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,910
And the police were taking some of them away.

603
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:08,000
I went to find Jenny's address, but there
was nobody at home.

604
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,680
I waited outside for most of the day.

605
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:20,140
Then, at about nine o'clock, a car stopped
near the house and some people got out.

606
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,450
And there she was!

607
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:28,289
I started to walk towards her, but she turned
and walked away.

608
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:34,250
The other people - two men and a girl - didn't
know what to say.

609
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,640
'What's wrong with her?'

610
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,569
I asked one of the two men.

611
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,970
'She just got out of prison,' he said.

612
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:49,410
'She was there all night before we could get
her out.'

613
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:56,569
Jenny was in the back of the car now, so I
went over and talked to her through the window.

614
00:50:56,569 --> 00:51:03,789
I told her how I felt - I was sorry about
the girl, and I didn't want to play in the

615
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:06,190
group without her.

616
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:13,740
She listened quietly, then opened the car
door for me to get in, and we sat and talked.

617
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,810
The others were talking about something that
would happen the next day.

618
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:26,220
Some American soldiers planned to take off
their Vietnam medals and throw them away in

619
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,799
front of the crowds of people.

620
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:36,050
Suddenly Jenny said, 'Did you know that Forrest
won a medal?'

621
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:42,500
The others went quiet and looked at me, then
looked at Jenny.

622
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,500
***

623
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,490
Next morning, Jenny came into the living-room.

624
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,910
I was sleeping on the floor of their house.

625
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,230
She woke me up.

626
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,990
'Forrest,' she said.

627
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:58,529
'I want you to do something for me.'

628
00:51:58,529 --> 00:51:59,670
'What?'

629
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,960
I said.

630
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,069
I want you to come with us today, and I want
you to wear your army clothes.'

631
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,299
'Why?'

632
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:10,970
I asked.

633
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,690
'Because you're going to do something to stop
all the killing in Vietnam.'

634
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:22,050
You can guess what I had to do, can't you?

635
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:27,620
I had to throw away my medal with the other
American soldiers.

636
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:33,740
But because my medal was a more famous medal
than theirs, it was more important to Jenny

637
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,080
and her friends.

638
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,609
But it got me into more trouble.

639
00:52:38,609 --> 00:52:45,329
Oh, I threw my medal away, OK - but it hit
somebody really important!

640
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:49,039
One of the President's men!

641
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,420
So they threw me into prison.

642
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,929
Why do things like that always happen to me?

643
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:56,929
***

644
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:05,609
As it happened, I didn't stay in prison long,
because they soon realized that I was an idiot,

645
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,150
and they put me in a special hospital for
idiots.

646
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:17,420
It was the doctors at the hospital who decided
to send me to NASA - that's the space centre

647
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,869
at Houston, in Texas.

648
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:25,039
'You're just the kind of person that they're
looking for!'

649
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,109
the doctors told me.

650
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:30,359
I soon understood why!

651
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:35,579
NASA sent me on a journey into space with
a woman and an ape!

652
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,210
Me, a spaceman!

653
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,900
It was very strange.

654
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,350
All kinds of things went wrong because of
that ape.

655
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:53,339
Instead of coming down in the sea when we
returned, the space ship came down in the

656
00:53:53,339 --> 00:54:00,299
jungle somewhere, and it was four years before
the NASA people found us!

657
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:03,180
But the ape and I were soon good friends.

658
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:12,200
His name was Sue (yes, I know it's a girl's
name, but they sent a male ape up by mistake,

659
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,849
and NASA didn't like to tell the newspapers
that).

660
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:23,450
And it was in the jungle that I met Big Sam
- a man who taught me to play chess.

661
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:31,799
And that was important, as you will see later.

662
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:37,769
CHAPTER NINE
A Real Idiot

663
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:45,589
Of course, the first thing that I wanted to
do when I got back to America was find Jenny.

664
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:49,019
So I phoned Moses in Boston.

665
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:54,760
'The Broken Eggs group has broken up,' he
told me.

666
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,660
'I don't know what happened to Jenny.

667
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:03,190
I heard that she went to Chicago, but that
was five years ago.'

668
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:07,940
'Do you have a telephone number, or anything?'

669
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,010
I asked.

670
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:15,859
'It's an old number,' he said, 'but perhaps
she's still there.'

671
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:20,099
I phoned the number, and she wasn't.

672
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:21,900
'Jenny Curran?'

673
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,500
a man's voice said.

674
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,230
'She went to Indianapolis.

675
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:32,740
Got a job at the Temperer factory.'

676
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,890
So I went to Indianapolis on the bus.

677
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:37,890
***

678
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,309
The Temperer factory was outside the town.

679
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:49,300
I asked about Jenny at the office, and the
woman said, 'Yes, she works in here.

680
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,970
Why don't you wait at the side of the factory?

681
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,569
It's almost lunch-time, and she'll probably
come out.'

682
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:58,750
So I did.

683
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,170
A lot of people came out at lunch-time.

684
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,349
Then Jenny came out.

685
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:11,970
She went and sat under a tree on the grass,
and began eating an apple.

686
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:19,700
I went up behind her and said, 'That looks
like a nice apple.'

687
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,549
She didn't look up.

688
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:26,890
She just said, 'Forrest, it has to be you.'

689
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:33,529
A minute later, I had my arms round her and
we were both crying.

690
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:40,280
People were watching us with strange looks
on their faces, but it didn't matter.

691
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,700
Jenny and me were together again.

692
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:49,210
'I finish work in three hours, Forrest,' Jenny
said.

693
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,830
'Why don't you wait for me in that bar across
the street?

694
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,040
Then I'll take you to my place.'

695
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,380
So I waited in the bar.

696
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,630
And I got into the wrestling business.

697
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,630
How?

698
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,000
I'll tell you.

699
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,920
It started when I arm-wrestled a man in the
bar, and won some money on a bet.

700
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,800
That gave me an idea.

701
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,420
But at first I didn't say anything to Jenny.

702
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,559
She came across to the bar after work, and
we had a drink and talked.

703
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,920
'I saw you on TV when you went up into space,
Forrest,' she said.

704
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:41,559
And I told her all about that, and about Sue,
the ape.

705
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,470
'What happened to him?'

706
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,590
she asked.

707
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,349
'I don't know,' I said.

708
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:50,569
'But he was a good friend.'

709
00:57:50,569 --> 00:58:00,630
Later, we went back to Jenny's flat, and she
said, 'You can stay here.'

710
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:07,690
Next day, when Jenny went to work, I went
back to the bar.

711
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:12,539
Several people wanted to try arm-wrestling
with me again, and I said OK.

712
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:21,660
None of them won because I was too strong,
but plenty of people wanted to try their luck.

713
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:29,039
After about a month, I was winning nearly
two hundred dollars a week, arm-wrestling.

714
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:36,619
Then one day a man called Mike came into the
bar.

715
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:40,390
'You can make a lot more money,' he told me.

716
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,599
'How?'

717
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,599
I asked.

718
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,420
'Wrestling.

719
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,569
Real wrestling,' he said.

720
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,750
'I can teach you.'

721
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:56,289
To make a long story short - he did.

722
00:58:56,289 --> 00:59:02,380
Jenny wasn't happy about the wrestling but
I won a lot of money - sometimes by winning

723
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:08,769
fights, sometimes by losing them because Mike
told me to lose them.

724
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:11,740
Yes, that happens, too.

725
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,080
But then I did something stupid again.

726
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:22,390
I bet on myself winning a fight, after Mike
told me to lose it.

727
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,130
Jenny got really angry.

728
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:28,960
'It isn't honest,' she said.

729
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,269
I didn't listen.

730
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:34,490
I bet all my money on myself to win - and
then I lost the fight.

731
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,490
But there was worse to come.

732
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:45,350
When I got back 
to the flat, Jenny was gone, and there was

733
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,519
a letter waiting for me.

734
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,329
It said:

735
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:51,140
Dear Forrest

736
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,210
You're doing something bad tonight.

737
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:58,609
It isn't honest, and I cannot go on with you
like this.

738
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:05,299
I think about having a house and a family
and things like that now.

739
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:11,109
I watched you grow up big and strong and good.

740
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:18,309
And then, in Boston, I realized that I loved
you, and I was the happiest girl in the world.

741
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:22,789
But then there was that girl outside the Hodaddy
Club.

742
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:30,920
Then you went up into space and I lost you
for four years, and I think you changed.

743
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,619
And I think perhaps I changed, too.

744
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,119
I just want to live in an ordinary way now.

745
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,529
So, I must go and find it.

746
01:00:40,529 --> 01:00:47,440
I am crying while I write this, but please
don't try to find me.

747
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,890
Goodbye, my dear.

748
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,599
love, Jenny

749
01:00:53,599 --> 01:01:03,380
And for the first time ever, I knew that I
was a real idiot.

750
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,960
CHAPTER TEN
Money for Playing Games

751
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:17,130
I decided to go home to Mobile, but the bus
stopped at Nashville on the way and I went

752
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,770
into town for a drink and something to eat.

753
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:29,000
I was going past a hotel when I looked in
the window and saw some people who were playing

754
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
chess.

755
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:38,690
Like I said before, Big Sam taught me how
to play chess when I was in the jungle.

756
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:46,859
Well, I went into the hotel to watch them,
but it was a special chess tournament and

757
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:53,150
it cost five dollars to watch, so I didn't
go into the chess room.

758
01:01:53,150 --> 01:02:01,030
I was just walking out again when I saw a
little old man who was playing chess with

759
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,509
himself at a table near the door.

760
01:02:04,509 --> 01:02:12,400
I had another hour before I had to catch the
bus again, so I went across and watched him.

761
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:20,880
Then I said, 'If you make that move, you'll
lose your queen.'

762
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:29,140
He didn't look up but, after a minute, he
said, 'Perhaps you're right.'

763
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:37,339
It was time for me to get back to the bus
station, but when I started to leave, the

764
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:43,779
old man said, 'Why don't you sit down and
finish this game with me?'

765
01:02:43,779 --> 01:02:46,640
'I can't,' I said.

766
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,010
'I have to catch a bus.'

767
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:55,869
So he waved at me with his hand, and I went
back to the bus station.

768
01:02:55,869 --> 01:03:03,869
But I missed the bus that evening, and there
wasn't another one until the next day.

769
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:11,000
So I walked back to the hotel, and there was
the little old man, still playing against

770
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,770
himself.

771
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:18,519
He looked up and saw me, and told me to sit
down.

772
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:23,619
It took me an hour to win that chess game.

773
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:27,930
'Just who are you?' he said after the game.

774
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,799
'Forrest Gump,' I said.

775
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,599
'Where did you learn to play chess?' he asked.

776
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:41,309
'In the jungle,' I told him.

777
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:44,009
He looked surprised.

778
01:03:44,009 --> 01:03:47,430
'Aren't you in the tournament?' he asked.

779
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,289
'No,' I told him.

780
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:55,240
'I'm going home, and I'm going to start a
shrimp business.'

781
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,259
'You can make a lot of money from chess,'
he said.

782
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:01,079
'You're very good.'

783
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:03,200
'Am I?'

784
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,319
I said.

785
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:09,519
The old man's name was Mr Tribble.

786
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:16,020
Two days later we were on our way to Los Angeles,
to a big chess tournament.

787
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,020
***

788
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:23,609
We were a day or two early for the tournament,
and Mr Tribble took me to see some people

789
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,960
who were making a film.

790
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,480
They make a lot of films in Los Angeles.

791
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,480
We were watching a man who was crashing through
a window in a film fight, when a man walked

792
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,069
over to us.

793
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:43,660
'Are you an actor?' he asked me.

794
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,260
'Who, me?'

795
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,819
I said.

796
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:51,230
'We're here for the chess tournament,' said
Mr Tribble.

797
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:56,089
But the other man was looking at me.

798
01:04:56,089 --> 01:05:02,200
'You are a big, strong man, aren't you?' he
said.

799
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,470
'You're just what I need for a film that I'm
making.

800
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,279
My name is Felder.'

801
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:14,250
'He has to play chess in a tournament tomorrow,'
said Mr Tribble.

802
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,240
'He hasn't got time to be an actor.'

803
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:22,250
'It won't take long,' said Mr Felder.

804
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:30,339
So we went with Mr Felder, and I found myself
acting in a film about the jungle - with Raquel

805
01:05:30,339 --> 01:05:33,960
Welch, the famous film star!

806
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,130
'Is that really Raquel Welch?'

807
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:39,310
I asked Mr Felder.

808
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,349
But things did not go well.

809
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:50,180
Somehow, when I was helping Miss Welch to
escape from the jungle, her dress came off

810
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,050
and I had to run into the trees to hide her.

811
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,660
But who do you think we met there?

812
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,660
Sue, the ape!

813
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:58,839
He was in another film!

814
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:09,509
The three of us ran out of there fast, and
Miss Welch shouted and screamed.

815
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:13,490
No, things didn't go very well.

816
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:17,769
I wasn't an actor for very long.

817
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:21,760
I think Mr Tribble was secretly pleased.

818
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,609
I was pleased because I was back with Sue
again.

819
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:27,609
***

820
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:36,640
Back at our hotel, the three of us sat in
our room and tried to decide what to do.

821
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:42,580
'It's going to be difficult travelling with
an ape,' said Mr Tribble.

822
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,349
'He won't be any trouble, Mr Tribble,' I said.

823
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:48,710
But Mr Tribble seemed worried.

824
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:55,450
Next day was the big chess tournament at the
Beverly Hills Hotel.

825
01:06:55,450 --> 01:07:02,500
Mr Tribble and I got there early, and I had
to play chess all day.

826
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:10,480
It took me about seven minutes to win the
first game, and half an hour to win the next.

827
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,009
I played all that day, and the next.

828
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:23,020
And suddenly I was in the final, playing with
a Russian, Honest Ivan, the best player in

829
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,020
the world.

830
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:31,099
He was a big man, with long black hair, and
he didn't want to lose!

831
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:34,900
It was a long game.

832
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,650
Honest Ivan was good - very good.

833
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:46,950
But just when Honest Ivan seemed to be winning,
Sue ran across the room and jumped onto the

834
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:48,049
chess table!

835
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:56,460
Honest Ivan fell off his chair, and everybody
started screaming and running everywhere.

836
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:00,430
'Let's get out of here, Forrest!'

837
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,559
shouted Mr Tribble.

838
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:07,730
We got back to the hotel and hurried up to
our room.

839
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:16,190
'Forrest,' said Mr Tribble, 'You're a wonderful
chess player, but I never know what's going

840
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,770
to happen next!

841
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:23,650
Here's half of the money that you've won - it's
almost five thousand dollars.

842
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:30,460
Take Sue back to Alabama with you, and start
your shrimp business.'

843
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:34,090
He shook my hand and gave me his address.

844
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:39,390
'Write to me sometimes, Forrest.

845
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,670
Good luck!'

846
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,411
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Shrimp Business

847
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:54,271
Well, I finally went home to Mobile again.

848
01:08:54,271 --> 01:08:59,060
The train got into Mobile station about three
o'clock in the morning, and Sue and I got

849
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,560
off.

850
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,940
We walked into the town and finally found
a place to sleep in an empty building.

851
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:13,410
The next morning I bought some breakfast and
got Sue some bananas to eat.

852
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:16,560
Then we went to see Mom.

853
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,170
She was pleased to see me.

854
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:26,330
'Oh, Forrest,' she said, 'you're home at last!'

855
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,010
'Yes, Mom,' I said.

856
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,910
But I didn't stay long.

857
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:39,480
Two days later, Sue and I got the bus to Bayou
La Batre, where Bubba's parents lived, and

858
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:45,580
I explained to Bubba's daddy about the shrimp
business that Bubba and I planned to start

859
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,370
after we came out of the army.

860
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:52,780
He listened, and he was very interested.

861
01:09:52,780 --> 01:10:00,700
And the next day he took Sue and me out in
his little boat, to look for a good place

862
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,200
to start the shrimp business.

863
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:12,580
It took almost a month to start things up
- to get nets, and a boat, and everything.

864
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:19,070
Finally the day came when Sue and I were ready
to go shrimping.

865
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:25,230
And by that night we had hundreds and hundreds
of shrimps in our nets!

866
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:30,310
It was the beginning of my shrimp business.

867
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:36,800
We worked hard, all that summer, and that
autumn and winter and the next spring.

868
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:45,530
And after a year, Mom was working for me,
and Mr Tribble, and Curtis (my old football

869
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:47,520
friend), and Bubba's daddy.

870
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:55,010
At the end of that year, we had thirty thousand
dollars!

871
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:57,680
Everybody was very happy.

872
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,140
But me?

873
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:02,580
I was thinking of Jenny, of course.

874
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,050
I wanted to find her again.

875
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:13,780
And one day I dressed in my best clothes and
got the bus to Mobile, and I went to Jenny's

876
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,650
Mom's house.

877
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:21,370
'Forrest Gump!' she said, when she saw me.

878
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:24,430
'Come on in!'

879
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:30,520
Well, we talked about Mom and the shrimp business
and everything.

880
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,890
Then I asked about Jenny.

881
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:38,430
'I don't hear from her very often,' she said.

882
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:43,640
'I think they live somewhere in North Carolina
now.'

883
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,180
'They?'

884
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,380
I said.

885
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,860
Didn't you know?'

886
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,680
she said.

887
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,740
'Jenny married two years ago;

888
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,740
***

889
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,890
Why wasn't I ready for that news?

890
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,580
I don't know, but I wasn't.

891
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,180
And part of me seemed to die when I heard
it.

892
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:09,420
But Jenny only did what she had to do.

893
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,750
Because I'm an idiot.

894
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:17,660
A lot of people say that they married an idiot,
but they don't know what it's like to marry

895
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,370
a real one.

896
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:24,530
I cried that night, but it didn't help.

897
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:29,920
'I'm just going to work hard,' I told myself.

898
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,590
'It's all I can do.'

899
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,030
And I did.

900
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:39,660
And at the end of that year we had seventy-five
thousand dollars.

901
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,660
***

902
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:41,720
Time went on.

903
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:49,830
I looked in the mirror and saw lines on my
face and grey in my hair.

904
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:57,920
The business was doing well, but I asked myself,
'What are you doing all this for?'

905
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,390
And I knew that I had to get away.

906
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:06,060
Mr Tribble understood.

907
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:12,760
'Why don't you tell everybody that you're
taking a long holiday, Forrest?' he said.

908
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,150
'The business will be here when you want it
again.'

909
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:20,470
So I did.

910
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:24,390
Sue came with me, and we went to the bus station.

911
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:30,050
'Where do you want to go?' the woman in the
ticket office asked.

912
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,461
'I don't know,' I said.

913
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:36,890
'Why don't you go to Savannah?'

914
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,650
she said.

915
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:42,400
'It's a nice town.'

916
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,550
'OK,' I said.

917
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:48,830
CHAPTER TWELVE
Little Forrest

918
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:59,440
Sue and I got off the bus at Savannah, then
I went and got a cup of coffee and sat outside

919
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,870
the bus station.

920
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,580
What could I do next?

921
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:06,760
I didn't know.

922
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:13,800
So after I finished my cup of coffee, I took
out my harmonica and began to play.

923
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:21,090
I played two songs - and a man walked past
and threw some money into my empty coffee

924
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,090
cup!

925
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:29,250
I played two more songs, and soon the cup
was half full of money!

926
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:34,520
By the end of the next week, we were getting
ten dollars a day.

927
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:41,700
Then, one afternoon when I was playing to
some people in the park, I noticed that a

928
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,960
little boy was watching me carefully.

929
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:50,100
Then I looked up and saw a woman who was standing
near him.

930
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,630
It was Jenny Curran.

931
01:14:52,630 --> 01:15:01,450
Her hair was different, and she looked a bit
older, and a bit tired, but it was her all

932
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,450
right.

933
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:09,020
And when I finished playing, she held the
little boy's hand and came across.

934
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,910
She was smiling.

935
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:18,140
'Oh, Forrest, I knew it was you when I heard
that harmonica.

936
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,850
Nobody plays the harmonica like you do.'

937
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,820
'What are you doing here?'

938
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,890
I asked her.

939
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:29,710
'We live here now,' she said.

940
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:33,480
'Donald works in a business here in Savannah.

941
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,920
We came here about three years ago.'

942
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:42,310
When I stopped playing, the rest of the people
walked away.

943
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:47,320
Jenny sat next to me while the little boy
started playing with Sue.

944
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:54,960
'Why are you playing your harmonica in the
park?' asked Jenny.

945
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:00,580
'Mom wrote and told me about your shrimp business,
and how rich you were.'

946
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,780
'It's a long story,' I said.

947
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:07,650
'Is that your little boy?'

948
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,800
'Yes,' she said.

949
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,160
'What do you call him?'

950
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:18,420
'His name is Forrest,' she said quietly.

951
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:24,620
Then she went on, 'He's half yours.

952
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,560
He's your son, Forrest.'

953
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,670
I looked at the boy, who was still playing
with Sue.

954
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,670
'My... son?'

955
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:44,870
'I knew that a baby was on the way when I
left Indianapolis,' said Jenny, 'but I didn't

956
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:45,870
want to say anything.

957
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:49,030
I don't know why.

958
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,870
I was worried that perhaps -'

959
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:57,940
'Perhaps he would be an idiot,' I finished
for her.

960
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,830
'Yes.

961
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:04,340
But Forrest, he's not an idiot, he's really
clever.'

962
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,830
'Are you sure that he's mine?'

963
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:10,660
I asked.

964
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:14,330
'I'm sure,' said Jenny.

965
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:18,190
'He wants to be a football player.'

966
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:19,820
I looked at the boy.

967
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:23,820
'Can I see him for a minute or two?'

968
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:29,220
'Of course,' said Jenny, and she called to
him.

969
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:34,100
'Forrest, I want you to meet another Forrest.

970
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,170
He's an old friend of mine.'

971
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:41,120
The boy came and sat down.

972
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,290
'What a funny animal you've got,' he said.

973
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,170
'He's an ape,' I said.

974
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,430
'His name is Sue.'

975
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:54,970
'Why is it called Sue if it's a he?'

976
01:17:54,970 --> 01:18:00,620
I knew then that I didn't have an idiot for
a son.

977
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:06,200
'Your Mom tells me that you want to be a football
player.'

978
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,390
'Yes,' he said.

979
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:12,760
'Do you know anything about football?'

980
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,670
'A bit,' I said.

981
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,580
'But ask your daddy.

982
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:22,220
He'll know more than me.'

983
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:29,210
He put his arms round me for a second, then
went off to play with Sue again.

984
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,360
Jenny looked at me.

985
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,160
'How long have we been friends, Forrest?

986
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,170
Thirty years?

987
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,580
Sometimes it doesn't seem true.'

988
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:45,640
She moved nearer, and gave me a kiss.

989
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,220
'Idiots,' said Jenny.

990
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:52,370
'Who isn't an idiot?'

991
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:59,660
Then she got up and held little Forrest's
hand, and they walked away.

992
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,660
***

993
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:04,580
Well, after that, I did a few things.

994
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:12,120
First I phoned Mr Tribble and told him to
give some of my money from the shrimp business

995
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,060
to my Mom, and some to Bubba's daddy.

996
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:23,100
'Then send the rest to Jenny and little Forrest,'
I said.

997
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,130
That night I sat up thinking.

998
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:34,120
'Perhaps I can put things right with Jenny,'
I thought, 'now that I've found her again.'

999
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:41,680
But the more I thought about it, the more
I finally understood that it was better for

1000
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:48,120
the boy to be with Jenny and her husband,
and not to have an idiot for a father.

1001
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,570
An idiot?

1002
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,460
Yes, I'm an idiot.

1003
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:57,390
But most of the time I just try to do the
right thing.

1004
01:19:57,390 --> 01:19:58,390
- THE END -

1005
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,396
Hope you have enjoyed the reading!
