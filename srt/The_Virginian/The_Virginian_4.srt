1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Breakfast was something I had forgotten, and one of them was
cooking it now in the dry shelter of the stable.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:22,480
He was alone, because the talking and the steps were outside the stable, and
I could hear the sounds of horses being driven into the corral and saddled.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Then I perceived that the coffee was ready, and almost immediately
the cook called them.

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:47,680
One came in, shutting the door behind him as he reentered, which the rest as they followed imitated; for at
each opening of the door I saw the light of day leap into the stable and heard the louder sounds of the rain.

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:04,280
Then the sound and the light would again be shut out, until someone at length
spoke out bluntly, bidding the door be left open on account of the smoke.

6
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,960
What were they hiding from? he asked.

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,320
The runaways that had escaped?

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,480
A laugh followed this sally, and the door was left open.

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,840
Thus I learned that there had been more thieves than the two
that were captured.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,920
It gave a little more ground for their suspicion about me and
my anxiety to pass the night elsewhere.

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,560
It cost nothing to detain me, and they were taking no chances,
however remote.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,560
The fresh air and the light now filled the stable, and I lay
listening while their breakfast brought more talk from them.

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:51,000
They were more at ease now than was I, who had nothing to do but carry out my role of slumber in the stall;
they spoke in a friendly, ordinary way, as if this were like every other morning of the week to them.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,960
They addressed the prisoners with a sort of fraternal kindness, not bringing
them pointedly into the conversation, nor yet pointedly leaving them out.

15
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:13,600
I made out that they must all be sitting round the breakfast
together, those who had to die and those who had to kill them.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
The Virginian I never heard speak.

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,120
But I heard the voice of Steve; he discussed with his captors
the sundry points of his capture.

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
“Do you remember a haystack?” he asked.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
“Away up the south fork of Gros Ventre?”

20
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
“That was Thursday afternoon,” said one of the captors.

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,320
“There was a shower.”

22
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,960
“Yes. It rained. We had you fooled that time. I was laying on
the ledge above to report your movements.”

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
Several of them laughed.

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,920
“We thought you were over on Spread Creek then.”

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,160
“I figured you thought so by the trail you left after the stack.


26
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
Saturday we watched you turn your back on us up Spread Creek.


27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
We were snug among the trees the other side of Snake River.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
That was another time we had you fooled.”

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080
They laughed again at their own expense.

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
I have heard men pick to pieces a hand of whist with more antagonism.


31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Steve continued: “Would we head for Idaho?

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,520
Would we swing back over the Divide?

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
You didn’t know which!

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:14,000
And when we generalled you on to that band of horses you thought
was the band you were hunting⁠—ah, we were a strong combination!”

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,120
He broke off with the first touch of bitterness I had felt in
his words.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,800
“Nothing is any stronger than its weakest point.”

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,880
It was the Virginian who said this, and it was the first word
he had spoken.

38
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
“Naturally,” said Steve.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,880
His tone in addressing the Virginian was so different, so curt,
that I supposed he took the weakest point to mean himself.

40
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,320
But the others now showed me that I was wrong in this explanation.


41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,560
“That’s so,” one said.

42
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,840
“Its weakest point is where a rope or a gang of men is going
to break when the strain comes.

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
And you was linked with a poor partner, Steve.”

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,800
“You’re right I was,” said the prisoner, back in his easy, casual
voice.

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,920
“You ought to have got yourself separated from him, Steve.”

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,440
There was a pause.

47
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
“Yes,” said the prisoner, moodily.

48
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
“I’m sitting here because one of us blundered.”

49
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
He cursed the blunderer.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,600
“Lighting his fool fire queered the whole deal,” he added.

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,440
As he again heavily cursed the blunderer, the others murmured
to each other various I told you so’s.

52
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,560
“You’d never have built that fire, Steve,” said one.

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,600
“I said that when we spied the smoke,” said another.

54
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,120
“I said, ‘That’s none of Steve’s work, lighting fires and revealing
to us their whereabouts.’”

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,640
It struck me that they were plying Steve with compliments.

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,880
“Pretty hard to have the fool get away and you get caught,” a
third suggested.

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
At this they seemed to wait.

58
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,920
I felt something curious in all this last talk.

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,960
“Oh, did he get away?” said the prisoner, then.

60
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Again they waited; and a new voice spoke huskily:⁠—

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,120
“I built that fire, boys.”

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
It was the prisoner in the gray flannel shirt.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
“Too late, Ed,” they told him kindly.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,920
“You ain’t a good liar.”

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,080
“What makes you laugh, Steve?” said someone.

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,560
“Oh, the things I notice.”

67
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,680
“Meaning Ed was pretty slow in backing up your play?

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
The joke is really on you, Steve.

69
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,000
You’d ought never to have cursed the fire-builder if you wanted
us to believe he was present.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
But we’d not have done much to Shorty, even if we had caught
him.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:29,080
All he wants is to be scared good and hard, and he’ll go back into
virtuousness, which is his nature when not travelling with Trampas.”

72
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,760
Steve’s voice sounded hard now.

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,200
“You have caught Ed and me. That should satisfy you for one gather.”


74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,480
“Well, we think different, Steve. Trampas escaping leaves this
thing unfinished.”

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,720
“So Trampas escaped too, did he?” said the prisoner.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,280
“Yes, Steve, Trampas escaped⁠—this time; and Shorty with him⁠—this
time.

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,880
We know it most as well as if we’d seen them go.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:05,840
And we’re glad Shorty is loose, for he’ll build another fire or do some
other foolishness next time, and that’s the time we’ll get Trampas.”

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,720
Their talk drifted to other points, and I lay thinking of the
skirmish that had played beneath the surface of their banter.

80
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes, the joke, as they put it, was on Steve.

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,960
He had lost one point in the game to them.

82
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,120
They were playing for names.

83
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,640
He, being a chivalrous thief, was playing to hide names.

84
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:36,720
They could only, among several likely confederates, guess Trampas
and Shorty.

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,200
So it had been a slip for him to curse the man who built the
fire.

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
At least, they so held it.

87
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,880
For, they with subtlety reasoned, one curses the absent.

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:07:00,480
And I agreed with them that Ed did not know how to lie well; he should
have at once claimed the disgrace of having spoiled the expedition.

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:10,760
If Shorty was the blunderer, then certainly Trampas was the
other man; for the two were as inseparable as don and master.

90
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,200
Trampas had enticed Shorty away from good, and trained him in
evil.

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:23,520
It now struck me that after his single remark the Virginian had
been silent throughout their shrewd discussion.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,440
It was the other prisoner that I heard them next address.

93
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,680
“You don’t eat any breakfast, Ed.”

94
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,080
“Brace up, Ed. Look at Steve, how hardy he eats!”

95
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,080
But Ed, it seemed, wanted no breakfast.

96
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,600
And the tin dishes rattled as they were gathered and taken to
be packed.

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,680
“Drink this coffee, anyway,” another urged; “you’ll feel warmer.”


98
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,360
These words almost made it seem like my own execution.

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:01,080
My whole body turned cold in company with the prisoner’s, and as
if with a clank the situation tightened throughout my senses.

100
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,240
“I reckon if everyone’s ready we’ll start.”

101
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,120
It was the Virginian’s voice once more, and different from the
rest.

102
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,200
I heard them rise at his bidding, and I put the blanket over
my head.

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,760
I felt their tread as they walked out, passing my stall.

104
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:32,400
The straw that was half under me and half out in the stable was
stirred as by something heavy dragged or half lifted along over it.

105
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:42,120
“Look out, you’re hurting Ed’s arm,” one said to another, as
the steps with tangled sounds passed slowly out.

106
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:50,120
I heard another among those who followed say, “Poor Ed couldn’t
swallow his coffee.”

107
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:59,680
Outside they began getting on their horses; and next their hoofs grew distant,
until all was silence round the stable except the dull, even falling of the rain.

108
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,760
CHAPTER XXXI

109
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,840
The Cottonwoods

110
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,280
I do not know how long I stayed there alone.

111
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:17,760
It was the Virginian who came back, and as he stood at the foot of my
blankets his eye, after meeting mine full for a moment, turned aside.

112
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:31,080
I had never seen him look as he did now, not even in Pitchstone
Canyon when we came upon the bodies of Hank and his wife.

113
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Until this moment we had found no chance of speaking together,
except in the presence of others.

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,800
“Seems to be raining still,” I began after a little.

115
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,160
“Yes. It’s a wet spell.”

116
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,840
He stared out of the door, smoothing his mustache.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,280
It was again I that spoke.

118
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
“What time is it?”

119
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,960
He brooded over his watch.

120
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
“Twelve minutes to seven.”

121
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,920
I rose and stood drawing on my clothes.

122
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,080
“The fire’s out,” said he; and he assembled some new sticks over
the ashes.

123
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,200
Presently he looked round with a cup.

124
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,240
“Never mind that for me,” I said.

125
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,920
“We’ve a long ride,” he suggested.

126
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,760
“I know. I’ve crackers in my pocket.”

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,680
My boots being pulled on, I walked to the door and watched the
clouds.

128
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,240
“They seem as if they might lift,” I said.

129
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,480
And I took out my watch.

130
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,800
“What time is it?” he asked.

131
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,000
“A quarter of⁠—it’s run down.”

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,480
While I wound it he seemed to be consulting his own.

133
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
“Well?” I inquired.

134
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
“Ten minutes past seven.”

135
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,240
As I was setting my watch he slowly said:

136
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,080
“Steve wound his all regular. I had to night-guard him till two.”


137
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,280
His speech was like that of one in a trance: so, at least, it
sounds in my memory today.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Again I looked at the weather and the rainy immensity of the
plain.

139
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,320
The foothills eastward where we were going were a soft yellow.


140
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Over the gray-green sagebrush moved shapeless places of light⁠—not yet the uncovered sunlight, but spots
where the storm was wearing thin; and wandering streams of warmth passed by slowly in the surrounding air.

141
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,040
As I watched the clouds and the earth, my eyes chanced to fall
on the distant clump of cottonwoods.

142
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:39,880
Vapors from the enfeebled storm floated round them, and they were
indeed far away; but I came inside and began rolling up my blankets.

143
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,960
“You will not change your mind?” said the Virginian by the fire.


144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,840
“It is thirty-five miles.”

145
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,200
I shook my head, feeling a certain shame that he should see how
unnerved I was.

146
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:03,320
He swallowed a hot cupful, and after it sat thinking; and
presently he passed his hand across his brow, shutting his eyes.

147
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:10,600
Again he poured out a cup, and emptying this, rose abruptly to
his feet as if shaking himself free from something.

148
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,880
“Let’s pack and quit here,” he said.

149
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,240
Our horses were in the corral and our belongings in the shelter
of what had been once the cabin at this forlorn place.

150
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:33,080
He collected them in silence while I saddled my own animal, and in silence we packed
the two packhorses, and threw the diamond hitch, and hauled tight the slack, damp ropes.

151
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:40,680
Soon we had mounted, and as we turned into the trail I gave a
look back at my last night’s lodging.

152
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,520
The Virginian noticed me.

153
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,320
“Goodbye forever!” he interpreted.

154
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,120
“By God, I hope so!”

155
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,560
“Same here,” he confessed.

156
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
And these were our first natural words this morning.

157
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:06,400
“This will go well,” said I, holding my flask out to him; and both
of us took some, and felt easier for it and the natural words.

158
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:22,840
For an hour we had been shirking real talk, holding fast to the weather, or anything, and all the while that
silent thing we were keeping off spoke plainly in the air around us and in every syllable that we uttered.

159
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,600
But now we were going to get away from it; leave it behind in
the stable, and set ourselves free from it by talking it out.

160
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Already relief had begun to stir in my spirits.

161
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,640
“You never did this before,” I said.

162
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,360
“No. I never had it to do.”

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,760
He was riding beside me, looking down at his saddle-horn.

164
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,120
“I do not think I should ever be able,” I pursued.

165
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,160
Defiance sounded in his answer.

166
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,760
“I would do it again this morning.”

167
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,360
“Oh, I don’t mean that. It’s all right here. There’s no other
way.”

168
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,760
“I would do it all over again the same this morning. Just the
same.”

169
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,160
“Why, so should I⁠—if I could do it at all.”

170
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,920
I still thought he was justifying their justice to me.

171
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,440
He made no answer as he rode along, looking all the while at
his saddle.

172
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:13,200
But again he passed his hand over his forehead with that frown
and shutting of the eyes.

173
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,720
“I should like to be sure I should behave myself if I were condemned,”
I said next.

174
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,000
For it now came to me⁠—which should I resemble?

175
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,440
Could I read the newspaper, and be interested in county elections,
and discuss coming death as if I had lost a game of cards?

176
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,280
Or would they have to drag me out?

177
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,400
That poor wretch in the gray flannel shirt⁠—“It was bad in the
stable,” I said aloud.

178
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,480
For an after-shiver of it went through me.

179
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,520
A third time his hand brushed his forehead, and I ventured some
sympathy.

180
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
“I’m afraid your head aches.”

181
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
“I don’t want to keep seeing Steve,” he muttered.

182
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,880
“Steve!” I was astounded.

183
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,400
“Why he⁠—why all I saw of him was splendid. Since it had to be.
It was⁠—”

184
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,560
“Oh, yes; Ed. You’re thinking about him. I’d forgot him. So you
didn’t enjoy Ed?”

185
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,680
At this I looked at him blankly.

186
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,200
“It isn’t possible that⁠—”

187
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,640
Again he cut me short with a laugh almost savage.

188
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,840
“You needn’t to worry about Steve. He stayed game.”

189
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:34,400
What then had been the matter that he should keep seeing Steve⁠—that his vision
should so obliterate from him what I still shivered at, and so shake him now?

190
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,640
For he seemed to be growing more stirred as I grew less.

191
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:49,720
I asked him no further questions, however, and we went on for several minutes, he brooding always
in the same fashion, until he resumed with the hard indifference that had before surprised me:⁠—

192
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,680
“So Ed gave you feelings! Dumb ague and so forth.”

193
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,400
“No doubt we’re not made the same way,” I retorted.

194
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,720
He took no notice of this.

195
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,560
“And you’d have been more comfortable if he’d acted same as Steve
did.

196
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,480
It cert’nly was bad seeing Ed take it that way, I reckon.

197
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,600
And you didn’t see him when the time came for business.

198
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:22,720
Well, here’s what it is: a man may be such a confirmed miscreant that killing’s the only cure for him; but still
he’s your own species, and you don’t want to have him fall around and grab your laigs and show you his fear naked.

199
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,680
It makes you feel ashamed.

200
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,000
So Ed gave you feelings, and Steve made everything right easy
for you!”

201
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,080
There was irony in his voice as he surveyed me, but it fell away
at once into sadness.

202
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,440
“Both was miscreants. But if Steve had played the coward, too,
it would have been a whole heap easier for me.”

203
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,320
He paused before adding, “And Steve was not a miscreant once.”


204
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:59,200
His voice had trembled, and I felt the deep emotion that seemed to gain
upon him now that action was over and he had nothing to do but think.

205
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,600
And his view was simple enough: you must die brave.

206
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,680
Failure is a sort of treason to the brotherhood, and forfeits
pity.

207
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:18,760
It was Steve’s perfect bearing that had caught his heart so that
he forgot even his scorn of the other man.

208
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,440
But this was by no means all that was to come.

209
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:28,960
He harked back to that notion of a prisoner helping to make it
easy for his executioner.

210
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,760
“Easy plumb to the end,” he pursued, his mind reviewing the acts
of the morning.

211
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,040
“Why, he tried to give me your newspaper. I didn’t⁠—”

212
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,400
“Oh, no,” I said hastily.

213
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,560
“I had finished with it.”

214
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,760
“Well, he took dying as naturally as he took living. Like a man
should. Like I hope to.”

215
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,240
Again he looked at the pictures in his mind.

216
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,520
“No playacting nor last words.

217
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:05,680
He just told goodbye to the boys as we led his horse under the
limb⁠—you needn’t to look so dainty,” he broke off.

218
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,120
“You ain’t going to get any more shocking particulars.”

219
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,880
“I know I’m white-livered,” I said with a species of laugh.

220
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,040
“I never crowd and stare when somebody is hurt in the street.
I get away.”

221
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
He thought this over.

222
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,640
“You don’t mean all of that.

223
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:33,000
You’d not have spoke just that way about crowding and staring
if you thought well of them that stare.

224
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,400
Staring ain’t courage; it’s trashy curiosity.

225
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,520
Now you did not have this thing⁠—”

226
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:49,640
He had stretched out his hand to point, but it fell, and his
utterance stopped, and he jerked his horse to a stand.

227
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,400
My nerves sprang like a wire at his suddenness, and I looked
where he was looking.

228
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
There were the cottonwoods, close in front of us.

229
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,000
As we had travelled and talked we had forgotten them.

230
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,160
Now they were looming within a hundred yards; and our trail lay
straight through them.

231
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,640
“Let’s go around them,” said the Virginian.

232
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,640
When we had come back from our circuit into the trail he continued:
“You did not have that thing to do.

233
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,600
But a man goes through with his responsibilities⁠—and I reckon
you could.”

234
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
“I hope so,” I answered.

235
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,360
“How about Ed?”

236
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,200
“He was not a man, though we thought he was till this.

237
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:41,600
Steve and I started punching cattle together at the Bordeaux
outfit, north of Cheyenne.

238
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,280
We did everything together in those days⁠—work and play.

239
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
Six years ago.

240
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,880
Steve had many good points onced.”

241
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
We must have gone two miles before he spoke again.

242
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,760
“You prob’ly didn’t notice Steve? I mean the way he acted to
me?”

243
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,560
It was a question, but he did not wait for my answer.

244
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,400
“Steve never said a word to me all through.

245
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,880
He shunned it.

246
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,320
And you saw how neighborly he talked to the other boys.”

247
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,240
“Where have they all gone?” I asked.

248
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,400
He smiled at me.

249
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,200
“It cert’nly is lonesome now, for a fact.”

250
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,600
“I didn’t know you felt it,” said I.

251
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
“Feel it!⁠—they’ve went to the railroad.

252
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:35,640
Three of them are witnesses in a case at Evanston, and the Judge
wants our outfit at Medicine Bow.

253
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,600
Steve shunned me.

254
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,000
Did he think I was going back on him?”

255
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,040
“What if he did? You were not. And so nobody’s going to Wind
River but you?”

256
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,360
“No.

257
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,720
Did you notice Steve would not give us any information about
Shorty?

258
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
That was right.

259
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,360
I would have acted that way, too.”

260
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,920
Thus, each time, he brought me back to the subject.

261
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:07,040
The sun was now shining warm during two or three minutes together,
and gulfs of blue opened in the great white clouds.

262
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:18,000
These moved and met among each other, and parted, like hands spread out,
slowly weaving a spell of sleep over the day after the wakeful night storm.

263
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,040
The huge contours of the earth lay basking and drying, and not
one living creature, bird or beast, was in sight.

264
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,360
Quiet was returning to my revived spirits, but there was none
for the Virginian.

265
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,080
And as he reasoned matters out aloud, his mood grew more overcast.


266
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,360
“You have a friend, and his ways are your ways.

267
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,720
You travel together, you spree together confidentially, and you
suit each other down to the ground.

268
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Then one day you find him putting his iron on another man’s calf.


269
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,720
You tell him fair and square those ways have never been your
ways and ain’t going to be your ways.

270
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,520
Well, that does not change him any, for it seems he’s disturbed
over getting rich quick and being a big man in the Territory.

271
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:04,760
And the years go on, until you are foreman of Judge Henry’s ranch
and he⁠—is dangling back in the cottonwoods.

272
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,800
What can he claim?

273
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,920
Who made the choice?

274
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,840
He cannot say, ‘Here is my old friend that I would have stood
by.’

275
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,920
Can he say that?”

276
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,360
“But he didn’t say it,” I protested.

277
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
“No. He shunned me.”

278
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,920
“Listen,” I said.

279
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,800
“Suppose while you were on guard he had whispered, ‘Get me off’⁠—would
you have done it?”

280
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,400
“No, sir!” said the Virginian, hotly.

281
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
“Then what do you want?” I asked.

282
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,120
“What did you want?”

283
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,160
He could not answer me⁠—but I had not answered him, I saw; so
I pushed it farther.

284
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,920
“Did you want endorsement from the man you were hanging? That’s
asking a little too much.”

285
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,280
But he had now another confusion.

286
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,520
“Steve stood by Shorty,” he said musingly.

287
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,120
“It was Shorty’s mistake cost him his life, but all the same
he didn’t want us to catch⁠—”

288
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,920
“You are mixing things,” I interrupted.

289
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,280
“I never heard you mix things before. And it was not Shorty’s
mistake.”

290
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
He showed momentary interest.

291
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,520
“Whose then?”

292
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,320
“The mistake of whoever took a fool into their enterprise.”

293
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,640
“That’s correct. Well, Trampas took Shorty in, and Steve would
not tell on him either.”

294
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,120
I still tried it, saying, “They were all in the same boat.”

295
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,840
But logic was useless; he had lost his bearings in a fog of sentiment.


296
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:39,200
He knew, knew passionately, that he had done right; but the silence of his old
friend to him through those last hours left a sting that no reasoning could assuage.

297
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
“He told goodbye to the rest of the boys; but not to me.”

298
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,720
And nothing that I could point out in common sense turned him
from the thread of his own argument.

299
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
He worked round the circle again to self-justification.

300
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,480
“Was it him I was deserting?

301
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,080
Was not the deserting done by him the day I spoke my mind about
stealing calves?

302
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I have kept my ways the same.

303
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,200
He is the one that took to new ones.

304
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,800
The man I used to travel with is not the man back there.

305
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,320
Same name, to be sure.

306
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,120
And same body.

307
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,480
But different in⁠—and yet he had the memory!

308
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,320
You can’t never change your memory!”

309
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,120
He gave a sob.

310
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,280
It was the first I had ever heard from him, and before I knew what I was
doing I had reined my horse up to his and put my arm around his shoulders.

311
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,880
I had no sooner touched him than he was utterly overcome.

312
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,320
“I knew Steve awful well,” he said.

313
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:47,560
Thus we had actually come to change places; for early in the morning he had been firm
while I was unnerved, while now it was I who attempted to steady and comfort him.

314
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:56,040
I had the sense to keep silent, and presently he shook my hand,
not looking at me as he did so.

315
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,680
He was always very shy of demonstration.

316
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,880
And he took to patting the neck of his pony.

317
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,880
“You Monte hawss,” said he, “you think you are wise, but there’s
a lot of things you don’t savvy.”

318
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,680
Then he made a new beginning of talk between us.

319
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,280
“It is kind of pitiful about Shorty.”

320
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,640
“Very pitiful,” I said.

321
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,600
“Do you know about him?” the Virginian asked.

322
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:22,760
“I know there’s no real harm in him, and some real good, and
that he has not got the brains necessary to be a horse thief.”

323
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,080
“That’s so.

324
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,920
That’s very true.

325
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Trampas has led him in deeper than his stature can stand.

326
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,680
Now back East you can be middling and get along.

327
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,440
But if you go to try a thing on in this Western country, you’ve
got to do it well.

328
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:50,800
You’ve got to deal cyards well; you’ve got to steal well; and if you claim to be quick with your gun, you must
be quick, for you’re a public temptation, and some man will not resist trying to prove he is the quicker.

329
00:25:50,800 --> 00:26:00,680
You must break all the Commandments well in this Western country, and Shorty
should have stayed in Brooklyn, for he will be a novice his livelong days.

330
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,200
You don’t know about him?

331
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,080
He has told me his circumstances.

332
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,240
He don’t remember his father, and it was like he could have claimed
three or four.

333
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,720
And I expect his mother was not much interested in him before
or after he was born.

334
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,040
He ran around, and when he was eighteen he got to be help to
a grocery man.

335
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:38,360
But a girl he ran with kept taking all his pay and teasing him for more, and
so one day the grocery man caught Shorty robbing his till, and fired him.

336
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:46,160
There wasn’t no one to tell goodbye to, for the girl had to go
to the country to see her aunt, she said.

337
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,000
So Shorty hung around the store and kissed the grocery cat goodbye.


338
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,880
He’d been used to feeding the cat, and she’d sit in his lap and
purr, he told me.

339
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,800
He sends money back to that girl now.

340
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,080
This hyeh country is no country for Shorty, for he will be a
conspicuous novice all his days.”

341
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,200
“Perhaps he’ll prefer honesty after his narrow shave,” I said.


342
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
But the Virginian shook his head.

343
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,160
“Trampas has got hold of him.”

344
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,640
The day was now all blue above, and all warm and dry beneath.


345
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:35,480
We had begun to wind in and rise among the first slopes of the
foothills, and we had talked ourselves into silence.

346
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,680
At the first running water we made a long nooning, and I slept
on the bare ground.

347
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:57,960
My body was lodged so fast and deep in slumber that when the Virginian shook me awake I could not come back
to life at once; it was the clump of cottonwoods, small and far out in the plain below us, that recalled me.

348
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,040
“It’ll not be watching us much longer,” said the Virginian.

349
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:13,360
He made it a sort of joke; but I knew that both of us were glad when presently we rode
into a steeper country, and among its folds and carvings lost all sight of the plain.

350
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,120
He had not slept, I found.

351
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:26,360
His explanation was that the packs needed better balancing, and
after that he had gone up and down the stream on the chance of trout.

352
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:35,160
But his haunted eyes gave me the real reason⁠—they spoke of Steve,
no matter what he spoke of; it was to be no short thing with him.

353
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
CHAPTER XXXII

354
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,800
Superstition Trail

355
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,800
We did not make thirty-five miles that day, nor yet twenty-five,
for he had let me sleep.

356
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:58,040
We made an early camp and tried some unsuccessful fishing, over which he was
cheerful, promising trout tomorrow when we should be higher among the mountains.

357
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:12,040
He never again touched or came near the subject that was on his mind, but while I sat writing my
diary, he went off to his horse Monte, and I could hear that he occasionally talked to that friend.

358
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:24,520
Next day we swung southward from what is known to many as the Conant trail,
and headed for that shortcut through the Tetons which is known to but a few.

359
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:37,160
Bitch Creek was the name of the stream we now followed, and here there was such
good fishing that we idled; and the horses and I at least enjoyed ourselves.

360
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:51,600
For they found fresh pastures and shade in the now plentiful woods; and the mountain
odors and the mountain heights were enough for me when the fish refused to rise.

361
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,080
This road of ours now became the road which the pursuit had taken
before the capture.

362
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:08,400
Going along, I noticed the footprints of many hoofs, rain-blurred but
recent, and these were the tracks of the people I had met in the stable.

363
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,000
“You can notice Monte’s,” said the Virginian.

364
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
“He is the only one that has his hind feet shod.

365
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,760
There’s several trails from this point down to where we have
come from.”

366
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,560
We mounted now over a long slant of rock, smooth and of wide
extent.

367
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:32,680
Above us it went up easily into a little side canyon, but ahead, where
our way was, it grew so steep that we got off and led our horses.

368
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:41,880
This brought us to the next higher level of the mountain, a space of sagebrush
more open, where the rain-washed tracks appeared again in the softer ground.

369
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:50,560
“Someone has been here since the rain,” I called to the Virginian,
who was still on the rock, walking up behind the packhorses.

370
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,640
“Since the rain!” he exclaimed.

371
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,520
“That’s not two days yet.”

372
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,320
He came and examined the footprints.

373
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
“A man and a hawss,” he said, frowning.

374
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,360
“Going the same way we are. How did he come to pass us, and us
not see him?”

375
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,200
“One of the other trails,” I reminded him.

376
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,320
“Yes, but there’s not many that knows them. They are pretty rough
trails.”

377
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,120
“Worse than this one we’re taking?”

378
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,360
“Not much; only how does he come to know any of them?

379
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,520
And why don’t he take the Conant trail that’s open and easy and
not much longer?

380
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,400
One man and a hawss.

381
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I don’t see who he is or what he wants here.”

382
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
“Probably a prospector,” I suggested.

383
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,800
“Only one outfit of prospectors has ever been here, and they
claimed there was no mineral-bearing rock in these parts.”

384
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,520
We got back into our saddles with the mystery unsolved.

385
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:53,000
To the Virginian it was a greater one, apparently, than to me; why
should one have to account for every stray traveller in the mountains?

386
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,680
“That’s queer, too,” said the Virginian.

387
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,840
He was now riding in front of me, and he stopped, looking down
at the trail.

388
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,800
“Don’t you notice?”

389
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,240
It did not strike me.

390
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,520
“Why, he keeps walking beside his hawss; he don’t get on him.”


391
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:22,080
Now we, of course, had mounted at the beginning of the better
trail after the steep rock, and that was quite half a mile back.

392
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,920
Still, I had a natural explanation.

393
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,560
“He’s leading a packhorse. He’s a poor trapper, and walks.”

394
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:38,440
“Packhorses ain’t usually shod before and behind,” said the
Virginian; and sliding to the ground he touched the footprints.

395
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,280
“They are not four hours old,” said he.

396
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,560
“This bank’s in shadow by one o’clock, and the sun has not cooked
them dusty.”

397
00:32:46,560 --> 00:33:38,400
We continued on our way; and although it seemed no very particular thing to me that a man should choose to walk and lead his horse for a while⁠—I often did so to limber my muscles⁠—nevertheless I began to catch the Virginian’s uncertain feeling about this traveller whose steps had appeared on our path in mid-journey, as if he had alighted from the midair, and to remind
myself that he had come over the great face of rock from another trail and thus joined us, and that indigent trappers are to be found owning but a single horse and leading him with their belongings through the deepest solitudes of the mountains⁠—none of this quite brought back to me the comfort which had been mine since we left the cottonwoods out of sight down in the plain.

398
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,080
Hence I called out sharply, “What’s the matter now?” when the
Virginian suddenly stopped his horse again.

399
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:53,280
He looked down at the trail, and then he very slowly turned round
in his saddle and stared back steadily at me.

400
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,840
“There’s two of them,” he said.

401
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,680
“Two what?”

402
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,960
“I don’t know.”

403
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,560
“You must know whether it’s two horses or two men,” I said, almost
angrily.

404
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,120
But to this he made no answer, sitting quite still on his horse
and contemplating the ground.

405
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:21,160
The silence was fastening on me like a spell, and I spurred my
horse impatiently forward to see for myself.

406
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,000
The footprints of two men were there in the trail.

407
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,160
“What do you say to that?” said the Virginian.

408
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,240
“Kind of ridiculous, ain’t it?”

409
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,720
“Very quaint,” I answered, groping for the explanation.

410
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:46,920
There was no rock here to walk over and step from into the softer
trail.

411
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,680
These second steps came more out of the air than the first.

412
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:57,200
And my brain played me the evil trick of showing me a dead man
in a gray flannel shirt.

413
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,080
“It’s two, you see, travelling with one hawss, and they take
turns riding him.”

414
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:11,120
“Why, of course!” I exclaimed; and we went along for a few paces.


415
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,240
“There you are,” said the Virginian, as the trail proved him
right.

416
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,680
“Number one has got on. My God, what’s that?”

417
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:33,240
At a crashing in the woods very close to us we both flung round
and caught sight of a vanishing elk.

418
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:41,760
It left us confronted, smiling a little, and sounding each other
with our eyes.

419
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,720
“Well, we didn’t need him for meat,” said the Virginian.

420
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,600
“A spike-horn, wasn’t it?” said I.

421
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
“Yes, just a spike-horn.”

422
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,720
For a while now as we rode we kept up a cheerful conversation
about elk.

423
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,640
We wondered if we should meet many more close to the trail like
this; but it was not long before our words died away.

424
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:24,080
We had come into a veritable gulf of mountain peaks, sharp at their bare summits like teeth, holding fields of snow lower
down, and glittering still in full day up there, while down among our pines and parks the afternoon was growing sombre.

425
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:30,600
All the while the fresh hoofprints of the horse and the fresh
footprints of the man preceded us.

426
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,680
In the trees, and in the opens, across the levels, and up the
steeps, they were there.

427
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,200
And so they were not four hours old!

428
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,600
Were they so much?

429
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,160
Might we not, round some turn, come upon the makers of them?

430
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,760
I began to watch for this.

431
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:57,640
And again my brain played me an evil trick, against which I found myself actually reasoning
thus: if they took turns riding, then walking must tire them as it did me or any man.

432
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,120
And besides, there was a horse.

433
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:14,400
With such thoughts I combated the fancy that those footprints were being made immediately in front
of us all the while, and that they were the only sign of any presence which our eyes could see.

434
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
But my fancy overcame my thoughts.

435
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:28,920
It was shame only which held me from asking this question of the Virginian:
Had one horse served in both cases of Justice down at the cottonwoods?

436
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,880
I wondered about this.

437
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,320
One horse⁠—or had the strangling nooses dragged two saddles empty
at the same signal?

438
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,720
Most likely; and therefore these people up here⁠—Was I going
back to the nursery?

439
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,080
I brought myself up short.

440
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:59,160
And I told myself to be steady; there lurked in this brain-process which was going
on beneath my reason a threat worse than the childish apprehensions it created.

441
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:07,760
I reminded myself that I was a man grown, twenty-five years old,
and that I must not merely seem like one, but feel like one.

442
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,160
“You’re not afraid of the dark, I suppose?”

443
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,600
This I uttered aloud, unwittingly.

444
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,240
“What’s that?”

445
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,160
I started; but it was only the Virginian behind me.

446
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,520
“Oh, nothing. The air is getting colder up here.”

447
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,560
I had presently a great relief.

448
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:32,240
We came to a place where again this trail mounted so abruptly
that we once more got off to lead our horses.

449
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:42,400
So likewise had our predecessors done; and as I watched the two different
sets of footprints, I observed something and hastened to speak of it.

450
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,240
“One man is much heavier than the other.”

451
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,120
“I was hoping I’d not have to tell you that,” said the Virginian.


452
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,960
“You’re always ahead of me! Well, still my education is progressing.”


453
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,680
“Why, yes. You’ll equal an Injun if you keep on.”

454
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,080
It was good to be facetious; and I smiled to myself as I trudged
upward.

455
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:14,440
We came off the steep place, leaving the canyon beneath us, and
took to horseback.

456
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:23,760
And as we proceeded over the final gentle slant up to the rim of the great
basin that was set among the peaks, the Virginian was jocular once more.

457
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,760
“Pounds has got on,” said he, “and Ounces is walking.”

458
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:37,400
I glanced over my shoulder at him, and he nodded as he fixed
the weather-beaten crimson handkerchief round his neck.

459
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,080
Then he threw a stone at a pack animal that was delaying on the
trail.

460
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,040
“Damn your buckskin hide,” he drawled.

461
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,800
“You can view the scenery from the top.”

462
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:55,800
He was so natural, sitting loose in the saddle, and cursing in his
gentle voice, that I laughed to think what visions I had been harboring.

463
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,000
The two dead men riding one horse through the mountains vanished,
and I came back to every day.

464
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,240
“Do you think we’ll catch up with those people?” I asked.

465
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,120
“Not likely. They’re travelling about the same gait we are.”

466
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,920
“Ounces ought to be the best walker.”

467
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
“Up hill, yes. But Pounds will go down a-foggin’.”

468
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,840
We gained the rim of the basin.

469
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:26,680
It lay below us, a great cup of country⁠—rocks, woods, opens,
and streams.

470
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:40,520
The tall peaks rose like spires around it, magnificent and bare in the last
of the sun; and we surveyed this upper world, letting our animals get breath.

471
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:55,800
Our bleak, crumbled rim ran like a rampart between the towering tops, a half circle of five
miles or six, very wide in some parts, and in some shrinking to a scanty foothold, as here.

472
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,440
Here our trail crossed over it between two eroded and fantastic
shapes of stone, like mushrooms, or misshapen heads on pikes.

473
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,000
Banks of snow spread up here against the black rocks, but half
an hour would see us descended to the green and the woods.

474
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,080
I looked down, both of us looked down, but our forerunners were
not there.

475
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:22,680
“They’ll be camping somewhere in this basin, though,” said the
Virginian, staring at the dark pines.

476
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,800
“They have not come this trail by accident.”

477
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:36,680
A cold little wind blew down between our stone shapes, and upward
again, eddying.

478
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:47,080
And round a corner upward with it came fluttering a leaf of newspaper,
and caught against an edge close to me.

479
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,280
“What’s the latest?” inquired the Virginian from his horse.

480
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,000
For I had dismounted, and had picked up the leaf.

481
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
“Seems to be interesting,” I next heard him say.

482
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,360
“Can’t you tell a man what’s making your eyes bug out so?”

483
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:15,240
“Yes,” my voice replied to him, and it sounded like some stranger
speaking lightly near by; “oh, yes!

484
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,760
Decidedly interesting.”

485
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,880
My voice mimicked his pronunciation.

486
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,000
“It’s quite the latest, I imagine. You had better read it yourself.”


487
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,800
And I handed it to him with a smile, watching his countenance,
while my brain felt as if clouds were rushing through it.

488
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,880
I saw his eyes quietly run the headings over.

489
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,960
“Well?” he inquired, after scanning it on both sides.

490
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:54,440
“I don’t seem to catch the excitement. Fremont County is going
to hold elections. I see they claim Jake⁠—”

491
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,240
“It’s mine,” I cut him off.

492
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,880
“My own paper. Those are my pencil marks.”

493
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,320
I do not think that a microscope could have discerned a change
in his face.

494
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,920
“Oh,” he commented, holding the paper, and fixing it with a critical
eye.

495
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,920
“You mean this is the one you lent Steve, and he wanted to give
me to give back to you.

496
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,000
And so them are your own marks.”

497
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:29,160
For a moment more he held it judicially, as I have seen men hold
a contract upon whose terms they were finally passing.

498
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,480
“Well, you have got it back now, anyway.”

499
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,640
And he handed it to me.

500
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:45,120
“Only a piece of it!” I exclaimed, always lightly.

501
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,360
And as I took it from him his hand chanced to touch mine.

502
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,720
It was cold as ice.

503
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,880
“They ain’t through readin’ the rest,” he explained easily.

504
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,240
“Don’t you throw it away! After they’ve taken such trouble.”

505
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,720
“That’s true,” I answered.

506
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,480
“I wonder if it’s Pounds or Ounces I’m indebted to.”

507
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
Thus we made further merriment as we rode down into the great
basin.

508
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,680
Before us, the horse and boot tracks showed plain in the soft
slough where melted snow ran half the day.

509
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,480
“If it’s a paper chase,” said the Virginian, “they’ll drop no
more along here.”

510
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,600
“Unless it gets dark,” said I.

511
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,960
“We’ll camp before that. Maybe we’ll see their fire.”

512
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,640
We did not see their fire.

513
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:41,040
We descended in the chill silence, while the mushroom rocks grew
far and the sombre woods approached.

514
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:53,960
By a stream we got off where two banks sheltered us; for a bleak wind cut down over the crags now
and then, making the pines send out a great note through the basin, like breakers in a heavy sea.

515
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,840
But we made cozy in the tent.

516
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,960
We pitched the tent this night, and I was glad to have it shut
out the mountain peaks.

517
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,000
They showed above the banks where we camped; and in the starlight
their black shapes rose stark against the sky.

518
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,360
They, with the pines and the wind, were a bedroom too unearthly
this night.

519
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:16,240
And as soon as our supper dishes were washed we went inside to
our lantern and our game of cribbage.

520
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,720
“This is snug,” said the Virginian, as we played.

521
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,440
“That wind don’t get down here.”

522
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,320
“Smoking is snug, too,” said I.

523
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,600
And we marked our points for an hour, with no words save about
the cards.

524
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,040
“I’ll be pretty near glad when we get out of these mountains,”
said the Virginian.

525
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,120
“They’re most too big.”

526
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,000
The pines had altogether ceased; but their silence was as tremendous
as their roar had been.

527
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,840
“I don’t know, though,” he resumed.

528
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,560
“There’s times when the plains can be awful big, too.”

529
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,880
Presently we finished a hand, and he said, “Let me see that paper.”


530
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,520
He sat reading it apparently through, while I arranged my blankets
to make a warm bed.

531
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:02,760
Then, since the paper continued to absorb him, I got myself ready,
and slid between my blankets for the night.

532
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,280
“You’ll need another candle soon in that lantern,” said I.

533
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,440
He put the paper down.

534
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,480
“I would do it all over again,” he began.

535
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,960
“The whole thing just the same.

536
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,760
He knowed the customs of the country, and he played the game.


537
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,240
No call to blame me for the customs of the country.

538
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,560
You leave other folks’ cattle alone, or you take the consequences,
and it was all known to Steve from the start.

539
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
Would he have me take the Judge’s wages and give him the wink?


540
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,200
He must have changed a heap from the Steve I knew if he expected
that.

541
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,280
I don’t believe he expected that.

542
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,400
He knew well enough the only thing that would have let him off
would have been a regular jury.

543
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,600
For the thieves have got hold of the juries in Johnson County.


544
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,520
I would do it all over, just the same.”

545
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,200
The expiring flame leaped in the lantern, and fell blue.

546
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:12,880
He broke off in his words as if to arrange the light, but did not, sitting silent
instead, just visible, and seeming to watch the death struggle of the flame.

547
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:21,280
I could find nothing to say to him, and I believed he was now
winning his way back to serenity by himself.

548
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:34,240
He kept his outward man so nearly natural that I forgot about that cold touch of his hand,
and never guessed how far out from reason the tide of emotion was even now whirling him.

549
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,280
“I remember at Cheyenne onced,” he resumed.

550
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,240
And he told me of a Thanksgiving visit to town that he had made
with Steve.

551
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,720
“We was just colts then,” he said.

552
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:55,080
He dwelt on their coltish doings, their adventures sought and
wrought in the perfect fellowship of youth.

553
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:03,480
“For Steve and me most always hunted in couples back in them
gamesome years,” he explained.

554
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:18,960
And he fell into the elemental talk of sex, such talk as would be an elk’s or tiger’s; and spoken so by him,
simply and naturally, as we speak of the seasons, or of death, or of any actuality, it was without offense.

555
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,920
It would be offense should I repeat it.

556
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:32,280
Then, abruptly ending these memories of himself and Steve, he
went out of the tent, and I heard him dragging a log to the fire.

557
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:39,800
When it had blazed up, there on the tent wall was his shadow
and that of the log where he sat with his half-broken heart.

558
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:46,520
And all the while I supposed he was master of himself, and self-justified
against Steve’s omission to bid him goodbye.

559
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:54,880
I must have fallen asleep before he returned, for I remember
nothing except waking and finding him in his blankets beside me.

560
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,200
The fire shadow was gone, and gray, cold light was dimly on the
tent.

561
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,280
He slept restlessly, and his forehead was ploughed by lines of
pain.

562
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:12,040
While I looked at him he began to mutter, and suddenly started
up with violence.

563
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,160
“No!” he cried out; “no! Just the same!”

564
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,000
and thus wakened himself, staring.

565
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,160
“What’s the matter?” he demanded.

566
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,800
He was slow in getting back to where we were; and full consciousness
found him sitting up with his eyes fixed on mine.

567
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,560
They were more haunted than they had been at all, and his next
speech came straight from his dream.

568
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,840
“Maybe you’d better quit me. This ain’t your trouble.”

569
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,440
I laughed.

570
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,840
“Why, what is the trouble?”

571
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,320
His eyes still intently fixed on mine.

572
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:55,560
“Do you think if we changed our trail we could lose them from
us?”

573
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:10,200
I was framing a jocose reply about Ounces being a good walker, when the sound of
hoofs rushing in the distance stopped me, and he ran out of the tent with his rifle.

574
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,920
When I followed with mine he was up the bank, and all his powers
alert.

575
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,400
But nothing came out of the dimness save our three stampeded
horses.

576
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:28,360
They crashed over fallen timber and across the open to where
their picketed comrade grazed at the end of his rope.

577
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:41,680
By him they came to a stand, and told him, I suppose, what they had seen; for
all four now faced in the same direction, looking away into the mysterious dawn.

578
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,720
We likewise stood peering, and my rifle barrel felt cold in my
hand.

579
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:57,880
The dawn was all we saw, the inscrutable dawn, coming and coming
through the black pines and the gray open of the basin.

580
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:06,160
There above lifted the peaks, no sun yet on them, and behind
us our stream made a little tinkling.

581
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
“A bear, I suppose,” said I, at length.

582
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,640
His strange look fixed me again, and then his eyes went to the
horses.

583
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,760
“They smell things we can’t smell,” said he, very slowly.

584
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,520
“Will you prove to me they don’t see things we can’t see?”

585
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,600
A chill shot through me, and I could not help a frightened glance
where we had been watching.

586
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,040
But one of the horses began to graze and I had a wholesome thought.


587
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,960
“He’s tired of whatever he sees, then,” said I, pointing.

588
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,200
A smile came for a moment in the Virginian’s face.

589
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,680
“Must be a poor show,” he observed.

590
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:52,480
All the horses were grazing now, and he added, “It ain’t hurt
their appetites any.”

591
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,640
We made our own breakfast then.

592
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:01,560
And what uncanny dread I may have been touched with up to this
time henceforth left me in the face of a real alarm.

593
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,280
The shock of Steve was working upon the Virginian.

594
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:14,000
He was aware of it himself; he was fighting it with all his might;
and he was being overcome.

595
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,240
He was indeed like a gallant swimmer against whom both wind and
tide have conspired.

596
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,880
And in this now foreboding solitude there was only myself to
throw him ropes.

597
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,960
His strokes for safety were as bold as was the undertow that
ceaselessly annulled them.

598
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,800
“I reckon I made a fuss in the tent?” said he, feeling his way
with me.

599
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,400
I threw him a rope.

600
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,680
“Yes. Nightmare⁠—indigestion⁠—too much newspaper before retiring.”


601
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,240
He caught the rope.

602
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:51,200
“That’s correct! I had a hell of a foolish dream for a growed-up
man. You’d not think it of me.”

603
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:57,920
“Oh, yes, I should. I’ve had them after prolonged lobster and
champagne.”

604
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,680
“Ah,” he murmured, “prolonged!

605
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,640
Prolonged is what does it.”

606
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,080
He glanced behind him.

607
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,800
“Steve came back⁠—”

608
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,520
“In your lobster dream,” I put in.

609
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,160
But he missed this rope.

610
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,360
“Yes,” he answered, with his eyes searching me.

611
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,840
“And he handed me the paper⁠—”

612
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,240
“By the way, where is that?” I asked.

613
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,680
“I built the fire with it.

614
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:30,160
But when I took it from him it was a six-shooter I had hold of,
and pointing at my breast.

615
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,880
And then Steve spoke.

616
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:43,560
‘Do you think you’re fit to live?’ Steve said; and I got hot at
him, and I reckon I must have told him what I thought of him.

617
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,320
You heard me, I expect?”

618
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,840
“Glad I didn’t. Your language sometimes is⁠—”

619
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,160
He laughed out.

620
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,640
“Oh, I account for all this that’s happening just like you do.


621
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,000
If we gave our explanations, they’d be pretty near twins.”

622
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,320
“The horses saw a bear, then?”

623
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:08,000
“Maybe a bear. Maybe” ⁠—but here the tide caught him again⁠—“What’s
your idea about dreams?”

624
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,840
My ropes were all out.

625
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,760
“Liver⁠—nerves,” was the best I could do.

626
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,360
But now he swam strongly by himself.

627
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,600
“You may think I’m discreditable,” he said, “but I know I am.


628
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,680
It ought to take more than⁠—well, men have lost their friendships
before.

629
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,960
Feuds and wars have cloven a right smart of bonds in twain.

630
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,160
And if my haid is going to get shook by a little old piece of
newspaper⁠—I’m ashamed I burned that.

631
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,720
I

632
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,560
’m ashamed to have been that weak.”

633
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,720
“Any man gets unstrung,” I told him.

634
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,240
My ropes had become straws; and I strove to frame some policy
for the next hours.

635
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,640
We now finished breakfast and set forth to catch the horses.

636
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:57,120
As we drove them in I found that the Virginian was telling me
a ghost story.

637
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:08,560
“At half-past three in the morning she saw her runaway daughter
standing with a babe in her arms; but when she moved it was all gone.

638
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:16,240
Later they found it was the very same hour the young mother died
in Nogales.

639
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,280
And she sent for the child and raised it herself.

640
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,360
I knowed them both back home.

641
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,880
Do you believe that?”

642
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,840
I said nothing.

643
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,880
“No more do I believe it,” he asserted.

644
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,560
“And see here! Nogales time is three hours different from Richmond.
I didn’t know about that point then.”

645
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:42,280
Once out of these mountains, I knew he could right himself; but even I, who
had no Steve to dream about, felt this silence of the peaks was preying on me.

646
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,320
“Her daughter and her might have been thinkin’ mighty hard about
each other just then,” he pursued.

647
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:53,880
“But Steve is dead. Finished. You cert’nly don’t believe there’s
anything more?”

648
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,360
“I wish I could,” I told him.

649
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:11,680
“No, I’m satisfied. Heaven didn’t never interest me much. But if there was a world of
dreams after you went⁠—” He stopped himself and turned his searching eyes away from mine.

650
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:20,600
“There’s a heap o’ darkness wherever you try to step,” he said,
“and I thought I’d left off wasting thoughts on the subject.

651
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:38,960
You see”⁠—he dexterously roped a horse, and once more his splendid sanity was turned to gold by his imagination⁠—“I expect in many
growed-up men you’d call sensible there’s a little boy sleepin’⁠—the little kid they onced was⁠—that still keeps his fear of the dark.

652
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,760
You mentioned the dark yourself yesterday.

653
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:53,520
Well, this experience has woke up that kid in me, and blamed
if I can coax the little cuss to go to sleep again!

654
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,280
I keep a-telling him daylight will sure come, but he keeps a-crying
and holding on to me.”

655
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,720
Somewhere far in the basin there was a faint sound, and we stood
still.

656
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
“Hush!” he said.

657
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,520
But it was like our watching the dawn; nothing more followed.


658
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,360
“They have shot that bear,” I remarked.

659
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:18,080
He did not answer, and we put the saddles on without talk.

660
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:24,480
We made no haste, but we were not over half an hour, I suppose,
in getting off with the packs.

661
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:34,320
It was not a new thing to hear a shot where wild game was in plenty; yet
as we rode that shot sounded already in my mind different from others.

662
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,520
Perhaps I should not believe this today but for what I look back
to.

663
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:46,680
To make camp last night we had turned off the trail, and now followed
the stream down for a while, taking next a cut through the wood.

664
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:55,120
In this way we came upon the tracks of our horses where they
had been galloping back to the camp after their fright.

665
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:01,640
They had kicked up the damp and matted pine needles very plainly
all along.

666
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,840
“Nothing has been here but themselves, though,” said I.

667
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:12,200
“And they ain’t showing signs of remembering any scare,” said
the Virginian.

668
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,600
In a little while we emerged upon an open.

669
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:23,520
“Here’s where they was grazing,” said the Virginian; and the
signs were clear enough.

670
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,200
“Here’s where they must have got their scare,” he pursued.

671
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,960
“You stay with them while I circle a little.”

672
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,960
So I stayed; and certainly our animals were very calm at visiting
this scene.

673
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:44,320
When you bring a horse back to where he has recently encountered
a wild animal his ears and his nostrils are apt to be wide awake.

674
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,800
The Virginian had stopped and was beckoning to me.

675
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,560
“Here’s your bear,” said he, as I arrived.

676
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,520
“Two-legged, you see. And he had a hawss of his own.”

677
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,680
There was a stake driven down where an animal had been picketed
for the night.

678
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,840
“Looks like Ounces,” I said, considering the footprints.

679
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:12,600
“It’s Ounces. And Ounces wanted another hawss very bad, so him
and Pounds could travel like gentlemen should.”

680
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,600
“But Pounds doesn’t seem to have been with him.”

681
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,800
“Oh, Pounds, he was making coffee, somewheres in yonder, when
this happened.

682
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:28,560
Neither of them guessed there’d be other hawsses wandering here
in the night, or they both would have come.”

683
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,200
He turned back to our pack animals.

684
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,680
“Then you’ll not hunt for this camp to make sure?”

685
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,040
“I prefer making sure first. We might be expected at that camp.”


686
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:46,240
He took out his rifle from beneath his leg and set it across
his saddle at half-cock.

687
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:53,120
I did the same; and thus cautiously we resumed our journey in
a slightly different direction.

688
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,840
“This ain’t all we’re going to find out,” said the Virginian.


689
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:02,520
“Ounces had a good idea; but I reckon he made a bad mistake later.”


690
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,160
We had found out a good deal without any more, I thought.

691
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:19,240
Ounces had gone to bring in their single horse, and coming upon three more in the pasture
had undertaken to catch one and failed, merely driving them where he feared to follow.

692
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,440
“Shorty never could rope a horse alone,” I remarked.

693
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,200
The Virginian grinned.

694
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:37,000
“Shorty? Well, Shorty sounds as well as Ounces. But that ain’t
the mistake I’m thinking he made.”

695
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,680
I knew that he would not tell me, but that was just like him.


696
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:55,840
For the last twenty minutes, having something to do, he had become himself again, had
come to earth from that unsafe country of the brain where beckoned a spectral Steve.

697
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:14,000
Nothing was left but in his eyes that question which pain had set there; and I wondered if his friend of old, who seemed
so brave and amiable, would have dealt him that hurt at the solemn end had he known what a poisoned wound it would be.

698
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,600
We came out on a ridge from which we could look down.

699
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:24,280
“You always want to ride on high places when there’s folks around
whose intentions ain’t been declared,” said the Virginian.

700
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,520
And we went along our ridge for some distance.

701
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:35,640
Then, suddenly he turned down and guided us almost at once to
the trail.

702
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,160
“That’s it,” he said.

703
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,280
“See.”

704
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,400
The track of a horse was very fresh on the trail.

705
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,160
But it was a galloping horse now, and no bootprints were keeping
up with it any more.

706
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,480
No boots could have kept up with it.

707
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,720
The rider was making time today.

708
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,560
Yesterday that horse had been ridden up into the mountains at
leisure.

709
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,040
Who was on him?

710
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,640
There was never to be any certain answer to that.

711
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,600
But who was not on him?

712
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:16,840
We turned back in our journey, back into the heart of that basin with the tall
peaks all rising like teeth in the cloudless sun, and the snowfields shining white.

713
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,560
“He was afraid of us,” said the Virginian.

714
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:26,720
“He did not know how many of us had come up here. Three hawsses
might mean a dozen more around.”

715
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,920
We followed the backward trail in among the pines, and came after
a time upon their camp.

716
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,600
And then I understood the mistake that Shorty had made.

717
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:41,400
He had returned after his failure, and had told that other man
of the presence of new horses.

718
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:49,360
He should have kept this a secret; for haste had to be made at
once, and two cannot get away quickly upon one horse.

719
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,000
But it was poor Shorty’s last blunder.

720
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:59,640
He lay there by their extinct fire, with his wistful, lost-dog face
upward, and his thick yellow hair unparted as it had always been.

721
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,640
The murder had been done from behind.

722
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,280
We closed the eyes.

723
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,680
“There was no natural harm in him,” said the Virginian.

724
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,160
“But you must do a thing well in this country.”

725
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:20,880
There was not a trace, not a clue, of the other man; and we found
a place where we could soon cover Shorty with earth.

726
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,760
As we lifted him we saw the newspaper that he had been reading.


727
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:39,160
He had brought it from the clump of cottonwoods where he and the other man had made a later
visit than ours to be sure of the fate of their friends⁠—or possibly in hopes of another horse.

728
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:45,120
Evidently, when the party were surprised, they had been able
to escape with only one.

729
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:54,600
All of the newspaper was there save the leaf I had picked up⁠—all and more, for
this had pencil writing on it that was not mine, nor did I at first take it in.

730
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,880
I thought it might be a clue, and I read it aloud.

731
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,520
“Goodbye, Jeff,” it said.

732
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,000
“I could not have spoke to you without playing the baby.”

733
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,320
“Who’s Jeff?” I asked.

734
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,760
But it came over me when I looked at the Virginian.

735
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:21,640
He was standing beside me quite motionless; and then he put out
his hand and took the paper, and stood still, looking at the words.

736
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:27,480
“Steve used to call me Jeff,” he said, “because I was Southern.


737
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,800
I reckon nobody else ever did.”

738
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:41,080
He slowly folded the message from the dead, brought by the dead,
and rolled it in the coat behind his saddle.

739
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:47,080
For a half-minute he stood leaning his forehead down against
the saddle.

740
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:52,880
After this he came back and contemplated Shorty’s face awhile.


741
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,240
“I wish I could thank him,” he said.

742
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,200
“I wish I could.”

743
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:08,560
We carried Shorty over and covered him with earth, and on that laid a few pine branches; then we took up our
journey, and by the end of the forenoon we had gone some distance upon our trail through the Teton Mountains.

744
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:25,960
But in front of us the hoofprints ever held their stride of haste, drawing farther from us through the hours, until by the
next afternoon somewhere we noticed they were no longer to be seen; and after that they never came upon the trail again.

745
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,680
CHAPTER XXXIII

746
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,800
The Spinster Loses Some Sleep

747
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:37,720
Somewhere at the eastern base of the Tetons did those hoofprints
disappear into a mountain sanctuary where many crooked paths have led.

748
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:46,280
He that took another man’s possessions, or he that took another man’s life,
could always run here if the law or popular justice were too hot at his heels.

749
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:56,520
Steep ranges and forests walled him in from the world on all four sides,
almost without a break; and every entrance lay through intricate solitudes.

750
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:07,600
Snake River came into the place through canyons and mournful pines and
marshes, to the north, and went out at the south between formidable chasms.

751
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:31,120
Every tributary to this stream rose among high peaks and ridges, and descended into the valley by well-nigh impenetrable courses: Pacific Creek from Two Ocean Pass, Buffalo Fork
from no pass at all, Black Rock from the To-wo-ge-tee Pass⁠—all these, and many more, were the waters of loneliness, among whose thousand hiding-places it was easy to be lost.

752
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:44,200
Down in the bottom was a spread of level land, broad and beautiful, with the blue and silver Tetons
rising from its chain of lakes to the west, and other heights presiding over its other sides.

753
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:59,680
And up and down and in and out of this hollow square of mountains, where waters plentifully
flowed, and game and natural pasture abounded, there skulked a nomadic and distrustful population.

754
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:08,720
This in due time built cabins, took wives, begot children, and came
to speak of itself as “The honest settlers of Jackson’s Hole.”

755
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,120
It is a commodious title, and doubtless today more accurate than
it was once.

756
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,280
Into this place the hoofprints disappeared.

757
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:26,320
Not many cabins were yet built there; but the unknown rider of the horse knew
well that he would find shelter and welcome among the felons of his stripe.

758
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:48,640
Law and order might guess his name correctly, but there was no next step, for lack of evidence; and he would wait,
whoever he was, until the rage of popular justice, which had been pursuing him and his brother thieves, should subside.

759
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:56,560
Then, feeling his way gradually with prudence, he would let himself
be seen again.

760
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:06,800
And now, as mysteriously as he had melted away, rumor passed
over the country.

761
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:15,360
No tongue seemed to be heard telling the first news; the news
was there, one day, a matter of whispered knowledge.

762
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:26,800
On Sunk Creek and on Bear Creek, and elsewhere far and wide, before men talked men
seemed secretly to know that Steve, and Ed, and Shorty, would never again be seen.

763
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:33,080
Riders met each other in the road and drew rein to discuss the
event, and its bearing upon the cattle interests.

764
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:39,360
In town saloons men took each other aside, and muttered over
it in corners.

765
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:45,000
Thus it reached the ears of Molly Wood, beginning in a veiled
and harmless shape.

766
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,200
A neighbor joined her when she was out riding by herself.

767
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,680
“Good morning,” said he.

768
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,720
“Don’t you find it lonesome?”

769
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:59,360
And when she answered lightly, he continued, meaning well: “You’ll
be having company again soon now.

770
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,920
He has finished his job.

771
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,880
Wish he’d finished it more!

772
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,160
Well, good day.”

773
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,280
Molly thought these words over.

774
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,480
She could not tell why they gave her a strange feeling.

775
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,840
To her Vermont mind no suspicion of the truth would come naturally.


776
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,000
But suspicion began to come when she returned from her ride.

777
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,480
For, entering the cabin of the Taylors’, she came upon several people
who all dropped their talk short, and were not skilful at resuming it.

778
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:31,080
She sat there awhile, uneasily aware that all of them knew
something which she did not know, and was not intended to know.

779
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,560
A thought pierced her⁠—had anything happened to her lover?

780
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,240
No; that was not it.

781
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,960
The man she had met on horseback spoke of her having company
soon again.

782
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,760
How soon?

783
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,440
she wondered.

784
01:09:41,440 --> 01:10:01,560
He had been unable to say when he should return, and now she suddenly felt that a great silence had enveloped him lately: not the mere silence
of absence, of receiving no messages or letters, but another sort of silence which now, at this moment, was weighing strangely upon her.

785
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,880
And then the next day it came out at the schoolhouse.

786
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,520
During that interval known as recess, she became aware through
the open window that they were playing a new game outside.

787
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,640
Lusty screeches of delight reached her ears.

788
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,120
“Jump!” a voice ordered.

789
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,280
“Jump!”

790
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,840
“I don’t want to,” returned another voice, uneasily.

791
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,120
“You said you would,” said several.

792
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:28,560
“Didn’t he say he would? Ah, he said he would. Jump now, quick!”


793
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:34,720
“But I don’t want to,” quavered the voice in a tone so dismal
that Molly went out to see.

794
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:43,840
They had got Bob Carmody on the top of the gate by a tree, with a rope round
his neck, the other end of which four little boys were joyously holding.

795
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,840
The rest looked on eagerly, three little girls clasping their
hands, and springing up and down with excitement.

796
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,040
“Why, children!” exclaimed Molly.

797
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,960
“He’s said his prayers and everything,” they all screamed out.


798
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,040
“He’s a rustler, and we’re lynchin’ him. Jump, Bob!”

799
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,080
“I don’t want⁠—”

800
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,680
“Ah, coward, won’t take his medicine!”

801
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,360
“Let him go, boys,” said Molly.

802
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,760
“You might really hurt him.”

803
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
And so she broke up this game, but not without general protest
from Wyoming’s young voice.

804
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,520
“He said he would,” Henry Dow assured her.

805
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:18,520
And George Taylor further explained: “He said he’d be Steve.

806
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,240
But Steve didn’t scare.”

807
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:28,200
Then George proceeded to tell the schoolmarm, eagerly, all about
Steve and Ed, while the schoolmarm looked at him with a rigid face.

808
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:34,200
“You promised your mother you’d not tell,” said Henry Dow, after
all had been told.

809
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:38,520
“You’ve gone and done it,” and Henry wagged his head in a superior
manner.

810
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,880
Thus did the New England girl learn what her cowboy lover had
done.

811
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,960
She spoke of it to nobody; she kept her misery to herself.

812
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,600
He was not there to defend his act.

813
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,960
Perhaps in a way that was better.

814
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,880
But these were hours of darkness indeed to Molly Wood.

815
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:13,240
On that visit to Dunbarton, when at the first sight of her lover’s photograph in frontier dress her aunt had exclaimed, “I
suppose there are days when he does not kill people,” she had cried in all good faith and mirth, “He never killed anybody!”

816
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:24,080
Later, when he was lying in her cabin weak from his bullet wound, but each day stronger
beneath her nursing, at a certain word of his there had gone through her a shudder of doubt.

817
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:33,760
Perhaps in his many wanderings he had done such a thing in self-defence,
or in the cause of popular justice.

818
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:40,480
But she had pushed the idea away from her hastily, back into
the days before she had ever seen him.

819
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,160
If this had ever happened, let her not know of it.

820
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:51,400
Then, as a cruel reward for his candor and his laying himself bare to her mother,
the letters from Bennington had used that very letter of his as a weapon against him.

821
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,720
Her sister Sarah had quoted from it.

822
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,480
“He says with apparent pride,” wrote Sarah, “that he has never
killed for pleasure or profit.’

823
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,680
Those are his exact words, and you may guess their dreadful effect
upon mother.

824
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:09,560
I congratulate you, my dear, on having chosen a protector so
scrupulous.”

825
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:17,200
Thus her elder sister had seen fit to write; and letters from
less near relatives made hints at the same subject.

826
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,680
So she was compelled to accept this piece of knowledge thrust
upon her.

827
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,280
Yet still, still, those events had been before she knew him.

828
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,760
They were remote, without detail or context.

829
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,080
He had been little more than a boy.

830
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,880
No doubt it was to save his own life.

831
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:42,440
And so she bore the hurt of her discovery all the more easily
because her sister’s tone roused her to defend her cowboy.

832
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,360
But now!

833
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:53,400
In her cabin, alone, after midnight, she arose from her sleepless
bed, and lighting the candle, stood before his photograph.

834
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:59,000
“It is a good face,” her great-aunt had said, after some study
of it.

835
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,160
And these words were in her mind now.

836
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:18,000
There his likeness stood at full length, confronting her: the spurs on the boots, the fringed leathern chaparreros, the coiled rope
in hand, the pistol at hip, the rough flannel shirt, and the scarf knotted at the throat⁠—and then the grave eyes, looking at her.

837
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,680
It thrilled her to meet them, even so.

838
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,400
She could read life into them.

839
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,160
She seemed to feel passion come from them, and then something
like reproach.

840
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:39,320
She stood for a long while looking at him, and then, beating her hands together
suddenly, she blew out her light and went back into bed, but not to sleep.

841
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,960
“You’re looking pale, deary,” said Mrs. Taylor to her, a few
days later.

842
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,280
“Am I?”

843
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,880
“And you don’t eat anything.”

844
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,560
“Oh, yes, I do.”

845
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,640
And Molly retired to her cabin.

846
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,040
“George,” said Mrs. Taylor, “you come here.”

847
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:58,400
It may seem severe⁠—I think that it was severe.

848
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,920
That evening when Mr. Taylor came home to his family, George
received a thrashing for disobedience.

849
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:11,600
“And I suppose,” said Mrs. Taylor to her husband, “that she came
out just in time to stop ’em breaking Bob Carmody’s neck for him.”

850
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:17,200
Upon the day following Mrs. Taylor essayed the impossible.

851
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,680
She took herself over to Molly Wood’s cabin.

852
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,800
The girl gave her a listless greeting, and the dame sat slowly
down, and surveyed the comfortable room.

853
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,240
“A very nice home, deary,” said she, “if it was a home.

854
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:32,720
But you’ll fix something like this in your real home, I have
no doubt.”

855
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,000
Molly made no answer.

856
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,800
“What we’re going to do without you I can’t see,” said Mrs. Taylor.


857
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,520
“But I’d not have it different for worlds. He’ll be coming back
soon, I expect.”

858
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,520
“Mrs. Taylor,” said Molly, all at once, “please don’t say anything
now.

859
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,560
I can’t stand it.”

860
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,080
And she broke into wretched tears.

861
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,760
“Why, deary, he⁠—”

862
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,360
“No; not a word. Please, please⁠—I’ll go out if you do.”

863
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,640
The older woman went to the younger one, and then put her arms
round her.

864
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:16,280
But when the tears were over, they had not done any good; it was
not the storm that clears the sky⁠—all storms do not clear the sky.

865
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:23,920
And Mrs. Taylor looked at the pale girl and saw that she could
do nothing to help her toward peace of mind.

866
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:32,160
“Of course,” she said to her husband, after returning from her
profitless errand, “you might know she’d feel dreadful.

867
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,640
“What about?” said Taylor.

868
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:46,520
“Why, you know just as well as I do. And I’ll say for myself,
I hope you’ll never have to help hang folks.”

869
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,560
“Well,” said Taylor, mildly, “if I had to, I’d have to, I guess.”


870
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,880
“Well, I don’t want it to come. But that poor girl is eating
her heart right out over it.”

871
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,280
“What does she say?”

872
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:07,560
“It’s what she don’t say. She’ll not talk, and she’ll not let
me talk, and she sits and sits.”

873
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,600
“I’ll go talk some to her,” said the man.

874
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,680
“Well, Taylor, I thought you had more sense.

875
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,840
You’d not get a word in.

876
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:21,120
She’ll be sick soon if her worry ain’t stopped someway, though.”


877
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,240
“What does she want this country to do?” inquired Taylor.

878
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,960
“Does she expect it to be like Vermont when it⁠—”

879
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:33,640
“We can’t help what she expects,” his wife interrupted.

880
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,400
“But I wish we could help her.”

881
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,720
They could not, however; and help came from another source.

882
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,800
Judge Henry rode by the next day.

883
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,640
To him good Mrs. Taylor at once confided her anxiety.

884
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,520
The Judge looked grave.

885
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,720
“Must I meddle?” he said.

886
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,520
“Yes, Judge, you must,” said Mrs. Taylor.

887
01:17:53,520 --> 01:18:02,600
“But why can’t I send him over here when he gets back? Then they’ll
just settle it between themselves.”

888
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,400
Mrs. Taylor shook her head.

889
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,280
“That would unsettle it worse than it is,” she assured him.

890
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,720
“They mustn’t meet just now.”

891
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,440
The Judge sighed.

892
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,800
“Well,” he said, “very well.

893
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,080
I’ll sacrifice my character, since you insist.”

894
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:28,880
Judge Henry sat thinking, waiting until school should be out.


895
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,960
He did not at all relish what lay before him.

896
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,120
He would like to have got out of it.

897
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:52,320
He had been a federal judge; he had been an upright judge; he had met the responsibilities of his difficult office
not only with learning, which is desirable, but also with courage and common sense besides, and these are essential.

898
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,560
He had been a stanch servant of the law.

899
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:08,080
And now he was invited to defend that which, at first sight, nay, even at second and
third sight, must always seem a defiance of the law more injurious than crime itself.

900
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,520
Every good man in this world has convictions about right and
wrong.

901
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:19,440
They are his soul’s riches, his spiritual gold.

902
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:28,240
When his conduct is at variance with these, he knows that it is
a departure, a falling; and this is a simple and clear matter.

903
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:35,760
If falling were all that ever happened to a good man, all his
days would be a simple matter of striving and repentance.

904
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,160
But it is not all.

905
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:51,320
There come to him certain junctures, crises, when life, like a highwayman, springs upon him, demanding that he
stand and deliver his convictions in the name of some righteous cause, bidding him do evil that good may come.

906
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,160
I cannot say that I believe in doing evil that good may come.


907
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:53,640
I do not.

908
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,600
I think that any man who honestly justifies such course deceives
himself.

909
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:06,320
But this I can say: to call any act evil, instantly begs the
question.

910
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:22,080
Many an act that man does is right or wrong according to the time and place which form, so to
speak, its context; strip it of its surrounding circumstances, and you tear away its meaning.

911
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,200
Gentlemen reformers, beware of this common practice of yours!


912
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,360
beware of calling an act evil on Tuesday because that same act
was evil on Monday!

913
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,160
Do you fail to follow my meaning?

914
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,880
Then here is an illustration.

915
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:44,240
On Monday I walk over my neighbor’s field; there is no wrong
in such walking.

916
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:50,840
By Tuesday he has put up a sign that trespassers will be prosecuted
according to law.

917
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,520
I walk again on Tuesday, and am a lawbreaker.

918
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,280
Do you begin to see my point?

919
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:02,480
or are you inclined to object to the illustration because the
walking on Tuesday was not wrong, but merely illegal?

920
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:08,320
Then here is another illustration which you will find it a trifle
more embarrassing to answer.

921
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:23,440
Consider carefully, let me beg you, the case of a young man and a young woman who walk
out of a door on Tuesday, pronounced man and wife by a third party inside the door.

922
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:30,320
It matters not that on Monday they were, in their own hearts,
sacredly vowed to each other.

923
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:48,200
If they had omitted stepping inside that door, if they had dispensed with that third party, and gone away on
Monday sacredly vowed to each other in their own hearts, you would have scarcely found their conduct moral.

924
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,720
Consider these things carefully⁠—the signpost and the third party⁠—and
the difference they make.

925
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,040
And now, for a finish, we will return to the signpost.

926
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:06,640
Suppose that I went over my neighbor’s field on Tuesday, after the signpost was put up,
because I saw a murder about to be committed in the field, and therefore ran in and stopped it.

927
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,720
Was I doing evil that good might come?

928
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:17,520
Do you not think that to stay out and let the murder be done
would have been the evil act in this case?

929
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:33,080
To disobey the signpost was right; and I trust that you now perceive the same act may wear as many
different hues of right or wrong as the rainbow, according to the atmosphere in which it is done.

930
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:40,280
It is not safe to say of any man, “He did evil that good might
come.”

931
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:45,520
Was the thing that he did, in the first place, evil?

932
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,360
That is the question.

933
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,640
Forgive my asking you to use your mind.

934
01:22:51,640 --> 01:23:00,440
It is a thing which no novelist should expect of his reader, and we
will go back at once to Judge Henry and his meditations about lynching.

935
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:19,680
He was well aware that if he was to touch at all upon this subject with the New England girl, he could
not put her off with mere platitudes and humdrum formulas; not, at least, if he expected to do any good.

936
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:26,440
She was far too intelligent, and he was really anxious to do
good.

937
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:38,280
For her sake he wanted the course of the girl’s true love to run more
smoothly, and still more did he desire this for the sake of his Virginian.

938
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:46,120
“I sent him myself on that business,” the Judge reflected uncomfortably.


939
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,080
“I am partly responsible for the lynching.

940
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,920
It has brought him one great unhappiness already through the
death of Steve.

941
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:56,440
If it gets running in this girl’s mind, she may⁠—dear me!”

942
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,400
the Judge broke off, “what a nuisance!”

943
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,120
And he sighed.

944
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:12,960
For as all men know, he also knew that many things should be done
in this world in silence, and that talking about them is a mistake.

945
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:32,080
But when school was out, and the girl gone to her cabin, his mind had set the subject in order thoroughly,
and he knocked at her door, ready, as he had put it, to sacrifice his character in the cause of true love.

946
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,840
“Well,” he said, coming straight to the point, “some dark things
have happened.”

947
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:43,680
And when she made no answer to this, he continued: “But you must
not misunderstand us.

948
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,760
We’re too fond of you for that.”

949
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:56,760
“Judge Henry,” said Molly Wood, also coming straight to the point,
“have you come to tell me that you think well of lynching?”

950
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,520
He met her.

951
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,520
“Of burning Southern negroes in public, no.

952
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,840
Of hanging Wyoming cattle thieves in private, yes.

953
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,880
You perceive there’s a difference, don’t you?”

954
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:13,200
“Not in principle,” said the girl, dry and short.

955
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,560
“Oh⁠—dear⁠—me!” slowly exclaimed the Judge.

956
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,040
“I am sorry that you cannot see that, because I think that I
can.

957
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,800
And I think that you have just as much sense as I have.”

958
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:30,600
The Judge made himself very grave and very good-humored at the
same time.

959
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,280
The poor girl was strung to a high pitch, and spoke harshly in
spite of herself.

960
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,160
“What is the difference in principle?” she demanded.

961
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:45,160
“Well,” said the Judge, easy and thoughtful

962
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,840
, “what do you mean by principle?”

963
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,600
“I didn’t think you’d quibble,” flashed Molly.

964
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,680
“I’m not a lawyer myself.”

965
01:25:52,680 --> 01:26:03,520
A man less wise than Judge Henry would have smiled at this, and then war would have
exploded hopelessly between them, and harm been added to what was going wrong already.

966
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:12,120
But the Judge knew that he must give to every word that the girl
said now his perfect consideration.

967
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:16,200
“I don’t mean to quibble,” he assured her.

968
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:21,560
“I know the trick of escaping from one question by asking another.


969
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,880
But I don’t want to escape from anything you hold me to answer.


970
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:33,880
If you can show me that I am wrong, I want you to do so.

971
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:38,600
But,” and here the Judge smiled, “I want you to play fair, too.”


972
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,440
“And how am I not?”

973
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:44,480
“I want you to be just as willing to be put right by me as I
am to be put right by you.

974
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:51,520
And so when you use such a word as principle, you must help me
to answer by saying what principle you mean.

975
01:26:51,520 --> 01:27:02,280
For in all sincerity I see no likeness in principle whatever between burning
Southern negroes in public and hanging Wyoming horse-thieves in private.

976
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:12,200
I consider the burning a proof that the South is semi-barbarous, and
the hanging a proof that Wyoming is determined to become civilized.

977
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,360
We do not torture our criminals when we lynch them.

978
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,640
We do not invite spectators to enjoy their death agony.

979
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,480
We put no such hideous disgrace upon the United States.

980
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:28,360
We execute our criminals by the swiftest means, and in the quietest
way.

981
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:32,440
Do you think the principle is the same?”

982
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,440
Molly had listened to him with attention.

983
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,800
“The way is different,” she admitted.

984
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,000
“Only the way?”

985
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,880
“So it seems to me. Both defy law and order.”

986
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,560
“Ah, but do they both? Now we’re getting near the principle.”


987
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,960
“Why, yes. Ordinary citizens take the law in their own hands.”


988
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,960
“The principle at last!” exclaimed the Judge.

989
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:58,520
“Now tell me some more things. Out of whose hands do they take
the law?”

990
01:27:58,520 --> 01:27:59,040
“The court’s.”

991
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,480
“What made the courts?”

992
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,800
“I don’t understand.”

993
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,920
“How did there come to be any courts?”

994
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,560
“The Constitution.”

995
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:13,400
“How did there come to be any Constitution? Who made it?”

996
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,520
“The delegates, I suppose.”

997
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,280
“Who made the delegates?”

998
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,240
“I suppose they were elected, or appointed, or something.”

999
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,360
“And who elected them?”

1000
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,680
“Of course the people elected them.”

1001
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,560
“Call them the ordinary citizens,” said the Judge.

1002
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,760
“I like your term.

1003
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,120
They are where the law comes from, you see.

1004
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,240
For they chose the delegates who made the Constitution that provided
for the courts.

1005
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,520
There’s your machinery.

1006
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:45,480
These are the hands into which ordinary citizens have put the
law.

1007
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,680
So you see, at best, when they lynch they only take back what
they once gave.

1008
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:55,280
Now we’ll take your two cases that you say are the same in principle.


1009
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,760
I think that they are not.

1010
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:03,520
For in the South they take a negro from jail where he was waiting
to be duly hung.

1011
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:09,360
The South has never claimed that the law would let him go.

1012
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,000
But in Wyoming the law has been letting our cattle-thieves go
for two years.

1013
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:20,040
We are in a very bad way, and we are trying to make that way
a little better until civilization can reach us.

1014
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,000
At present we lie beyond its pale.

1015
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,000
The courts, or rather the juries, into whose hands we have put
the law, are not dealing the law.

1016
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,040
They are withered hands, or rather they are imitation hands made
for show, with no life in them, no grip.

1017
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,080
They cannot hold a cattle-thief.

1018
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:56,440
And so when your ordinary citizen sees this, and sees that he has placed justice in a dead hand,
he must take justice back into his own hands where it was once at the beginning of all things.

1019
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,760
Call this primitive, if you will.

1020
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:12,440
But so far from being a defiance of the law, it is an assertion of it⁠—the fundamental
assertion of self governing men, upon whom our whole social fabric is based.

1021
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:21,680
There is your principle, Miss Wood, as I see it.

1022
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,280
Now can you help me to see anything different?”

1023
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:24,600
She could not.

1024
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,200
“But perhaps you are of the same opinion still?” the Judge inquired.


1025
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,720
“It is all terrible to me,” she said.

1026
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,480
“Yes; and so is capital punishment terrible.

1027
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,240
And so is war.

1028
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,840
And perhaps some day we shall do without them.

1029
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:46,240
But they are none of them so terrible as unchecked theft and
murder would be.”

1030
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:54,920
After the Judge had departed on his way to Sunk Creek, no one
spoke to Molly upon this subject.

1031
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,840
But her face did not grow cheerful at once.

1032
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,320
It was plain from her fits of silence that her thoughts were
not at rest.

1033
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:12,600
And sometimes at night she would stand in front of her lover’s
likeness, gazing upon it with both love and shrinking.

1034
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,960
CHAPTER XXXIV

1035
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,120
To Fit Her Finger

1036
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:19,040
It was two rings that the Virginian wrote for when next I heard
from him.

1037
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:26,240
After my dark sight of what the Cattle Land could be, I soon
had journeyed home by way of Washakie and Rawlins.

1038
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:31,160
Steve and Shorty did not leave my memory, nor will they ever,
I suppose.

1039
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:35,600
The Virginian had touched the whole thing the day I left him.


1040
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,680
He had noticed me looking a sort of farewell at the plains and
mountains.

1041
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,800
“You will come back to it,” he said.

1042
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:54,600
“If there was a headstone for every man that once pleasured in his
freedom here, yu’d see one most every time yu’ turned your head.

1043
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,720
It’s a heap sadder than a graveyard⁠—but yu’ love it all the
same.”

1044
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:05,760
Sadness had passed from him⁠—from his uppermost mood, at least,
when he wrote about the rings.

1045
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,320
Deep in him was sadness of course, as well as joy.

1046
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,000
For he had known Steve, and he had covered Shorty with earth.


1047
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:24,200
He had looked upon life with a marksman’s eyes, very close; and no one, if he have
a heart, can pass through this and not carry sadness in his spirit with him forever.

1048
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:32,040
But he seldom shows it openly; it bides within him, enriching his
cheerfulness and rendering him of better service to his fellow-men.

1049
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:37,120
It was a commission of cheerfulness that he now gave, being distant
from where rings are to be bought.

1050
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,160
He could not go so far as the East to procure what he had planned.


1051
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:50,600
Rings were to be had in Cheyenne, and a still greater choice in Denver; and so
far as either of these towns his affairs would have permitted him to travel.

1052
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,800
But he was set upon having rings from the East.

1053
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:02,600
They must come from the best place in the country; nothing
short of that was good enough “to fit her finger,” as he said.

1054
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,800
The wedding ring was a simple matter.

1055
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:15,680
Let it be right, that was all: the purest gold that could be used, with her initials
and his together graven round the inside, with the day of the month and the year.

1056
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,520
The date was now set.

1057
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,360
It had come so far as this.

1058
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,600
July third was to be the day.

1059
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:34,680
Then for sixty days and nights he was to be a bridegroom, free from his duties
at Sunk Creek, free to take his bride wheresoever she might choose to go.

1060
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,720
And she had chosen.

1061
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:43,360
Those voices of the world had more than angered her; for after
the anger a set purpose was left.

1062
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:48,920
Her sister should have the chance neither to come nor to stay
away.

1063
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:53,960
Had her mother even answered the Virginian’s letter, there could
have been some relenting.

1064
01:33:53,960 --> 01:34:03,360
But the poor lady had been inadequate in this, as in all other searching moments
of her life: she had sent messages⁠—kind ones, to be sure⁠—but only messages.

1065
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:10,320
If this had hurt the Virginian, no one knew it in the world, least
of all the girl in whose heart it had left a cold, frozen spot.

1066
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,800
Not a good spirit in which to be married, you will say.

1067
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,120
No; frozen spots are not good at any time.

1068
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,400
But Molly’s own nature gave her due punishment.

1069
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:25,400
Through all these days of her warm happiness a chill current
ran, like those which interrupt the swimmer’s perfect joy.

1070
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:39,720
The girl was only half as happy as her lover; but she hid this deep from him⁠—hid it until that final, fierce hour of reckoning that her
nature had with her⁠—nay, was bound to have with her, before the punishment was lifted, and the frozen spot melted at length from her heart.

1071
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,320
So, meanwhile, she made her decree against Bennington.

1072
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,960
Not Vermont, but Wyoming, should be her wedding place.

1073
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:51,880
No world’s voices should be whispering, no world’s eyes should be
looking on, when she made her vow to him and received his vow.

1074
01:34:51,880 --> 01:35:01,920
Those voices should be spoken and that ring put on in this wild Cattle Land, where
first she had seen him ride into the flooded river, and lift her ashore upon his horse.

1075
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:08,360
It was this open sky which should shine down on them, and this
frontier soil upon which their feet should tread.

1076
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,280
The world should take its turn second.

1077
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:37,880
After a month with him by stream and canyon, a month far deeper into the mountain wilds than ever yet he had been free to take her, a month with sometimes a tent and sometimes the stars above them, and only their horses besides
themselves⁠—after such a month as this, she would take him to her mother and to Bennington; and the old aunt over at Dunbarton would look at him, and be once more able to declare that the Starks had always preferred a man who was a man.

1078
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:43,880
And so July third was to be engraved inside the wedding ring.


1079
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,240
Upon the other ring the Virginian had spent much delicious meditation,
all in his secret mind.

1080
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,360
He had even got the right measure of her finger without her suspecting
the reason.

1081
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,320
But this step was the final one in his plan.

1082
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:08,760
During the time that his thoughts had begun to be busy over the other ring, by a chance
he had learned from Mrs. Henry a number of old fancies regarding precious stones.

1083
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:18,240
Mrs. Henry often accompanied the Judge in venturesome mountain climbs, and
sometimes the steepness of the rocks required her to use her hands for safety.

1084
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:30,400
One day when the Virginian went with them to help mark out certain boundary corners, she removed
her rings lest they should get scratched; and he, being just behind her, took them during the climb.

1085
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,840
“I see you’re looking at my topaz,” she had said, as he returned
them.

1086
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:40,960
“If I could have chosen, it would have been a ruby. But I was
born in November.”

1087
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:54,080
He did not understand her in the least, but her words awakened exceeding interest
in him; and they had descended some five miles of mountain before he spoke again.

1088
01:36:54,080 --> 01:37:02,480
Then he became ingenious, for he had half worked out what Mrs.
Henry’s meaning must be; but he must make quite sure.

1089
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,960
Therefore, according to his wild, shy nature, he became ingenious.


1090
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,960
“Men wear rings,” he began.

1091
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,960
“Some of the men on the ranch do. I don’t see any harm in a man’s
wearin’ a ring. But I never have.”

1092
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:17,400
“Well,” said the lady, not yet suspecting that he was undertaking
to circumvent her, “probably those men have sweethearts.”

1093
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,360
“No, ma’am.

1094
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:22,520
Not sweethearts worth wearin’ rings for⁠—in two cases, anyway.


1095
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,240
They won ’em at cyards.

1096
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:27,040
And they like to see ’em shine.

1097
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,480
I never saw a man wear a topaz.”

1098
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,920
Mrs. Henry did not have any further remark to make.

1099
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,680
“I was born in January myself,” pursued the Virginian, very thoughtfully.


1100
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:42,320
Then the lady gave him one look, and without further process
of mind perceived exactly what he was driving at.

1101
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:46,760
“That’s very extravagant for rings,” said she.

1102
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,880
“January is diamonds.”

1103
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,520
“Diamonds,” murmured the Virginian, more and more thoughtfully.


1104
01:37:52,520 --> 01:38:00,440
“Well, it don’t matter, for I’d not wear a ring. And November
is⁠—what did yu’ say, ma’am?”

1105
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:00,880
“Topaz.”

1106
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:01,040
“Yes.

1107
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,000
Well, jewels are cert’nly pretty things.

1108
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,160
In the Spanish Missions yu’ll see large ones now and again.

1109
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,960
And they’re not glass, I think.

1110
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:15,840
And so they have got some jewel that kind of belongs to each
month right around the twelve?”

1111
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,600
“Yes,” said Mrs. Henry, smiling.

1112
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:22,200
“One for each month. But the opal is what you want.”

1113
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,120
He looked at her, and began to blush.

1114
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:36,160
“October is the opal,” she added, and she laughed outright, for
Miss Wood’s birthday was on the fifteenth of that month.

1115
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,120
The Virginian smiled guiltily at her through his crimson.

1116
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:46,200
“I’ve no doubt you can beat around the bush very well with men,”
said Mrs. Henry.

1117
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:52,920
“But it’s perfectly transparent with us⁠—in matters of sentiment,
at least.”

1118
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,560
“Well, I am sorry,” he presently said.

1119
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,600
“I don’t want to give her an opal.

1120
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:03,520
I have no superstition, but I don’t want to give her an opal.


1121
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,320
If her mother did, or anybody like that, why, all right.

1122
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,120
But not from me.

1123
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,960
D’ yu’ understand, ma’am?”

1124
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:22,680
Mrs. Henry did understand this subtle trait in the wild man, and she
rejoiced to be able to give him immediate reassurance concerning opals.

1125
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,440
“Don’t worry about that,” she said.

1126
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:33,680
“The opal is said to bring ill luck, but not when it is your
own month stone.

1127
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:44,040
Then it is supposed to be not only deprived of evil influence,
but to possess peculiarly fortunate power.

1128
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,720
Let it be an opal ring.”

1129
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:52,840
Then he asked her boldly various questions, and she showed him
her rings, and gave him advice about the setting.

1130
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:59,640
There was no special custom, she told him, ruling such rings
as this he desired to bestow.

1131
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:07,080
The gem might be the lady’s favorite or the lover’s favorite;
and to choose the lady’s month stone was very well indeed.

1132
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,960
Very well indeed, the Virginian thought.

1133
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,080
But not quite well enough for him.

1134
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:22,240
His mind now busied itself with this lore concerning jewels, and soon
his sentiment had suggested something which he forthwith carried out.

1135
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,920
When the ring was achieved, it was an opal, but set with four
small embracing diamonds.

1136
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:33,200
Thus was her month stone joined with his, that their luck and
their love might be inseparably clasped.

1137
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:37,840
He found the size of her finger one day when winter had departed,
and the early grass was green.

1138
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,720
He made a ring of twisted grass for her, while she held her hand
for him to bind it.

1139
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,960
He made another for himself.

1140
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:50,000
Then, after each had worn their grass ring for a while, he begged
her to exchange.

1141
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,640
He did not send his token away from him, but most carefully measured
it.

1142
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:59,000
Thus the ring fitted her well, and the lustrous flame within
the opal thrilled his heart each time he saw it.

1143
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:13,040
For now June was near its end; and that other plain gold ring, which, for safe keeping, he cherished
suspended round his neck day and night, seemed to burn with an inward glow that was deeper than the opal’s.

1144
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,360
So in due course arrived the second of July.

1145
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:25,480
Molly’s punishment had got as far as this: she longed for her
mother to be near her at this time; but it was too late.

1146
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,600
CHAPTER XXXV

1147
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,280
With Malice Aforethought

1148
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:39,960
Town lay twelve straight miles before the lover and his sweetheart,
when they came to the brow of the last long hill.

1149
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:54,040
All beneath them was like a map: neither man nor beast distinguishable, but the veined and tinted image
of a country, knobs and flats set out in order clearly, shining extensive and motionless in the sun.

1150
01:41:54,040 --> 01:42:04,720
It opened on the sight of the lovers as they reached the sudden edge of the tableland, where
since morning they had ridden with the head of neither horse ever in advance of the other.

1151
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:23,160
At the view of their journey’s end, the Virginian looked down at his girl beside him, his eyes filled with a bridegroom’s
light, and, hanging safe upon his breast, he could feel the gold ring that he would slowly press upon her finger tomorrow.

1152
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:30,520
He drew off the glove from her left hand, and stooping, kissed
the jewel in that other ring which he had given her.

1153
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:39,920
The crimson fire in the opal seemed to mingle with that in his heart, and
his arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle as he held her to him.

1154
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:46,920
But in her heart the love of him was troubled by that cold pang of
loneliness which had crept upon her like a tide as the day drew near.

1155
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:52,000
None of her own people were waiting in that distant town to see
her become his bride.

1156
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:09,560
Friendly faces she might pass on the way; but all of them new friends, made in this wild country: not a face of
her childhood would smile upon her; and deep within her, a voice cried for the mother who was far away in Vermont.

1157
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:14,800
That she would see Mrs. Taylor’s kind face at her wedding was
no comfort now.

1158
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,960
There lay the town in the splendor of Wyoming space.

1159
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:33,000
Around it spread the watered fields, westward for a little way, eastward to a great distance, making
squares of green and yellow crops; and the town was but a poor rag in the midst of this quilted harvest.

1160
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:41,600
After the fields to the east, the tawny plain began; and with one faint
furrow of river lining its undulations, it stretched beyond sight.

1161
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:50,680
But west of the town rose the Bow Leg Mountains, cool with their
still unmelted snows and their dull blue gulfs of pine.

1162
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,600
From three canyons flowed three clear forks which began the river.


1163
01:43:54,600 --> 01:44:08,080
Their confluence was above the town a good two miles; it looked but a few paces from up here,
while each side the river straggled the margin cottonwoods, like thin borders along a garden walk.

1164
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:12,240
Over all this map hung silence like a harmony, tremendous yet
serene.

1165
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:16,320
“How beautiful! how I love it!” whispered the girl.

1166
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,160
“But, oh, how big it is!”

1167
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,240
And she leaned against her lover for an instant.

1168
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,080
It was her spirit seeking shelter.

1169
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:28,640
Today, this vast beauty, this primal calm, had in it for her
something almost of dread.

1170
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:32,520
The small, comfortable, green hills of home rose before her.

1171
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:47,000
She closed her eyes and saw Vermont: a village street, and the post-office, and ivy
covering an old front door, and her mother picking some yellow roses from a bush.

1172
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:54,400
At a sound, her eyes quickly opened; and here was her lover turned
in his saddle, watching another horseman approach.

1173
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:59,760
She saw the Virginian’s hand in a certain position, and knew
that his pistol was ready.

1174
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,760
But the other merely overtook and passed them, as they stood
at the brow of the hill.

1175
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:14,160
The man had given one nod to the Virginian, and the Virginian one
to him; and now he was already below them on the descending road.

1176
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,280
To Molly Wood he was a stranger;

1177
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:27,400
but she had seen his eyes when he nodded to her lover, and she knew,
even without the pistol, that this was not enmity at first sight.

1178
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,240
It was not indeed.

1179
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,560
Five years of gathered hate had looked out of the man’s eyes.


1180
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,920
And she asked her lover who this was.

1181
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,040
“Oh,” said he, easily, “just a man I see now and then.”

1182
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,400
“Is his name Trampas?” said Molly Wood.

1183
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,000
The Virginian looked at her in surprise.

1184
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,720
“Why, where have you seen him?” he asked.

1185
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,680
“Never till now. But I knew.”

1186
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:56,080
“My gracious! Yu’ never told me yu’ had mind-reading powers.”


1187
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,880
And he smiled serenely at her.

1188
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,080
“I knew it was Trampas as soon as I saw his eyes.”

1189
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:06,880
“My gracious!” her lover repeated with indulgent irony.

1190
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,720
“I must be mighty careful of my eyes when you’re lookin’ at ’em.”


1191
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:12,440
“I believe he did that murder,” said the girl.

1192
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:16,080
“Whose mind are yu’ readin’ now?” he drawled affectionately.

1193
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,320
But he could not joke her off the subject.

1194
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:26,240
She took his strong hand in hers, tremulously, so much of it
as her little hand could hold.

1195
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:33,160
“I know something about that⁠—that⁠—last autumn,” she said, shrinking
from words more definite.

1196
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:34,400
“And I know that you only did⁠—”

1197
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,840
“What I had to,” he finished, very sadly, but sternly, too.

1198
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,920
“Yes,” she asserted, keeping hold of his hand.

1199
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:46,400
“I suppose that⁠—lynching⁠—” (she almost whispered the word)
“is the only way.

1200
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,480
But when they had to die just for stealing horses, it seems so
wicked that this murderer⁠—”

1201
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,360
“Who can prove it?” asked the Virginian.

1202
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,600
“But don’t you know it?”

1203
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,840
“I know a heap o’ things inside my heart.

1204
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,720
But that’s not proving.

1205
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:07,760
There was only the body, and the hoofprints⁠—and what folks guessed.”


1206
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,360
“He was never even arrested!” the girl said.

1207
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:18,840
“No. He helped elect the sheriff in that county.”

1208
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,840
Then Molly ventured a step inside the border of her lover’s reticence.


1209
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:28,600
“I saw⁠—” she hesitated, “just now, I saw what you did.”

1210
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,720
He returned to his caressing irony.

1211
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:35,880
“You’ll have me plumb scared if you keep on seein’ things.”

1212
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,520
“You had your pistol ready for him.”

1213
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:44,080
“Why, I believe I did. It was mighty unnecessary.”

1214
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:51,840
And the Virginian took out the pistol again, and shook his head
over it, like one who has been caught in a blunder.

1215
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:57,680
She looked at him, and knew that she must step outside his reticence
again.

1216
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:02,880
By love and her surrender to him their positions had been exchanged.


1217
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:11,400
He was not now, as through his long courting he had been, her
half-obeying, half-refractory worshipper.

1218
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,760
She was no longer his half-indulgent, half-scornful superior.


1219
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:32,400
Her better birth and schooling that had once been weapons to keep him at his distance, or bring
her off victorious in their encounters, had given way before the onset of the natural man himself.

1220
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:39,280
She knew her cowboy lover, with all that he lacked, to be more
than ever she could be, with all that she had.

1221
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,440
He was her worshipper still, but her master, too.

1222
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:48,280
Therefore now, against the baffling smile he gave her, she felt
powerless.

1223
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,000
And once again a pang of yearning for her mother to be near her
today shot through the girl.

1224
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:01,520
She looked from her untamed man to the untamed desert of Wyoming,
and the town where she was to take him as her wedded husband.

1225
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:05,360
But for his sake she would not let him guess her loneliness.

1226
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:09,080
He sat on his horse Monte, considering the pistol.

1227
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:13,200
Then he showed her a rattlesnake coiled by the roots of some
sagebrush.

1228
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,360
“Can I hit it?” he inquired.

1229
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:21,600
“You don’t often miss them,” said she, striving to be cheerful.


1230
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:28,440
“Well, I’m told getting married unstrings some men.”

1231
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,200
He aimed, and the snake was shattered.

1232
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:34,160
“Maybe it’s too early yet for the unstringing to begin!”

1233
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:40,480
And with some deliberation he sent three more bullets into the
snake.

1234
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,960
“I reckon that’s enough,” said he.

1235
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:44,680
“Was not the first one?”

1236
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:47,240
“Oh, yes, for the snake.”

1237
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:57,600
And then, with one leg crooked cowboy fashion across in front of his
saddle-horn, he cleaned his pistol, and replaced the empty cartridges.

1238
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:01,720
Once more she ventured near the line of his reticence.

1239
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,960
“Has⁠—has Trampas seen you much lately?”

1240
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:12,320
“Why, no; not for a right smart while. But I reckon he has not
missed me.”

1241
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,640
The Virginian spoke this in his gentlest voice.

1242
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:22,520
But his rebuffed sweetheart turned her face away, and from her
eyes she brushed a tear.

1243
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:27,760
He reined his horse Monte beside her, and upon her cheek she
felt his kiss.

1244
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:32,360
“You are not the only mind-reader,” said he, very tenderly.

1245
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:37,480
And at this she clung to him, and laid her head upon his breast.


1246
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:44,600
“I had been thinking,” he went on, “that the way our marriage
is to be was the most beautiful way.”

1247
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:47,520
“It is the most beautiful,” she murmured.

1248
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:54,160
He slowly spoke out his thought, as if she had not said this.


1249
01:50:54,160 --> 01:51:09,680
“No folks to stare, no fuss, no jokes and ribbons and best bonnets, no public
eye nor talkin’ of tongues when most yu’ want to hear nothing and say nothing.”

1250
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,480
She answered by holding him closer.

1251
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:20,160
“Just the bishop of Wyoming to join us, and not even him after
we’re once joined.

1252
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:24,040
I did think that would be ahead of all ways to get married I
have seen.”

1253
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:27,040
He paused again, and she made no rejoinder.

1254
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,240
“But we have left out your mother.”

1255
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,920
She looked in his face with quick astonishment.

1256
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,520
It was as if his spirit had heard the cry of her spirit.

1257
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,080
“That is nowhere near right,” he said.

1258
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,800
“That is wrong.”

1259
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,200
“She could never have come here,” said the girl.

1260
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:47,640
“We should have gone there. I don’t know how I can ask her to
forgive me.”

1261
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:49,760
“But it was not you!” cried Molly.

1262
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,080
“Yes.

1263
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,520
Because I did not object.

1264
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:57,280
I did not tell you we must go to her.

1265
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:03,480
I missed the point, thinking so much about my own feelings.

1266
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:08,960
For you see⁠—and I’ve never said this to you until now⁠—your
mother did hurt me.

1267
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:28,400
When you said you would have me after my years of waiting, and I wrote her that letter telling her all about myself, and how my family was
not like yours, and⁠—and⁠—all the rest I told her, why you see it hurt me never to get a word back from her except just messages through you.

1268
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,560
For I had talked to her about my hopes and my failings.

1269
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:38,200
I had said more than ever I’ve said to you, because she was your
mother.

1270
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:45,720
I wanted her to forgive me, if she could, and feel that maybe
I could take good care of you after all.

1271
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:51,040
For it was bad enough to have her daughter quit her home to teach
school out hyeh on Bear Creek.

1272
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:55,680
Bad enough without havin’ me to come along and make it worse.


1273
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:59,840
I have missed the point in thinking of my own feelings.”

1274
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,840
“But it’s not your doing!” repeated Molly.

1275
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:06,280
With his deep delicacy he had put the whole matter as a hardship
to her mother alone.

1276
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:09,280
He had saved her any pain of confession or denial.

1277
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,880
“Yes, it is my doing,” he now said.

1278
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,640
“Shall we give it up?”

1279
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,040
“Give what⁠—?”

1280
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,640
She did not understand.

1281
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,880
“Why, the order we’ve got it fixed in.

1282
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,480
Plans are⁠—well, they’re no more than plans.

1283
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,720
I hate the notion of changing, but

1284
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,880
I hate hurting your mother more.

1285
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,360
Or, anyway, I ought to hate it more.

1286
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,160
So we can shift, if yu’ say so.

1287
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,440
It’s not too late.”

1288
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:35,880
“Shift?” she faltered.

1289
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:38,320
“I mean, we can go to your home now.

1290
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,520
We can start by the stage tonight.

1291
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,040
Your mother can see us married.

1292
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:48,240
We can come back and finish in the mountains instead of beginning
in them.

1293
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:52,080
It’ll be just merely shifting, yu’ see.”

1294
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:58,800
He could scarcely bring himself to say this at all; yet he said
it almost as if he were urging it.

1295
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,600
It implied a renunciation that he could hardly bear to think
of.

1296
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:28,200
To put off his wedding day, the bliss upon whose threshold he stood after his three years of faithful battle for it, and that wedding journey he had arranged: for there were the
mountains in sight, the woods and canyons where he had planned to go with her after the bishop had joined them; the solitudes where only the wild animals would be, besides themselves.

1297
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:37,160
His horses, his tent, his rifle, his rod, all were waiting ready
in the town for their start tomorrow.

1298
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:42,000
He had provided many dainty things to make her comfortable.

1299
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,640
Well, he could wait a little more, having waited three years.


1300
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:58,240
It would not be what his heart most desired: there would be
the “public eye and the talking of tongues”⁠—but he could wait.

1301
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:04,200
The hour would come when he could be alone with his bride at
last.

1302
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:07,880
And so he spoke as if he urged it.

1303
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,760
“Never!” she cried.

1304
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,840
“Never, never!”

1305
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:12,880
She pushed it from her.

1306
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:17,360
She would not brook such sacrifice on his part.

1307
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:21,040
Were they not going to her mother in four weeks?

1308
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:34,600
If her family had warmly accepted him⁠—but they had not; and
in any case, it had gone too far, it was too late.

1309
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:44,480
She told her lover that she would not hear him, that if he said
any more she would gallop into town separately from him.

1310
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:56,720
And for his sake she would hide deep from him this loneliness of hers, and the hurt that he had
given her in refusing to share with her his trouble with Trampas, when others must know of it.

1311
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:03,840
Accordingly, they descended the hill slowly together, lingering
to spin out these last miles long.

1312
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:23,840
Many rides had taught their horses to go side by side, and so they went now: the girl sweet and thoughtful in her sedate gray habit; and
the man in his leathern chaps and cartridge belt and flannel shirt, looking gravely into the distance with the level gaze of the frontier.

1313
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:30,840
Having read his sweetheart’s mind very plainly, the lover now
broke his dearest custom.

1314
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,600
It was his code never to speak ill of any man to any woman.

1315
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:36,400
Men’s quarrels were not for women’s ears.

1316
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:40,760
In his scheme, good women were to know only a fragment of men’s
lives.

1317
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:47,320
He had lived many outlaw years, and his wide knowledge of evil
made innocence doubly precious to him.

1318
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:55,120
But today he must depart from his code, having read her mind
well.

1319
01:56:55,120 --> 01:57:00,760
He would speak evil of one man to one woman, because his reticence
had hurt her⁠—and

1320
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:05,080
was she not far from her mother, and very lonely, do what he
could?

1321
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:09,440
She should know the story of his quarrel in language as light
and casual as he could veil it with.

1322
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:09,920
He made an oblique start.

1323
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:14,320
He did not say to her: “I’ll tell you about this.

1324
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:19,560
You saw me get ready for Trampas because I have been ready for
him any time these five years.”

1325
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:30,000
He began far off from the point with that rooted caution of his⁠—that
caution which is shared by the primal savage and the perfected diplomat.

1326
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,960
“There’s cert’nly a right smart o’ difference between men and
women,” he observed.

1327
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:38,360
“You’re quite sure?” she retorted.

1328
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:42,720
“Ain’t it fortunate?⁠—that there’s both, I mean.”

1329
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:50,480
“I don’t know about fortunate. Machinery could probably do all
the heavy work for us without your help.”

1330
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,760
“And who’d invent the machinery?”

1331
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:53,600
She laughed.

1332
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:00,960
“We shouldn’t need the huge, noisy things you do. Our world would
be a gentle one.”

1333
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,200
“Oh, my gracious!”

1334
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:04,480
“What do you mean by that?”

1335
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:10,640
“Oh, my gracious! Get along, Monte! A gentle world all full of
ladies!”

1336
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,920
“Do you call men gentle?” inquired Molly.

1337
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,120
“Now it’s a funny thing about that.

1338
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:18,000
Have yu’ ever noticed a joke about fathers-in-law?

1339
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,760
There’s just as many fathers⁠—as mothers-in-law; but which side
are your jokes?”

1340
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:22,720
Molly was not vanquished.

1341
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:27,200
“That’s because the men write the comic papers,” said she.

1342
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:36,400
“Hear that, Monte? The men write ’em. Well, if the ladies wrote
a comic paper, I expect that might be gentle.”

1343
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:40,440
She gave up this battle in mirth; and he resumed:⁠

1344
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:40,560
—

1345
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:46,080
“But don’t you really reckon it’s uncommon to meet a father-in-law
flouncin’ around the house?

1346
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:51,240
As for gentle⁠—Once I had to sleep in a room next a ladies’ temperance
meetin’.

1347
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,160
Oh, heavens!

1348
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:59,760
Well, I couldn’t change my room, and the hotel man, he apologized
to me next mawnin’.

1349
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:05,320
Said it didn’t surprise him the husbands drank some.”

1350
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:13,400
Here the Virginian broke down over his own fantastic inventions,
and gave a joyous chuckle in company with his sweetheart.

1351
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:18,880
“Yes, there’s a big heap o’ difference between men and women,”
he said.

1352
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,360
“Take that fello’ and myself, now.”

1353
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,920
“Trampas?” said Molly, quickly serious.

1354
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:30,760
She looked along the road ahead, and discerned the figure of
Trampas still visible on its way to town.

1355
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:36,400
The Virginian did not wish her to be serious⁠—more than could
be helped.

1356
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:41,040
“Why, yes,” he replied, with a waving gesture at Trampas.

1357
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,000
“Take him and me.

1358
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,080
He don’t think much o’ me!

1359
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,160
How could he?

1360
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,760
And I expect he’ll never.

1361
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,720
But yu’ saw just now how it was between us.

1362
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:55,440
We were not a bit like a temperance meetin’.”

1363
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:01,840
She could not help laughing at the twist he gave to his voice.


1364
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:12,080
And she felt happiness warming her; for in the Virginian’s tone
about Trampas was something now that no longer excluded her.

1365
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:23,080
Thus he began his gradual recital, in a cadence always easy,
and more and more musical with the native accent of the South.

1366
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:29,000
With the light turn he gave it, its pure ugliness melted into
charm.

1367
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,440
“No, he don’t think anything of me.

1368
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:39,080
Once a man in the John Day Valley didn’t think much, and by Cañada
de Oro I met another.

1369
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:41,880
It will always be so here and there, but Trampas beats ’em all.


1370
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:46,560
For the others have always expressed themselves⁠—got shut of
their poor opinion in the open air.”

1371
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:54,280
“Yu’ see, I had to explain myself to Trampas a right smart while
ago, long before ever I laid my eyes on yu’.

1372
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,520
It was just nothing at all.

1373
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:01,520
A little matter of cyards in the days when I was apt to spend
my money and my holidays pretty headlong.

1374
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,120
My gracious, what nonsensical times I have had!

1375
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:08,840
But I was apt to win at cyards, ’specially poker.

1376
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:16,480
And Trampas, he met me one night, and I expect he must have thought
I looked kind o’ young.

1377
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:23,400
So he hated losin’ his money to such a young-lookin’ man, and
he took his way of sayin’ as much.

1378
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:29,880
I had to explain myself to him plainly, so that he learned right
away my age had got its growth.

1379
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:42,960
“Well, I expect he hated that worse, having to receive my explanation with folks lookin’ on
at us publicly that-a-way, and him without further ideas occurrin’ to him at the moment.

1380
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:49,160
That’s what started his poor opinion of me, not havin’ ideas
at the moment.

1381
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,480
And so the boys resumed their cyards.

1382
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:54,920
“I’d most forgot about it.

1383
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:59,520
But Trampas’s mem’ry is one of his strong points.

1384
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:13,720
Next thing⁠—oh, it’s a good while later⁠—he gets to losin’ flesh because
Judge Henry gave me charge of him and some other punchers taking cattle⁠—”

1385
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:16,280
“That’s not next,” interrupted the girl.

1386
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,640
“Not? Why⁠—”

1387
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:20,400
“Don’t you remember?” she said, timid, yet eager.

1388
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:21,280
“Don’t you?”

1389
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,280
“Blamed if I do!”

1390
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,640
“The first time we met?”

1391
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:27,920
“Yes; my mem’ry keeps that⁠—like I keep this.”

1392
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:38,760
And he brought from his pocket her own handkerchief, the token he had picked
up at a river’s brink when he had carried her from an overturned stage.

1393
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,800
“We did not exactly meet, then,” she said.

1394
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:44,000
“It was at that dance.

1395
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I hadn’t seen you yet; but Trampas was saying something horrid about me, and you
said⁠—you said, ‘Rise on your legs, you pole cat, and tell them you’re a liar.’

1396
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,560
When I heard that, I think⁠—I think it finished me.”

1397
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:02,640
And crimson suffused Molly’s countenance.

1398
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,200
“I’d forgot,” the Virginian murmured.

1399
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,440
Then sharply, “How did you hear it?”

1400
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,480
“Mrs. Taylor⁠—”

1401
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:12,800
“Oh! Well, a man would never have told a woman that.”

1402
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,520
Molly laughed triumphantly.

1403
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,800
“Then who told Mrs. Taylor?”

1404
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,240
Being caught, he grinned at her.

1405
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:21,360
“I reckon husbands are a special kind of man,” was all that he
found to say.

1406
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:27,360
“Well, since you do know about that, it was the next move in
the game.

1407
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:35,120
Trampas thought I had no call to stop him sayin’ what he pleased
about a woman who was nothin’ to me⁠—then.

1408
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:37,440
But all women ought to be somethin’ to a man.

1409
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:45,600
So I had to give Trampas another explanation in the presence
of folks lookin’ on, and it was just like the cyards.

1410
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,160
No ideas occurred to him again.

1411
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:53,040
And down goes his opinion of me some more!

1412
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,160
“Well, I have not been able to raise it.

1413
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:09,920
There has been this and that and the other⁠—yu’ know most of the later doings yourself⁠—and
today is the first time I’ve happened to see the man since the doings last autumn.

1414
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:12,360
Yu’ seem to know about them, too.

1415
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:15,680
He knows I can’t prove he was with that gang of horse thieves.


1416
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,440
And I can’t prove he killed poor Shorty.

1417
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:23,880
But he knows I missed him awful close, and spoiled his thieving
for a while.

1418
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:28,720
So d’ yu’ wonder he don’t think much of me?

1419
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:37,480
But if I had lived to be twenty-nine years old like I am, and
with all my chances made no enemy, I’d feel myself a failure.”

1420
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:39,600
His story was finished.

1421
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:50,000
He had made her his confidant in matters he had never spoken
of before, and she was happy to be thus much nearer to him.

1422
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,000
It diminished a certain fear that was mingled with her love of
him.

1423
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:02,360
During the next several miles he was silent, and his silence
was enough for her.

1424
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:07,480
Vermont sank away from her thoughts, and Wyoming held less of
loneliness.

1425
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:24,240
They descended altogether into the map which had stretched below them, so that it was a map no longer,
but earth with growing things, and prairie-dogs sitting upon it, and now and then a bird flying over it.

1426
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,840
And after a while she said to him, “What are you thinking about?”


1427
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,200
“I have been doing sums.

1428
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,720
Figured in hours it sounds right short.

1429
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,880
Figured in minutes it boils up into quite a mess.

1430
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,720
Twenty by sixty is twelve hundred.

1431
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:45,760
Put that into seconds, and yu’ get seventy-two thousand seconds.


1432
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,760
Seventy-two thousand.

1433
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:53,040
Seventy-two thousand seconds yet before we get married.”

1434
02:05:53,040 --> 02:06:01,240
“Seconds! To think of its having come to seconds!”

1435
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:09,680
“I am thinkin’ about it. I’m choppin’ sixty of ’em off every
minute.”

1436
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:11,600
With such chopping time wears away.

1437
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:28,760
More miles of the road lay behind them, and in the virgin wilderness the
scars of new-scraped water ditches began to appear, and the first wire fences.

1438
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:36,680
Next, they were passing cabins and occasional fields, the outposts
of habitation.

1439
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:44,440
The free road became wholly imprisoned, running between unbroken
stretches of barbed wire.

1440
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:56,480
Far off to the eastward a flowing column of dust marked the approaching stage,
bringing the bishop, probably, for whose visit here they had timed their wedding.

1441
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:09,160
The day still brimmed with heat and sunshine; but the great daily shadow was
beginning to move from the feet of the Bow Leg Mountains outward toward the town.

1442
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,800
Presently they began to meet citizens.

1443
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:15,640
Some of these knew them and nodded, while some did not, and stared.


1444
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:26,080
Turning a corner into the town’s chief street, where stood the hotel, the bank, the
drug store, the general store, and the seven saloons, they were hailed heartily.

1445
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:35,560
Here were three friends⁠—Honey Wiggin, Scipio Le Moyne, and Lin McLean⁠—all
desirous of drinking the Virginian’s health, if his lady⁠—would she mind?

1446
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:41,280
The three stood grinning, with their hats off; but behind their
gaiety the Virginian read some other purpose.

1447
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:45,000
“We’ll all be very good,” said Honey Wiggin.

1448
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,400
“Pretty good,” said Lin.

1449
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,000
“Good,” said Scipio.

1450
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:54,400
“Which is the honest man?” inquired Molly, glad to see them.

1451
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,520
“Not one!” said the Virginian.

1452
02:07:56,520 --> 02:08:00,200
“My old friends scare me when I think of their ways.”

1453
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:06,160
“It’s bein’ engaged scares yu’,” retorted Mr. McLean.

1454
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:09,560
“Marriage restores your courage, I find.”

1455
02:08:09,560 --> 02:08:12,960
“Well, I’ll trust all of you,” said Molly.

1456
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:21,000
“He’s going to take me to the hotel, and then you can drink his
health as much as you please.”

1457
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:28,080
With a smile to them she turned to proceed, and he let his horse
move with hers; but he looked at his friends.

1458
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:35,200
Then Scipio’s bleached blue eyes narrowed to a slit, and he said
what they had all come out on the street to say:⁠—

1459
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,280
“Don’t change your clothes.”

1460
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:43,200
“Oh!” protested Molly, “isn’t he rather dusty and countrified?”


1461
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:48,400
But the Virginian had taken Scipio’s meaning.

1462
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,520
“Don’t change your clothes.”

1463
02:08:51,520 --> 02:09:01,960
Innocent Molly appreciated these words no more than the average reader who reads a
masterpiece, complacently unaware that its style differs from that of the morning paper.

1464
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:05,720
Such was Scipio’s intention, wishing to spare her from alarm.


1465
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:10,800
So at the hotel she let her lover go with a kiss, and without
a thought of Trampas.

1466
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:15,840
She in her room unlocked the possessions which were there waiting
for her, and changed her dress.

1467
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:26,360
Wedding garments, and other civilized apparel proper for a genuine frontiersman
when he comes to town, were also in the hotel, ready for the Virginian to wear.

1468
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:34,480
It is only the somewhat green and unseasoned cowpuncher who struts
before the public in spurs and deadly weapons.

1469
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:37,240
For many a year the Virginian had put away these childish things.


1470
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,760
He made a sober toilet for the streets.

1471
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:44,360
Nothing but his face and bearing remained out of the common when
he was in a town.

1472
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:56,320
But Scipio had told him not to change his clothes; therefore
he went out with his pistol at his hip.

1473
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,400
Soon he had joined his three friends.

1474
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,440
“I’m obliged to yu’,” he said.

1475
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:04,680
“He passed me this mawnin’.”

1476
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:08,760
“We don’t know his intentions,” said Wiggin.

1477
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:14,640
“Except that he’s hangin’ around,” said McLean.

1478
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:20,280
“And fillin’ up,” said Scipio, “which reminds me⁠—”

1479
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:25,240
They strolled into the saloon of a friend, where, unfortunately,
sat some foolish people.

1480
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:29,280
But one cannot always tell how much of a fool a man is, at sight.


1481
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:34,680
It was a temperate health-drinking that they made.

1482
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:42,880
“Here’s how,” they muttered softly to the Virginian; and “How,”
he returned softly, looking away from them.

1483
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:50,440
But they had a brief meeting of eyes, standing and lounging near
each other, shyly; and Scipio shook hands with the bridegroom.

1484
02:10:50,440 --> 02:11:01,040
“Some day,” he stated, tapping himself; for in his vagrant
heart he began to envy the man who could bring himself to marry.

1485
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:05,600
And he nodded again, repeating, “Here’s how.”

1486
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:13,880
They stood at the bar, full of sentiment, empty of words, memory
and affection busy in their hearts.

1487
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:21,280
All of them had seen rough days together, and they felt guilty
with emotion.

1488
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:24,800
“It’s hot weather,” said Wiggin.

1489
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,760
“Hotter on Box Elder,” said McLean.

1490
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,240
“My kid has started teething.”

1491
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:34,720
Words ran dry again.

1492
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:39,680
They shifted their positions, looked in their glasses, read the
labels on the bottles.

1493
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:46,880
They dropped a word now and then to the proprietor about his
trade, and his ornaments.

1494
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:49,840
“Good head,” commented McLean.

1495
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:53,400
“Big old ram,” assented the proprietor.

1496
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:59,480
“Shot him myself on Gray Bull last fall.”

1497
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:04,800
“Sheep was thick in the Tetons last fall,” said the Virginian.


1498
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:10,520
On the bar stood a machine into which the idle customer might
drop his nickel.

1499
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:17,800
The coin then bounced among an arrangement of pegs, descending
at length into one or another of various holes.

1500
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:27,400
You might win as much as ten times your stake, but this was not
the most usual result; and with nickels

1501
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:33,800
the three friends and the bridegroom now mildly sported for a
while, buying them with silver when their store ran out.

1502
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:45,280
“Was it sheep you went after in the Tetons?” inquired the proprietor,
knowing it was horse thieves.

1503
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,480
“Yes,” said the Virginian.

1504
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,880
“I’ll have ten more nickels.”

1505
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:54,720
“Did you get all the sheep you wanted?” the proprietor continued.


1506
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,120
“Poor luck,” said the Virginian.

1507
02:12:56,120 --> 02:13:01,160
“Think there’s a friend of yours in town this afternoon,” said
the proprietor.

1508
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:03,560
“Did he mention he was my friend?”

1509
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:04,440
The proprietor laughed.

1510
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:09,320
The Virginian watched another nickel click down among the pegs.


1511
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,760
Honey Wiggin now made the bridegroom a straight offer.

1512
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:14,040
“We’ll take this thing off your hands,” said he.

1513
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:16,000
“Any or all of us,” said Lin.

1514
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,960
But Scipio held his peace.

1515
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:27,080
His loyalty went every inch as far as theirs, but his understanding
of his friend went deeper.

1516
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:35,520
“Don’t change your clothes,” was the first and the last help
he would be likely to give in this matter.

1517
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:41,400
The rest must be as such matters must always be, between man
and man.

1518
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:50,320
To the other two friends, however, this seemed a very special
case, falling outside established precedent.

1519
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,040
Therefore they ventured offers of interference.

1520
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:57,120
“A man don’t get married every day,” apologized McLean.

1521
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:01,360
“We’ll just run him out of town for yu’.”

1522
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:03,440
“Save yu’ the trouble,” urged Wiggin.

1523
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,600
“Say the word.”

1524
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:07,560
The proprietor now added his voice.

1525
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:14,720
“It’ll sober him up to spend his night out in the brush. He’ll
quit his talk then.”

1526
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:18,680
But the Virginian did not say the word, or any word.

1527
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:20,160
He stood playing with the nickels.

1528
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,160
“Think of her,” muttered McLean.

1529
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:29,240
“Who else would I be thinking of?” returned the Southerner.

1530
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:32,200
His face had become very sombre.

1531
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:35,480
“She has been raised so different!” he murmured.

1532
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:39,320
He pondered a little, while the others waited, solicitous.

1533
02:14:39,320 --> 02:14:41,840
A new idea came to the proprietor.

1534
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,720
“I am acting mayor of this town,” said he.

1535
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:52,640
“I’ll put him in the calaboose and keep him till you get married
and away.”

1536
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:55,920
“Say the word,” repeated Honey Wiggin.

1537
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:01,760
Scipio’s eye met the proprietor’s, and he shook his head about
a quarter of an inch.

1538
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,240
The proprietor shook his to the same amount.

1539
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,680
They understood each other.

1540
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:12,520
It had come to that point where there was no way out, save only
the ancient, eternal way between man and man.

1541
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:17,440
It is only the great mediocrity that goes to law in these personal
matters.

1542
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:25,520
“So he has talked about me some?” said the Virginian.

1543
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:29,160
“It’s the whiskey,” Scipio explained.

1544
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:41,080
“I expect,” said McLean, “he’d run a mile if he was in a state
to appreciate his insinuations.”

1545
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:48,160
“Which we are careful not to mention to yu’,” said Wiggin, “unless
yu’ inquire for ’em.”

1546
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:53,440
Some of the fools present had drawn closer to hear this interesting
conversation.

1547
02:15:53,440 --> 02:16:00,400
In gatherings of more than six there will generally be at
least one fool; and this company must have numbered twenty men.

1548
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:10,680
“This country knows well enough,” said one fool, who hungered to be
important, “that you don’t brand no calves that ain’t your own.”

1549
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:13,120
The saturnine Virginian looked at him.

1550
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:17,160
“Thank yu’,” said he, gravely, “for your endorsement of my character.”


1551
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,160
The fool felt flattered.

1552
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,640
The Virginian turned to his friends.

1553
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:26,520
His hand slowly pushed his hat back, and he rubbed his black
head in thought.

1554
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:31,040
“Glad to see yu’ve got your gun with you,” continued the happy
fool.

1555
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:36,280
“You know what Trampas claims about that affair of yours in the
Tetons?

1556
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:42,400
He claims that if everything was known about the killing of Shorty⁠—”


1557
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:47,440
“Take one on the house,” suggested the proprietor to him, amiably.


1558
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:51,080
“Your news will be fresher.”

1559
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:52,360
And he pushed him the bottle.

1560
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:54,840
The fool felt less important.

1561
02:16:54,840 --> 02:17:03,000
“This talk had went the rounds before it got to us,” said Scipio,
“or we’d have headed it off.

1562
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,920
He has got friends in town.”

1563
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:10,920
Perplexity knotted the Virginian’s brows.

1564
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:18,200
This community knew that a man had implied he was a thief and
a murderer; it also knew that he knew it.

1565
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:23,520
But the case was one of peculiar circumstances, assuredly.

1566
02:17:23,520 --> 02:17:25,880
Could he avoid meeting the man?

1567
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:29,400
Soon the stage would be starting south for the railroad.

1568
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:34,480
He had already today proposed to his sweetheart that they should
take it.

1569
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:38,400
Could he for her sake leave unanswered a talking enemy upon the
field?

1570
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:42,680
His own ears had not heard the enemy.

1571
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:48,360
Into these reflections the fool stepped once more.

1572
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:52,520
“Of course this country don’t believe Trampas,” said he.

1573
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,640
“This country⁠—”

1574
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:56,520
But he contributed no further thoughts.

1575
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:12,360
From somewhere in the rear of the building, where it opened upon the tin cans and the hinder
purlieus of the town, came a movement, and Trampas was among them, courageous with whiskey.

1576
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:18,120
All the fools now made themselves conspicuous.

1577
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:24,240
One lay on the floor, knocked there by the Virginian, whose arm
he had attempted to hold.

1578
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:32,280
Others struggled with Trampas, and his bullet smashed the ceiling
before they could drag the pistol from him.

1579
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:43,400
“There now! there now!” they interposed; “you don’t want to talk
like that,” for he was pouring out a tide of hate and vilification.

1580
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:52,200
Yet the Virginian stood quiet by the bar, and many an eye of
astonishment was turned upon him.

1581
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:57,040
“I’d not stand half that language,” some muttered to each other.


1582
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:03,640
Still the Virginian waited quietly, while the fools reasoned
with Trampas.

1583
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:07,760
But no earthly foot can step between a man and his destiny.

1584
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,680
Trampas broke suddenly free.

1585
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:16,120
“Your friends have saved your life,” he rang out, with obscene
epithets.

1586
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:18,360
“I’ll give you till sundown to leave town.”

1587
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:20,600
There was total silence instantly.

1588
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:25,480
“Trampas,” spoke the Virginian, “I don’t want trouble with you.”


1589
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:28,680
“He never has wanted it,” Trampas sneered to the bystanders.

1590
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:34,560
“He has been dodging it five years. But I’ve got him coralled.”


1591
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:36,920
Some of the Trampas faction smiled.

1592
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:41,080
“Trampas,” said the Virginian again, “are yu’ sure yu’ really
mean that?”

1593
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:48,760
The whiskey bottle flew through the air, hurled by Trampas, and
crashed through the saloon window behind the Virginian.

1594
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:54,120
“That was surplusage, Trampas,” said he, “if yu’ mean the other.”


1595
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:58,520
“Get out by sundown, that’s all,” said Trampas.

1596
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:02,160
And wheeling, he went out of the saloon by the rear, as he had
entered.

1597
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:07,400
“Gentlemen,” said the Virginian, “I know you will all oblige
me.”

1598
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:12,920
“Sure!” exclaimed the proprietor, heartily, “We’ll see that everybody
lets this thing alone.”

1599
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:18,600
The Virginian gave a general nod to the company, and walked out
into the street.

1600
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:23,040
“It’s a turruble shame,” sighed Scipio, “that he couldn’t have
postponed it.”

1601
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,040
The Virginian walked in the open air with thoughts disturbed.


1602
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:30,120
“I am of two minds about one thing,” he said to himself uneasily.


1603
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:37,760
Gossip ran in advance of him; but as he came by, the talk fell
away until he had passed.

1604
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:41,400
Then they looked after him, and their words again rose audibly.


1605
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:45,840
Thus everywhere a little eddy of silence accompanied his steps.


1606
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:51,560
“It don’t trouble him much,” one said, having read nothing in
the Virginian’s face.

1607
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,560
“It may trouble his girl some,” said another.

1608
02:20:54,560 --> 02:21:00,640
“She’ll not know,” said a third, “until it’s over.”

1609
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:03,400
“He’ll not tell her?”

1610
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:08,400
“I wouldn’t. It’s no woman’s business.”

1611
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:15,000
“Maybe that’s so. Well, it would have suited me to have Trampas
die sooner.”

1612
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:23,880
“How would it suit you to have him live longer?” inquired a member
of the opposite faction, suspected of being himself a cattle thief.

1613
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:33,800
“I could answer your question, if I had other folks’ calves I
wanted to brand.”

1614
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:36,240
This raised both a laugh and a silence.

1615
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:41,640
Thus the town talked, filling in the time before sunset.

1616
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:47,480
The Virginian, still walking aloof in the open air, paused at
the edge of the town.

1617
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:53,600
“I’d sooner have a sickness than be undecided this way,” he said,
and he looked up and down.

1618
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,920
Then a grim smile came at his own expense.

1619
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:00,320
“I reckon it would make me sick⁠—but there’s not time.”

1620
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:07,920
Over there in the hotel sat his sweetheart alone, away from her
mother, her friends, her home, waiting his return, knowing nothing.

1621
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,440
He looked into the west.

1622
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:21,040
Between the sun and the bright ridges of the mountains was still a space of
sky; but the shadow from the mountains’ feet had drawn halfway toward the town.

1623
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,840
“About forty minutes more,” he said aloud.

1624
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,680
“She has been raised so different.”

1625
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,240
And he sighed as he turned back.

1626
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:31,440
As he went slowly, he did not know how great was his own unhappiness.


1627
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:34,760
“She has been raised so different,” he said again.

1628
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:40,040
Opposite the post-office the bishop of Wyoming met him and greeted
him.

1629
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:42,720
His lonely heart throbbed at the warm, firm grasp of this friend’s
hand.

1630
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:46,320
The bishop saw his eyes glow suddenly, as if tears were close.


1631
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:51,880
But none came, and no word more open than, “I’m glad to see you.”


1632
02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:56,160
But gossip had reached the bishop, and he was sorely troubled
also.

1633
02:22:56,160 --> 02:23:00,680
“What is all this?” said he, coming straight to it.

1634
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:04,200
The Virginian looked at the clergyman frankly.

1635
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:08,800
“Yu’ know just as much about it as I do,” he said.

1636
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:13,320
“And I’ll tell yu’ anything yu’ ask.”

1637
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:17,520
“Have you told Miss Wood?” inquired the bishop.

1638
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:22,560
The eyes of the bridegroom fell, and the bishop’s face grew at
once more keen and more troubled.

1639
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:26,680
Then the bridegroom raised his eyes again, and the bishop almost
loved him.

1640
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:28,480
He touched his arm, like a brother.

1641
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,680
“This is hard luck,” he said.

1642
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,560
The bridegroom could scarce keep his voice steady.

1643
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:36,880
“I want to do right today more than any day I have ever lived,”
said he.

1644
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:39,080
“Then go and tell her at once.”

1645
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:42,560
“It will just do nothing but scare her.”

1646
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,640
“Go and tell her at once.”

1647
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:53,160
“I expected you was going to tell me to run away from Trampas.
I can’t do that, yu’ know.”

1648
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:53,920
The bishop did know.

1649
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:58,920
Never before in all his wilderness work had he faced such a thing.


1650
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:05,680
He knew that Trampas was an evil in the country, and that the
Virginian was a good.

1651
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:20,960
He knew that the cattle thieves⁠—the rustlers⁠—were gaining, in numbers and audacity; that they led many weak young
fellows to ruin; that they elected their men to office, and controlled juries; that they were a staring menace to Wyoming.

1652
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,400
His heart was with the Virginian.

1653
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:30,640
But there was his Gospel, that he preached, and believed, and
tried to live.

1654
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:37,120
He stood looking at the ground and drawing a finger along his
eyebrow.

1655
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:40,840
He wished that he might have heard nothing about all this.

1656
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:48,760
But he was not one to blink his responsibility as a Christian
server of the church militant.

1657
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:57,040
“Am I right,” he now slowly asked, “in believing that you think
I am a sincere man?”

1658
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,360
“I don’t believe anything about it. I know it.”

1659
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:04,320
“I should run away from Trampas,” said the bishop.

1660
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:06,120
“That ain’t quite fair, seh.

1661
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:11,200
We all understand you have got to do the things you tell other
folks to do.

1662
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,160
And you do them, seh.

1663
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:17,480
You never talk like anything but a man, and you never set yourself
above others.

1664
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:21,360
You can saddle your own horses.

1665
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:34,440
And I saw yu’ walk unarmed into that White River excitement when those
two other parsons was a-foggin’ and a-fannin’ for their own safety.

1666
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:36,160
Damn scoundrels!”

1667
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:48,160
The bishop instantly rebuked such language about brothers of his
cloth, even though he disapproved both of them and their doctrines.

1668
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,240
“Everyone may be an instrument of Providence,” he concluded.

1669
02:25:53,240 --> 02:26:04,440
“Well,” said the Virginian, “if that is so, then Providence makes
use of instruments I’d not touch with a ten-foot pole.

1670
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:09,800
Now if you was me, seh, and not a bishop, would you run away
from Trampas?”

1671
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:15,680
“That’s not quite fair, either!” exclaimed the bishop, with a
smile.

1672
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:22,120
“Because you are asking me to take another man’s convictions,
and yet remain myself.”

1673
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:30,880
“Yes, seh. I am. That’s so. That don’t get at it. I reckon you
and I can’t get at it.”

1674
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:36,400
“If the Bible,” said the bishop, “which I believe to be God’s
word, was anything to you⁠—”

1675
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:42,120
“It is something to me, seh. I have found fine truths in it.”


1676
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:45,360
“ ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ ” quoted the bishop.

1677
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:47,160
“That is plain.”

1678
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:50,520
The Virginian took his turn at smiling.

1679
02:26:50,520 --> 02:27:03,200
“Mighty plain to me, seh. Make it plain to Trampas, and there’ll
be no killin’. We can’t get at it that way.”

1680
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:05,720
Once more the bishop quoted earnestly.

1681
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:10,800
“ ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.’”

1682
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:13,520
“How about instruments of Providence, seh?

1683
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:16,360
Why, we can’t get at it that way.

1684
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:21,320
If you start usin’ the Bible that way, it will mix you up mighty
quick, seh.”

1685
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:29,160
“My friend,” the bishop urged, and all his good, warm heart was
in it, “my dear fellow⁠—go away for the one night.

1686
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:31,680
He’ll change his mind.”

1687
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,600
The Virginian shook his head.

1688
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,160
“He cannot change his word, seh.

1689
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:41,320
Or at least I must stay around till he does.

1690
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:44,120
Why, I have given him the say-so.

1691
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:45,600
He’s got the choice.

1692
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:50,600
Most men would not have took what I took from him in the saloon.


1693
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:55,160
Why don’t you ask him to leave town?”

1694
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:58,040
The good bishop was at a standstill.

1695
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:12,160
Of all kicking against the pricks none is so hard as this kick of
a professing Christian against the whole instinct of human man.

1696
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:16,800
“But you have helped me some,” said the Virginian.

1697
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:23,840
“I will go and tell her. At least, if I think it will be good
for her, I will tell her.”

1698
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:28,680
The bishop thought that he saw one last chance to move him.

1699
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:32,400
“You’re twenty-nine,” he began.

1700
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:35,000
“And a little over,” said the Virginian.

1701
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,320
“And you were fourteen when you ran away from your family.”

1702
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:48,640
“Well, I was weary, yu’ know, of havin’ elder brothers lay down
my law night and mawnin’.”

1703
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:51,320
“Yes, I know.

1704
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:55,080
So that your life has been your own for fifteen years.

1705
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:56,080
But it is not your own now.

1706
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:58,400
You have given it to a woman.”

1707
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:01,360
“Yes; I have given it to her.

1708
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:05,040
But my life’s not the whole of me.

1709
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:11,200
I’d give her twice my life⁠—fifty⁠—a thousand of ’em.

1710
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:22,600
But I can’t give her⁠—her nor anybody in heaven or earth⁠—I can’t
give my⁠—my⁠—we’ll never get at it, seh!

1711
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:24,040
There’s no good in words.

1712
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,560
Goodbye.”

1713
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:30,200
The Virginian wrung the bishop’s hand and left him.

1714
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:33,480
“God bless him!” said the bishop.

1715
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:34,960
“God bless him!”

1716
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:47,480
The Virginian unlocked the room in the hotel where he kept stored his tent, his blankets,
his packsaddles, and his many accoutrements for the bridal journey in the mountains.

1717
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:56,440
Out of the window he saw the mountains blue in shadow, but some
cottonwoods distant in the flat between were still bright green in the sun.

1718
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:02,080
From among his possessions he took quickly a pistol, wiping and
loading it.

1719
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:08,760
Then from its holster he removed the pistol which he had tried
and made sure of in the morning.

1720
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:19,320
This, according to his wont when going into a risk, he shoved
between his trousers and his shirt in front.

1721
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:26,880
The untried weapon he placed in the holster, letting it hang
visibly at his hip.

1722
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:33,600
He glanced out of the window again, and saw the mountains of
the same deep blue.

1723
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,360
But the cottonwoods were no longer in the sunlight.

1724
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:43,840
The shadow had come past them, nearer the town; for fifteen of
the forty minutes were gone.

1725
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,680
“The bishop is wrong,” he said.

1726
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,760
“There is no sense in telling her.”

1727
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:51,240
And he turned to the door, just as she came to it herself.

1728
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:54,040
“Oh!” she cried out at once, and rushed to him.

1729
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:56,160
He swore as he held her close.

1730
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:58,560
“The fools!” he said.

1731
02:30:58,560 --> 02:30:59,720
“The fools!”

1732
02:30:59,720 --> 02:31:04,760
“It has been so frightful waiting for you,” said she, leaning
her head against him.

1733
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:07,360
“Who had to tell you this?” he demanded.

1734
02:31:07,360 --> 02:31:10,800
“I don’t know. Somebody just came and said it.”

1735
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:13,160
“This is mean luck,” he murmured, patting her.

1736
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:14,440
“This is mean luck.”

1737
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:18,440
She went on: “I wanted to run out and find you; but I didn’t!


1738
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:20,200
I didn’t!

1739
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:28,320
I stayed quiet in my room till they said you had come back.”

1740
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:32,360
“It is mean luck. Mighty mean,” he repeated.

1741
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:34,640
“How could you be so long?” she asked.

1742
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:38,800
“Never mind, I’ve got you now. It is over.”

1743
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:41,160
Anger and sorrow filled him.

1744
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:44,760
“I might have known some fool would tell you,” he said.

1745
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:47,720
“It’s all over. Never mind.”

1746
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:52,600
Her arms tightened their hold of him.

1747
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:56,160
Then she let him go.

1748
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,280
“What shall we do?” she said.

1749
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,440
“What now?”

1750
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:01,440
“Now?” he answered.

1751
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,960
“Nothing now.”

1752
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:05,480
She looked at him without understanding.

1753
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:10,320
“I know it is a heap worse for you,” he pursued, speaking slowly.


1754
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:11,800
“I knew it would be.”

1755
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:14,200
“But it is over!” she exclaimed again.

1756
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:16,160
He did not understand her now.

1757
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:17,200
He kissed her.

1758
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:22,800
“Did you think it was over?” he said simply.

1759
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:30,080
“There is some waiting still before us. I wish you did not have
to wait alone. But it will not be long.”

1760
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:37,760
He was looking down, and did not see the happiness grow chilled
upon her face, and then fade into bewildered fear.

1761
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:39,960
“I did my best,” he went on.

1762
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:41,560
“I think I did.

1763
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:43,080
I know I tried.

1764
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:48,880
I let him say to me before them all what no man has ever said,
or ever will again.

1765
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:53,880
I kept thinking hard of you⁠—with all my might, or I reckon I’d
have killed him right there.

1766
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:56,760
And I gave him a show to change his mind.

1767
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:58,680
I gave it to him twice.

1768
02:32:58,680 --> 02:33:02,960
I spoke as quiet as I am speaking to you now.

1769
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,120
But he stood to it.

1770
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:10,160
And I expect he knows he went too far in the hearing of others
to go back on his threat.

1771
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:12,960
He will have to go on to the finish now.”

1772
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,560
“The finish?” she echoed, almost voiceless.

1773
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:19,760
“Yes,” he answered very gently.

1774
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:22,440
Her dilated eyes were fixed upon him.

1775
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:27,360
“But⁠—” she could scarce form utterance, “but you?”

1776
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:31,120
“I have got myself ready,” he said.

1777
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:35,520
“Did you think⁠—why, what did you think?”

1778
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:37,240
She recoiled a step.

1779
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:40,360
“What are you going⁠—” She put her two hands to her head.

1780
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:44,480
“Oh, God!” she almost shrieked, “you are going⁠—”

1781
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:51,880
He made a step, and would have put his arm round her, but she
backed against the wall, staring speechless at him.

1782
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:56,400
“I am not going to let him shoot me,” he said quietly.

1783
02:33:56,400 --> 02:34:00,280
“You mean⁠—you mean⁠—but you can come away!” she cried.

1784
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:01,720
“It’s not too late yet.

1785
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:04,160
You can take yourself out of his reach.

1786
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,440
Everybody knows that you are brave.

1787
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:07,920
What is he to you?

1788
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:10,320
You can leave him in this place.

1789
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:11,920
I’ll go with you anywhere.

1790
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:17,000
To any house, to the mountains, to anywhere away.

1791
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,200
We’ll leave this horrible place together and⁠—and⁠—oh, won’t
you listen to me?”

1792
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,640
She stretched her hands to him.

1793
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:24,560
“Won’t you listen?”

1794
02:34:24,560 --> 02:34:25,280
He took her hands.

1795
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:27,120
“I must stay here.”

1796
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:28,680
Her hands clung to his.

1797
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:31,040
“No, no, no.

1798
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,920
There’s something else.

1799
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:35,920
There’s something better than shedding blood in cold blood.

1800
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,880
Only think what it means!

1801
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:41,600
Only think of having to remember such a thing!

1802
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:44,000
Why, it’s what they hang people for!

1803
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,440
It’s murder!”

1804
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:46,520
He dropped her hands.

1805
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:49,200
“Don’t call it that name,” he said sternly.

1806
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:58,960
“When there was the choice!” she exclaimed, half to herself, like a person
stunned and speaking to the air. “To get ready for it when you have the choice!”

1807
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:01,880
“He did the choosing,” answered the Virginian.

1808
02:35:01,880 --> 02:35:06,640
“Listen to me. Are you listening?” he asked, for her gaze was
dull.

1809
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:07,840
She nodded.

1810
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:17,360
“I work hyeh. I belong hyeh. It’s my life. If folks came to think
I was a coward⁠—”

1811
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:19,440
“Who would think you were a coward?”

1812
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:20,160
“Everybody.

1813
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:26,520
My friends would be sorry and ashamed, and my enemies would walk
around saying they had always said so.

1814
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:30,080
I could not hold up my head again among enemies or friends.”

1815
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:31,240
“When it was explained⁠—”

1816
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:34,600
“There’d be nothing to explain. There’d just be the fact.”

1817
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:36,040
He was nearly angry.

1818
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:42,000
“There is a higher courage than fear of outside opinion,” said
the New England girl.

1819
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,600
Her Southern lover looked at her.

1820
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:49,280
“Cert’nly there is. That’s what I’m showing in going against
yours.”

1821
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:54,800
“But if you know that you are brave, and if I know that you are
brave, oh, my dear, my dear!

1822
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:57,280
what difference does the world make?

1823
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:00,360
How much higher courage to go your own course⁠—”

1824
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:03,120
“I am goin’ my own course,” he broke in.

1825
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:06,480
“Can’t yu’ see how it must be about a man?

1826
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:13,240
It’s not for their benefit, friends or enemies, that I have got
this thing to do.

1827
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:19,520
If any man happened to say I was a thief and I heard about it,
would I let him go on spreadin’ such a thing of me?

1828
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:22,800
Don’t I owe my own honesty something better than that?

1829
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:29,120
Would I sit down in a corner rubbin’ my honesty and whisperin’
to it, ‘There! there!

1830
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:30,520
I know you ain’t a thief?’

1831
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:32,600
No, seh; not a little bit!

1832
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:36,880
What men say about my nature is not just merely an outside thing.


1833
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:47,280
For the fact that I let ’em keep on sayin’ it is a proof I don’t value my
nature enough to shield it from their slander and give them their punishment.

1834
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:49,520
And that’s being a poor sort of a jay.”

1835
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:50,920
She had grown very white.

1836
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:54,240
“Can’t yu’ see how it must be about a man?” he repeated.

1837
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:59,800
“I cannot,” she answered, in a voice that scarcely seemed her
own.

1838
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:01,400
“If I ought to, I cannot.

1839
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:03,480
To shed blood in cold blood.

1840
02:37:03,480 --> 02:37:13,640
When I heard about that last fall⁠—about the killing of those
cattle thieves⁠—I kept saying to myself: ‘He had to do it.

1841
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:17,680
It was a public duty.’

1842
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:21,840
And lying sleepless I got used to Wyoming being different from
Vermont.

1843
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:32,160
But this⁠—” she gave a shudder⁠—“when I think of tomorrow, of you and
me, and of⁠—If you do this, there can be no tomorrow for you and me.”

1844
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:34,520
At these words he also turned white.

1845
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:38,440
“Do you mean⁠—” he asked, and could go no farther.

1846
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:41,840
Nor could she answer him, but turned her head away.

1847
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:44,920
“This would be the end?” he asked.

1848
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:47,600
Her head faintly moved to signify yes.

1849
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:51,160
He stood still, his hand shaking a little.

1850
02:37:51,160 --> 02:37:54,360
“Will you look at me and say that?” he murmured at length.

1851
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:55,480
She did not move.

1852
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:57,520
“Can you do it?” he said.

1853
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:01,400
His sweetness made her turn, but could not pierce her frozen
resolve.

1854
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:04,880
She gazed at him across the great distance of her despair.

1855
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:08,360
“Then it is really so?” he said.

1856
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:11,160
Her lips tried to form words, but failed.

1857
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:14,160
He looked out of the window, and saw nothing but shadow.

1858
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:18,000
The blue of the mountains was now become a deep purple.

1859
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,920
Suddenly his hand closed hard.

1860
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:22,640
“Goodbye, then,” he said.

1861
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:26,200
At that word she was at his feet, clutching him.

1862
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:28,040
“For my sake,” she begged him.

1863
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:29,160
“For my sake.”

1864
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:31,880
A tremble passed through his frame.

1865
02:38:31,880 --> 02:38:37,920
She felt his legs shake as she held them, and, looking up, she
saw that his eyes were closed with misery.

1866
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:41,520
Then he opened them, and in their steady look she read her answer.


1867
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:45,640
He unclasped her hands from holding him, and raised her to her
feet.

1868
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:48,960
“I have no right to kiss you any more,” he said.

1869
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:59,000
And then, before his desire could break him down from this, he
was gone, and she was alone.

1870
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,160
She did not fall, or totter, but stood motionless.

1871
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,360
And next⁠—it seemed a moment

1872
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:09,240
and it seemed eternity⁠—she heard in the distance a shot, and
then two shots.

1873
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:12,760
Out of the window she saw people beginning to run.

1874
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:18,880
At that she turned and fled to her room, and flung herself face
downward upon the floor.

1875
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:24,960
Trampas had departed into solitude from the saloon, leaving behind
him his ultimatum.

1876
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:33,080
His loud and public threat was town knowledge already, would
very likely be county knowledge tonight.

1877
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:46,440
Riders would take it with them to entertain distant cabins up the river and down the river;
and by dark the stage would go south with the news of it⁠—and the news of its outcome.

1878
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:49,520
For everything would be over by dark.

1879
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:54,640
After five years, here was the end coming⁠—coming before dark.


1880
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:58,480
Trampas had got up this morning with no such thought.

1881
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:04,320
It seemed very strange to look back upon the morning; it lay
so distant, so irrevocable.

1882
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:07,400
And he thought of how he had eaten his breakfast.

1883
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:09,160
How would he eat his supper?

1884
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:12,520
For supper would come afterward.

1885
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:15,840
Some people were eating theirs now, with nothing like this before
them.

1886
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:22,240
His heart ached and grew cold to think of them, easy and comfortable
with plates and cups of coffee.

1887
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:27,920
He looked at the mountains, and saw the sun above their ridges,
and the shadow coming from their feet.

1888
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:32,320
And there close behind him was the morning he could never go
back to.

1889
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:38,320
He could see it clearly; his thoughts reached out like arms to
touch it once more, and be in it again.

1890
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:44,680
The night that was coming he could not see, and his eyes and
his thoughts shrank from it.

1891
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:47,040
He had given his enemy until sundown.

1892
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:51,200
He could not trace the path which had led him to this.

1893
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:59,120
He remembered their first meeting⁠—five years back, in Medicine
Bow, and the words which at once began his hate.

1894
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:04,040
No, it was before any words; it was the encounter of their eyes.


1895
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:11,360
For out of the eyes of every stranger looks either a friend or
an enemy, waiting to be known.

1896
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:16,520
But how had five years of hate come to play him such a trick,
suddenly, today?

1897
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:24,160
Since last autumn he had meant sometime to get even with this man who seemed
to stand at every turn of his crookedness, and rob him of his spoils.

1898
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:30,920
But how had he come to choose such a way of getting even as this,
face to face?

1899
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:35,760
He knew many better ways; and now his own rash proclamation had
trapped him.

1900
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:43,840
His words were like doors shutting him in to perform his threat
to the letter, with witnesses at hand to see that he did so.

1901
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:47,000
Trampas looked at the sun and the shadow again.

1902
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,840
He had till sundown.

1903
02:41:48,840 --> 02:42:00,080
The heart inside him was turning it round in this opposite way: it was
to himself that in his rage he had given this lessening margin of grace.

1904
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:05,840
But he dared not leave town in all the world’s sight after all
the world had heard him.

1905
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:09,600
Even his friends would fall from him after such an act.

1906
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,000
Could he⁠—the thought actually came to

1907
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,480
him⁠—could he strike before the time set?

1908
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:16,960
But the thought was useless.

1909
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:28,120
Even if his friends could harbor him after such a deed, his enemies
would find him, and his life would be forfeit to a certainty.

1910
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:31,320
His own trap was closing upon him.

1911
02:42:31,320 --> 02:42:37,760
He came upon the main street, and saw some distance off the Virginian
standing in talk with the bishop.

1912
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:41,160
He slunk between two houses, and cursed both of them.

1913
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:47,200
The sight had been good for him, bringing some warmth of rage
back to his desperate heart.

1914
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,840
And he went into a place and drank some whiskey.

1915
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:55,880
“In your shoes,” said the barkeeper, “I’d be afraid to take so
much.”

1916
02:42:55,880 --> 02:43:05,000
But the nerves of Trampas were almost beyond the reach of intoxication,
and he swallowed some more, and went out again.

1917
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:11,080
Presently he fell in with some of his brothers in cattle stealing,
and walked along with them for a little.

1918
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:14,160
“Well, it will not be long now,” they said to him.

1919
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:16,280
And he had never heard words so desolate.

1920
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:19,520
“No,” he made out to say; “soon now.”

1921
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:24,280
Their cheerfulness seemed unearthly to him, and his heart almost
broke beneath it.

1922
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:28,160
“We’ll have one to your success,” they suggested.

1923
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:35,920
So with them he repaired to another place; and the sight of a man
leaning against the bar made him start so that they noticed him.

1924
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:40,880
Then he saw that the man was a stranger whom he had never laid
eyes on till now.

1925
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:44,280
“It looked like Shorty,” he said, and could have bitten his tongue
off.

1926
02:43:44,280 --> 02:43:47,520
“Shorty is quiet up in the Tetons,” said a friend.

1927
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:51,080
“You don’t want to be thinking about him. Here’s how!”

1928
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:53,320
Then they clapped him on the back and he left them.

1929
02:43:53,320 --> 02:44:00,560
He thought of his enemy and his hate, beating his rage like a
failing horse, and treading the courage of his drink.

1930
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:05,320
Across a space he saw Wiggin, walking with McLean and Scipio.


1931
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:10,000
They were watching the town to see that his friends made no foul
play.

1932
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,760
“We’re giving you a clear field,” said Wiggin.

1933
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:16,880
“This race will not be pulled,” said McLean.

1934
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:19,680
“Be with you at the finish,” said Scipio.

1935
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:20,960
And they passed on.

1936
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:26,880
They did not seem like real people to him.

1937
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:30,760
Trampas looked at the walls and windows of the houses.

1938
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:32,440
Were they real?

1939
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:34,840
Was he here, walking in this street?

1940
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,480
Something had changed.

1941
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:41,320
He looked everywhere, and feeling it everywhere, wondered what
this could be.

1942
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:48,080
Then he knew: it was the sun that had gone entirely behind the
mountains, and he drew out his pistol.

1943
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:53,920
The Virginian, for precaution, did not walk out of the front
door of the hotel.

1944
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:56,360
He went through back ways, and paused once.

1945
02:44:56,360 --> 02:45:03,160
Against his breast he felt the wedding ring where he had it suspended
by a chain from his neck.

1946
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:07,080
His hand went up to it, and he drew it out and looked at it.

1947
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:12,120
He took it off the chain, and his arm went back to hurl it from
him as far as he could.

1948
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:16,440
But he stopped and kissed it with one sob, and thrust it in his
pocket.

1949
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:18,640
Then he walked out into the open, watching.

1950
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:25,560
He saw men here and there, and they let him pass as before, without
speaking.

1951
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:28,960
He saw his three friends, and they said no word to him.

1952
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:37,720
But they turned and followed in his rear at a little distance,
because it was known that Shorty had been found shot from behind.

1953
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:48,680
The Virginian gained a position soon where no one could come at him except from in front; and the sight of
the mountains was almost more than he could endure, because it was there that he had been going tomorrow.

1954
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:53,080
“It is quite a while after sunset,” he heard himself say.

1955
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:59,480
A wind seemed to blow his sleeve off his arm, and he replied
to it, and saw Trampas pitch forward.

1956
02:45:59,480 --> 02:46:06,520
He saw Trampas raise his arm from the ground and fall again,
and lie there this time, still.

1957
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:14,000
A little smoke was rising from the pistol on the ground, and he
looked at his own, and saw the smoke flowing upward out of it.

1958
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,280
“I expect that’s all,” he said aloud.

1959
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:20,960
But as he came nearer Trampas, he covered him with his weapon.


1960
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:23,880
He stopped a moment, seeing the hand on the ground move.

1961
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:29,680
Two fingers twitched, and then ceased; for it was all.

1962
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:33,280
The Virginian stood looking down at Trampas.

1963
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:36,240
“Both of mine hit,” he said, once more aloud.

1964
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:44,560
“His must have gone mighty close to my arm. I told her it would
not be me.”

1965
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:48,720
He had scarcely noticed that he was being surrounded and congratulated.


1966
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:53,280
His hand was being shaken, and he saw it was Scipio in tears.


1967
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:59,560
Scipio’s joy made his heart like lead within him.

1968
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:03,440
He was near telling his friend everything, but he did not.

1969
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:07,760
“If anybody wants me about this,” he said, “I will be at the
hotel.”

1970
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:09,360
“Who’ll want you?” said Scipio.

1971
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:11,640
“Three of us saw his gun out.”

1972
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:13,080
And he vented his admiration.

1973
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:16,240
“You were that cool! That quick!”

1974
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:19,960
“I’ll see you boys again,” said the Virginian, heavily; and he
walked away.

1975
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:22,160
Scipio looked after him, astonished.

1976
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:27,080
“Yu’ might suppose he was in poor luck,” he said to McLean.

1977
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:32,080
The Virginian walked to the hotel, and stood on the threshold
of his sweetheart’s room.

1978
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:34,280
She had heard his step, and was upon her feet.

1979
02:47:34,280 --> 02:47:38,680
Her lips were parted, and her eyes fixed on him, nor

1980
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:40,040
did she move, or speak.

1981
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:42,320
“Yu’ have to know it,” said he.

1982
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:44,640
“I have killed Trampas.”

1983
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:48,640
“Oh, thank God!” she said; and he found her in his arms.

1984
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:54,040
Long they embraced without speaking, and what they whispered
then with their kisses, matters not.

1985
02:47:54,040 --> 02:48:14,760
Thus did her New England conscience battle to the end, and, in the end, capitulate to love. And the next day, with the bishop’s
blessing, and Mrs. Taylor’s broadest smile, and the ring on her finger, the Virginian departed with his bride into the mountains.

1986
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:15,880
CHAPTER XXXVI

1987
02:48:15,880 --> 02:48:16,960
At Dunbarton

1988
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:20,000
For their first bridal camp he chose an island.

1989
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:25,520
Long weeks beforehand he had thought of this place, and set his
heart upon it.

1990
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:31,560
Once established in his mind, the thought became a picture that
he saw waking and sleeping.

1991
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:38,040
He had stopped at the island many times alone, and in all
seasons; but at this special moment of the year he liked it best.

1992
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:56,480
Often he had added several needless miles to his journey that he might finish the day at this point, might catch the
trout for his supper beside a certain rock upon its edge, and fall asleep hearing the stream on either side of him.

1993
02:48:56,480 --> 02:49:04,000
Always for him the first signs that he had gained the true world
of the mountains began at the island.

1994
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:16,040
The first pine trees stood upon it; the first white columbine grew in their shade; and it seemed to
him that he always met here the first of the true mountain air⁠—the coolness and the new fragrance.

1995
02:49:16,040 --> 02:49:30,320
Below, there were only the cottonwoods, and the knolls and steep foothills with their sagebrush,
and the great warm air of the plains; here at this altitude came the definite change.

1996
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:38,160
Out of the lower country and its air he would urge his horse upward,
talking to him aloud, and promising fine pasture in a little while.

1997
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:58,120
Then, when at length he had ridden abreast of the island pines, he would ford to the sheltered circle of his campground, throw off the saddle and blanket from the
horse’s hot, wet back, throw his own clothes off, and, shouting, spring upon the horse bare, and with a rope for bridle, cross with him to the promised pasture.

1998
02:49:58,120 --> 02:50:04,320
Here there was a pause in the mountain steepness, a level space
of open, green with thick grass.

1999
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:19,920
Riding his horse to this, he would leap off him, and with the flat of his hand give him a blow that
cracked sharp in the stillness and sent the horse galloping and gambolling to his night’s freedom.

2000
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:32,200
And while the animal rolled in the grass, often his master would roll also, and stretch, and take
the grass in his two hands, and so draw his body along, limbering his muscles after a long ride.

2001
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:48,360
Then he would slide into the stream below his fishing place, where it was deep enough for swimming,
and cross back to his island, and dressing again, fit his rod together and begin his casting.

2002
02:50:48,360 --> 02:51:01,960
After the darkness had set in, there would follow the lying drowsily with his head upon his saddle, the
campfire sinking as he watched it, and sleep approaching to the murmur of the water on either side of him.

2003
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:11,720
So many visits to this island had he made, and counted so many hours of revery
spent in its haunting sweetness, that the spot had come to seem his own.

2004
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:24,480
It belonged to no man, for it was deep in the unsurveyed and virgin wilderness; neither had he ever
made his camp here with any man, nor shared with any the intimate delight which the place gave him.

2005
02:51:24,480 --> 02:51:37,000
Therefore for many weeks he had planned to bring her here after their wedding, upon
the day itself, and show her and share with her his pines and his fishing rock.

2006
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:46,320
He would bid her smell the first true breath of the mountains, would watch with her
the sinking campfire, and with her listen to the water as it flowed round the island.

2007
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:53,360
Until this wedding plan, it had by no means come home to him
how deep a hold upon him the island had taken.

2008
02:51:53,360 --> 02:52:06,000
He knew that he liked to go there, and go alone; but so little was it his way to scan himself, his mind, or his
feelings (unless some action called for it), that he first learned his love of the place through his love of her.

2009
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,080
But he told her nothing of it.

2010
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:18,960
After the thought of taking her there came to him, he kept his island as something to let
break upon her own eyes, lest by looking forward she should look for more than the reality.

2011
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:29,400
Hence, as they rode along, when the houses of the town were shrunk to dots behind
them, and they were nearing the gates of the foothills, she asked him questions.

2012
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:34,680
She hoped they would find a camp a long way from the town.

2013
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:37,520
She could ride as many miles as necessary.

2014
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:39,040
She was not tired.

2015
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:45,560
Should they not go on until they found a good place far enough
within the solitude?

2016
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:47,120
Had he fixed upon any?

2017
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:55,560
And at the nod and the silence that he gave her for reply, she knew
that he had thoughts and intentions which she must wait to learn.

2018
02:52:55,560 --> 02:53:00,400
They passed through the gates of the foothills, following the
stream up among them.

2019
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:06,280
The outstretching fences and the widely trodden dust were no
more.

2020
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:13,480
Now and then they rose again into view of the fields and houses
down in the plain below.

2021
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:22,760
But as the sum of the miles and hours grew, they were glad to see the
road less worn with travel, and the traces of men passing from sight.

2022
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:32,040
The ploughed and planted country, that quilt of many-colored harvests which
they had watched yesterday, lay in another world from this where they rode now.

2023
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:39,480
No hand but nature’s had sown these crops of yellow flowers,
these willow thickets and tall cottonwoods.

2024
02:53:39,480 --> 02:53:50,040
Somewhere in a passage of red rocks the last sign of wagon wheels
was lost, and after this the trail became a wild mountain trail.

2025
02:53:50,040 --> 02:54:04,800
But it was still the warm air of the plains, bearing the sagebrush odor and not the pine, that they
breathed; nor did any forest yet cloak the shapes of the tawny hills among which they were ascending.

2026
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:11,080
Twice the steepness loosened the pack ropes, and he jumped down
to tighten them, lest the horses should get sore backs.

2027
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:17,360
And twice the stream that they followed went into deep canyons,
so that for a while they parted from it.

2028
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:24,280
When they came back to its margin for the second time, he bade
her notice how its water had become at last wholly clear.

2029
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:29,600
To her it had seemed clear enough all along, even in the plain
above the town.

2030
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:37,280
But now she saw that it flowed lustrously with flashes; and she
knew the soil had changed to mountain soil.

2031
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:44,280
Lower down, the water had carried the slightest cloud of alkali,
and this had dulled the keen edge of its transparence.

2032
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:53,960
Full solitude was around them now, so that their words grew scarce,
and when they spoke it was with low voices.

2033
02:54:53,960 --> 02:55:01,320
They began to pass nooks and points favorable for camping, with
wood and water at hand, and pasture for the horses.

2034
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:17,560
More than once as they reached such places, she thought he must surely stop; but still he rode on in
advance of her (for the trail was narrow) until, when she was not thinking of it, he drew rein and pointed.

2035
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:19,360
“What?” she asked timidly.

2036
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:22,800
“The pines,” he answered.

2037
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:30,360
She looked, and saw the island, and the water folding it with
ripples and with smooth spaces.

2038
02:55:30,360 --> 02:55:42,240
The sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a light of deepening red gold, and the
shadow of the fishing rock lay over a little bay of quiet water and sandy shore.

2039
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:50,400
In this forerunning glow of the sunset, the pasture spread like
emerald; for the dry touch of summer had not yet come near it.

2040
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:57,240
He pointed upward to the high mountains which they had approached,
and showed her where the stream led into their first unfoldings.

2041
02:55:57,240 --> 02:56:01,400
“Tomorrow we shall be among them,” said he.

2042
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:05,000
“Then,” she murmured to him, “tonight is here?”

2043
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:14,400
He nodded for answer, and she gazed at the island and understood why he had
not stopped before; nothing they had passed had been so lovely as this place.

2044
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:30,760
There was room in the trail for them to go side by side; and side by side they rode to the ford and crossed, driving the
packhorses in front of them, until they came to the sheltered circle, and he helped her down where the soft pine needles lay.

2045
02:56:30,760 --> 02:56:39,000
They felt each other tremble, and for a moment she stood hiding
her head upon his breast.

2046
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:47,080
Then she looked round at the trees, and the shores, and the
flowing stream, and he heard her whispering how beautiful it was.

2047
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:51,200
“I am glad,” he said, still holding her.

2048
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:59,600
“This is how I have dreamed it would happen. Only it is better
than my dreams.”

2049
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:06,800
And when she pressed him in silence, he finished, “I have meant
we should see our first sundown here, and our first sunrise.”

2050
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:17,640
She wished to help him take the packs from their horses, to make the camp together
with him, to have for her share the building of the fire, and the cooking.

2051
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:29,200
She bade him remember his promise to her that he would teach her how to loop and draw
the pack-ropes, and the swing-ropes on the packsaddles, and how to pitch a tent.

2052
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:31,760
Why might not the first lesson be now?

2053
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:34,880
But he told her that this should be fulfilled later.

2054
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:37,640
This night he was to do all himself.

2055
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:41,720
And he sent her away until he should have camp ready for them.


2056
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:51,120
He bade her explore the island, or take her horse and ride over to the pasture,
where she could see the surrounding hills and the circle of seclusion that they made.

2057
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:54,840
“The whole world is far from here,” he said.

2058
02:57:54,840 --> 02:58:04,280
And so she obeyed him, and went away to wander about in their
hiding-place; nor was she to return, he told her, until he called her.

2059
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:07,320
Then at once, as soon as she was gone, he fell to.

2060
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:14,800
The packs and saddles came off the horses, which he turned loose
upon the pasture on the main land.

2061
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:17,880
The tent was unfolded first.

2062
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:25,280
He had long seen in his mind where it should go, and how its
white shape would look beneath the green of the encircling pines.

2063
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:33,600
The ground was level in the spot he had chosen, without stones
or roots, and matted with the fallen needles of the pines.

2064
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:43,560
If there should come any wind, or storm of rain, the branches were thick overhead,
and around them on three sides tall rocks and undergrowth made a barrier.

2065
02:58:43,560 --> 02:58:53,040
He cut the pegs for the tent, and the front pole, stretching and
tightening the rope, one end of it pegged down and one round a pine tree.

2066
02:58:53,040 --> 02:59:08,000
When the tightening rope had lifted the canvas to the proper height from the ground, he spread and pegged down the
sides and back, leaving the opening so that they could look out upon the fire and a piece of the stream beyond.

2067
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:18,920
He cut tufts of young pine and strewed them thickly for a soft floor
in the tent, and over them spread the buffalo hide and the blankets.

2068
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:22,720
At the head he placed the neat sack of her belongings.

2069
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:28,840
For his own he made a shelter with crossed poles and a sheet
of canvas beyond the first pines.

2070
02:59:28,840 --> 02:59:43,800
He built the fire where its smoke would float outward from the trees and the tent, and near it he
stood the cooking things and his provisions, and made this first supper ready in the twilight.

2071
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:48,800
He had brought much with him; but for ten minutes he fished,
catching trout enough.

2072
02:59:48,800 --> 02:59:56,080
When at length she came riding over the stream at his call, there
was nothing for her to do but sit and eat at the table he had laid.

2073
02:59:56,080 --> 03:00:01,440
They sat together, watching the last of the twilight and the
gentle oncoming of the dusk.

2074
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:10,160
The final afterglow of day left the sky, and through the purple
which followed it came slowly the first stars, bright and wide apart.

2075
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:19,880
They watched the spaces between them fill with more stars, while
near them the flames and embers of their fire grew brighter.

2076
03:00:19,880 --> 03:00:31,040
Then he sent her to the tent while he cleaned the dishes and
visited the horses to see that they did not stray from the pasture.

2077
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:35,320
Some while after the darkness was fully come, he rejoined her.


2078
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:50,920
All had been as he had seen it in his thoughts beforehand: the pines with the setting sun upon them,
the sinking campfire, and now the sound of the water as it flowed murmuring by the shores of the island.

2079
03:00:50,920 --> 03:00:56,320
The tent opened to the east, and from it they watched together
their first sunrise.

2080
03:00:56,320 --> 03:01:10,200
In his thoughts he had seen this morning beforehand also: the waking, the gentle sound of the water murmuring
ceaselessly, the growing day, the vision of the stream, the sense that the world was shut away far from them.

2081
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:13,880
So did it all happen, except that he whispered to her again:⁠—


2082
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:15,200
“Better than my dreams.”

2083
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:28,120
They saw the sunlight begin upon a hilltop; and presently came the sun itself,
and lakes of warmth flowed into the air, slowly filling the green solitude.

2084
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:33,400
Along the island shores the ripples caught flashes from the sun.


2085
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:39,880
“I am going into the stream,” he said to her; and rising, he
left her in the tent.

2086
03:01:39,880 --> 03:01:47,280
This was his side of the island, he had told her last night;
the other was hers, where he had made a place for her to bathe.

2087
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:53,880
When he was gone, she found it, walking through the trees and
rocks to the water’s edge.

2088
03:01:53,880 --> 03:02:00,000
And so, with the island between them, the two bathed in the cold
stream.

2089
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:03,840
When he came back, he found her already busy at their camp.

2090
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:12,080
The blue smoke of the fire was floating out from the trees, loitering
undispersed in the quiet air, and she was getting their breakfast.

2091
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:19,800
She had been able to forestall him because he had delayed long
at his dressing, not willing to return to her unshaven.

2092
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:26,840
She looked at his eyes that were clear as the water he had leaped
into, and at his soft silk neckerchief, knotted with care.

2093
03:02:26,840 --> 03:02:33,560
“Do not let us ever go away from here!” she cried, and ran to
him as he came.

2094
03:02:33,560 --> 03:02:42,480
They sat long together at breakfast, breathing the morning breath of
the earth that was fragrant with woodland moisture and with the pines.

2095
03:02:42,480 --> 03:02:45,760
After the meal he could not prevent her helping him make everything
clean.

2096
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:54,000
Then, by all customs of mountain journeys, it was time they should
break camp and be moving before the heat of the day.

2097
03:02:54,000 --> 03:03:00,760
But first, they delayed for no reason, save that in these hours
they so loved to do nothing.

2098
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:09,760
And next, when with some energy he got upon his feet and declared
he must go and drive the horses in, she asked, Why?

2099
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:14,880
Would it not be well for him to fish here, that they might be
sure of trout at their nooning?

2100
03:03:14,880 --> 03:03:23,440
And though he knew that where they should stop for noon, trout
would be as sure as here, he took this chance for more delay.

2101
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:27,440
She went with him to his fishing rock, and sat watching him.

2102
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:31,280
The rock was tall, higher than his head when he stood.

2103
03:03:31,280 --> 03:03:37,920
It jutted out halfway across the stream, and the water flowed
round it in quick foam, and fell into a pool.

2104
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:45,360
He caught several fish; but the sun was getting high, and after
a time it was plain the fish had ceased to rise.

2105
03:03:45,360 --> 03:03:52,080
Yet still he stood casting in silence, while she sat by and watched
him.

2106
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:57,080
Across the stream, the horses wandered or lay down in their pasture.


2107
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:02,000
At length he said with half a sigh that perhaps they ought to
go.

2108
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,040
“Ought?” she repeated softly.

2109
03:04:04,040 --> 03:04:07,200
“If we are to get anywhere today,” he answered.

2110
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:09,600
“Need we get anywhere?” she asked.

2111
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:12,360
Her question sent delight through him like a flood.

2112
03:04:12,360 --> 03:04:16,120
“Then you do not want to move camp today?” said he.

2113
03:04:16,120 --> 03:04:17,240
She shook her head.

2114
03:04:17,240 --> 03:04:22,800
At this he laid down his rod and came and sat by her.

2115
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:27,560
“I am very glad we shall not go till tomorrow,” he murmured.

2116
03:04:27,560 --> 03:04:29,080
“Not tomorrow,” she said.

2117
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:35,120
“Nor next day. Nor any day until we must.”

2118
03:04:35,120 --> 03:04:41,920
And she stretched her hands out to the island and the stream
exclaiming, “Nothing can surpass this!”

2119
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:43,000
He took her in his arms.

2120
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,800
“You feel about it the way I do,” he almost whispered.

2121
03:04:45,800 --> 03:04:50,280
“I could not have hoped there’d be two of us to care so much.”


2122
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:59,600
Presently, while they remained without speaking by the pool,
came a little wild animal swimming round the rock from above.

2123
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:04,040
It had not seen them, nor suspected their presence.

2124
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:14,840
They held themselves still, watching its alert head cross through the waves
quickly and come down through the pool, and so swim to the other side.

2125
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:27,520
There it came out on a small stretch of sand, turned its gray head and its pointed black nose
this way and that, never seeing them, and then rolled upon its back in the warm dry sand.

2126
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:33,640
After a minute of rolling, it got on its feet again, shook its
fur, and trotted away.

2127
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:37,600
Then the bridegroom husband opened his shy heart deep down.

2128
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:41,000
“I am like that fellow,” he said dreamily.

2129
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,040
“I have often done the same.”

2130
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:50,320
And stretching slowly his arms and legs, he lay full length upon
his back, letting his head rest upon her.

2131
03:05:50,320 --> 03:05:55,120
“If I could talk his animal language, I could talk to him,” he
pursued.

2132
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:59,240
“And he would say to me: ‘Come and roll on the sands.

2133
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:00,960
Where’s the use of fretting?

2134
03:06:00,960 --> 03:06:02,600
What’s the gain in being a man?

2135
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:04,720
Come roll on the sands with me.’

2136
03:06:04,720 --> 03:06:06,200
That’s what he would say.”

2137
03:06:06,200 --> 03:06:07,080
The Virginian paused.

2138
03:06:07,080 --> 03:06:10,560
“But,” he continued, “the trouble is, I am responsible.

2139
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:14,240
If that could only be forgot forever by you and me!”

2140
03:06:14,240 --> 03:06:17,040
Again he paused and went on, always dreamily.

2141
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:28,680
“Often when I have camped here, it has made me want to become the
ground, become the water, become the trees, mix with the whole thing.

2142
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:30,200
Not know myself from it.

2143
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:31,960
Never unmix again.

2144
03:06:31,960 --> 03:06:39,760
Why is that?” he demanded, looking at her.

2145
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:49,560
“What is it? You don’t know, nor I don’t. I wonder would everybody
feel that way here?”

2146
03:06:49,560 --> 03:06:51,960
“I think not everybody,” she answered.

2147
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:58,200
“No; none except the ones who understand things they can’t put
words to. But you did!”

2148
03:06:58,200 --> 03:07:01,200
He put up a hand and touched her softly.

2149
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:03,640
“You understood about this place.

2150
03:07:03,640 --> 03:07:09,400
And that’s what makes it⁠—makes you and me as we are now⁠—better
than my dreams.

2151
03:07:09,400 --> 03:07:11,840
And my dreams were pretty good.”

2152
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:18,000
He sighed with supreme quiet and happiness, and seemed to stretch
his length closer to the earth.

2153
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:24,320
And so he lay, and talked to her as he had never talked to anyone,
not even to himself.

2154
03:07:24,320 --> 03:07:33,560
Thus she learned secrets of his heart new to her: his visits here,
what they were to him, and why he had chosen it for their bridal camp.

2155
03:07:33,560 --> 03:07:41,400
“What I did not know at all,” he said, “was the way a man can be
pining for⁠—for this⁠—and never guess what is the matter with him.”

2156
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:50,120
When he had finished talking, still he lay extended and serene; and she looked
down at him and the wonderful change that had come over him, like a sunrise.

2157
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:54,600
Was this dreamy boy the man of two days ago?

2158
03:07:54,600 --> 03:08:04,360
It seemed a distance immeasurable; yet it was two days only since that
wedding eve when she had shrunk from him as he stood fierce and implacable.

2159
03:08:04,360 --> 03:08:08,360
She could look back at that dark hour now, although she could
not speak of it.

2160
03:08:08,360 --> 03:08:12,440
She had seen destruction like sharp steel glittering in his eyes.


2161
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:14,880
Were these the same eyes?

2162
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:26,200
Was this youth with his black head of hair in her lap the creature
with whom men did not trifle, whose hand knew how to deal death?

2163
03:08:26,200 --> 03:08:30,080
Where had the man melted away to in this boy?

2164
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:40,320
For as she looked at him, he might have been no older than nineteen
today.

2165
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:47,840
Not even at their first meeting⁠—that night when his freakish
spirit was uppermost⁠—had he looked so young.

2166
03:08:47,840 --> 03:08:53,320
This change their hours upon the island had wrought, filling
his face with innocence.

2167
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:58,640
By and by they made their nooning.

2168
03:08:58,640 --> 03:09:04,960
In the afternoon she would have explored the nearer woods with
him, or walked up the stream.

2169
03:09:04,960 --> 03:09:10,640
But since this was to be their camp during several days, he made
it more complete.

2170
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:24,320
He fashioned a rough bench and a table; around their tent he built a tall windbreak for better
shelter in case of storm; and for the fire he gathered and cut much wood, and piled it up.

2171
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:31,680
So they were provided for, and so for six days and nights they
stayed, finding no day or night long enough.

2172
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:37,960
Once his hedge of boughs did them good service, for they had
an afternoon of furious storm.

2173
03:09:37,960 --> 03:09:48,360
The wind rocked the pines and ransacked the island, the sun went out,
the black clouds rattled, and white bolts of lightning fell close by.

2174
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:52,640
The shower broke through the pine branches and poured upon the
tent.

2175
03:09:52,640 --> 03:10:01,760
But he had removed everything inside from where it could touch the canvas and so lead
the water through, and the rain ran off into the ditch he had dug round the tent.

2176
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:09,880
While they sat within, looking out upon the bounding floods and
the white lightning, she saw him glance at her apprehensively, and

2177
03:10:09,880 --> 03:10:11,440
at once she answered his glance.

2178
03:10:11,440 --> 03:10:13,600
“I am not afraid,” she said.

2179
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:17,440
“If a flame should consume us together now, what would it matter?”


2180
03:10:17,440 --> 03:10:24,440
And so they sat watching the storm till it was over, he with
his face changed by her to a boy’s, and she leavened with him.

2181
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:31,520
When at last they were compelled to leave the island, or see
no more of the mountains, it was not a final parting.

2182
03:10:31,520 --> 03:10:34,760
They would come back for the last night before their journey
ended.

2183
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:43,320
Furthermore, they promised each other like two children to come here every year upon
their wedding day, and like two children they believed that this would be possible.

2184
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:58,520
But in after years they did come, more than once, to keep their wedding day upon the
island, and upon each new visit were able to say to each other, “Better than our dreams.”

2185
03:10:58,520 --> 03:11:16,160
For thirty days by the light of the sun and the campfire light they saw no faces except their own; and when they
were silent it was all stillness, unless the wind passed among the pines, or some flowing water was near them.

2186
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:32,160
Sometimes at evening they came upon elk, or black-tailed deer, feeding out in the high parks of the mountains;
and once from the edge of some concealing timber he showed her a bear, sitting with an old log lifted in its paws.

2187
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:37,240
She forbade him to kill the bear, or any creature that they did
not require.

2188
03:11:37,240 --> 03:11:58,360
He took her upward by trail and canyon, through the unfooted woods and along dwindling streams to their headwaters, lakes lying near the
summit of the range, full of trout, with meadows of long grass and a thousand flowers, and above these the pinnacles of rock and snow.

2189
03:11:58,360 --> 03:12:10,800
They made their camps in many places, delaying several days here, and one night
there, exploring the high solitudes together, and sinking deep in their romance.

2190
03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:23,040
Sometimes when he was at work with their horses, or intent on casting his brown hackle
for a fish, she would watch him with eyes that were fuller of love than of understanding.

2191
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:28,520
Perhaps she never came wholly to understand him; but in her complete
love for him she found enough.

2192
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:31,080
He loved her with his whole man’s power.

2193
03:12:31,080 --> 03:12:37,080
She had listened to him tell her in words of transport, “I could
enjoy dying”; yet she loved him more than that.

2194
03:12:37,080 --> 03:12:42,640
He had come to her from a smoking pistol, able to bid her farewell⁠—and
she could not let him go.

2195
03:12:42,640 --> 03:12:49,640
At the last white-hot edge of ordeal, it was she who renounced,
and he who had his way.

2196
03:12:49,640 --> 03:13:06,160
Nevertheless she found much more than enough, in spite of the sigh that now and again breathed
through her happiness when she would watch him with eyes fuller of love than of understanding.

2197
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:18,360
They could not speak of that grim wedding eve for a long while after; but the
mountains brought them together upon all else in the world and their own lives.

2198
03:13:18,360 --> 03:13:27,240
At the end they loved each other doubly more than at the beginning,
because of these added confidences which they exchanged and shared.

2199
03:13:27,240 --> 03:13:39,320
It was a new bliss to her to know a man’s talk and thoughts, to be given so much of him; and
to him it was a bliss still greater to melt from that reserve his lonely life had bred in him.

2200
03:13:39,320 --> 03:13:44,760
He never would have guessed so much had been stored away in him,
unexpressed till now.

2201
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:53,080
They did not want to go to Vermont and leave these mountains, but
the day came when they had to turn their backs upon their dream.

2202
03:13:53,080 --> 03:14:02,240
So they came out into the plains once more, well established in their
familiarity, with only the journey still lying between themselves and Bennington.

2203
03:14:02,240 --> 03:14:04,840
“If you could,” she said, laughing.

2204
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:07,720
“If only you could ride home like this.”

2205
03:14:07,720 --> 03:14:10,400
“With Monte and my six-shooter?” he asked.

2206
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:11,280
“To your mother?”

2207
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:14,960
“I don’t think mother could resist the way you look on a horse.”


2208
03:14:14,960 --> 03:14:19,440
But he said, “It’s this way she’s fearing I will come.”

2209
03:14:19,440 --> 03:14:22,720
“I have made one discovery,” she said.

2210
03:14:22,720 --> 03:14:25,880
“You are fonder of good clothes than I am.”

2211
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:26,480
He grinned.

2212
03:14:26,480 --> 03:14:27,840
“I cert’nly like ’em.

2213
03:14:27,840 --> 03:14:35,120
But don’t tell my friends.

2214
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:39,800
They would say it was marriage.

2215
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:48,520
When you see what I have got for Bennington’s special benefit,
you⁠—why, you’ll just trust your husband more than ever.”

2216
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:49,200
She undoubtedly did.

2217
03:14:49,200 --> 03:14:54,720
After he had put on one particular suit, she arose and kissed
him where he stood in it.

2218
03:14:54,720 --> 03:14:57,120
“Bennington will be sorrowful,” he said.

2219
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:03,200
“No wild-west show, after all. And no ready-made guy, either.”


2220
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:05,880
And he looked at himself in the glass with unbidden pleasure.


2221
03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:08,480
“How did you choose that?” she asked.

2222
03:15:08,480 --> 03:15:13,240
“How did you know that homespun was exactly the thing for you?”


2223
03:15:13,240 --> 03:15:15,600
“Why, I have been noticing.

2224
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:20,320
I used to despise an Eastern man because his clothes were not
Western.

2225
03:15:20,320 --> 03:15:28,680
I was very young then, or maybe not so very young, as very⁠—as
what you saw I was when you first came to Bear Creek.

2226
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:30,520
A Western man is a good thing.

2227
03:15:30,520 --> 03:15:33,640
And he generally knows that.

2228
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:36,080
But he has a heap to learn.

2229
03:15:36,080 --> 03:15:37,840
And he generally don’t know that.

2230
03:15:37,840 --> 03:15:41,040
So I took to watching the Judge’s Eastern visitors.

2231
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:59,560
There was that Mr. Ogden especially, from New Yawk⁠—the gentleman that was
there the time when I had to sit up all night with the missionary, yu’ know.

2232
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:01,640
His clothes pleased me best of all.

2233
03:16:01,640 --> 03:16:04,200
Fit him so well, and nothing flash.

2234
03:16:04,200 --> 03:16:09,280
I got my ideas, and when I knew I was going to marry you, I sent
my measure East⁠—and

2235
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:12,120
I and the tailor are old enemies now.”

2236
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:14,720
Bennington probably was disappointed.

2237
03:16:14,720 --> 03:16:25,280
To see get out of the train merely a tall man with a usual straw hat, and Scotch
homespun suit of a rather better cut than most in Bennington⁠—this was dull.

2238
03:16:25,280 --> 03:16:30,280
And his conversation⁠—when he indulged in any⁠—seemed fit to
come inside the house.

2239
03:16:30,280 --> 03:16:41,320
Mrs. Flynt took her revenge by sowing broadcast her thankfulness
that poor Sam Bannett had been Molly’s rejected suitor.

2240
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:44,480
He had done so much better for himself.

2241
03:16:44,480 --> 03:16:55,560
Sam had married a rich Miss Van Scootzer, of the second families of Troy; and with their
combined riches this happy couple still inhabit the most expensive residence in Hoosic Falls.

2242
03:16:55,560 --> 03:17:03,120
But most of Bennington soon began to say that Molly’s cowboy
could be invited anywhere and hold his own.

2243
03:17:03,120 --> 03:17:08,440
The time came when they ceased to speak of him as a cowboy, and
declared that she had shown remarkable sense.

2244
03:17:08,440 --> 03:17:10,520
But this was not quite yet.

2245
03:17:10,520 --> 03:17:16,840
Did this bride and groom enjoy their visit to her family? Well⁠—well,
they did their best.

2246
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:20,360
Everybody did their best, even Sarah Bell.

2247
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:27,000
She said that she found nothing to object to in the Virginian;
she told Molly so.

2248
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,520
Her husband Sam did better than that.

2249
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:32,560
He told Molly he considered that she was in luck.

2250
03:17:32,560 --> 03:17:44,840
And poor Mrs. Wood, sitting on the sofa, conversed scrupulously and timidly with her
novel son-in-law, and said to Molly that she was astonished to find him so gentle.

2251
03:17:44,840 --> 03:17:48,760
And he was undoubtedly fine-looking; yes, very handsome.

2252
03:17:48,760 --> 03:17:52,200
She believed that she would grow to like the Southern accent.


2253
03:17:52,200 --> 03:17:54,160
Oh, yes!

2254
03:17:54,160 --> 03:18:08,000
Everybody did their best; and, dear reader, if ever it has been your earthly portion to live with a number of
people who were all doing their best, you do not need me to tell you what a heavenly atmosphere this creates.

2255
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:13,360
And then the bride and groom went to see the old great-aunt over
at Dunbarton.

2256
03:18:13,360 --> 03:18:25,680
Their first arrival, the one at Bennington, had been thus: Sam Bell had met them at the train,
and Mrs. Wood, waiting in her parlor, had embraced her daughter and received her son-in-law.

2257
03:18:25,680 --> 03:18:33,560
Among them they had managed to make the occasion as completely
mournful as any family party can be, with the window blinds up.

2258
03:18:33,560 --> 03:18:40,600
“And with you present, my dear,” said Sam Bell to Sarah, “the
absence of a coffin was not felt.”

2259
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:43,440
But at Dunbarton the affair went off differently.

2260
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:47,760
The heart of the ancient lady had taught her better things.

2261
03:18:47,760 --> 03:18:55,360
From Bennington to Dunbarton is the good part of a day’s journey,
and they drove up to the gate in the afternoon.

2262
03:18:55,360 --> 03:19:08,160
The great-aunt was in her garden, picking some August flowers, and she called as
the carriage stopped, “Bring my nephew here, my dear, before you go into the house.”

2263
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:13,600
At this, Molly, stepping out of the carriage, squeezed her husband’s
hand.

2264
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:17,120
“I knew that she would be lovely,” she whispered to him.

2265
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:20,880
And then she ran to her aunt’s arms, and let him follow.

2266
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:23,360
He came slowly, hat in hand.

2267
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:30,080
The old lady advanced to meet him, trembling a little, and holding
out her hand to him.

2268
03:19:30,080 --> 03:19:32,280
“Welcome, nephew,” she said.

2269
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:39,160
“What a tall fellow you are, to be sure. Stand off, sir, and
let me look at you.”

2270
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:43,000
The Virginian obeyed, blushing from his black hair to his collar.


2271
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:48,040
Then his new relative turned to her niece, and gave her a flower.


2272
03:19:48,040 --> 03:19:51,560
“Put this in his coat, my dear,” she said.

2273
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:55,280
“And I think I understand why you wanted to marry him.”

2274
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:58,960
After this the maid came and showed them to their rooms.

2275
03:19:58,960 --> 03:20:08,160
Left alone in her garden, the great-aunt sank on a bench and
sat there for some time; for emotion had made her very weak.

2276
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:17,360
Upstairs, Molly, sitting on the Virginian’s knee, put the flower
in his coat, and then laid her head upon his shoulder.

2277
03:20:17,360 --> 03:20:21,440
“I didn’t know old ladies could be that way,” he said.

2278
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:23,000
“D’ yu’ reckon there are many?”

2279
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:24,960
“Oh, I don’t know,” said the girl.

2280
03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:26,200
“I’m so happy!”

2281
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:31,200
Now at tea, and during the evening, the great-aunt carried out
her plans still further.

2282
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:36,240
At first she did the chief part of the talking herself.

2283
03:20:36,240 --> 03:20:44,120
Nor did she ask questions about Wyoming too soon.

2284
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:49,680
She reached that in her own way, and found out the one thing
that she desired to know.

2285
03:20:49,680 --> 03:20:52,360
It was through General Stark that she led up to it.

2286
03:20:52,360 --> 03:20:55,640
“There he is,” she said, showing the family portrait.

2287
03:20:55,640 --> 03:21:00,040
“And a rough time he must have had of it now and then.

2288
03:21:00,040 --> 03:21:04,160
New Hampshire was full of fine young men in those days.

2289
03:21:04,160 --> 03:21:09,360
But nowadays most of them have gone away to seek their fortunes
in the West.

2290
03:21:09,360 --> 03:21:12,320
Do they find them, I wonder?”

2291
03:21:12,320 --> 03:21:14,960
“Yes, ma’am. All the good ones do.”

2292
03:21:14,960 --> 03:21:18,480
“But you cannot all be⁠—what is the name?⁠—Cattle Kings.”

2293
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:23,760
“That’s having its day, ma’am, right now. And we are getting
ready for the change⁠—some of us are.”

2294
03:21:23,760 --> 03:21:28,080
“And what may be the change, and when is it to come?”

2295
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:31,760
“When the natural pasture is eaten off,” he explained.

2296
03:21:31,760 --> 03:21:33,800
“I have seen that coming a long while.

2297
03:21:33,800 --> 03:21:38,840
And if the thieves are going to make us drive our stock away,
we’ll drive it.

2298
03:21:38,840 --> 03:21:44,800
If they don’t, we’ll have big pastures fenced, and hay and shelter
ready for winter.

2299
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:49,000
What we’ll spend in improvements, we’ll more than save in wages.


2300
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:52,040
I am well fixed for the new conditions.

2301
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:56,480
And then, when I took up my land, I chose a place where there
is coal.

2302
03:21:56,480 --> 03:21:59,800
It will not be long before the new railroad needs that.”

2303
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:09,600
Thus the old lady learned more of her niece’s husband in one evening than
the Bennington family had ascertained during his whole sojourn with them.

2304
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:14,960
For by touching upon Wyoming and its future, she roused him to
talk.

2305
03:22:14,960 --> 03:22:28,280
He found her mind alive to Western questions: irrigation, the Indians, the forests;
and so he expanded, revealing to her his wide observation and his shrewd intelligence.

2306
03:22:28,280 --> 03:22:29,880
He forgot entirely to be shy.

2307
03:22:29,880 --> 03:22:33,600
She sent Molly to bed, and kept him talking for an hour.

2308
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:44,240
Then she showed him old things that she was proud of, “because,”
she said, “we, too, had something to do with making our country.

2309
03:22:44,240 --> 03:22:48,280
And now go to Molly, or you’ll both think me a tiresome old lady.”


2310
03:22:48,280 --> 03:22:56,600
“I think⁠—” he began, but was not quite equal to expressing what
he thought, and suddenly his shyness flooded him again.

2311
03:22:56,600 --> 03:23:01,920
“In that case, nephew,” said she, “I’m afraid you’ll have to
kiss me good night.”

2312
03:23:01,920 --> 03:23:09,920
And so she dismissed him to his wife, and to happiness greater than either
of them had known since they had left the mountains and come to the East.

2313
03:23:09,920 --> 03:23:12,440
“He’ll do,” she said to herself, nodding.

2314
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:19,320
Their visit to Dunbarton was all happiness and reparation for
the doleful days at Bennington.

2315
03:23:19,320 --> 03:23:29,880
The old lady gave much comfort and advice to her niece in private, and when they
came to leave, she stood at the front door holding both their hands a moment.

2316
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:33,000
“God bless you, my dears,” she told them.

2317
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:36,240
“And when you come next time, I’ll have the nursery ready.”

2318
03:23:36,240 --> 03:23:44,160
And so it happened that before she left this world, the great-aunt
was able to hold in her arms the first of their many children.

2319
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:47,880
Judge Henry at Sunk Creek had his wedding present ready.

2320
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:54,360
His growing affairs in Wyoming needed his presence in many places
distant from his ranch, and he made the Virginian his partner.

2321
03:23:54,360 --> 03:24:03,240
When the thieves prevailed at length, as they did, forcing cattle owners to
leave the country or be ruined, the Virginian had forestalled this crash.

2322
03:24:03,240 --> 03:24:06,440
The herds were driven away to Montana.

2323
03:24:06,440 --> 03:24:19,760
Then, in 1889, came the cattle war, when, after putting their men in office, and
coming to own some of the newspapers, the thieves brought ruin on themselves as well.

2324
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:23,680
For in a broken country there is nothing left to steal.

2325
03:24:23,680 --> 03:24:29,040
But the railroad came, and built a branch to that land of the
Virginian’s where the coal was.

2326
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:40,880
By that time he was an important man, with a strong grip on many various
enterprises, and able to give his wife all and more than she asked or desired.

2327
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:49,760
Sometimes she missed the Bear Creek days, when she and he had ridden
together, and sometimes she declared that his work would kill him.

2328
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:51,800
But it does not seem to have done so.

2329
03:24:51,800 --> 03:25:02,080
Their eldest boy rides the horse Monte; and, strictly between
ourselves, I think his father is going to live a long while.
