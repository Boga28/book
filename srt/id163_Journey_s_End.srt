1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,680
Tom Smith was a nice young man.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,080
He wanted a job, but he couldn't find one.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,190
Many people wanted to work, and there weren't
many jobs.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:25,690
Tom felt sad because he never had money for
clothes or the cinema.

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,699
When he was younger, Tom wanted to be a footballer.

6
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,530
He was good at football, and at tennis, too.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,420
He was good at every sport.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,280
But there were other, better players.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,880
Now Tom had a new idea.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,809
He thought, 'Perhaps I can find a job in a
sports shop.

11
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,579
I'll be happy then and I'll have money.'

12
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,100
But it was only an idea.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,870
It never happened.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,620
He tried hard to find a job.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:13,330
He looked in the newspapers every day and
he wrote letters for jobs - a lot of letters.

16
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,000
But he never found a job.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,630
One day he saw something in the newspaper
about a fair in the park near his house.

18
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,680
'That will be interesting,' he thought.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
'It's next Saturday.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
I think I'll go.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,490
Yes, I'll go.

22
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,709
I'm not doing anything this weekend, and it
won't cost much.'

23
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,970
On Saturday Tom walked to the park and bought
a ticket for the fair.

24
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,580
It was a warm summer day The sky was blue,
and the park was very pretty.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,770
There were a lot of flowers - blue, yellow
and red.

26
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,959
Tom felt happy when he saw them.

27
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,990
The fair was good, too.

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,730
There were a lot of people there, and many
different games.

29
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,470
Tom played some games.

30
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,930
He won a box of fruit and a book about sport.

31
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,900
Then he bought an ice-cream because he was
hot and thirsty.

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,730
'I'm having a good day!' he thought.

33
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,450
He sat down and ate his ice-cream.

34
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,930
'Now, what shall I do next?'

35
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,620
Suddenly he saw, in large letters:

36
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,819
MADAM ZELDA KNOWS THE FUTURE

37
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,290
Do you want to know about your future?

38
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,909
Come in and talk to Madame Zelda.

39
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,390
Tom Smith thought very hard.

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,959
'Shall I go in?' he thought.

41
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
'Why not?

42
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,849
I'm not afraid of the future.

43
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,040
Perhaps it will be interesting.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,939
Yes, I'll go in and have a conversation with
Madame Zelda.'

45
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:19,939
So he went in.

46
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,950
It was very dark inside.

47
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,590
An old woman with grey hair and a kind face
smiled at Tom.

48
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,709
'Hello, young man!'

49
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:33,709
she said.

50
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:39,749
'Sit down and I will tell you about your future.'

51
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,829
Tom sat down.

52
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,389
The old woman looked at some cards on the
table.

53
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,540
'Take three cards,' she said.

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,719
Tom took the cards and gave them to her.

55
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,189
The woman looked at the cards for a long time.

56
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,560
Then she spoke.

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,069
She didn't smile now.

58
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,599
'Listen!'

59
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,599
she said.

60
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,359
'I have to tell you something very important.

61
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,959
Do not go anywhere next Friday.

62
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,430
Make a journey next Friday, and you will never
arrive!

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,960
Something will happen on the way.

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,020
Don't forget now.

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,970
I can tell you nothing more.

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,840
Be careful, young man.'

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,919
Tom left.

68
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,710
The sun was very hot on his face.

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,460
He had no more money, and he wanted to go
home.

70
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,780
'I'm not afraid,' he thought.

71
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,720
'I don't go on journeys.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,979
I won't go anywhere next Friday.

73
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,610
Every day is the same to me.

74
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,750
I haven't got a job, so I don't go anywhere.'

75
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,960
But on Thursday Tom had a letter.

76
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,210
It was an answer to one of his letters!

77
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:13,210
There was a job in a town thirty kilometers
away.

78
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,150
It was in a sports shop.

79
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,060
The boss wanted to meet Tom the next day.

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,030
Tom felt very happy.

81
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,669
'I'll have to take a train there,' he thought.

82
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,280
'I can't walk thirty kilometers.'

83
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,060
Suddenly he remembered the old woman at the
fair, and he felt afraid.

84
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,250
'Do not go anywhere next Friday,' she told
him.

85
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,220
'But what can I do?'

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Tom thought sadly.

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,900
'I can't lose this job.

88
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,010
It's too important to me.

89
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,760
I'll have to take the train tomorrow.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,650
And what can an old woman know about the future?

91
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,380
Nothing!'

92
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,090
But he wasn't very happy about it.

93
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,729
And he didn't sleep well that night.

94
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:15,069
The next day was Friday, and Tom went to the
station.

95
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,169
He bought a ticket at the ticket office.

96
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,360
The train arrived, and he climbed on it.

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,150
An old man sat down next to Tom.

98
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,790
His face was intelligent under his white hair.

99
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:36,220
He had a bad leg, and Tom felt sorry for him.

100
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,090
The train left the station and went through
the country.

101
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:47,690
A waiter came round with some food and the
old man bought a sandwich.

102
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,910
Then he smiled at Tom and said, 'Are you thirsty?

103
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,419
I've got some tea with me.

104
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,770
Would you like some?'

105
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,930
He took out a cup and gave Tom some tea.

106
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,760
'He's a kind man!'

107
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Tom thought.

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,500
'I really like him.'

109
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,099
He smiled at the old man and said, 'Thank
you.

110
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,990
I'm Tom Smith.

111
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,530
Are you going a long way?'

112
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,270
But the old man couldn't answer.

113
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,610
Suddenly there was a very loud noise and the
train stopped.

114
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,439
What was wrong?

115
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,250
The people on the train were afraid.

116
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,240
They all looked out of the windows, but they
couldn't see anything.

117
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,150
'Don't be afraid,' Tom told his new friend.

118
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,729
'I'll go and see.

119
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,580
Perhaps it's an accident.

120
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,479
Stay here and you'll be OK.'

121
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,150
The old man smiled.

122
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,630
'Thank you, my young friend,' he said.

123
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,159
'I will stay here.

124
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,409
My old legs are very weak.'

125
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,069
Tom found the guard.

126
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,909
'What's wrong?' he asked him.

127
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,110
'Why did we stop?'

128
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,669
The guard looked at Tom unhappily.

129
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,460
'There's a large tree in front of the train,'
he said.

130
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,780
'We'll have to move it, but we can't do it
quickly.

131
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,990
So this is the end of the journey for you.

132
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,490
You'll have to get off the train and walk.'

133
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,590
'Walk where?'

134
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,460
Tom asked.

135
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,000
The guard looked at a map.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,130
'There's a village near here.

137
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,070
You can go there and perhaps find a restaurant
or a cafe.

138
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,380
I have to stay here with the train.

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,340
I'm very sorry about your journey.

140
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,330
But you'll get your money back.'

141
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,920
Tom thought, 'The money isn't important.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,710
I really wanted that job!'

143
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,040
And he felt very sad.

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,510
Tom didn't say anything about the job to the
old man.

145
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,470
He helped his friend off the train and carried
his case to the village.

146
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,970
'Thank you very much,' the old man said to
Tom.

147
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,370
'I know that my case is heavy.

148
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,080
There's a computer in it, and there are a
lot of papers.'

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,190
Tom smiled.

150
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,530
'It's all right,' he said.

151
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,840
But inside he was very sad.

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,770
'I was stupid,' he thought.

153
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,410
'I didn't listen to the old woman, but she
was right.

154
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,900
I won't get that job now.'

155
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:47,120
The old man saw Tom's sad face and asked him,
'What's wrong, my young friend?'

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,900
So Tom told him the story about the job in
the sports shop.

157
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,210
Then a strange thing happened.

158
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,460
The old man smiled, and then he laughed!

159
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,260
Why did he laugh?

160
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,420
Tom didn't know and he felt a little angry.

161
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,480
The old man was his friend, but this was a
bad day for Tom.

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,540
It wasn't funny!

163
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,060
Tom couldn't speak or smile.

164
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,130
The old man saw this and he stopped laughing.

165
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,640
Then he said, 'Listen to me, Tom, and don't
be sad.

166
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a rich man.

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,210
I've got a lot of shops in different towns,
and they're all sports shops.

168
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:48,960
I want an intelligent young man to work in
my new shop, It's also my biggest shop!

169
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,980
Will yon work for me?

170
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,460
I think I know you now.

171
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,010
You were very kind to me on the train.

172
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,880
You're the right person for the job.

173
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,030
What's your answer?'

174
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:08,540
'This is wonderful,' Tom said with a happy
smile.

175
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,740
'This is the best day of my life, not the
worst!'

176
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,100
- THE END -
