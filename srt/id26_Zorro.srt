CHAPTER ONE
A Stormy Night

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,040
Reina de Los Angeles is a Spanish village
in southern California.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,010
In the village there is a military presidio
with Spanish soldiers and their horses.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,499
There is also a Spanish church called a mission.

5
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:23,499
The Spanish friars live here.

6
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:28,369
All around the village there are big homes
with patios.

7
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,940
Tonight there is a terrible storm and it is
raining.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,060
Inside the village tavern there are soldiers
and other men.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,560
They are eating and drinking.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,201
Sergeant Pedro Gonzales is at the tavern.

11
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:41,120
He is a big, strong man.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,690
"What a horrible night!

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,890
It always rains in February.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,310
Where is Zorro on this stormy night?" asks
one soldier.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,310
"Zorro!

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,510
Don't say that name!

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,340
He is a bandit and a criminal,'' says Sergeant
Gonzales.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,250
"He is the terror of southern California,''
says another soldier.

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,470
"People say that he takes from the rich and
gives to the poor.

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,020
He is a friend of the natives and the friars.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,180
He punishes dishonest people," says an old
man.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
"Ha!

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,300
Zorro is a big mystery.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,310
Who is he?

25
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,230
Where is he from?

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,010
He wears a black mask and no one can see his
face.

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:35,300
He travels on the El Camino Real on his fast
horse.

28
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,900
He is very good with his sword," says the
Sergeant.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:48,040
"Yes, and he leaves his mark - the Z - everywhere,"
says the old man.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,340
"No one can stop him.

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:57,610
The Governor of California offers a big reward
for the capture of Zorro," says one soldier.

32
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,909
At that moment a man enters the tavern.

33
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,380
He is young and handsome.

34
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,400
He has black hair and dark eyes.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,129
He has fine clothes.

36
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,610
"Don Diego Vega, my friend!" says Sergeant
Gonzales.

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,349
"Your clothes are wet.

38
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,840
Why are you out on this rainy night?"

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,220
Don Diego smiles and says, "I am going home,
but I am cold and wet.

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,220
I want something to drink."

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,280
"Come and stand near the fire," says the Sergeant.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,590
"Here is a glass of wine."

43
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,190
"Thank you, my friend," says Don Diego.

44
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,360
"We are talking about Zorro.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,069
Everyone is scared of him, but I am not!

46
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,190
I am ready to fight Zorro and win!

47
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,020
I am a champion with the sword.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,920
What do you think, Don Diego?" asks the Sergeant.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,480
"Everyone talks about this mysterious man
with a mask.

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,650
Many people say good things about him," says
Don Diego.

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:13,410
"I want to fight him and capture him!

52
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,200
I want the big reward," says Sergeant Gonzales.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,300
"No, no!

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,480
Don't talk about fighting.

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,530
I hate fighting and I hate violence.

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,489
I think Zorro is sincere.

57
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,910
He punishes only bad people.

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:38,349
He protects the poor, the natives and the
friars.

59
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,610
Let Zorro do his work," says Don Diego.

60
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,959
"You are a kind man.

61
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,730
You like music and poetry.

62
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,050
You don't understand, my friend.

63
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,560
You are rich and noble," says the Sergeant.

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Don Diego smiles and says, "It's 6 p.m.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,770
I must return to my hacienda.

66
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,810
Good night everyone."

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,300
He opens the tavern door and goes out into
the rain.

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,129
CHAPTER TWO
A Surprise Visit

69
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,659
At 7 p.m. the door of tavern opens.

70
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:22,220
Sergeant Gonzales and the other soldiers are
standing near the fire.

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,020
They are talking about Don Diego Vega and
his rich family.

72
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,380
They turn around and see a man.

73
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,860
He is dressed in black.

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,400
He has a black mask and a black sombrero.

75
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,699
It is Zorro!

76
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,699
"Good evening!

77
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,260
My name is Zorro!" says the masked man.

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,200
The men in the tavern are very surprised and
scared.

79
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,370
Sergeant Gonzales looks at him carefully and
says, "What do you want, bandit?"

80
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,720
Zorro laughs loudly.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,850
He looks at Sergeant Gonzales and says," I
am here to punish you, Sergeant!"

82
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,410
"What do you mean?" says the Sergeant.

83
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,290
"You beat the poor natives.

84
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,790
I am a friend of the natives.

85
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,910
I am here to punish you."

86
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,960
"You idiot!

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,470
The governor wants you dead or alive!" says
Sergeant Gonzales.

88
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,650
He pulls out his sword and wants to fight.

89
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,199
At that moment Zorro pulls out a pistol.

90
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,169
He watches everyone carefully.

91
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:36,360
Sergeant Gonzales looks at the pistol and
says, "Courageous men don't use pistols.

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,949
They use swords.

93
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:43,250
Perhaps you are not courageous, Zorro?"

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:52,530
"This pistol is necessary because you have
many friends in this tavern.

95
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,639
Everyone must go near the fire and stay there!"
says Zorro.

96
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,970
"Now I have a pistol in my left hand and a
sword in my right hand.

97
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,470
I am ready to punish you."

98
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,190
"Fight, senor!" says the Sergeant.

99
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,270
They start fighting.

100
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,270
Their swords move quickly and make a lot of
noise.

101
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,020
The two men are good fighters.

102
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,789
Zorro is fast and light.

103
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,840
Sergeant Gonzales is slow and heavy.

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,130
Zorro jumps onto a table.

105
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,970
Then he jumps onto a chair.

106
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,080
The fight continues and Sergeant Gonzales'
sword falls onto the floor.

107
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,490
His face is white.

108
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,490
He is scared.

109
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,910
Zorro slaps his face and says, "This is your
punishment."

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,770
Then he makes a Z on the Sergeant's shirt
with his sword.

111
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,000
Zorro runs to the window.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,730
He opens it and says, "Good evening, gentlemen!"

113
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,690
He jumps out of the window and disappears.

114
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,039
CHAPTER THREE
The Pulido Hacienda

115
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,979
The next day is warm and sunny.

116
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:59,830
Don Diego gets on his beautiful horse.

117
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,610
He rides to Don Carlos Pulido's big hacienda.

118
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,130
Don Carlos is a good friend of Don Diego's
family.

119
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,370
Both families are rich and important.

120
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,729
But the Governor does not like Don Carlos.

121
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:22,330
He creates problems for him.

122
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:35,449
He wants to take Don Carlos' land.

123
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:50,460
Don Carlos is happy to see his friend.

124
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:57,960
"Good morning, Don Diego.

125
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,420
What a nice surprise!

126
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,430
Come and sit in the patio."

127
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,530
"Thank you.

128
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,569
I am here to say something very important,"
says Don Diego.

129
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,870
"I am almost 25 years old.

130
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,910
My father wants me to get married and start
a family.

131
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,840
I am not interested in marriage.

132
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:39,890
I think love and marriage are boring but I
must obey my father.

133
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,940
How old is your daughter Lolita?" asks Don
Diego.

134
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,269
"Lolita is 18 years old and she is very beautiful,"
answers Don Carlos.

135
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,680
"You have a fine family.

136
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,680
With your permission ', I want to marry your
daughter," says Don Diego.

137
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,810
Don Carlos smiles and is happy.

138
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,009
"This is an honour for our family.

139
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,980
You have my permission!

140
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,920
Do you want to see Lolita?"

141
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,889
"I think I must!"

142
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,360
answers Don Diego.

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,699
Don Carlos calls her and she comes to the
patio.

144
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:24,069
Lolita is a lovely girl with long black hair
and dark eyes.

145
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:25,149
"Good morning, senorita.

146
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,429
There is something I must tell you," says
Don Diego smiling.

147
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,850
"I want to marry you and your father approves."

148
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,850
"Oh, senor!"

149
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,850
exclaims Lolita.

150
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,850
"You want to marry me!"

151
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,850
She is surprised and her face is red.

152
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,170
"Think about it today.

153
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,670
One of my servants can bring me your answer
tomorrow."

154
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,839
"But why can't you come tomorrow?" asks Lolita.

155
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,910
"Oh, your hacienda is far.

156
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,689
I get tired when I ride my horse.

157
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:54,519
I prefer to stay at home and rest."

158
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,519
"What!

159
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,779
You want to marry me and you don't want to
visit me!

160
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,079
Is this your idea of love?

161
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:09,839
I want to marry a strong, romantic man.

162
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,959
You are young and rich, but you are not strong
or romantic!

163
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,569
Do you have a heart?" says Lolita.

164
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:22,570
She is angry.

165
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,889
She runs away and tells her mother.

166
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:30,149
Doha Catalina says, "You are lucky, Lolita.

167
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,959
Don Diego is very rich.

168
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:34,339
He comes from a noble family.

169
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:36,329
The Governor likes his family.

170
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,500
This is a big opportunity for our family."

171
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,050
In the afternoon Lolita is alone in the patio.

172
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,939
She is thinking about Don Diego.

173
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,920
Suddenly she hears a noise and turns around.

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,529
She sees standing in front of her.

175
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,529
"Zorro!"

176
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:51,529
she whispers.

177
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:52,529
"Don't be afraid, senorita.

178
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,529
I only punish corrupt people.

179
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,699
I like your father because he is honest.

180
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,129
I am here to admire your beauty."

181
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,129
"What!

182
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,129
You must go away.

183
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:01,910
You are in great danger," says Lolita.

184
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,990
"You are beautiful and kind, Lolita," says
Zorro.

185
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,920
"Let me kiss your hand."

186
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,009
Zorro takes her small hand and kisses it.

187
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,549
Lolita looks into his eyes and smiles.

188
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,670
Then she runs into the house.

189
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,170
"What a courageous man!

190
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,139
He is a bandit but I like him," Lolita thinks.

191
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,779
CHAPTER FOUR
Captain Ramon

192
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,299
At 8 p.m. it is dinner time at Don Carlos'
home.

193
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,369
The family is sitting at the table.

194
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:35,980
Someone knocks at the door.

195
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,569
A servant opens it and Zorro appears!

196
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,339
Don Carlos, his wife and daughter stand up.

197
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,670
They are scared.

198
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,540
"Good evening," says Zorro.

199
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,819
"Don't be scared!

200
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,819
You are an honest man, Don Carlos.

201
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:56,830
I only want some food and drink."

202
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:12,829
Zorro goes to Lolita and whispers, "I cannot
forget this afternoon in the patio."

203
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:15,720
"You must not come here.

204
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,939
It is dangerous!"

205
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:17,939
whispers Lolita.

206
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,880
Suddenly a young Spanish soldier enters the
house.

207
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,269
He is Captain Ramon.

208
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,000
He wants to arrest Zorro.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Zorro takes out his sword and they fight.

210
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,750
The two men are good fighters.

211
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,339
"I want to arrest you, Zorro," says Captain
Ramon.

212
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,920
"You are a public enemy."

213
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,109
"You cannot arrest me!" says Zorro.

214
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:43,029
Zorro injures the Captain's shoulder with
his sword.

215
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,569
The Captain falls to the floor.

216
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,569
"Please help the Captain!"

217
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,820
Zorro says to Don Carlos.

218
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,009
Then he smiles at Lolita and rides away on
his horse.

219
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,299
Don Carlos' wife and daughter look after Captain
Ramon's injured shoulder.

220
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:01,410
The Captain likes beautiful Lolita.

221
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,639
"Don Carlos,'' says the Captain, "I like Lolita
very much.

222
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,910
I come from a good family and I am the Governor's
friend.

223
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,709
I am 23 years old and I am the Captain of
the Presidio.

224
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:17,920
May I court Lolita?"

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,879
"First, I must explain something," says Don
Carlos.

226
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,709
"Don Diego Vega wants to court Lolita too.

227
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:29,101
Lolita must choose her husband herself, but
you have my permission to court her!"

228
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:33,629
The next morning there is a lot of noise at
the Presidio Don.

229
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,939
Diego and other men are watching.

230
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:40,089
There are many soldiers on their horses.

231
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,669
They are listening to Sergeant Gonzales.

232
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,919
"Today is an important day.

233
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,829
We must find Zorro!

234
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,350
We must look in every hacienda and in every
home.

235
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,619
Remember the Governor's big reward.

236
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:52,619
Let's go!"

237
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:53,869
That morning Don Diego sends a letter to Don
Carlos:

238
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:54,869
My dear friend,

239
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,320
Sergeant Gonzales and his soldiers want to
arrest Zorro.

240
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,209
It is dangerous for you and your family to
stay at your hacienda.

241
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,829
Please come to my home in Reina de Los Angeles.

242
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:06,999
It is safe in my home.

243
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:10,459
I must go away for a few days.

244
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,959
Your friend,

245
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,459
Diego Vega.

246
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:19,230
Don Carlos receives the letter and says, "What
a generous invitation!

247
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,399
Don Diego wants to protect Lolita.

248
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,730
We must accept the invitation.

249
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,109
Let us go immediately!"

250
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,660
CHAPTER FIVE
Lolita is in Love

251
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,550
Don Diego's home in Reina de Los Angeles is
big and beautiful.

252
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,949
There are many rooms and many servants.

253
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:41,839
There is a big garden with trees and flowers.

254
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,359
Don Carlos and his family like it.

255
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,359
"Lolita!

256
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:53,100
Marry Don Diego and this beautiful home is
yours!" says Doha Catalina.

257
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,529
"I don't love Don Diego!

258
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:02,029
I don't want to marry him!" says Lolita.

259
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:12,149
"Lolita, tonight your mother and I must visit
our old friends," says Don Carlos.

260
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,660
"Can you stay at home alone?"

261
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,910
"Yes, of course.

262
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,809
There are many books in Don Diego's library.

263
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:22,679
I can stay here and read."

264
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,550
Lolita looks at the books.

265
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,550
"How strange!"

266
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,550
she thinks.

267
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,410
"Don Diego has books about love, passion,
adventure, horses and heroes!

268
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,049
But he isn't strong and is so lifeless !"

269
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,829
Suddenly there is a knock at the door.

270
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,560
A servant opens it and Captain Ramon enters.

271
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,109
He goes to the library and sees Lolita.

272
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,190
"I'm glad you are alone!

273
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,059
You are a very beautiful girl.

274
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,720
I have your father's permission to court you!

275
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,519
I know that Don Diego wants to marry you,
but I am superior in every way.

276
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,559
Don Diego has no courage.

277
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,600
He is a weak man.

278
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,459
I am the Captain of the Presidio."

279
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,499
"I am alone,'' says Lolita.

280
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,129
"You cannot stay here.

281
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,699
It is not right.

282
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,139
Please go away!"

283
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:14,439
Captain Ramon takes her hand and says, "Don't
run away, Lolita.

284
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,889
You are mine!

285
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:16,889
Kiss me!"

286
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,519
Lolita pushes him away and says, "I don't
want to kiss you.

287
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,519
Go away!"

288
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,180
"No, you are mine.

289
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
You must marry me.

290
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
Now kiss me!"

291
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,739
Lolita slaps the Captain's face.

292
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:35,970
At that moment Zorro appears in the library
and says, "Captain Ramon, you are a villain.

293
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,990
Don't touch Lolita!

294
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,360
Leave this house immediately!"

295
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,169
"I cannot forget this terrible insult," says
the Captain.

296
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,290
His face is red with anger.

297
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,470
Zorro opens the door and kicks him out.

298
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,689
"Thank you for your help, Zorro.

299
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:50,429
You are courageous and kind.

300
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:51,489
I love you!"

301
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:52,489
Lolita says.

302
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,489
"Dear Lolita, I love you too!"

303
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:54,489
says Zorro.

304
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,790
They embrace and kiss.

305
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,149
CHAPTER SIX
Friar Felipe

306
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,220
Captain Ramon returns to the Presidio.

307
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,369
He is furious.

308
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:03,239
"I must punish Lolita, her family and Zorro
for their insults!" he thinks.

309
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,390
"I must write a letter to the Governor.

310
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,309
I must tell him that Don Carlos Pulido and
his family are traitors.

311
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:09,309
They are Zorro's friends.

312
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,309
They help him."

313
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,669
He writes the letter and sends it to the Governor.

314
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,169
He smiles and says, "I want to see the Pulido
family in prison!"

315
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,939
"I want to see you in prison!" says a man's
voice.

316
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,579
Captain Ramon turns around and sees Zorro.

317
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,130
"You are a villain.

318
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,760
Fight me but don't hurt the Pulido family!"
says Zorro.

319
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,530
"Sergeant Gonzales, come quickly!" says the
Captain.

320
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,230
"Zorro is here."

321
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,850
Zorro disappears.

322
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,549
"I am here, Captain," says Sergeant Gonzales.

323
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,850
"Take all the soldiers and find Zorro!

324
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,740
We must capture him."

325
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,630
The soldiers follow Zorro.

326
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,139
The night is dark.

327
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:57,419
It is difficult to follow him because his
horse is very fast.

328
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:01,940
The next morning the soldiers return to the
Presidio.

329
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,260
They are tired and angry.

330
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,940
Zorro is still free.

331
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,080
There are many people in front of the Presidio
that morning.

332
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,850
Don Diego is there too.

333
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,039
Something is happening.

334
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,549
An old friar is standing before the magistrate
L The old friar is in chains.

335
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,200
"I am not a thief," says the old friar.

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,539
"I am a poor friar."

337
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,340
"What is happening?" asks Don Diego.

338
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,139
"This old friar is a thief.

339
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,399
He must be punished," answers the magistrate.

340
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,799
"That is impossible.

341
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:36,600
Friar Felipe is an honest man.

342
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,399
I know him," says Don Diego.

343
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:45,809
"No, you are wrong," says the cruel magistrate.

344
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:55,539
He calls two soldiers and says, "Whip this
friar 15 times."

345
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,870
The soldiers whip the old friar and he falls
to the ground.

346
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,929
Don Diego is very angry because Friar Felipe
is his friend.

347
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:08,080
He returns to his father's hacienda.

348
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,340
"Good afternoon, my son," says his father,
Don Alejandro Vega.

349
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,490
"I am happy to see you.

350
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,230
Come and tell me about Lolita.

351
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,190
Does she want to marry you?"

352
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,130
"I like Lolita, but she doesn't like me.

353
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,100
She likes romantic men.

354
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,549
What can I do?" asks Don Diego.

355
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,019
"Girls like courageous, romantic men.

356
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,490
You must talk about love.

357
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,669
You must play the guitar and sing love songs.

358
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:41,309
Give her some flowers.

359
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,669
This is what young men do.

360
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,039
Wake up, Diego!" says Don Alejandro.

361
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,039
"How ridiculous!

362
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,370
I cannot do these stupid things," says Don
Diego.

363
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,549
"You must try.

364
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,700
Lolita is a lovely girl," says Don Alejandro.

365
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,269
"There are many problems in my life.

366
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,110
I want to rest and meditate," says Don Diego.

367
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,110
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Avengers

368
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,070
In the evening the magistrate and his friends
are in the tavern.

369
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,019
They are laughing about the old friar.

370
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,580
Why are you laughing?" asks a mysterious voice.

371
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,240
They look at the door of the tavern and see
Zorro.

372
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,750
He has a pistol in one hand and a sword in
the other.

373
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,750
"Magistrate!

374
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:35,289
I am here to punish you," says Zorro. "Old
Friar Felipe is not a thief and you know it."

375
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,179
"I am an important magistrate.

376
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,789
I don't like friars because they are your
friends, Zorro."

377
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,000
Zorro gives a whip to the magistrate's friend
and says, "Now whip this corrupt magistrate

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
15 times."

379
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,250
"But I cannot do this," says the friend.

380
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:56,009
"Whip him or I whip you!" says Zorro.

381
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,850
The friend whips the magistrate.

382
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,730
After the punishment the magistrate falls
to the ground.

383
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,000
''This is how I punish dishonest people,''
says Zorro.

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,990
The next day everyone talks about the magistrate's
punishment.

385
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:19,100
A group of young men want to help Captain
Ramon arrest Zorro.

386
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:29,320
They 

387
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,159
look for him in the hills and in the valleys.

388
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,049
In the evening they go to the Vega hacienda.

389
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:43,960
When Don Alejandro sees them he says, "Why
are you all here?"

390
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,100
"We are looking for Zorro.

391
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,720
We want to capture the bandit and get the
reward.

392
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
But now we are tired and hungry.

393
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,140
Can you give us some food?"

394
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
"Yes, of course.

395
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
Please come in.

396
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,059
You can put your swords and pistols near the
door," says Don Alejandro.

397
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,059
"Sit down!

398
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,850
Eat these cakes and this wine."

399
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,309
Don Alejandro and Don Diego talk to the young
men.

400
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:11,679
At 9 p.m. Don Diego says, "Please excuse me.

401
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,210
I am tired and I am going to bed."

402
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,650
"Look, Diego, these young men are not tired.

403
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,880
It's only 9 p.m.

404
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,269
You are young but you are always tired," says
Don Alejandro.

405
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,500
"Yes, father, you are right.

406
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,840
Good night everyone!"

407
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,529
The others eat, drink and sing.

408
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:43,840
At midnight a masked man appears at the door.

409
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,960
"Look, it is Zorro!" says one of the young
men.

410
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,580
"Zorro, the bandit," they all say.

411
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,230
"Yes, I am Zorro, but I am not a bandit.

412
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,090
I have principles and I fight for them.

413
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:01,260
In California we have corrupt political men,
cruel magistrates and dishonest people.

414
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,419
I want to change this.

415
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:10,799
I fight to help the poor, the natives and
the friars.

416
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,309
What are your principles?"

417
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:23,530
"We want to help the poor, the natives and
the friars too," says one young man.

418
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,380
"Our principles are the same," says another.

419
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,780
"Come with me and we can fight together!

420
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:38,330
We can make California a better place to live,"
says Zorro.

421
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,590
"But who are you?

422
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,350
Where do you live?" asks a young man.

423
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,730
"I can't tell you.

424
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,450
It's a secret,'' says Zorro.

425
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,169
The young men talk together.

426
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,580
"Yes, we want to fight with you.

427
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,460
We want justice in California.

428
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,179
Our new name is The Avengers!" says a young
man.

429
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:59,629
"Yes, we are The Avengers," they all say.

430
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:00,629
"Good!

431
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:01,990
We now fight together!"

432
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,590
says Zorro and leaves.

433
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,340
CHAPTER EIGHT
The Escape

434
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,710
The Governor of California is here today,
says Sergeant Gonzales.

435
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,890
"Good!" says Captain Ramon.

436
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,880
"I must speak to him"

437
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,679
"Good morning, Captain Ramon," says the Governor."

438
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,750
I have your letter.

439
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:32,629
Thank you for the information about the Pulido
family.

440
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,929
They are Zorro's friends.

441
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:36,649
They are traitors.

442
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:41,610
We must put them in prison and kill them!

443
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,429
They are dangerous."

444
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,860
"What a good idea!

445
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,750
My soldiers can arrest them today," says the
Captain.

446
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,330
A group of soldiers goes to the Pulido hacienda.

447
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:04,100
They arrest Don Carlos, Dona Catalina and
Lolita.

448
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,299
They take them to prison.

449
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,649
Don Carlos is furious.

450
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,940
His wife and daughter cry.

451
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:27,100
When Don Diego hears about this, he goes to
the Governor.

452
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:37,710
He asks him, "Why is the Pulido family in
prison?"

453
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,769
The Governor answers, "They are Zorro's friends.

454
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,669
They help and protect him.

455
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:43,669
They are traitors!"

456
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,669
"I cannot believe this.

457
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:45,669
I know them.

458
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,669
They are honest people.

459
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:48,659
They don't help bandits," says Don Diego.

460
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,259
"You are wrong, Don Diego.

461
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,549
They must be punished.

462
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,129
The punishment for traitors is death," says
the Governor.

463
00:25:55,129 --> 00:26:01,330
Early in the evening Zorro sends a message
to The Avengers.

464
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,490
The message says:

465
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,990
"Meet me at midnight at the lake Bring your
swords and pistols.

466
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,299
Pass the word to everyone."

467
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,080
At midnight Zorro and The Avengers meet at
the lake.

468
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,809
Every Avenger has a mask on his face.

469
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,950
Zorro says, "We are here to rescue Don Pulido
and his family.

470
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,080
They must escape from prison.

471
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,960
They are innocent.

472
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,559
We must be silent, enter the prison and help
them.

473
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,230
Francisco, you take Don Carlos to the village
of Pala.

474
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,889
Jose, you take Doha Catalina to the Vega hacienda.

475
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:47,509
I want to take Lolita to Friar Felipe.

476
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,990
They must hide for a few days."

477
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,840
Zorro and The Avengers rescue the Pulido family.

478
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:04,559
Don Carlos and Doha Catalina reach their destination.

479
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,690
The soldiers follow Zorro and Lolita.

480
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,559
Zorro's horse is very fast.

481
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,149
Zorro and Lolita arrive at Friar Felipe's
hacienda.

482
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:21,419
Zorro says, "Can Lolita stay here with you
for a few days?

483
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,070
She is in danger."

484
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,119
"Yes, I can protect her," says Friar Felipe.

485
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,240
Zorro kisses Lolita and says, "Always remember
that I love you."

486
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,970
Then he rides away on his horse.

487
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,019
CHAPTER NINE
The Man behind the Mask

488
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:42,090
The soldiers follow Zorro all night.

489
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,019
They cannot capture him.

490
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:48,720
The next night Zorro silently enters the Governor's
home.

491
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,950
He wants to talk to the Governor and Captain
Ramon.

492
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,309
They are sitting near the fire.

493
00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:01,480
Zorro enters and says, "Don't move and don't
make a noise.

494
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,200
I want to speak to you."

495
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,169
He has a pistol in one hand and a sword in
the other.

496
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,169
"Zorro!

497
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,169
Why are you here?"

498
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,169
asks the Governor.

499
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,559
"You are here to die!" says Captain Ramon.

500
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,700
"No," answers Zorro, "I am here to bring justice.

501
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,940
I am here to learn the truth.

502
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,980
Governor, you want to punish the Pulido family.

503
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Why?"

504
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
"They are traitors.

505
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,710
They are your friends, Zorro!

506
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,960
They help you.

507
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,360
Your friends are my enemies,'' says the Governor.

508
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,419
"They are not traitors.

509
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:45,230
They do not help me.

510
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,809
They are not my friends," he says.

511
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,050
"Look at this letter.

512
00:28:51,050 --> 00:29:00,510
It accuses them," says 
the Governor.

513
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:07,210
Zorro reads the letter and says, "It is Captain
Ramon's letter.

514
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,619
He accuses the Pulido family."

515
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:19,220
Zorro looks at the Captain and says, "Captain,
you are a liar but I am here to punish you.

516
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,639
Tell the Governor the truth about the Pulido
family."

517
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:28,909
Zorro puts his pistol to Captain Ramon's head
and says, "Tell the Governor the truth or

518
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:29,909
I shoot!"

519
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:31,820
Captain Ramon is silent.

520
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,480
His face is white.

521
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,580
"Tell the truth, you liar,'' says Zorro.

522
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:46,029
"Yes, I am 
a liar.

523
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:50,690
The letter is not true."

524
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,360
"This is terrible!" says the Governor.

525
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,690
"You are a liar.

526
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:05,270
You cannot be the Captain of the Presidio!"

527
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:15,259
At that moment the Captain pulls out his sword.

528
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:18,340
He begins to fight Zorro.

529
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,999
It is a long sword fight.

530
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,080
In the end, Zorro kills Captain Ramon.

531
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,999
"The Captain is dead," says Zorro to the Governor.

532
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:35,409
Outside the Governor's home there are many
soldiers.

533
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:37,309
They want to capture Zorro.

534
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,749
He sees Lolita on her horse.

535
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:45,210
He shouts, "Lolita, come with me.

536
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,110
We must hide in the old tavern.

537
00:30:49,110 --> 00:31:02,600
This time it is very difficult to escape.

538
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:10,440
There are soldiers all around us."

539
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,019
"I'm happy to be with you Zorro," says Lolita.

540
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:18,210
"I'm not scared."

541
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:28,580
Zorro and Lolita hide inside the old tavern.

542
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,770
The soldiers try to enter.

543
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,770
Zorro is ready to fight.

544
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,499
Suddenly The Avengers come to rescue Zorro
and Lolita.

545
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:40,870
They explain many things to the Governor.

546
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,500
The Governor pardons Zorro.

547
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,580
Zorro and Lolita walk out of the old tavern.

548
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,989
They are free.

549
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:51,019
Everyone is happy and cheers.

550
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:55,450
The Governor says, "Now that you are free,
show us your face!"

551
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,450
"Yes!

552
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,450
Yes!" the people say.

553
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,710
Zorro takes off his black mask.

554
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,460
"It's Don Diego Vega!"

555
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,779
exclaims Sergeant Gonzales.

556
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,539
Everyone is very surprised.

557
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,290
"My son, Don Diego!

558
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,049
I can't believe it!"

559
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:09,369
exclaims Don Alejandro.

560
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:17,950
Lolita looks at him and says, "Is this true
or is it a dream?

561
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,230
Are you really Don Diego?"

562
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,100
"Yes, my love.

563
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:34,220
I am your Don Diego and your Zorro!" he says
embracing Lolita.

564
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:45,590
- THE END -
