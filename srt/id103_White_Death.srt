00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,120
CHAPTER ONE
The woman stood in front of the prison.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
The prison was a big, dirty building in the
biggest town of a hot country.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
The woman was very hot, and she did not like
the noise from all the cars in the road.

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
She was an Englishwoman and she did not like
hot countries or a lot of noise.

5
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
She was tall, about fifty years old, with
blue eyes and a long face.

6
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Her face was red, and she looked tired and
angry.

7
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
She knocked at the door of the prison.

8
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,120
For a long time nothing happened.

9
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,030
Then a little window opened in the door, and
a man looked out at her.

10
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,839
'Yes?

11
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,599
What do you want?'

12
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,640
'I want to see my daughter.

13
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,930
It's very important.'

14
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,150
'Name?'

15
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,590
'Anna Harland.'

16
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,810
'Is that your name or your daughter's name?'

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,190
'It's my name.

18
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,700
My daughter's name is Sarah Harland.'

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,129
'You can't visit her today.

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,899
Come back on Wednesday.'

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,070
'No!

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,339
I came from England to see her today.

23
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:53,079
It's very important.

24
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,280
She's going to court tomorrow.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,800
Please take me to her - now!'

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,790
'Wait a minute.'

27
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,680
The little window closed, but the door did
not open.

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,790
The woman waited in front of the door for
a long time.

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,540
A lot of people in the road looked at her.

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,690
One or two young men laughed, but she did
not move.

31
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:35,460
She stood there in the hot road in front of
the prison door, and waited.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,100
After twenty minutes, the door opened.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,840
'Come with me,' the man said.

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,600
The woman went in with him.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,360
It was dark in the prison, and at first she
could not see very well.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,570
She walked for a long time, past hundreds
of doors.

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,490
Then the man opened one of them.

38
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,530
'In here,' he said.

39
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,150
'You can have ten minutes.'

40
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,840
Anna Harland walked into the room and the
man went in after her.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,310
He closed the door behind him.

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,450
There was a table in the room, and two chairs.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,980
On one of the chairs sat her daughter, Sarah.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,670
She was a tall girl, about nineteen years
old, with big blue eyes.

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,670
'Mother!'

46
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,659
she said.

47
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,739
'I'm very happy to see you.'

48
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:03,430
And she got up and began to run across the
room to her mother.

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,439
'Sarah!'

50
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,290
Anna said, and put out her arms.

51
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,310
But the man moved quickly and stood between
them.

52
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,560
'No,' he said to Anna.

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,400
'I'm sorry.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,090
I know you're her mother.

55
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,730
You can talk, but that's all.

56
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,849
Please sit down at the table.

57
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,620
I am here to watch you.'

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,790
The mother and daughter sat down at the table.

59
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,219
Anna's hands were near Sarah's on the table.

60
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,219
She looked carefully at her daughter.

61
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,939
Sarah's dress and face were dirty.

62
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,170
'She's tired, and unhappy,' Anna thought.

63
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,669
'Sarah, what happened?'

64
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,999
she said.

65
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:16,010
'We have ten minutes to talk.

66
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,229
No more.

67
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:22,669
Tell me, please, quickly.

68
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,669
I want to help you.'

69
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,620
Sarah looked at her mother.

70
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,639
'Oh, mother, I'm happy you're here.

71
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,400
I wanted you to come.

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,060
Mother, I...

73
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,910
I didn't do it.

74
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,550
It isn't true.

75
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,270
Please believe me.'

76
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,230
'Of course I believe you, Sarah.

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,860
But tell me about it.

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,880
What happened?

79
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,389
Quickly.

80
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,080
Begin at the beginning.'

81
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,300
'Yes, but...

82
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,680
I don't know...

83
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,389
When did it begin?

84
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:18,010
I don't know... I don't understand it.'

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,340
'Why did the police arrest you?

86
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,050
When did they bring you to this prison?'

87
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,090
'Last week, I think.

88
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,510
Yes, last week.

89
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,180
At the airport, when we arrived...

90
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,180
The police stopped us, and looked in our bags.

91
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,190
Then...'

92
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,699
Sarah looked down at the table.

93
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,740
'She's crying,' Anna thought.

94
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,650
'She's very unhappy.'

95
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,169
'What happened then, Sarah?'

96
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,009
her mother asked.

97
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:10,409
'They... they said there were drugs in my
bag.

98
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:18,550
Then they took me into a room and told me
to take my dress off.

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,439
They looked for more drugs, but they found
nothing.

100
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,889
Then... then they brought me here.'

101
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,250
'I see.

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,970
Where were the drugs, then?

103
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,080
Where did they find them?'

104
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,199
'Oh.

105
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,389
They didn't tell you?'

106
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,229
Sarah stopped crying.

107
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,360
She looked up, and there was a smile on her
face.

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,150
But it was not a happy smile.

109
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,380
'The drugs were in a tube of toothpaste.

110
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:13,759
A toothpaste tube with drugs in it... heroin...
not toothpaste.'

111
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,099
'And you didn't know about it?'

112
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:22,510
'No, mother, of course not.

113
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,210
Do you think I clean my teeth with heroin?'

114
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,370
Anna Harland smiled.

115
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,810
It was difficult to smile, because she was
afraid.

116
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,280
But she smiled because she wanted to help
her daughter.

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,870
'I know you don't clean your teeth with heroin.

118
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,810
You have very good teeth, Sarah.

119
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,139
But...

120
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,240
what about Stephen?

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,919
Did he know about the heroin?

122
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,009
Did he put it in the toothpaste tube?'

123
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,590
'Stephen?

124
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,650
No... why do you ask about Stephen, mother?'

125
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,949
'Well, is he in prison too?

126
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,080
You said "us" and "our bags".

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,639
Did the police arrest him too?'

128
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,499
'Oh...

129
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,450
no,' Sarah's face was unhappy.

130
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,430
'No.

131
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,039
I wasn't with Stephen, mother.

132
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,440
You see, Stephen and I...

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,570
well, we aren't friends now.

134
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:58,390
I left him about two months ago... and then
I met Hassan.'

135
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,970
'Hassan?'

136
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,540
'Yes.

137
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,740
I was with Hassan at the airport.

138
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:16,060
Stephen was on the plane too - I don't know
why - but he wasn't with me.

139
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,800
It's Hassan - he was with me.

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,139
Hassan's important to me now, not Stephen.'

141
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,589
Anna looked at her daughter.

142
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,680
'I see.

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,760
And did the police arrest this Hassan too?

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,690
Is he in prison?'

145
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,100
'Yes, he is.

146
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,390
They arrested him but I can't see him.

147
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,250
I asked them.

148
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,430
I wanted to see him.

149
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,130
But they said "no".

150
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:05,800
Mother, I'm sure Hassan didn't know about
the heroin.

151
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,470
He's a good man... he didn't know, I'm sure.'

152
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,040
'Then why was the heroin in your bag, Sarah?'

153
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,100
'I don't know, mother...

154
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,590
I don't know.'

155
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,930
The man looked at the clock in the room.

156
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,800
'I'm sorry, Mrs Harland,' he said.

157
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,370
'But that's ten minutes.

158
00:10:37,370 --> 00:11:54,850
It's time 

159
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,139
to go.'

160
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,839
Anna Harland stood up slowly.

161
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,600
'All right,' she said.

162
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,889
'But don't be afraid, Sarah.

163
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:13,889
I'm coming to the court tomorrow.'

164
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,850
'Yes, mother,' Sarah said.

165
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,620
'Thank you.

166
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:28,040
The police are bringing Hassan to court tomorrow
too, I think.

167
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,440
You can see him there.

168
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,829
He's a good man, mother, and...

169
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm sure he didn't know about the drugs.'

170
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,730
'Perhaps,' Anna said.

171
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:54,410
She walked slowly to the door, and then stood
by the door and looked at her daughter again.

172
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,860
'Sarah...

173
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,480
you are telling me the truth, aren't you?'

174
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,660
Sarah began to cry again.

175
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,700
'Yes, mother, of course I am.

176
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,820
I always tell you the truth, you know that.'

177
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,130
Anna smiled.

178
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,500
'Yes, Sarah,' she said quietly.

179
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,639
'Yes, I believe you.'

180
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,889
She went through the door and the man went
out after her.

181
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:42,940
Sarah sat quietly at the table in the room,
and looked at her hands.

182
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,660
'Yes,' she thought.

183
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,200
'I told you the truth, mother.

184
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,730
I always tell you the truth.

185
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,990
But I didn't tell you everything...'

186
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:07,300
She put her head in her hands.

187
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:15,269
CHAPTER TWO
Anna Harland left the prison and went to talk

188
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,750
to the police.

189
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:28,949
She waited a long time in a small office,
but after an hour a policeman came into the

190
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,680
room.

191
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:42,760
He was a big man, about fifty-five years old,
with brown eyes and a nice smile.

192
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,980
He moved very slowly and quietly.

193
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,450
'Good afternoon, Mrs Harland,' he said.

194
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:59,020
'My name is Detective Inspector Aziz.

195
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,399
I... arrested your daughter three days ago.

196
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm very sorry for you.

197
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,250
This is a very unhappy thing for a mother...'

198
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:25,790
'It's a very unhappy thing for my daughter,
Inspector,' Anna said angrily.

199
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,399
'Because she didn't do it.

200
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,930
She's innocent, you know.

201
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:40,250
She knows nothing about those drugs.'

202
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:47,579
Detective Inspector Aziz looked at her carefully
for a minute.

203
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,089
He did not know many English women.

204
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,080
'She has an interesting face,' he thought.

205
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,949
'Very blue eyes, and a long nose.

206
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:11,420
She is not afraid of me, and she is not crying.

207
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,569
Perhaps she wants to know the truth.

208
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:21,710
Perhaps she can help me, too.'

209
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,009
'Well, Mrs Harland,' he said slowly.

210
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,800
'It's difficult for me.

211
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,329
Is your daughter telling the truth?

212
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,009
Is she innocent?

213
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,569
Because the drugs were in her bag, you know.'

214
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:49,529
'I know,' Anna said.

215
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:54,389
'But she was with a young man...

216
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,250
Hassan.

217
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,310
She doesn't know him very well, I think.

218
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,530
Tell me about him, please.

219
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,660
I want to know.'

220
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,350
Inspector Aziz smiled.

221
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,860
'All right,' he said.

222
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,780
'But first, tell me about your daughter.

223
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,839
Why was she on that plane?

224
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,710
Why did she come to this country?

225
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,120
Tell me.'

226
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,420
Anna Harland looked at him.

227
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,630
'He's a nice man,' she thought.

228
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,150
'He listens to people.

229
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,789
Perhaps he wants to help.

230
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:52,070
Perhaps he can understand Sarah.'

231
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,350
'Do you have daughters?'

232
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,910
she asked.

233
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,309
'Yes,' the Inspector answered.

234
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:03,830
'Two.'

235
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:09,900
'Then perhaps you can understand,' Anna said.

236
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,289
'Sarah is nineteen.

237
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:24,020
She finished school last year, and she worked
for six months in a hospital to get some money.

238
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:31,370
Then she and her boyfriend, Stephen, visited
a lot of countries.

239
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:41,670
They went to Greece, Turkey, India, Australia
- and now they're here.

240
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:51,070
They're young, and they want to see new countries
and new towns and new people.

241
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,610
That's all.'

242
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,210
'I see,' the Inspector said.

243
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:10,490
'But sometimes young people do things - bad
things - because they are in a different country

244
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,260
and they need money.'

245
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,100
'Not Sarah,' Anna said.

246
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,559
'And not heroin.

247
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:27,140
Sarah worked in a hospital, and she knows
about heroin.

248
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,330
She knows it can kill people.

249
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm a doctor, and she wants to be a doctor,
too.'

250
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:45,070
'I see,' the Inspector said again.

251
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,210
He looked at her, and thought, but he said
nothing.

252
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,200
'Now,' Anna said.

253
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,480
'Tell me about this young man, Hassan.'

254
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,370
'All right,' the Inspector said.

255
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:12,410
He took some papers from the table and began
to read to her.

256
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,650
'But we don't know very much about him.

257
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,750
He's a rich boy, from a good family.

258
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
His father has two or three shops, I think.

259
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:35,580
And the police in his town know him, too.

260
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,700
Last year his father gave him a new car - a
very fast car.

261
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,770
And... listen to this!

262
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:54,970
One day he hit a police car, and the police
car went into the river!

263
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,940
What a story!

264
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,909
His father bought a new car for the police.

265
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,710
His father has a lot of money.'

266
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:13,750
The Inspector smiled, but Anna looked unhappy.

267
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,549
'Oh dear,' she said.

268
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,039
'That's not very good.'

269
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,640
'No,' he said.

270
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,809
'It isn't good.

271
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:32,790
But this story about the heroin is worse.

272
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,330
Much worse.

273
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,780
I don't like this story.'

274
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:51,240
CHAPTER THREE
Next morning, Anna Harland went to the court.

275
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,880
She was first there.

276
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,409
She sat in the courtroom and waited.

277
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:08,570
A lot of people came in, and she saw a man
and his wife.

278
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,170
'Perhaps they're Hassan's father and mother,'
Anna thought.

279
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,611
But she did not want to talk to them.

280
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:25,650
The lawyers came in next, with a lot of papers.

281
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:33,080
They sat at a table in front of her, and talked
quietly.

282
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:43,330
'Those two lawyers,' Anna thought, 'they're
old friends.

283
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:54,370
But one of them wants my daughter to die,
and one wants her to be free.'

284
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:02,809
After the lawyers, the jury came in - twelve
people, men and women.

285
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,720
They sat down and watched the lawyers.

286
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,480
They looked at Anna, and then talked quietly
about her.

287
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,770
'These people don't look very important,'
she thought.

288
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:29,179
'But they are the most important people here.

289
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:40,000
They're going to say "she did it"... or "she
didn't do it".

290
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,980
And then Sarah comes home to me... or she
dies.'

291
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,240
She watched their faces carefully.

292
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,580
Then some policemen came in.

293
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:05,809
Inspector Aziz saw Anna and smiled at her.

294
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:15,330
But Anna did not talk to him, because Sarah
came in at the same time.

295
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:22,580
She looked afraid, and her face was very white.

296
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:33,640
She looked across the courtroom, saw her mother,
and gave her an unhappy smile.

297
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:43,070
There were two policemen behind Sarah, but
Anna did not look at them.

298
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:52,910
She looked at the tall dark young man next
to Sarah - Hassan!

299
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,830
'He's about twenty years old,' Anna thought.

300
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,140
'He's very tall.

301
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:10,570
But he has a nice face, and very beautiful
dark eyes.

302
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,230
Sarah likes him, and I can understand that.

303
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:25,080
But he looks very unhappy, too... and afraid.

304
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,450
His hands are moving all the time.'

305
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,190
Hassan looked at Sarah and smiled.

306
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,429
She smiled back at him.

307
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:52,799
Anna wanted to talk to Sarah, but just then
a policeman said loudly: 'All stand, please.'

308
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,160
Everybody stood up, and the judge came into
the courtroom.

309
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,110
He went to his chair and sat down.

310
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:08,659
The police lawyer began.

311
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:18,510
'These two young people came into our country
last week,' he said.

312
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:28,850
'The young man lives in this country, and
the young woman is English.

313
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:41,220
At the airport, the police looked in their
bags, and they found three tubes of toothpaste.

314
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,790
These tubes of toothpaste!'

315
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:54,559
He had the three tubes in his hand, and he
looked at them.

316
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,360
Everybody could see them.

317
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:04,460
'But are they tubes of toothpaste?' he asked.

318
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:11,070
'No, men and women of the jury, they are not.

319
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,990
Oh no.

320
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,710
There is no toothpaste in these tubes.

321
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,039
There is heroin in them!

322
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:31,600
Yes, heroin... a bad, dirty drug.

323
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,809
Perhaps the worst drug.

324
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:42,039
People die from this drug.

325
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,529
The "White Death", they call it.'

326
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:50,990
The lawyer stopped, and looked at the jury.

327
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,510
He waited for a minute or two.

328
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,950
The courtroom was very quiet.

329
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,649
Then he began again.

330
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:15,140
'But why, you ask me - why did these two young
people have this heroin in their bags?

331
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,279
I can tell you.

332
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:26,610
Because heroin is one of the most expensive
drugs, too.

333
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:36,360
They can sell these tubes of heroin in our
country for perhaps eighty thousand pounds.

334
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,880
Eighty thousand pounds!

335
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,720
Easy money!

336
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:52,380
And, men and women of the jury, many people
in our country - young people, school-children,

337
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,799
too - take this drug.

338
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,700
At first it's exciting and they feel happy.

339
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:12,360
But then they need more and more heroin, and
they need more money to buy the drug.

340
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,880
They leave their homes and families.

341
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,039
They take more heroin... and more.

342
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:25,000
They can't stop.

343
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,350
Soon the drug begins to kill them.

344
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,910
And in the end they die.

345
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,190
The "White Death".

346
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:44,570
It's not a quick death, and it's not an easy
death.

347
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:56,190
Yes, men and women of the jury, many young
people and children - your children and my

348
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,139
children, remember!

349
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:03,799
- die because of this drug.'

350
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,760
The lawyer stopped again.

351
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,820
The jury watched him, and waited.

352
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,330
'He's very good,' Anna thought.

353
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,680
'Very, very good.

354
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:27,080
He's telling the jury an exciting story, and
they like him.

355
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,779
But it isn't good for Sarah.'

356
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:38,230
The lawyer walked across the courtroom and
stood in front of the jury.

357
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:48,710
'But, my friends,' he said to the jury, 'we
have a law in this country.

358
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,049
And the law is not difficult to understand.

359
00:30:53,049 --> 00:31:02,149
When people bring heroin into this country,
they bring death, too.

360
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:06,300
We need to stop these people.

361
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,029
And how can we do that?

362
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:12,350
The answer is easy.

363
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:20,139
The law for these people is death.'

364
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:23,210
The lawyer walked back to his table.

365
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:33,330
'Now please look at these two young people
here in this court,' he said to the jury.

366
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,529
'They brought heroin into this country.

367
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:43,000
The airport police are going to tell you about
it.

368
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,860
Please listen carefully.

369
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,039
It's not a long story.

370
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,539
And remember...

371
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,790
the law is death.'

372
00:31:53,790 --> 00:32:06,809
The police lawyer sat down, and an airport
policeman went to the front of the courtroom.

373
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:09,460
Anna felt ill.

374
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,430
She looked at Sarah.

375
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:17,700
Sarah was white-faced and very afraid.

376
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,550
Anna closed her eyes.

377
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:27,960
'Sarah,' she thought, 'Oh, Sarah.'

378
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,950
The police lawyer stood up again.

379
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:41,270
'Please tell the court about Sarah Harland
and Hassan,' he said to the airport policeman.

380
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,370
'Yes, sir,' said the policeman.

381
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:55,340
'I found two tubes of toothpaste in the girl's
bag, and one tube in the young man's bag.

382
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,670
All three tubes had heroin in them.'

383
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,510
'Thank you.'

384
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:13,100
The police lawyer sat down, and Mr Cheng - Sarah's
and Hassan's lawyer - stood up.

385
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:22,830
'What did Sarah Harland say when you found
the heroin?' he asked.

386
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,920
'Nothing, sir.

387
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,260
She began to cry.'

388
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,539
'I see.

389
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,700
Was she afraid?'

390
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,960
The policeman thought for a minute.

391
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,429
'I don't know, sir.

392
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,300
Perhaps she was, yes.'

393
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,490
'And she said nothing?

394
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,639
Are you sure?'

395
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:54,169
The policeman thought again.

396
00:33:54,169 --> 00:34:05,029
'Well, yes, sir, I think perhaps she said:
"This isn't my toothpaste.

397
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,299
This is all wrong."'

398
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,450
'I see.

399
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:15,800
And what about the young man, Hassan?

400
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,600
What did he say?'

401
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,290
'Well, sir, he was very angry.

402
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,450
He said: "It's not heroin.

403
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,090
That's not true!

404
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,300
You put it there!"'

405
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,900
'I see.

406
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,490
Thank you.

407
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:45,760
Now tell me, why did you look in these two
young people's bags?

408
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,880
You don't usually look in everyone's bags.

409
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,760
There isn't time.'

410
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,330
The policeman thought again.

411
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,050
'Well, no, sir, we don't.

412
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,050
I...

413
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,210
I'm afraid I can't tell you, sir.'

414
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,400
'What did you say?'

415
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,180
Mr Cheng asked, very angrily.

416
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,170
'Of course you can tell me!

417
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,980
This is a court of law!'

418
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,260
He looked at the judge.

419
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,970
'This is a very important question.

420
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,430
We need an answer!'

421
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,490
The judge looked at the airport policeman.

422
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,340
'I'm sorry,' he said.

423
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,410
'Please answer the question.

424
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,910
The court needs to know the answer.'

425
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,860
'Yes, sir.

426
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,580
Well, you see, there was a telephone call.

427
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,450
Someone telephoned me before the plane arrived.

428
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:07,590
The telephone caller said: "There's some heroin
on the plane.

429
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,960
A young man and a young woman are carrying
it."'

430
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,280
'I see,' Mr Cheng said.

431
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,830
He smiled.

432
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,180
'That's very interesting.

433
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,650
And who made this telephone call?'

434
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,910
'I don't know,' the policeman said.

435
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:39,320
'It was a man, and he talked in English.

436
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,220
I don't know his name.'

437
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,990
Suddenly Anna heard a noise.

438
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,790
She looked behind her at the door of the courtroom.

439
00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:02,860
A tall young man came into the back of the
room.

440
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,060
Anna knew him at once.

441
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:12,350
It was Stephen, Sarah's old boyfriend.

442
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:18,880
A policeman took him to a chair near Anna.

443
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,350
He saw Anna, and for a second he looked afraid.

444
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,810
But then he smiled, and sat down next to her.

445
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,840
'Mrs Harland!' he said quietly.

446
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,360
'It's good to see you.

447
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,880
When did you arrive?'

448
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,090
'Yesterday,' she said.

449
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,110
'Why are you late?'

450
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:55,450
'I couldn't find the court,' he answered.

451
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,300
He looked very unhappy.

452
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,950
'Tell me how to help,' he said.

453
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:09,180
'I want to help Sarah, but what can I do?

454
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:16,910
I was on the plane too, but I couldn't help
her.

455
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,840
I don't want her to die!'

456
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,450
'Stay with me, young man,' Anna said quietly.

457
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:35,250
'We can help her - I'm sure we can!'

458
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:43,800
Later that morning, Sarah went to the front
of the courtroom.

459
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:51,130
Her face was very white, and her eyes were
red with crying.

460
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,860
Her lawyer - Mr Cheng - began to ask her questions.

461
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:06,630
'Now, Miss Harland, why did you come to this
country?' he asked quietly, and smiled at

462
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,080
her.

463
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,250
'Because I like going to different countries.

464
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,110
I want to meet new people.'

465
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,910
'And why were you with this young man?'

466
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,100
'Because...'

467
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,970
Sarah stopped and looked down at her feet.

468
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,490
Nobody could see her face.

469
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:40,190
She began again, very quietly, but nobody
could hear her.

470
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,840
'I'm sorry.

471
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,610
We can't hear you.

472
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,580
Can you say that again, please?'

473
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,930
Sarah looked up.

474
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,990
She looked quickly at her mother, and then
at Hassan.

475
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,440
'Because I love him.'

476
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,590
Anna felt old and tired.

477
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:13,990
She looked at the tall young man with the
beautiful dark eyes.

478
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,770
'It was his heroin,' she thought.

479
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,140
'I'm sure it was.

480
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:27,860
He buys and sells heroin, and he put it in
my daughter's bag.

481
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:34,280
And now she says she loves him!'

482
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,290
Stephen sat next to her.

483
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,000
He did not move, and he watched Sarah all
the time.

484
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,740
But she did not look at him.

485
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:54,230
Mr Cheng waited a minute, and then he questioned
Sarah again.

486
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:03,960
'Did you know about the heroin in those tubes
of toothpaste?' he asked.

487
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,180
'No,' Sarah said quickly.

488
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,800
'Of course I didn't!'

489
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,470
'And what about Hassan?

490
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,750
Did he know about the heroin?

491
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,570
Please think about your answer.'

492
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,310
'No, I'm sure he didn't know.

493
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,950
It wasn't our heroin!'

494
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,020
Sarah's blue eyes were angry.

495
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,200
'We didn't put the heroin in the toothpaste
tubes.

496
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,310
We're innocent!'

497
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:50,470
'Thank you, Miss Harland,' Mr Cheng said quietly,
and sat down.

498
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,320
The police lawyer stood up.

499
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,000
'Miss Harland.

500
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
How much money did you have in your bag?'

501
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,430
'Um... about fifty pounds, I think.'

502
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,070
'That's not very much.

503
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,300
This is an expensive country, you know.

504
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:20,080
How much can you buy... with your fifty pounds?'

505
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,690
Sarah did not have an answer.

506
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,130
'Um...

507
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,560
I don't know,' she began.

508
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,220
'I usually live very cheaply...'

509
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:38,590
'Did you need more money?'

510
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,540
The lawyer's questions came quickly now.

511
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,050
'Of course you needed more money.

512
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,830
You wanted to sell that heroin.

513
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,190
You wanted to be rich.

514
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,780
Is that right?'

515
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,020
'No!

516
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,270
No!

517
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,510
That's not true!'

518
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,140
The lawyer said nothing for a minute.

519
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,870
He looked at the jury, and smiled.

520
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:18,130
Then he said, 'Do you think toothpaste is
very expensive in this country, Miss Harland?'

521
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,130
'Er...

522
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,740
no, I don't think...

523
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,800
er...

524
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,360
I don't know.'

525
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,710
'Well, I can tell you, it isn't.

526
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,890
Toothpaste is cheap here.

527
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,840
So why did you bring three tubes of toothpaste
with you?

528
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,340
How often do you clean, your teeth, Miss Harland?

529
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,250
Six times a day?

530
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,740
Or seven, or eight, times a day, perhaps?'

531
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,520
Sarah looked very unhappy.

532
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,980
'No...

533
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,640
I don't know...

534
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,830
Hassan...'

535
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,030
'Yes?'

536
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,360
the lawyer said quickly.

537
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,780
'Hassan?

538
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:08,410
Are you going to say "Hassan gave it to me"?

539
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,870
You love this young man, but you don't want
to die.

540
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,000
Nobody wants to die.

541
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And now you're going to say "It was Hassan's
toothpaste".

542
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,090
Is that your answer, Miss Harland?'

543
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,140
'No!'

544
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,660
Sarah said angrily.

545
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,470
'Of course not!

546
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,850
It was my toothpaste.

547
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:34,850
But...'

548
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,930
'Thank you, Miss Harland.'

549
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,000
The police lawyer sat down.

550
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,800
'I have no more questions.'

551
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,840
CHAPTER FOUR
At one o'clock the judge left the court for

552
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,700
an hour.

553
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,900
Anna Harland talked to Sarah for ten minutes.

554
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,680
Sarah cried at first.

555
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,720
'I don't like that police lawyer!'

556
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,670
she said.

557
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,610
'Those questions were very difficult.

558
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,250
I couldn't answer them.'

559
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:23,160
'It doesn't matter,' her mother said.

560
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,810
'Your lawyer - Mr Cheng - is very good.

561
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,080
And Stephen is here too now.

562
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,250
We're all going to help you.'

563
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,850
Sarah was angry.

564
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,000
'Don't talk to me about Stephen!'

565
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,870
she said.

566
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,660
'I don't like him.

567
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,310
I don't want to see him here!'

568
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:56,250
'But Sarah - he was your boyfriend for two
years!

569
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,910
'He wants to help you.'

570
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,480
Sarah began to cry again.

571
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,020
'Perhaps he does want to help me.

572
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,890
I don't know.

573
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:15,710
But he's different now, mother, you don't
understand.

574
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,550
His eyes are different.

575
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,550
They're...

576
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,180
I don't know.

577
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,660
And he can't sit quietly and talk to people
now.

578
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,120
His body is moving all the time.

579
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:42,140
He came to see me in our hotel the night before
we came to this country, and...

580
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,790
I didn't like him, mother!

581
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,521
Why is he here?

582
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:55,940
He doesn't love me now, and I don't love him!'

583
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:03,440
Anna listened carefully to her daughter, and
then she went to see Mr Cheng and Inspector

584
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,030
Aziz.

585
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,210
Stephen went with her.

586
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,740
'Who made that phone call to the police at
the airport?'

587
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,190
she asked.

588
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:19,520
'We need to know that!'

589
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,230
'Yes,' Mr Cheng said.

590
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,570
'That's very important.

591
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,170
Can the police tell us?'

592
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,580
'Perhaps,' the Inspector said.

593
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,220
'But it's very difficult.

594
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,150
It was not a long telephone call.

595
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,960
And the man didn't give his name.

596
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,830
Perhaps he was a policeman, and he knew about
the heroin.'

597
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,300
'Perhaps,' Mr Cheng said.

598
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:00,790
'But then, perhaps he put the heroin there.

599
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,640
And he wanted the police to find it.

600
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,990
Perhaps someone doesn't like your daughter,
Mrs Harland?'

601
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:17,290
'I don't know,' Anna said slowly.

602
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,760
'But perhaps...'

603
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,290
But then the judge came back into the courtroom,
and everybody stopped talking.

604
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:33,340
The judge then called Hassan.

605
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,130
Hassan stood up and went to the front of the
courtroom.

606
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,810
'He's a rich boy,' Anna thought.

607
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:48,880
'That shirt and those shoes are very expensive.'

608
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,930
Hassan stood there, tall and very quiet.

609
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,660
He waited for the questions.

610
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,310
He did not look afraid.

611
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:10,420
But when Mr Cheng looked at his papers and
asked the first question, Hassan closed his

612
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,200
eyes.

613
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:18,050
'Did you know about the heroin in those tubes
of toothpaste?'

614
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,990
'No, sir.'

615
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,900
'Did Sarah know?'

616
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,840
'No, sir.'

617
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,710
'Who bought the toothpaste?'

618
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:35,090
Hassan closed his eyes again for two or three
seconds.

619
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,720
Then he answered, 'I did, sir.'

620
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,730
'You did?

621
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,700
You're sure of that?'

622
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,920
'Yes, sir.

623
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,170
I'm sure.

624
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,460
I clean my teeth a lot, you see.'

625
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,720
Hassan smiled for a moment.

626
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,140
'Well, he does have very white teeth,' Anna
thought.

627
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,550
'Sarah...'

628
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,590
Hassan began.

629
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,070
Then he stopped.

630
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,000
'Yes?'

631
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,210
Again Hassan closed his eyes and waited for
a second.

632
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:26,460
Then he looked at the jury, and said very
loudly: 'Sarah did not buy the toothpaste.

633
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,100
I bought it.

634
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,800
I bought all three tubes of toothpaste.

635
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,600
It was my toothpaste.'

636
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:43,460
Anna sat up in her chair and looked carefully
at Hassan.

637
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:49,160
'That's interesting,' she thought.

638
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,110
'Perhaps he does love Sarah!'

639
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:56,000
'I see,' Mr Cheng said.

640
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,120
'And when did you first meet Sarah Harland?'

641
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,970
'About two months ago.

642
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,920
I was in Australia.

643
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,660
We were in the same hotel.

644
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:20,710
She had a... a difficult time with her boyfriend
and I helped her.'

645
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,320
Anna looked at Stephen.

646
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,340
He was very angry, and he hit the chair in
front of him with his hand.

647
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,620
'I see,' Mr Cheng said again.

648
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,750
Then he asked his next question.

649
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:45,600
'Do you usually carry a lot of money?

650
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,810
How much money did you have at the airport?'

651
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,260
'About eighty pounds, I think.

652
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,560
That's OK.

653
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:01,060
When I need more money, I get some work for
a week or two.

654
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,370
We don't need much money.'

655
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:08,880
'And do you sometimes take heroin?'

656
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,310
'No, Sir.

657
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:12,530
Never.'

658
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,960
'Thank you.

659
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,610
Stay there, please.'

660
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:23,970
Mr Cheng sat down and the police lawyer stood
up.

661
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:30,750
He smiled at Hassan, but it was not a nice
smile.

662
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,160
'Now, Hassan.

663
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,490
You bought the toothpaste, but it was in Miss
Harland's bag.

664
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,510
Why?

665
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,790
Why did she carry it for you?

666
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:51,410
Or do you always ask your women to carry things
for you?'

667
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,450
He smiled.

668
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,650
Hassan said nothing.

669
00:52:56,650 --> 00:53:01,290
The lawyer began again.

670
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:05,430
'You had eighty pounds, you say.

671
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:12,750
But eighty thousand pounds is better than
eighty pounds, I think.

672
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,350
What do you think?'

673
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,040
'Of course it is.

674
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,470
But I don't sell heroin.

675
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,930
It's wrong to sell heroin.'

676
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:31,170
The lawyer moved his papers on the table.

677
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,730
He looked at the jury.

678
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:43,820
'So you are a very good young man with very
clean teeth but no money.

679
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,370
You met a young English girl.

680
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:56,240
She was unhappy with her boyfriend, so you
helped her and took her away with you.

681
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,850
Is that right?

682
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:00,609
Oh dear!

683
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:04,940
It's not a very good story, you know.

684
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:13,960
I don't believe it, and I don't think the
jury believes it, young man.'

685
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,050
He stopped for a minute.

686
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:26,341
Then he looked at Hassan, and said loudly:
'You don't love Sarah Harland, and she doesn't

687
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:27,341
love you.

688
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:33,510
You went with her because she could help you.

689
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:40,340
And she went with you because she wanted the
money.

690
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:45,340
She carried the heroin for you to sell.

691
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,790
That's right, isn't it?

692
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:54,930
You put the heroin in the toothpaste tubes,
and she knew about it.

693
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:58,770
Is that the true story, young man?

694
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,490
I think it is.'

695
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:02,490
'No!

696
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,490
I...'

697
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,500
Hassan began angrily.

698
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,060
But the lawyer did not listen.

699
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,390
He sat down.

700
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:19,100
'I have no more questions,' he said to the
judge.

701
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:26,870
CHAPTER FIVE
The judge looked at his papers and then at

702
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,870
the jury.

703
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:34,640
'It is now four o'clock in the afternoon,'
he said.

704
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,130
'We can begin again in the morning.

705
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,750
Please be here at ten o'clock.'

706
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:49,460
The judge stood up and left the courtroom.

707
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:59,690
The jury left too, and the police took Sarah
and Hassan back to the prison.

708
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,270
Anna looked at Stephen.

709
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,260
'Well, young man,' she said.

710
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,870
'What can we do now?

711
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,610
We have sixteen hours before tomorrow morning.'

712
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:20,510
'I don't know,' Stephen said.

713
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:28,890
He looked at her for a minute, then he looked
away, over her head, at the front of the court.

714
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:34,960
'I'm sure Hassan knew about the heroin,' he
said.

715
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,070
'He put it in her bag, I'm sure he did.

716
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,150
Sarah is innocent.

717
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,270
But he isn't.'

718
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:51,010
Mr Cheng came and stood with them.

719
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:55,320
'She's innocent,' Stephen said again.

720
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,480
'But Hassan's going to die.'

721
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,560
Mr Cheng looked at Stephen carefully.

722
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,420
'Perhaps,' he said slowly.

723
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,570
'But did you listen to Hassan in court?

724
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:17,180
He said: "Sarah did not buy the toothpaste.

725
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,200
It was my toothpaste."

726
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,020
Now why did he say that?

727
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,540
It was not an easy thing to say, you know.

728
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:33,530
What is the jury going to think about it?'

729
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:39,520
'It doesn't matter,' Stephen said angrily.

730
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:47,180
'Because it wasn't toothpaste, and he didn't
buy it in a shop!

731
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:54,050
He made those tubes, because he wanted to
sell the heroin.

732
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,360
And he's going to die.

733
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,940
That's the law in this country.'

734
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,420
Anna looked at Stephen and said nothing.

735
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,140
'He's very angry,' she thought.

736
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:15,260
'His face is red and he's talking very quickly.

737
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:20,170
Does he want to kill Hassan?

738
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,910
And what's the matter with his eyes?'

739
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:28,300
Mr Cheng watched Stephen too.

740
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,130
'But who made that telephone call?

741
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,100
It's important and I want to know,' he said.

742
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,500
'I'm going to ask the police now.

743
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,290
Would you like to come with me, Mrs Harland?'

744
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,310
'Yes, of course,' Anna said.

745
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:53,660
'Stephen, are you coming?'

746
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:59,610
'Yes... er, no, no,' Stephen said.

747
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:03,010
'I'm going to meet a man.

748
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,730
I think he can help us.'

749
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:09,700
'All right,' Anna said.

750
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,190
'But when can I meet you?

751
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:16,520
I need to talk to you, about Hassan.

752
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,380
Can I come to your hotel tonight?'

753
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:27,800
'Er, no, not tonight,' Stephen said quickly.

754
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,600
His face was now white, and he looked tired
and ill.

755
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,910
His hands and body moved all the time.

756
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,140
'Come to my hotel tomorrow morning.

757
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,690
Bye!'

758
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,970
He walked quickly out of the courtroom.

759
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,230
Anna and Mr Cheng watched him.

760
00:59:52,230 --> 01:00:01,560
Inspector Aziz was near the door, and he watched
Stephen, too.

761
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:09,880
CHAPTER SIX
Anna and Mr Cheng talked to the police, but

762
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:17,980
the police could tell them nothing more about
the telephone call to the airport.

763
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:28,220
Inspector Aziz telephoned two or three people,
and then he talked to Anna again.

764
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:36,050
When Anna left Inspector Aziz, she was much
happier.

765
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,390
Then she went to the prison to see Sarah.

766
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:45,460
The man took her to Sarah's room.

767
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:52,870
Anna and Sarah sat at the table, and the man
stood and watched.

768
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,970
'It was a bad day, mother.

769
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:02,030
I'm sorry,' Sarah said slowly.

770
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:08,280
Her eyes were not red now, but she looked
very tired.

771
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,440
Her hands were near her mother's, on the table.

772
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:21,960
'It wasn't a very good day, that's true,'
Anna said.

773
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,390
'But you have a very good lawyer, you know.

774
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,420
The jury likes him.'

775
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,230
'But it doesn't help,' Sarah said.

776
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:44,810
'There was heroin in the toothpaste tubes,
and the tubes were in my bag.

777
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,210
What can Mr Cheng do?

778
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:52,800
The heroin was in my bag, mother!

779
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,430
The jury knows that!'

780
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:02,520
Anna looked at her daughter carefully.

781
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,330
'Perhaps Hassan put it there, Sarah,' she
said.

782
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:13,340
'You like him, I know, and he looks nice,
but...'

783
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,680
'Mother, I love him!

784
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,390
I said that in court.

785
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,890
You heard me.

786
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:25,890
And Hassan loves me, too!

787
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:30,460
And he does not buy or sell heroin!

788
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,220
I...'

789
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,650
Sarah stopped talking, and put her hands on
her stomach.

790
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,990
'What's the matter?'

791
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,040
Anna asked.

792
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
She looked at the man.

793
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
'Quickly - she's ill.

794
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,040
Get a doctor!'

795
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:55,640
The man ran from the room, and Anna put her
arms round her daughter.

796
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:00,920
She waited, and then Sarah sat up.

797
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,780
'It's all right, mother,' she said.

798
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:09,940
Her face was very white, but she looked a
little better.

799
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,770
'It happens sometimes.

800
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:19,000
I often feel ill, and I don't like to eat
much.

801
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,110
But it's not very bad.

802
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:27,470
I think I'm going to stay alive because of
it.'

803
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,420
She gave her mother a smile.

804
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,870
'What?

805
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,200
What are you saying?

806
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,820
What are you talking about?'

807
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,990
Anna cried.

808
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,990
'My baby.'

809
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:50,770
Sarah's face looked different now - half smiling,
half afraid.

810
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,869
'Mother, don't be angry, please.

811
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:57,760
I'm going to have a baby.

812
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,860
It's Hassan's baby.

813
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:09,490
I... we wanted to come to England, and tell
you about it there, but now we can't.

814
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:15,530
I love him, and he wants to be my husband,
mother.

815
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,810
Mother?

816
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:21,670
Please don't be angry.'

817
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:23,970
Anna's face was white now.

818
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:29,000
For nearly a minute she could say nothing.

819
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,810
She wanted to cry, but she didn't.

820
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:41,110
At last she said, 'Oh, Sarah!

821
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:46,350
What's going to happen to this baby?'

822
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,880
Sarah looked at her hands.

823
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,640
'Nothing, mother.

824
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,770
I asked Mr Cheng about that.

825
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:02,520
They can't kill me, you see, because I'm going
to have a baby.

826
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,040
They can't kill a mother and her baby.

827
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,160
That's the law.

828
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:14,810
But... that doesn't help Hassan.'

829
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,030
Anna heard a noise and looked at the door.

830
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,100
'Listen, Sarah,' she said quickly.

831
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,750
'Before the doctor comes...

832
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:31,530
I'm not angry, and I do love you, Sarah, of
course.

833
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:33,010
But listen.

834
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,830
I talked to Inspector Aziz again today.

835
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:42,520
I think he can help you - and Hassan too.

836
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:46,560
So don't be afraid, please.

837
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,720
And...'

838
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,810
The door opened, and the man came in with
a woman doctor.

839
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,950
Anna stood up.

840
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,450
She took Sarah's hand.

841
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,240
'I'm going now, Sarah.

842
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,730
But don't be afraid.

843
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:11,800
You're going to be all right - I'm sure of
it!'

844
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:19,850
CHAPTER SEVEN
Next morning, at half past four, Anna Harland

845
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:25,490
stood in a quiet road in front of a hotel.

846
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:32,700
She waited, and then she heard a car behind
the hotel.

847
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:37,700
The car doors opened and closed.

848
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:43,780
She waited quietly, and then looked down the
road.

849
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:50,010
A man walked into the road and stood next
to a shop.

850
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,570
He did not look at Anna.

851
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:57,510
But Anna looked at him, and smiled.

852
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:02,530
Then she walked into the hotel.

853
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:07,420
She went upstairs and knocked on the door
of a bedroom.

854
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,620
A man answered.

855
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,970
'Who is it?'

856
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:14,880
'It's me, Stephen,' she said.

857
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,450
'Anna Harland.

858
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,010
Open the door, please.

859
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:22,430
I want to talk to you.'

860
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:26,430
The door opened, and Stephen looked out slowly.

861
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,430
'Anna?

862
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:33,210
What are you doing here at this time?

863
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:34,210
It's...'

864
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,180
Anna walked quickly into the room.

865
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,290
'Yes.

866
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,740
It's half past four.

867
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:44,530
Sarah is in court again at ten o'clock.

868
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,200
I need your help, young man.

869
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,220
Please get up.'

870
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,220
'But...

871
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,880
what can I do?'

872
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,310
Anna looked at him.

873
01:07:55,310 --> 01:08:00,470
'You went to see a man last night.

874
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,940
What happened?

875
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,410
Can he help Sarah?'

876
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:09,060
Stephen answered slowly.

877
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,850
He did not look at Anna.

878
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:13,580
'No.

879
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,130
I'm sorry.

880
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:17,800
He can't.'

881
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,170
Anna was cold and angry.

882
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:23,650
'I see,' she said.

883
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:27,060
'Well, can you and I help her then?

884
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:33,620
Tell me, Stephen, what do you know about Hassan?'

885
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,900
'Hassan?'

886
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,090
Stephen said angrily.

887
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:45,540
'Well, we met him in Australia, and Sarah
went away with him.

888
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:54,859
She doesn't understand him, but I do - he's
a rich young man with a beautiful body.

889
01:08:54,859 --> 01:09:02,299
He likes playing with girls, but he doesn't
love her!'

890
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:07,250
'And do you love her, Stephen?'

891
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,730
Stephen did not answer at once.

892
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:13,910
For two or three seconds Anna waited.

893
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:17,720
'He doesn't know,' she thought.

894
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,880
'He can't answer the question.'

895
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,540
'Yes, Mrs Harland.

896
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,980
Of course I love her.'

897
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:32,420
'But he's not looking at me,' Anna thought.

898
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,670
'He's looking out of the window.

899
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,240
He's not thinking about Sarah.'

900
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:48,290
'Stephen,' Anna asked quietly, 'did you go
to see Sarah and Hassan in Australia, the

901
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:53,180
night before they came to this country?'

902
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,150
Stephen looked up at her.

903
01:09:55,150 --> 01:10:00,990
'Er... yes, I went to their hotel,' he said.

904
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:05,880
'I asked Sarah to leave Hassan and come back
to me.

905
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,160
But how did you know that?'

906
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,350
'Sarah told me, of course.

907
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:16,460
Was Hassan there?'

908
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:17,890
'No.

909
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,330
He...'

910
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:20,330
Stephen stopped.

911
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:26,060
Then he said, 'Why do you ask?'

912
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,180
Anna opened her handbag.

913
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,730
'Look at this,' she said.

914
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,110
'What is it?

915
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,850
Do you know?'

916
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:40,420
He looked at it, and then at Anna.

917
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,510
'A tube of toothpaste.

918
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:43,600
Why?'

919
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,790
'That's right.

920
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:49,980
A policeman gave it to me.

921
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,390
And he took it from a man.

922
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:57,790
You met that man last night, Stephen.

923
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:02,670
You gave him ten tubes of toothpaste.

924
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:08,850
What was in those tubes of toothpaste, Stephen?'

925
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,350
Stephen said nothing.

926
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,580
He looked at the toothpaste, and stood up.

927
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,140
But Anna was between him and the door.

928
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,930
She gave the toothpaste to him.

929
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:26,800
'Would you like to clean your teeth, Stephen?'

930
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,890
He began to move to the door, but Anna took
his arm.

931
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:37,300
'You don't love Sarah, do you, Stephen?

932
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,560
You hate her, because she left you!

933
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:49,600
You put three of these tubes in Sarah's bag,
and then you phoned the police.

934
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,350
You told them about the tubes in my daughter's
bag...

935
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,150
You want Sarah to die!'

936
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,730
'No!'

937
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,730
Stephen said.

938
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,590
'No, no... not Sarah...

939
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:03,590
Hassan!

940
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:08,790
I put them in Hassan's bag, not Sarah's.

941
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:12,590
I wanted Hassan to die!'

942
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:16,200
He opened the door quickly, and then stopped.

943
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:23,060
A man stood there - Inspector Aziz.

944
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,270
He put his hand on Stephen's arm.

945
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,580
'It's an old story, young man,' he said.

946
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,560
'It happens every day.

947
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,880
My first girlfriend left me for a new man.

948
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,550
I was very angry too.

949
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:44,470
I hated him.

950
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,930
But I didn't want to kill him.

951
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,040
Come on.

952
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,150
Let's go.

953
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:59,440
You can tell your story to the judge.'

954
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,830
CHAPTER EIGHT
At eleven o'clock that morning, Sarah and

955
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:10,080
Hassan were free.

956
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:16,460
Sarah stood with her mother, Inspector Aziz,
and Mr Cheng.

957
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,740
She smiled happily.

958
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:23,380
'Mother, you're wonderful!

959
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:26,000
Now I can be happy!

960
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,730
But...

961
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:32,480
how did you know about Stephen?'

962
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,080
Inspector Aziz answered.

963
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,100
'Young woman,' he said.

964
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:43,810
'Remember, your mother is a doctor.

965
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:51,270
She knew Stephen was ill because of his eyes,
and his body.

966
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:58,590
His eyes are very big and dark, and his body
is always moving...'

967
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:03,560
'Well, yes,' Anna said.

968
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,130
'But you helped me, Sarah.

969
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:11,810
You said he was different - remember?

970
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:17,910
And I looked at him carefully, and began to
think.

971
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:22,440
Heroin does that to people.'

972
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:32,610
'He did a very bad thing,' Sarah said slowly,
'but I feel sorry for him now.

973
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:35,990
When is he going to court, Inspector?'

974
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:40,450
'I don't know,' the Inspector said.

975
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,310
'In two weeks, perhaps.

976
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,110
But don't think about him.

977
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:52,160
Would you like to see our beautiful country,
Mrs Harland?

978
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,740
Where would you like to go?'

979
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,460
Anna smiled at him.

980
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,090
'Thank you.

981
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:02,360
But I can't stay.

982
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:10,460
Tomorrow, I'm going back to England, to talk
to Stephen's mother and father.'

983
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:17,130
Inspector Aziz looked at her, and said nothing
for a minute.

984
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:20,120
Then he said quietly: 'Yes.

985
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,500
I feel very sorry for them.

986
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:29,920
It kills a lot of young people, this heroin.'

987
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,210
'Yes.

988
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:35,690
But it isn't going to kill my daughter.

989
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:39,810
She isn't going to die now.'

990
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:41,900
Anna took Sarah's hand.

991
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:49,060
'So thank you again, Inspector Aziz and Mr
Cheng.

992
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:51,400
And goodbye.

993
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:59,960
Now I'm going to have a long cold drink in
a quiet garden with my daughter and her new

994
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,860
young man.

995
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:06,400
I want to know a lot more about him.'

996
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,940
Hassan stood with his mother and father near
the door of the court.

997
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:19,230
Anna Harland put her hand on her daughter's
arm, and smiled at them.

998
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:19,440
- THE END -
