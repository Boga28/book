00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:08,360
CHAPTER ONE
As a child I had been impressed by the Boerum

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,640
House.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,370
It was fairly new then, and shiny with new
paint - a huge Victorian building.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,240
Standing in front of it this early Christmas
Eve, however, I could find no echo of that

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,420
youthful impression.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,150
It was all a depressing gray now, and the
curtains behind the windows were drawn completely

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,210
so that the house seemed to present blindly
staring eyes to the passerby.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,480
When I knocked my stick sharply on the door,
Celia opened it.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,130
'There is a doorbell,' she said.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,210
She was still wearing the long unfashionable
and badly wrinkled black dress which must

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,600
have been her mother's, and she looked more
than ever like old Katrin had in her later

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,140
years: the thin bony body, the tight thin
line of her lips, the colorless hair pulled

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,570
back hard enough to remove every wrinkle from
her forehead.

14
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,799
She reminded me of a steel trap ready to shut
down on anyone who touched her incautiously.

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,689
I said, 'I am aware that the doorbell is not
connected, Celia,' and walked past her into

16
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,649
the hall.

17
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,999
She banged the door shut, and instantly we
were in half-darkness.

18
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:31,840
I put out my hand for the light switch, but
Celia said sharply, 'This is no time for lights!

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,810
There's been a death in this house, you know
that.'

20
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,819
'I have good reason to know,' I said, 'but
your manner now does not impress me.'

21
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,560
'She was my brother's wife, and very dear
to me.'

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,590
I moved towards her and rested my stick on
her shoulder.

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,390
'Celia,' I said, 'as your family's lawyer,
let me give you a word of advice.

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,369
The inquest is over, and you've been cleared.

25
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:06,310
But nobody believed you then, and nobody ever
will.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,580
Remember that.'

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,780
She pulled away.

28
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,310
'Is that what you came to tell me?'

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,780
'I came because I knew your brother would
want to see me today.

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,860
I suggest you keep away while I talk to him.'

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,540
'Keep away from him yourself!'

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
she cried.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,830
'He was at the inquest and saw them clear
my name.

34
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,430
In a little while he'll forget the terrible
things he thinks about me.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,530
Keep away from him so that he can forget.'

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,970
I started walking cautiously up the dark stairs,
but she followed me.

37
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,080
'I prayed,' she said, 'and was told that life
is too short for hatred.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,860
So when he comes to me, I'll forgive him.'

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,850
I reached the top of the stairs and almost
fell over something.

40
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,250
I swore, then said, 'If you're not going to
use lights, you should at least keep the way

41
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,250
clear.

42
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,890
Why don't you get these things out of here?'

43
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,790
'They are poor Jessie's things,' she said.

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,640
'Ready for throwing out.

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,500
It hurts Charlie to see anything of hers.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,900
I knew it would be best to throw them out.'

47
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,200
Alarm came into her voice.

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,620
'But you won't tell him, will you?'

49
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,150
I went into Charlie's room and closed the
door behind me.

50
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,900
The curtains were drawn, but the ceiling light
showed me that he was lying on his bed with

51
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,319
an arm over his eyes.

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,570
Slowly, he stood up and looked at me.

53
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:49,440
'Well,' he said at last, nodding towards the
door, she didn't give you any light on the

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,550
way up, did she?'

55
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,780
'No,' I said, 'but I know the way.'

56
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,940
'She gets around better in the dark than I
do in the light.

57
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,830
She'd rather have it that way, too.

58
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,920
Otherwise she might look into a mirror and
be frightened of what she saw.'

59
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,330
He gave a short laugh.

60
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,469
'All you hear from her now is how she loved
Jessie, and how sorry she is.

61
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:24,810
Maybe she thinks if she says if often enough,
people will believe it.'

62
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,479
I dropped my hat and stick on the bed and
put my overcoat beside them.

63
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,190
Then I took out a cigarette and waited until
he found a match to light it for me.

64
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,930
His hand shook violently.

65
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,919
Charlie was five years younger than Celia,
but seeing him then I thought he looked ten

66
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,029
years older.

67
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:52,430
His hair was so fair that it was difficult
to see whether or not he was going gray.

68
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,710
He had not shaved for several days, and there
were huge blue-black bags under his eyes.

69
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,259
He stared at me, pulling uncertainly at his
mustache.

70
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,240
'You know why I wanted to see you,' he said.

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,039
'I can imagine,' I said, 'but I'd rather you
told me.'

72
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,300
'It's Celia,' he said.

73
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,190
'I want her to get what she deserves.

74
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,580
Not prison.

75
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,849
I want the law to take her and kill her, and
I want to be there to watch it.'

76
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:36,020
'You were at the inquest, Charlie,' I said.

77
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,900
'You saw what happened.

78
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,969
Celia's cleared and, unless more evidence
can be produced, she stays cleared.'

79
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,449
'What more evidence does anyone need?

80
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,320
They were arguing violently at the top of
the stairs.

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,319
Celia threw Jessie down to the bottom and
killed her.

82
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,880
That's murder, isn't it?'

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,330
I was tired, and sat down in the old leather
armchair.

84
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,640
'There were no witnesses,' I said.

85
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,720
'I heard Jessie scream and I heard her fall,'
he said, 'and when I ran out and found her

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,240
there, I heard Celia bang her door shut.

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,669
She pushed Jessie!'

88
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,710
'But you didn't see anything.

89
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,629
And Celia says she wasn't there.

90
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:35,319
As you weren't an eyewitness, you can't make
a murder out of what might have been an accident.'

91
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,969
He slowly shook his head.

92
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,089
'You don't really believe that,' he said.

93
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:48,219
'Because if you do, you can get out now and
never come near me again.'

94
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,719
'It doesn't matter what I believe.

95
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,449
I'm telling you the legal position.

96
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,279
What about motive?

97
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,189
What did Celia have to gain from Jessie's
death?

98
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:02,650
There's no money or property involved.'

99
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,360
Charlie sat down on the edge of his bed.

100
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,559
'No,' he whispered, 'there's no money or property
in it.

101
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,289
It's me.

102
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:19,470
First, it was the old lady with her heart
trouble whenever I tried to do anything for

103
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,129
myself.

104
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,939
Then when she died and I thought I was free,
it was Celia.

105
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:32,349
She never had a husband or a baby - but she
had me!'

106
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:33,879
'She's your sister, Charlie.

107
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,919
She loves you.'

108
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,729
He laughed unpleasantly.

109
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,159
'And she can't let me go.

110
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,180
When I think back now, I still can't understand
how she did it.

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,479
She would look at me in a certain way and
all the strength would go out of me.

112
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,990
And it was like that until I met Jessie ... I
remember the day I brought Jessie home, and

113
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,599
told Celia we were married.

114
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,949
There was a look in her eye - the same look
that must have been there when she pushed

115
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,939
Jessie down those stairs.'

116
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,379
I said, 'But you admitted at the inquest that
you never saw her threaten or do anything

117
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,969
to hurt Jessie.'

118
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,430
'Of course I never saw!

119
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,439
But Jessie would go around sick to her heart
every day without saying a Word, and would

120
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,470
cry in bed every night and not tell me why.

121
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,210
I knew what was going on.

122
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,200
I talked to her and I talked to Celia, and
both of them just shook their heads.

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,490
But when I saw Jessie lying there, it didn't
surprise me at all.'

124
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:54,440
'I don't think it surprised anyone who knows
Celia,' I said, 'but that isn't evidence.'

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,410
He beat his hand against his knee.

126
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,540
'What can I do?

127
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,060
That's what I need you to tell me.

128
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,670
All my life I've never done anything because
of her.

129
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,340
And that's what she expects now - that I won't
do anything, and that she'll get away with

130
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,440
it.'

131
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,620
He stood up and stared at the door, then at
me.

132
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,670
'But I can do something,' he whispered.

133
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,690
'Do you know what?'

134
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,070
I stood up facing him and shook my head.

135
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,100
'Whatever you're thinking, put it out of your
mind,' I said.

136
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,510
'Don't confuse me,' he said.

137
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,820
'You know you can get away with murder if
you're as clever as Celia.

138
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,030
Don't you think I'm as clever as Celia?'

139
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,060
I held his shoulders.

140
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,710
'Don't talk like that, Charlie!'

141
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,080
He pulled away.

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,450
His eyes were bright and his teeth showed
behind his lips.

143
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,140
'What should I do?' he cried.

144
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,390
'Forget everything now Jessie is dead and
buried?

145
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,990
Sit here until Celia gets tired of being afraid
of me and kills me too?'

146
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,760
'You haven't been out of this house since
the inquest,' I said.

147
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,370
'It's about time you went out.'

148
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,260
'And have everybody laugh at me!' he said.

149
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,030
'Al Sharp said that some of your friends would
be at his bar tonight, and he'd like to see

150
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,920
you there,' I said.

151
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,740
'That's my advice - for whatever it's worth.'

152
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,530
'It's not worth anything,' said Celia.

153
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,660
The door had opened and she stood there, her
eyes narrowed against the light in the room.

154
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,030
Charlie turned towards her.

155
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,890
'I told you never to come into this room!'
he said.

156
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,470
Her face remained calm.

157
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,060
'I'm not in it.

158
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,820
I came to tell you that your dinner is ready.'

159
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,040
He took a threatening step towards her.

160
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,700
'Did you have your ear at the door long enough
to hear everything I said?' he asked.

161
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,070
'Or shall I repeat it for you?'

162
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,800
'I heard an invitation to go drinking while
this house is still in mourning,' she said,

163
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,720
'and I object to that.'

164
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,410
He looked at her, amazed.

165
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,320
'Celia, tell me you don't mean that!

166
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,220
Only the blackest hypocrite alive or someone
mad could say what you've just said, and mean

167
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,340
it.'

168
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,470
'Mad!'

169
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,470
she cried.

170
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,519
'You dare use that word?

171
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,390
Locked in your room, talking to yourself.'

172
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,550
She turned to me suddenly.

173
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,550
'You've talked to him.

174
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,680
Is it possible-?'

175
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,930
'He's as sane as you, Celia,' I said.

176
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,130
'Then he knows he shouldn't drink in bars
at a time like this.

177
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,980
How could you ask him to do this?'

178
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,940
'If you weren't preparing to throw out Jessie's
things, Celia,' I said, 'I would take that

179
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,530
question seriously.'

180
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,300
It was a dangerous thing to say, and I immediately
regretted it.

181
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,980
Before I could move, Charlie was past me and
was holding Celia's arms tightly.

182
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,500
'Did you dare go into her room?' he shouted,
shaking her.

183
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,340
And getting an immediate answer from her face,
he dropped her arms as if they were red hot,

184
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,720
and stood there with his head down.

185
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,060
'Where are her things?'

186
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,410
'By the stairs, Charlie.

187
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,320
Everything is there.'

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,180
He walked out of the room, and Celia turned
to look at me.

189
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,230
There was such terrible hatred in her face
that I desperately wanted to get out of that

190
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,820
house.

191
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,500
I took my things from the bed, but she stood
in front of the door.

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,780
'Do you see what you've done?'

193
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,070
she said in a rough whisper.

194
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,090
'Now I will have to pack them all again - just
because of you.

195
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,480
You old fool!

196
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,170
It should have been you with her when I-'

197
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,970
I dropped my stick sharply on her shoulder.

198
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,291
'As your lawyer, Celia,' I said, 'I advise
you to speak only during your sleep, when

199
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,460
you can't be made responsible for what you
say.'

200
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,200
She said no more, but I made sure she stayed
safely in front of me until I was out in the

201
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
street again.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,060
It was only a few minutes walk to Al Sharp's
bar, and I was grateful for the clear winter

203
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,400
air in my face.

204
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,890
Al was alone behind the bar, polishing glasses.

205
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,990
'Merry Christmas,' he said, and put a comfortable-looking
bottle and two glasses on the bar.

206
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,660
'I was expecting you.'

207
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,850
Al poured two drinks.

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,360
We drank, and he leaned across the bar.

209
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,130
'Just come from there?'

210
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,180
'Yes,' I said.

211
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,220
'See Charlie?'

212
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,290
'And Celia,' I said.

213
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,940
'I've seen her too when she goes by to do
some shopping,' he said.

214
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,820
'Runs along with her head down, as if she's
being chased by something.

215
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,080
And I guess she is.'

216
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,570
'I guess she is, too,' I said.

217
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,470
'Did you tell Charlie I'd like to see him
some time?'

218
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,450
'Yes,' I said.

219
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,230
'I told him!'

220
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,700
'What did he say?'

221
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
'Nothing.

222
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,380
Celia said it was wrong for him to come here
while he was in mourning.'

223
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:37,090
Al whistled softly, and moved a finger in
circles at his forehead in a silent, 'crazy!'.

224
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,630
'Tell me,' he said, 'do you think it's safe
for them to be alone together?

225
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:50,460
The way things are, the way Charlie feels,
there could be more trouble there.'

226
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,870
'It looked like that for a while tonight,'
I said.

227
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,870
'But then it calmed down.'

228
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,280
'Until the next time,' said Al.

229
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,170
'I'll be there,' I said.

230
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,760
Al looked at me and shook his head.

231
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,950
'Nothing changes in that house,' he said.

232
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,330
'That's how you can work out all the answers.

233
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,140
That's how I knew you'd be standing here now
talking to me about it.'

234
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,050
I could still smell the dampness of the house,
and I knew it would take days to get it out

235
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,770
of my clothes.

236
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,130
'This is one day I'd like to take out of the
year permanently,' I said.

237
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,540
'And leave them alone with their problems,'
agreed Al.

238
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,560
'They're not alone,' I said.

239
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,100
'Jessie is with them.

240
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,420
Jessie will always be with them until that
house and everything in it is gone.'

241
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,860
Al frowned.

242
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,240
'It's the strangest thing that ever happened
in this town.

243
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,800
The house all black, her running through the
streets like something hunted, him lying there

244
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,690
in that room with only the walls to look at,
for -how long?

245
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,290
When was it Jessie had that fall?'

246
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:18,290
By moving my eyes a little I could see my
face in the mirror behind Al: red, deeply

247
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,450
lined, a little amazed.

248
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,860
'Twenty years,' I heard myself saying.

249
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,089
'Just twenty years ago tonight.'

250
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:28,110
- THE END -
