1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Rapacini's Daughter

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,940
Many years ago a young man named Giovanni
Guasconti left his home in Naples to study

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,519
in Northern Italy.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:19,100
He rented a small room on the top floor of
a dark and ancient palace.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,539
Long ago the building had belonged to a noble
family.

6
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:34,420
Now an old woman, Seniora Lisabetta rented
its rooms to students at the University of

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,260
Padua.

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,379
Giovanni's room had a small window.

9
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:47,440
From it he could see a large garden that had
many plants and flowers.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:55,340
"Does the garden belong to you?" he asked
Seniora Lisabetta one day.

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,360
"Oh, no," she said quickly.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,280
"That garden belongs to the famous doctor
Giacomo Rapacini.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,090
People say he uses those plants to make strange
kinds of medicine.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,250
He lives in that small brown house in the
garden with his daughter Beatrice."

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,280
Giovanni often sat by his window to look at
the garden.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,040
He had never seen so many different kinds
of plants.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:37,119
They all had enormous green leaves and magnificent
flowers in every color of the rainbow.

18
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,689
Giovanni's favorite plant was in a white marble
vase near the house.

19
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,780
It was covered with big purple flowers.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:57,270
One day when Giovanni was looking out his
window he saw an old man in a black cape walking

21
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,100
in the garden.

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,510
The old man was tall and thin.

23
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,300
His face was an unhealthy yellow color.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,840
His black eyes were very cold.

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,540
The old man wore thick gloves on his hands
and a mask over his mouth and nose.

26
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,890
He walked carefully among the plants as if
he were walking among wild animals or poisonous

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,360
snakes.

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:40,990
Although he looked at the flowers very closely
he did not touch or smell any of them.

29
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:48,390
When the old man arrived at the plant with
the big purple flowers he stopped.

30
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:55,970
He took off his mask and called loudly, "Beatrice!

31
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,580
Come help me!"

32
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,099
"I'm coming, Father.

33
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,040
What do you want?"

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,620
answered a warm young voice from inside the
house.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,620
A young woman came into the garden.

36
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,569
Her thick dark hair fell around her shoulders
in curls.

37
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:22,720
Her cheeks were pink, and her eyes were large
and black.

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,710
She seemed full of life, health and energy
as she walked along the plants.

39
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:37,170
Giovanni thought she was as beautiful as the
purple flowers in the marble vase.

40
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,680
The old man said something to her.

41
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,870
She nodded her head as she touched and smelled
the flowers that her father had been so careful

42
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,269
to avoid.

43
00:03:53,269 --> 00:04:00,909
Several weeks later Giovanni went to visit
Pietro Baglioni, a friend of his father's.

44
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,400
Professor Baglioni taught medicine at the
University.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,650
During the visit Giovanni asked about Dr.
Rapacini.

46
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,400
"He is a great scientist," Professor Baglioni
replied.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,630
"But he is also a dangerous man."

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,989
"Why?"

49
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:24,710
asked Giovanni.

50
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,830
The older man shook his head slowly.

51
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:36,430
"Because Rapacini cares more about science
than he does about people.

52
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,699
He has created many terrible poisons from
the plants in his garden.

53
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,800
He thinks he can cure sickness with these
poisons.

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:56,410
It is true, and several times he has cured
a very sick person that everyone thought would

55
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,410
die.

56
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,389
But Rapacini's medicine has also killed many
people.

57
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:11,940
I think he would sacrifice any life, even
his own, for one of his experiments."

58
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,340
"But, what about his daughter?"

59
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,360
Giovanni said.

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,250
"I'm sure he loves her."

61
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,260
The old professor smiled at the young man.

62
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,520
"So," he said, "you have heard about Beatrice
Rapacini.

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,490
People say she is very beautiful.

64
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,210
But few men in Padua have ever seen her.

65
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,330
She never leaves her father's garden."

66
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,560
Giovanni left Professor Baglioni's house as
the sun was setting.

67
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,140
On his way home he stopped at a flower shop
where he bought some fresh flowers.

68
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,610
He returned to his room and sat by the window.

69
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,960
There the little sunlight was left.

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,530
The garden was quiet.

71
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:15,980
The purple flowers on Giovanni's favorite
plant seemed to glow in the evening's fading

72
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,810
light.

73
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:25,350
Then someone came out of the doorway of the
little brown house.

74
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,080
It was Beatrice.

75
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,020
She entered the garden and walked along the
plants.

76
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,280
She bent to touch the leaves of a plant or
to smell a flower.

77
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,490
Rapacini's daughter seemed to grow more beautiful
with each step.

78
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:52,280
When she reached the purple plant she burled
her face in its flowers.

79
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,539
Giovanni heard her say, "Give me your breath,
my sister.

80
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,120
The ordinary air makes me weak.

81
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,710
And give me one of your beautiful flowers."

82
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,300
Beatrice gently broke off one of the largest
flowers.

83
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:18,789
As she lifted it to put it in her dark hair
a few drops of liquid from the flower fell

84
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,520
to the ground.

85
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,660
One of the drops landed on the head of a tiny
lizard crawling near the feet of Beatrice.

86
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,099
For a moment the small animal twisted violently.

87
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,740
Then, it moved no more.

88
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,660
Beatrice did not seem surprised.

89
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,370
She sighed and placed the flower in her hair.

90
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,449
Giovanni leaned out of the window so he'd
see her better.

91
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,860
At this moment a beautiful butterfly flew
over the garden wall.

92
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,379
It seemed to be attracted by Beatrice and
flew once around her head.

93
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:17,660
Then the insect's bright wings stopped and
it fell to the ground dead.

94
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,380
Beatrice shook her head sadly.

95
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,229
Suddenly, she looked up to Giovanni's window.

96
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,500
She saw the young man looking at her.

97
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,150
Giovanni picked up the flowers he had bought
and threw them down to her.

98
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,250
"Young lady," he said.

99
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,040
"Wear these flowers as a gift from Giovanni
Guasconti."

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,430
"Thank you," Beatrice answered.

101
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,769
She picked up the flowers from the ground
and quickly ran to the house.

102
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,430
She stopped at the door for a moment to wave
shyly at Giovanni.

103
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:13,730
It seemed to him that his flowers were beginning
to turn brown in her hands.

104
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,400
For many days the young man stayed away from
the window that looked out in Rapacini's garden.

105
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,740
He wished he'd not talked to Beatrice.

106
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,450
Because now he felt under the power of her
beauty.

107
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,320
He was a little afraid of her too.

108
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,550
He could not forget how the little lizard
and the butterfly had died.

109
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,600
One day while he was returning home from his
classes he met Professor Baglioni on the street.

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,230
"Well, Giovanni," the old man said.

111
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,690
"Have you forgotten me?"

112
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,670
Then he looked closely at the young man.

113
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,779
"What is wrong, my friend?

114
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,750
Your appearance has changed since the last
time we met."

115
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,209
It was true, Giovanni had become very thin.

116
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:21,310
His face was white and his eyes seemed to
burn with fever.

117
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:28,190
As they stood talking a man dressed in a long
black cape came down the street.

118
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,310
He moved slowly like a person in poor health.

119
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,070
His face was yellow but his eyes were sharp
and black.

120
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,860
It was the man Giovanni had seen in the garden.

121
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:55,920
As he passed them the old man nodded coldly
to Professor Baglioni, but he looked at Giovanni

122
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,820
with a great deal of interest.

123
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:08,970
"It's Dr. Rapacini," Professor Baglioni whispered
after the old man had passed them.

124
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,580
"Has he ever seen your face before?"

125
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,870
Giovanni shook his head.

126
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,850
"No," he answered.

127
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,550
"I don't think so."

128
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,990
Professor Baglioni looked worried.

129
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,040
"I think he has seen you before.

130
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,610
I know that cold look of his.

131
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:38,390
He looks the same way when he examines an
animal he has killed in one of his experiments.

132
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:50,290
Giovanni, I will bet my life on it, you are
the subject of one of Rapacini's experiments."

133
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,110
Giovanni stepped away from the old man.

134
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,380
"You are Joking," he said.

135
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,480
"No, I'm serious."

136
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
The professor took Giovanni's arm.

137
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,260
"Be careful, my young friend.

138
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,829
You are in great danger."

139
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:13,899
Giovanni pulled his arm away.

140
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,320
"I must be going," he said.

141
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,120
"Good night."

142
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,430
As Giovanni hurried to his room he felt confused
and a little frightened.

143
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:33,490
Seniora Lisabetta was waiting for him outside
his door.

144
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,050
She knew he was interested in Beatrice.

145
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,270
"I have good news for you," she said.

146
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:49,370
"I know where there is a secret entrance into
Rapacini's garden."

147
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,600
Giovanni could not believe his ears.

148
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,459
"Where is it?" he asked.

149
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,980
"Show me the way!"

150
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
He went in.

151
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:10,330
The plants all seemed wild and unnatural.

152
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,899
Giovanni realized that Rapacini must have
created these strange and terrible flowers

153
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,990
through his experiments.

154
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,700
Suddenly, Rapacini's daughter came into the
garden.

155
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,579
She moved quickly among the flowers until
she reached him.

156
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,560
Giovanni apologized for coming into the garden
without an invitation.

157
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,470
But Beatrice smiled at him and made him feel
welcome.

158
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:49,180
"I see you love flowers," she said.

159
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,399
"And so you have come to take a closer look
at my father's rare collection."

160
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:05,800
While she spoke Giovanni noticed a perfume
in the air around her.

161
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:15,260
He wasn't sure if this wonderful smell came
from the flowers or from her breath.

162
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,160
She asked him about his home and his family.

163
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,149
She told him she had spent her life in this
garden.

164
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:32,040
Giovanni felt as if he were talking to a very
small child.

165
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,260
Her spirits sparkled like clear water.

166
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,240
They walked slowly through the garden as they
talked.

167
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,670
At last, they reached a beautiful plant that
was covered with large purple flowers.

168
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:59,630
He realized that the perfume from those flowers
was like the perfume of Beatrice's breath,

169
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,709
but much stronger.

170
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:09,230
The young man reached out to break off one
of the purple flowers, but Beatrice gave a

171
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,240
scream that went through his heart like a
knife.

172
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,570
She caught his hand and pulled it away from
the plant with all her strength.

173
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,839
"Don't ever touch those flowers!"

174
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,839
she cried.

175
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,730
"They will take your life."

176
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,230
Hiding her face she ran into the house.

177
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:42,930
Then Giovanni saw Dr. Rapacini standing in
the garden.

178
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:51,480
That night Giovanni could not stop thinking
about how sweet and beautiful Beatrice was.

179
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,800
Finally, he fell asleep.

180
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,740
But, when the morning came he woke up in great
pain.

181
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,210
He felt as if one of his hands was on fire.

182
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:13,649
It was the hand that Beatrice had grabbed
in hers when he had reached for one of the

183
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:16,860
purple flowers.

184
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,230
Giovanni looked down at his hand.

185
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:28,730
There was a purple mark on it that looked
like four small fingers and a little thumb.

186
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:40,190
But, because his heart was full of Beatrice
Giovanni forgot about the pain in his hand.

187
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,970
He began to meet her in the garden every day.

188
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,970
At last she told him that she loved him.

189
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,529
But she would never let him kiss her or even
hold her hand.

190
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:02,899
One morning several weeks later Professor
Baglioni visited Giovanni.

191
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,580
"I was worried about you," the older man said.

192
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:16,370
"You have not come to your classes at the
University for more than a month.

193
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,660
Is something wrong?"

194
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,020
Giovanni was not pleased to see his old friend.

195
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,980
"No, nothing is wrong.

196
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,669
I am fine, thank you."

197
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:37,850
He wanted Professor Baglioni to leave, but
the old man took off his hat and sat down.

198
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:49,330
"My dear Giovanni," he said, "you must stay
away from Rapacini and his daughter.

199
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,760
Her father has given her poison from the time
she was a baby.

200
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,620
The 'poison is in her blood and on her breath.

201
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:10,650
If Rapacini did this to his own daughter what
is he planning to do to you?"

202
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,310
Giovanni covered his face with his hands.

203
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,270
"Oh, my god!" he cried.

204
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,120
"Don't worry," the old man continued.

205
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,940
"It is not too late to save you.

206
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,440
And we may succeed in helping Beatrice, too.

207
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,620
Do you see this little silver bottle?

208
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,990
It holds a medicine that will destroy even
the most powerful poison.

209
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,110
Give it to your Beatrice to drink."

210
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:55,419
Professor Baglioni put the little bottle on
the table and left Giovanni's room.

211
00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:04,880
The young man wanted to believe that Beatrice
was a sweet and Innocent girl, and yet, Professor

212
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,980
Bagllonl's words had put doubts in his heart.

213
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,200
It was nearly time for his daily meeting with
Beatrice.

214
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,700
As Giovanni combed his hair he looked at himself
in the mirror near his bed.

215
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,320
He could not help noticing how handsome he
was.

216
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:34,310
His eyes looked particularly bright, and his
face had a healthy warm glow.

217
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:43,880
He said to himself, "At least her poison has
not gotten into my body yet."

218
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,590
As he spoke he happened to look at some flowers
he had Just bought that morning.

219
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,640
A shock of horror went through his body.

220
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,240
The flowers were turning brown.

221
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,289
Giovanni's face became very white as he stared
at himself in the mirror.

222
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,050
Then he noticed a spider crawling near his
window.

223
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:14,980
He bent over the insect and blew a breath
of air at it.

224
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,080
The spider trembled and fell dead.

225
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,830
"I am cursed," Giovanni whispered to himself.

226
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,270
"My own breath is poisoned."

227
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:42,549
At that moment, a rich, sweet voice came floating
up from the garden, "Giovanni, you are late.

228
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,940
Come down!"

229
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,730
"You are a monster!"

230
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,030
Giovanni shouted as soon as he reached her.

231
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,809
"And with your poison you have made me into
a monster too.

232
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,640
I am a prisoner of this garden."

233
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,460
"Giovanni!"

234
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,920
Beatrice cried looking at him with her large
bright eyes.

235
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,830
"Why are you saying these terrible things?

236
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,890
It is true that I can never leave this garden.

237
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:24,020
But you are free to go wherever you wish."

238
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,510
Giovanni looked at her with hate in his eyes.

239
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,660
"Don't pretend that you don't know what you've
done to me!"

240
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,020
A group of insects had flown into the garden.

241
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,710
They came toward Giovanni and flew around
his head.

242
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,980
He blew his breath at them.

243
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,250
The insects fell to the ground dead.

244
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Beatrice screamed:

245
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,809
"I see it!

246
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,610
I see it!

247
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,800
My father's science has done this to us.

248
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,750
Believe me, Giovanni.

249
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,179
I did not ask him to do this to you.

250
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:07,090
I only wanted to love you."

251
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,130
Giovanni's anger changed to sadness.

252
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,620
Then he remembered the medicine that Professor
Baglioni had given him.

253
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:24,020
Perhaps, the medicine would destroy the poison
in their bodies and help them to become normal

254
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,380
again.

255
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,760
"Dear Beatrice," he said.

256
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,480
"Our fate is not so terrible."

257
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,960
He showed her the little silver bottle and
told her what the medicine inside it might

258
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
do.

259
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,720
"I will drink first," she said.

260
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,940
"You must wait to see what happens to me before
you drink it."

261
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,050
She put Baglioni's medicine to her lips and
took a small sip.

262
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:04,530
At the same moment Rapacini came out of his
house and walked slowly toward the two young

263
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,090
people.

264
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:12,230
He spread his hands out to them as if he were
giving them a blessing.

265
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,870
"My daughter," he said.

266
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,100
"You are no longer alone in the world.

267
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,990
Give Giovanni one of the purple flowers from
your favorite plant.

268
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,760
It will not hurt him now.

269
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,890
My science and your love have made him different
from ordinary men."

270
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:47,220
"My father," Beatrice said weakly, "why did
you do this terrible thing to your own child?"

271
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,030
Rapacini looked surprised.

272
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,490
"What do you mean, my daughter?" he asked.

273
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,400
"You have power no other woman has.

274
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,970
You can defeat your strongest enemy with only
your breath.

275
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,090
Would you rather be a weak woman?"

276
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:13,670
"I want to be loved, not feared," Beatrice
replied.

277
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,180
"But now it does not matter.

278
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,309
I am leaving you, Father.

279
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:24,260
I'm going where the poison you have given
me will do no harm.

280
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,509
Good-bye to you, Giovanni."

281
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,900
Beatrice dropped to the ground.

282
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,549
She died at the feet of her father and Giovanni.

283
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:41,610
The poison had been too much a part of the
young woman.

284
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,630
The medicine that destroyed the poison destroyed
her as well.

285
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:47,730
- THE END -
