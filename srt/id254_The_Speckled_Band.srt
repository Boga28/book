CHAPTER ONE

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,160
Helen's Story

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,360
At the time of this story,  

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:18,000
I was still living at my friend Sherlock 
Holmes's flat in Baker Street in London.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,840
Very early one morning, a young woman, 
dressed in black, came to see us.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,960
She looked tired and unhappy, 
and her face was very white.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,160
'I'm afraid!

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,560
Afraid of death, Mr Holmes!' she cried.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,160
'Please help me!

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm not thirty yet and look at my grey hair!

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,800
I'm so afraid!'

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,000
'Just sit down and tell us your 
story,' said Holmes kindly.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,840
'My name is Helen Stoner,' she began, 
'and I live with my stepfather,  

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,560
Dr Grimesby Roylott, near 
a village in the country.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,240
His family was once very rich, but they 
had no money when my stepfather was born.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,160
So he studied to be a doctor, 
and went out to India.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,720
He met and married my mother there, when 
my sister Julia and I were very young.

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,440
Our father was dead, you see.'

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,760
'Your mother had some money, 
perhaps?' asked Sherlock Holmes.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,720
'Oh yes, mother had a lot of money, so 
my stepfather wasn't poor any more.'

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,760
'Tell me more about him, 
Miss Stoner,' said Holmes.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,400
'Well, he's a violent man.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,520
In India he once got angry with 
his Indian servant and killed him!

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,760
He had to go to prison because of that, 
and then we all came back to England.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,440
Mother died in an accident eight years ago.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:20,680
So my stepfather got all her money, but if Julia 
or I marry, he must pay us 250 pounds every year.'

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,880
'And now you live with him 
in the country,' said Holmes.

29
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,160
'Yes, but he stays at home and never sees 
anybody, Mr Holmes!' answered Helen Stoner.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,680
'He's more and more violent now, and sometimes 
has fights with the people from the village.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Everybody's afraid of him now, and 
they run away when they see him.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,280
And they're also afraid of his Indian wild 
animals which run freely around the garden.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,960
A friend sends them to him from India.

34
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:07,480
And the animals are not the only wild things 
in the garden; there are also gipsies.

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:14,280
My stepfather likes these wild people, 
and they can come and go where they like.

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,960
Poor Julia and I had very unhappy lives.

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,120
We had no servants.

38
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,800
They always left because they 
were afraid of my stepfather,  

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,760
and we had to do all the work in the house.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,840
Julia was only thirty when she died, and her 
hair was already grey, like my hair now.'

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,880
'When did she die?' asked Sherlock Holmes.

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,000
'She died two years ago, and that's why I'm here.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,920
We never met anybody in the country, but sometimes 
we visited some of my family who live near London.

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,560
There Julia met a young 
man who asked to marry her.

45
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,680
My stepfather agreed, but 
soon after this she died.'

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,280
Miss Stoner put her hand over 
her eyes and cried for a minute.

47
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,520
Sherlock Holmes was listening 
with his eyes closed,  

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,800
but now he opened them and looked at Helen Stoner.

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,720
'Tell me everything about her death,' he said.

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
'I can remember it all very well.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,240
It was a terrible time!' she answered.

52
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,360
'Our three bedrooms are all downstairs.

53
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,440
First there is my stepfather's room.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:54,400
Julia's room is next to his, 
and my room is next to Julia's.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:03,760
The rooms all have windows on the garden side of 
the house, and doors which open into the corridor.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:11,480
One evening our stepfather was smoking 
his strong Indian cigarettes in his room.

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,120
Julia couldn't sleep because she 
could smell them in her room,  

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,640
so she came into my room to talk to me.

59
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,840
Before she went back to bed, she said 
to me, "Helen, have you ever heard a  

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,760
whistle in the middle of the night?"

61
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,800
I was surprised.

62
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,320
"No," I said.

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,640
"It's strange," she said.

64
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:48,760
"Sometimes I hear a whistle, but 
I don't know where it comes from.

65
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,480
Why don't you hear it?"

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,200
I laughed and said, "I sleep better than you  

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,680
do." So Julia went to her room, 
and locked the door after her.'

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,600
'Why did you lock your 
doors?' asked Sherlock Holmes.

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
'We were afraid of the wild animals, 
and the gipsies,' she answered.

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,040
'Please go on,' said Holmes.

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,560
'I couldn't sleep that night.

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,600
It was a very stormy night, 
with a lot of wind and rain.

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,640
Suddenly I heard a woman's scream.

74
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,200
It was my sister's voice.

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,760
I ran into the corridor, and 
just then I heard a whistle,  

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,440
and a minute later the sound of falling metal.

77
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
I didn't know what it was.

78
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
I ran to my sister's door.

79
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,120
She opened it and fell to the ground.

80
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,680
Her face was white and afraid, and she was crying,

81
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:10,520
"Help me, help me, Helen, I'm ill, I'm dying!"

82
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,960
I put my arms around her, and she 
cried out in a terrible voice:

83
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
"Helen!

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh my God, Helen!

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,600
It was the band!

86
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,720
The speckled band!"

87
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,880
She wanted to say more, but she couldn't.

88
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,180
I called my stepfather, who tried to 
help her, but we could do nothing.

89
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:46,080
And so my dear, dear sister died.'

90
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,200
'Are you sure about the whistle and the 
sound of falling metal?' asked Holmes.

91
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,240
'I think so,' answered Helen.

92
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
'But it was a very wild, stormy night.

93
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Perhaps I made a mistake.

94
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,840
The police couldn't understand why my sister died.

95
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,360
Her door was locked and nobody 
could get into her room.

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,120
They didn't find any poison in her body.

97
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:27,400
And what was "the speckled band"? Gipsies 
wear something like that round their necks.

98
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:36,320
I think she died because she was so afraid, 
but I don't know what she was afraid of.

99
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
Perhaps it was the gipsies.

100
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
What do you think, Mr Holmes?'

101
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,020
Holmes thought for a minute.

102
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,760
'Hmm,' he said.

103
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
That is a difficult question.

104
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,440
But please go on.'

105
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,520
'That was two years ago,' Helen Stoner said.

106
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,400
'I have been very lonely without my sister, but 
a month ago a dear friend asked me to marry him.

107
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,880
My stepfather has agreed, and 
so we're going to marry soon.

108
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,720
But two days ago I had to move 
to my sister's old bedroom,  

109
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:29,480
because some men are mending my bedroom wall, 
and last night I heard that whistle again!

110
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,560
I ran out of the house immediately and 
came to London to ask for your help.

111
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,240
Please help me, Mr Holmes!

112
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,880
I don't want to die like Julia!'

113
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,400
'We must move fast,' said Holmes.

114
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:54,800
'If we go to your house today, can we look at 
these rooms? But your stepfather must not know.'

115
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,000
'He's in London today, so he won't see you.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh thank you, Mr Holmes, I feel better 
already.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

117
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,320
CHAPTER TWO

118
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,560
Holmes and Watson Visit the House

119
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
Holmes went out for the morning, 
but he came back at lunch-time.

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,240
We then went by train into the country, 
and took a taxi to Dr Roylott's house.

121
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,320
'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'our dangerous 
friend Roylott needs the girls' money,  

122
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,920
because he only has 750 pounds 
a year from his dead wife.

123
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,600
I found that out this morning.

124
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,160
But the gipsies, the whistle, the band 
- they are more difficult to understand,  

125
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,920
but I think I have an answer.'

126
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,120
When we arrived, Helen Stoner 
showed us the three bedrooms.

127
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,960
We saw her room first.

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,240
'Why are they mending your 
bedroom wall?' asked Holmes.

129
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,600
'There's nothing wrong with it.'

130
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,200
'You're right,' she said.

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,360
'I think it was a plan to move 
me into my sister's room.'

132
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
'Yes,' said Holmes.

133
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,120
We went into Julia's room, and Holmes 
looked at the windows carefully.

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,600
'Nobody could come in from outside,' he said.

135
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,640
Then he looked round the room.

136
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,040
'Why is that bell-rope there, just over the bed?'

137
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
'My stepfather put it there two years ago.

138
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:44,840
It's for calling a servant, but Julia and I never 
used it because we didn't have any servants.

139
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,360
He also put in that air-vent on the 
wall between his room and this one.'

140
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,440
Holmes pulled the rope.

141
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,040
'But it doesn't work,' he said.

142
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,080
'How strange!

143
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,560
And it's just over the air-vent.

144
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760
That also is interesting.

145
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:15,520
Why have an air-vent on an inside wall? 
Air-vents are usually on outside walls.'

146
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Then we went into Dr Roylott's room.

147
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,800
Holmes saw a large metal box near the wall.

148
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,280
'My stepfather keeps business 
papers in there,' said Helen.

149
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,960
'Does he keep a cat in there too?' asked Holmes.

150
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,480
'Look!' There was some milk 
on a plate on top of the box.

151
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,520
'Now, Miss Stoner,' he said, 'I 
think your life is in danger.

152
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,760
Tonight my friend Watson and I must 
spend the night in your sister's room,  

153
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,520
where you are sleeping at the moment.'

154
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,920
Helen Stoner and I looked at him in surprise.

155
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,120
'Yes, we must,' he went on.

156
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,800
'We'll take a room in a hotel in the village.

157
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,680
When your stepfather goes to bed, put a light in 
your sister's bedroom window and leave it open.

158
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:24,080
Then go into your old room and we'll get 
into your sister's room through the window.

159
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,120
We'll wait for the sound of the 
whistle and the falling metal.'

160
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:39,640
'How did my sister die, Mr Holmes? Do 
you know? Please tell me!' said Helen.

161
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,760
She put her hand on Sherlock Holmes's arm.

162
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,840
'I must find out more before 
I tell you, Miss Stoner.

163
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Now goodbye, and don't be 
afraid,' replied Sherlock Holmes.

164
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,440
We walked to the village, and Holmes said 
to me, Tonight will be dangerous, Watson.

165
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,920
Roylott is a very violent man.'

166
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,600
'But if I can help, Holmes, I 
shall come with you,' I said.

167
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,160
'Thank you, Watson.

168
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
I'll need your help.

169
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:25,400
Did you see the bell-rope, and the air-vent? 
I knew about the air-vent before we came.

170
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,040
Of course there is a hole between the two rooms.

171
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,760
That explains why Helen's sister 
could smell Dr Roylott's cigarette.'

172
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,560
'My dear Holmes!

173
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,840
How clever of you!' I cried.

174
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,880
'And did you see the bed? It's fixed to the floor.

175
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,200
She can't move it.

176
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,040
It must stay under the rope, 
which is near the air-vent.'

177
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,400
'Holmes!' I cried.

178
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,960
'I begin to understand!

179
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,280
What a terrible crime!'

180
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,400
'Yes, this doctor is a very clever man.

181
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,320
But we can stop him, I think, 
Watson.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

182
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
CHAPTER THREE

183
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,920
Death in the Night

184
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
That night we went back to the house.

185
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,240
When we saw Helen Stoner's light, Holmes 
and I got in quietly through the window.

186
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Then we waited silently in the 
middle bedroom in the dark.

187
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,720
We waited for three hours and did not move.

188
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,120
Suddenly we saw a light and heard 
a sound from Dr Roylott's room.

189
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,600
But nothing happened, and 
again we waited in the dark.

190
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,840
Then there was another 
sound, a very quiet sound...

191
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,760
Immediately Holmes jumped up 
and hit the bell-rope hard.

192
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,080
'Can you see it, Watson?' he shouted.

193
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,080
But I saw nothing.

194
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,600
There was a quiet whistle.

195
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,720
We both looked up at the air-vent, and suddenly 
we heard a terrible cry in the next room.

196
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,760
Then the house was silent again.

197
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,160
'What does it mean?' I asked.

198
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
My voice was shaking.

199
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,480
'It's finished,' answered Holmes.

200
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,000
'Let's go and see.'

201
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,760
We went into Dr Roylott's room.

202
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,080
The metal box was open.

203
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Roylott was sitting on a chair, and 
his eyes were fixed on the air-vent.

204
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,760
Round his head was a strange, 
yellow speckled band.

205
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,960
He was dead.

206
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
'The band!

207
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,480
The speckled band!' said Holmes very quietly.

208
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,240
The band moved and began to turn its head.

209
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
'Be careful, Watson!

210
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:28,840
It's a snake, an Indian snake - and its 
poison can kill very quickly,' Holmes cried.

211
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
'Roylott died immediately.

212
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,240
We must put the snake back in 
its box.' Very, very carefully,  

213
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,120
Holmes took the snake and 
threw it into the metal box.

214
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,000
'But how did you know about 
the snake, Holmes?' I asked.

215
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,720
'At first, Watson, I thought 
that it was the gipsies.

216
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,400
But then I understood.

217
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:07,560
I thought that perhaps something came through the 
air-vent, down the bell-rope and on to the bed.

218
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,160
Then there was the milk - and 
of course, snakes drink milk.

219
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,120
It was easy for the Doctor to get Indian animals.

220
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,000
And because he was a doctor,  

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,880
he knew that this snake's poison is 
difficult to find in a dead body.

222
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,840
So every night he put the 
snake through the air-vent,  

223
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,760
and it went down the bell-rope on to the bed.

224
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:45,400
Of course, nobody must see the snake, so 
every night he whistled to call it back.

225
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,960
The sound of metal falling was the door of 
the metal box, which was the snake's home.

226
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,720
Perhaps the snake came through the 
air-vent many times before it killed Julia.

227
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,720
But in the end it killed her.

228
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,800
And Helen, too, nearly died because of this snake.

229
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:17,320
'But tonight, when I hit the snake on the rope, 
it was angry and went back through the air-vent.

230
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,200
And so it killed the Doctor.

231
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,400
I'm not sorry about that.'

232
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,080
Soon after this Helen Stoner  

233
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:37,640
married her young man and tried to forget the 
terrible deaths of her sister and stepfather.

234
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:49,000
But she never really forgot the speckled band.
