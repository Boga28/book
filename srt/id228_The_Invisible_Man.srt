CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,000
The Strange Man's Arrival

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,070
The stranger came early one winter's day in
February, through a biting wind and the last

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:19,080
snowfall of the year. He walked over the hill
from Bramblehurst Station, and carried a little

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,699
black bag in his thickly gloved hand. He was
wrapped up from head to foot, and the edge

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,920
of his soft grey hat hid every part of his
face except the shiny point of his nose; the

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,050
snow had piled itself against his shoulders
and chest. He almost fell into the Coach and

8
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:49,640
Horses, more dead than alive, and threw his
bag down. 'A fire,' he cried, 'in the name

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,910
of human kindness! A room and a fire!' He
stamped his feet, shook the snow from his

10
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,840
coat and followed Mrs Hall, the innkeeper's
wife, into her parlour. There he arranged

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,939
to take a room in the inn and gave her two
pounds.

12
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,980
Mrs Hall lit the fire and left him there while
she went to prepare him a meal with her own

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,439
hands. To have a guest at Iping in the winter
time was an unusual piece of good fortune,

14
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,939
and she was determined to show that she deserved
it.

15
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,040
She put some meat on the fire to cook, told
Millie, the servant, to get the room ready

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,330
for the stranger, and carried the cloth, plates
and glasses into the parlour, and began to

17
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:45,140
lay the table. Although the fire was burning
brightly, she was surprised to see that her

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,939
visitor still wore his hat and coat, and stood
with his back to her, looking out of the window

19
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:55,490
at the falling snow in the yard.

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:02,580
His gloved hands were held behind him, and
he seemed to be thinking deeply. She noticed

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,530
that some melted snow was falling onto the
floor from his shoulders.

22
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,319
'Can I take your hat and coat, sir,' she said,
'and dry them in the kitchen?'

23
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,290
'No,' he replied, without turning.

24
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,310
She was not sure that she had heard him, and
was about to repeat the question.

25
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:32,170
He turned his head and looked at her over
his shoulder. 'I would rather keep them on,'

26
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,300
he said firmly; and she noticed that he wore
big blue glasses, and had a bushy beard over

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,349
his coat collar that almost hid his face.

28
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:51,040
'Very well, sir,' she said. 'As you like.
Very soon the room will be warmer.'

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,000
He made no answer, and turned his face away
from her again, and Mrs Hall, feeling that

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,250
her talk was unwelcome, finished laying the
table quickly, and hurried out of the room.

31
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,599
When she returned he was still standing there
like a man of stone, his collar turned up,

32
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,830
the edge of his hat turned down, almost hiding
his face and ears. She put down the eggs and

33
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,780
meat noisily, and called rather than said
to him:

34
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,239
'Your lunch is served, sir.'

35
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,180
'Thank you,' he answered. He did not move
until she was closing the door. Then he turned

36
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,080
round and walked eagerly up to the table.

37
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,140
Mrs Hall filled the butter dish in the kitchen,
and took it to the parlour.

38
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,650
She knocked and entered at once. As she did
so her visitor moved quickly, so that she

39
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,170
only saw something white disappearing behind
the table. He seemed to be picking up something

40
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,349
from the floor. She put down the butter dish
on the table, and noticed that the visitor's

41
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,370
hat and coat were hanging over a chair in
front of the fire.

42
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,390
'I suppose I may have them to dry now?' she
said, in a voice that could not be refused.

43
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:18,509
'Leave the hat,' said her visitor, and turning,
she saw he had raised his head and was looking

44
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,880
at her.

45
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,479
For a moment she stood looking at him, too
surprised to speak.

46
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,470
He held his napkin over the lower part of
his face, so that his mouth and jaws were

47
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,840
completely hidden. But it was not that which
surprised Mrs Hall. It was the fact that the

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,820
top of his head above his blue glasses was
covered by a white bandage, and that another

49
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:53,669
covered his ears, leaving nothing of his face
to be seen except his pink, pointed nose.

50
00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:02,280
It was bright pink, and shining, just as it
had been at first. He wore a dark brown jacket,

51
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,220
with a high black collar turned up about his
neck. His thick black hair stuck out below

52
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,509
and between the bandages. This bandaged head
was so unlike what she had expected that for

53
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,070
a moment she stood staring at it.

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,470
He did not remove the napkin, but remained
holding it, as she saw now, with a brown-gloved

55
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,860
hand, and looking at her from behind his dark
glasses.

56
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,860
'Leave the hat,' he said, through the white
cloth.

57
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,960
She began to feel less afraid. She put the
hat on the chair again by the fire.

58
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,100
'I didn't know, sir,' she began, 'that-' and
she stopped.

59
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,979
'Thank you,' he said shortly, looking from
her to the door, and then at her again.

60
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,970
'I'll have it nicely dried, sir, at once,'
she said, and carried his coat out of the

61
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,000
room. She looked at his bandaged head and
dark glasses again as she was going out of

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,699
the door; but he was still holding his napkin
in front of his face. She was shaking a little

63
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:17,389
as she closed the door behind her. 'My goodness!'
she whispered. She went straight to the kitchen,

64
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,530
and did not even think of asking Millie what
she was doing now.

65
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,090
The visitor sat and listened to her footsteps.
He looked out of the window before he removed

66
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:35,069
his napkin from his face and began his meal
again. He took a mouthful, looked again at

67
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,759
the window, then rose and, taking the napkin
in his hand, walked across the room and pulled

68
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,060
down the blind. This darkened the room. He
returned more happily to the table and his

69
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,139
meal.

70
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:58,570
'The poor man's had an accident, or an operation
or something,' said Mrs Hall. 'What a shock

71
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,700
those bandages gave me.'

72
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,900
She put some more coal on the fire, and hung
the traveller's coat to dry. 'And the glasses!

73
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,650
Why, he doesn't look human at all. And holding
that napkin over his mouth all the time. Talking

74
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,880
through it!... Perhaps his mouth was hurt
too.'

75
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,139
She turned round, suddenly remembering something.
'Oh dear!' she said, 'Haven't you done those

76
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,110
potatoes yet, Millie?'

77
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:36,379
When Mrs Hall went to clear away the stranger's
lunch, her idea that his mouth must also have

78
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:42,169
been damaged in an accident was strengthened,
for though he was smoking a pipe, all the

79
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:48,130
time that she was in the room he kept the
lower part of his face covered. He sat in

80
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,789
the corner with his back to the window, and
spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being

81
00:07:53,789 --> 00:08:00,430
comfortably warmed through, less impatiently
than before. The light of the fire shone red

82
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,970
in his glasses.

83
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:11,110
'I have some boxes,' he said, 'at Bramblehurst
Station. How can they be brought here?'

84
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,810
Mrs Hall answered his question, and then said,
'It's a steep road by the hill, sir. That's

85
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,570
where a carriage was turned over, a year ago
and more. A gentleman was killed. Accidents,

86
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,360
sir, happen in a moment, don't they?'

87
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,130
'They do.'

88
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,099
'But people take long enough to get well,
sir, don't they? There was my sister's son,

89
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,769
Tom, who cut his arm with a scythe - he fell
on it out in the fields. He was three months

90
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:48,480
tied up, sir. You'd hardly believe it. I've
been afraid of scythes ever since, sir.'

91
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
'I can quite understand that,' said the visitor.

92
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,589
'We were afraid that he'd have to have an
operation, he was so bad, sir.'

93
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,519
The visitor laughed suddenly.

94
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,820
'Was he?'

95
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,940
'He was, sir. And it wasn't funny for those
who had to nurse him as I did, my sister being

96
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:15,339
so busy with her little ones. There were bandages
to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that

97
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,580
if I may say, sir-'

98
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,470
'Will you get me some matches?' said the visitor
quite suddenly. 'My pipe is out.'

99
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,580
Mrs Hall stopped. It was certainly rude of
him after she had told him so much. But she

100
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,269
remembered the two pounds, and went for the
matches.

101
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:39,260
'Thanks,' he said shortly, as she put them
down, and turned his back upon her and looked

102
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:46,209
out of the window again. Clearly he did not
like talking about bandages.

103
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:51,519
The visitor remained in the room until four
o'clock, without giving Mrs Hall an excuse

104
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,640
for a visit. He was very quiet during that
time: perhaps he sat in the growing darkness

105
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,170
smoking by the firelight - perhaps he slept.

106
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,829
Once or twice a listener might have heard
him: for five minutes he could be heard walking

107
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:14,010
up and down the room. He seemed to be talking
to himself. Then he sat down again in the

108
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,700
armchair.

109
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,060
CHAPTER TWO

110
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,110
Mr Henfrey Has a Shock

111
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,420
At four o'clock, when it was fairly dark,
and Mrs Hall was trying to find the courage

112
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,010
to go in and ask her visitor if he would like
some tea, Teddy Henfrey, the clock-mender,

113
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,170
came into the bar.

114
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:44,850
'Good evening, Mrs Hall,' said he, 'this is
terrible snowy weather for thin boots!'

115
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:52,500
Mrs Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his
bag with him. Now you're here, Mr Teddy,'

116
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,860
said she, 'I'd be glad if you'd look at the
old clock. It's going, and it strikes loud

117
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,079
and clear, but the hour hand does nothing
except point to six.'

118
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,630
And, leading the way, she went across to the
parlour door and knocked.

119
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,870
As she opened the door, she saw her visitor
seated in the armchair in front of the fire,

120
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,860
asleep, it seemed, with his bandaged head
leaning on one side. The only light in the

121
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,470
room was from the fire. Everything seemed
hidden in shadows. But for a second it seemed

122
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,890
to her that the man she was looking at had
a great, wide-open mouth, a mouth that swallowed

123
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:42,470
the whole of the lower part of his face. It
was too ugly to believe, the white head, the

124
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:51,230
staring glasses - and then a great hole. He
moved, sat up straight and put up his hand.

125
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,889
She opened the door wide, so that the room
was lighter, and she saw him more clearly,

126
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,460
with the napkin held to his face, just as
she had seen him hold it before. The shadows,

127
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,310
she thought, had tricked her.

128
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,830
'Would you mind, sir, if this man came to
look at the clock, sir?' she said.

129
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:16,720
'Look at the clock?' he said, staring round
sleepily and speaking over his hand; and then,

130
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,410
more fully awake, 'Certainly.'

131
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,670
Mrs Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose
and stretched himself. Then came the light,

132
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:34,630
and at the door Mr Teddy Henfrey was met by
this bandaged person. He was, he said later,

133
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,260
'quite shocked'.

134
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:43,029
'Good afternoon,' said the stranger, staring
at him - as Mr Henfrey said - 'like a fish'.

135
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,180
'I hope,' said Mr Henfrey, 'that you don't
mind.'

136
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,170
'Not at all,' said the stranger. 'Though I
understood,' he said, turning to Mrs Hall,

137
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,910
'that this room was to be mine for my own
use.'

138
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,820
'I thought, sir,' said Mrs Hall, 'you'd like
the clock-'

139
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,899
'Certainly,' said the stranger, 'certainly;
but at other times I would like to be left

140
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,420
alone.'

141
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,930
He turned round with his back to the fireplace,
and put his hands behind his back. 'And soon,'

142
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,620
he said, 'when the clock is mended, I think
I should like to have some tea. But not until

143
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,920
then.'

144
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,370
Mrs Hall was about to leave the room - she
did not try to talk this time - when her visitor

145
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,420
asked her if she had done anything about his
boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him that the

146
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,139
carrier could bring them over the next day.

147
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,910
'You are certain that is the earliest?' he
asked. She was quite sure.

148
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:50,130
'I should explain,' he added, 'but I was really
too cold and tired to do so before, that I

149
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,130
am a scientist.'

150
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,790
'Indeed, sir,' said Mrs Hall, respectfully.

151
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,500
'And I need things from the boxes for my work.'

152
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,050
'Of course, sir.'

153
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:09,990
'My reason for coming to Iping,' he went on
slowly, 'was a desire to be alone. I do not

154
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,100
wish to be disturbed in my work. Besides my
work, an accident-'

155
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,060
'I thought so,' said Mrs Hall to herself.

156
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:26,060
'-makes it necessary for me to be quiet. My
eyes are sometimes so weak and painful that

157
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,949
I have to shut myself up in the dark for several
hours and lock myself in. Sometimes - now

158
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:40,100
and then. Not at present, certainly. At such
times the least thing, even a stranger coming

159
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,480
into the room, gives me great pain. It's important
that this should be understood.'

160
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,509
'Certainly, sir,' said Mrs Hall. 'And if I
might ask-'

161
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:59,270
'That, I think, is all,' said the stranger
quietly. Mrs Hall said no more.

162
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,070
After Mrs Hall had left the room, he remained
standing in front of the fire and watched

163
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,600
the clock being mended. Mr Henfrey worked
with the lamp close to him, and the green

164
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,949
shade threw a bright light onto his hands
and onto the frame and wheels, and left the

165
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:21,420
rest of the room in shadow. He took longer
than he needed to remove the works, hoping

166
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,700
to have some talk with the stranger. But the
stranger stood there, perfectly silent and

167
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:35,230
still. So still that it frightened Henfrey.
He felt alone in the room and looked up, and

168
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,690
there, grey and shadowy, were the bandaged
head and large dark glasses staring straight

169
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,790
in front of them. It was so strange to Henfrey
that for a minute they stood staring at each

170
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:54,571
other. Then Henfrey looked down again. He
would have liked to say something. Should

171
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:58,350
he say that the weather was very cold for
the time of the year?

172
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,490
'The weather-' he began.

173
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,089
'Why don't you finish and go?' said the stiff
figure, angrily. 'All you've got to do is

174
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,520
to fix the hour hand. You're simply wasting
time.'

175
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:18,740
'Certainly, sir - one minute more. I forgot...'
And Mr Henfrey finished and left the room.

176
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,459
'Really!' said Mr Henfrey to himself, walking
down the village street through the falling

177
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:31,600
snow. 'A man must mend a clock sometimes,
surely.' And then, 'Can't a man look at you?

178
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,660
Ugly!'

179
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,720
And yet again, 'It seems he can't. If you
were wanted by the police, you couldn't be

180
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,529
more wrapped and bandaged.'

181
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:46,759
At the street corner he saw Hall, who had
recently married the lady of the inn. 'Hello,

182
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,199
Teddy,' said Hall, as he passed.

183
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,930
'You've got a strange visitor!' said Teddy.

184
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,649
Hall stopped. 'What did you say?' he asked.

185
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,970
'A strange man is staying at the inn,' said
Teddy. And he described Mrs Hall's guest.

186
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:10,220
'It looks strange, doesn't it? I'd like to
see a man's face if I had him staying in my

187
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,939
house. But women are so foolish with strangers.
He's taken your rooms, and he hasn't even

188
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,429
given a name.'

189
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,910
'Is that so?' said Hall, rather stupidly.

190
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,740
'Yes,' said Teddy. 'And he's got a lot of
boxes coming tomorrow, so he says.'

191
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,090
Teddy walked on, easier in his mind.

192
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,190
And after the stranger had gone to bed, which
he did at about half past nine, Mr Hall went

193
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,340
into the parlour and looked very hard at the
furniture, just to show that the stranger

194
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,070
wasn't master there. When he went to bed,
he told Mrs Hall to look very closely at the

195
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,480
stranger's boxes when they came next day.

196
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,030
'You mind your own business, Hall,' said Mrs
Hall, 'and I'll mind mine.'

197
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,400
But in the middle of the night she woke up
dreaming of great white heads that came after

198
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,910
her, at the end of long necks, and with big
black eyes. But being a sensible woman, she

199
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:21,520
turned over and went to sleep again.

200
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
CHAPTER THREE

201
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,511
The Thousand and One Bottles

202
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:35,070
That was how, on the ninth day of February,
the stranger came to Iping village. Next day

203
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:42,669
his boxes arrived. There were two trunks,
indeed, such as any man might have, but also

204
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:48,710
there was a box of books - big, fat books,
of which some were in handwriting you couldn't

205
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:55,760
read - and 12 or more boxes and cases full
of glass bottles, or so it seemed to Hall,

206
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,060
as he pulled at the paper packing material.
The stranger, covered up in hat, coat and

207
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:08,419
gloves, came out impatiently to meet the carriage,
while Hall was talking to Fearenside, the

208
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:14,330
carrier, before helping to bring the boxes
in. The stranger did not notice Fearenside's

209
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,580
dog, who was smelling at Hall's legs.

210
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,860
'Come along with those boxes,' he said. 'I've
been waiting long enough.' And he came down

211
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,559
the steps, as if to pick up the smaller case.

212
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,851
As soon as Fearenside's dog caught sight of
him, however, it began to growl, and when

213
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:39,310
he ran down the steps it went straight for
his hand. Hall cried out and jumped back,

214
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:47,770
for he was not very brave with dogs, and Fearenside
shouted, 'Lie down!' and reached for his whip.

215
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:53,039
They saw that the dog's teeth had missed the
stranger's hand, heard a kick, saw the dog

216
00:19:53,039 --> 00:20:00,530
jump and bite the stranger's leg, and heard
the sound of his trousers tearing. Then Fearenside's

217
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:07,299
whip cut into his dog, who, crying with pain,
ran under the wheels of the carriage. It was

218
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:15,400
all done in a quick half minute. No one spoke,
everyone shouted. The stranger looked at his

219
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,559
torn glove and at his leg, then turned and
ran up the steps into the inn. They heard

220
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,250
him go across the passage and up the stairs
to his bedroom.

221
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,210
'Come here, you!' said Fearenside to his dog,
climbing off the carriage with his whip in

222
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:38,350
his hand, while the dog watched him through
the wheel. 'Come here!' he repeated. 'You'd

223
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,350
better!'

224
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,390
Hall stood staring. 'He was bitten,' he said.
'I'd better go and see him.' And he went to

225
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:53,120
find the stranger. He met his wife in the
passage. 'The carrier's dog bit him,' he told

226
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,610
her.

227
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,571
He went straight upstairs, pushed open the
stranger's door and went in.

228
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:08,450
The blind was down and the room dark. He caught
sight of a strange thing, a handless arm that

229
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:16,440
seemed to be waving towards him, and a face
of three large dark spots on white. Then he

230
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,460
was struck in the chest and thrown out of
the room, and the door was shut in his face

231
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:28,170
and locked. All this happened so fast that
it gave him no time to see anything clearly.

232
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:36,809
A waving of shapes, a blow and a noise like
a gun. There he stood in the dark little passage,

233
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,110
wondering what he had seen.

234
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,180
After a few minutes he came back to the little
group that had formed outside the inn. There

235
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,480
was Fearenside telling the story all over
again for the second time; there was Mrs Hall

236
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,940
saying his dog had no right to bite her guests;
there was Huxter, the shopkeeper from over

237
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,391
the road, asking questions; Sandy Wadgers
looking serious and women and children, all

238
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,550
talking.

239
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,419
Mr Hall, staring at them from the steps and
listening, found it hard to believe that he

240
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,230
had seen anything very strange happen upstairs.

241
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,840
'He wants no help, he says,' he said in answer
to his wife's question. 'We'd better take

242
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,330
his luggage in.'

243
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,490
'He ought to have his leg looked at immediately,'
said Mr Huxter.

244
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,100
'I'd shoot the dog, that's what I'd do,' said
a lady in the group.

245
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,400
Suddenly the dog began growling again.

246
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,860
'Come along,' cried an angry voice in the
doorway, and there stood the stranger, with

247
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,620
his coat collar turned up and the edge of
his hat bent down.

248
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,920
'The sooner you get those things in, the better
I'll be pleased.' His trousers and gloves

249
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,750
had been changed.

250
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,690
'Were you hurt, sir?' said Fearenside. 'I'm
very sorry the dog-'

251
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:09,570
'Not at all,' said the stranger. 'It didn't
even break the skin. Hurry up with those things.'

252
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,809
As soon as the first box was carried into
the parlour, the stranger began to unpack

253
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:21,720
it eagerly, and from it he brought out bottles
- little fat bottles, small thin bottles,

254
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,700
blue bottles, bottles with round bodies and
thin necks, large green glass bottles, large

255
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,640
white glass bottles, wine bottles, bottles,
bottles, bottles - and put them in rows on

256
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,130
the table under the window, round the floor,
on the shelf - everywhere. Case after case

257
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,029
was full of bottles; he emptied six of the
cases and piled the packing material high

258
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,810
on the floor and table.

259
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,309
As soon as the cases were empty, the stranger
went to the window and set to work, not troubling

260
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:03,020
in the least about the paper, the fire which
had gone out, the box of books outside or

261
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,919
the boxes and other things that had gone upstairs.

262
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,679
When Mrs Hall took his dinner in to him, he
did not hear her until she had cleared away

263
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,640
most of the paper and had put the food on
the table.

264
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,799
Then he half turned his head, and turned it
away again. But she saw he had taken off his

265
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:30,660
glasses; they were beside him on the table,
and he seemed to her to have no eyes. He put

266
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,350
on his glasses again, and then turned and
faced her. She was about to complain about

267
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,510
the paper on the floor, but he spoke first.

268
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:44,559
'I wish you wouldn't come in without knocking,'
he said, angrily as usual.

269
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,990
'I knocked, but-'

270
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,559
'But in my work I cannot have any - I must
ask you-'

271
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,090
'Certainly, sir. You can turn the key if you
want to, you know. Any time.'

272
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,149
'A very good idea,' said the stranger.

273
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,919
'This paper, sir. If I might say-'

274
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,659
'Don't. If the paper is a problem, put it
on the bill.'

275
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:11,770
He was so strange, standing there, with his
bottles and his bad temper, that Mrs Hall

276
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:18,841
was quite afraid. But she was a strong-minded
woman. 'Then I should like to know, sir, what

277
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:19,870
you consider -'

278
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,620
'A shilling - put a shilling on my bill. Surely
a shilling's enough?'

279
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,070
'Very well,' said Mrs Hall, taking up the
tablecloth and beginning to spread it over

280
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,120
the table.

281
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,159
'If you're satisfied, of course-'

282
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,660
He turned his back on her and sat down.

283
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,310
All afternoon he worked with the door locked,
and almost in silence. But once there was

284
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,970
a noise of bottles ringing together, as though
the table had been hit, and the crash of glass

285
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:56,690
thrown down, and then came the sound of quick
walking up and down the room. Fearing something

286
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,580
was the matter, she went to the door and listened,
not wanting to knock.

287
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:10,330
'I can't go on,' he was shouting; 'I can't
go on! Three hundred thousand, four hundred

288
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:20,350
thousand! It may take me all my life!... Patience!
Patience, indeed!... Fool! Fool!'

289
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,210
There was a noise of boots on the brick floor
of the bar, and Mrs Hall could not stay to

290
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,280
hear any more. When she returned, the room
was silent again except for the faint sound

291
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,510
of his chair and now and then of a bottle.
It was all over; the stranger had returned

292
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,169
to his work.

293
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:45,809
Later, when she took in his tea, she saw broken
glass in the corner of the room. She pointed

294
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:46,809
at it.

295
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:53,001
'Put it on the bill,' he said. 'In God's name
don't worry me! If there's damage done, put

296
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:57,289
it on the bill.' And he went on with his writing.

297
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:05,670
'I'll tell you something,' said Fearenside.
It was late in the afternoon, and they were

298
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,270
in a little inn outside Iping.

299
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,860
'Well?' said Teddy Henfrey.

300
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:20,710
'This man you're speaking of, that my dog
bit. Well - he's black. At least his legs

301
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,159
are. I saw through the tear in his trousers
and the tear in his glove. You'd have expected

302
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,059
a sort of pink to show, wouldn't you? Well
- there was just blackness. I tell you he's

303
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:36,820
as black as my hat.'

304
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,799
'Good heavens!' said Henfrey. 'It's a very
strange case indeed. Why, his nose is as pink

305
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,840
as paint!'

306
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,760
'That's true,' said Fearenside. 'I know that.
And I tell you what I'm thinking. That man's

307
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:00,460
black here and white there - in pieces. And
he daren't show it. He's a kind of half-breed.

308
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:10,100
I've heard of such things before. And it's
common with horses, as anyone can see.'

309
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,340
CHAPTER FOUR

310
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,490
Mr Cuss Talks to the Stranger

311
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,620
The stranger rarely left the inn by day, but
in the evening he would go out, wrapped up

312
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:30,000
to the eyes, whether the weather was cold
or not, and he chose the loneliest paths.

313
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,590
His glasses and bandaged face under his great
black hat would appear suddenly out of the

314
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:42,000
darkness to one or two workmen going home,
and one night Teddy Henfrey, coming out of

315
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,140
the Dog and Duck, was frightened by the stranger's
white, round head (he was walking hat in hand)

316
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:55,399
lit by the sudden light of the open inn door.
It seemed doubtful whether the stranger hated

317
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:02,279
boys more than they hated him, but there was
certainly hatred enough on both sides.

318
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,350
Of course they talked about him in Iping,
and were unable to decide what his business

319
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:15,220
was. Mrs Hall said he 'discovered things',
that he had had an accident, and that he did

320
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,630
not like people to see the ugly marks on his
body. Some said that he was a criminal hiding

321
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,750
from the police, and others that he was part
white and part black, and 'if he chose to

322
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,039
show himself at fairs he would make a great
deal of money'. A few thought that he was

323
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:42,520
simply and harmlessly mad. And in the end
some of the women began to think that he was

324
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,580
a spirit or a magician.

325
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:53,130
No one liked him, for he was always angry
and never friendly. They drew to one side

326
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,390
as he passed down the village street, and
when he had gone by young men would put their

327
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:05,260
coat collars up and turn the edges of their
hats down, and follow him for a joke.

328
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:12,600
Cuss, the doctor, was interested in the bandages
and bottles. All through April and May he

329
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,860
wanted to talk to the stranger, and at last
he could bear it no longer and went to visit

330
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,960
him. He was surprised to find that Mr Hall
did not know his guest's name.

331
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,970
'He gave a name,' said Mrs Hall - this was
untrue - 'but I didn't hear it properly.'

332
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,360
She thought it seemed silly not to know the
man's name.

333
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,540
Cuss could hear swearing inside the parlour.
He knocked at the door and entered.

334
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,660
'Please forgive me for breaking in on you,'
said Cuss, and then the door closed and shut

335
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,440
out Mrs Hall.

336
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,289
She could hear the sound of voices for the
next ten minutes, then a cry of surprise,

337
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:04,600
a moving of feet, a chair being knocked over,
a laugh, quick steps to the door, and Cuss

338
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:12,419
appeared, his face white, his eyes staring
over his shoulder. He left the door open behind

339
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:19,059
him and, without looking at her, went across
the hall and down the steps, and she heard

340
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:25,679
his feet hurrying along the road. He carried
his hat in his hand. She stood behind the

341
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,570
bar, looking at the open door of the parlour.
Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly,

342
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:39,789
and his footsteps came across the room. She
could not see his face from where she stood.

343
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:44,980
The parlour door shut loudly, and the place
was silent again.

344
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,220
Cuss went straight up the village to Bunting,
the vicar.

345
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:54,700
'Am I mad?' Cuss began, as he entered the
little study. 'Do I look like a madman?'

346
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,639
'What's happened?' asked the vicar.

347
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:01,450
'That man at the inn...'

348
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,940
'Well?'

349
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,340
'Give me something to drink,' said Cuss, and
he sat down.

350
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,460
When his nerves had been steadied by a glass
of wine he said, 'As I went in, he put his

351
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,529
hands in his pockets and then he sat down
in his chair. I told him I'd heard he took

352
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:28,389
an interest in scientific things. He said,
"Yes." I tried to talk to him. He got quite

353
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:36,649
angry... Well, he told me that he had had
a piece of paper. It was important, most important,

354
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:44,889
most valuable. A list of... "Was it medicine?"
I asked. "Why do you want to know?" was his

355
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:52,320
answer. In any case, this paper was of great
value. He had read it, put it down on the

356
00:32:52,320 --> 00:33:00,580
table and looked away. Then the wind had lifted
it and blown it into the fire. He saw it go

357
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:09,530
up the chimney. Just as he told me that, he
lifted his arm. The sleeve was empty. I could

358
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:16,260
see right up it. What can keep a sleeve up
and open if there's nothing in it?

359
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,760
"How can you move an empty sleeve like that?"
I asked.

360
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,679
"Empty sleeve?" he said.

361
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,700
"Yes," I said, "an empty sleeve."

362
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:32,320
"It's an empty sleeve, is it? You saw it was
an empty sleeve?" He stood up. I stood up

363
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,039
too. He came towards me in three very slow
steps, and stood quite close.

364
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,650
"You said it was an empty sleeve?" he said.

365
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,070
"Certainly," I said.

366
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:51,400
Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out
of his pocket again, and raised his arm towards

367
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:59,240
me, as though he would show it to me again.
He did it very, very slowly. I looked at it,

368
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:06,940
holding my breath. "Well?" I said, clearing
my throat; "there's nothing in it."

369
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,770
'I was beginning to feel frightened. I could
see right down it. He put it out straight

370
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:21,871
towards me, slowly, slowly - just like that
- until it was 6 inches from my face. Just

371
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:28,030
imagine seeing an empty sleeve come at you
like that! And then-'

372
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,620
'Well?'

373
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:36,909
'Something - it felt exactly like a finger
and a thumb - pulled my nose.'

374
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,409
Bunting began to laugh.

375
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:45,429
'There wasn't anything there!' said Cuss,
his voice rising to a shout at the "there".

376
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:51,730
'You may laugh if you like, but I tell you
I was so shocked that I hit his sleeve hard

377
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,359
and turned round and ran out of the room I
left him-'

378
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,790
Cuss stopped. It was easy to see that he was
afraid. He turned round in a helpless way,

379
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,730
and took a second glass of wine. 'When I hit
his sleeve,' he said, 'I tell you, it felt

380
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:16,640
exactly like hitting an arm. And there wasn't
an arm! There wasn't any arm at all!'

381
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:25,020
Mr Bunting thought it over. 'It's a very strange
story,' he said. He looked very serious. 'It

382
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:32,140
really is a very strange story indeed.'

383
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,930
CHAPTER FIVE

384
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,900
The Robbery at the Vicarage

385
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,140
The robbery at the Vicarage happened in the
early hours of Whit Monday, the day when Iping

386
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:52,099
held its spring fair. Mrs Bunting, it seems,
woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes

387
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:57,619
before the sunrise, with a strong feeling
that the door of their bedroom had opened

388
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:05,910
and closed. She did not wake her husband at
first, but sat up in bed listening. She then

389
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,940
clearly heard the sound of bare feet coming
out of the next room and walking along the

390
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:18,070
passage towards the stairs. As soon as she
felt sure of this, she woke her husband as

391
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:25,089
quietly as she could. He did not light the
lamp, but put on his glasses and a pair of

392
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:31,829
soft shoes, and went out of the bedroom to
listen. He heard quite clearly someone moving

393
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:37,900
in the study downstairs, and then the sound
of a violent sneeze.

394
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,359
At that he returned to his bedroom, armed
himself with the poker, and went downstairs

395
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,270
as silently as he could. Mrs Bunting stood
at the top of the stairs.

396
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:56,390
It was about four o'clock, and the last darkness
of the night had passed. There was a faint

397
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:04,480
light in the passage; the study door stood
half open. Everything was quiet and still,

398
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,450
except the sound of the stairs under Mr Buntings
feet, and the slight movements in the study.

399
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:18,531
He heard a drawer being opened, and a sound
of papers. Then came some swearing, and a

400
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:26,690
match was struck, and the study was full of
yellow light. Mr Bunting was now in the hall,

401
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:32,850
and through the half-open door he could see
the desk, an open drawer, and a lamp burning

402
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:40,839
on the desk. But he could not see the thief.
He stood there considering what to do, and

403
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:48,130
Mrs Bunting, her face white with fear, walked
slowly downstairs after him.

404
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,060
They heard the noise of coins, and knew that
the thief had found the housekeeping money

405
00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:02,910
- two pounds and ten shillings in gold and
silver. That sound made Mr Bunting very angry.

406
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,820
Holding the poker firmly, he ran into the
room, closely followed by Mrs Bunting.

407
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:18,710
'Come on, my dear,' and then Mr Bunting stopped.
The room was perfectly empty.

408
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,859
But they knew that they had heard someone
moving in the room. They stood still for half

409
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:30,589
a minute. Then Mrs Bunting went across the
room and looked behind the curtain, while

410
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:35,940
Mr Bunting looked under the desk and up the
chimney, and pushed the poker up into the

411
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,550
darkness. Then they stood still looking at
each other questioningly.

412
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,770
'I was quite sure -' said Mrs Bunting.

413
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:51,550
'The lamp!' said Mr Bunting. 'Who lit the
lamp?'

414
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:57,270
'The drawer!' said Mrs Bunting. 'And the money's
gone!'

415
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,310
She went quickly to the doorway.

416
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,651
'Who in the world -'

417
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:07,430
There was a loud sneeze in the passage. They
rushed out, and as they did so the kitchen

418
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,550
door closed!

419
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:14,530
'Bring the lamp!' said Mr Bunting, and led
the way.

420
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:20,170
As he opened the kitchen door, he saw the
back door opening. The garden beyond was lit

421
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:26,650
by the first, faint light of sunrise. He was
certain that nothing went out of the door.

422
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,690
It stood open for a moment, and then closed
with a loud bang. They searched outside for

423
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,200
a minute or more before they came back into
the kitchen.

424
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,370
The place was empty. They locked the back
door and examined the kitchen and all the

425
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:47,440
rooms thoroughly. There was no one to be found
in the house, though they searched upstairs

426
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,329
and down.

427
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:55,730
When daylight came, the vicar and his wife
were still searching by the unnecessary light

428
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,010
of the dying lamp.

429
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:04,780
'Of all the surprising events, this is -' began
the vicar for the twentieth time.

430
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,690
'My dear,' said Mrs Bunting, 'there's the
servant coming down. Just wait here until

431
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:17,440
she has gone into the kitchen, and then go
upstairs.'

432
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,490
CHAPTER SIX

433
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,630
The Furniture That Went Mad

434
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,040
When Mr Hall came downstairs in the early
hours of Whit Monday, he noticed that the

435
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,050
stranger's door was open and the front door
unlocked. He remembered holding the lamp while

436
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:41,890
Mrs Hall locked it the night before. At the
sight of the front door he stopped; then he

437
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:49,500
went upstairs again. He knocked at the stranger's
door. There was no answer. He knocked again;

438
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,839
then pushed the door wide open and entered.

439
00:40:52,839 --> 00:41:00,380
It was as he expected. The bed, the room too,
was empty. And what was still more strange,

440
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,030
on the bed and chair were scattered the clothes,
the only clothes so far as he knew, and the

441
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:11,020
bandages of their guest. His big hat was hanging
on the bedpost.

442
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,520
As Mr Hall stood there he heard his wife's
voice coming from the kitchen.

443
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,960
He turned and hurried down to her.

444
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,210
'Jenny,' he said, 'he's not in his room and
the front door is unlocked.'

445
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,570
At first Mrs Hall did not understand, but
as soon as she did she determined to see the

446
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:39,090
empty room for herself. Hall went first. 'If
he's not there, his clothes are. And what

447
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,339
is he doing without his clothes?'

448
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:46,260
As they came out of the kitchen they both
thought they heard the front door open and

449
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,430
shut but, seeing it closed and seeing nothing
there, neither said a word to the other about

450
00:41:52,430 --> 00:42:00,930
it at the time. Mrs Hall passed her husband
in the passage, and ran on first upstairs.

451
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:07,000
Someone on the staircase sneezed. Mr Hall,
following six steps behind, thought that he

452
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,740
heard her sneeze; she, going first, thought
that he was sneezing. She threw open the door

453
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:20,270
and stood looking round the room. 'What a
strange thing!' she said.

454
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:25,240
She heard a cough close behind her, as it
seemed, and, turning, was surprised to see

455
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,430
her husband some distance away on the top
stair. But in another moment he was beside

456
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,640
her. She put her hand under the bedcovers.

457
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,650
'Cold,' she said. 'He's been up an hour or
more.'

458
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:45,730
At that point, a most unexpected thing happened.
The bedcovers pulled themselves together into

459
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,579
a pile, and then jumped violently off the
bed. It was just as if a hand had thrown them

460
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:57,980
to one side. Then the stranger's hat jumped
off the bedpost, flew through the air, and

461
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:05,730
came straight at Mrs Hall's face. Next, a
piece of soap flew from the washstand. Finally

462
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:11,710
the chair threw the stranger's coat and trousers
carelessly onto the floor, laughed in a voice

463
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:18,290
very like the stranger's, turned itself round
so that its four legs pointed at Mrs Hall,

464
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:23,790
seemed to take aim at her for a moment, and
then moved quickly towards her. She cried

465
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:29,800
out and turned, and the chair legs landed
gently but firmly against her back and pushed

466
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,890
her and Mr Hall out of the room. The door
shut loudly and was locked. The chair and

467
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:43,760
the bed seemed to be dancing for a moment,
and then suddenly everything was still.

468
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,490
Mrs Hall was left almost fainting in Mr Hall's
arms in the passage. It was with the greatest

469
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:56,040
difficulty that Mr Hall and Millie, now dressed,
succeeded in getting her downstairs.

470
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:03,500
'Spirits,' said Mrs Hall. 'I know it's spirits.
I've read about them in the papers. Tables

471
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,030
and chairs dancing.'

472
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:12,380
'Lock him out,' she went on. 'Don't let him
come in again. I half guessed... I might have

473
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:19,339
known. With those eyes and that bandaged head,
and never going to church on Sunday. And all

474
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:26,490
those bottles - more than it's right for anyone
to have. He's put the spirits into the furniture...

475
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:33,020
My good old furniture! My poor dear mother
used to sit in that chair when I was a little

476
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,869
girl. And now it rises against me!'

477
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:42,809
They sent Millie across the street through
the golden five o'clock sunshine to wake up

478
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:48,260
Mr Sandy Wadgers, who was clever and might
be able to help them.

479
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:54,460
'Magic,' said Mr Wadgers and came to the inn
greatly troubled. They wanted him to lead

480
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,270
the way upstairs to the room, but he didn't
seem to be in any hurry. He preferred to talk

481
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:07,790
in the passage. Then Mr Huxter came and joined
in the talk. There was a great deal of talking,

482
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,700
but nothing was done.

483
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:17,460
'Let's have the facts first,' said Mr Sandy
Wadgers. 'Let's be sure we'd be acting perfectly

484
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,819
right in breaking that door open.'

485
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:26,430
And suddenly the door of the room upstairs
opened by itself, and they saw coming down

486
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,000
the stairs the wrapped-up figure of the stranger
staring more blackly than ever through those

487
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,329
large glasses. He came down stiffly and slowly,
staring all the time; he walked across the

488
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:42,820
passage, staring, and then stopped.

489
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,680
He entered the parlour, and suddenly and angrily
shut the door in their faces.

490
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:55,310
Not a word was spoken until the noise of the
door had died away. They looked at one another.

491
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:02,880
'Well, I've never seen anything like it!'
said Mr Wadgers, more troubled than ever.

492
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,880
'If I were you, I'd go in and ask him about
it,' Mr Wadgers advised Mr Hall. 'I'd demand

493
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,260
an explanation.'

494
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:18,500
It took some time to persuade Mr Hall to do
it. At last he knocked, opened the door, and

495
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,670
got as far as:

496
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,670
'Excuse me-'

497
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:26,100
'Go to the devil!' said the stranger, 'and
shut that door after you.'

498
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,670
And that was all.

499
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,890
CHAPTER SEVEN

500
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,910
The Stranger Shows His Face

501
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:43,520
It was half past five when the stranger went
into the little parlour of the Coach and Horses,

502
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,240
and there he remained until nearly midday,
with the blinds down and the door shut, and

503
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,119
nobody went near him.

504
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:59,400
All that time he could have eaten nothing.
Three times he rang his bell, the third time

505
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:07,819
loud and long, but no one answered him. 'Telling
us to go to the devil, indeed!' said Mrs Hall.

506
00:47:07,819 --> 00:47:13,390
Soon came the story of the robbery at the
Vicarage, and that started them thinking.

507
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:19,690
Hall went off with Wadgers to find Mr Shuckleforth,
the lawyer, and take his advice. No one went

508
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:25,420
upstairs, and no one knew what the stranger
was doing. Now and then he walked rapidly

509
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:31,500
up and down, and they heard him swearing,
tearing paper, breaking bottles.

510
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:38,290
The little group grew bigger. Mrs Huxter came
over; some young fellows joined them. There

511
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:44,010
was a stream of unanswered questions. Young
Archie Harker tried to look under the closed

512
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:49,960
curtains. He could see nothing, but he was
soon joined by other boys.

513
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,050
And inside in the darkness of the parlour,
the stranger, hungry and afraid, hidden in

514
00:47:56,050 --> 00:48:02,119
his uncomfortable hot clothes, stared through
his dark glasses at his paper, or shook his

515
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:08,300
dirty little bottles or swore at the boys
outside the windows. In the corner by the

516
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,670
fireplace lay the pieces of several broken
bottles, and the sharp smell of a strange

517
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,859
gas filled the air.

518
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:23,069
At about midday he suddenly opened his parlour
door and stood looking at the three or four

519
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:30,130
people in the bar. 'Mrs Hall,' he said. Somebody
went and called for her.

520
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:37,559
She soon appeared, a little short of breath,
and so even more angry. Hall was still out.

521
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,540
She had had time to think now, and had brought
the stranger's unpaid bill.

522
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:48,520
'Why wasn't my breakfast laid?' he asked.
'Why haven't you prepared my meals and answered

523
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,040
my bell? Do you think I can live without eating?'

524
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,609
'Why isn't my bill paid?' said Mrs Hall. 'That's
what I want to know.'

525
00:48:57,609 --> 00:49:01,380
'I told you three days ago I was expecting
some money-'

526
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,579
'I told you three days ago I wasn't going
to wait. You can't complain if your breakfast

527
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:13,170
waits a bit, when my bill's been waiting for
five days, can you?'

528
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,549
The stranger swore in answer.

529
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:22,290
'And I'd thank you, sir, if you'd keep your
swearing to yourself sir,' said Mrs Hall.

530
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,200
'Look here, my good woman-' he began.

531
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,900
'Don't call me your good woman,' said Mrs
Hall.

532
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,720
'I've told you my money hasn't come.'

533
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,150
'Money, indeed!' said Mrs Hall.

534
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,530
'Still, in my pocket-'

535
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,780
'You told me three days ago that you hadn't
anything but a pound's worth of silver on

536
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,780
you.'

537
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,190
'Well, I've found some more.'

538
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,490
'And where did you find that?' said Mrs Hall.

539
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,099
He stamped his foot. 'What do you mean?' he
said.

540
00:49:55,099 --> 00:50:03,020
'I mean where did you find it?' said Mrs Hall.
'And before I take any money, or get any breakfasts,

541
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:08,950
or do any such things, you must tell me one
or two things that I don't understand, and

542
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:16,280
that nobody understands, and that everybody
is very anxious to understand. I want to know

543
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,540
what you have been doing to my chair upstairs,
and I want to know why you went out of your

544
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,980
bedroom and how you got in again. Those who
stay here come in by the doors - that's the

545
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,980
rule of this house, and you didn't do that,
and what I want to know is how you did come

546
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,290
in. And I want to know-'

547
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:42,990
Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands,
stamped his toot, and said 'Stop!' so loudly

548
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,359
that he silenced her at once.

549
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:54,750
'You don't understand,' he said, 'who I am
or what I am. I'll show you. By heaven! I'll

550
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:04,000
show you.' He put his open hand over his face
and then took it away. His face became a black

551
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:12,570
hole. Here,' he said. He stepped forward and
handed Mrs Hall something which she, staring

552
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:19,670
at his face, took without thinking. Then,
when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly

553
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:29,130
and dropped it. The nose - it was the stranger's
nose, pink and shining! - rolled on the floor.

554
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:35,000
Then he removed his glasses, and everyone
in the bar breathed deeply. He took off his

555
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,280
hat, and tore at his beard and bandages.

556
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,550
It was worse than anything they had ever seen.
Mrs Hall, open-mouthed with terror, ran to

557
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,930
the door of the house.

558
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:55,280
Everyone began to move. They had expected
burns, wounds, something ugly, but they saw

559
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:02,080
- nothing! The bandages and false hair flew
across the passage into the bar. Everyone

560
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,410
fell over everyone else down the steps. For
the man who stood there shouting was a man

561
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,380
up to the shoulders, and then - nothing!

562
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,230
People down in the village heard shouts and
saw the people rushing out of the inn. They

563
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:23,420
saw Mrs Hall fall down, and Mr Henfrey jump,
so as not to fall over her, and then they

564
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:28,839
heard the frightful cries of Millie, who,
running quickly from the kitchen at the noise,

565
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:35,260
had come on the headless stranger from behind.
Then her cries stopped suddenly.

566
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,180
Everyone in the village street, old and young,
about forty or more of them, collected in

567
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,520
a crowd around the inn door.

568
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,359
'What was he doing?'

569
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:46,369
'Ran at them with a knife.'

570
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:48,400
'I heard the girl.'

571
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,260
'No head, I tell you.'

572
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,260
'Nonsense.'

573
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,199
'Took off his bandages.'

574
00:52:54,199 --> 00:53:02,590
Everyone spoke at once. Suddenly Mr Hall appeared,
very red and determined, then Mr Bobby Jaffers,

575
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:07,890
the village policeman and then the serious
Mr Wadgers.

576
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:14,180
Mr Hall marched up the steps, walked straight
to the door of the parlour and found it open.

577
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:19,349
'Policeman,' he said, 'do your duty.'

578
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:26,540
Jaffers marched in, Hall next, Wadgers last.
They saw the headless figure facing them,

579
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:31,760
with a half-eaten piece of bread in one gloved
hand and a piece of cheese in the other.

580
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,549
'That's him,' said Hall.

581
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:40,250
'What the devil's this?' came in an angry
voice from above the collar of the strange

582
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,250
figure.

583
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:47,049
'Well, Mister,' said Jaffers, 'I've got to
arrest you, head or no head.'

584
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:50,810
'Keep off!' said the stranger, jumping back.

585
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:56,569
He took off his glove and with it struck Jaffers
in the face. In another moment Jaffers had

586
00:53:56,569 --> 00:54:02,650
seized him by the handless wrist, and caught
his invisible throat. He got a hard kick that

587
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:08,869
made him shout with pain, but he kept his
hold. A chair stood in the way, and fell with

588
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:11,090
a crash as they came down together.

589
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,970
'Get hold of his feet,' said Jaffers between
his teeth to the other men.

590
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:21,940
When he tried to obey this order, Mr Hall
received a great kick in the chest that finished

591
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:27,660
him for a time; and Mr Wadgers, seeing that
the headless stranger had rolled over and

592
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:33,569
got on top of Jaffers, went backwards towards
the door, and so fell against Mr Huxter and

593
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:39,569
another man coming to help the policeman.
Four bottles fell and broke on the floor,

594
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,920
filling the room with a powerful smell.

595
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:49,490
'I give in,' said the stranger, though he
had thrown Jaffers down; and in another moment

596
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:57,211
he stood up, shaking, breathless. A strange
thing, he looked, without head or hands. His

597
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:03,290
voice seemed to come out of nothing. Jaffers
also got up.

598
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:08,240
The stranger ran his arm down his coat, and
the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed

599
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,309
became undone. Then he bent down and seemed
to touch his shoes.

600
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:23,520
'Why!' said Huxter suddenly, 'That's not a
man at all. It's just empty clothes. Look!

601
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,099
You can see down his collar and his shirt.
I could put my arm-'

602
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:32,920
He stretched out his hand; it seemed to meet
something in the air, and he pulled it back

603
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,600
with a sharp cry of surprise.

604
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:42,359
I wish you'd keep your fingers out of my eye,'
shouted the voice in anger. 'The fact is,

605
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:50,589
I'm all here - head, hands, legs, and all
the rest of it, but it happens I'm invisible.

606
00:55:50,589 --> 00:55:56,030
But that's no reason why you should put your
fingers in my eye, is it?'

607
00:55:56,030 --> 00:56:00,170
The suit of clothes, now all unbuttoned, stood
up.

608
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:04,780
Several other men had now come into the room,
so that it was crowded.

609
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:10,230
'Invisible, eh?' said Huxter. 'Who ever heard
of such a-'

610
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:16,850
'It's strange, perhaps, but it's not a crime.
Why am I attacked by a policeman in this way?'

611
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:25,170
'Ah! That's different,' said Jaffers. 'I can't
see you, but I have orders to arrest you,

612
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,270
not because you can't be seen, but because
a house has been robbed.'

613
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,270
'Well?'

614
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,500
'And it looks as if-'

615
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,829
'Nonsense,' said the Invisible Man.

616
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:41,619
'I hope so, sir. But I've got my orders.'

617
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:46,619
Suddenly the man sat down, and before anyone
could think of stopping him, he had thrown

618
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:50,000
off all his clothes - all except his shirt.

619
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,950
'Here, stop that,' said Jaffers suddenly.
'Hold him,' he cried. 'If he gets his shirt

620
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,950
of-'

621
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:03,450
'Hold him,' shouted everyone, and there was
a rush at the white shirt, which was now all

622
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,460
that could be seen of the stranger.

623
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,579
The shirt sleeve struck a blow in Hall's face
that sent him backward into old Toothsome,

624
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:16,870
the gravedigger, and in another moment the
shirt was lifted up, just like a shirt that

625
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:23,580
is being pulled over a man's head. Jaffers
tore at it but only helped to pull it off.

626
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:28,319
He was struck in the mouth out of the air,
and lifted his stick and hit Teddy Henfrey

627
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,260
hard on the top of his head.

628
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:37,700
'Look out!' cried everybody, hitting everywhere
at nothing. 'Hold him! Shut the door! Don't

629
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:45,320
let him go! I've got something! Here he is!'
Everybody was being hit at once, falling on

630
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:52,380
one another. Sandy Wadgers opened the door
and they fell out. The hitting went on. One

631
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:59,000
man had a tooth broken, another a swollen
ear. Jaffers was struck under the jaw. He

632
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,960
caught at something hard that stood between
him and Huxter. Then the whole mass of struggling,

633
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,089
excited men fell out into the crowded hall.

634
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:15,349
The battle moved quickly to the house door.
There were excited cries of 'Hold him!'

635
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:21,060
'Invisible!', and a young man, a stranger
to the place, rushed in, caught something,

636
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:27,349
missed his hold, and fell over another man's
body. Halfway across the road a woman fainted

637
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:34,490
as something pushed past her, a dog ran growling
into Huxter's yard, and with that the Invisible

638
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,089
Man was gone.

639
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:43,900
For a moment people stood, not knowing what
to do. And then they ran, scattered as the

640
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,630
wind scatters dead leaves.

641
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:54,550
But Jaffers lay quite still, face upward and
knees bent.

642
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,819
CHAPTER EIGHT

643
00:58:56,819 --> 00:59:00,289
On the Road

644
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:06,670
Mr Thomas Marvel, a tramp, had removed his
boots and was sitting by the roadside airing

645
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:13,039
his feet and looking sadly at his toes. They
were the best boots he had worn for a long

646
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:20,369
time, but he hated them for their ugliness
and their size. 'The ugliest boots in the

647
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:23,600
whole world, I should think,' he said.

648
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,690
'They're boots, anyway,' said a Voice.

649
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:35,670
'Yes,' Mr Marvel agreed. 'They were given
to me. Too large. I'm tired of them. That's

650
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:43,450
why I've been begging for boots, boots, boots
everywhere, but no one has any to give away.'

651
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,819
'Hm,' said the Voice.

652
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:52,890
'No. I've been begging for boots round here
for ten years. I've got all my boots around

653
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:58,440
here, and now look at them - they're the best
they can find for me.'

654
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,359
He turned his head over his shoulder to look
at the boots of the speaker - but they weren't

655
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,440
there. There were neither boots nor legs - nothing.

656
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:16,119
'Where are you?' he asked. He saw the road,
the open country, but no sign of any man except

657
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:21,120
himself. 'Am I mad? I must be seeing things.'

658
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:26,049
'No, you aren't,' said the Voice. 'Don't be
frightened.'

659
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:32,680
'Frightened, frightened!' said Mr Marvel.
'Come here. Where are you?'

660
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,390
'Don't be frightened,' said the Voice.

661
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:40,829
'You'll be frightened soon. Let me get hold
of you. Are you buried?'

662
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:44,829
There was no answer. Mr Marvel began to put
on his coat.

663
01:00:44,829 --> 01:00:47,900
'I could have sworn I heard a voice.'

664
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,730
'So you did.'

665
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:56,160
'It's there again,' said Mr Marvel, closing
his eyes and running his hand across his forehead.

666
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,680
'I must have gone mad.'

667
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:05,530
'Don't be a fool,' said the Voice. 'You think
I'm just in your imagination - just in your

668
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,900
mind?'

669
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,210
'What else can you be?' said Mr Marvel, rubbing
the back of his neck.

670
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:18,960
'Very well,' said the Voice, 'I'm going to
throw stones at you until you think differently.'

671
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,390
'But where are you?'

672
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:28,859
The Voice made no answer. A stone came whistling
through the empty air and just missed Mr Marvel's

673
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:34,789
shoulder. He turned round and saw a stone
jump up into the air, hang there for moment,

674
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:43,069
and fall at his feet. Another came and hit
his bare toes which made Mr Marvel cry aloud.

675
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:49,369
Then he started to run, fell over something
unseen, and came to rest sitting by the road.

676
01:01:49,369 --> 01:01:55,079
'Now,' said the Voice, 'am I just in your
mind?'

677
01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:02,130
Mr Marvel struggled to his feet, and was immediately
rolled over again. He lay quiet for a moment.

678
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:07,920
'If you struggle anymore,' said the Voice,
'I'll throw this stone at your head.'

679
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,520
'I'm finished,' said Mr Thomas Marvel, sitting
up and taking his wounded toe in his hand.

680
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:22,529
'I don't understand it. Stones throwing themselves.
Stones talking. I'm finished.'

681
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:27,829
'It's very simple,' said the Voice. 'I'm an
invisible man.'

682
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:34,080
'Tell me something I don't know,' said Mr
Marvel, white with the pain. 'Where you're

683
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,190
hidden - how you do it - I don't know.'

684
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:44,700
'I'm invisible,' said the Voice. 'That's what
I want you to understand.

685
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:51,339
'Anyone can see that. There's no need for
you to be so angry. Now then. Give us an idea.

686
01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:54,039
Where are you hidden?'

687
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:59,809
'I'm invisible. That's the point. And what
I want you to understand is this-'

688
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:04,170
'But where are you?' interrupted Mr Marvel.

689
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,069
'Here - six yards in front of you.'

690
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:13,160
'Oh, no! I'm not blind. You'll be telling
me next you're just thin air.'

691
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:18,990
'Yes. I am - thin air. You're looking through
me.'

692
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:21,569
'What! Isn't there anything in you?'

693
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:29,420
'I am just a human being - solid, needing
food and drink, needing clothes, too... But

694
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:35,480
I'm invisible. You see? Invisible. Simple
idea. Invisible.'

695
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,549
'What, are you real?'

696
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,059
'Yes, real.'

697
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:47,260
'Let me feel your hand,' said Marvel, 'if
you are real.'

698
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,160
He felt with his fingers the hand that had
closed round his wrist and his touch went

699
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,890
up the arm, found a chest, and touched a bearded
face.

700
01:03:57,890 --> 01:04:01,369
Mr Marvel's own face showed shock and surprise.

701
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:08,140
'Of course, all this isn't half so strange
as you think,' said the Invisible Man.

702
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:17,040
'It's quite strange enough for me,' said Mr
Marvel. 'How do you manage it? How is it done?'

703
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,520
'It's a very long story. And besides-'

704
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:26,809
'I tell you, the whole business is - I can't
understand,' said Mr Marvel.

705
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:35,599
'What I want to say now is this: I need help.
I need help immediately. I came on you suddenly.

706
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,119
I was wandering around helpless, without clothes.
And I saw you-'

707
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:43,299
'Oh, Lord!' said Mr Marvel.

708
01:04:43,299 --> 01:04:52,380
'I came up behind you, stopped, went on, then
stopped again. "Here," I said to myself, "is

709
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,990
the man for me." So I turned and came back
to you. You. And-'

710
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:06,309
'Oh, Lord!' said Mr Marvel. 'May I ask: What
does it feel like? And what kind of help do

711
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:08,809
you need? Invisible!'

712
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:15,830
'I want you to help me get clothes and shelter,
and then other things. I've left those things

713
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:21,850
long enough. If you won't - well!... But you
will - you must.'

714
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:29,279
'Look here,' said Mr Marvel. 'Don't knock
me about any more. And let me go. I must get

715
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:37,309
my breath back. And you've very nearly broken
my toe. It's all so unreasonable. Empty earth,

716
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:43,930
empty sky. Nothing visible for miles except
Nature. And then comes a voice. A voice out

717
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:48,619
of heaven! And stones. And a hand. Lord!'

718
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:53,910
'Pull yourself together,' said the Voice,
'for you have to do the work I want you to

719
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,369
do.'

720
01:05:55,369 --> 01:06:00,220
Mr Marvel's mouth opened wide, and his eyes
were round.

721
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:06,920
'I've chosen you,' said the Voice. 'You are
the only man except some of those fools down

722
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:14,250
there who knows there is such a thing as an
Invisible Man. You have to be my helper. Help

723
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:21,920
me - and I will do great things for you. An
Invisible Man is a man of great power.' He

724
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,349
stopped for a moment to sneeze loudly.

725
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:29,710
'But if you trick me,' he said, 'if you fail
to do as I tell you-'

726
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:37,029
He paused and took hold of Mr Marvel's shoulder.
Mr Marvel gave a cry of terror at the touch.

727
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:44,569
'I don't want to trick you,' he said, moving
away from the fingers. 'Don't think that,

728
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:51,441
whatever you do. All I want to do help you
- just tell me what I have got to do. Whatever

729
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:56,790
you want done, I shall be pleased to do it.'

730
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:02,710
At about four o'clock, a stranger entered
the village from the direction of the hills.

731
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:10,390
He was a short, fat person in a dirty old
hat and he seemed to be very much out of breath.

732
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:15,869
There was fear in his face, and he seemed
to be talking to himself. Some of the village

733
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:24,230
men noticed him. Mr Huxter saw him go up the
steps of the inn, and turn towards the parlour.

734
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:28,490
Mr Huxter heard voices from the parlour telling
the man that he must not go in.

735
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:37,270
'That room's private!' said Mr Hall, and the
stranger shut the door and went into the bar.

736
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:43,490
A few minutes later he came out again, rubbing
his mouth as if he had been having a drink.

737
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:48,599
He stood looking around him for a few moments,
and then walked towards the gates of the yard,

738
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:54,369
where the parlour window was. He leant against
one of the gateposts and took out a short

739
01:07:54,369 --> 01:08:00,450
pipe. Although he seemed calm, his hands were
trembling.

740
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:05,480
Suddenly he put the pipe back in his pocket
and disappeared into the yard. Immediately

741
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:11,539
Mr Huxter, guessing that the man was a thief,
ran out of his shop to stop him. As he did

742
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:16,711
so, Mr Marvel reappeared, carrying some clothes
tied together in one hand and three books

743
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:22,779
in the other. As soon as he saw Huxter he
turned and began to run towards the hill road.

744
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:28,600
'Stop thief!' cried Huxter, and set off after
him.

745
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,429
Mr Huxter had hardly gone any distance at
all when something seized his leg and sent

746
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:42,870
him flying through the air. He saw the ground
suddenly move towards his face, and then - nothing.

747
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,279
CHAPTER NINE

748
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,480
In the Coach and Horses

749
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:53,810
At the time when Mr Marvel went into the inn,
Mr Cuss and Mr Bunting were in the parlour,

750
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,950
searching the stranger's property in the hope
of finding something to explain the events

751
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:05,540
of the morning. Jaffers had recovered from
his fall and had gone home. Mrs Hall had tidied

752
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:10,949
the stranger's clothes and put them away.
And under the window where the stranger did

753
01:09:10,949 --> 01:09:16,230
his work, Mr Cuss found three big books.

754
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:21,909
'Now,' said Cuss, 'we shall learn something.'

755
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:27,350
But when they opened the books they could
read nothing Cuss turned the pages.

756
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:32,900
'Dear me,' he said, 'I can't understand.'

757
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:38,060
'No pictures, nothing to show-?' asked Mr
Bunting.

758
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:45,460
'See for yourself,' said Mr Cuss, 'it's all
Greek or Russian or some other language.'

759
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:52,750
The door opened suddenly. Both men looked
round. It was Mr Marvel. He held the door

760
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,890
open for a moment.

761
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,650
'I beg your pardon,' he said.

762
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:04,760
'Please shut that door,' said Mr Cuss, and
Mr Marvel went out. 'My nerves - my nerves

763
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:11,870
are in pieces today,' said Mr Cuss. 'It made
me jump when the door opened like that.'

764
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:19,050
Mr Bunting smiled. 'Now let us look at the
books again. It's true that strange things

765
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:24,560
have been happening in the village. But of
course I can't believe in an invisible man.

766
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,610
I can't.'

767
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:30,860
'No. Though I tell you I saw right down his
sleeve.'

768
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:35,790
'But are you sure?' said Mr Bunting. 'Are
you quite sure?'

769
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:43,350
'Quite. I've said so. There's no doubt at
all. Now let's look at these books.'

770
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:49,440
They turned over the pages, unable to read
a word of their strange language. Suddenly

771
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,930
Mr Bunting felt something take hold of the
back of his neck. He was unable to lift his

772
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:55,930
head.

773
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:00,930
'Don't move, little men, or I'll knock your
brains out.'

774
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:05,040
Mr Bunting looked at Cuss, whose face had
turned white with fear.

775
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,960
'I am sorry to be rough,' said the Voice.
'Since when did you learn to look through

776
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,850
other men's possessions?'

777
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:20,949
Two noses struck the table. 'To come unasked
into a stranger's private room! Listen. I

778
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:27,310
am a strong man. I could kill you both and
escape unseen, if I wanted to. If I let you

779
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:31,650
go, you must promise to do as I tell you.'

780
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:34,540
'Yes,' said Mr Bunting.

781
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:41,490
Then the hands let their necks go and the
two men sat up, now very red in the face.

782
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:48,930
'Don't move,' said the Voice. 'Here's the
poker, you see.' They saw the poker dance

783
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,239
in the air. It touched Mr Bunting's nose.

784
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:59,560
'Now, where are my clothes? Just now, though
the days are quite warm enough for an invisible

785
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,719
man to run about without anything on, the
evenings are cold. I want some clothes. And

786
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:11,370
I must also have those three books.'

787
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,610
CHAPTER TEN

788
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,710
The Invisible Man Loses His Temper

789
01:12:15,710 --> 01:12:23,620
While these things were going on in the parlour,
and while Mr Huxter was watching Mr Marvel

790
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:29,739
as he leaned smoking his pipe against the
gate, Mr Hall and Teddy Henfrey stood talking

791
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:31,850
nearby.

792
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:38,239
Suddenly there came a loud knock on the door
of the parlour, a cry, and then - silence.

793
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:48,949
'Hel-lo!' said Teddy Henfrey. 'Hel-lo!' from
the bar. Mr Hall and Teddy looked at the door.

794
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:52,330
'Something's wrong,' said Hall.

795
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:57,900
For a long time they listened. Strange noises
were coming from behind the closed door, as

796
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,310
if something was falling about. Then a sharp
cry.

797
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,130
'No! No, you don't.' Then silence.

798
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:11,590
'What's that?' exclaimed Henfrey in a low
voice.

799
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:16,610
'Is everything all right there?' called Hall.

800
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:24,430
'Quite ri-ight,' came Mr Bunting's voice,
'qui-ite! Don't come in!'

801
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:27,159
They stood listening.

802
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:34,880
'I can't', they heard Mr Bunting say. 'I tell
you, sir, I will not.'

803
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,280
'Who's that speaking now?' asked Henfrey.

804
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:44,750
'Mr Cuss, I suppose,' said Hall. 'Can you
hear anything?'

805
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,210
Silence.

806
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:51,680
'Someone is throwing the table around,' said
Hall.

807
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:57,320
Mrs Hall appeared behind the bar. When they
told her, she would not believe anything strange

808
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:02,580
was happening. Perhaps they were moving the
chairs and table.

809
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,340
'Didn't I hear the window?' said Henfrey.

810
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,100
'What window?' asked Mrs Hall.

811
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:13,409
'The parlour window,' said Henfrey.

812
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:19,699
Everyone stood listening. Mrs Hall, looking
straight in front of her, saw, without seeing,

813
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:25,560
the bright shape of the inn door, the white
road, and Huxter's shop-front shining in the

814
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:33,560
June sun. Suddenly Huxter's door opened, and
Huxter appeared, his eyes staring with excitement,

815
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,679
his arms waving in the air.

816
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:42,970
'Stop thief!' cried Huxter, and he ran towards
the yard gates and disappeared.

817
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:49,670
At the same time a noise came from the parlour,
and there was the sound of windows being closed.

818
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:55,950
Hall, Henfrey, and everyone in the bar rushed
out into the street. They saw someone run

819
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:01,810
round the corner towards the hill road, and
Mr Huxter jump into the air and fall on his

820
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:08,480
face and shoulder. Hall and two workmen ran
down the street and saw Mr Marvel disappearing

821
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,170
past the church wall.

822
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:18,130
But Hall had hardly run 12 yards when he gave
a loud shout and fell on his side, pulling

823
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:25,430
one of the workmen with him. The second workman
came up, and he too was knocked down. They

824
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:30,889
came the rush of the village crowd. The first
man was surprised to see Huxter and Hall on

825
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:37,739
the ground. Suddenly something happened to
his feet, and he was lying on his back, the

826
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:43,969
crowd was falling over him, and he was being
sworn at by a number of angry people.

827
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:48,910
When Hall, Henfrey and the workmen ran out
of the house Mrs Hall had remained in the

828
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:56,140
bar. Suddenly the parlour door was opened,
Mr Cuss appeared and, without looking at her,

829
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:59,410
rushed down the steps towards the corner of
the street.

830
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:06,370
'Hold him!' he cried. 'Don't let him drop
those books and clothes! You can see him so

831
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,600
long as he holds them.'

832
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:13,830
He knew nothing of Marvel; for the Invisible
Man had handed over the books and clothes

833
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:19,800
to him in the yard. The face of Mr Cuss was
angry and determined, but there was something

834
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,920
wrong with his clothes: he was wearing a tablecloth.

835
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:31,159
'Hold him!' he shouted. 'He's got my trousers
- and all the vicar's clothes!'

836
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:35,720
Coming round the corner to join the crowd,
he was knocked off his feet and lay kicking

837
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:42,389
on the ground. Somebody stepped on his finger.
He struggled to his feet, something knocked

838
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:47,590
against him and threw him on his knees again,
and he saw that everyone was running back

839
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:54,620
to the village. He rose again, and was hit
behind the ear. He set off straight back to

840
01:16:54,620 --> 01:17:00,020
the village inn as fast as he could run, and
on his way jumped over the body of Huxter,

841
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,679
who was now sitting up.

842
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:08,900
Behind him, as he was halfway up the inn steps,
he heard a sudden cry of anger above the noise,

843
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:15,370
and the sound of someone being struck in the
face. He knew the voice as that of the Invisible

844
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,100
Man.

845
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,090
In another moment Mr Cuss was back in the
parlour.

846
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:25,929
'He's coming back, Bunting!' he said, rushing
in. 'Save yourself!'

847
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:31,280
Mr Bunting was standing in the window, trying
to dress himself in the curtains and a newspaper.

848
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:36,750
'Who's coming?' he said, so surprised that
his dress nearly fell off him.

849
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:42,760
'The Invisible Man!' said Cuss, and rushed
to the window. 'We'd better move - quick.

850
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,670
He's fighting like a madman!' In another moment
he was out in the yard.

851
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:54,020
Mr Bunting heard a frightful struggle in the
passage of the inn, and decided to leave.

852
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:58,950
He climbed out of the window, and ran up the
village street as fast as his fat little legs

853
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:02,980
could carry him.

854
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,219
CHAPTER ELEVEN

855
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:09,699
Mr Marvel Tries to Say No

856
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:16,050
Mr Marvel was walking painfully through the
thick woods on the road to Bramblehurst. He

857
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:22,560
looked very unhappy and was carrying three
books and some clothes wrapped in a blue tablecloth.

858
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,660
A Voice went with him and he was held tightly
by unseen hands.

859
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:33,080
'If you try to escape again,' said the Voice,
'I will kill you.'

860
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,640
'I didn't try to escape,' said Mr Marvel.

861
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:43,620
The Voice swore a few times and then stopped.
Mr Marvel, who was not used to so much work,

862
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:51,101
was very tired. There was silence for a time.
Then, 'I shall have to make use of you. You

863
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:54,150
are a poor creature, but I must.'

864
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:56,969
'Yes, I am,' said Marvel.

865
01:18:56,969 --> 01:18:59,520
'You are,' said the Voice.

866
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:07,150
'I'm not strong,' said Marvel. Then after
a short silence he repeated, 'I'm not strong.

867
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:11,380
I've got a weak heart. I can't do what you
want.'

868
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,140
'I'll make you,' said the Voice.

869
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:17,909
'I wish I was dead,' said Marvel.

870
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:22,380
'Go on! Walk! Move!' said the Voice.

871
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,690
'It's cruel,' said Marvel.

872
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:31,280
'Be quiet,' said the Voice. 'I'll see that
you're all right. But be quiet. I want to

873
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,889
think.'

874
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:34,940
Soon they saw the lights of a village.

875
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:40,810
'I shall keep my hand on your shoulder,' said
the Voice. 'Go straight through the village,

876
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:46,730
and don't try to say anything to anybody.'

877
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,280
CHAPTER TWELVE

878
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,219
At Port Stowe

879
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:57,820
At ten o'clock the next morning Mr Marvel,
dirty, tired, and worried, sat outside a little

880
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:05,560
inn at Port Stowe. Beside him were the books,
but now they were tied up with string. He

881
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:13,241
had left the clothes in the woods beyond Bramblehurst.
Mr Marvel sat on a wooden seat and, although

882
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:18,310
no one took any notice of him, he seemed excited.

883
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:23,700
When he had been sitting for nearly an hour
an old sailor, with a newspaper in his hand,

884
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,260
came out of the inn and sat down beside him.

885
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:32,040
'Pleasant day,' said the sailor.

886
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:38,929
Mr Marvel looked around him with eyes that
were full of terror. 'Very,' he replied.

887
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:44,679
The sailor looked around him as if he had
nothing to do, and then at Mr Marvel's dusty

888
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:51,690
clothes and the books beside him. He had heard
the sound of money being dropped into a pocket,

889
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:56,800
and thought that Mr Marvel did not look like
a man who would carry much money.

890
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,489
'Books?' he said suddenly.

891
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:05,400
Mr Marvel jumped and looked at them. 'Oh,
yes,' he said. 'Yes, they're books.'

892
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,840
'There are some strange things in books,'
said the sailor.

893
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,880
'There are,' said Mr Marvel.

894
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,850
'And some strange things out of them,' said
the sailor.

895
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,340
'True,' said Mr Marvel.

896
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:26,610
'There are some strange things in newspapers,
for example,' said the sailor.

897
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:27,949
'There are.'

898
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:32,239
'In this newspaper,' said the sailor.

899
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,070
'Ah!' said Mr Marvel.

900
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:43,780
'There's a story,' said the sailor, 'there's
a story about an Invisible Man.' And he told

901
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:50,160
Mr Marvel as much of the story as the newspaper
contained. 'I don't like it,' he said. 'He

902
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:57,429
might be anywhere, might be here at this moment
listening to us. And just think, if he wanted

903
01:21:57,429 --> 01:22:02,370
to steal or kill, what is there to stop him?'

904
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:05,989
Mr Marvel seemed to be listening for the least
sound.

905
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:15,080
'Ah - and - well-' he said. And lowering his
voice, 'I know something about this Invisible

906
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,080
Man.'

907
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,179
'Oh,' said the sailor, 'you?'

908
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:22,900
'Yes,' said Mr Marvel, 'me.'

909
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:26,430
The sailor did not seem to believe Mr Marvel.

910
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:33,360
'It happened like this,' Mr Marvel began,
and then his expression changed suddenly.

911
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,110
'Ow!' he said. He rose stiffly from his seat,
as if in pain.

912
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,600
'What's the matter?' said the sailor.

913
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:45,020
'I - I think I must be going,' said Mr Marvel.

914
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:50,909
'But you were just going to tell me about
this Invisible Man,' said the sailor.

915
01:22:50,909 --> 01:22:53,239
Mr Marvel seemed to think carefully.

916
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:56,230
'A lie,' said a Voice.

917
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:59,679
'It's a lie,' said Mr Marvel.

918
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,219
'But it's in the paper,' said the sailor.

919
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:09,740
'Yes,' said Mr Marvel loudly, 'but it's a
lie. I know the man who started it. There

920
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,100
isn't any Invisible Man at all.'

921
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,110
'But this paper? Do you mean to say-?'

922
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:19,440
'Not a word of truth in it,' said Mr Marvel
firmly.

923
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,660
The sailor stared, the paper in his hand.
Mr Marvel turned round.

924
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:32,199
'Wait a bit,' said the sailor, rising and
speaking slowly. 'Do you mean to say-?'

925
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:34,920
'I do,' said Mr Marvel.

926
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:40,410
'Then why did you let me go on and tell you
all this, then? What do you mean by letting

927
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:44,510
a man make a fool of himself like that for,
eh?'

928
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:50,780
'Come along,' said a Voice, and Mr Marvel
was suddenly turned round and he started marching

929
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,360
off in a strange, jumpy manner.

930
01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:00,199
'Silly devil,' said the sailor, legs wide
apart, watching the little man go. 'I'll show

931
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:06,180
you, you silly fool! It's here in the paper!'

932
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:10,620
And there was another strange thing he was
soon to hear about, that had happened quite

933
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:18,290
close to him. And that was a 'hand full of
money' travelling by itself along by the wall.

934
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:23,960
A sailor friend had seen this strange sight
that very morning. He had tried to take the

935
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:29,489
money and had been knocked down by an unseen
hand, and when he had got to his feet the

936
01:24:29,489 --> 01:24:31,920
money had disappeared.

937
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,909
The story of the flying money was true. And
all round that neighbourhood, even from the

938
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:45,350
bank, from shops and inns, money had quietly
walked away. And it had found its way into

939
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:52,100
Mr Marvel's pocket, so the sailor had heard.

940
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,949
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

941
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:57,369
The Man in a Hurry

942
01:24:57,369 --> 01:25:04,620
In the early evening time, Dr Kemp was sitting
in his study on the hill above Burdock. It

943
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:11,010
was a pleasant little upstairs room, with
three windows - north, west, and south - with

944
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:18,450
bookshelves crowded with books and with a
broad writing table. Dr Kemp was a tall, thin

945
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:25,110
man of about thirty-five, with fair hair.
He was writing.

946
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:32,540
His eye, soon wandering from his work, caught
the sunset behind the hill opposite his house.

947
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:39,500
For a minute, perhaps, he sat, pen in mouth,
admiring the rich golden colour, and then

948
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:46,159
he saw the little figure of a man running
over the hill towards him. He was a shortest

949
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:51,639
little man, in a dirty old hat, and he was
running fast.

950
01:25:51,639 --> 01:25:57,510
Dr Kemp got up, went to the window, and stared
at the hillside and the dark little figure

951
01:25:57,510 --> 01:26:04,699
running down it. 'He seems to be in a hurry,'
said Dr Kemp to himself.

952
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:09,760
Then the running man was hidden behind some
houses; he came into sight and disappeared

953
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,080
again - still running.

954
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:19,060
But those who were nearer to him saw the terror
in his face. He looked neither to the right

955
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:24,619
nor left, but his wide eyes stared straight
down the hill to where the lamps were being

956
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:30,810
lit and there were people crowding together
in the street. Everybody he passed stopped

957
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:36,449
and began staring up and down the road, and
asking one another, half afraid, why the man

958
01:26:36,449 --> 01:26:38,800
was running so hard.

959
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:45,530
And then, far up the hill, a dog playing in
the road growled and ran under a gate, and

960
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:51,290
something - a wind - a noise of feet, a sound
like heavy breathing - rushed by.

961
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:57,770
People cried out. People jumped off the footpath.
They shouted as the thing rushed past them

962
01:26:57,770 --> 01:27:04,300
down the hill, and they were still shouting
in the street before Marvel was halfway there.

963
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:09,930
They were running into houses with the news
and shutting the doors behind them. He heard

964
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:17,730
it, and ran even faster. Fear came hurrying
by, rushed ahead of him, and in a moment had

965
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,570
seized the town.

966
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:27,370
'The Invisible Man is coming! The Invisible
Man!'

967
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:29,949
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

968
01:27:29,949 --> 01:27:33,310
In the Happy Cricketers

969
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:39,560
At the bottom of the hill was an inn called
the Happy Cricketers. Inside, the barman leant

970
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:45,989
his fat red arms on the table and talked about
horses with a cabman, while a black-bearded

971
01:27:45,989 --> 01:27:49,330
man who spoke like an American talked to a
policeman.

972
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:56,280
'What's the shouting about?' said the cabman,
trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow

973
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:02,030
curtains in the low window of the inn. Somebody
ran past outside.

974
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:05,699
'Fire, perhaps,' said the barman.

975
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:13,139
The door was pushed open, and Marvel, crying,
his hat gone, the neck of his coat torn open,

976
01:28:13,139 --> 01:28:18,850
rushed in and tried to shut the door. It was
held half open by a door-stop.

977
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:28,820
'Coming!' he cried, his voice cracked with
terror. 'He's coming. The Invisible Man! After

978
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:32,010
me. Help! Help! Help!'

979
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:38,960
'Shut the doors,' said the policeman. 'Who's
coming? What's the matter?' He went to the

980
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,929
door and removed the door-stop, and the door
shut with a bang. The man with the beard closed

981
01:28:44,929 --> 01:28:46,360
the other door.

982
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:54,530
'Let me hide,' said Marvel, with tears running
down his face. 'Let me hide. Lock me in somewhere.

983
01:28:54,530 --> 01:29:00,949
I tell you he's after me. I escaped. He said
he'd kill me, and he will.'

984
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:09,220
'You're safe,' said the man with the black
beard. 'The door's shut. What's it all about?'

985
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:15,540
'Let me hide,' said Marvel, and cried aloud
as a blow suddenly made the locked door shake.

986
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:20,469
The blow was followed by a hurried knocking
and a shouting outside.

987
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:23,820
'Hello,' cried the policeman, 'who's there?'

988
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:30,360
'He'll kill me,' shouted Mr Marvel, 'he's
got a knife or something. Don't open the door.

989
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:34,420
Please don't open the door. Where shall I
hide?'

990
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:40,619
'Is this the Invisible Man, then?' asked the
black-bearded man, with one hand behind him.

991
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:47,151
'I think it's about time we saw him.' The
window of the inn was suddenly broken in,

992
01:29:47,151 --> 01:29:52,870
and there were shouts, and people running
about in the street. The policeman had been

993
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:58,790
standing on a chair, looking out of the window
to see who was at the door. He got down. 'That's

994
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:05,250
who it is' he said. The barman stood in front
of the parlour door, where Mr Marvel was now

995
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:12,690
locked in, and stared at the broken window.
Then he came round to the two other men.

996
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:18,360
Everything was suddenly quiet. 'I wish I had
my stick,' said the policeman. 'If we open

997
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,350
the door, he'll come in. Nothing can stop
him.'

998
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:26,270
'Don't be in too much of a hurry about that
door,' said the cabman anxiously.

999
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:32,860
'Unlock it,' said the man with the black beard,
'and if he comes...' He showed them the revolver

1000
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,190
in his hand.

1001
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:38,120
'That won't do,' said the policeman; 'that's
murder.'

1002
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,330
'I know what country I'm in,' said the man
with the beard 'I'm going to shoot at his

1003
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:46,390
legs. Unlock it.'

1004
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:49,310
'Not with that thing going off behind me,'
said the barman.

1005
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:55,700
'Very well,' said the man with the black beard.
He stepped forward with his gun ready, and

1006
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:02,060
unlocked the door himself. Barman, cabman
and policeman turned around.

1007
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:08,409
'Come in,' said the bearded man in a low voice,
standing back and facing the door with his

1008
01:31:08,409 --> 01:31:14,380
gun behind him. No one came in and the door
remained closed.

1009
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:21,600
'Are all the doors of the house shut?' asked
Marvel, five minutes later. 'He's going round

1010
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,730
to the back.'

1011
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:30,619
'There's the yard door,' said the barman,
'and the private door. The yard door-'

1012
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:33,010
He rushed out of the bar.

1013
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:38,679
In a minute he appeared again with a long
sharp knife in his hand. 'The yard door was

1014
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:40,110
open,' he said.

1015
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:44,440
'He may be in the house now,' said the cabman.

1016
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:50,650
The man with the beard put the gun back in
his pocket. As he did so, the door opened,

1017
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:56,810
something rushed past them, and the parlour
door burst open. They heard Marvel cry out

1018
01:31:56,810 --> 01:32:02,310
and ran to his rescue. The bearded man's revolver
went off, and the mirror at the back of the

1019
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:05,970
parlour came crashing down on the floor.

1020
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:11,100
As the barman came into the room, he saw Marvel
struggling against the door that led to the

1021
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:17,750
yard and kitchen. The door flew open and Marvel
was dragged into the kitchen.

1022
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:23,760
The policeman, who had been trying to pass
the barman rushed in, followed by the cabman,

1023
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,970
caught hold of the invisible hand that held
Marvel, was hit in the face and fell down.

1024
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:32,250
Then the cabman took hold of something.

1025
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:35,350
'I've got him,' said the cabman.

1026
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:38,850
'Here he is!' said the barman.

1027
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:43,680
Mr Marvel suddenly dropped to the ground,
and made an attempt to hide behind the legs

1028
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:50,449
of the fighting men. The struggle went backwards
and forwards near the door. The voice of the

1029
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:55,920
Invisible Man was heard for the first time,
as the policeman stepped on his foot. Then

1030
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,159
he cried out, and his arms flew out. The cabman
was suddenly knocked to the ground by a kick

1031
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:07,731
in the stomach. The door into the bar parlour
from the kitchen shut with a bang as Mr Marvel

1032
01:33:07,731 --> 01:33:13,219
escaped through it. The men in the kitchen
found themselves struggling with empty air.

1033
01:33:13,219 --> 01:33:17,980
'Where's he gone?' cried the man with the
beard. 'Out?'

1034
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:22,750
'This way,' said the policeman, stepping into
the yard and stopping.

1035
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:27,540
A large stone flew by his head and fell on
the kitchen table.

1036
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:33,500
'I'll show him,' shouted the man with the
black beard and he fired five rapid shots

1037
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:38,770
in the direction the stone had come from.
As he fired, the man with the beard moved

1038
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:44,880
his hand slightly, so that his shots went
from one side to the other of the narrow yard.

1039
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:52,830
A silence followed. 'Come along,' he said,
'and feel around for his body.'

1040
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:54,969
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1041
01:33:54,969 --> 01:33:58,969
Dr Kemp's Visitor

1042
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:05,280
Dr Kemp was writing in his study when he heard
the shots. Crack, crack, crack, they came,

1043
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,020
one after the other.

1044
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:12,820
'Hello!' said Dr Kemp to himself, putting
his pen into his mouth again and listening.

1045
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:18,190
'Who's letting off guns in Burdock? What are
they doing now?'

1046
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:24,791
He went to the south window, threw it up and,
leaning out, stared down on the town. 'It

1047
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:31,450
looks like a crowd down by the Happy Cricketers,'
he said to himself. Then his eyes wandered

1048
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:37,040
over the town to far away where the ships'
lights shone. The moon in its first quarter

1049
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,520
hung over the hill to the west, and the stars
were clear and bright.

1050
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:47,460
Five minutes later, Dr Kemp pulled down the
window again, and returned to his writing

1051
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:49,020
desk.

1052
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:56,330
It must have been about an hour after this
that the front-door bell rang. He sat listening.

1053
01:34:56,330 --> 01:35:01,870
He heard the servant go to the door, and waited
for the sound of her feet on the staircase,

1054
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:03,610
but she did not come.

1055
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:07,630
'What was that about?' Dr Kemp asked himself.

1056
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:15,560
He tried to go on with his work, failed, and
went downstairs. He rang the bell and called

1057
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,760
to the servant as she appeared in the hall.

1058
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,750
'Was that a letter?' he asked.

1059
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:26,619
'Only the bell ringing, sir, and no one there,'
she answered.

1060
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:32,100
'I'm restless tonight,' he said to himself.
He went back to his study.

1061
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:37,179
Soon afterwards he was hard at work again,
and his room was silent except for the sounds

1062
01:35:37,179 --> 01:35:42,430
of the clock and his pen moving over the paper.

1063
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:47,840
It was two o'clock before he had finished
his work for the night. He rose and went upstairs

1064
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:54,850
to bed. When he had taken off his coat and
shirt, he felt thirsty. He took a lamp and

1065
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:59,180
went down to the dining room in search of
a drink.

1066
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:05,060
Dr Kemp's scientific work had trained him
to notice things quickly. As he crossed the

1067
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:11,659
hall, he saw a dark spot on the floor near
the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then

1068
01:36:11,659 --> 01:36:17,540
he asked himself what the dark spot on the
floor might be. He went back to the hall,

1069
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:25,450
and, bending down, touched the spot. It looked
and felt like drying blood.

1070
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:31,659
He returned upstairs, looking around him and
thinking about the blood spot. Then suddenly

1071
01:36:31,659 --> 01:36:38,489
he saw something which made him stop. There
was blood on the handle of his door.

1072
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:44,139
He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean.
Then he remembered that the door of his room

1073
01:36:44,139 --> 01:36:49,929
had been open when he came down from his study,
and that he had not touched the handle at

1074
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:56,080
all. He went straight into his bedroom, his
face quite calm - perhaps a little more determined

1075
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:04,369
than usual... He looked at the bed. There
was a pool of blood, and the sheet was torn.

1076
01:37:04,369 --> 01:37:09,591
He had not noticed this when he had been in
the room before. The other side of the bed

1077
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:13,260
looked as if someone had been lying on it.

1078
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:23,330
Then he seemed to hear a low voice say, 'Help
me! - Kemp!' But Dr Kemp did not believe in

1079
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:24,650
'voices'.

1080
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:31,010
He stood staring at the sheets. Was it really
a voice? He looked around him again, and noticed

1081
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:37,810
nothing. But he clearly heard something move
across the room. A strange feeling came over

1082
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:43,739
him. He closed the door of the room and came
forward. Suddenly, with a shock, he saw a

1083
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:48,369
bloody bandage hanging in the air between
him and the bed.

1084
01:37:48,369 --> 01:37:55,640
He stared at it in surprise. It was an empty
bandage - a bandage properly tied, but quite

1085
01:37:55,640 --> 01:38:02,480
empty. He would have moved forward to take
hold of it, but a touch stopped him and a

1086
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,489
voice spoke quite close to him.

1087
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:08,010
'Kemp!' said the Voice.

1088
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:11,949
'Eh!' said Kemp, with his mouth open.

1089
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:16,820
Said the Voice, 'I'm an invisible man.'

1090
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:24,400
Kemp made no answer for a moment or two, but
simply stared at the bandage. 'The Invisible

1091
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,560
Man?' he said at last.

1092
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,599
'I'm an invisible man,' repeated the Voice.

1093
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:37,619
'I thought it was a lie,' he said. 'Have you
got a bandage on?' he asked.

1094
01:38:37,619 --> 01:38:40,420
'Yes,' said the Invisible Man.

1095
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:48,060
'Oh!' said Kemp, and then, 'I say! But this
is nonsense. It's some trick.' He stepped

1096
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:53,770
forward suddenly, stretched out his hand towards
the bandage and met invisible fingers.

1097
01:38:53,770 --> 01:39:03,230
'Keep steady, Kemp, in God's name! I want
help badly. Stop!' The hand seized his arm.

1098
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:08,119
He struck at it. 'Kemp!' cried the Voice.
'Kemp, keep still!'

1099
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:14,409
A desire to free himself took hold of Kemp.
But the hand held his shoulder, and he was

1100
01:39:14,409 --> 01:39:19,810
suddenly pushed and fell backwards upon the
bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the

1101
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:25,489
corner of the sheet was pushed between his
teeth. The Invisible Man held him down, but

1102
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:28,750
his arms were free, and he hit back fiercely.

1103
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:35,850
'Listen to reason, will you?' said the Invisible
Man. 'By heaven, you'll make me mad! Stop

1104
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:39,780
struggling and lie still! Lie still!'

1105
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,490
Kemp struggled for another moment, and then
lay still.

1106
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:51,469
'Let me get up,' he said. 'I'll stay where
I am. And let me sit quiet for a minute.'

1107
01:39:51,469 --> 01:39:55,140
He sat up and felt his neck.

1108
01:39:55,140 --> 01:40:02,530
'I'm just an ordinary man - a man you used
to know - made invisible. Do you remember

1109
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:03,570
Griffin?'

1110
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:06,679
'Griffin?' repeated Kemp.

1111
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:12,610
'Griffin,' answered the Voice. 'A younger
student than you.'

1112
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:15,679
'What has this to do with Griffin?'

1113
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,989
'I am Griffin.'

1114
01:40:18,989 --> 01:40:25,730
Kemp laughed. 'It's too much of a shock,'
he said. 'But what devil's work can make a

1115
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:27,300
man invisible?'

1116
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,170
'It's no devil's work. It's honest and simple
enough.'

1117
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:35,349
'It's terrible!' said Kemp. 'How on earth-?'

1118
01:40:35,349 --> 01:40:43,360
'I'm wounded and in pain, and tired... Great
God! Kemp, you are a man. Keep calm. Give

1119
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:49,370
me some food and drink, and let me sit down
here.'

1120
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:54,489
Kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across
the room, then saw a chair slide along the

1121
01:40:54,489 --> 01:41:02,370
floor and come to rest near the bed. It made
a noise, and the seat sank slightly. He rubbed

1122
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:05,200
his eyes and felt his neck again.

1123
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,660
'This beats magic,' he said, and laughed stupidly.

1124
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:14,780
'That's better. Thank heaven, you're becoming
sensible!'

1125
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:19,760
'Or silly,' said Kemp, and rubbed his eyes
again.

1126
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,530
'Give me something to drink. I'm nearly dead.'

1127
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:31,250
'It didn't feel like that. Where are you?
If I get up, shall I run into you? There!

1128
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:38,110
All right. A drink... Here. Where shall I
give it you?'

1129
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:44,540
Kemp felt the glass taken out of his hand.
He let it go into the air. It came to rest

1130
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:51,260
just in front of the chair seat. He stared
at it. 'This... I don't believe it... I must

1131
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,280
be mad.'

1132
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:58,739
'Nonsense!' said the Voice. 'Listen to me.
I'm hungry, and the night is cold to a man

1133
01:41:58,739 --> 01:42:00,830
with no clothes on.'

1134
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:03,139
'Food?' offered Kemp.

1135
01:42:03,139 --> 01:42:05,020
The glass emptied itself.

1136
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:10,940
'Yes,' said the Invisible Man, putting it
down. 'Can you give me something to wear?'

1137
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:15,030
Kemp found some clothes. 'These?' he asked.

1138
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:20,610
They were taken from him. They hung in the
air, buttoned themselves and sat down in the

1139
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,610
chair.

1140
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:26,250
'The maddest thing I've ever seen in my life,'
said Kemp.

1141
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,200
'Some food?'

1142
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,730
Kemp went to the kitchen for some bread and
some meat, returned and put them on a table

1143
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,659
in front of his guest.

1144
01:42:34,659 --> 01:42:40,560
'Never mind about a knife,' said the Invisible
Man: and a piece of meat hung in the air and

1145
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,010
disappeared with a sound of eating.

1146
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:48,070
'I always like to have clothes on when I eat,'
said the Voice.

1147
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:51,110
'Is your arm all right?'

1148
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:53,179
'Not very painful.'

1149
01:42:53,179 --> 01:42:56,320
'It's all mad, as mad as can be.'

1150
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,910
'Quite reasonable,' said the Invisible Man.

1151
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:06,450
'But how's it done?' began Kemp. 'What were
the shots?' he asked. 'How did the shooting

1152
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:07,450
begin?'

1153
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:15,210
'There was a man - I tried to make him help
me! - who tried to steal my money. And he

1154
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:16,510
has stolen it.'

1155
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:18,720
'Is he invisible too?'

1156
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,720
'No.'

1157
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,720
'Well?'

1158
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:28,510
'Can't I have some more to eat before I tell
you all about it? I'm hungry - in pain. And

1159
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:31,270
you want me to tell stories!'

1160
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:36,000
Kemp got up. 'You didn't do any shooting?'
he asked.

1161
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,850
'Not me,' said his visitor. 'Some fool fired,
a man I'd never seen before. A lot of them

1162
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:49,810
got frightened. They all got frightened of
me. I say - I want more to eat than this,

1163
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,810
Kemp.'

1164
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:57,200
'I'll see whether there's anything more to
eat downstairs,' said Kemp. 'Not much, I'm

1165
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,200
afraid.'

1166
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:04,690
Kemp found some more food. And when his guest
had eaten he told him to try to get some sleep.

1167
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:09,930
Though the Invisible Man was wounded and tired,
he refused to accept Kemp's word that no one

1168
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:15,770
would try to seize him. He examined the two
windows of the bedroom, pulled up the blinds

1169
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:20,080
and opened the windows to see whether it was
possible to get out that way, as Kemp had

1170
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:26,030
told him. Outside the night was very quiet
and still, and the new moon was setting over

1171
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:33,480
the hill. Then he examined the key of the
bedroom door. At last he was satisfied. He

1172
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,730
stood by the fireside and Kemp heard his breathing
relax.

1173
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:45,090
'I'm sorry,' said the Invisible Man, 'if I
cannot tell you all that I've done tonight,

1174
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:54,429
but I'm so tired. It's foolish, no doubt.
It's horrible! But, believe me, Kemp, in spite

1175
01:44:54,429 --> 01:45:02,810
of your arguments, it's quite a possible thing.
I've made a discovery. I intended to keep

1176
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:12,159
it secret. I can't. I must have someone to
help me. And you... We can do such great things

1177
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:21,639
together... But tomorrow. Now, Kemp, I feel
as though I must sleep or die.'

1178
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:26,760
They said goodnight to each other, and Kemp
stayed in his room, thinking. He picked up

1179
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:33,080
a newspaper and found that it was full of
reports of the Invisible Man. As he read,

1180
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:38,969
he began to feel afraid of what his guest
might do if he was allowed to stay free. He

1181
01:45:38,969 --> 01:45:47,630
wrote a note and addressed it to 'Colonel
Adye, Port Burdock'

1182
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:50,090
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1183
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:54,270
How to Become Invisible

1184
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:58,670
The next morning Kemp heard a loud noise and
went to see his guest.

1185
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:02,710
'What's the matter?' asked Kemp, when the
Invisible Man let him in.

1186
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:06,099
'Nothing,' was the answer.

1187
01:46:06,099 --> 01:46:09,670
'But, good heavens! What was that crash?'

1188
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:16,619
'I lost my temper,' said the Invisible Man.
'I forgot this arm; and it's sore.'

1189
01:46:16,619 --> 01:46:19,560
'You're rather in the habit of losing your
temper.'

1190
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,810
'I am.'

1191
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:25,830
'Your story is in the papers,' Kemp said.

1192
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:27,460
The Invisible Man swore.

1193
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:32,710
'Come and have some breakfast,' said Kemp,
leading the way. 'Before we can do anything

1194
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:40,020
else,' he went on, 'I must understand a little
more about you.' He had sat down, with the

1195
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:42,420
air of a man who means to talk seriously.

1196
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,030
'It's simple enough,' said Griffin.

1197
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:51,199
'No doubt it's simple enough to you, but-'
Kemp laughed.

1198
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:58,740
'Well, yes, to me it seemed strange at first,
no doubt. But we can still do great things!

1199
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:02,620
I found the secret first at Chesilstowe College.'

1200
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,070
'Chesilstowe?'

1201
01:47:04,070 --> 01:47:10,200
'I went there after I left London. You know
I have always been interested in light.'

1202
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,200
'Ah!'

1203
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:18,239
'I said: "I will give my life to this. This
is worth my trouble." You know what fools

1204
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,080
we are at twenty-two.'

1205
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,930
'Fools then and fools now,' said Kemp.

1206
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:30,849
As though just knowing could satisfy a man!
I saw a way to change the human body, or any

1207
01:47:30,849 --> 01:47:37,030
other kind of body...' And then the strange
man, or rather the clothes of a man, sitting

1208
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:43,889
opposite Kemp, explained how a student of
science had disappeared.

1209
01:47:43,889 --> 01:47:50,619
'If you take a small piece of glass and crush
it into powder, the powder is white and solid

1210
01:47:50,619 --> 01:47:59,150
like salt. You can't see through it. Human
flesh, white paper, cloth, hair, are really

1211
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:04,720
made of a kind of powder. The tiny grains
of powder break up the light which shines

1212
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:12,510
on them, so that it can't shine through them,
and that is why we can see flesh and paper.

1213
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:18,929
Now, if you could smooth the broken grains
of powder so that they would not break up

1214
01:48:18,929 --> 01:48:25,469
the light, they would no longer look solid.
The light would shine through them, just as

1215
01:48:25,469 --> 01:48:31,780
now the sun is shining through me. You can
try it with a piece of white paper and a drop

1216
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:39,170
of oil. Pour a little oil on the paper and
things will begin to show through it. If the

1217
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:44,469
oil is good enough and the paper is bad enough,
you will be able to see through the paper

1218
01:48:44,469 --> 01:48:51,460
to the print on the other side. That is because
the oil is smooth and it smooths out the rough

1219
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:55,580
surfaces of each little grain of the powder.

1220
01:48:55,580 --> 01:49:03,030
'Well, I found something which would do to
human flesh what the oil does to the paper,

1221
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:08,330
and would do it so perfectly that there is
no tiny part of my body which holds up the

1222
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:15,330
light. It is as if you had taken powdered
glass and turned it back into the unbroken

1223
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:17,849
glass of that window.'

1224
01:49:17,849 --> 01:49:25,060
The explanation, as always between two scientists,
led to all kinds of questions. Kemp was so

1225
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:30,110
surprised at the story that he nearly forgot
that his friend was invisible.

1226
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:37,980
'Yes,' said the Voice, 'I had found it all.
The way was open - and then - then after years

1227
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:45,679
of care and working in secret - then I knew
that I could do nothing. I knew, and I was

1228
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:52,250
helpless. And that was after three years of
secrecy and hard work.'

1229
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:55,540
'Why could you do nothing?' asked Kemp.

1230
01:49:55,540 --> 01:50:01,630
'I had no money,' said the Invisible Man,
and went to stare out of the window.

1231
01:50:01,630 --> 01:50:11,030
He turned round. 'I robbed the old man - robbed
my father. The money was not his, and he shot

1232
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:14,520
himself.'

1233
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,570
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1234
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:19,710
The Experiment

1235
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:24,960
For a moment Kemp sat in silence, staring
at the back of the headless figure at the

1236
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:31,620
window. Then he rose, took the Invisible Man's
arm and turned him away from the view.

1237
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:39,619
'You're tired,' he said, 'and while I'm sitting
down, you walk around. Have my chair.'

1238
01:50:39,619 --> 01:50:43,920
He got up and stood between Griffin and the
nearest window.

1239
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:50,310
For a time Griffin sat silently, and then
he went on with his story.

1240
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:57,739
'I'd already left the College,' he said, 'when
that happened. It was last December. I had

1241
01:50:57,739 --> 01:51:02,139
taken a room in London, in a big house in
Great Portland Street.

1242
01:51:02,139 --> 01:51:08,429
'It was all like a dream, that short visit
to my father in my old home. When I returned

1243
01:51:08,429 --> 01:51:16,030
to my room it seemed like waking from a dream
to reality. Here were the things I knew and

1244
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:22,581
loved. Here was the equipment; the experiments
were arranged and waiting. And now there was

1245
01:51:22,581 --> 01:51:27,199
hardly any difficulty left, beyond the planning
of details.

1246
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:33,960
'I will tell you, Kemp, sooner or later, all
the complicated details. We need not talk

1247
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:41,179
about that now. For the most part, except
for certain words I chose to remember, they

1248
01:51:41,179 --> 01:51:47,659
are written in those books that that tramp
has hidden, in a way that only I can understand.

1249
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:51,369
We must hunt him down.

1250
01:51:51,369 --> 01:51:57,409
'First I tried some white wool. It was the
strangest thing in the world to see it lose

1251
01:51:57,409 --> 01:52:03,930
its substance, like smoke, and disappear.
I could hardly believe I had done it. I put

1252
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:11,210
my hand into the emptiness and there was the
thing as solid as ever. I felt it, and threw

1253
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:15,680
it on the floor. I had a little trouble finding
it again.

1254
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:24,560
'And then I heard a noise behind me and, turning,
saw a white cat, very dirty, outside the window.

1255
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:32,820
A thought came into my head. "Everything is
ready for you," I said, and went to the window,

1256
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:39,050
opened it, and called softly. She came in.
The poor creature was thirsty and I gave her

1257
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:45,179
some milk. After that she went smelling round
the room, plainly with the idea of making

1258
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:51,580
herself at home. The invisible wool upset
her a bit; you should have seen her attack

1259
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:55,329
it! But I made her comfortable on my bed.'

1260
01:52:55,329 --> 01:52:59,090
'And then you made the cat invisible?'

1261
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:02,469
'Yes: it took four hours.'

1262
01:53:02,469 --> 01:53:06,810
'You don't mean to say there's an Invisible
Cat in the world?' said Kemp.

1263
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:12,070
'If it hasn't been killed,' said the Invisible
Man. 'Why not?'

1264
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:16,449
'Why not?' repeated Kemp. 'Go on.'

1265
01:53:16,449 --> 01:53:23,170
He was silent for a few minutes and then continued.
'My only clear thought,' he said, 'was that

1266
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:29,790
the thing had to be completed. And it had
to be done soon, for I had little money left.

1267
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:34,989
After a time I ate some food and went to sleep
in my clothes on my bed.

1268
01:53:34,989 --> 01:53:41,159
'I was woken by a loud knock at the door.
It was the owner of my room. He said I had

1269
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:47,650
been hurting a cat in the night, he was sure.
He wanted to know all about it. I told him

1270
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:53,139
there had been no cat in my room. Then the
noise of my experiments could be heard all

1271
01:53:53,139 --> 01:53:59,290
over the house, he said. That was true, certainly.
He came into the room, asked me what I was

1272
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:06,760
doing, and said it had always been a respectable
house. In the end I got angry, pushed him

1273
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:12,719
out and shut the door. He made some noise
outside, but I didn't listen. After a time

1274
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,240
he went away.

1275
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:21,949
'But I didn't know what he planned to do,
nor even what he had the power to do. To move

1276
01:54:21,949 --> 01:54:27,270
to new rooms would have meant I delay - I
had twenty pounds left in the world, most

1277
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:34,650
of it in a bank. If he brought the police,
my room might be searched. What could I do?

1278
01:54:34,650 --> 01:54:39,040
Disappear! Of course. It was all done that
evening and night.

1279
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:48,310
'There was some pain at first. I felt sick.
At times I cried out. I talked aloud to myself.

1280
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:56,320
But I did not give up. I shall never forget
seeing my hands. They became white as white

1281
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:07,230
paper and then slowly, became like glass.
And then - they had disappeared. At first

1282
01:55:07,230 --> 01:55:11,860
I was weak as a little child, walking on legs
I could not see.

1283
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:17,920
'I slept during the morning, pulling a sheet
over my eyes to shut out the light, and I

1284
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:25,280
was woken again by a knocking. My strength
had returned. I sat up and listened and heard

1285
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:32,820
talking. Soon the knocking was repeated and
voices called. To gain time I answered them.

1286
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:41,060
My window opened on to a roof. I stepped through
it, closed it, stood outside and watched.

1287
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:44,780
The old man and his two sons came into the
room.

1288
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:50,079
'You may imagine their surprise at finding
the room empty. One of the younger men rushed

1289
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:57,409
to the window at once, threw it open and stared
out. His eyes and his thick-lipped, bearded

1290
01:55:57,409 --> 01:56:04,790
face came close to my own. He looked right
through me. So did the others. The old man

1291
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:06,739
went and looked under the bed.

1292
01:56:06,739 --> 01:56:14,000
'While they were all talking together, I came
back into the room, slipped past them, and

1293
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,679
went down the stairs. In one room I found
a box of matches, and when they had come down

1294
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:28,329
I returned to my own room and set fire to
the papers, the bedcovers and the furniture.'

1295
01:56:28,329 --> 01:56:30,469
'You set the house on fire?'

1296
01:56:30,469 --> 01:56:36,909
'Set the house on fire! Yes. It was the only
way to hide my tracks.'

1297
01:56:36,909 --> 01:56:42,540
For the next hour he went on with his story,
and Kemp listened. It was the story of how

1298
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:47,460
the Invisible Man had got some clothes, how
he lived by getting food and drink wherever

1299
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:56,130
he could, of the shelter he found and the
beds he slept in, until he came to Iping.

1300
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:58,070
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

1301
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:59,239
The Plan That Failed

1302
01:56:59,239 --> 01:57:07,560
'But now,' said Kemp, looking out of the window,
'what are we to do?'

1303
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,520
He moved nearer to his guest so that he did
not see the three men who were coming up the

1304
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:15,860
hill road - too slowly, as it seemed to Kemp.

1305
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:23,090
'What were you planning to do, when you were
going to Port Burdock? Did you have a plan?'

1306
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:30,080
'I was going to leave the country. But I have
rather changed that plan since seeing you.

1307
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:36,080
I thought it would be wise, now the weather
is hot, to make for the south. Especially

1308
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:40,829
as my secret was known, and everyone would
be watching for a man all wrapped up like

1309
01:57:40,829 --> 01:57:49,020
me. You have regular boats from here to France.
My idea was to get on board one. Then I could

1310
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:56,100
go by train into Spain, or else to Algiers.
It wouldn't be difficult. There a man could

1311
01:57:56,100 --> 01:58:01,790
be invisible all the time, but still live
and do things. I was using that tramp as a

1312
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:07,350
moneybox and carrier until I decided how to
get my books and things sent over to join

1313
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:09,179
me.'

1314
01:58:09,179 --> 01:58:10,179
'That's clear.'

1315
01:58:10,179 --> 01:58:18,680
'And then he tried to rob me! He has hidden
my books, Kemp. Hidden my books! If I can

1316
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,340
get hold of him, I'll -'

1317
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,960
'You'd better get the books from him first.'

1318
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,710
'But where is he? Do you know?'

1319
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:32,139
'He's in the town police station, locked up,
at his own request, in the strongest room

1320
01:58:32,139 --> 01:58:33,320
in the place.'

1321
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:36,170
'The rat!' said the Invisible Man.

1322
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:39,320
'But that delays your plans a little.'

1323
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:44,250
'We must get those books; those books are
necessary.'

1324
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:51,540
'Certainly,' said Kemp, a little anxiously,
unsure if he heard footsteps outside. 'Certainly

1325
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:57,510
we must get those books. But that won't be
difficult, if he doesn't know they're for

1326
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:58,590
you.'

1327
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:02,489
'No,' said the Invisible Man, thoughtfully.

1328
01:59:02,489 --> 01:59:06,739
Kemp tried to think of something to keep the
conversation going, but the Invisible Man

1329
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:08,290
continued himself.

1330
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:16,969
'Coming into your house, Kemp,' he said, 'changes
all my plans. For you are a man who can understand.

1331
01:59:16,969 --> 01:59:21,870
You are a scientist. You have told no one
I am here?'

1332
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:22,870
'Not a soul.'

1333
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:28,320
'If we are to make any use of being invisible,
we must start by killing.'

1334
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:36,410
'Killing?' repeated Kemp. 'I'm listening to
your plan; but I'm not agreeing. Why killing?'

1335
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:42,560
'The point is this: they know as well as we
do that there is an Invisible Man - and that

1336
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:53,010
Invisible Man, Kemp, must now start to rule
by terror. Yes; I mean it. To rule by terror.

1337
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:59,590
He must take a town like your Burdock and
put the fear of God into it. He must give

1338
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:07,840
orders. He can do that in many ways. And he
must kill everybody who disobeys his orders,

1339
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,949
and everybody who works against him.'

1340
02:00:10,949 --> 02:00:16,050
'Really!' said Kemp, no longer listening to
Griffin, but to the sound of his front door

1341
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:17,599
opening and closing.

1342
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:25,780
The Invisible Man had also heard the sound.
'Listen!' he said. 'What is that downstairs?'

1343
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:32,079
'Nothing,' said Kemp; and suddenly he began
to speak loud and fast. 'I don't agree to

1344
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:37,929
this, Griffin,' he said. 'Understand me, I
don't agree to this. Why do you wish to be

1345
02:00:37,929 --> 02:00:43,409
alone? Why not tell everyone? Think how much
better it would be. You might have a million

1346
02:00:43,409 --> 02:00:44,829
helpers.'

1347
02:00:44,829 --> 02:00:49,700
The Invisible Man raised his hand. 'There
are footsteps coming upstairs,' he said.

1348
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:51,159
'Nonsense,' said Kemp.

1349
02:00:51,159 --> 02:00:58,000
'Let me see,' said the Invisible Man, and
went to the door and listened.

1350
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:04,630
And then things happened very quickly. Suddenly
the clothes sat down and opened as the unseen

1351
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:07,420
man began to undress.

1352
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:09,400
Kemp opened the door.

1353
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:15,139
As he opened it, there came sounds of hurrying
feet and voices downstairs.

1354
02:01:15,139 --> 02:01:20,650
With a quick movement Kemp pushed the Invisible
Man back, jumped aside, and shut the door

1355
02:01:20,650 --> 02:01:26,659
behind him. The key was outside and ready.
In another moment Griffin would have been

1356
02:01:26,659 --> 02:01:33,790
locked in the room, except for one little
thing: the key fell noisily on the floor.

1357
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:39,349
Kemp's face became white. He tried to hold
the door handle with both hands. For a moment

1358
02:01:39,349 --> 02:01:46,469
he pulled at it. Then the door opened slightly,
but he got it closed again. The second time

1359
02:01:46,469 --> 02:01:51,580
it was opened a foot, and the clothes came
into the opening. Kemp's throat was seized

1360
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:57,079
by invisible fingers, and he let go of the
handle in order to defend himself. He was

1361
02:01:57,079 --> 02:02:00,159
forced back and thrown heavily to the floor.

1362
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:06,199
Halfway up the stairs was Colonel Adye, the
chief of the Burdock police. He was staring

1363
02:02:06,199 --> 02:02:11,870
at the sudden appearance of Kemp, followed
by the clothes, which danced in the air. He

1364
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:19,369
saw Kemp fall and then struggle to his feet.
He saw Kemp rush forward, and go down again.

1365
02:02:19,369 --> 02:02:26,540
Then suddenly he was struck. By nothing! A
great weight, if seemed, jumped on him, and

1366
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:33,330
he was thrown down the staircase. An invisible
foot stepped on his back, faint steps passed

1367
02:02:33,330 --> 02:02:38,760
downstairs. He heard the two police officers
in the hall shout and run, and the sound of

1368
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,480
the front door of the house as it shut.

1369
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:48,960
He rolled over and sat up staring. He saw
Kemp coming down the staircase, his face white

1370
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,100
and bleeding.

1371
02:02:50,100 --> 02:03:00,369
'My God!' cried Kemp, 'I couldn't stop him!
He's gone!'

1372
02:03:00,369 --> 02:03:01,630
CHAPTER NINETEEN

1373
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,791
The Hunt for the Invisible Man

1374
02:03:03,791 --> 02:03:10,590
Kemp took some time to explain to Colonel
Adye what had happened.

1375
02:03:10,590 --> 02:03:17,119
'He's mad,' said Kemp. 'And evil. He thinks
of nothing but his own advantage, his own

1376
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:24,199
safety. I've listened this morning to a terrible
story of cruelty and pride. He has wounded

1377
02:03:24,199 --> 02:03:30,190
men. He'll kill them unless we can prevent
him. He plans to rule by terror.

1378
02:03:30,190 --> 02:03:36,250
'Nothing can stop him. He's loose outside
there now - and he's mad!'

1379
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:40,900
'He must be caught,' said Adye. 'That's certain.'

1380
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:48,060
'But how?' cried Kemp, and suddenly became
full of ideas. You must begin immediately,

1381
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:54,639
you must set every man to work; you must prevent
him leaving this place. If he gets away, he

1382
02:03:54,639 --> 02:04:00,010
may go through the country, killing as he
goes. The only thing that may keep him here

1383
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:05,719
is the thought of finding some books which
he values very much. I will tell you about

1384
02:04:05,719 --> 02:04:09,620
them. There is a man in your police station
- Marvel.'

1385
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:17,219
'I know,' said Adye, 'I know. Those books
- yes. But the Invisible Man-'

1386
02:04:17,219 --> 02:04:23,510
'Says he hasn't got them. But he thinks Marvel
has. Now listen! You must prevent him from

1387
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:29,820
eating or sleeping - day and night the country
must be on the watch for him. Food must be

1388
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:36,260
locked up, all food, so that he will have
to break into a house or shop to get it. The

1389
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:42,150
houses everywhere must be shut against him;
for 20 miles round Port Burdock, the whole

1390
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:49,500
country must begin hunting and keep on hunting.
I tell you, Adye, he's dangerous. Unless he

1391
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:53,719
is caught, it's terrible to think of the things
that may happen.'

1392
02:04:53,719 --> 02:05:01,440
'Come along,' said Colonel Adye. 'Tell me
as we go. What else is there we can do?'

1393
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:07,050
In another moment Adye was leading the way
downstairs. They found the front door open

1394
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:10,600
and the policemen standing outside staring
at empty air.

1395
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:13,469
'He's got away, sir,' said one.

1396
02:05:13,469 --> 02:05:20,619
'We must tell the police station at once,'
said Adye. 'One of you must go down and report

1397
02:05:20,619 --> 02:05:26,099
and then come up and meet us - quickly. And
now, Kemp, what else?'

1398
02:05:26,099 --> 02:05:33,570
'Dogs,' said Kemp. 'Get dogs. They don't see
him, but they smell him. Get dogs.'

1399
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:39,910
'Good,' said Adye. 'We have no suitable dogs,
but the prison officers over at Halstead know

1400
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:43,270
a man with bloodhounds. What else?'

1401
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:49,489
'Remember,' said Kemp, 'his food shows. You
can see it for some time after he has eaten

1402
02:05:49,489 --> 02:05:57,070
it, so he has to hide. You must keep on searching
in every quiet corner. And put away all weapons

1403
02:05:57,070 --> 02:06:02,719
and everything that might be a weapon. He
can't carry such things for long. You must

1404
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:06,329
hide anything he can pick up and strike men
with.'

1405
02:06:06,329 --> 02:06:10,530
'Good again,' said Adye. 'We'll find him yet!'

1406
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:13,650
'And the roads-' said Kemp, and hesitated.

1407
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:16,050
'Yes?' said Adye.

1408
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:22,199
'Broken glass,' said Kemp. 'It's cruel, I
know. But think of what he may do!'

1409
02:06:22,199 --> 02:06:25,710
Adye drew the air in between his teeth sharply.

1410
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:33,040
'It's cruel. I don't perhaps think we should.
But I'll have some broken glass ready. If

1411
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:36,090
he is killed, it will be only what he deserves.

1412
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:42,199
'The man is mad, I tell you,' said Kemp. 'He
will do anything. We must catch him by any

1413
02:06:42,199 --> 02:06:48,929
possible means. He has cut himself off from
the human race.'

1414
02:06:48,929 --> 02:06:50,730
CHAPTER TWENTY

1415
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:53,969
The Wicksteed Murder

1416
02:06:53,969 --> 02:06:59,840
The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out
of Kemp's house in blind anger. A little child

1417
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:05,369
playing near Kemp's gateway was violently
picked up and thrown to one side - so that

1418
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:12,910
his leg was broken - and then for some hours
the Invisible Man disappeared completely.

1419
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:18,500
No one knows where he went or what he did.
But we can think of him hurrying through the

1420
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:24,199
hot June morning, up the hill and onto the
open land behind Port Burdock, and hiding

1421
02:07:24,199 --> 02:07:25,889
at last in the woods.

1422
02:07:25,889 --> 02:07:32,500
There he hid for two hours, while a growing
crowd of men was hunting him across the country

1423
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:38,770
with dogs, and searching for him in every
direction. In the morning he had still been

1424
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:45,929
just a story, a terror; in the afternoon,
mainly because of Kemp's story, he was shown

1425
02:07:45,929 --> 02:07:52,230
to be a real enemy who had to be caught and
held by force, and the countryside began organising

1426
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:59,409
itself very quickly. Before two o'clock, he
might still have escaped from the area by

1427
02:07:59,409 --> 02:08:06,380
hoarding a train, but after two that became
impossible: every passenger train between

1428
02:08:06,380 --> 02:08:12,329
Southampton, Winchester, Brighton and Horsham
travelled with locked doors, and the goods

1429
02:08:12,329 --> 02:08:19,780
trains were almost entirely stopped. And in
a great circle of 20 miles round Port Burdock,

1430
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:25,900
men armed with guns and sticks were soon setting
out in groups of three and four, with dogs,

1431
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:29,830
to search the roads and fields.

1432
02:08:29,830 --> 02:08:34,800
Police on horseback followed the country roads,
stopping at every house and warning people

1433
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:40,489
to lock their doors and not to go out unless
they were armed. All the schools had closed

1434
02:08:40,489 --> 02:08:46,290
before three o'clock, and the frightened children,
keeping together in groups, hurried home.

1435
02:08:46,290 --> 02:08:53,360
A notice written by Kemp was put up everywhere,
telling people clearly what must be done - that

1436
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:59,559
the Invisible Man must have neither food nor
sleep, that a continuous watch must be kept

1437
02:08:59,559 --> 02:09:06,219
for signs of him. Before night the whole country
was on guard and also before night came news

1438
02:09:06,219 --> 02:09:11,469
of the murder of Mr Wicksteed.

1439
02:09:11,469 --> 02:09:17,849
Somewhere on the road the Invisible Man must
have picked up an iron bar. Mr Wicksteed,

1440
02:09:17,849 --> 02:09:24,179
a quiet, harmless man on his way home from
work, had, no doubt, seen an iron bar walking

1441
02:09:24,179 --> 02:09:30,620
by itself, and had turned to follow it. Perhaps
the Invisible Man imagined he was one of the

1442
02:09:30,620 --> 02:09:37,700
hunters. We only know that he stopped quiet
little Mr Wicksteed, attacked him, broke his

1443
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:43,180
arm, knocked him down and beat his head to
pieces.

1444
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:49,331
Then there is the story of a voice heard by
some men in a held, laughing and crying. Across

1445
02:09:49,331 --> 02:09:55,219
the field it went and was lost. The Invisible
Man must have seen the use Kemp had made of

1446
02:09:55,219 --> 02:10:00,889
his story. He must have found all the houses
shut and locked, and seen the groups of men

1447
02:10:00,889 --> 02:10:07,239
with dogs watching. He knew that he was a
hunted man. In the night he must have eaten

1448
02:10:07,239 --> 02:10:13,080
and slept, for on the last morning he was
himself again and ready for his struggle against

1449
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:16,460
the world.

1450
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:18,429
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE

1451
02:10:18,429 --> 02:10:23,409
The Attack on Kemp's House

1452
02:10:23,409 --> 02:10:30,590
Kemp was reading a strange letter, written
in pencil on a dirty sheet of paper.

1453
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:38,059
You have been very clever, though what you
gain by it I cannot think. You are against

1454
02:10:38,059 --> 02:10:46,290
me. For a whole day you have hunted me - you
have tried to rob me of a night's rest. But

1455
02:10:46,290 --> 02:10:55,800
I have had food, I have slept, and we are
only beginning. We are only beginning. There

1456
02:10:55,800 --> 02:11:04,280
is nothing to be done but to start the Terror.
This is the first day of the Terror. Port

1457
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:12,040
Burdock is no longer under the Queen. Tell
your police, and the rest of them; it is under

1458
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:23,170
me - the Terror! I am Invisible Man the First.
We shall begin with the death of a man named

1459
02:11:23,170 --> 02:11:32,540
Kemp. He will die today. He may hide himself
away, and collect guards around him; Death,

1460
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:41,949
the unseen Death, is coming. The game begins.
Death starts. If you help him, my people,

1461
02:11:41,949 --> 02:11:51,559
Death may fall on you too. Today Kemp is to
die.

1462
02:11:51,559 --> 02:11:59,900
Kemp read this letter twice. 'That's his voice!'
he said, 'and he means it.'

1463
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:05,699
He got up slowly, leaving his lunch unfinished
- the letter had come by the one o'clock post

1464
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:11,690
- and went into his study. He rang the bell
for his servant, and told her to go round

1465
02:12:11,690 --> 02:12:17,900
the house immediately, and see that all the
windows were shut. He closed the study windows

1466
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:25,270
himself. From a locked drawer in his bedroom
he took a little revolver, examined it carefully,

1467
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:32,040
and put it into his pocket. He wrote a number
of short notes, one to Colonel Adye, and gave

1468
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,920
them to his servant to take.

1469
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:42,540
'There is no danger to you,' he said. He thought
for a time and then returned to his meal.

1470
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:51,139
Finally he struck the table. 'We will have
him!' he said. 'He'll go too far.'

1471
02:12:51,139 --> 02:12:57,660
He went up to his room, carefully shutting
every door after him. 'It's a game,' he said,

1472
02:12:57,660 --> 02:13:03,800
'a strange game - but I shall win, Mr Griffin,'
he said.

1473
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:11,020
He stood at the window staring at the hot
hillside. 'He must get food every day. Did

1474
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:18,390
he really sleep last night? Out in the open
somewhere? I wish we could get some good cold,

1475
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:23,179
wet weather instead of the heat. He may be
watching me now.'

1476
02:13:23,179 --> 02:13:29,000
He went close to the window. Something hit
the wall above the window.

1477
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,110
'I'm getting worried,' said Kemp. But it was
five minutes before he went to the window

1478
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:39,530
again. 'It must have been a bird,' he said.

1479
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:45,059
Soon he heard the front-door bell ringing
and hurried downstairs. He unchained and unlocked

1480
02:13:45,059 --> 02:13:50,139
the door, and opened it without showing himself.
It was Adye.

1481
02:13:50,139 --> 02:13:55,949
'Your servant's been attacked, Kemp,' he said
round the door.

1482
02:13:55,949 --> 02:13:58,210
'What!' exclaimed Kemp.

1483
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:04,699
'She had that note of yours taken away from
her. He's very near. Let me in.'

1484
02:14:04,699 --> 02:14:10,190
Kemp opened the door a few inches, and Adye
came in. He stood in the hall, looking at

1485
02:14:10,190 --> 02:14:12,349
Kemp locking the door.

1486
02:14:12,349 --> 02:14:18,949
Kemp swore. 'What a fool I was!' he said.
'I might have known. Already!'

1487
02:14:18,949 --> 02:14:21,270
'What's the matter?' said Adye.

1488
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:28,909
'Look here!' said Kemp, and led the way towards
his study. He handed Adye the Invisible Man's

1489
02:14:28,909 --> 02:14:29,909
letter.

1490
02:14:29,909 --> 02:14:34,329
Adye read it, 'And you-?' said Adye.

1491
02:14:34,329 --> 02:14:40,660
The sound of a breaking window came from upstairs.
Adye saw the little revolver half out of Kemp's

1492
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:47,960
pocket. 'It's a window upstairs!' said Kemp,
and led the way up. There came a second noise

1493
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:53,199
while they were still on the staircase. When
they reached the study they found two of the

1494
02:14:53,199 --> 02:14:59,440
three windows broken, the floor covered with
broken glass, and one big stone lying on the

1495
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:06,770
writing table. The two men stopped in the
doorway. Kemp swore again, and as he did so

1496
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:11,960
the third window broke with a crack like a
gunshot, and the broken glass fell into the

1497
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:12,960
room.

1498
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:15,900
'What's this for?' said Adye.

1499
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:18,349
'It's beginning,' said Kemp.

1500
02:15:18,349 --> 02:15:21,000
'There's no way of climbing up here?'

1501
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,679
'Not even for a cat,' said Kemp.

1502
02:15:24,679 --> 02:15:30,710
Stones came flying in and then it sounded
as if someone was banging on the windows downstairs.

1503
02:15:30,710 --> 02:15:34,300
The two men stood outside the study, not knowing
what to do.

1504
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:39,889
'I know!' said Adye. 'Let me have a stick
or something, and I'll go down to the station

1505
02:15:39,889 --> 02:15:43,500
and get the man with the bloodhounds. They'll
find him.'

1506
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:46,119
Another window broke.

1507
02:15:46,119 --> 02:15:49,280
'You haven't got a revolver?' asked Adye.

1508
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:55,770
Kemp's hand went to his pocket. Then he paused.
'I haven't one - at least, none that I want

1509
02:15:55,770 --> 02:15:57,130
to part with.'

1510
02:15:57,130 --> 02:16:01,929
'I'll bring it back,' said Adye. 'You'll be
safe here.'

1511
02:16:01,929 --> 02:16:05,079
Kemp gave him the weapon.

1512
02:16:05,079 --> 02:16:08,020
'Now for the door,' said Adye.

1513
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:13,309
As they stood waiting in the hall, they heard
one of the bedroom windows crack. Kemp went

1514
02:16:13,309 --> 02:16:19,099
to the door and began to turn the key as silently
as he could. His face was a little paler than

1515
02:16:19,099 --> 02:16:20,099
usual.

1516
02:16:20,099 --> 02:16:23,780
'You must step straight out,' he said.

1517
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:29,680
In another moment Adye was on the doorstep
and the door was shut. He waited for a moment,

1518
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:35,050
feeling more comfortable with his back against
the door. Then he marched down the steps.

1519
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:40,019
He crossed the grass and had almost reached
the gate when something moved near him.

1520
02:16:40,019 --> 02:16:46,300
'Stop a bit,' said a Voice, and Adye stopped,
with his hand on the revolver.

1521
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:48,140
'Well?' said Adye.

1522
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,890
'Please go back to the house,' said the Voice.

1523
02:16:52,890 --> 02:16:57,530
'No,' said Adye. He thought of trying a shot
in the direction of the Voice.

1524
02:16:57,530 --> 02:17:00,840
'What are you going to do?' said the Voice.

1525
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:05,330
'What I do is my own business,' said Adye.

1526
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:10,389
The words were still on his lips when an arm
came round his neck, he felt a knee in his

1527
02:17:10,389 --> 02:17:16,200
back, and his head was forced backward. He
fired the gun wildly, and in another moment

1528
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:21,570
he was struck in the mouth and the weapon
was taken from his hand. He tried to struggle,

1529
02:17:21,570 --> 02:17:23,290
and was thrown on his back.

1530
02:17:23,290 --> 02:17:26,110
'You devil!' said Adye.

1531
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:33,690
The Voice laughed. 'I would kill you now if
it wasn't a waste of a shot,' it said. Adye

1532
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:38,149
saw the revolver in the air, 6 feet off, pointing
at him.

1533
02:17:38,149 --> 02:17:40,630
'Well?' said Adye, sitting up.

1534
02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:43,120
'Get up,' said the Voice.

1535
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:44,969
Adye stood up.

1536
02:17:44,969 --> 02:17:52,331
'Stand still,' said the Voice, and then firmly.
'Don't try any tricks. Remember I can see

1537
02:17:52,331 --> 02:17:57,800
your face, if you can't see mine. You've got
to go back to the house.'

1538
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:00,679
'He won't let me in,' said Adye.

1539
02:18:00,679 --> 02:18:06,179
'That's a pity,' said the Invisible Man. 'It
isn't you I want to kill.'

1540
02:18:06,179 --> 02:18:12,429
Adye glanced away from the revolver and saw
the sea far off, very blue and dark under

1541
02:18:12,429 --> 02:18:19,010
the bright sun. He saw the smooth green hill,
the white rocks of the coast, and the spreading

1542
02:18:19,010 --> 02:18:26,250
town, and suddenly he knew that life was very
sweet. His eyes came back to this little metal

1543
02:18:26,250 --> 02:18:34,960
thing hanging between heaven and earth, six
feet away. 'What must I do?' he asked.

1544
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:43,410
'What must I do?' asked the Invisible Man.
'If I let you go, you'll get help. The only

1545
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:46,899
thing is for you to go back to the house.'

1546
02:18:46,899 --> 02:18:54,269
'I'll try. If he lets me in, will you promise
not to charge the door?'

1547
02:18:54,269 --> 02:18:59,530
'I don't want to fight you,' said the Voice.

1548
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:05,099
Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye
out, and now, looking through a broken window,

1549
02:19:05,099 --> 02:19:12,679
he saw Adye stand talking with the unseen
enemy. 'Why doesn't he fire?' said Kemp to

1550
02:19:12,679 --> 02:19:15,340
himself. Then the revolver moved a little.

1551
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:20,719
'That's strange!' he said. 'Adye has given
up the revolver.'

1552
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:27,349
'Promise not to charge the door,' Adye was
saying. 'Give me a chance.'

1553
02:19:27,349 --> 02:19:32,760
'Just go back to the house. I tell you I'll
promise nothing.'

1554
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:38,729
Adye seemed to decide suddenly. He turned
towards the house, and walked slowly with

1555
02:19:38,729 --> 02:19:46,219
his hands behind him. Kemp watched him. The
revolver appeared, a small dark object, following

1556
02:19:46,219 --> 02:19:53,631
Adye. Then things happened very quickly. Adye
jumped at the small object, missed it, threw

1557
02:19:53,631 --> 02:19:59,260
up his hands and fell forward on his face.
A little ball of blue smoke rose into the

1558
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:06,880
air! Kemp did not hear the sound of the shot.
Adye raised himself on one arm, fell forward,

1559
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:10,340
and lay still.

1560
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:16,180
For a time Kemp remained looking at Adye as
he lay peacefully on the grass. The day was

1561
02:20:16,180 --> 02:20:24,510
very hot and still. Nothing seemed to move.
Adye lay on the grass near the gate. The curtains

1562
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:30,130
of all the houses down the hill road were
drawn, but in one little green garden hut

1563
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:37,160
was a white figure, rather like an old man
asleep. Kemp's eyes returned to Adye - the

1564
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:40,729
game was not beginning well!

1565
02:20:40,729 --> 02:20:45,981
Then came a ringing and a knocking at the
front door, but nobody opened it. Silence

1566
02:20:45,981 --> 02:20:52,040
followed. Kemp sat listening and then began
to look carefully out of the three windows,

1567
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:58,010
one after another. He went to the stairs and
stood listening anxiously. What was his enemy

1568
02:20:58,010 --> 02:21:00,319
doing?

1569
02:21:00,319 --> 02:21:06,050
Suddenly there was a banging from below. He
waited and went down the stairs again. The

1570
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:12,340
house was filled with the sound of heavy blows
and breaking wood. He went into the kitchen.

1571
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:15,859
The door was being broken down with an axe.

1572
02:21:15,859 --> 02:21:21,050
Kemp went back into the passage, trying to
think. In a moment the Invisible Man would

1573
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:26,439
be in the kitchen. This door would not keep
him a moment, and then the front-door bell

1574
02:21:26,439 --> 02:21:33,530
rang again and Kemp heard voices. It was the
policemen with the servant. He ran into the

1575
02:21:33,530 --> 02:21:39,979
hall, opened the door, and three people fell
into the house in a pile. Kemp shut the door

1576
02:21:39,979 --> 02:21:40,979
again.

1577
02:21:40,979 --> 02:21:47,380
'The Invisible Man!' said Kemp. 'He has a
revolver - with two shots left. He's killed

1578
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:54,240
Adye. At least, he's shot him. Didn't you
see him on the grass? He's lying there.'

1579
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:56,670
'Who?' said one of the policemen.

1580
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:58,240
'Adye,' said Kemp.

1581
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:02,080
'We came round the back way,' said the girl.

1582
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:04,990
'What's that banging?' asked one of the policemen.

1583
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:10,560
'He's in the kitchen - or will be. He's found
an axe-'

1584
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:15,710
Suddenly the house was full of the sound of
the Invisible Man's blows on the kitchen door.

1585
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:21,290
The girl stared towards the kitchen and stepped
into the dining room. Kemp tried to explain

1586
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:25,600
in broken sentences. They heard the kitchen
door breaking open.

1587
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:31,130
'This way,' cried Kemp, and he pushed the
policemen into the dining room doorway.

1588
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:35,490
'The pokers,' said Kemp, and rushed to the
fire.

1589
02:22:35,490 --> 02:22:38,370
He handed a poker to each of the policemen.

1590
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:43,620
He suddenly threw himself backwards. 'Whup!'
said one policeman, jumped to one side and

1591
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:46,100
caught the axe on his poker.

1592
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:51,380
The revolver cracked and shot a hole in a
picture. The second policeman brought his

1593
02:22:51,380 --> 02:22:55,470
poker down on the little weapon and sent it
to the floor.

1594
02:22:55,470 --> 02:23:00,380
The axe went back into the passage. They could
hear the Invisible Man breathing.

1595
02:23:00,380 --> 02:23:06,000
'Stand away, you two,' he said. 'I want that
man Kemp.'

1596
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:12,430
'We want you,' said the first policeman, taking
a quick step forward and striking with his

1597
02:23:12,430 --> 02:23:18,260
poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man must
have stepped back and fallen over a chair.

1598
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:25,140
Then, as the policeman went after him, the
Invisible Man returned and struck him down.

1599
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:30,050
But the second policeman, aiming behind the
axe with his poker, hit something soft that

1600
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:36,700
cracked. There was a sharp cry of pain, and
then the axe fell to the ground. The policeman

1601
02:23:36,700 --> 02:23:43,990
struck again at emptiness and hit nothing;
he put his foot on the axe and struck again.

1602
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:49,540
Then he stood, holding the poker, listening
for the slightest movement.

1603
02:23:49,540 --> 02:23:55,720
He heard a window open, and a quick rush of
feet outside. His companion rolled over and

1604
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:59,859
sat up, with blood running down between his
eye and ear.

1605
02:23:59,859 --> 02:24:02,790
'Where is he?' asked the man on the floor.

1606
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:08,500
'I don't know. I've hit him. He's standing
somewhere in the hall unless he's slipped

1607
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:11,010
past you. Dr Kemp - sir!'

1608
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:14,390
'Dr Kemp,' cried the policeman again.

1609
02:24:14,390 --> 02:24:20,061
The second policeman began struggling to his
feet. He stood up. Suddenly the faint sound

1610
02:24:20,061 --> 02:24:26,010
of bare feet could be heard. 'Whup!' cried
the first policeman, and threw his poker.

1611
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:31,140
He started to go after the Invisible Man.
Then he changed his mind and stepped into

1612
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:32,390
the dining room.

1613
02:24:32,390 --> 02:24:35,390
'Dr Kemp-' he began.

1614
02:24:35,390 --> 02:24:43,810
The dining-room window was wide open, and
neither servant nor Kemp was to be seen.

1615
02:24:43,810 --> 02:24:46,010
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

1616
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:49,930
The Hunter Hunted

1617
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:55,760
Kemp had set off running, running to save
his life as he had seen Mr Marvel run down

1618
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:01,710
the hill road. Never, he thought, had he seemed
to run so slowly.

1619
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:05,830
People looked at him. They saw fear in his
face.

1620
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:11,890
Now he was rushing to the town below, where
people were standing or walking in groups.

1621
02:25:11,890 --> 02:25:15,880
He slowed down and then heard rapid footsteps
behind.

1622
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:22,190
'The Invisible Man,' he cried. He thought
of going into the police station, but changed

1623
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:28,931
his mind, turned down a side street and then
into a yard, into a little house and so back

1624
02:25:28,931 --> 02:25:30,690
into the main road.

1625
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:36,760
A crowd had collected in the street; there
was a noise of running feet. A big man, a

1626
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:42,670
few yards away, was swinging a heavy spade,
striking at something. Another man came out

1627
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:50,220
of a shop with a thick stick in his hand.
'Spread out! Spread out!' cried someone. Kemp

1628
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:58,680
stopped and looked round, breathing heavily.
'He's close!' he cried. 'Form a line across-'

1629
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:04,400
He was hit hard under the ear and tried to
turn round towards his unseen enemy. Then

1630
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:10,550
he was hit again under the jaw, and fell to
the ground. In another moment a knee was digging

1631
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:16,850
into his chest and hands held his throat,
but one hand was weaker than the other; then

1632
02:26:16,850 --> 02:26:22,500
the spade of the big man came through the
air above him, and struck something. He felt

1633
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:28,729
warm blood on his face. The hold on his throat
was loosened and Kemp rolled on top of his

1634
02:26:28,729 --> 02:26:29,729
enemy.

1635
02:26:29,729 --> 02:26:38,500
'I've got him!' cried Kemp. 'Help! Help - hold
him! He's down! Hold his feet!'

1636
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:43,340
In another second there was a rush of people
to the struggle. There was no shouting after

1637
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:48,990
Kemp's cry - only a sound of blows and feet
and heavy breathing.

1638
02:26:48,990 --> 02:26:55,630
Then the Invisible Man got to his feet. Kemp
still held his legs. Then someone got hold

1639
02:26:55,630 --> 02:27:02,420
of his neck and pulled him back. Down went
the pile of struggling, kicking men again.

1640
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:06,870
Then suddenly came a wild cry that died away
into silence.

1641
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:13,500
'Get back!' cried Kemp. 'He's hurt, I tell
you. Stand back.'

1642
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:16,600
A doctor was feeling the unseen body.

1643
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,930
'The mouth is all wet,' he said.

1644
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:26,740
He stood up quickly, and then knelt down on
the ground by the side of the unseen thing.

1645
02:27:26,740 --> 02:27:32,000
More people joined the pushing crowd. Men
were coming out of the houses. The doors of

1646
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:40,100
the inn stood wide open. Very little was said.
Kemp felt around him; his hands seemed to

1647
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:48,900
pass through empty air. 'He's not breathing,'
he said, and then, 'I cannot feel his heart.

1648
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:51,500
His side - ugh!'

1649
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:57,480
An old woman, looking under the arm of the
big man with the spade, cried out. 'Look there!'

1650
02:27:57,480 --> 02:28:05,470
she said, and pointed. And looking where she
pointed, everyone saw a shadowy, cloudy body.

1651
02:28:05,470 --> 02:28:11,300
At first, they could see through it, but it
was becoming more solid every moment.

1652
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:17,010
'Hello!' cried the policeman. 'Here are his
feet showing!'

1653
02:28:17,010 --> 02:28:22,600
And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and
feet, and spreading slowly to the centre of

1654
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:29,670
his body, that strange change continued. It
was like the slow movement of a poison. They

1655
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:36,210
saw the glassy bones, then the flesh and skin,
misty at first but slowly growing thicker

1656
02:28:36,210 --> 02:28:42,010
and harder and more solid. Soon they could
see his chest and his shoulders, and the faint

1657
02:28:42,010 --> 02:28:45,319
shape of his face.

1658
02:28:45,319 --> 02:28:50,970
When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to
stand back, there lay the bare and broken

1659
02:28:50,970 --> 02:28:58,439
body of a young man of about thirty. His hair
was white - not grey with age, but white as

1660
02:28:58,439 --> 02:29:08,180
snow - and his eyes were bright like jewels.
His expression was one of anger and fear.

1661
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:14,200
'Cover his face!' cried a man. 'In God's name,
cover that face!'

1662
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:19,680
Someone brought a sheet. They covered him,
and carried him into the inn. And there it

1663
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:27,680
was, on a bed in an ill-lighted bedroom, among
a crowd of excited people, that Griffin, the

1664
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,549
first of all men to make himself invisible,
ended his strange and terrible life.
