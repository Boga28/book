CHAPTER ONE
Thunder Road - Bruce Spingsteen

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,980
I can remember listening to this song and
loving it in 1975; I can remember listening

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,450
to this song and loving it almost as much
quite recently, a few months ago.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,140
(And, yes, I was in a car, although I probably
wasn't driving, and I certainly wasn't driving

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,599
down any turnpike or highway or freeway, and
the wind wasn't blowing through my hair, because

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,619
I possess neither a convertible nor hair.

7
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,999
It's not that version of Springsteen.)

8
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:37,570
So I've loved this song for a quarter of a
century now, and I've heard it more than anything

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,820
else, with the possible exception of...

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,590
Who am I kidding?

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,239
There are no other contenders.

12
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,570
See, what I was going to do there was soften
the blow, slip in something black and... or

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,989
cool possibly 'Let's Get It On', which I think
is the best pop record ever made, and which

14
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,020
would easily make it into my top 20 most-played
songs list, but not at number 2.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,570
Number 2 - and I'm trying to be honest here
- would probably be something like '(White

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,280
Man) In Hammersmith Palais' by The Clash,
but it would be way, way behind.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,270
Let's say I've played 'Thunder Road' 1,500
times (just over once a week for twenty-five

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,799
years, which sounds about right, if one takes
into account the repeat plays in the first

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,330
couple of years); '(White Man)... would have
clocked up something like 500 plays.

20
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,530
In other words, there's no real competition.

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,450
It's weird to me how 'Thunder Road' has survived
when so many other, arguably better songs

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,799
- 'Maggie May', 'Hey Jude', 'God Save The
Queen', 'Stir It Up', 'So Tired of Being Alone',

23
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,479
'You're A Big Girl Now' - have become less
compelling as I've got older.

24
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:53,520
It's not as if I can't see the flaws: 'Thunder
Road' is overwrought, both lyrically (as Prefab

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,850
Sprout pointed out, there's more to life than
cars and girls, and surely the word 'redemption'

26
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,189
is to be avoided like the plague when you're
writing songs about redemption) and musically

27
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,500
- after all, this four and three-quarter minutes
provided Jim Steinman and Meatloaf with a

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,960
whole career.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,250
It's also po-faced, in a way that Springsteen
himself isn't, and if the doomed romanticism

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,670
wasn't corny in 1975, then it certainly is
now.

31
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,040
But sometimes, very occasionally, songs and
books and films and pictures express who you

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,020
are, perfectly.

33
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,530
And they don't do this in words or images,
necessarily; the connection is a lot less

34
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,920
direct and more complicated than that.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,150
When I was first beginning to write seriously,
I read Anne Tyler's Dinner at the Homesick

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,510
Restaurant, and suddenly knew what I was,
and what I wanted to be, for better or for

37
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,510
worse.

38
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,800
It's a process something like falling in love.

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,471
You don't necessarily choose the best person,
or the wisest, or the most beautiful; there's

40
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,630
something else going on.

41
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,150
There was a part of me that would rather have
fallen for Updike, or Kerouac, or DeLillo

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,430
- for someone masculine, at least, maybe somebody
a little more opaque, and certainly someone

43
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,780
who uses more swear-words - and, though I
have admired those writers, at various stages

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,890
in my life, admiration is a very different
thing from the kind of transference I'm talking

45
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,010
about.

46
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm talking about understanding - or at least
feeling like I understand - every artistic

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,940
decision, every impulse, the soul of both
the work and its creator.

48
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,500
'This is me,' I wanted to say when I read
Tyler's rich, sad, lovely novel.

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,950
'I'm not a character, I'm nothing like the
author, I haven't had the experiences she

50
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,050
writes about.

51
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,950
But even so, this is what I feel like, inside.

52
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,740
This is what I would sound like, if ever I
were to find a voice.'

53
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,450
And I did find a voice, eventually, and it
was mine, not hers; but nevertheless, so powerful

54
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,350
was the process of identification that I still
don't feel as though I've expressed myself

55
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,340
as well, as completely, as Tyler did on my
behalf then.

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,729
So, even though I'm not American, no longer
young, hate cars, and can recognize why so

57
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,930
many people find Springsteen bombastic and
histrionic (but not why they find him macho

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,590
or jingoistic or dumb - that kind of ignorant
judgment has plagued Springsteen for a huge

59
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,410
part of his career, and is made by smart people
who are actually a lot dumber than he has

60
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,500
ever been), 'Thunder Road' somehow manages
to speak for me.

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,699
This is partly - and perhaps shamingly - because
a lot of Springsteen's songs from this period

62
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,540
are about becoming famous, or at least achieving
some kind of public validation through his

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,099
art: what else are we supposed to think when
the last line of the song is 'I'm pulling

64
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:01,800
out of here to win', other than that he has
won, simply by virtue of playing the song,

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,100
night after night after night, to an ever-increasing
crowd of people?

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,169
(And what else are we supposed to think when
in 'Rosalita' he sings, with a touching, funny

67
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:17,259
and innocent glee, 'Cos the record company,
Rosie, just gave me a big advance', other

68
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,500
than that the record company has just given
him a big advance?)

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,620
It's never objectionable or obnoxious, this
dream of fame, because it derives from a restless

70
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,009
and uncontrollable artistic urge - he knows
he has talent to burn, and the proper reward

71
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:39,449
for this, he seems to suggest, would be the
financial wherewithal to fulfil it - rather

72
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,380
than an interest in celebrity for its own
sake.

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,909
Hosting a TV quiz show, or assassinating a
president, wouldn't scratch the itch at all.

74
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,419
And, of course - don't let anyone tell you
otherwise - if you have dreams of becoming

75
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,810
a writer, then there are murky, mucky visions
of fame attached to these dreams too; 'Thunder

76
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,289
Road' was my answer to every rejection letter
I received, and every doubt expressed by friends

77
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,430
or relatives.

78
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,840
They lived in towns for losers, I told myself,
and I, like Bruce, was pulling out of there

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
to win.

80
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,490
(These towns, incidentally, were Cambridge
- full of loser doctors and lawyers and academics

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,560
- and London - full of loser successes of
every description - but never mind.

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,499
This was the material I had to work with,
and work with it I did.)

83
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:33,099
It helped a great deal that, as time went
by, and there was no sign of me pulling out

84
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,590
of anywhere to do anything very much, and
certainly not with the speed implied in the

85
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,889
song, 'Thunder Road' made reference to age,
thus accommodating this lack of forward momentum.

86
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,849
'So you're scared and you're thinking that
maybe we ain't that young any more', Bruce

87
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,449
sang, and that line worked for me even when
I had begun to doubt whether there was any

88
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:59,979
magic in the night: I continued thinking I
wasn't that young any more for a long, long

89
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,919
time - decades, in fact - and even today I
choose to interpret it as a wistful observation

90
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,550
of middle age, rather than the sharp fear
that comes on in late youth.

91
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,259
It also helped that, sometime in the early
to mid-eighties, I came across another version

92
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,300
of the song, a bootleg studio recording of
Springsteen alone with an acoustic guitar

93
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,559
(it's on War And Roses, the Born To Run outtakes
bootleg); he reimagines 'Thunder Road' as

94
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:36,189
a haunting, exhausted hymn to the past, to
lost love and missed opportunities and self-delusion

95
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,520
and bad luck and failure, and that worked
pretty well for me, too.

96
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,400
In fact, when I try to hear that last line
of the song in my head, it's the acoustic

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,229
version that comes first.

98
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:55,360
It's slow, and mournful, and utterly convincing:
an artist who can persuade you of the truth

99
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,749
of what he is singing with either version
is an artist who is capable of an awful lot.

100
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,319
There are other bootleg versions that I play
and love.

101
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,199
One of the great things about the song as
it appears on Born To Run is that those first

102
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,509
few bars, on wheezy harmonica and achingly
pretty piano, actually sound like they refer

103
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:21,830
to something that has already happened before
the beginning of the record, something momentous

104
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,360
and sad but not destructive of all hope; as
Thunder Road' is the first track on side one

105
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,310
of Born To Run, the album begins, in effect,
with its own closing credits.

106
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,970
In performance at the end of the seventies,
during the Darkness on the Edge of Town tour,

107
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,370
Springsteen maximized this effect by seguing
into 'Thunder Road' out of one of his bleakest,

108
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,750
most desperate songs, 'Racing In The Street',
and the harmonica that marks the transformation

109
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,230
of one song into the other feels like a sudden
and glorious hint of spring after a long,

110
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,780
withering winter.

111
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,430
On the bootlegs of those seventies shows,
Thunder Road' can finally provide the salvation

112
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,270
that its position on Born To Run denied it.

113
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,880
Maybe the reason Thunder Road' has sustained
for me is that, despite its energy and volume

114
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,270
and fast cars and hair, it somehow manages
to sound elegiac, and the older I get the

115
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,050
more I can hear that.

116
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,180
When it comes down to it, I suppose that I
too believe that life is momentous and sad

117
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,520
but not destructive of all hope, and maybe
that makes me a self-dramatizing depressive,

118
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,010
or maybe it makes me a happy idiot, but either
way 'Thunder Road' knows how I feel and who

119
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,450
I am, and that, in the end, is one of the
consolations of art.

120
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,010
Postscript

121
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,350
A few years ago, I started to sell a lot of
books, at first only in the UK, and then later

122
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,840
in other countries too, and to my intense
bewilderment found that I had somehow become

123
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,140
part of the literary and cultural mainstream.

124
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,820
It wasn't something I had expected, or was
prepared for.

125
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,770
Although I could see no reason why anyone
would feel excluded from my work - it wasn't

126
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,090
like it was difficult, or experimental - my
books still seemed to me to be quirky and

127
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,940
small- scale.

128
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,040
But suddenly all sorts of people, people I
didn't know or like or respect, had opinions

129
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,940
about me and my work, which overnight seemed
to go from being fresh and original to cliched

130
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,400
and ubiquitous, without a word of it having
changed.

131
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,840
And I was shown this horrible reflection of
myself and what I did, a funfair hall-of-mirrors

132
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,050
reflection, all squished-up and distorted
- me, but not me.

133
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,671
It wasn't like I was given a particularly
hard time, and certainly other people, some

134
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,680
of whom I know, have experienced much worse.

135
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,910
But even so, it becomes in those circumstances
very hard to hang on to the idea of what you

136
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,860
want to do.

137
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,510
And yet Springsteen somehow managed to find
a way through.

138
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,800
His name is still taken in vain frequently
(a year or so ago I read a newspaper piece

139
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,550
attacking Tony Blair for his love of Bruce,
an indication, apparently, of the Prime Minister's

140
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,940
incorrigible philistinism), and for some,
the hall-of-mirrors reflection is the only

141
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,980
Springsteen they can see.

142
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:32,000
He went from being rock 'n' roll future to
a lumpy, flag-waving, stadium-rocking meathead

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,860
in the space of a few months, again with nothing
much having changed, beyond the level of his

144
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,100
popularity.

145
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,510
Anyway, his strength of purpose, and the way
he has survived the assault on his sense of

146
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,750
self, seem to me exemplary; sometimes it's
hard to remember that a lot of people liking

147
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,220
what you do doesn't necessarily mean that
what you do is of no value whatsoever.

148
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,380
Indeed, sometimes it might even suggest the
opposite.

149
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,491
CHAPTER TWO
I'm Like a Bird - Nelly Furtado

150
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:12,360
Oh, of course I can understand people dismissing
pop music.

151
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,260
I know that a lot of it, nearly all of it,
is trashy, unimaginative, poorly written,

152
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,230
slickly produced, inane, repetitive and juvenile
(although at least four of these adjectives

153
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,440
could be used to describe the incessant attacks
on pop that you can still find in posh magazines

154
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,220
and newspapers); I know too, believe me, that
Cole Porter was 'better' than Madonna or Travis,

155
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,790
that most pop songs are aimed cynically at
a target audience three decades younger than

156
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,080
I am, that in any case the golden age was
thirty-five years ago and there has been very

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,170
little of value since.

158
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,370
It's just that there's this song I heard on
the radio, and I bought the CD, and now I

159
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,030
have to hear it ten or fifteen times a day...

160
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,720
That's the thing that puzzles me about those
who feel that contemporary pop (and I use

161
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,440
the word to encompass soul, reggae, country,
rock - anything and everything that might

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,950
be regarded as trashy) is beneath them, or
behind them, or beyond them - some preposition

163
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,310
denoting distance, anyway: does this mean
that you never hear, or at least never enjoy,

164
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:25,190
new songs, that everything you whistle or
hum was written years, decades, centuries

165
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,190
ago?

166
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:31,550
Do you really deny yourselves the pleasure
of mastering a tune (a pleasure, incidentally,

167
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,660
that your generation is perhaps the first
in the history of mankind to forgo) because

168
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,160
you are afraid it might make you look as if
you don't know who Harold Bloom is?

169
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,320
Wow, I'll bet you're fun at parties.

170
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,990
The song that has been driving me pleasurably
potty recently is 'I'm Like a Bird' by Nelly

171
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,990
Furtado.

172
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,330
Only history will judge whether Ms Furtado
turns out to be any kind of artist, and though

173
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,830
I have my suspicions that she will not change
the way we look at the world, I can't say

174
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,700
that I'm very bothered: I will always be grateful
to her for creating in me the narcotic need

175
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,330
to hear her song again and again.

176
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,660
It is, after all, a harmless need, easily
satisfied, and there are few enough of those

177
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,780
in the world.

178
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,320
I don't even want to make a case for this
song, as opposed to any other - although I

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,450
happen to think that it's a very good pop
song, with a dreamy languor and a bruised

180
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,010
optimism that immediately distinguishes it
from its anemic and stunted peers.

181
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,190
The point is that a few months ago it didn't
exist, at least as far as we are concerned,

182
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,470
and now here it is, and that, in itself, is
a small miracle.

183
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,660
Dave Eggers has a theory that we play songs
over and over, those of us who do, because

184
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,140
we have to 'solve' them, and it's true that
in our early relationship with, and courtship

185
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,350
of, a new song, there is a stage which is
akin to a sort of emotional puzzlement.

186
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,701
There's a little bit in 'I'm Like a Bird',
for example, about halfway through, where

187
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:08,160
the voice is double-tracked on a phrase, and
the effect - especially on someone who is

188
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,510
not a musician, someone who loves and appreciates
music but is baffled and seduced by even the

189
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,740
simplest musical tricks - is rich and fresh
and addictive.

190
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,880
Sure, it will seem thin and stale soon enough.

191
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,050
Before very long I will have 'solved' 'I'm
Like a Bird', and I won't want to hear it

192
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,780
very much anymore - a three-minute pop song
can only withhold its mysteries for so long,

193
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
after all.

194
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,130
So, yes, it's disposable, as if that makes
any difference to anyone's perceptions of

195
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,720
the value of pop music.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,800
But then, shouldn't we be sick of 'Moonlight'
Sonata by now?

197
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,180
Or Christina's World?

198
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,430
Or The Importance of Being Earnest?

199
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,510
They're empty!

200
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,540
Nothing left!

201
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,110
We sucked 'em dry!

202
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,910
That's what gets me: the very people who are
snotty about the disposability of pop will

203
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,720
go over and over again to see Lady Bracknell
say 'A handbag?'

204
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,170
in a funny voice.

205
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,370
They don't think that joke's exhausted itself?

206
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:11,340
Maybe disposability is a sign of pop music's
maturity, a recognition of its own limitations,

207
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,140
rather than the converse.

208
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,300
And anyway, I was sitting in a doctor's waiting-room
the other day, and four little Afro- Caribbean

209
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,170
girls, patiently sitting out their mother's
appointment, suddenly launched into Nelly

210
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,300
Furtado's song.

211
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,250
They were word perfect, and they had a couple
of dance moves, and they sang with enormous

212
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:35,010
appetite and glee, and I liked it that we
had something in common, temporarily; I felt

213
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,600
as though we all lived in the same world,
and that doesn't happen so often.

214
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,650
A couple of times a year I make myself a tape
to play in the car, a tape full of all the

215
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,360
new songs I've loved over the previous few
months, and every time I finish one I can't

216
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,820
believe that there'll be another.

217
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,280
Yet there always is, and I can't wait for
the next one; you need only a few hundred

218
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,160
more things like that, and you've got a life
worth living.

219
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,800
CHAPTER THREE
Samba Pa Ti - Santana

220
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:13,499
'Samba Pa Ti' is an instrumental, rather than
a song, but for a crucial period in my mid-teens,

221
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:18,949
when I first came across it, it spoke to me
as eloquently as anything that contained lyrics:

222
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,899
I was convinced that it described sex.

223
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:26,299
More specifically, 'Samba Pa Ti' was what
I was going to hear when I lost my virginity

224
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,860
- if not on the stereo, then in my head.

225
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,970
It starts off slow and mysterious and beautiful,
and then it gets more urgent, and then - well,

226
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,580
then it fades out.

227
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,130
(The track lasts four minutes and forty-seven
seconds, incidentally; but before I am accused

228
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,200
of showing off, I had anticipated that we'd
be doing other things - kissing, getting undressed,

229
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,669
possibly waiting for a bus home from the cinema
- during the slow bit, so I was confident

230
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,909
that I could make it through to the fade.)

231
00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:00,720
I hadn't, at that time, heard anything that
would serve as a better soundtrack; indeed,

232
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,210
I'm not entirely sure that I've heard anything
to beat it since.

233
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,730
All sorts of pieces of music are constantly
being described as 'sexy', but that doesn't

234
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,539
necessarily mean that you'd want them to accompany
love-making.

235
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,429
Most of them, in fact, are sexual substitutes,
rather than sexual accompaniments - music

236
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,710
for people who aren't getting any (or won't
be until they get home) rather than people

237
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,929
who are.

238
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,020
Would it be possible to fuck to the tune of
'Let's Get It On' without laughing?

239
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,929
(Not that there's anything wrong with laughing
during sex, but laughter was not, I suspect,

240
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,450
the sound that Marvin intended to provoke.

241
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,360
If you want to laugh, then why not enhance
your amorous pleasure with 'I Have a Pony',

242
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
by Steven Wright, or 'Disco Duck', by Rick
Dees?)

243
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,250
And even if you did manage to get through
it without a giggling fit, could you man-age

244
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,490
the same during 'If I Should Die Tonight',
the third track on the album?

245
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,130
Granted, you may have finished by then, but
there's every chance that you won't have turned

246
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,179
the music off, which means that you'll be
lying there with your girlfriend, or boyfriend,

247
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,740
or someone you don't know very well, while
Marvin is telling you that the sex you have

248
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,129
just had is unlikely to be bettered during
the remainder of your lifetimes - indeed,

249
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:16,539
that you may as well shuffle off this mortal
coil now, so anticlimactic is any subsequent

250
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,860
experience likely to be.

251
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,840
This is an intolerable burden to place on
any couple, and certainly inhibits the usual

252
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,970
post-coital activities (sleep, the hunt for
socks or the TV remote, exchanges of false

253
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,360
email addresses, etc.).

254
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,909
Prince's 'Do Me, Baby', from the Controversy
album, is one of the most sexually explicit,

255
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:43,419
and genuinely erotic, records ever made, but
it's every bit as problematic as 'Let's Get

256
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:44,570
It On'.

257
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:50,190
For a start, there's a bit after the climax
(crashing piano chords, moans, sighs, and

258
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,520
so on) when he goes all weird, and starts
saying he's 'soooo cold', which might well

259
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,110
prove to be something of a distraction unless
you too have an inappropriately under togged

260
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,790
duvet.

261
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,830
And though the next song on the album, 'Private
Joy', is hardly what you want to hear at an

262
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,710
intimate moment, at least it brings the first
side of Controversy to a close if you have

263
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,520
the album on vinyl; if you have the CD, however,
you may find yourself in the unhappy position

264
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,740
of trying to give and receive carnal pleasure
while Prince sings 'Ronnie Talk To Russia'

265
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,289
- a sentiment that no longer even contains
the virtue, arguable in a sexual context anyway,

266
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,289
of urgency.

267
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,120
What, one wonders, was he thinking of when
he sequenced the tracks?

268
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
Presumably something along the lines of, 'Give
them five minutes to get their breath back,

269
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,190
and then they'll be wanting to think about
impending Armageddon.'

270
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,879
Inevitably, I did not lose my virginity to
'Samba Pa Ti'.

271
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:51,700
Instead, my unfortunate girlfriend and I were
listening to the second side of Rod Stewart's

272
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Smiler, my favourite record at the time; side
two, I notice now, features 'Hard Road', 'I've

273
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,850
Grown Accustomed To Her Face' and 'Dixie Toot'.

274
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:10,360
In a perfect world, obviously, that wouldn't
have happened.

275
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,279
CAN YOU PLEASE CRAWL OUT YOUR WINDOW?

276
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,279
BOB DYLAN

277
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,700
CHAPTER FOUR
Rain - The Beatles

278
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,130
By expressing no preference between a Rod
Stewart version of a Bob Dylan song and the

279
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,919
Dylan original, I have, I know, exposed myself:
I'm not a big Dylan fan.

280
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,299
I've got Blonde On Blonde and Highway 61 Revisited,
obviously.

281
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,860
And Bringing It All Back Home and Blood On
the Tracks.

282
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,299
Anyone who likes music owns those four.

283
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,679
And I'm interested enough to have bought The
Bootleg Series Volumes 7-3, and that live

284
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,510
album we now know wasn't recorded at the Royal
Albert Hall.

285
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,740
The reviews of Time Out Of Mind and Love And
Theft convinced me to shell out for these

286
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,460
two, as well, although I can't say I listen
to them very often.

287
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,240
I once asked for Biograph as a birthday present,
so with that and The Bootleg Series I've got

288
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,049
two Dylan boxed sets.

289
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:10,600
I also, now I look, seem to own copies of
World Gone Wrong, The Basement Tapes and Good

290
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,549
As I Been To You, although this, I suspect,
is due more to my respect for Greil Marcus,

291
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,850
who has written so persuasively and brilliantly
about Dylan's folk and blues roots, than to

292
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,890
my Dylanphilia.

293
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:29,929
And I have somehow picked up along the way
Street Legal, Desire, and John Wesley Harding.

294
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,759
Oh, and I bought Oh Mercy because it contains
the lovely 'Most of the Time', which is on

295
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,840
the High Fidelity soundtrack.

296
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,420
There are, therefore, around twenty separate
Bob Dylan CDs on my shelf; in fact I own more

297
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,540
recordings by Dylan than by any other artist.

298
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,759
Some people - my mother, say, who may not
own twenty CDs in total - would say that I

299
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,929
am a Dylan fanatic, but I know Dylan fanatics,
and they would not recognize me as one of

300
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:57,929
them.

301
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:02,809
(I have a friend who stays logged on to the
Dylan website Expecting Rain most of the day

302
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,690
at work - as if the website were CNN and Dylan's
career were the Middle East - and who owns

303
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,830
130 Dylan albums, including a fourteen-CD
box of every single thing Dylan recorded during

304
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:21,220
1965 apart from - get this - Highway 67 Revisited,
the only thing he recorded during 1965 that

305
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,309
sane people would want to own.

306
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,639
He's pretty keen.)

307
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,299
I can't quote whole songs - just the odd line
here and there.

308
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:34,440
I do not regard Dylan as any more important,
or any more talented, than Elvis Presley,

309
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,999
or Marvin Gaye, or Bob Marley, or several
other major artists.

310
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,789
I have no opinion as to whether he was a poet,
and especially not as to whether he was a

311
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,980
better poet than another poet, I don't own
any bootlegs, I have no desire to see him

312
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,320
play live again (I saw him twice, and that
was more than enough), I have no theories

313
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,090
about any single song...

314
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,340
I just like some of the tunes, and that, I
have been led to believe, is Not Good Enough.

315
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,070
There is a very clever English artist called
Emma Kay who has done a series of artworks

316
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,130
which consist entirely of her (verbal) memories
of Shakespeare plays.

317
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,360
If I were to do the same for the life of Bob
Dylan, it would consist of the following list:

318
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Zimmerman

319
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,369
Hibbing, Minnesota

320
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,080
New York coffee houses

321
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,659
Joan Baez (But what about her?

322
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,250
I'm not sure.)

323
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,980
The Band, formerly The Hawks.

324
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,200
Electricity.

325
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,419
'Judas!'

326
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:33,749
Motorbike crash.

327
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:34,749
Never as good afterwards.

328
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:36,009
(Is that true?

329
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:40,580
I fear I may be getting the crash confused
with Elvis's spell in the army.)

330
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,779
Sara (Sara who?

331
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,249
Don't know).

332
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,249
Divorce.

333
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:49,499
Eye-liner Christianity Farm Aid Lots of tours

334
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:53,269
This, it seems to me, is way too much knowledge.

335
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:56,760
(Why on earth am I able to name his home town?

336
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,909
And why should I recall that he fell off his
bloody motorbike?)

337
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:04,539
I will not attempt a similar list pertaining
to the life of William Shakespeare, because

338
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:10,559
it would be far too shaming, but suffice to
say that it would not extend much beyond Stratford-upon-Avon,

339
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,860
Anne Hathaway and her cottage, the Globe and
the Dark Lady.

340
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,529
Jane Austen: Bath; unmarried; once went to
my sister's house, apparently, although some

341
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,830
time before my sister moved there.

342
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,039
(That must be right, mustn't it, dates-wise?)

343
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,850
Obviously I have no one but myself to blame
for my ignorance of our major literary figures.

344
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,690
I'm not responsible for my intimacy with the
Life of Bob, however.

345
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,659
That's the fault of all sorts of other people:
friends, music writers, university professors,

346
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,070
editors at my publishing house.

347
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,840
He's hard to avoid - mostly because his status
as a major poet allows one to like him without

348
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,869
inducing the feelings of intellectual insecurity
that usually accompany devotion to a pop star.

349
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,749
I suppose I re-sent that.

350
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:08,009
In my book, you're either in or you're out,
and if you're in, then get in properly, and

351
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:12,360
find as big a place in your heart for the
stupid stuff - 'Mmmm Bop' and 'Judy Is a Punk'

352
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,230
- as for the stuff that you can pass off as
poetry.

353
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,340
Obviously I wouldn't ask you to find as big
a place in your head for 'Mmmm Bop', but then,

354
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,840
that's partly the trouble: the best music
connects to the soul, not the brain, and I

355
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,570
worry that all this Dylan-devotion is somehow
anti-music - that it tells us the heart doesn't

356
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,250
count, and only the head matters.

357
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,309
Elsewhere in this book you will find fanciful
comparisons be-tween literature and music,

358
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,869
specifically novels and songs, but you sure
can exhaust a great song much more quickly

359
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:48,970
than you can clean out a great novel, and
- partly, I suspect, because I am not interested

360
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,299
in Dylan as poet - I've exhausted Bob, or
at least the bits of Bob that I'm interested

361
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,299
in.

362
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:00,309
I wish I hadn't; there's a density and a gravity
to a Dylan song that you can't find anywhere

363
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:01,309
else.

364
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:07,379
But even more than I regret mining the seam
for all it's worth (or all it's worth to me),

365
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:12,879
I regret never having heard any of the songs
at the right age, in the right year.

366
00:27:12,879 --> 00:27:17,019
What must it have been like, to listen to
'Like A Rolling Stone' in 1966, aged nineteen

367
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:19,940
or twenty?

368
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:27,179
I heard 'White Riot' and 'Anarchy In The UK'
in 1976, aged nineteen, but the enormous power

369
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,320
those records had then has mostly been lost
now.

370
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,359
Much of the shock came from their volume and
speed and brevity, and records consequently

371
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:42,169
became louder and faster and shorter; listening
to them a quarter of a century later is like

372
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:44,639
watching old film of Jesse Owens running.

373
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:50,330
You can see that he won his races, but all
sense of pace has been wiped away by Maurice

374
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,380
Greene.

375
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,649
'Like A Rolling Stone', however, still sounds
perfect.

376
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:57,450
It just doesn't sound fresh anymore.

377
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:03,109
In Victorian London they used to burn phosphorus
at seances in an attempt to see ghosts, and

378
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:08,179
I suspect that the pop-music equivalent is
our obsession with B-sides and alternative

379
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,059
versions and unreleased material.

380
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:15,950
If you can hear Dylan and The Beatles being
unmistakably themselves at their peak - but

381
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,690
unmistakably themselves in a way we haven't
heard a thousand, a million times before - then

382
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,519
suddenly you get a small but thrilling flash
of their spirit, and it's as close as we'll

383
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,259
ever get, those of us born in the wrong time,
to knowing what it must have been like to

384
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,200
have those great records burst out of the
radio at you when you weren't expecting them,

385
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,559
or anything like them.

386
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,039
'Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?' is,
I accept, a minor Dylan track, one of his

387
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,259
snarly (and less than poetic) put-downs, but
it is from my favourite period (electric,

388
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,150
with that crisp, clean organ sound), and I
haven't heard it a million times before, so

389
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,720
it sneaks its way on to car tapes now.

390
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,639
And 'Rain' is a great Beatles song from a
great year in their career, the year that

391
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,710
Oasis have been trying to live in for the
last ten years, and it's wonderful to listen

392
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,600
to a Lennon/McCartney song that hasn't quite
had all the pulp sucked from it.

393
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,090
I'll get sick of both these songs in the end,
of course - they just don't last long enough

394
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,279
to keep their mystery and magic forever.

395
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,539
But they'll do for now.

396
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:27,480
CHAPTER FIVE
A Minor Incident - Badly Drawn Boy

397
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,720
'You must be excited about the film coming
out,' a friendly and well-meaning acquaintance

398
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,429
remarked at the end of 2001, a few months
before the movie version of About A Boy was

399
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,429
released.

400
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:40,149
(Those weren't her actual words.

401
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:44,270
Her actual words were, 'You must be excited
about About A Boy coming out.'

402
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:50,200
I changed them because, prose stylist that
I am, I wanted to avoid that double 'about'.

403
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,230
I'm sick of it.

404
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,750
My advice to young writers: never begin a
title with a preposition, because you will

405
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,580
find that it is impossible to utter or to
write any sentence pertaining to your creation

406
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,470
without sounding as if you have an especially
pitiable stutter.

407
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,629
'He wanted to talk to me about About A Boy.'

408
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:08,489
'What about About A Boy?'

409
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,129
The thing about About A Boy...'

410
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:12,370
'Are you excited about About A Boy?'

411
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,659
And so on.

412
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:16,269
I wonder if Steinbeck and his publishers got
sick of it?

413
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:19,049
'What do you think of Of Mice and Men?'

414
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,809
'I've just finished the first half of Of Mice
and Men.'

415
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:24,739
'What's the publication date of Of Mice and
Men?'...

416
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,659
Still, it seemed like a good idea at the time.)

417
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,129
I smiled politely, but the supposition mystified
me.

418
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,390
Why on earth would I get excited?

419
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,600
There had been interesting, sometimes even
enjoyable bits along the way - selling the

420
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,350
rights to the book for an unfeasibly large
sum of money, for example, meeting the people

421
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,769
responsible for the film version, seeing the
end product, which I liked a lot.

422
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:54,470
I'd be very suspicious, however, of any writer
who was actually excited by any of this process,

423
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,970
which can be on occasion distasteful (About
A Boy ate up a director and got spat out by

424
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:06,430
another film company even before it was made)
and stupefying prolonged; indeed, the time

425
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:11,889
before, during and after a film's release
is positively unpleasant.

426
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:16,470
You get reviewed all over again; you discover
that half your friends never read the book

427
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,340
in the first place; the bits of the film people
like the most turn out to be nothing to do

428
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,690
with you.

429
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:28,299
But the first time I heard the soundtrack
to the film really was exciting, in the proper,

430
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:30,490
tingly sense of the word.

431
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,539
Seeing one's words converted into Hollywood
cash is gratifying in all sorts of ways, but

432
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:40,590
it really cannot compare to the experience
of hearing them converted into music: for

433
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,919
someone who has to write books because he
cannot write songs, the idea that a book might

434
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,369
somehow produce a song is embarrassingly thrilling.

435
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:55,989
Like a lot of people, I spent a large chunk
of 2000 listening to and loving Badly Drawn

436
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,970
Boy's The Hour of the Bewilder beast album.

437
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:05,369
It's one of the very few English records of
recent years I've had any time for; it's thoughtful,

438
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:10,889
quirky without being inept (despite my earlier
presumption that the name of the artist was

439
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:15,809
somehow indicative of the ramshackle nature
of the music, a presumption that stopped me

440
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:21,840
from listening to him for a while), it's melodic,
it borrows lightly and judiciously from all

441
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,379
sorts of folky, rocky things I like (Damon
Gough is an early-Springsteen devotee), it

442
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:33,379
doesn't show off, it is un-English in the
sense that it wouldn't be much use to Ibiza

443
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:37,749
clubbers or boozed-up football hooligans,
it has soul.

444
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:43,059
It also sounds cinematic, with its little
snatches of orchestration (it begins with

445
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:48,630
a brass-band instrumental that would not have
sounded out of place in a gentle sixties comedy)

446
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,529
and its range of moods.

447
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:55,519
It seemed to me that Damon could write a wonderful
film score, and I would have suggested him

448
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,279
for About A Boy had I not known that writers
have less chance of influencing film adaptations

449
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,479
of their books than they do of changing the
weather.

450
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:09,460
And then, the first time we met, Chris and
Paul Weitz, the co-directors, told me that

451
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,859
they had already asked Damon to provide all
the music for the film.

452
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:18,600
This struck me as being troublingly neat - could
it really be possible that the music in my

453
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,809
head was the same as the music in theirs?

454
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:26,860
- but anyway, here I am, in my office, listening
to a whole lot of new Badly Drawn Boy songs

455
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,909
and music cues that very few people in the
world have heard yet, and feeling lucky.

456
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:40,029
I began writing About A Boy in 1996, the year
my son Danny was finally diagnosed as autistic.

457
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:46,269
There were lots of things to think (or panic,
or despair, or lose sleep) about, and money

458
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:51,249
was only one of them, but I suddenly went
from feeling reasonably wealthy - I was in

459
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:55,799
my fourth year of earning a decent whack from
writing, and for the first time in my life

460
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,320
I had some savings - to financially vulnerable:
I was going to have to find enough to make

461
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,379
sure that my son was secure, not just for
the duration of my life, but for the duration

462
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:12,730
of his, and that extra thirty or forty years
was hard to contemplate, in more or less any

463
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,770
direction.

464
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:19,379
And then, no sooner had these worries begun
to take hold and chafe a little bit than this

465
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,500
Hollywood money arrived.

466
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,730
Until the movie was made, this was the only
connection I had forged between the book and

467
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,730
Danny.

468
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:32,389
The character of Marcus was nothing to do
with him (Marcus is twelve, and brightly voluble,

469
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,280
if odd; Danny was three, and five years later
is still unable to speak), and I don't think

470
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,560
that Danny would recognize the parenting that
Marcus experiences.

471
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,840
It's possible that, if I had been child-less,
I would have been attracted to a different

472
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,179
kind of story, but that's the only way that
About A Boy is about Danny.

473
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:59,480
'A Minor Incident', a sweet, heartfelt, acoustic
strummer with a wheezy Dylanesque harmonica

474
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,309
solo, refers directly to a major incident
in the book and the movie: Marcus comes home

475
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:10,820
from a day out to discover his mother, Fiona,
lying comatose on the sofa after an attempt

476
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,480
to kill herself, her vomit on the floor beside
her.

477
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,340
The song is her suicide note to her son.

478
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:22,340
I wrote one for her too, but it wasn't in
the form of a song lyric, and Damon's words

479
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,000
capture Fiona's dippy, depressive insouciance
perfectly.

480
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,330
But here's the thing: once I'd listened to
'A Minor Incident' a couple of times, it started

481
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,260
to make me think of Danny in ways that I hadn't
done when I was writing the book.

482
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,700
'You always were the one to make us stand
out in a crowd I Though every once in a while

483
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:48,280
your head was in a cloud I There's nothing
you could never do to ever let me down', sings

484
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,120
Damon as Fiona, and the lines brought me up
short.

485
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,630
Autistic children are by their nature the
dreamiest of kids, and Danny's ways of making

486
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:02,710
us stand out in a crowd can include attempts
to steal strangers' crisps and to get undressed

487
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,680
on the top of a number 19 bus.

488
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,680
But that peculiar negative in the last line...

489
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,910
How did Badly Drawn Boy know that it's the
things that Danny will never do (talk, read,

490
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,750
play football, all sorts of stuff) that make
those who love him feel the most fiercely

491
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,930
proud and protective of him?

492
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:27,160
And, suddenly, five years on, I find a mournful
undertow of identification in the lyric to

493
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,329
the song, because the money from the sale
of the film rights has forced me to contemplate

494
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:37,440
my own mortality; like Fiona, I'm thinking
of a time when I won't be around for Danny

495
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,280
- for different reasons, but the end result
is the same.

496
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,740
So there we go.

497
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:50,589
That's where the excitement lies: in the magical
coincidences and transferences of creativity.

498
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:55,830
I write a book that isn't about my kid, and
then someone writes a beautiful song based

499
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,500
on an episode in my book that turns out to
mean something much more personal to me than

500
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,650
my book ever did.

501
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,160
And I won't say that this sort of thing is
worth more than all the Hollywood money in

502
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,380
the world, because I'm a pragmatist, and that
Hollywood money has given Danny a trust fund

503
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,799
which will hopefully see him through those
terrifying thirty or forty years.

504
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:22,599
But it's worth an awful lot, something money
can't buy, and it makes me want to keep writing

505
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,049
and collaborating, in the hope that something
I write will strike this kind of dazzling,

506
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:32,560
serendipitous spark off someone again.

507
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,490
CHAPTER SIX
Caravan - Van Morrison

508
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,840
The magnificent version of 'Caravan' on It's
Too Late to Stop Now (Van Morrison's most

509
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,309
enjoyable album, unarguably, so don't even
think about arguing) sounds to me like it

510
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:52,990
could be played over the closing credits of
the best film you've ever seen; and if something

511
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,799
sounds like that to you, then surely by extension
it means that it could also be played at your

512
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,390
own funeral.

513
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,960
I don't think this is over-dramatizing the
importance of one's own life.

514
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,970
Not all films have to be like Lawrence of
Arabia or Apocalypse Now, and you'd have to

515
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,200
have been pretty unlucky, at least in our
part of the world (and if you walked into

516
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,130
a bookshop and bought this book, you live
in the part I'm talking about), not to have

517
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:25,770
experienced a few moments of joy or pure hope
or clenched-fist triumph or simple contentment

518
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,390
amongst all the drudgery and heartbreak and
pain.

519
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:35,579
To me, 'Cara-van' recognizes and synthesizes
all of it, and the fact that what it produces

520
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,329
from the whole extraordinary mess is something
that sounds cheerful doesn't mean that the

521
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:43,289
song is trite.

522
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:48,490
'Caravan' isn't a song about life or death,
as far as I can tell: it's a song about merry

523
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,839
gypsies and campfires and turning up your
radio and stuff.

524
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,140
But in its long, vamped passage right before
the cli-max, when the sax weaves gently in

525
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,880
and out of the cute, witty, neochamber strings,
while the piano sprinkles bluesy high notes

526
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,299
over the top, Morrison's band seems to isolate
a moment somewhere between life and its aftermath,

527
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:15,670
a big, baroque entrance hall of a place where
you can stop and think about everything that

528
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,980
has gone before.

529
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
(Gosh.

530
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,940
A sudden panic: can you hear any of that,
those of you who already own the album or

531
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,760
who are interested enough in this description
to check it out?

532
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Possibly not.

533
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,450
But - panic over - this book isn't predicated
on you and me sharing the ability to hear

534
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,380
exactly the same things; in other words, it
isn't music criticism.

535
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,089
All I'm hoping here is that you have equivalents
that you spend a lot of time listening to

536
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,140
music and seeing faces in its fire.)

537
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,690
And, though it won't be me doing the thinking,
as far as we know, is it arrogant to expect

538
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,530
a little reflection from friends and family?

539
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,670
It's my funeral, after all.

540
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,920
And they don't have to think only about me;
they can think about all sorts of things,

541
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,779
as long as they're worthy of the occasion
and the music, and don't involve foodstuffs,

542
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,500
emails, footwear, etc.

543
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,920
The only thing that worries me about having
'Caravan' played at my funeral is that string

544
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
section.

545
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,460
Will people think I'm making some concession
to classical music when they hear it?

546
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,529
Will they say to themselves, 'What a shame
he lost the courage of his convictions right

547
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:26,140
at the end there, just like everybody else'?

548
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,290
I wouldn't want them to think that.

549
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,430
Unless something unimaginable happens to me
over the next couple of decades, I will have

550
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,609
gone through an entire life listening more
or less only to popular music in one or other

551
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:38,609
of its forms.

552
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:44,750
(I have a few classical CDs, and sometimes
I play them, too; but I never respond to Mozart

553
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,450
or Haydn as music, merely as something that
makes the room smell temporarily different,

554
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,980
like a scented candle, and I don't like treating
art in that way, with disrespect.)

555
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,920
And I'm unrepentant, too.

556
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,869
'I'd see him banged up for having anything
to do with the inanity that is pop, full stop,'

557
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:08,109
said a famously sour writer and newspaper
columnist recently, while attempting to defend

558
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:12,640
a well-known music-business mogul who had
just been imprisoned, but you've heard this

559
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,170
stuff before.

560
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:19,440
I have no idea whether his use of the word
'pop' is the same as mine, whether he thinks

561
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,990
that all of it, Dylan and Marvin Gaye and
Neil Young, is inane.

562
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,619
I suspect he does.

563
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,680
It's not a complaint I've ever understood,
because music, like colour, or a cloud, is

564
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,780
neither intelligent nor unintelligent - it
just is.

565
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,760
The chord, the simplest building-block for
even the tri test, silliest chart song, is

566
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,170
a beautiful, perfect, mysterious thing, and
when an ill-read, uneducated, uncultured,

567
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,660
emotionally illiterate boor puts a couple
of them together, he has every chance of creating

568
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,280
something wonderful and powerful.

569
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,609
I don't want to read inane books, but books
are built from words, our only instruments

570
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:06,470
of thought; all I ask of music is that it
sounds good.

571
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:12,020
Despite its crudity and simplicity, 'Twist
and Shout' sounds good - in fact, any attempt

572
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,420
to sophisticate it would make it sound much
worse - and I fundamentally, profoundly disagree

573
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:24,279
with anyone who equates musical complication
and intelligence with superiority.

574
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:29,980
It doesn't work like that, which is maybe
why these people despise pop music, because

575
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,130
it's one of the very few things that doesn't.

576
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,930
(They often hate sports, too.)

577
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,700
I don't dislike classical music because of
its cultivation - I'm not an inverted snob.

578
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:47,510
I dislike it (or at least, I'm unaffected
by it) because it sounds churchy, and because,

579
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:52,930
to my ears at least, it can't deal with the
smaller feelings that constitute a day and

580
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:59,579
a week and a life, and because there are no
backing vocals or basslines or guitar solos,

581
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,150
and because a lot of people who profess to
like it actually don't really like any music

582
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:10,510
(or any culture) at all, and because I grew
up listening to something else, and because

583
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:16,730
it does not possess the ability to make me
feel, and because I don't need my music to

584
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:22,640
sound any 'better' than it does already - a
great, farting, squelching, quick-witted sax

585
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,340
solo does the job for me.

586
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,170
So 'Caravan' will be played at my funeral.

587
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,720
The problem with the extended passage that
I mentioned earlier, the bit that I hope will

588
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,829
make the mourners think and reflect is that...

589
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:42,500
Well, OK, here's the thing: it's the bit where
Van Morrison introduces the band.

590
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,569
'Terry Adams on cello...

591
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:46,569
Nancy Ellis on viola...

592
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:48,309
Bill Elwin on trumpet...

593
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:50,460
David Hayes on bass...'

594
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,780
Is that too weird?

595
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,579
Can people really file out of my funeral listening
to a list of names of people they (and I)

596
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,359
don't know?

597
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:03,880
I've started to think of this passage as a
sort of metaphorical dramatis personae now:

598
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,160
granted, I don't know David Hayes or Nancy
Ellis, but, you know... I probably knew someone

599
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,470
like them.

600
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,792
That's the best I can come up with, and it'll
have to do, because I'm not changing my mind,

601
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:16,792
so there.

602
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:16,794
- THE END -
