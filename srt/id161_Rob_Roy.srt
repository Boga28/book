00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,280
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,840
Exiled from London

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,400
Dear Will, do you remember 
me? I am Frank Osbaldistone  

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
and I want to narrate the 
adventurous story of my early life.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,960
It was the year 1714 and I was about twenty. My 
father ordered me to come back from Bordeaux,  

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
France, where I worked and to return to London.  

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,080
My father was the founder of the business 
house Osbaldistone & Tresham, with offices  

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,520
in Crane Alley, London. He was a tall man, 
full of energy, with dark, penetrating eyes.  

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,840
He had a fiery spirit, full of initiative and 
acute powers of analysis. He never used a word  

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,520
in vain, and he never got really angry, but when 
he was displeased, he spoke in a brusque manner.

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,720
My father wanted me to become his successor 
in the family business, but I preferred to  

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,120
study literature and write poems. He tried 
everything to convince me to change my mind  

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,960
and eventually threatened, "I have a brother in 
Northumberland and he too has children, Frank.  

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,360
I will ask one of your cousins to take your 
place in the business, if you do not obey me."

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,080
Showing little respect for his wishes, I replied,  

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,960
"You can do as you please - the business is 
yours! I will never sell my liberty for gold!"

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,440
As I was very obstinate, in the end my 
father decided to send me to his brother  

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,840
at Osbaldistone Hall in the north of England.

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,520
The following morning I took the road to York, 
mounted on a good horse and with sixty guineas  

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,440
in my pocket. I was sad, but I did not want to 
go back to London. I wanted to show my father  

21
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,040
that I was adult enough to decide for myself 
and that I was truly convinced of my decision.

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
The journey was monotonous, but sometimes 
I had the opportunity to speak to different  

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,080
travellers - parsons, farmers, officers. 
We spoke of many different matters - taxes,  

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,040
markets, wars and outlaws. One man that I met, 
a Mr Morris, was particularly afraid of outlaws.  

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,240
He had a heavy portmanteau which he 
never abandoned for a moment. He never  

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,840
mentioned his destination, he trusted 
nobody and he was afraid of me, too.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,360
In those days travellers used to break their 
journey on Sundays. They rested their horses  

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,240
and had dinner together at the local inn, 
where the innkeeper offered them a meal.  

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,960
On this particular Sunday I stopped at Darlington,  

30
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,160
at the "Black Bear", with my new 
companion, the strange Mr Morris.  

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,960
A Scotsman, Mr Campbell, joined us for dinner. 
It was the first time I had met a Scotsman and  

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,200
I looked at him with curiosity because I had many 
prejudices against the inhabitants of Scotland.  

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,880
When I was a child my nurse told me terrible 
stories about them, of blood and revenge.  

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,680
I considered the Scottish people dishonest, 
avaricious and hostile to Englishmen.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Mr Campbell was a tall, athletic man who 
spoke to other people with superiority.

36
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,600
Strangely, my timorous companion Mr Morris 
asked if he could travel north with him,  

37
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,760
but Mr Campbell refused. "Your 
companion talks too much," he said.  

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:13,840
"It is unsafe to say where you are 
going in these troubled times."
 
 

39
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,840
CHAPTER TWO

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
The Osbaldistones

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,160
The following morning, I left the company 
to go westward where my uncle lived in  

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Osbaldistone Hall. The landscape was romantic and 
picturesque and appealed to my love of nature.  

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,840
I went past rivers and little solitary 
valleys until I arrived at Osbaldistone Hall.  

44
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,200
The house was in a glen between two 
mountains, surrounded by a large wood of oaks.

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,240
I was on a hill above Osbaldistone Hall when I  

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,840
heard the sound of dogs and 
horses - it was a fox hunt.  

47
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
I saw some men, dressed in green and red uniforms,  

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
riding after the fox and I 
thought: 'Here are my cousins.'

49
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,280
Suddenly I had a vision - a beautiful young 
lady appeared in front of me. Her face was  

50
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,320
uncommonly fine and animated by the hunt. She 
had long, black hair down to her shoulders.  

51
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,920
She was wearing riding clothes, like a 
man, and rode a splendid black horse.

52
00:05:49,920 --> 00:06:05,840
Just then the sound of a horn 
announced the end of the chase.  

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,440
A young man came triumphantly towards us. 
He was carrying the fox's tail in his hand.  

54
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,720
The young woman spoke to him, then 
she turned to me and said, "Excuse me,  

55
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,760
did you meet a young man on 
the road, a Mr Osbaldistone?"

56
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,400
"I am Francis Osbaldistone," I answered.

57
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
"Ah... I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Osbaldistone.  

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,320
This young man is Thorncliff Osbaldistone, your 
cousin, and I am Diana Vernon," she continued.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Diana accompanied me to Osbaldistone Hall, 
where my uncle, Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone,  

60
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,240
welcomed me. He was a man of about sixty,  

61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,240
dressed in hunting clothes. Once he had been 
a soldier and a knight under King James II.  

62
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,200
Alter the king's deposition, he retired to his 
lands in the countryside where he was lord.

63
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,440
"These are your cousins, Francis," 
he told me. "Percie, Thornie,  

64
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,120
John, Dick, Wilfred and Rashleigh. The 
girl you met earlier is Die Vernon, Diana,  

65
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,000
my dead wife's niece. She lives here 
too. Now, shall we have dinner together?"

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
My cousins were all tall, 
well-built and good-humoured,  

67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,160
with the exception of Rashleigh. He was 
different from the others - short, thin, lame,  

68
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,160
and his expression was cruel. However, these 
disadvantages were partly compensated for  

69
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,840
by his very soft, sweet voice and his 
great ability in putting words together.

70
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,760
Diana Vernon was sitting next to me at dinner 
and gave me some information about my cousins.  

71
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,000
"Rashleigh," she said, "wanted to become 
a priest in the Roman Catholic Church,  

72
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,240
but his deformity prevented him 
from entering the seminary."  

73
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,720
She also revealed that my father had chosen 
Rashleigh to take my place in his company.

74
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
After dinner my cousins started 
to drink and laugh immoderately.  

75
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,800
As my foreign education had given me a dislike 
for intemperance, I preferred to be alone and  

76
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,960
decided to go for a walk in the garden. On 
one of the little paths I met a gardener.  

77
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,600
He touched his Scottish bonnet with an air of 
respect. "Good evening, my Lord!" he said. "I am  

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,520
Andrew Fairservice. For twenty-four years I have 
served the Osbaldistones." He was very talkative.  

79
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,640
He told me that he was a Presbyterian and when he 
heard that I was an English dissenter, he took out  

80
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,080
a tobacco box and offered me a little. I asked 
him about Die Vernon. "Oh, the young mistress?  

81
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,840
The lassie Vernon?" he answered. "She is a 
Catholic and, what is worse, she is a Jacobite!"
 
 

82
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
CHAPTER THREE

83
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,840
Accused of Robbery!

84
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,120
I went to bed that night, thinking about the 
strange Osbaldistone family, my father, Rashleigh  

85
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,920
and Die Vernon. When I woke up, I heard the horn 
announcing that the fox hunt was beginning again.  

86
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,160
In the courtyard, where men, dogs 
and horses were in full preparation,  

87
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,960
I met Die Vernon. We left with 
the rest of the hunting party,  

88
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:36,080
but after a few miles we were alone. Die guided 
me to the top of a hill, and stopped her horse  

89
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,280
under some trees. She indicated some mountains 
on the far horizon. She said that they were  

90
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,800
in Scotland and that if necessary my 
horse could take me there in two hours.

91
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
I was surprised. I had no 
desire to go to Scotland.

92
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,400
"What should I do in Scotland?" I asked.

93
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
"Provide for your safety..." she replied.

94
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,600
"Didn't you travel here with a man, 
a Mr Morris?" the girl asked me then.

95
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,480
"Well... yes. I travelled with a strange little 
man who was always worried about his portmanteau,"  

96
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
I answered, slowly.

97
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
"Someone stole that bag, Frank!" explained Die.

98
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,720
"You do not think I am a 
thief!" I replied, angrily.

99
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
"Mr Morris is an agent for the 
London government," she continued.

100
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
"He was carrying important documents and 
money for the English soldiers in the north.  

101
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,400
You are accused of robbery and 
of treason, Frank Osbaldistone!"

102
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,120
"So, I am a traitor, too!" I exclaimed angrily.

103
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,520
She saw I was angry and tried to console me.  

104
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,160
"Around here many important people are 
in favour of James II and against the  

105
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,880
Hanoverians," she said. "Your crime is considered 
the crime of a gentleman - and a kings man."

106
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,840
"But I want to refute this terrible accusation! 
Who is examining my case?" I demanded.

107
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,480
"Judge Ingle wood. He told my uncle to show 
you the road to Scotland," replied Die.

108
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,840
"Then I must see him and tell him the truth!"

109
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
Diana insisted on accompanying me.  

110
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,200
When we arrived, we were surprised to meet 
Rashleigh coming out of Judge Ingle wood's house.

111
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,280
The Judge was having lunch when we 
entered. Another man was with him  

112
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,480
at the table - it was Mr Morris, 
my timorous travelling companion.  

113
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,160
He said that one of the robbers had 
mentioned the name of Osbaldistone.

114
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
"But that is not a good reason 
to accuse me!" I replied.

115
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,960
At that moment, the servant announced 
the arrival of another gentleman  

116
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,400
and I was surprised to see Mr Campbell, the 
other man I had met on my journey north.  

117
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,800
He explained to Judge Inglewood that he had been 
with Mr Morris when the bandits attacked him.

118
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
"Why didn't you help Mr 
Morris, then?" asked the Judge.

119
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
"Mr Morris is strong enough to defend himself,"  

120
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,320
he replied coldly. "I am a man of peace. I do 
not want to have trouble with the Law. But of  

121
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,840
one thing I am sure - Mr Osbaldistone was 
not one of the bandits who stole the bag."

122
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,080
At that point, Mr Morris retracted his accusations 
against me and the Judge declared I was innocent.  

123
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,840
Soon after, Mr Morris left 
the house with Campbell.

124
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Die Vernon and I rode back to Osbaldistone Hall.  

125
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,200
The girl started to tell me something of 
her life. She had many troubles, she said.

126
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,600
I tried to learn more but she replied 
mysteriously, "I cannot reveal my secrets."

127
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:18,320
At Osbaldistone Hall, Die ordered dinner for us 
in the library. The ancient, dark library was full  

128
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:27,200
of books, very untidy and neglected. On one wall 
was a portrait of Die's grandfather, Lord Vernon,  

129
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,320
with the Vernon motto above it. He had been loyal 
to the Kings of the Stuart dynasty, she said,  

130
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:42,480
and had shared the misfortunes of Charles I. The 
Vernon family, once important, was now ruined.

131
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,760
During our meal, Rashleigh entered.

132
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,640
"I must thank you for calling Mr 
Campbell. His defence saved me,"  

133
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,320
I said. I was curious and wanted to 
learn more about the connection between  

134
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:11,840
Rashleigh and Campbell, so we continued 
to talk until Diana went to bed.
 
 

135
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,840
CHAPTER FOUR

136
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
New Troubles

137
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:37,040
The following day was Sunday, a dull day at 
Osbaldistone Hall. We all attended the formal  

138
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,720
religious service in the morning and, when 
it was over, Sir Hildebrand congratulated me.

139
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,120
"Ha ha! So you did not go 
to prison after all, my lad!  

140
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,880
You were lucky this time - 
but do not tempt Fate again!"

141
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,320
His words embarrassed and irritated me.

142
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,240
"On my honour, sir!" I replied. "I am innocent. 
I was not involved in that detestable crime!"

143
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,840
I was saved from more embarrassment 
by the arrival of Rashleigh.  

144
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,440
He was leaving soon for London and 
wanted to know more about my father,  

145
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,960
his relations with me and about the business. 
I, however, was more curious to find out about  

146
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:29,040
Die Vernon. "We were close friends once and 
I was her tutor," he said. "Then my studies  

147
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:36,320
took me far from her. She must now decide between 
life in a convent or a convenient marriage.  

148
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,440
She is engaged to Thorncliff, my brother. But I 
am convinced that I am better qualified for her."

149
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:54,640
These words hurt me and that evening, when 
I met Die, I was cold and rude to her.  

150
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,560
At dinner I drank too much and so I talked 
too much, quarrelled and laughed immoderately.  

151
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:10,000
Rapidly I lost all control. It seemed to 
me that Rashleigh was making insinuations  

152
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,960
about my feelings for Die, and, 
furious with him, I slapped his face.

153
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,080
My cousins took me by force to 
my room and locked the door.  

154
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,200
I slept badly and the next morning I 
knew I must apologise for my behaviour.  

155
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,840
My cousins accepted my excuses - 
only Rashleigh showed his resentment.  

156
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,720
I also apologized to Diana 
for my discourtesy to her.  

157
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,080
She insisted on knowing what had provoked 
my bad humour and, embarrassed, I told her.  

158
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,240
She answered that I had to be careful when 
speaking to Rashleigh. I decided then that I  

159
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,520
had to inform my father about my cousin's 
true character and wrote him a letter.

160
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,440
It was after this that I 
realized how much Miss Vernon  

161
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,840
and the secrets around her occupied 
my thoughts - I was falling in love!  

162
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,760
Rashleigh left the Hall for London and after his 
departure I started to help Die with her studies.  

163
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,560
I discovered that while she had had an 
extremely good education, she was totally  

164
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,640
ignorant of real life beyond the Hall and 
knew nothing of accepted feminine behaviour.

165
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,200
One day Andrew Fairservice, the gardener, informed 
me that news of the robbery incriminating me was  

166
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,560
circulating in London. I was anxious and decided 
to send another letter to my father to explain  

167
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:58,320
and rode into town to post it. At the post office 
I found a letter from Owen, my father's clerk,  

168
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,880
waiting for me. He said that he 
was worried because he had had no  

169
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,760
recent news from me. He did not mention my 
previous message concerning Rashleigh, and so  

170
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,760
I became suspicious. "Does someone intercept 
my letters at Osbaldistone Hall?" I wondered.

171
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
That evening, when I was in the garden, 
I saw a light at the library window.  

172
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,560
This was not unusual because 
Diana often read there alone,  

173
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:38,240
but I was surprised when I observed the shadows of 
two people inside. After that I became jealous and  

174
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,840
started to watch Miss Vernon's looks and actions. 
I was desperate to know who visited her in the  

175
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,680
library. The next time I saw the light there 
again, I ran into the library but I found Diana  

176
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:02,000
alone. However, there was a man's glove on the 
table. Diana refused to give me any explanation.  

177
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,600
With an air of authority she told me I 
should spend my time in a better way,  

178
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,640
instead of spying on her. Then she gave 
me a letter which had arrived for me.

179
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,040
"Gracious heaven!" I cried. "My folly 
and disobedience have ruined my father!  

180
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,920
This letter says that Rashleigh has gone to 
Scotland. During my father's absence in Holland,  

181
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Rashleigh left London taking documents 
and large sums of money from the company.  

182
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,520
Mr Owen is now in Scotland too, in Glasgow, 
trying to discover where Rashleigh is hiding."

183
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,560
I decided I had to go to Scotland immediately 
to help my father's clerk. Before I left,  

184
00:20:48,560 --> 00:21:01,840
Diana gave me a sealed packet without an address, 
and ordered me to open it only in an emergency.
 
 

185
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
CHAPTER FIVE

186
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
Reunion with a Friend

187
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,880
I asked Andrew Fairservice to accompany me into 
Scotland because I did not know the country. We  

188
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,640
met at three in the morning because we didn't want 
to wake the Osbaldistone family. On a Saturday  

189
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,840
evening, after a long ride, we arrived in Glasgow, 
the principal town in the west of Scotland.

190
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,360
The next morning all the bells of the city 
announced the sanctity of the day, Sunday.  

191
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,240
I wanted to start looking for 
Owen immediately, but Andrew said,  

192
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
"You cannot do anything until 
the church service is over."

193
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,920
So I decided to go to the cathedral of Glasgow, a 
solid and massive example of Gothic architecture.  

194
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,240
While all the people were silent 
and listening to the sermon,  

195
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,520
a voice from behind me whispered distinctly 
in my ear: "You are in danger in this city!  

196
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,920
Meet me tonight at the Brigg at twelve precisely."

197
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,080
I turned round, but there was no one there.

198
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
I spent the rest of the day at the 
inn reflecting on what I should do.  

199
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
In the end I decided to go to 
the appointment on the bridge.

200
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,080
I waited on the bridge in the dark. I was 
very apprehensive. What was going to happen.  

201
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,000
Then the clock struck midnight,  

202
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,240
and suddenly a stranger appeared near me 
and said, "Mr Osbaldistone, follow me!"

203
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,240
I hesitated and replied, "Can't 
you give me your information here?"

204
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:30,240
"You must receive it from your eyes, not from my 
tongue," he said. "You must follow me, or remain  

205
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,640
in ignorance." So I obeyed and was surprised 
when the man led me to... Glasgow prison!

206
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,640
The prison guard, a Highlander called 
Dougal, seemed happy to see my companion.  

207
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,360
He took us upstairs to a cell where a prisoner was 
sitting dejected in the corner: it was Mr Owen!  

208
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,000
He recognized me and exclaimed, 
"What! You are here too? Oh! Mr Frank,  

209
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,120
your company is ruined and now you are 
in a Scottish prison! God help us!"

210
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,360
I assured him that I was not a prisoner 
and asked him to explain what had happened.  

211
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
What was he doing in Glasgow prison?  

212
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,560
He told me that my father had two 
correspondents for his business in Scotland,  

213
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,520
the house of MacVittie-MacFin & Co. and the 
Bailie, Mr Nicol Jarvie. They transacted a great  

214
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,640
deal of business for the London firm and Owen 
had gone to see them when he arrived in the city.

215
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,720
"I immediately contacted MacVittie and MacFin,"  

216
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,320
said Owen. "They had always professed themselves 
obliged and devoted to Mr Osbaldistone,  

217
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,440
so I openly revealed the present difficulties of 
the house caused by the absence of your father  

218
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,200
and the disappearance of Rashleigh. I asked for 
counsel and financial assistance regarding the  

219
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,640
next payments, but when they discovered they 
had large credits with Osbaldistone & Tresham,  

220
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,680
they refused to help me. They had me arrested 
and sent to prison as a debtor instead!"

221
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,640
Just then we were interrupted by a loud knocking 
on the prison door. A few minutes later,  

222
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,000
Bailie Jarvie himself came in and spoke 
to Owen, asking to see his papers.

223
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,320
He examined them with great attention, then said,  

224
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,360
"You owe money to several people in Glasgow. But 
you cannot pay your debts if you are in prison.  

225
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,520
I will act as your guarantor 
and they will let you go free."

226
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,600
Bailie Jarvie took the lamp and 
scrutinized the other people in the room.

227
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:56,480
"Ah! Eh! Oh! My conscience! 
It's impossible and yet... no!  

228
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,600
You robber, you devil that you are! Can 
this be you, Robin?" exclaimed the Bailie.

229
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,320
"That is so," was my guide's laconic answer.

230
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,400
Mr Jarvie also wanted to know 
who I was and then asked me,  

231
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,600
"Young man, how will you find the five thousand 
pounds to pay your father's bills in three days?"

232
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
I didn't know what to say, then 
suddenly I remembered Diana's packet.  

233
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,240
I opened the seal and a letter dropped 
onto the floor at Mr Jarvie's feet.  

234
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,280
After examining the name on the 
envelope, he gave it to Robin.  

235
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,360
I realized then that my mysterious 
guide was in fact Mr Campbell himself!  

236
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,800
I recognized his deep voice, his 
severe face, and his Scottish accent.

237
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,760
Mr Campbell read the letter, then 
instructed Owen to remain in Glasgow.  

238
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,680
He told me Bailie Jarvie and I should 
go to his Highland home in the glens.

239
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,240
The next day I went to the Bailie's home for lunch 
and found Owen there. The honest man was depressed  

240
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,720
after his stay in the prison but Mr Jarvie's 
kind and friendly interest in my fathers affairs  

241
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,920
consoled him. I asked the Bailie to 
tell me something about Robert Campbell.  

242
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:37,760
"He is a distant cousin of mine. Many people 
have been cruel to him. He is a Highland cattle  

243
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,600
merchant that wears the tartan when he is in 
the hills and trousers when he is in Glasgow!"  

244
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:53,280
explained the magistrate. Then he started to 
examine some business documents with Owen. As  

245
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:01,840
I could not help them, Mr Jarvie suggested going 
out for a walk. I could return later for lunch.
 
 

246
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
CHAPTER SIX

247
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
An Unexpected Encounter

248
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,280
After Mr Jarvie's house, I directed 
my steps to the college grounds.  

249
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,560
While I was walking, my attention was attracted by 
three men who appeared at the end of the garden.  

250
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,600
I looked again and recognized Rashleigh 
with Mr Morris and Mr MacVittie!  

251
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,840
I did not want to be seen, so I hid behind some 
trees and came out only when the men separated.

252
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
I followed Rashleigh and took his arm to stop him.  

253
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,280
I was determined to demand reparation 
for the wrongs done to my father.

254
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,840
"I am glad to meet you at 
last!" were my first words.

255
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,720
"Oh, I am easily found by my friends 
and more easily still by my enemies,"  

256
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,360
replied Rashleigh coolly. "Which 
of the two are you, Mr Francis?"

257
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,600
"I will be an enemy, if you do not 
immediately render justice to your  

258
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,040
benefactor, my father," I said.

259
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,200
"Why should I justify my actions to a 
young gentleman who has no inclination  

260
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
for business matters? Go, young man,  

261
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,840
and amuse yourself in the world of your poetical 
imagination!" replied my cousin insolently.

262
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,440
"This is no answer for the 
wrongs done to my father!  

263
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,040
You must come with me to the magistrate and give 
me full satisfaction!" I exclaimed, angrily.

264
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,000
"You insulted me once before, remember!" 
hissed Rashleigh. "Your insolence  

265
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,400
merits personal punishment. Now, follow me 
to a place where we cannot be interrupted!"

266
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:25,200
I followed him, watching him attentively 
because I knew that he was treacherous. In fact  

267
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,120
I had no time to take off my cloak and take out 
my sword before he was on me. He attacked me  

268
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,360
without warning and I only saved my life by 
springing back. Rashleigh fought furiously.  

269
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,640
After the first impulse of passion, I reflected 
that Rashleigh was my cousin, the son of my uncle,  

270
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,360
and decided to try and disarm him only. But I 
soon realized that I had met my match - the combat  

271
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,000
seemed destined to have a tragic end. I slipped, 
Rashleigh's sword passed through my waistcoat,  

272
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:07,520
grazed my ribs and ran through my coat behind. I 
thought that I was fatally wounded and assaulted  

273
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,280
my opponent, ready now to kill him. At that 
moment a man stepped between us and separated us,  

274
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,240
exclaiming, "What? The sons of two brothers doing 
this! I will break your heads if you continue!"

275
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,760
I looked up in surprise. 
The speaker was Mr Campbell.

276
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,440
"Are you hurt, lad?" he asked me. Then, 
turning to Rashleigh: "Do you think men  

277
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,480
will trust their lives and fortunes to one 
who goes around quarrelling like a drunk man?"

278
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,040
After a few more quiet words he sent Rashleigh 
away and again invited me to be prudent and to  

279
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,640
stay at home. Then he disappeared and left me to 
reflect upon the singular events of the morning.

280
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,840
I tried to adjust my dress and to hide the 
blood which was flowing down my right side.  

281
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,120
On the way to Mr Jarvie's house I stopped at a 
little shop, an apothecary's, where a lively,  

282
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,680
elderly man treated my wound and laughed 
at the excuse which I gave him for it.

283
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,800
"Ah! Young blood! Young blood!" he repeated.

284
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,880
"What made you so late?" asked Mr 
Jarvie when I returned. I made my  

285
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,280
apologies but did not tell him what had 
happened. Soon we were seated at table  

286
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:41,840
where the Bailie entertained me with 
great hospitality and good humour.
 
 

287
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
CHAPTER SEVEN

288
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
The Journey Begins

289
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,720
We ended the meal with some brandy-punch.

290
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,240
"The limes," Mr Jarvie assured us proudly, 
"come from my little farm overseas.  

291
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,000
I made the liquor myself!" This led to a 
conversation between Mr Owen and our host  

292
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,040
about the possibility, which the government 
had recently given to Scottish towns,  

293
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:39,680
to trade with the British colonies in America 
and the West Indies. I was silent and,  

294
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,840
when the Bailie questioned me, I related the 
events of the morning and anxiously asked him,  

295
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,840
"What should I do to help my 
father and satisfy my own honour?"

296
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,880
"I think that Robin will help you, if he can. 
He is a good-hearted man," replied the Bailie.

297
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,880
"Can I consider Mr Campbell an honest 
man?" I continued. "Can I go to the  

298
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,240
appointment in the glens safely, and 
believe in a man who fears justice?"

299
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,320
Mr Jarvie explained that in 
the Highlands there was no law  

300
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,600
and no magistrates. The country was savage 
and poor, and people often became bandits.  

301
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,080
Robin Campbell, once an honest and active man of 
noble lineage, became an outlaw, known as Rob Roy,  

302
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,040
when his creditors took everything he had. 
Here Mr Jarvie's face became very sad.

303
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,280
"Rob was away on business," he said, "and when he 
came home, he found desolation where he had left  

304
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:57,280
plenty; he looked east, west, south, 
north and he saw no hope, no shelter!"

305
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,760
The Bailies voice showed his affection 
and sympathy for Campbell's misfortunes.

306
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,720
"Robin put on his bonnet, took his big 
sword and collected a band of blue bonnets.  

307
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,560
He and his men started to protect the 
lands and cattle of the southern farmers  

308
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,120
from robbers, in exchange for money."

309
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,440
"Oh, a very singular contract 
of insurance! The robbers who  

310
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,720
threaten the southern farmers are those same 
Highlanders!" exclaimed Owen at this point.

311
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,000
This form of blackmail was against the law,  

312
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,320
and Rob risked capture and death 
if he was found in Glasgow.

313
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,840
"He is a sort of Robin Hood!" concluded the 
Bailie. "I am convinced that he robbed Morris  

314
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,760
with the help of Rashleigh to accelerate the 
Jacobite rebellion against King George. He was  

315
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,240
certainly an agent between our Highland, chiefs 
and the gentlemen in the north of England."

316
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,880
The conversation went on, and gradually we came to  

317
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,600
the opinion that I should leave at once 
for the glens and meet Rob Roy there.

318
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,760
The next morning at five o'clock we started our 
journey. Mr Owen remained in Glasgow and Andrew  

319
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,520
came with us. We travelled all day, going 
north-east from Glasgow - first across a marshy  

320
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,640
barren land, then through a wild and desolate area 
with dark blue mountains visible in the distance.  

321
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,280
I began to appreciate Mr Jarvie. He had an 
observant mind and he knew the ancient history of  

322
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,120
the area. He was a good Scotsman that loved the 
traditions of his land, but he also understood  

323
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,600
the importance of the union with England for 
the future prosperity of his town and country.

324
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,520
We had lunch at noon at a most miserable 
alehouse, and then continued our journey quickly  

325
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,960
because we wanted to reach the clachan of Aberfoil  

326
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,160
before night fell. During the last three miles 
Mr Jarvie began to give Andrew his instructions.  

327
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:22,560
"Keep your tongue in your mouth, and don't say 
a word, good or bad, to anyone in the clacham!"  

328
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,760
he told him sharply. "And... remember, no 
blasting about your master's name - or mine!"

329
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:49,840
"I have many things of more importance to 
speak about!" was Andrew's indignant reply.
 
 

330
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,560
CHAPTER EIGHT

331
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,840
In the Highlands

332
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,720
At last we arrived at the inn at Aberfoil. There 
was a willow-branch across the half-opened door,  

333
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
blocking our entrance. Mr Jarvie told 
me that this meant there were some  

334
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Highland chiefs inside who 
did not want to be disturbed.  

335
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,640
After some discussion with the 
landlady we were allowed to enter.

336
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:35,200
Inside the inn was a large, bare room full 
of smoke, with a big fire blazing merrily  

337
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,440
in the centre. Three men were sitting at 
an old, scratched oak table near the fire.  

338
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,840
Two looked like Highlanders, 
judging by their clothes.  

339
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,640
The third was in the Lowlands 
dress and looked like a soldier.  

340
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,680
Another Highlander, all covered up by a plaid, was 
sleeping on the floor. It seemed that they did not  

341
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,000
pay any attention to us but when I ordered some 
food, one of them said to me in very good English,

342
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
"You think you are at home here, I see!"

343
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,800
His tone was offensive and a dispute started. In 
a few moments we were fighting - three against  

344
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,120
three I thought, but then I noticed that Andrew 
had vanished. The Bailie started well but he was  

345
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:29,280
corpulent and soon exhausted his energy. He 
was almost at die mercy of his antagonist,  

346
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,320
when suddenly the sleeping Highlander 
jumped up from his place on the floor and,  

347
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,640
placing himself between the two men, exclaimed, 
"This is Bailie Jarvie! I will defend him!"

348
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,680
At these words, with the cry "Hold 
your hands, hold your hands!",  

349
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,160
the fight stopped and we all sat down 
together and drank in friendship.

350
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,320
Supper was nearly ready so I went to look 
for Andrew. The landlady offered to guide  

351
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,080
me to the stable with a light and, when we 
were outside, she gave me a piece of paper.  

352
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,040
It was a message from Robin Campbell. He 
said that he could not come to the meeting,  

353
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,520
and advised me not to mix with the people 
at the inn because they were dangerous.

354
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,480
After looking for him everywhere 
finally discovered Andrew in the stable,  

355
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,840
hiding in a corner.

356
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,200
He was frightened and continued repeating: 
"I am an honest lad, sir! I am! I am!"

357
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,800
I requested an explanation and eventually he told 
me that he thought I was putting myself in extreme  

358
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,080
danger. "Take care of yourself, sir! Don't 
go near Rob Roy!" he said with sincere alarm.

359
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,200
We went back into the inn and found that 
Bailie Jarvie was now quarrelling with the tall  

360
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,560
Highlander. Then we heard the measured steps 
of soldiers, some orders were shouted outside,  

361
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:09,920
and an officer wearing a red coat came into the 
room. He looked severe. He addressed the three  

362
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,880
men. "I am Captain Thornton. You are, I suppose, 
the Major and the Highland gentlemen I had to  

363
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,000
meet in this place?" They nodded in agreement. 
Then, pointing to us, he continued, "Are these  

364
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,040
gentlemen with your group? I have orders to arrest 
an old person and a young one - as traitors!"

365
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,000
He looked hard at Mr Jarvie and 
me. "You two! What are your names?"

366
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,040
Mr Jarvie told him and when the officer heard 
the name Osbaldistone he ordered his soldiers  

367
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,600
to disarm and search me. They found the note 
from Mr Campbell, and decided that we had  

368
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,760
to be Rob Roy's spies. The officer decided 
to send us to the garrison with an escort.

369
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,560
We spent the rest of the night at the inn. I 
did not sleep well. I heard the soldiers going  

370
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,760
out many times on patrol, but apparently 
they did not find out the information the  

371
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:29,840
English officer wanted because he became 
more nervous each time they returned!
 
 

372
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
CHAPTER NINE

373
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,840
A Memorable Woman

374
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,000
Early the next morning some soldiers ran into the 
inn. They were dragging a Highlander triumphantly.  

375
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,360
I immediately recognized him - it was the 
prison guardian, Dougal, the very man who  

376
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:06,960
had defended Mr Jarvie! The Bailie recognized 
him too and exclaimed, "Mercy on us! They have  

377
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,320
taken that poor creature, Dougal! Captain, 
I will give you money for his liberty!"

378
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,440
The officer, however, paid no attention to the 
Bailie's request. Instead he started to question  

379
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,000
Dougal. He forced the Highlander to admit, with 
great reluctance and after many contradictions,  

380
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,080
that he knew Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell and 
that he had seen him only an hour before.

381
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,160
"And now, my friend," said the officer, 
"you will please tell me how many men  

382
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,360
your master has with him at present." 
Dougal looked away and replied slowly  

383
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:52,560
that he did not know. "Look at me, you Highland 
dog!" the officer threatened showing him a rope.  

384
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,880
"I'll hang you from the nearest tree if you 
do not take us to Rob Roy's hiding place!"

385
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,560
The soldiers got ready to move and we left the 
inn. I was glad to be outside in the refreshing  

386
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,600
fragrance of the morning air. I liked the woods 
around me, the mountain lake in the distance,  

387
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,200
the romantic solitude of the place where a man 
alone seemed to be in a state of inferiority.  

388
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,360
At one point the roadwe were following suddenly 
emerged from the forest and started to follow the  

389
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:35,840
shore of the lake. It gradually became narrow 
and steep, the ideal place for an ambush.

390
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,120
Suddenly a woman appeared on 
the summit of a rock above us.

391
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,080
"Stop!" she cried in a commanding tone. 
"What are you doing in MacGregor's country?"

392
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:56,240
She was an imposing woman of about fifty. Her 
face, once beautiful, was expressive but now  

393
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:04,160
full of lines. She wore a plaid wrapped around her 
body, as Highland soldiers do, and a man's bonnet  

394
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,720
with a feather. She was also carrying a sword in 
her hand, and had a pair of pistols in her belt.

395
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,800
"We are looking for Rob Roy MacGregor 
Campbell!" replied the officer. "Let us pass!  

396
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,320
We don't want to fight against a 
woman, we offer you civil treatment!"

397
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,080
"Ah!" shouted the woman. "I know your 
civil treatment! You have left me and  

398
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,920
mine no house and no bed, no cattle and no 
clothes! And now you come for our lives!"

399
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,640
"That's Helen Campbell, Robs wife!"  

400
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,840
whispered the Bailie to me. Suddenly the officer 
gave the order for the soldiers to charge.  

401
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,760
Guns flashed from various parts of the 
pass and three red-coats were killed.  

402
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,840
The captain prepared a second attack against the 
Highlanders, and Dougal, no longer under escort,  

403
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,520
escaped from his captors and began to ascend 
the mountainside with incredible agility.

404
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,320
I followed his example while the fire and 
the grenades exploded and hissed behind me,  

405
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,200
and I continued climbing until I was 
out of breath. Then I stopped and  

406
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,280
looked down. I saw the Bailie hanging in 
mid-air from the branch of a thorn tree.  

407
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,160
Andrew was on the top of a rock, exposed 
to all dangers, and was crying for mercy  

408
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,960
alternately in Gaelic and English. In spite 
of the danger the scene was very comical!

409
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:46,240
After a few minutes the guns stopped. Some of 
the soldiers were lying lifeless on the ground,  

410
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,760
the rest were in the hands of the Highlanders. 
I realized then for sure that Dougal was not  

411
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:00,880
a traitor. He had given false information to the 
officer to guide the soldiers into the ambush  

412
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:09,840
because he wanted to protect Mr Campbell, 
alias Robert MacGregor, alias Rob Roy!
 
 

413
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,560
CHAPTER TEN

414
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,480
Captured!

415
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,600
The Bailie and Andrew were soon treed 
from their uncomfortable position,  

416
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:47,680
and I joined them. Dougal came to our 
help, and took us to Rob Roy's wife.  

417
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:56,000
Helen MacGregor Campbell had not personally taken 
part in the fight, but her aspect was menacing:  

418
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,480
her hands and arms were naked, her 
face and sword were stained with blood,  

419
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,040
her hair was in a disorderly state, her eyes 
were inflamed by the triumph of victory.  

420
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840
She looked like a biblical heroine.

421
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,440
"I am very happy to have this joyful 
opportunity," said the Bailie.

422
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,640
"Do you remember me, Mrs MacGregor Campbell. I am 
your cousin, Nicol Jarvie, son of Deacon Jarvie."

423
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,360
He explained the connection between their two 
families, and talked of the times when Rob Roy  

424
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:47,840
had still been an honest cattle merchant. We were 
interrupted by the melancholy sound of bagpipes.

425
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Rob Roy's two sons arrived and 
I looked at them with interest.

426
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:15,440
The two boys were young - hardly twenty. 
The elder, Hamish, or James in English,  

427
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,200
was tall, fair and handsome, with blue 
eyes and a profusion of blond hair  

428
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:28,880
under his blue bonnet. The younger, Robert, 
or Oig in the language of the Highlanders,  

429
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:36,720
had dark hair and a dark complexion. He 
was a stout, strong boy, a real Highlander.

430
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,440
They brought bad news, however 
- their father had been captured  

431
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,320
and was now a prisoner of the English troops!  

432
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:53,200
But Helen MacGregor did not weep at their 
news. Instead she shouted at them furiously:

433
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,560
"Your father taken? A prisoner? And you,  

434
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,240
you are still alive! Better that 
you had died protecting him!"

435
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,480
Rob Roys sons stood in front of their 
mother and listened to her reproaching words  

436
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,080
silently. Their faces showed pain and shame.

437
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:17,840
She asked what had happened and Hamish told 
her how his father had fallen into a trap.  

438
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,400
He spoke in a low tone of voice and he 
spoke in English, probably because he  

439
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,040
did not want his followers to understand, but I 
was very near them and I could hear his story.

440
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,840
A man had brought Rob Roy a message from a person  

441
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:43,200
whose name I could not hear. Rob Roy had left 
with three men but only one of them had come back.

442
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:50,480
"The man that brought the message is our hostage 
now," Hamish continued. "We can try to exchange  

443
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:58,080
him for our father." Helen asked to see him mid 
they brought forward a man half dead with terror.  

444
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:06,000
Imagine my great surprise-when I recognized 
him - he was my old acquaintance, Mr Morris.

445
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,800
He fell on the ground before Helen MacGregor 
and implored her to spare his life.

446
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,920
"I was totally ignorant of any 
design on the person of Rob Roy,  

447
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,520
a man I honour and love. I was sent by 
Rashleigh with a message for MacGregor,  

448
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:30,640
but I did not know of the plot against him." 
But the woman was not moved by his words.

449
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,960
"Life is a heavy burden for me, for you 
it is enjoyment. This enjoyment must  

450
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,880
end. You shall die, miserable dog!" she said, 
and gave a brief command to her attendants.

451
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:55,520
Two Highlanders came and dragged Morris to a 
cliff over the lake. He struggled and shouted  

452
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:06,960
while they tied a rock around his neck and took 
off some of his clothes. His cries were terrible,  

453
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:15,840
I still remember them. He looked at me and begged 
for my help, and I tried to speak on his behalf,  

454
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,240
but my words were vain.

455
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
They threw him into the cold, deep water.

456
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:32,960
We were horrified. Bailie Jarvie protested, "That 
was a cruel, unnecessary murder!" he declared.

457
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,880
Helen MacGregor pretended not to 
hear, but turned to me and asked,  

458
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,040
"Are you Rashleigh Osbaldistone? I 
heard Morris call you Osbaldistone."

459
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,360
"No, my name is Francis Osbaldistone," I replied.

460
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:57,200
"Do you know this Rashleigh? is he a relative of 
yours?" she continued. I answered that I knew him.

461
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,960
"Then you will go to the garrison 
with a message," she told me.

462
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,480
"If they don't free Rob Roy 
MacGregor in twelve hours,  

463
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,880
we will send back all our 
prisoners cut into pieces."

464
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,840
A few minutes later I left for the 
garrison. The commanding officer  

465
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,360
read the letter I gave him and gave 
me his reply: "Rob Roy must die."

466
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:28,160
He showed no interest whatsoever in the 
prisoners' lives and ordered the cavalry  

467
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:41,840
troops to prepare to leave, escorting Rob Roy 
and the English prisoner - that is to say, me.
 
 

468
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
CHAPTER ELEVEN

469
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,120
Where Is Rob Roy?

470
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,800
We travelled surrounded by armed soldiers.  

471
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:16,640
Rob Roy was on a horse tied with a horse-belt 
to a very big, strong Scotsman called Ewan.  

472
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,680
When we were near the river, Rob Roy 
whispered to Ewan, "It is sad to see  

473
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,360
a Scotsman who considers an English captains 
orders more important than a friend's life."

474
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:39,920
In the middle of the river I heard a splash and 
immediately understood - Rob Roy's words had  

475
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,080
convinced Ewan to free him and give him the 
chance to live. He had jumped off the horse  

476
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,840
into the water! The captain also heard 
the sound and guessed what had happened.

477
00:54:52,560 --> 00:55:00,080
"You dogs!" he cried. "Where is the prisoner? Go 
and look for him! I promise a hundred guineas as a  

478
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,720
reward!" There was great confusion. Some soldiers 
tried to follow the fugitive into the water,  

479
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,440
but the force of the current carried them away.  

480
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,760
Others, who were more cautious, galloped 
along the riverbanks, shooting and shouting.

481
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,080
Escape for Rob Roy was not difficult - he was an  

482
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,880
expert swimmer. At first he 
was confused under the water  

483
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,840
but then he freed himself from his plaid, swam 
away under the surface and was soon out of view.

484
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,200
The soldiers saw the plaid in 
the water and tried to catch it  

485
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:46,240
but they soon gave up. In many places the river 
was inaccessible because of the thick vegetation  

486
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,080
and besides, it was getting dark, so it 
was not easy to see anything in the water.

487
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,640
Most of them believed that Rob would not be able 
to survive the current and the freezing water.  

488
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,520
At last the sound of a 
trumpet announced the retreat.

489
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,400
Up to that moment, I had been a spectator 
- like someone watching a hunting scene at  

490
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,560
Osbaldistone Hall. But suddenly I heard a 
voice call out "Where is the Englishman.  

491
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,520
He gave Rob Roy the knife to 
cut the belt. We must kill him!"

492
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,080
And I realized then the danger of my 
situation. I jumped from my horse and  

493
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,160
ran into a wood where the darkness 
of the night protected my escape.  

494
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,280
I decided I had to try 
somehow to return to Aberfoil.

495
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:48,080
Eventually I found my way back to the road. 
While I was walking, lost in my thoughts,  

496
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,600
a horseman approached me and 
asked me if the road was safe.  

497
00:56:52,800 --> 00:57:00,320
I replied that it was not and then noticed his 
companion. Both of them were wrapped in travelling  

498
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:06,800
cloaks and the hood of the man's cloak hid his 
face, but his companion was not wearing a hood,  

499
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,840
only a small hat, and in the 
dark her figure seemed familiar.  

500
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,880
She addressed me in a familiar voice, 
saying my name. My blood froze in surprise:  

501
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,800
it was Diana Vernon's voice! But the man 
with her prevented any further conversation  

502
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,320
saying in a commanding tone, 
"Give him his property!"

503
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,400
Diana gave me a small case and said,  

504
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,800
"Rashleigh had to abandon your father's papers. 
Here they are. Now, we must part forever.  

505
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:53,840
Farewell, dear Frank." Then she 
galloped away with the unknown man.

506
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:07,840
I was deeply sad, but I continued on my way. 
After a while another voice addressed me.

507
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,640
"Good night, Mr Osbaldistone."

508
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,920
There was no doubt: it was Rob Roy. 
He had escaped his enemies and had  

509
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,480
acquired a musket and other Highland 
weapons since his escape at the river.

510
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,760
I welcomed him, and he asked me about 
the events of the preceding day.  

511
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,000
I told him about the ambush at the 
lake and the meeting with Diana Vernon.  

512
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,240
I was jealous and wanted to know the name of the 
man accompanying her. Did he know? Rob called  

513
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:52,880
him ''His Excellency", but he was so vague that I 
continued to ask myself, is he Diana's husband?"

514
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:01,600
Suddenly three Highlanders appeared in front of 
us on the road and commanded us to stop. Rob said  

515
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:09,440
the word Gregaragh, his name in Gaelic, and they 
cheered us. They were relieved to see that their  

516
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:18,080
chief was safe. We arrived at Aberfoil together 
where we met Jarvie, who was waiting for us.

517
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,240
The following day Rob Roy 
MacGregor accompanied us to  

518
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,520
Loch Lomond, where we could 
take a boat to Glasgow.

519
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:34,480
As we rode he told me, "We Highlanders are rude 
and ignorant, we are also violent and passionate,  

520
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,360
but we are not cruel. We are a persecuted 
generation. We do not want to go against the  

521
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:47,280
laws of the country, but people do not permit 
us to live in peace - so, we must fight."

522
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,000
He then explained that Rashleigh had been 
obliged to give back my father's papers.  

523
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,960
He had gone to Stirling and informed 
the authorities that the Highlanders  

524
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,000
were preparing a rebellion against King George.

525
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:09,760
While he was speaking, Helen and his 
two sons arrived. "You are welcome,"  

526
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:17,360
she said, looking at me and at the Bailie. "Excuse 
my previous rudeness. We live in bad times!"  

527
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:25,520
and she gave me a ring. It was one of Dianas 
rings - a farewell present, Helen said.

528
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:35,280
A boat was waiting for us. We parted from 
Rob Roy with many manifestations of affection  

529
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:41,840
while the bagpipes sounded their melancholy notes.  

530
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,520
He remained watching us for some time, standing 
on a rock at the side of the loch with his long  

531
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:09,840
gun, his tartan and the single feather 
in his cap. Then he vanished.
 
 
 
 

532
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,600
CHAPTER TWELVE

533
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,880
The Tables Are Turned

534
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
That same night we reached Glasgow.  

535
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,600
I returned to my inn, where Andrew 
himself came to open the door.

536
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,320
Owen appeared behind him with 
another man - it was my father!

537
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,440
"My dear, dear son!" he said, embracing me.

538
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,080
We were overjoyed to see one another. 
He told me that he had come to Scotland  

539
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:07,600
to capture Rashleigh and to put 
his affairs in order. My father  

540
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,920
asked Bailie Jarvie to be his firm's correspondent 
in Glasgow and we decided to return to London.

541
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:21,040
On the morning of our departure, Andrew 
Fairservice came to my room like a mad man,  

542
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,800
jumping up and down with excitement and 
told me that the long-awaited rebellion  

543
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:32,160
of the Highlanders in favour of the Old 
Pretender, King James, was beginning.  

544
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,640
Rob Roy and his men were on their way to Glasgow!

545
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,360
In the troubled times that 
followed my Osbaldistone  

546
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:47,840
cousins fought for the Jacobite cause 
and, one after the other, all perished.  

547
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,400
My uncle, Sir Hildebrand, passed away in a 
Hanoverian prison. They say he died of sorrow.

548
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,520
After his death I learned from Judge Inglewood  

549
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,640
that Sir Hildebrand had left all his property 
to me in the event of his sons' deaths.

550
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:13,120
He had cancelled Rashleigh from his will 
because of his support of the Hanoverians,  

551
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:21,760
whom my uncle hated. I was now the heir to 
Osbaldistone Hall - I had inherited everything!  

552
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:29,840
The judge also revealed to me that the man they 
called "His Excellency" was really Diana's father,  

553
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,320
Sir Frederick Vernon. He had lived 
in secret at Osbaldistone Hall  

554
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:42,320
for many years and only Sir Hildebrand, 
Diana and Rashleigh knew his secret.  

555
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:50,720
I was shocked to hear this information but at 
the same time I was pleased. The strange man  

556
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:59,040
Diana often met in the library was her father, 
not her husband - she wasn't married after all!

557
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,640
The next morning I set out for Osbaldistone Hall 
with Andrew. When we arrived, the house had a very  

558
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:15,200
different aspect from the last time I had seen 
it. It was silent and solitary, the doors and  

559
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:22,800
windows were closed, the grass in the courtyards 
was long, the gardens neglected - a sharp contrast  

560
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:30,000
to the lively, bustling atmosphere of some months 
ago. Andrew knocked at every door of the building  

561
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:39,920
and finally my uncle's ancient major-domo, 
appeared. He seemed very agitated and, when  

562
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:47,680
I asked him to light a fire in the library, he 
was reluctant. I soon understood why! As I waited  

563
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:56,240
there, I heard a deep sigh behind me and turned to 
see Diana Vernon standing there with her father.  

564
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,760
"We beg you to help us, Mr Osbaldistone," 
Sir Frederick said. "To give us refuge.  

565
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,520
I am a convinced Catholic, I took part 
in the rebellion in favour of King James,  

566
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,960
but I was obliged to flee.

567
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,640
I am hiding here at Osbaldistone 
Hall with my daughter,  

568
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,760
waiting for a boat to take us to the Continent."

569
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:26,160
I invited them to remain for as long as they 
needed but I was very agitated. That night  

570
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:35,200
there was a violent knocking at the gate - there 
were soldiers outside. They demanded to enter.

571
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,960
They had orders to arrest Sir 
Vernon on a charge of treason.

572
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:47,040
Diana appeared beside me. She whispered "Danger 
is familiar to us, Frank. Don't be afraid.  

573
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:57,280
We will escape into the garden and then into the 
wood. Dear, dear Frank, farewell!" I heard Andrew  

574
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:04,160
shouting. With the soldiers there was a magistrate 
with a legal mandate accompanied by - Rashleigh!  

575
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:10,720
They went at once to the library but it was 
already empty - Diana and her father had fled.  

576
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:20,320
They ran into the gardens and caught the fugitives 
at the gate. It seemed all was lost but then, as  

577
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:25,600
the escort party was leaving with their prisoners, 
they found a barricade at the Hall gates.

578
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,640
A group of Highlanders barred the way with their 
cattle. Rashleigh's men were trying to drive the  

579
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:39,200
cattle away, when suddenly the leader of the 
Highlanders cried "Claymore!" It was an ambush  

580
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:46,480
prepared by Rob Roy! There was a desperate fight. 
The soldiers fled and Rashleigh was badly wounded.

581
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:52,720
"Ask pardon for your treason in the name 
of God, King James and our old friendship,"  

582
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,840
cried Rob Roy, his sword at Rashleigh's throat.

583
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,840
"Never!" replied Rashleigh, firmly.

584
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:07,840
"Then, traitor, die for your treason!" cried Rob 
and passed his sword through his enemy's body.  

585
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:15,440
He was still breathing when we brought him to the 
Hall. His last words were for me: "The pangs of  

586
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:24,320
death do not alter my feelings towards you, Frank 
Osbaldistone - I hate you with an immense hatred!"

587
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,840
And then he died.

588
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,720
Diana and her father escaped and took the 
boat to France. I returned to London to  

589
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:44,720
work in my fathers company. After some time, my 
anxiety to learn the fate of Miss Vernon became  

590
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:54,240
acute and I embarked for France. There, after 
many adventures, I found her and married her.  

591
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:09,840
We have lived happily 
together since that day.
 
 
 
 

592
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,360
-  

593
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,714
THE END -
