CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,240
The Minstrel

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,160
One cold winter evening King Arthur and his  

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,960
knights were sitting at the Round 
Table in the castle of Camelot.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,840
Suddenly a tall young man 
came into the great hall.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,280
He had dark hair and dark, sad eyes.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,840
His clothes were old but clean.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,960
He had a harp under his arm.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,720
'Welcome to Camelot, young man,' said King Arthur.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,600
'Are you a minstrel?'

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,920
'Yes, your majesty, I am,' said the young man.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,600
'Where are you from?' asked King Arthur.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,680
'I'm from Cornwall,' answered the minstrel.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,240
'Well,' said King Arthur, 'we 
like minstrels and their stories.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,880
Tell us a good story about brave 
knights and lovely ladies.'

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,000
'Do you know the story of Sir Tristan 
of Lyonesse?' asked one of the knights.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
'Yes, I do,' answered the minstrel.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,120
'Sir Tristan is a brave knight, 
but his story is very sad.'

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,600
'Sit down and tell us,' said King Arthur.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,560
Everyone in the hall was interested in 
the story of Sir Tristan of Lyonesse.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,200
The minstrel sat on a stool and started 
telling his story to the king and his knights.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Sometimes he spoke and sometimes 
he sang and played his harp.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,080
This is the story he told:

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,520
For many years there were wars 
between Cornwall and Ireland.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,600
The Irish often sailed across the 
sea to Cornwall and attacked it.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,840
There were terrible battles and many people died.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,360
King Mark of Cornwall wanted 
peace but the Irish did not.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,600
He didn't know what to do.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,720
One day he asked his cousin King 
Rivalin of Lyonesse for help.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,720
'Help me fight the Irish and you can marry my 
beautiful sister,' said King Mark to his cousin.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,920
'The Irish are my enemies too,' said King Rivalin.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
'I'll help you fight them.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,760
Together we can win, and I'll 
marry your beautiful sister.'

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,800
King Rivalin and King Mark fought together 
and won the war against the Irish.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,160
King Rivalin married King Mark's sister and 
they returned to his castle in Lyonesse.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,120
They loved each other and 
were very happy together.

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,800
But their happiness did not continue for long.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,320
A year later King Rivalin was killed in battle.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,800
At the same time the queen had 
a son, but she died soon after.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
Before dying she called her servant, Rual.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,000
'Rual, I'm dying,' said 
the young, beautiful queen.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
'Take my child and call him Tristan.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
His name means sadness.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
It comes from the French word "triste".

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
Look after him and love him like a son.

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
And when he is a man he must go and 
meet my brother, King Mark of Cornwall.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,760
He will help him.'

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Rual and his wife loved little 
Tristan and they looked after him.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,800
He became a strong, brave boy.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
He learned to use a sword, a 
spear, and to ride a horse.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,320
He also learned to play the 
harp and speak other languages.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,600
When Tristan became a man he left Lyonesse and 
went to Cornwall to meet his uncle, King Mark.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,440
The king lived in a big castle in Tintagel.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,560
Tristan entered the great hall of the 
castle and saw his uncle for the first time.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,920
'Your majesty, I'm your 
nephew Tristan from Lyonesse.'

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
'My nephew, Tristan - my sister's son!'

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,240
said King Mark, looking at the tall young man.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,280
'Welcome to Tintagel! This is your new home.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm very happy you're here.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,160
My knights and I will teach you many 
things and you'll become a great knight.'

61
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,440
Everyone welcomed Tristan to the castle.

62
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,680
He was happy with his uncle, 
who loved him like a son.

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,120
He became a famous knight 
and fought in many battles.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,720
The people of Cornwall knew about 
his great courage and liked him.

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,440
But some of the knights and nobles were jealous of 
him because he was King Mark's favourite knight.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,680
One day Sir Morholt from 
Ireland came to Tintagel Castle.

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,920
He was a gigantic man with a 
dark face and strong hands.

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,760
'King Gurman of Ireland sent me 
here,' he said in a loud voice.

69
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,400
'He wants a tribute from you, King Mark.'

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,240
'A tribute?' said King Mark, surprised.

71
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
'Yes, a tribute!'

72
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,760
said Sir Morholt.

73
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,880
'If you send a tribute, King 
Gurman won't attack Cornwall.'

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,200
'What is the tribute?' asked King Mark.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,360
'You must send him thirty noble 
boys who will become his servants.'

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,080
'What!'

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,720
cried King Mark.

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,160
'Thirty of our noble boys! This is terrible!'

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,720
'You must do what King Gurman wants,' said Sir 
Morholt, 'or one of your knights can fight me.

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,960
If your knight wins you don't have 
to send the tribute to the king.

81
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,440
But no one will fight me! I'm the strongest 
knight in the world and everyone's afraid of me.'

82
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,040
Everyone was silent, but 
Tristan's face was red with anger.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,080
'I will fight you, Sir Morholt!'

84
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,320
said Tristan.

85
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,600
'I'm not afraid of you!'

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,680
Everyone was surprised and looked at Tristan.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,880
'No, Tristan, don't fight him - he's 
too big and strong,' said King Mark.

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,000
'You can't win! He'll kill you.'

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,440
'No, Uncle Mark,' said Tristan, 'I'm a 
knight of Cornwall and I must fight him.'

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,920
Sir Morholt looked at the young man 
in front of him and started laughing.

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,280
Tristan was much shorter and 
thinner than the Irish giant.

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,160
'I'll meet you in a week on the small island 
opposite the castle,' said Sir Morholt.

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,200
'Come alone, early in the morning!'

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
'I'll be there!'

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:46,440
said Tristan, looking at Sir Morholt's 
cold eyes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,200
CHAPTER TWO

97
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Sir Morholt

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,600
A week later Sir Morholt came to 
the island early in the morning.

99
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
He pulled his boat onto the beach.

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,640
Then Tristan came to the island 
but he pushed his boat away.

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,800
'Why did you push your boat 
away?' asked Sir Morholt.

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
'You'll need it when you 
decide to run away from me.'

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,640
Tristan looked at him bravely and said, 'I 
won't run away because I'm not afraid of you.

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,760
Remember, only one man will 
leave this island alive!'

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,040
Sir Morholt laughed and raised his big sword.

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,520
Tristan did the same and they started fighting.

107
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,080
Tristan was young and light and he moved quickly.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,760
Sir Morholt was slow and 
heavy, but he was very strong.

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,800
Tristan jumped here and there, 
and soon Sir Morholt was tired.

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,200
But he continued fighting.

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,320
The fight went on for many hours.

112
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,480
Suddenly Sir Morholt wounded 
Tristan's leg with his big sword.

113
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,840
'There's poison on my sword,' 
said Sir Morholt, laughing.

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,760
'If you don't find someone to cure 
your wound you'll be very ill.

115
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,080
And only a few people in the world can cure it.'

116
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Tristan was very angry and raised his heavy sword.

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,400
He cut through Sir Morholt's 
helmet and wounded his head.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,600
A small piece of Tristan's sword broke 
and remained in Sir Morholt's head.

119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,120
The Irish giant fell to the 
ground - he was almost dead.

120
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,760
That evening some of Sir 
Morholt's men came to the island.

121
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,960
They were surprised to see 
him on the ground, wounded.

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,200
They put him on their boat and sailed 
back to Ireland, where he died.

123
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,760
His sister was the Queen of Ireland, and she 
was very sad because she loved her brother.

124
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,880
She took the small piece of sword from Sir  

125
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,840
Morholt's head and put it in 
a small blue box in her room.

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,920
'One day I'll find the man who 
killed my brother,' she thought.

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,040
Tristan returned to Tintagel Castle 
but his wound made him very ill.

128
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,520
King Mark called the best doctors of 
Cornwall but they could not help him.

129
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,640
'Tristan must go to Ireland to cure 
his wound,' said an old doctor,  

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
'because the poison comes from there.

131
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,200
The Queen of Ireland knows 
everything about poisons and herbs.

132
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,920
She can help him.'

133
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,840
'Then Tristan must go to Ireland 
immediately,' said King Mark.

134
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,400
'Get a ship ready!'

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:53,200
Tristan went to Ireland dressed as a 
minstrel and called himself Tantris.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,640
He did not want anyone to 
know that he was Sir Tristan.

137
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,600
He played the harp and sang beautifully, 
and the Irish liked his songs.

138
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,240
One day King Gurman heard about the 
minstrel and called him to his castle.

139
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,600
King Gurman and his Queen had only one 
child - a lovely daughter called Isolde.

140
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:26,720
She was the most beautiful girl in the world, with 
long blonde hair, blue eyes and a lovely smile.

141
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,760
Everyone talked about her beauty.

142
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,080
The King wanted Isolde to play the harp, 
but there were no good teachers in Ireland.

143
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,640
Tantris entered the great hall 
of the castle with his harp.

144
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,360
He walked slowly because his leg hurt.

145
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,280
'Are you the famous minstrel 
Tantris?' asked King Gurman.

146
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,840
'Yes, I'm the minstrel,' said Tristan.

147
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,160
'What's wrong with your leg?' asked the King.

148
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
'I wounded it during a 
terrible battle,' said Tristan.

149
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,400
'People say you play the harp 
beautifully,' said King Gurman.

150
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,040
'Play something for me.'

151
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,520
Tristan played the harp and sang a 
lovely song, and the king was pleased.

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,000
'Can you teach my daughter Isolde 
to play the harp?' asked the King.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,080
'Of course I can,' said Tristan happily.

154
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,920
'Very well,' said the King.

155
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,320
'The Queen will cure your 
wound with her special herbs.

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
And you will teach Isolde to play the harp.

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
You can live here at the castle.'

158
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,960
'Thank you, your majesty,' said Tristan, smiling.

159
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,880
'I'm glad everyone thinks I'm 
a minstrel,' thought Tristan.

160
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,960
'Now my leg will get better and 
I'll soon go back to Cornwall.'

161
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,240
Tristan's leg slowly got better.

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,440
Every morning he taught Isolde 
to play the harp and sing.

163
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,360
Isolde learned quickly and 
the King was very happy.

164
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:14,760
During the harp lessons Tristan often thought, 
'Isolde is very beautiful!'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

165
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
CHAPTER THREE

166
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,680
The Dragon

167
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,760
Tristan stayed in Ireland at King Gurman's castle 
and taught Isolde to play the harp and sing.

168
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,440
He and Isolde became good friends and 
often laughed and talked together.

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,000
Isolde became a good singer and harp player.

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,600
She played the harp and sang songs 
for her parents and other nobles.

171
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,400
After a year Tristan returned to Cornwall.

172
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,560
King Mark was very happy to see his nephew.

173
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,000
Every day Tristan told his uncle 
about Isolde's great beauty.

174
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,320
'Isolde is the most beautiful girl in 
the world, and she is gentle and kind.

175
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,840
Her hair is the colour of gold and 
her eyes are the colour of the sea.

176
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,400
She plays the harp well and 
sings with a sweet voice.'

177
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,600
King Mark listened to Tristan and said,  

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,880
'Isolde is King Gurman's only daughter 
and she is beautiful and kind.

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,600
If I marry her there will be 
peace between our two countries.'

180
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,880
The king's knights and nobles agreed 
with him, but there was one problem.

181
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,840
'We agree with you,' said one noble, 
'but how can you marry Princess Isolde?  

182
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,400
The king and queen of Ireland hate us 
because Sir Morholt was killed here.'

183
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,840
'He's right,' said another noble.

184
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:58,000
King Mark was silent for a moment and 
then said, 'I want to marry Isolde.

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,160
I'll have the most beautiful wife in the world 
and there will be peace between our countries.

186
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,480
We must find a way!'

187
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,080
He looked at Tristan but he didn't say anything.

188
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,880
Tristan knew what his uncle wanted.

189
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,200
'Uncle Mark,' said Tristan, 'I 
know this is a dangerous adventure.

190
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,240
When the Queen of Ireland discovers 
who I am, she'll be very angry.

191
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
She hates the knight who 
killed her brother Morholt.

192
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
But I'm not afraid.

193
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll bring Isolde to you, Uncle 
Mark, and you can marry her.'

194
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,240
'You're brave and loyal, Tristan,' said King Mark.

195
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,280
'Be very careful.'

196
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,080
Tristan sailed to Ireland on 
a small ship with thirty men.

197
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,080
They arrived in Ireland on a stormy night.

198
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,720
'I must think of a plan,' thought Tristan.

199
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,080
'I must bring Isolde to King Mark.'

200
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,280
At that time a terrible green 
dragon lived in Ireland.

201
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,080
It killed a lot of people and burned 
houses and trees with its fire.

202
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,400
No one could kill it.

203
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,360
King Gurman was worried 
and didn't know what to do.

204
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,920
One day he said to his nobles, 'The man who kills  

205
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:32,000
the terrible green dragon will 
marry my lovely daughter Isolde!'

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,680
Everyone in Ireland was talking about 
this, and Tristan heard about it too.

207
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,960
He was excited because he 
wanted to kill the dragon.

208
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,720
He had a heavy sword, a 
long lance and a big shield.

209
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,640
He rode to the valley of the dragon and saw the 
dead bodies of other knights who tried to kill it.

210
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,120
Suddenly Tristan saw the angry dragon.

211
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:06,640
It was a terrible green monster with long 
white teeth, angry red eyes and a long tail.

212
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,160
Fire and smoke came out of its mouth.

213
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,280
'What an ugly creature!'

214
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
thought Tristan.

215
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,480
He attacked the dragon with his lance and sword.

216
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,880
They fought for more than an hour, and in the 
end Tristan killed it with his long lance.

217
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,920
The dragon's last breath was hot and poisonous.

218
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,840
Tristan soon felt very bad.

219
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,320
He went to the dead dragon 
and opened its big mouth,  

220
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,720
Then he cut out its tongue and put it in his bag.

221
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,600
'This tongue will show that I 
killed the dragon,' he thought.

222
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,360
The poison made him ill and he fell to the ground.

223
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,840
Later that day one of the king's nobles called 
Seneschal came to the valley of the dragon.

224
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,440
He liked Isolde very much 
and he wanted to marry her.

225
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,120
But he was a coward and was afraid of the dragon.

226
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:14,600
When Seneschal saw the dead dragon he 
thought, 'This is wonderful - someone  

227
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,080
already killed the dragon! I can tell 
the King I killed it and then I can  

228
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:28,200
marry Isolde! But first I must cut off 
the dead dragon's head to show the King.'

229
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,120
He cut off the head and took it to the King.

230
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,920
'Your majesty,' he said, 'I killed the 
green dragon! Look, here is its head.

231
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Now I can marry your daughter, Princess Isolde.'

232
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,640
The King knew Seneschal was a 
coward and he did not believe him.

233
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
But the head of the dragon was in front of him.

234
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,160
When Isolde heard this she 
started crying and could not stop.

235
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,040
'What's wrong, Isolde?' asked the Queen.

236
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,680
'Oh, mother,' said Isolde crying, 'I don't 
like Seneschal and I don't want to marry him!'

237
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,840
'Don't cry, my dear,' said the Queen.

238
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,360
'I don't believe Seneschal killed the dragon.

239
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Come with me quickly.'

240
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,600
That evening they went to the valley and found 
the dead dragon and Tristan on the ground.

241
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,360
'Look!'

242
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,640
cried Isolde.

243
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,440
'It's Tantris the minstrel.

244
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,880
But he's dressed like a knight.

245
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,760
I don't understand.'

246
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,920
Tristan heard Isolde's sweet 
voice and slowly moved his head.

247
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,960
'Are you Tantris?' asked the Queen.

248
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
He opened his eyes and said, 'Yes, I am.'

249
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,480
'Why are you in Ireland?' asked the Queen.

250
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,360
'I came to Ireland with some merchants,' he said.

251
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,160
'Did you kill the dragon?' asked the Queen.

252
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:02,280
'I knew there was a terrible dragon in your 
country and I decided to kill it,' said Tristan.

253
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
The Queen listened and smiled.

254
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
'Tantris, you did a great 
thing and helped our country.

255
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,040
The King will be very pleased.

256
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,440
But you aren't well because 
the dragon poisoned you.

257
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:24,080
Come with us to the castle and I'll cure 
you again with my herbs.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

258
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,520
CHAPTER FOUR

259
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Seneschal

260
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Once again the Irish Queen cured Tristan 
with her magic herbs and Isolde helped her.

261
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,400
After a week he got better and went 
to the great hall to see King Gurman.

262
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,200
There was a big dinner in honour of 
Seneschal, who wanted to marry Isolde.

263
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:55,360
King Gurman, the Queen, Isolde, knights, nobles 
and their ladies were sitting at a long table.

264
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,720
Seneschal talked to his friends and told 
them about his fight with the dragon.

265
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,680
'It was a long, terrible fight,' he 
said loudly, 'but I was never afraid.

266
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,840
I got very near to the green 
monster and looked at his red eyes.

267
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,920
I saw his long, white teeth and 
felt his hot breath in my face.

268
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,240
I knew I had to kill him, and in the 
end I did! Then I cut his head off.'

269
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,640
The King was silent but the Queen was not.

270
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,640
She looked at Seneschal and said, 
'You didn't kill the dragon.

271
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,440
You found the dead dragon and cut his head off!'

272
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,160
'What!'

273
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,960
said Seneschal, angrily.

274
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,480
'I killed the dragon with my lance after a long 
fight,' said Tristan, getting up from his chair.

275
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,320
'You're a liar and a coward!'

276
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,560
Seneschal got up from his chair and 
said, 'Everyone knows I'm a brave man.

277
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
I brought the King the head of the dragon.'

278
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,200
'Look in the dragon's mouth,' said the Queen.

279
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,120
Seneschal opened the dragon's mouth 
and cried, 'The tongue's gone!'

280
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,800
'Yes,' said Tristan.

281
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,360
Everyone was surprised and looked at Tristan.

282
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,940
He opened his bag and pulled 
out the dragon's tongue.

283
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,840
'Oh!'

284
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,160
everyone said when they saw the long green tongue.

285
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,400
'Liar! Coward!'

286
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,040
everyone shouted at Seneschal.

287
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,600
'No,' cried Seneschal angrily, 'you're 
a liar and a thief! I killed the dragon  

288
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,840
and you took its tongue! Fight me in battle 
and we'll see who marries Princess Isolde!'

289
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,760
'Very well,' said Tristan, 'I'll 
fight you, Seneschal, and I'll win!'

290
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,600
'Very well, there will be a tournament in three 
days,' said King Gurman, 'and everyone is invited.

291
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,400
The winner will marry my daughter, Isolde.'

292
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,040
Everyone started talking about the tournament and 
there was a lot of excitement in the great hall.

293
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,560
'Who do you think will win?' asked one noble.

294
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,480
'I don't know, but they're both young 
and strong,' answered his friend.

295
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,840
'It will be a great fight,' said a young knight.

296
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,640
'And the winner will have a 
beautiful prize: Princess Isolde!'

297
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,360
said a noble lady.

298
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,640
On the morning of the tournament 
Tristan went to prepare his horse.

299
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,760
Isolde brought some of the Queen's herbs 
to Tristan's room, but he wasn't there.

300
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,520
His big sword was on the 
table and she looked at it.

301
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:55,000
'How strange,' she thought, 'a small 
piece of the sword is missing.'

302
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,920
She immediately thought of the blue box with the  

303
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,680
small piece of sword from 
her uncle Morholt's head.

304
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,560
'Oh no,' she thought, 'is this 
the sword that killed my uncle?'  

305
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,000
She ran to her mother's room and got the blue box.

306
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
She opened it slowly and saw 
the small piece of sword inside.

307
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,120
Then she looked at Tristan's sword and said,  

308
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,960
'The piece comes from the same 
sword! I must tell my mother.'

309
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,440
She went to her mother and said, 
'Come with me to Tantris's room.'

310
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,280
When they got there she said, 
'The minstrel Tantris is not a  

311
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:42,240
minstrel! He's Sir Tristan of Lyonesse, who 
killed uncle Morholt! Look at his sword.'

312
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,480
She showed her mother Tristan's sword 
and the small piece in the blue box.

313
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,320
'You're right, Isolde!'

314
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
said the Queen, surprised.

315
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,240
'This is the sword that killed Morholt.'

316
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,920
Isolde's face was red with anger.

317
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,120
'Now I'm going to kill Tristan with this sword!'

318
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,680
'No, Isolde!'

319
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,400
cried the Queen.

320
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,600
'What are you saying? Tristan fought 
against Morholt in a fair battle.

321
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,400
He's a brave knight and a good man.

322
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Let's talk to him.'

323
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,440
When Tristan returned to his room the Queen and 
Isolde confronted him, and he told them the truth.

324
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,400
'Yes, I'm Sir Tristan of Lyonesse.

325
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,120
My uncle is King Mark of Cornwall, 
a rich and important king.

326
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,120
He sent me here because he wants to marry 
Isolde and bring peace to our countries.'

327
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:44,240
The Queen listened to Tristan and said, 'You came 
to Ireland for a good reason - we want peace too.

328
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
A marriage between our families is a good idea.'

329
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
'But mother!'

330
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,400
said Isolde.

331
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
'Tristan killed my uncle Morholt!'

332
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,240
'Morholt was my brother, and I loved 
him very much,' said the Queen.

333
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,880
'But we must forget the bad things of the 
past and build a future for our countries.'

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,640
'You're a good Queen,' said Tristan.

335
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,680
Isolde was silent.

336
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,520
Then the Queen looked at her daughter and smiled.

337
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,680
'My dear Isolde, King Mark is a great king and 
you'll be his queen - the Queen of Cornwall.

338
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,800
You'll be happy with him.'

339
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,760
'But he's much older than I am,' said Isolde.

340
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,320
'King Mark isn't an old man,' said Tristan.

341
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,760
'He's tall and good-looking, and 
he's not a coward like Seneschal.

342
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,400
He's a brave man.'

343
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
'Did you hear that, Isolde?' asked the Queen.

344
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,440
Isolde looked at her mother and 
asked, 'Will I love him, mother?'

345
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,120
'Yes, Isolde, you'll love him,' she 
answered quietly and looked away.

346
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,880
Isolde smiled.

347
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,920
'But now Tristan must win the 
tournament,' said the Queen.

348
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,160
'If he doesn't, you must marry Seneschal.'

349
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,040
'I'll fight and win!'

350
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280
said Tristan.

351
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,840
'Please win, Tristan!'

352
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,040
said Isolde.

353
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:15,520
'I don't want to marry Seneschal - he's 
a coward and a liar.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

354
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,280
CHAPTER FIVE

355
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,680
The Green Bottle

356
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,600
The tournament started early in the afternoon, 
and hundreds of people were there to watch it.

357
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,680
King Gurman, the Queen and 
Isolde sat in the first seats.

358
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,440
Isolde was very anxious.

359
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,720
Both men wore heavy armour.

360
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,840
Seneschal rode a black horse 
and Tristan rode a white one.

361
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
Senescal fought bravely because 
he wanted to marry Isolde so much,  

362
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,880
but in the end Tristan killed Senescal.

363
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
He was the winner.

364
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,600
'Hurrah for Sir Tristan!'

365
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,480
cheered the people.

366
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,240
'Hurrah!'

367
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,720
Now Tristan could take Isolde 
to his uncle, King Mark.

368
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,680
The Queen loved Isolde and wanted 
her to be happy with King Mark.

369
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,400
'Isolde must fall in love with King 
Mark,' she thought, 'then she'll be happy.

370
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,240
I must prepare the best love 
potion in the world for them.

371
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,400
When they drink this love potion 
they will always love each other.'

372
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,440
She quickly went to her herb garden and 
took the magic herbs for the love potion.

373
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,560
Then she went to her secret room 
in the castle and made the potion.

374
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,240
When it was ready she called Lady 
Bragnae, who was Isolde's maid and friend.

375
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,640
'Listen carefully, Lady Bragnae,' said the Queen.

376
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,240
'You'll go with Isolde to Cornwall.

377
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,680
The ship leaves tomorrow.'

378
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,360
'Yes, my Queen,' said Lady Bragnae, 
'I'm happy to go with Isolde.'

379
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,640
'On the day of her marriage you must give this  

380
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,400
green bottle to Isolde and 
King Mark,' said the Queen.

381
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,640
'Tell them to drink this excellent 
wine - a good luck present from me.

382
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,360
Remember, Bragnae, they both must drink it.

383
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,880
This is the strongest love potion in the world.

384
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,320
When they drink it they 
will always love each other.

385
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,480
Their love will be the greatest in 
the world and it will never die.

386
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,920
Do you understand?'

387
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,120
'Yes, I do,' said Lady Bragnae.

388
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,480
She left the Queen's room with 
the green bottle in her hands.

389
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,560
The next day Tristan's ship 
left Ireland for Cornwall.

390
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,440
The sea voyage took many days.

391
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,160
There was stormy weather at sea and 
Isolde sat in her cabin all day.

392
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,600
Sometimes she was sad because she 
thought about her mother and father.

393
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,480
Tristan often visited her and 
told her stories of old Cornwall.

394
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,040
He also told her the story of King Arthur 
and the Knights of the Round Table.

395
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,280
Isolde liked listening to his stories.

396
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,080
During the stormy weather Lady Bragnae was 
often ill and stayed in bed in her cabin.

397
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,280
One evening Tristan and Isolde played 
the harp and sang together all evening.

398
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Tristan was thirsty.

399
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,760
'Do you have anything to drink in the cabin?'

400
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,000
'Lady Bragnae brought a bottle of wine,' said 
Isolde, pointing to a green bottle on a shelf.

401
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,040
'Would you like some?'

402
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
'Hmm...

403
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,560
yes, I would,' said Tristan.

404
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,040
Isolde took two gold cups and 
they drank the wine together.

405
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,360
They did not know that it 
was the Queen's love potion!

406
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
The green bottle was soon empty.

407
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,880
Tristan and Isolde talked and laughed together, 
but something strange was happening to them.

408
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,040
They started looking into each 
other's eyes and feeling strange.

409
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,200
What was this new feeling? They were in love!

410
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,800
That evening the sea became calm 
and Bragnae soon felt better.

411
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,280
She went to find Isolde and immediately 
saw the empty bottle and the two gold cups.

412
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,160
But Bragnae had a cold heart and did 
not say anything to Tristan and Isolde.

413
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,640
'This is terrible!'

414
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
she thought.

415
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,960
'They both drank the potion and 
they will be unhappy lovers until  

416
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,840
they die! But they must never know the truth.

417
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,680
Oh, why did this happen?'

418
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:46,280
That night when Isolde was sleeping Bragnae took 
the empty green bottle and threw it into the sea.

419
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,160
The next morning Tristan went 
to visit Isolde in her cabin.

420
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,920
'Isolde,' said Tristan, 'something strange 
happened to me last night and now...

421
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm in love with you!'

422
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:08,480
'Oh, Tristan, 'said Isolde, smiling, 'the same 
thing happened to me - I'm in love with you too.'

423
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,920
They looked at each other and embraced and kissed.

424
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,320
'Our love is impossible, Tristan 
- I must marry King Mark.'

425
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,680
'Yes, I know,' said Tristan sadly.

426
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,360
'King Mark is my uncle and 
I love him like a father.

427
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,200
But I love you more than anyone or 
anything in the world, my sweet Isolde.'

428
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,400
'We must enjoy these few wonderful 
days at sea together,' said Isolde.

429
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,120
'These are the only days we have,' said Tristan.

430
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,480
'When we get to Cornwall our 
happiness will end, but not our love.'

431
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,160
'No, our love will never end,' 
said Isolde, touching his hand.

432
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,840
'Never ever.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

433
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,080
CHAPTER SIX

434
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,880
Queen Isolde of Cornwall

435
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,440
Tristan's ship arrived in Cornwall at Tintagel,  

436
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,960
and before getting off Tristan and 
Isolde said goodbye to each other.

437
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,320
'You'll always be my only love, 
sweet Isolde,' said Tristan.

438
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,200
'My heart will always be yours.'

439
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,760
'And you'll always be the only person 
in my heart, Tristan,' said Isolde.

440
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,000
They embraced for the last time.

441
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,280
When King Mark met Isolde he was amazed 
by her beauty and her sweet voice.

442
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,880
He loved her immediately.

443
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,840
She became King Mark's wife 
and the Queen of Cornwall.

444
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,720
There was a great celebration with 
music and dancing that lasted many days.

445
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
The people of Cornwall liked their new queen.

446
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:06,680
King Mark was very happy with Isolde but 
she was not, because she loved only Tristan.

447
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,800
A year later, in the spring, 
Isolde decided to go hunting  

448
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,640
in the forest with Lady Bragnae and other nobles.

449
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,440
King Mark called Tristan and said,  

450
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,560
'Isolde and Lady Bragnae want to 
go hunting in the forest today.

451
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,560
I don't want them to go 
alone because it's dangerous.

452
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,600
Go with them, and look after them.

453
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,520
I trust only you, Tristan.'

454
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,000
Tristan's heart jumped when 
he heard Isolde's name.

455
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,360
'Very well, uncle Mark,' he said.

456
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,080
'I'll go hunting with them.'

457
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,440
During the hunt Lady Bragnae and the 
others took different paths in the forest.

458
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,040
Soon Isolde and Tristan were alone.

459
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,920
They stopped near a small river.

460
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
They were still in love.

461
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,000
'I'm happy we're alone, dear 
Isolde,' said Tristan quietly.

462
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,280
'I am too, Tristan,' said Isolde, 
looking into Tristan's eyes.

463
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
'But our love's wrong...'

464
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,560
'I know, it's wrong and impossible,' said Tristan,  

465
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,200
'but you're in my heart 
and you'll always be there.

466
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,880
My love for you is stronger 
than my loyalty to the King...'

467
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:32,960
Isolde could not speak - they embraced 
and stayed near the river until sunset.

468
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,200
After that day they met at the 
river in the forest many times.

469
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,560
One day some of King Mark's nobles saw them.

470
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,600
They were jealous of Tristan because 
he was the best knight in Cornwall.

471
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,640
They decided to tell King Mark.

472
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,560
'Don't trust Sir Tristan and 
Queen Isolde,' said one noble.

473
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,520
'I saw them sitting together 
at the river in the forest.'

474
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:07,240
'My nephew and my wife are good friends 
and nothing more,' said King Mark angrily.

475
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,520
'I trust them both!'

476
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,040
'They are more than good friends, 
King Mark,' said another noble.

477
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,520
'Don't say these bad things 
about my wife and my nephew!'

478
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,680
cried King Mark angrily.

479
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:29,000
Tristan and Isolde continued seeing each other 
in the forest and one day Sir Melot saw them.

480
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,560
He was a bad man and hated Tristan.

481
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,280
He immediately went to tell King Mark.

482
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,000
'I saw Sir Tristan and Queen Isolde 
together again in the forest,' he said.

483
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,760
'I don't believe you!'

484
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,080
said King Mark.

485
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,200
'You're a liar.'

486
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,240
'Then come with me quickly and 
you'll see them too,' he said.

487
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,880
King Mark got on his horse and 
followed Sir Melot to the forest.

488
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,080
They hid behind some trees and saw Tristan 
and Isolde sitting near the stream.

489
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,040
Tristan was touching Isolde's long blonde hair.

490
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
Now King Mark believed Sir 
Melot and he was very angry.

491
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,720
That evening he called all of his 
nobles and explained everything to them.

492
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,080
'Sir Tristan is a traitor!'

493
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,160
cried King Mark.

494
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,600
'I loved him like a son and 
taught him everything he knows.

495
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:40,320
I trusted him and I trusted Queen 
Isolde - but now he must die!'

496
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
King Mark had tears in his eyes.

497
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,160
'No,' said the oldest noble.

498
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,320
'We don't like Sir Tristan 
but he is a brave knight.

499
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,400
We may need him for future battles.

500
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:02,600
He's the best knight we have, and the people 
of Cornwall love him - he's their hero.

501
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,080
If you kill him the people will be angry.

502
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:13,360
Send him away, and if we need him 
for future battles we'll call him.'

503
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,120
'You're right,' said King Mark.

504
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,000
'He must leave Cornwall immediately and never see  

505
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,680
Isolde again! The Queen is young 
and she'll forget Tristan soon.'

506
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,560
King Mark sent Tristan away from 
Cornwall and Isolde was very sad.

507
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,320
She stayed in her room and cried 
because she could not forget Tristan.

508
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,960
Tristan left Cornwall and he was very unhappy.

509
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,880
He did not want to be a knight any 
more because he did not have a king.

510
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,600
Now he was alone in the world.

511
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,640
He decided to became a minstrel 
and went from village to village.

512
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,020
He played the harp and sang the 
story of his love for Isolde.

513
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,840
***

514
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,800
This was the end of the minstrel's story.

515
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,920
He stopped singing and playing, and suddenly there  

516
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:16,680
was silence in the great hall of King 
Arthur's castle.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

517
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,360
CHAPTER SEVEN

518
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,000
Sir Tristan of Lyonesse

519
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,520
King Arthur looked at him and said, 'Minstrel, 
why do you know the story of Tristan and Isolde?

520
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,680
The minstrel got up from his stool and 
said, 'Because I am Tristan of Lyonesse!'

521
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,440
Everyone in the great hail was very surprised.

522
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,000
King Arthur stood up and said, 'Welcome to 
Camelot, Sir Tristan, and welcome to the  

523
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,880
Round Table! Many years ago Merlin the magician 
said, "One day Sir Tristan will be a knight of  

524
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:05,040
the Round Table." He was right! Look, there's 
a seat with your name, next to Sir Lancelot.

525
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,520
Sit down, Sir Tristan! Today's 
an important day for us because  

526
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,800
we have another brave knight at the Round Table.'

527
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,800
'This is a great honour for 
me,' said Tristan, sitting down.

528
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,480
'Thank you, King Arthur.'

529
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,320
The other knights cheered and welcomed him.

530
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,480
Sir Tristan became an important 
knight of the Round Table,  

531
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,240
and the other knights liked him 
because he was brave, kind and loyal.

532
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,880
Only the bravest knights 
could sit at the Round Table.

533
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,880
He fought for King Arthur in many wars and 
battles, and had many adventures in the kingdom.

534
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,440
But he was always sad because 
he could not forget Isolde.

535
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,000
He thought about her all the time, day and night.

536
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,440
The years passed and one day 
he went to Brittany in France,  

537
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,080
where he met the daughter of the Duke of Arundel.

538
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,560
Her name was Isolde too - 
Isolde of the White Hands.

539
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,840
She was a pretty, young 
girl and Tristan liked her.

540
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,520
'Why do I like Isolde of the 
White Hands?' he thought.

541
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:27,320
'Do I like her smile or her voice? Do I like 
her lovely white hands or do I like her name?  

542
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,520
Do I love her?'

543
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,800
Tristan could not answer these 
questions, but he decided to marry her.

544
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:44,360
Isolde of the White Hands was a good, loving 
wife and Tristan was a kind, loyal husband.

545
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,520
But he was not happy because he 
could not forget Queen Isolde.

546
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,680
She was his first and only love.

547
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,240
Isolde of the White Hands 
knew this and she was jealous.

548
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,840
'Why can't Tristan love me like 
he loves her?' she thought.

549
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,480
One day Tristan fought in a battle 
to help his wife's brother, Kahedin.

550
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,720
It was a long, terrible battle and 
Tristan was wounded with a poisoned spear.

551
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,400
His wound made him very ill.

552
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,560
He could not walk and stayed in bed a long time.

553
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,200
But he did not get better - he got worse.

554
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:33,680
'I'm very ill,' said Tristan to Kahedin, 
'and I think I'm going to die soon.'

555
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,760
'No, Tristan!'

556
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,400
said Kahedin.

557
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,400
'Don't say that! You helped me during 
the battle and now I want to help you.

558
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,880
Tell me what I can do, my friend.'

559
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,800
'Only Queen Isolde of Cornwall 
can cure my wound because the  

560
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,680
spear was poisoned,' said Tristan weakly.

561
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,320
'She learned the secrets of the 
magic herbs from her mother.'

562
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,600
'Then I'll sail to Tintagel immediately,  

563
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,720
and ask Queen Isolde to come 
here and cure you,' said Kahedin.

564
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,320
'Oh, Kahedin, thank you!'

565
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,800
said Tristan.

566
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,320
'If Isolde comes with you, raise 
the white sail on your ship.

567
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,400
But if she doesn't, then raise the black sail.'

568
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,920
'Very well,' said Kahedin.

569
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,920
'I'm leaving this evening.

570
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,720
Isolde of the White Hands heard this 
conversation and she was angry and jealous.

571
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,960
Kahedin sailed to Cornwall and told King 
Mark and Queen Isolde about Tristan's wound.

572
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,600
'I must go and cure his wound with 
my magic herbs,' said Queen Isolde.

573
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,720
'I'm the only person who can save his life!'

574
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:01,880
King Mark looked at his wife and said, 
'Time is helping me to forget many things.

575
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,320
I think I can trust you now, Isolde.

576
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,480
Go and cure Tristan's wound.'

577
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,880
'Yes, my King,' said Queen Isolde 
quietly, 'you can trust me.'

578
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,560
Isolde left Cornwall with Kahedin the same 
day with some bottles of herbs and potions.

579
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,600
When the ship arrived near Tristan's 
castle Kahedin raised the white sail.

580
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:35,360
Tristan was very weak and could not get 
up from bed and look out of the window.

581
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,280
He called his wife and said, 
'Go and look out of the window.

582
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,840
Kahedin's ship will be here soon.

583
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,640
Can you see it?'

584
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:55,280
Isolde of the White Hands went to the window 
and saw Kahedin's ship with its big white sail.

585
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,720
'Oh, no,' she thought, 'the sail's 
white - Queen Isolde is here!'

586
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,400
She was very jealous.

587
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,560
'Yes, Tristan,' said Isolde of the 
White Hands, 'Kahedin's ship is here.'

588
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,160
'What colour is the sail?' asked Tristan weakly.

589
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,720
'The sail is...

590
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
black!'

591
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,520
answered Isolde of the White Hands.

592
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:29,480
'Oh, no, Isolde, my love,' said 
Tristan sadly, 'you didn't come to me.

593
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,280
I won't see your beautiful face again.

594
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,600
Dearest Isolde, dearest Isolde...'

595
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,760
and then he closed his eyes and died.

596
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,800
Queen Isolde came to Tristan's 
room and saw his dead body.

597
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,040
She sat down on the bed and 
looked at him for the last time.

598
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,040
Her sadness was very great and her heart broke.

599
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,240
She died next to him.

600
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,360
'What did I do! My terrible 
jealousy killed them both!'

601
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:14,360
said Isolde of the White Hands, and she 
was very sorry - but it was too late.

602
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,400
Tristan and Isolde were 
buried together in one grave.

603
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:27,320
And over the grave Isolde of the White Hands 
planted two rose trees, a red one and a white one.

604
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,800
They grew together with red and white roses.

605
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:56,920
And this is the end of the great love story of Sir 
Tristan of Lyonesse and Queen Isolde of Cornwall.
