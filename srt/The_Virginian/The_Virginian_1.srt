THE VIRGINIAN

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,800
by Owen WISTER

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,122
CHAPTER I

4
00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:05,883
Enter the Man

5
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:10,730
Some notable sight was drawing the
passengers, both men and women,

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,896
to the window; and therefore I rose and
crossed the car to see what it was.

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:20,309
I saw near the track an enclosure,
and round it some laughing men,

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,719
and inside it some whirling dust,
and amid the dust some horses,

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,150
plunging, huddling, and dodging.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,944
They were cow ponies in a corral,
and one of them would not be caught,

11
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,296
no matter who threw the rope.

12
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:37,359
We had plenty of time to watch this
sport, for our train had stopped that

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,436
the engine might take water at the tank
before it pulled us up beside the

14
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,596
station platform of Medicine Bow.

15
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:48,268
We were also six hours late,
and starving for entertainment.

16
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:52,436
The pony in the corral was wise,
and rapid of limb.

17
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:59,323
Have you seen a skilful boxer watch his
antagonist with a quiet, incessant eye?

18
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:04,563
Such an eye as this did the pony keep
upon whatever man took the rope.

19
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:07,561
The man might pretend to look at the
weather, which was fine;

20
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:12,284
or he might affect earnest conversation
with a bystander: it was bootless.

21
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,955
The pony saw through it.

22
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:16,426
No feint hoodwinked him.

23
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:19,811
This animal was thoroughly a
man of the world.

24
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:23,750
His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon
the dissembling foe,

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,555
and the gravity of his horse-expression
made the matter one of high comedy.

26
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,989
Then the rope would sail out at him,
but he was already elsewhere;

27
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,682
and if horses laugh,
gaiety must have abounded in that

28
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:35,373
corral.

29
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:39,714
Sometimes the pony took a turn alone;
next he had slid in a flash among his

30
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:43,783
brothers, and the whole of them like a
school of playful fish whipped round the

31
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:50,207
corral, kicking up the fine dust,
and (I take it) roaring with laughter.

32
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:54,548
Through the window-glass of our Pullman
the thud of their mischievous hoofs

33
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:59,819
reached us, and the strong,
humorous curses of the cowboys.

34
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,100
Then for the first time I noticed a man
who sat on the high gate of

35
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,989
the corral, looking on.

36
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:09,203
For he now climbed down with the
undulations of a tiger,

37
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:13,539
smooth and easy, as if his muscles
flowed beneath his skin.

38
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:19,807
The others had all visibly whirled the
rope, some of them even shoulder high.

39
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,640
I did not see his arm lift or move.

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,851
He appeared to hold the rope down
low, by his leg.

41
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:31,800
But like a sudden snake I saw the noose
go out its length and fall true;

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,172
and the thing was done.

43
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:38,052
As the captured pony walked in with a
sweet, church-door expression,

44
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:42,895
our train moved slowly on to the
station, and a passenger remarked,

45
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:45,936
“That man knows his business.”

46
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:51,268
But the passenger’s dissertation upon
roping I was obliged to lose,

47
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:54,349
for Medicine Bow was my station.

48
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,523
I bade my fellow-travellers goodbye,
and descended, a stranger,

49
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,440
into the great cattle land.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,020
And here in less than ten minutes I
learned news which made me

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,930
feel a stranger indeed.

52
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,053
My baggage was lost; it had not come on
my train; it was adrift somewhere back

53
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,435
in the two thousand miles
that lay behind me.

54
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:20,669
And by way of comfort,
the baggage-man remarked that passengers

55
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,710
often got astray from their trunks,
but the trunks mostly found

56
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,697
them after a while.

57
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:30,538
Having offered me this encouragement,
he turned whistling to his affairs and

58
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:33,528
left me planted in the baggage-
room at Medicine Bow.

59
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:39,443
I stood deserted among crates and boxes,
blankly holding my check,

60
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:41,541
hungry and forlorn.

61
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,682
I stared out through the door at the sky
and the plains; but I did not see the

62
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:50,401
antelope shining among the sagebrush,
nor the great sunset light of Wyoming.

63
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:56,308
Annoyance blinded my eyes to all things
save my grievance: I saw

64
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:57,708
only a lost trunk.

65
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,195
And I was muttering half-aloud,
“What a forsaken hole this is!”

66
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:05,291
when suddenly from outside on the
platform came a slow voice:⁠—

67
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,809
“Off to get married again?

68
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:07,964
Oh, don’t!”

69
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:13,641
The voice was Southern and gentle and
drawling; and a second voice came in

70
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,522
immediate answer, cracked
and querulous:⁠—

71
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,728
“It ain’t again.

72
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,166
Who says it’s again?

73
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,446
Who told you, anyway?”

74
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:22,575
And the first voice responded
caressingly:⁠—

75
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:25,004
“Why, your Sunday clothes
told me, Uncle Hughey.

76
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:28,153
They are speakin’ mighty
loud o’ nuptials.”

77
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:30,176
“You don’t worry me!”

78
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,342
snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.

79
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:36,938
And the other gently continued,
“Ain’t them gloves the same yu’ wore

80
00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:38,376
to your last weddin’?”

81
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,776
“You don’t worry me!

82
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,394
You don’t worry me!”

83
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,336
now screamed Uncle Hughey.

84
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:47,867
Already I had forgotten my trunk;
care had left me; I was aware of the

85
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:52,277
sunset, and had no desire but for
more of this conversation.

86
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:55,756
For it resembled none that I had heard in
my life so far.

87
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:59,157
I stepped to the door and looked out
upon the station platform.

88
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:04,238
Lounging there at ease against the wall
was a slim young giant,

89
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,084
more beautiful than pictures.

90
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:11,862
His broad, soft hat was pushed back;
a loose-knotted, dull-scarlet

91
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:16,344
handkerchief sagged from his throat;
and one casual thumb was hooked in the

92
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:19,893
cartridge-belt that slanted
across his hips.

93
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:25,477
He had plainly come many miles from
somewhere across the vast horizon,

94
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:28,289
as the dust upon him showed.

95
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,138
His boots were white with it.

96
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,748
His overalls were gray with it.

97
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,147
The weather-beaten bloom of his face
shone through it duskily,

98
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:39,255
as the ripe peaches look upon their
trees in a dry season.

99
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:44,109
But no dinginess of travel or shabbiness
of attire could tarnish the splendor

100
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,580
that radiated from his
youth and strength.

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,922
The old man upon whose temper his remarks
were doing such deadly work was combed

102
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:57,343
and curried to a finish,
a bridegroom swept and garnished;

103
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,489
but alas for age!

104
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:02,056
Had I been the bride,
I should have taken the

105
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:04,693
giant, dust and all.

106
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:08,114
He had by no means done with the old man.

107
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:11,557
“Why, yu’ve hung weddin’
gyarments on every limb!”

108
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:14,480
he now drawled, with admiration.

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,492
“Who is the lucky lady this trip?”

110
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,760
The old man seemed to vibrate.

111
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,210
“Tell you there ain’t been no other!

112
00:06:20,210 --> -1:59:59,000
Call me a Mormon, would you?

113
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,338
“Why, that⁠—”

115
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:26,583
“Call me a Mormon?

116
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,782
Then name some of my wives.

117
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,641
Name two.

118
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,515
Name one.

119
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:33,307
Dare you!”

120
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:35,232
“⁠—that Laramie wido’ promised you⁠—”

121
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,185
“Shucks!”

122
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:40,988
“⁠—only her doctor suddenly
ordered Southern climate and⁠—”

123
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,239
“Shucks!

124
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,429
You’re a false alarm.”

125
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:46,539
“⁠—so nothing but her
lungs came between you.

126
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,597
And next you’d most got united
with Cattle Kate, only⁠—”

127
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,459
“Tell you you’re a false alarm!”

128
00:06:52,459 --> -1:59:59,000
“⁠—only she got hung.

129
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

130
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,947
“Where’s the wives in all this?

131
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,598
Show the wives!

132
00:06:58,598 --> 00:06:59,452
Come now!”

133
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:03,333
“That corn-fed biscuit-shooter at Rawlins
yu’ gave the canary⁠—”

134
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,319
“Never married her.

135
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,369
Never did marry⁠—”

136
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,111
“But yu’ come so near, uncle!

137
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:10,384
She was the one left yu’ that letter
explaining how she’d got married to a

138
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:14,625
young cyard-player the very day before
her ceremony with you was due, and⁠—”

139
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,855
“Oh, you’re nothing; you’re a kid;
you don’t amount to⁠—”

140
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,295
“⁠—and how she’d never,
never forgot to feed the canary.”

141
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:28,006
“This country’s getting full of kids,”
stated the old man, witheringly.

142
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,173
“It’s doomed.”

143
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:32,244
This crushing assertion
plainly satisfied him.

144
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,953
And he blinked his eyes
with renewed anticipation.

145
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:39,884
His tall tormentor continued with a face
of unchanging gravity,

146
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:43,589
and a voice of gentle solicitude:⁠—

147
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,282
“How is the health of that unfortunate⁠—”

148
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:46,215
“That’s right!

149
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,809
Pour your insults!

150
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,973
Pour ’em on a sick, afflicted woman!”

151
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,892
The eyes blinked with combative relish.

152
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,582
“Insults?

153
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:58,180
Oh, no, Uncle Hughey!”

154
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,260
“That’s all right!

155
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,786
Insults goes!”

156
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:06,848
“Why, I was mighty relieved when she
began to recover her mem’ry.

157
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:11,290
Las’ time I heard, they told me she’d got
it pretty near all back.

158
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,014
Remembered her father,
and her mother, and her sisters and

159
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:18,771
brothers, and her friends,
and her happy childhood,

160
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,677
and all her doin’s except only your
face.

161
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,940
The boys was bettin’ she’d get that far
too, give her time.

162
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,377
But I reckon afteh such a turrable
sickness as she had,

163
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:31,461
that would be expectin’ most too much.”

164
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,601
At this Uncle Hughey jerked
out a small parcel.

165
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,600
“Shows how much you know!”

166
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,382
he cackled.

167
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,258
“There!

168
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,372
See that!

169
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:44,914
That’s my ring she sent me back,
being too unstrung for marriage.

170
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,794
So she don’t remember me, don’t she?

171
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,306
Ha-ha!

172
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:50,866
Always said you were a false alarm.”

173
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:53,490
The Southerner put more
anxiety into his tone.

174
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,382
“And so you’re a-takin’ the ring right on
to the next one!”

175
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,727
he exclaimed.

176
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:01,115
“Oh, don’t go to get married
again, Uncle Hughey!

177
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,844
What’s the use o’ being married?”

178
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,737
“What’s the use?”

179
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,109
echoed the bridegroom, with scorn.

180
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:09,209
“Hm!

181
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,553
When you grow up you’ll think different.”

182
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:15,972
“Course I expect to think different when
my age is different.

183
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,841
I’m havin’ the thoughts proper to twenty-
four, and you’re havin’ the

184
00:09:18,841 --> -1:59:59,000
thoughts proper to sixty.

185
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

186
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:21,058
“Fifty!”

187
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:23,933
shrieked Uncle Hughey, jumping in the air.

188
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,346
The Southerner took a
tone of self-reproach.

189
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:33,189
“Now, how could I forget you was fifty,”
he murmured, “when you have been telling

190
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,225
it to the boys so careful for
the last ten years!”

191
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:42,204
Have you ever seen a cockatoo⁠—the white
kind with the topknot⁠—enraged by

192
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:43,045
insult?

193
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:48,384
The bird erects every available
feather upon its person.

194
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:53,573
So did Uncle Hughey seem to swell,
clothes, mustache, and woolly white

195
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:57,799
beard; and without further speech he
took himself on board the Eastbound

196
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,659
train, which now arrived from its siding
in time to deliver him.

197
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:05,901
Yet this was not why he had
not gone away before.

198
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:10,221
At any time he could have escaped into
the baggage-room or withdrawn to a

199
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:13,689
dignified distance until his
train should come up.

200
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:17,853
But the old man had evidently got a sort
of joy from this teasing.

201
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:21,641
He had reached that inevitable age when
we are tickled to be linked with affairs

202
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,695
of gallantry, no matter how.

203
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:28,391
With him now the Eastbound departed
slowly into that distance

204
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,471
whence I had come.

205
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:34,425
I stared after it as it went its way to
the far shores of civilization.

206
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:39,818
It grew small in the unending gulf of
space, until all sign of its presence

207
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:44,810
was gone save a faint skein of smoke
against the evening sky.

208
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,717
And now my lost trunk came back into my
thoughts, and Medicine Bow

209
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,573
seemed a lonely spot.

210
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:56,695
A sort of ship had left me marooned in a
foreign ocean; the Pullman was

211
00:10:56,695 --> 00:11:00,283
comfortably steaming home to port,
while I⁠—how was I to

212
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,203
find Judge Henry’s ranch?

213
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:07,899
Where in this unfeatured
wilderness was Sunk Creek?

214
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,908
No creek or any water at all flowed here
that I could perceive.

215
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:17,099
My host had written he should meet me at
the station and drive me to his ranch.

216
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,847
This was all that I knew.

217
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,291
He was not here.

218
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,952
The baggage-man had not seen him lately.

219
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:27,229
The ranch was almost certain to be too
far to walk to, tonight.

220
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:32,479
My trunk⁠—I discovered myself still
staring dolefully after the vanished

221
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:37,784
Eastbound; and at the same instant I
became aware that the tall man was

222
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:42,546
looking gravely at me⁠—as gravely as he
had looked at Uncle Hughey

223
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:46,186
throughout their remarkable
conversation.

224
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:51,157
To see his eye thus fixing me and his
thumb still hooked in his cartridge-

225
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:55,478
belt, certain tales of travellers from
these parts forced themselves

226
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,641
disquietingly into my recollection.

227
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,298
Now that Uncle Hughey was gone,
was I to take his place and be,

228
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:07,074
for instance, invited to dance on the
platform to the music

229
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,755
of shots nicely aimed?

230
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:12,332
“I reckon I am looking for you,
seh,” the tall man now observed.

231
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,274
CHAPTER II

232
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,182
“When You Call Me That,Smile!”

233
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:20,226
We cannot see ourselves as others see us,
or I should know what appearance I cut

234
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,992
at hearing this from the tall man.

235
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,252
I said nothing, feeling uncertain.

236
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,831
“I reckon I am looking for you,
seh,” he repeated politely.

237
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,727
“I am looking for Judge
Henry,” I now replied.

238
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:36,220
He walked toward me, and I saw that in
inches he was not a giant.

239
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,060
He was not more than six feet.

240
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,665
It was Uncle Hughey that had made
him seem to tower.

241
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:47,509
But in his eye, in his face,
in his step, in the whole man,

242
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:53,244
there dominated a something potent to be
felt, I should think, by man or woman.

243
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:56,465
“The Judge sent me afteh you,
seh,” he now explained,

244
00:12:56,465 --> 00:13:00,436
in his civil Southern voice;
and he handed me a letter from my host.

245
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:03,859
Had I not witnessed his facetious
performances with Uncle Hughey,

246
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,516
I should have judged him wholly
ungifted with such powers.

247
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:11,747
There was nothing external about him but
what seemed the signs of a nature as

248
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,370
grave as you could meet.

249
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,878
But I had witnessed; and therefore
supposing that I knew him in spite of

250
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:22,149
his appearance, that I was,
so to speak, in his secret and could

251
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,564
give him a sort of wink,
I adopted at once a method of easiness.

252
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:31,721
It was so pleasant to be easy with a
large stranger, who instead of shooting

253
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:36,586
at your heels had very civilly
handed you a letter.

254
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,843
“You’re from old Virginia, I take it?”

255
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,092
I began.

256
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:45,487
He answered slowly, “Then you have
taken it correct, seh.”

257
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:50,831
A slight chill passed over my easiness,
but I went cheerily on

258
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,551
with a further inquiry.

259
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,594
“Find many oddities out
here like Uncle Hughey?”

260
00:13:55,594 --> 00:14:00,014
“Yes, seh, there is a right
smart of oddities around.

261
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,700
They come in on every train.”

262
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,715
At this point I dropped
my method of easiness.

263
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:08,115
“I wish that trunks came on
the train,” said I.

264
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,609
And I told him my predicament.

265
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:15,367
It was not to be expected that he would
be greatly moved at my loss;

266
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,678
but he took it with no comment whatever.

267
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:21,948
“We’ll wait in town for it,”
said he, always perfectly civil.

268
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:27,040
Now, what I had seen of “town” was,
to my newly arrived eyes,

269
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,811
altogether horrible.

270
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,191
If I could possibly sleep at the Judge’s
ranch, I preferred to do so.

271
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:35,044
“Is it too far to drive there tonight?”

272
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:35,982
I inquired.

273
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:38,214
He looked at me in a puzzled manner.

274
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:43,516
“For this valise,” I explained,
“contains all that I immediately need;

275
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,313
in fact, I could do without my trunk for
a day or two, if it is

276
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,773
not convenient to send.

277
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:54,172
So if we could arrive there not too late
by starting at once⁠—” I paused.

278
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,020
“It’s two hundred and sixty-three
miles,” said the Virginian.

279
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,583
To my loud ejaculation he made no answer,
but surveyed me a moment longer,

280
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,676
and then said, “Supper will
be about ready now.”

281
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:09,755
He took my valise, and I followed his
steps toward the eating-house in

282
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:10,746
silence.

283
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,137
I was dazed.

284
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:17,690
As we went, I read my host’s letter⁠—
a brief hospitable message.

285
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,517
He was very sorry not to meet me himself.

286
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:25,756
He had been getting ready to drive over,
when the surveyor appeared

287
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:26,554
and detained him.

288
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:30,595
Therefore in his stead he was sending a
trustworthy man to town,

289
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:33,735
who would look after me
and drive me over.

290
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:37,812
They were looking forward to my
visit with much pleasure.

291
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,038
This was all.

292
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,285
Yes, I was dazed.

293
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,827
How did they count distance
in this country?

294
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:48,974
You spoke in a neighborly fashion about
driving over to town,

295
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:52,724
and it meant⁠—I did not know
yet how many days.

296
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:56,750
And what would be meant by the term
“dropping in,” I wondered.

297
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,033
And how many miles would
be considered really far?

298
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:05,311
I abstained from further
questioning the “trustworthy man.”

299
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,798
My questions had not fared
excessively well.

300
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:11,338
He did not propose making me dance,
to be sure: that would

301
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,098
scarcely be trustworthy.

302
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,066
But neither did he propose to have
me familiar with him.

303
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:17,359
Why was this?

304
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:24,112
What had I done to elicit that veiled and
skilful sarcasm about oddities coming

305
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,361
in on every train?

306
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:29,512
Having been sent to look after me,
he would do so, would even carry my

307
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:32,792
valise; but I could not
be jocular with him.

308
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:38,215
This handsome, ungrammatical son of the
soil had set between us the bar of his

309
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,211
cold and perfect civility.

310
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:42,810
No polished person could
have done it better.

311
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,980
What was the matter?

312
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,473
I looked at him, and suddenly
it came to me.

313
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:51,001
If he had tried familiarity with me the
first two minutes of our acquaintance,

314
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:54,086
I should have resented it;
by what right, then,

315
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:55,339
had I tried it with him?

316
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,051
It smacked of patronizing:
on this occasion he had come off the

317
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,724
better gentleman of the two.

318
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:06,775
Here in flesh and blood was a truth which
I had long believed in words,

319
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,542
but never met before.

320
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:14,186
The creature we call a gentleman lies
deep in the hearts of thousands that are

321
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:18,338
born without chance to master the
outward graces of the type.

322
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:21,656
Between the station and the eating-house
I did a deal of straight thinking.

323
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:26,178
But my thoughts were destined presently
to be drowned in amazement at the rare

324
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,486
personage into whose society
fate had thrown me.

325
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:33,678
Town, as they called it,
pleased me the less, the longer I saw

326
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:33,987
it.

327
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:38,958
But until our language stretches itself
and takes in a new word of closer fit,

328
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,518
town will have to do for the name of
such a place as was Medicine Bow.

329
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:48,213
I have seen and slept in
many like it since.

330
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:52,062
Scattered wide, they littered the
frontier from the Columbia to the Rio

331
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:55,301
Grande, from the Missouri to the
Sierras.

332
00:17:55,301 --> 00:18:00,059
They lay stark, dotted over a planet of
treeless dust, like soiled

333
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,386
packs of cards.

334
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:05,233
Each was similar to the next,
as one old five-spot

335
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,139
of clubs resembles another.

336
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:11,133
Houses, empty bottles,
and garbage, they were forever of

337
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,774
the same shapeless pattern.

338
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:17,264
More forlorn they were than stale bones.

339
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:22,299
They seemed to have been strewn there by
the wind and to be waiting till the wind

340
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,671
should come again and blow them away.

341
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:29,212
Yet serene above their foulness swam a
pure and quiet light,

342
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:33,672
such as the East never sees;
they might be bathing in the air

343
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:36,783
of creation’s first morning.

344
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:43,036
Beneath sun and stars their days and
nights were immaculate and wonderful.

345
00:18:43,036 --> 00:18:47,249
Medicine Bow was my first,
and I took its dimensions,

346
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:53,212
twenty-nine buildings in all⁠—one coal
shute, one water tank,

347
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:59,015
the station, one store,
two eating-houses, one billiard hall,

348
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:05,698
two tool-houses, one feed stable,
and twelve others that for one reason

349
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:08,266
and another I shall not name.

350
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:12,867
Yet this wretched husk of squalor spent
thought upon appearances;

351
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:18,110
many houses in it wore a false front to
seem as if they were two stories high.

352
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,438
There they stood, rearing their pitiful
masquerade amid a fringe of old tin

353
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:29,380
cans, while at their very doors began a
world of crystal light,

354
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,688
a land without end, a space across which
Noah and Adam might come

355
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,563
straight from Genesis.

356
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:42,621
Into that space went wandering a road,
over a hill and down out of sight,

357
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:46,821
and up again smaller in the distance,
and down once more, and up once more,

358
00:19:46,821 --> -1:59:59,000
straining the eyes, and so away

359
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

360
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:52,463
Then I heard a fellow greet my Virginian.

361
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:56,452
He came rollicking out of a door,
and made a pass with his hand

362
00:19:56,452 --> -1:59:59,000
at the Virginian’s hat

363
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

364
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:03,736
The Southerner dodged it,
and I saw once more the tiger undulation

365
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:08,054
of body, and knew my escort was he of
the rope and the corral.

366
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,222
“How are yu’ Steve?”

367
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,616
he said to the rollicking man.

368
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:16,924
And in his tone I heard
instantly old friendship speaking.

369
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,038
With Steve he would take
and give familiarity.

370
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:27,069
Steve looked at me, and looked away⁠—
and that was all.

371
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,582
But it was enough.

372
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:33,396
In no company had I ever felt
so much an outsider.

373
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:36,802
Yet I liked the company,
and wished that it would like me.

374
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,098
“Just come to town?”

375
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:40,111
inquired Steve of the Virginian.

376
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:42,082
“Been here since noon.

377
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:43,602
Been waiting for the train.”

378
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:44,624
“Going out tonight?”

379
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,402
“I reckon I’ll pull out tomorro’.”

380
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:48,533
“Beds are all took,” said Steve.

381
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:50,853
This was for my benefit.

382
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:53,070
“Dear me,” said I.

383
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,566
“But I guess one of them drummers will
let yu’ double up with him.”

384
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,880
Steve was enjoying himself, I think.

385
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,418
He had his saddle and blankets,
and beds were nothing to him.

386
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:06,182
“Drummers, are they?”

387
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,393
asked the Virginian.

388
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:13,755
“Two Jews handling cigars,
one American with consumption killer,

389
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,455
and a Dutchman with jew’lry.”

390
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:20,668
The Virginian set down my valise,
and seemed to meditate.

391
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:24,448
“I did want a bed tonight,”
he murmured gently.

392
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:28,651
“Well,” Steve suggested,
“the American looks like

393
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:30,782
he washed the oftenest.”

394
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:34,784
“That’s of no consequence to
me,” observed the Southerner.

395
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,724
“Guess it’ll be when yu’ see ’em.”

396
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:38,795
“Oh, I’m meaning something different.

397
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:42,246
I wanted a bed to myself.”

398
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,726
“Then you’ll have to build one.”

399
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,581
“Bet yu’ I have the Dutchman’s.”

400
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,066
“Take a man that won’t scare.

401
00:21:47,066 --> -1:59:59,000
Bet yu’ drinks yu’ can’t
have the American’s.

402
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

403
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:52,900
“Go yu’ ” said the Virginian.

404
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,191
“I’ll have his bed without any fuss.

405
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,507
Drinks for the crowd.”

406
00:21:57,507 --> 00:22:01,413
“I suppose you have me beat,”
said Steve, grinning

407
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,798
at him affectionately.

408
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,601
“You’re such a son-of-a ⸻ when you
get down to work.

409
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:07,641
Well, so long!

410
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,054
I got to fix my horse’s hoofs.”

411
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:12,675
I had expected that the man
would be struck down.

412
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:17,243
He had used to the Virginian a term of
heaviest insult, I thought.

413
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:23,171
I had marvelled to hear it come so
unheralded from Steve’s friendly lips.

414
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:25,347
And now I marvelled still more.

415
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:30,475
Evidently he had meant no harm by it,
and evidently no offence had been taken.

416
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:34,678
Used thus, this language
was plainly complimentary.

417
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:38,961
I had stepped into a world new to me
indeed, and novelties were occurring

418
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:42,041
with scarce any time to
get breath between them.

419
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:45,761
As to where I should sleep,
I had forgotten that problem

420
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:48,062
altogether in my curiosity.

421
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,354
What was the Virginian going to do now?

422
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:54,496
I began to know that the quiet of
this man was volcanic.

423
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,966
“Will you wash first, sir?”

424
00:22:55,966 --> 00:23:00,835
We were at the door of the eating-house,
and he set my valise inside.

425
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:06,053
In my tenderfoot innocence I was looking
indoors for the washing arrangements.

426
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,032
“It’s out hyeh, seh,”
he informed me gravely,

427
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:11,102
but with strong Southern accent.

428
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:15,547
Internal mirth seemed often to heighten
the local flavor of his speech.

429
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:23,367
There were other times when it had scarce
any special accent or fault in grammar.

430
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:27,007
A trough was to my right,
slippery with soapy water;

431
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,499
and hanging from a roller above one end
of it was a rag of discouraging

432
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:32,429
appearance.

433
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:35,869
The Virginian caught it,
and it performed one whirling

434
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:38,212
revolution on its roller.

435
00:23:38,212 --> 00:23:41,897
Not a dry or clean inch could
be found on it.

436
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:45,015
He took off his hat, and put his
head in the door.

437
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,552
“Your towel, ma’am,” said he,
“has been too popular.”

438
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,160
She came out, a pretty woman.

439
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,895
Her eyes rested upon him for a moment,
then upon me with disfavor;

440
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:58,471
then they returned to his black hair.

441
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:06,189
“The allowance is one a day,”
said she, very quietly.

442
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:09,935
“But when folks are particular⁠—” She
completed her sentence by removing the

443
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:13,019
old towel and giving a clean one to us.

444
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,314
“Thank you, ma’am,” said the cowpuncher.

445
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:20,121
She looked once more at his black hair,
and without any word returned to

446
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,876
her guests at supper.

447
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:26,742
A pail stood in the trough,
almost empty; and this he filled for

448
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,914
me from a well.

449
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:33,164
There was some soap sliding at large in
the trough, but I got my own.

450
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:39,013
And then in a tin basin I removed as many
of the stains of travel as I was able.

451
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,477
It was not much of a toilet that I made
in this first wash-trough of my

452
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:47,211
experience, but it had to suffice,
and I took my seat at supper.

453
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:50,539
Canned stuff it was⁠—corned beef.

454
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,823
And one of my table companions said
the truth about it.

455
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:57,572
“When I slung my teeth over that,”
he remarked, “I thought I

456
00:24:57,572 --> 00:24:59,494
was chewing a hammock.”

457
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:03,027
We had strange coffee,
and condensed milk; and I have

458
00:25:03,027 --> 00:25:04,454
never seen more flies.

459
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:07,158
I made no attempt to talk,
for no one in this country

460
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:08,472
seemed favorable to me.

461
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:12,978
By reason of something⁠—my clothes,
my hat, my pronunciation,

462
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,538
whatever it might be,
I possessed the secret of

463
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:17,500
estranging people at sight.

464
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,710
Yet I was doing better than I knew;
my strict silence and attention to the

465
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,138
corned beef made me in the eyes of the
cowboys at table compare well with the

466
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,639
over-talkative commercial travellers.

467
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:32,110
The Virginian’s entrance
produced a slight silence.

468
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:38,437
He had done wonders with the wash-trough,
and he had somehow brushed his clothes.

469
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:42,162
With all the roughness of his dress,
he was now the neatest of us.

470
00:25:42,162 --> 00:25:47,148
He nodded to some of the other cowboys,
and began his meal in quiet.

471
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:50,381
But silence is not the native
element of the drummer.

472
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:53,951
An average fish can go a longer time out
of water than this breed

473
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,945
can live without talking.

474
00:25:55,945 --> 00:26:01,131
One of them now looked across the table
at the grave, flannel-shirted Virginian;

475
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:06,484
he inspected, and came to the imprudent
conclusion that he understood his man.

476
00:26:06,484 --> 00:26:09,280
“Good evening,” he said briskly.

477
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,289
“Good evening,” said the Virginian.

478
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,857
“Just come to town?”

479
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:14,097
pursued the drummer.

480
00:26:14,097 --> 00:26:17,993
“Just come to town,” the
Virginian suavely assented.

481
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,191
“Cattle business jumping along?”

482
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:21,612
inquired the drummer.

483
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:22,427
“Oh, fair.”

484
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:24,900
And the Virginian took
some more corned beef.

485
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,615
“Gets a move on your appetite,
anyway,” suggested the drummer.

486
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:30,871
The Virginian drank some coffee.

487
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:37,020
Presently the pretty woman refilled his
cup without his asking her.

488
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,571
“Guess I’ve met you before,”
the drummer stated next.

489
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:43,108
The Virginian glanced at him
for a brief moment.

490
00:26:43,108 --> 00:26:44,301
“Haven’t I, now?

491
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:45,623
Ain’t I seen you somewhere?

492
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:46,336
Look at me.

493
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:48,824
You been in Chicago, ain’t you?

494
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,451
You look at me well.

495
00:26:50,451 --> -1:59:59,000
Remember Ikey’s, don’t you?

496
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

497
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,779
“I don’t reckon I do.”

498
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,305
“See, now!

499
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,437
I knowed you’d been in Chicago.

500
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,637
Four or five years ago.

501
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,807
Or maybe it’s two years.

502
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,688
Time’s nothing to me.

503
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:08,025
But I never forget a face.

504
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,528
Yes, sir.

505
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,693
Him and me’s met at Ikey’s, all right.”

506
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:14,959
This important point the drummer stated
to all of us.

507
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:19,439
We were called to witness how well he
had proved old acquaintanceship.

508
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,587
“Ain’t the world small, though!”

509
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,419
he exclaimed complacently.

510
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,428
“Meet a man once and you’re sure to run
on to him again.

511
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:28,659
That’s straight.

512
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,579
That’s no barroom josh.”

513
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:34,311
And the drummer’s eye included us
all in his confidence.

514
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:37,951
I wondered if he had attained that high
perfection when a man

515
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:40,065
believes his own lies.

516
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:43,049
The Virginian did not seem interested.

517
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,142
He placidly attended to his food,
while our landlady moved between dining

518
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:49,216
room and kitchen, and
the drummer expanded.

519
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,279
“Yes, sir!

520
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,237
Ikey’s over by the stockyards,
patronized by all cattlemen

521
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,803
that know what’s what.

522
00:27:55,803 --> 00:27:56,563
That’s where.

523
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:58,243
Maybe it’s three years.

524
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,102
Time never was nothing to me.

525
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:03,599
But faces!

526
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,137
Why, I can’t quit ’em.

527
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:10,951
Adults or children, male and female;
onced I seen ’em I couldn’t lose one off

528
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:16,411
my memory, not if you were to pay me
bounty, five dollars a face.

529
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,670
White men, that is.

530
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,604
Can’t do nothing with niggers or Chinese.

531
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,132
But you’re white, all right.”

532
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:27,947
The drummer suddenly returned to the
Virginian with this high compliment.

533
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:32,432
The cowpuncher had taken out a pipe,
and was slowly rubbing it.

534
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:36,859
The compliment seemed to escape his
attention, and the drummer went on.

535
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:41,023
“I can tell a man when he’s white,
put him at Ikey’s or out loose

536
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,463
here in the sagebrush.”

537
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:46,644
And he rolled a cigar across
to the Virginian’s plate.

538
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,334
“Selling them?”

539
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:51,516
inquired the Virginian.

540
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:55,098
“Solid goods, my friend.

541
00:28:55,098 --> 00:29:01,380
Havana wrappers, the biggest tobacco
proposition for five cents got out yet.

542
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,242
Take it, try it, light it, watch it burn.

543
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:06,732
Here.”

544
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:08,865
And he held out a bunch of matches.

545
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:11,917
The Virginian tossed a five-cent
piece over to him.

546
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,880
“Oh, no, my friend!

547
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,540
Not from you!

548
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,091
Not after Ikey’s.

549
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,772
I don’t forget you.

550
00:29:18,772 --> 00:29:21,073
See?

551
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:26,486
I knowed your face right away.

552
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:29,353
See?

553
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,576
That’s straight.

554
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:32,625
I seen you at Chicago all right.”

555
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,688
“Maybe you did,” said the Virginian.

556
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:38,037
“Sometimes I’m mighty careless
what I look at.”

557
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,571
“Well, py damn!”

558
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,361
now exclaimed the Dutch
drummer, hilariously.

559
00:29:42,361 --> 00:29:44,631
“I am ploom disappointed.

560
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:47,711
I vas hoping to sell him
somedings myself.”

561
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:51,014
“Not the same here,” stated the American.

562
00:29:51,014 --> 00:29:53,415
“He’s too healthy for me.

563
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:55,087
I gave him up on sight.”

564
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:59,175
Now it was the American drummer whose bed
the Virginian had in his eye.

565
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:02,055
This was a sensible man,
and had talked less than his

566
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:03,375
brothers in the trade.

567
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:06,625
I had little doubt who would end by
sleeping in his bed;

568
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:10,901
but how the thing would be done
interested me more deeply than ever.

569
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:15,207
The Virginian looked amiably at his
intended victim, and made one or two

570
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,209
remarks regarding patent medicines.

571
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:22,000
There must be a good deal of money in
them, he supposed, with a live

572
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,263
man to manage them.

573
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:25,023
The victim was flattered.

574
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,340
No other person at the table had been
favored with so much of

575
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,772
the tall cowpuncher’s notice.

576
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:33,797
He responded, and they
had a pleasant talk.

577
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:38,063
I did not divine that the Virginian’s
genius was even then at work,

578
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:41,448
and that all this was part
of his satanic strategy.

579
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:43,936
But Steve must have divined it.

580
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:48,594
For while a few of us still sat finishing
our supper, that facetious horseman

581
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:52,554
returned from doctoring his horse’s
hoofs, put his head into the dining

582
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:57,847
room, took in the way in which the
Virginian was engaging his victim in

583
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:01,504
conversation, remarked
aloud, “I’ve lost!”

584
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:03,079
and closed the door again.

585
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,209
“What’s he lost?”

586
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:05,989
inquired the American drummer.

587
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,241
“Oh, you mustn’t mind
him,” drawled the Virginian.

588
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:13,229
“He’s one of those box-head jokers goes
around openin’ and shuttin’

589
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:14,149
doors that-a-way.

590
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:15,808
We call him harmless.

591
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:19,337
Well,” he broke off, “I
reckon I’ll go smoke.

592
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:20,712
Not allowed in hyeh?”

593
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,069
This last he addressed to the
landlady, with especial gentleness.

594
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:29,567
She shook her head, and her eyes followed
him as he went out.

595
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:34,905
Left to myself I meditated for some time
upon my lodging for the night,

596
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:38,567
and smoked a cigar for consolation
as I walked about.

597
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:43,127
It was not a hotel that we had supped in.

598
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,674
Hotel at Medicine Bow there
appeared to be none.

599
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:52,960
But connected with the eating-house was
that place where, according to Steve,

600
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,941
the beds were all taken,
and there I went to see for myself.

601
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:59,154
Steve had spoken the truth.

602
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:04,751
It was a single apartment containing four
or five beds, and nothing else whatever.

603
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:09,700
And when I looked at these beds,
my sorrow that I could sleep in none

604
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,111
of them grew less.

605
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:15,111
To be alone in one offered no temptation,
and as for this courtesy of the

606
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:19,445
country, this doubling up⁠—!

607
00:32:19,445 --> 00:32:21,577
“Well, they have got ahead of us.”

608
00:32:21,577 --> 00:32:23,697
This was the Virginian
standing at my elbow.

609
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:24,758
I assented.

610
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:28,059
“They have staked out
their claims,” he added.

611
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:32,932
In this public sleeping room they had
done what one does to secure a seat

612
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:37,132
in a railroad train.

613
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:50,282
Upon each bed, as notice of occupancy,
lay some article of travel or of dress.

614
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:55,687
As we stood there, the two Jews came in
and opened and arranged their valises,

615
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:59,727
and folded and refolded
their linen dusters.

616
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,810
Then a railroad employee entered and
began to go to bed at this hour,

617
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,368
before dusk had wholly
darkened into night.

618
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:11,117
For him, going to bed meant removing his
boots and placing his overalls and

619
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:12,683
waistcoat beneath his pillow.

620
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:14,134
He had no coat.

621
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:18,043
His work began at three in the morning;
and even as we still talked

622
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:19,357
he began to snore.

623
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:22,677
“The man that keeps the store is a friend
of mine,” said the Virginian;

624
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:25,237
“and you can be pretty near
comfortable on his counter.

625
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,677
Got any blankets?”

626
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,215
I had no blankets.

627
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,427
“Looking for a bed?”

628
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:32,065
inquired the American
drummer, now arriving.

629
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:37,338
“Yes, he’s looking for a bed,”
answered the voice of Steve behind him.

630
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:41,199
“Seems a waste of time,”
observed the Virginian.

631
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,717
He looked thoughtfully from
one bed to another.

632
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:46,171
“I didn’t know I’d have to lay over here.

633
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,123
Well, I have sat up before.”

634
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:51,589
“This one’s mine,” said the drummer,
sitting down on it.

635
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,126
“Half’s plenty enough room for me.”

636
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:57,182
“You’re cert’nly mighty
kind,” said the cowpuncher.

637
00:33:57,182 --> 00:34:00,053
“But I’d not think o’
disconveniencing yu’.”

638
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,705
“That’s nothing.

639
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:04,534
The other half is yours.

640
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,814
Turn in right now if you feel like it.”

641
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:07,961
“No.

642
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:10,822
I don’t reckon I’ll turn in right now.

643
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,785
Better keep your bed to yourself.”

644
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:17,026
“See here,” urged the drummer,
“if I take you I’m safe from drawing

645
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,458
some party I might not
care so much about.

646
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,882
This here sleeping proposition
is a lottery.”

647
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:27,654
“Well,” said the Virginian (and his
hesitation was truly masterly),

648
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:29,485
“if you put it that way⁠—”

649
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,411
“I do put it that way.

650
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,638
Why, you’re clean!

651
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:35,198
You’ve had a shave right now.

652
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,672
You turn in when you feel
inclined, old man!

653
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:40,349
I ain’t retiring just yet.”

654
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:44,140
The drummer had struck a slightly false
note in these last remarks.

655
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,749
He should not have said “old man.”

656
00:34:46,749 --> 00:34:52,990
Until this I had thought him merely an
amiable person who wished to do a favor.

657
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,439
But “old man” came in wrong.

658
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:59,795
It had a hateful taint of his profession;
the being too soon with everybody,

659
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:03,655
the celluloid good-fellowship that
passes for ivory with nine in ten

660
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:04,796
of the city crowd.

661
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:08,533
But not so with the sons of the sagebrush.

662
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:12,760
They live nearer nature,
and they know better.

663
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,668
But the Virginian blandly accepted “old
man” from his victim:

664
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:18,847
he had a game to play.

665
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:22,478
“Well, I cert’nly thank yu’,” he said.

666
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:25,614
“After a while I’ll take advantage
of your kind offer.”

667
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:26,830
I was surprised.

668
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,507
Possession being nine points of the law,
it seemed his very chance to intrench

669
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,405
himself in the bed.

670
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:37,612
But the cowpuncher had planned a
campaign needing no intrenchments.

671
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:42,452
Moreover, going to bed before nine
o’clock upon the first evening in many

672
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:46,972
weeks that a town’s resources were open
to you, would be a dull proceeding.

673
00:35:46,972 --> 00:35:51,672
Our entire company, drummer and all,
now walked over to the store,

674
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:55,198
and here my sleeping
arrangements were made easily.

675
00:35:55,198 --> 00:36:00,019
This store was the cleanest place and the
best in Medicine Bow,

676
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:03,896
and would have been a good store
anywhere, offering a multitude of things

677
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,989
for sale, and kept by
a very civil proprietor.

678
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,828
He bade me make myself at home,
and placed both of his

679
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:11,696
counters at my disposal.

680
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:16,702
Upon the grocery side there stood a
cheese too large and strong to sleep

681
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:20,215
near comfortably, and I therefore chose
the dry-goods side.

682
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:25,688
Here thick quilts were unrolled for me,
to make it soft; and no condition was

683
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:30,013
placed upon me, further than that I
should remove my boots,

684
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:35,168
because the quilts were new,
and clean, and for sale.

685
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:37,714
So now my rest was assured.

686
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:41,788
Not an anxiety remained in my thoughts.

687
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:47,346
These therefore turned themselves wholly
to the other man’s bed,

688
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:49,431
and how he was going to lose it.

689
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:52,631
I think that Steve was more
curious even than myself.

690
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:54,020
Time was on the wing.

691
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,142
His bet must be decided,
and the drinks enjoyed.

692
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:04,487
He stood against the grocery
counter, contemplating the Virginian.

693
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,732
But it was to me that he spoke.

694
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:10,062
The Virginian, however,
listened to every word.

695
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,353
“Your first visit to this country?”

696
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,848
I told him yes.

697
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:16,104
“How do you like it?”

698
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:18,294
I expected to like it very much.

699
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:20,244
“How does the climate strike you?”

700
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,023
I thought the climate was fine.

701
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,557
“Makes a man thirsty though.”

702
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:26,762
This was the sub-current which the
Virginian plainly looked for.

703
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:30,296
But he, like Steve, addressed
himself to me.

704
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:35,280
“Yes,” he put in, “thirsty while
a man’s soft yet.

705
00:37:35,280 --> -1:59:59,000
You’ll harden.

706
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

707
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:39,971
“I guess you’ll find it a drier country
than you were given to

708
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,422
expect,” said Steve.

709
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:46,818
“If your habits have been frequent that
way,” said the Virginian.

710
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:50,653
“There’s parts of Wyoming,”
pursued Steve, “where you’ll go hours

711
00:37:50,653 --> -1:59:59,000
and hours before you’ll see
a drop of wetness.

712
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

713
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:58,330
“And if yu’ keep a-thinkin’ about it,”
said the Virginian, “it’ll seem

714
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,743
like days and days.”

715
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:04,913
Steve, at this stroke,
gave up, and clapped him on the shoulder

716
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,115
with a joyous chuckle.

717
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:08,129
“You old son-of-a ⸻!”

718
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:09,558
he cried affectionately.

719
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:12,623
“Drinks are due now,” said the Virginian.

720
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,331
“My treat, Steve.

721
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:17,808
But I reckon your suspense will have to
linger a while yet.”

722
00:38:17,808 --> 00:38:22,418
Thus they dropped into direct talk from
that speech of the fourth dimension

723
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,287
where they had been using
me for their telephone.

724
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,238
“Any cyards going tonight?”

725
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:27,668
inquired the Virginian.

726
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:32,496
“Stud and draw,” Steve told him.

727
00:38:32,496 --> -1:59:59,000
“Strangers playing.

728
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

729
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:40,236
“I think I’d like to get into a game for
a while,” said the Southerner.

730
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,756
“Strangers, yu’ say?”

731
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:45,299
And then, before quitting the store,
he made his toilet for this

732
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,529
little hand at poker.

733
00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:48,399
It was a simple preparation.

734
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:52,159
He took his pistol from its holster,
examined it, then shoved it between his

735
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,200
overalls and his shirt in front,
and pulled his waistcoat over it.

736
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,881
He might have been combing his hair for
all the attention anyone paid

737
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:01,985
to this, except myself.

738
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:06,081
Then the two friends went out,
and I bethought me of that epithet which

739
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:10,201
Steve again had used to the Virginian as
he clapped him on the shoulder.

740
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:15,583
Clearly this wild country spoke a
language other than mine⁠—the word here

741
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,248
was a term of endearment.

742
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,605
Such was my conclusion.

743
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:22,583
The drummers had finished their dealings
with the proprietor,

744
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:26,063
and they were gossiping together in a
knot by the door as the

745
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,451
Virginian passed out.

746
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,903
“See you later, old man!”

747
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:32,503
This was the American drummer
accosting his prospective bedfellow.

748
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,510
“Oh, yes,” returned the
bedfellow, and was gone.

749
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:44,907
The American drummer winked
triumphantly at his brethren.

750
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,175
“He’s all right,” he observed,
jerking a thumb after the Virginian.

751
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:50,245
“He’s easy.

752
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:53,168
You got to know him to work him.

753
00:39:53,168 --> -1:59:59,000
That’s all.

754
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

755
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,087
“Und vat is your point?”

756
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:58,949
inquired the German drummer.

757
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:03,194
“Point is⁠—he’ll not take any goods off
you or me; but he’s going to talk up the

758
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,961
killer to any consumptive he runs
across.

759
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,292
I ain’t done with him yet.

760
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:11,106
Say,” (he now addressed the
proprietor), “what’s her name?”

761
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:11,837
“Whose name?”

762
00:40:11,837 --> 00:40:13,513
“Woman runs the eating-house.”

763
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:14,065
“Glen.

764
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:14,473
Mrs.

765
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:15,006
Glen.”

766
00:40:15,006 --> 00:40:16,073
“Ain’t she new?”

767
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:17,710
“Been settled here about a month.

768
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,553
Husband’s a freight conductor.”

769
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,319
“Thought I’d not seen her before.

770
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,747
She’s a good-looker.”

771
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:23,274
“Hm!

772
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:24,064
Yes.

773
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:28,125
The kind of good looks I’d sooner see in
another man’s wife than mine.”

774
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,318
“So that’s the gait, is it?”

775
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:30,848
“Hm!

776
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,226
well, it don’t seem to be.

777
00:40:33,226 --> 00:40:35,557
She come here with that reputation.

778
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:38,027
But there’s been general disappointment.”

779
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:40,598
“Then she ain’t lacked suitors any?”

780
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:41,597
“Lacked!

781
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:44,077
Are you acquainted with cowboys?”

782
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:46,639
“And she disappointed ’em?

783
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,815
Maybe she likes her husband?”

784
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:49,335
“Hm!

785
00:40:49,335 --> -1:59:59,000
well, how are you to tell
about them silent kind?

786
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

787
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:55,845
“Talking of conductors,”
began the drummer.

788
00:40:55,845 --> 00:41:01,296
And we listened to his anecdote.

789
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:08,599
It was successful with his audience;
but when he launched fluently upon a

790
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,055
second I strolled out.

791
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:14,753
There was not enough wit in this narrator
to relieve his indecency,

792
00:41:14,753 --> 00:41:18,920
and I felt shame at having been
surprised into laughing with him.

793
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,002
I left that company growing confidential
over their leering stories,

794
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,545
and I sought the saloon.

795
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,241
It was very quiet and orderly.

796
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:32,986
Beer in quart bottles at a dollar I had
never met before; but saving its price,

797
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:35,154
I found no complaint to make of it.

798
00:41:35,154 --> 00:41:40,884
Through folding doors I passed from the
bar proper with its bottles and elk head

799
00:41:40,884 --> 00:41:43,519
back to the hall with its various
tables.

800
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:49,155
I saw a man sliding cards from a case,
and across the table from him another

801
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:51,043
man laying counters down.

802
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:56,640
Near by was a second dealer pulling cards
from the bottom of a pack,

803
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,646
and opposite him a solemn old rustic
piling and changing coins upon the cards

804
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,419
which lay already exposed.

805
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:09,380
But now I heard a voice that drew my eyes
to the far corner of the room.

806
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,073
“Why didn’t you stay in Arizona?”

807
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,012
Harmless looking words as I
write them down here.

808
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:19,960
Yet at the sound of them I noticed the
eyes of the others directed

809
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,961
to that corner.

810
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:26,889
What answer was given to them I did not
hear, nor did I see who spoke.

811
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,759
Then came another remark.

812
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:32,234
“Well, Arizona’s no place for amatures.”

813
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:36,714
This time the two card dealers that I
stood near began to give a part of their

814
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,787
attention to the group that
sat in the corner.

815
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:44,827
There was in me a desire
to leave this room.

816
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:50,684
So far my hours at Medicine Bow had
seemed to glide beneath a sunshine of

817
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:53,720
merriment, of easygoing jocularity.

818
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,244
This was suddenly gone,
like the wind changing to north in the

819
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,742
middle of a warm day.

820
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,797
But I stayed, being ashamed to go.

821
00:43:01,797 --> 00:43:06,698
Five or six players sat over in the
corner at a round table

822
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:08,125
where counters were piled.

823
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:12,612
Their eyes were close upon their cards,
and one seemed to be dealing a card at a

824
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:16,454
time to each, with pauses
and betting between.

825
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,706
Steve was there and the Virginian;
the others were new faces.

826
00:43:21,706 --> 00:43:26,431
“No place for amatures,”
repeated the voice; and now I saw that

827
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:27,546
it was the dealer’s.

828
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:32,763
There was in his countenance the same
ugliness that his words conveyed.

829
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:34,013
“Who’s that talkin’?”

830
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:36,995
said one of the men near me,
in a low voice.

831
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:37,555
“Trampas.”

832
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:38,860
“What’s he?”

833
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,376
“Cowpuncher, broncobuster,
tin-horn, most anything.”

834
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:44,494
“Who’s he talkin’ at?”

835
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:48,275
“Think it’s the black-headed
guy he’s talking at.”

836
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,815
“That ain’t supposed to be safe, is it?”

837
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:53,784
“Guess we’re all goin’ to find out
in a few minutes.”

838
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:55,478
“Been trouble between ’em?”

839
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:56,815
“They’ve not met before.

840
00:43:56,815 --> 00:44:00,475
Trampas don’t enjoy losin’ to a stranger.”

841
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:02,600
“Fello’s from Arizona, yu’ say?”

842
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,795
“No.

843
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:05,970
Virginia.

844
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,988
He’s recently back from havin’
a look at Arizona.

845
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:13,242
Went down there last year for a change.

846
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:15,061
Works for the Sunk Creek outfit.”

847
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:19,533
And then the dealer lowered his voice
still further and said something in the

848
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,158
other man’s ear, causing him to grin.

849
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:24,871
After which both of them looked at me.

850
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,775
There had been silence over in the
corner; but now the man

851
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,295
Trampas spoke again.

852
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:36,574
“And ten,” said he, sliding out some
chips from before him.

853
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:40,328
Very strange it was to hear him,
how he contrived to make those

854
00:44:40,328 --> 00:44:42,374
words a personal taunt.

855
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:46,567
The Virginian was looking at his cards.

856
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,011
He might have been deaf.

857
00:44:48,011 --> 00:44:50,769
“And twenty,” said the
next player, easily.

858
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:53,360
The next threw his cards down.

859
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,141
It was now the Virginian’s turn to bet,
or leave the game, and he did

860
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:58,611
not speak at once.

861
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:00,973
Therefore Trampas spoke.

862
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:03,397
“Your bet, you son-of-a ⸻.”

863
00:45:03,397 --> 00:45:06,465
The Virginian’s pistol came out,
and his hand lay on the

864
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:08,292
table, holding it unaimed.

865
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:12,616
And with a voice as gentle as ever,
the voice that sounded almost like a

866
00:45:12,616 --> 00:45:17,195
caress, but drawling a very little more
than usual, so that there was almost a

867
00:45:17,195 --> 00:45:20,235
space between each word,
he issued his orders

868
00:45:20,235 --> 00:45:21,355
to the man Trampas:⁠—

869
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,581
“When you call me that, smile.”

870
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,606
And he looked at Trampas across the table.

871
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:29,006
Yes, the voice was gentle.

872
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:33,066
But in my ears it seemed as if somewhere
the bell of death was ringing;

873
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:36,692
and silence, like a stroke,
fell on the large room.

874
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:44,224
All men present, as if by some magnetic
current, had become aware of this

875
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:45,286
crisis.

876
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:49,992
In my ignorance, and the total stoppage
of my thoughts, I stood stock-still,

877
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:54,901
and noticed various people crouching,
or shifting their positions.

878
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:59,436
“Sit quiet,” said the dealer,
scornfully to the man near me.

879
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:01,839
“Can’t you see he don’t
want to push trouble?

880
00:46:01,839 --> -1:59:59,000
He has handed Trampas the choice to back
down or draw his steel.

881
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

882
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:13,355
Then, with equal suddenness and ease,
the room came out of its strangeness.

883
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:17,356
Voices and cards, the click of chips,
the puff of tobacco,

884
00:46:17,356 --> 00:46:23,979
glasses lifted to drink⁠—this level of
smooth relaxation hinted no more plainly

885
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:28,267
of what lay beneath than does the
surface tell the depth of the sea.

886
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:30,290
For Trampas had made his choice.

887
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,230
And that choice was not
to “draw his steel.”

888
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,970
If it was knowledge that he sought,
he had found it, and no mistake!

889
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,367
We heard no further reference to what he
had been pleased to style “amatures.”

890
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:45,354
In no company would the black-headed man
who had visited Arizona be rated a

891
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:47,867
novice at the cool art
of self-preservation.

892
00:46:47,867 --> 00:46:51,806
One doubt remained: what kind of
a man was Trampas?

893
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:55,907
A public back-down is an unfinished
thing⁠—for some natures at least.

894
00:46:55,907 --> 00:46:58,508
I looked at his face,
and thought it sullen,

895
00:46:58,508 --> 00:47:00,998
but tricky rather than courageous.

896
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:03,278
Something had been added
to my knowledge also.

897
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:07,898
Once again I had heard applied to the
Virginian that epithet which

898
00:47:07,898 --> 00:47:09,700
Steve so freely used.

899
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,812
The same words, identical to the letter.

900
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:15,678
But this time they had produced a pistol.

901
00:47:15,678 --> 00:47:17,415
“When you call me that, smile!”

902
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:21,109
So I perceived a new example of the old
truth, that the letter means nothing

903
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:22,963
until the spirit gives it life.

904
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,300
CHAPTER III

905
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,864
Steve Treats

906
00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:29,693
It was for several minutes,
I suppose, that I stood

907
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,798
drawing these silent morals.

908
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:35,690
No man occupied himself with me.

909
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:41,397
Quiet voices, and games of chance,
and glasses lifted to drink,

910
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:44,070
continued to be the peaceful
order of the night.

911
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:48,173
And into my thoughts broke the voice of
that card-dealer who had

912
00:47:48,173 --> 00:47:49,915
already spoken so sagely.

913
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:52,877
He also took his turn at moralizing.

914
00:47:52,877 --> 00:47:53,923
“What did I tell you?”

915
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:58,756
he remarked to the man for whom he
continued to deal, and who continued to

916
00:47:58,756 --> 00:47:59,945
lose money to him.

917
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:00,922
“Tell me when?”

918
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:03,442
“Didn’t I tell you he’d not shoot?”

919
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:05,468
the dealer pursued with complacence.

920
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:07,429
“You got ready to dodge.

921
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:12,252
You had no call to be concerned.

922
00:48:12,252 --> 00:48:15,202
He’s not the kind a man
need feel anxious about.”

923
00:48:15,202 --> 00:48:18,212
The player looked over
at the Virginian, doubtfully.

924
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:22,205
“Well,” he said, “I don’t know what you
folks call a dangerous man.”

925
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:23,041
“Not him!”

926
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,202
exclaimed the dealer with admiration.

927
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,362
“He’s a brave man.

928
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,429
That’s different.”

929
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:30,813
The player seemed to follow this
reasoning no better than I did.

930
00:48:30,813 --> 00:48:34,584
“It’s not a brave man that’s
dangerous,” continued the dealer.

931
00:48:34,584 --> 00:48:36,559
“It’s the cowards that scare me.”

932
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,433
He paused that this might sink home.

933
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,754
“Fello’ came in here las’ Toosday

934
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:42,666
,” he went on.

935
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:46,128
“He got into some misunderstanding
about the drinks.

936
00:48:46,128 --> 00:48:52,868
Well, sir, before we could put him out of
business, he’d hurt two

937
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:55,065
perfectly innocent onlookers.

938
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:58,810
They’d no more to do with it than you
have,” the dealer explained to me.

939
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,465
“Were they badly hurt?”

940
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:01,665
I asked.

941
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:02,649
“One of ’em was.

942
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,214
He’s died since.”

943
00:49:04,214 --> 00:49:05,589
“What became of the man?”

944
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:08,309
“Why, we put him out of
business, I told you.

945
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:10,346
He died that night.

946
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:14,217
But there was no occasion for any of it;
and that’s why I never like to be around

947
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,292
where there’s a coward.

948
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,384
You can’t tell.

949
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:19,897
He’ll always go to shooting before it’s
necessary, and there’s no

950
00:49:19,897 --> 00:49:21,406
security who he’ll hit.

951
00:49:21,406 --> 00:49:26,691
But a man like that black-headed guy is
(the dealer indicated the Virginian)

952
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:27,977
need never worry you.

953
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:31,447
And there’s another point why there’s no
need to worry about him:

954
00:49:31,447 --> -1:59:59,000
it’ll be too late.

955
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

956
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,270
These good words ended the
moralizing of the dealer.

957
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,434
He had given us a piece of his mind.

958
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,173
He now gave the whole of
it to dealing cards.

959
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:45,428
I loitered here and there,
neither welcome nor unwelcome at

960
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:48,585
present, watching the
cowboys at their play.

961
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:53,314
Saving Trampas, there was scarce a face
among them that had not in

962
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:55,037
it something very likable.

963
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:59,314
Here were lusty horsemen ridden from the
heat of the sun, and the wet of the

964
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:02,275
storm, to divert themselves awhile.

965
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:07,111
Youth untamed sat here for an idle
moment, spending easily

966
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:08,938
its hard-earned wages.

967
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:14,215
City saloons rose into my vision,
and I instantly preferred

968
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,580
this Rocky Mountain place.

969
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,620
More of death it undoubtedly saw,
but less of vice, than did

970
00:50:20,620 --> -1:59:59,000
its New York equivalents

971
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

972
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:25,272
And death is a thing much
cleaner than vice.

973
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:29,655
Moreover, it was by no means vice that
was written upon these

974
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,730
wild and manly faces.

975
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:36,177
Even where baseness was visible,
baseness was not uppermost.

976
00:50:36,177 --> 00:50:42,311
Daring, laughter, endurance⁠—these were
what I saw upon the countenances

977
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,609
of the cowboys.

978
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:48,686
And this very first day of my knowledge
of them marks a date with me.

979
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:51,920
For something about them,
and the idea of them,

980
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,037
smote my American heart,
and I have never forgotten it,

981
00:50:56,037 --> 00:50:58,955
nor ever shall, as long as I live.

982
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:04,713
In their flesh our natural passions ran
tumultuous; but often in their spirit

983
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:09,985
sat hidden a true nobility,
and often beneath its unexpected shining

984
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:13,181
their figures took on heroic stature.

985
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:17,827
The dealer had styled the Virginian
“a black-headed guy.”

986
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:20,796
This did well enough as
an unflattered portrait.

987
00:51:20,796 --> 00:51:26,508
Judge Henry’s trustworthy man,
with whom I was to drive two hundred and

988
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:30,560
sixty-three miles, certainly had a very
black head of hair.

989
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,119
It was the first thing to notice now,
if one glanced generally at the table

990
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,682
where he sat at cards.

991
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:40,953
But the eye came back to him⁠—drawn by
that inexpressible something which had

992
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:43,810
led the dealer to speak so much
at length about him.

993
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:50,027
Still, “black-headed guy” justly fits him
and his next performance.

994
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:54,508
He had made his plan for this like a true
and (I must say) inspired devil.

995
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:58,348
And now the highly appreciative town of
Medicine Bow was to be treated to

996
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,039
a manifestation of genius.

997
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:02,959
He sat playing his stud-poker.

998
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:07,199
After a decent period of losing and
winning, which gave Trampas all proper

999
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,428
time for a change of luck and a
repairing of his fortunes,

1000
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,623
he looked at Steve and said amiably:⁠—

1001
00:52:13,623 --> 00:52:16,136
“How does bed strike you?”

1002
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:20,777
I was beside their table,
learning gradually that stud-poker has

1003
00:52:20,777 --> 00:52:25,942
in it more of what I will call red
pepper than has our Eastern game.

1004
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,178
The Virginian followed his own question:⁠—

1005
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,445
“Bed strikes me,” he stated.

1006
00:52:30,445 --> 00:52:32,989
Steve feigned indifference.

1007
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:37,445
He was far more deeply absorbed in his
bet and the American drummer than he was

1008
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:42,020
in this game; but he chose to take out a
fat, florid gold watch,

1009
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,289
consult it elaborately,
and remark, “It’s only eleven.”

1010
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:52,672
“Yu’ forget I’m from the country,”
said the black-headed guy.

1011
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:55,244
“The chickens have been roostin’
a right smart while.”

1012
00:52:55,244 --> 00:52:57,952
His sunny Southern accent
was again strong.

1013
00:52:57,952 --> 00:53:04,603
In that brief passage with Trampas it had
been almost wholly absent.

1014
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:10,324
But different moods of the spirit bring
different qualities of utterance⁠—where

1015
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:12,564
a man comes by these naturally.

1016
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,323
The Virginian cashed in his checks.

1017
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:19,667
“Awhile ago,” said Steve,
“you had won three months’ salary.”

1018
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:22,857
“I’m still twenty dollars to the
good,” said the Virginian.

1019
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:24,868
“That’s better than breaking a laig.”

1020
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:30,169
Again, in some voiceless,
masonic way, most people in that saloon

1021
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:34,209
had become aware that something was
in process of happening.

1022
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:40,126
Several left their games and came to the
front by the bar.

1023
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:42,859
“If he ain’t in bed yet⁠—”
mused the Virginian.

1024
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:45,510
“I’ll find out,” said I.

1025
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,884
And I hurried across to the dim sleeping
room, happy to have a part in this.

1026
00:53:49,884 --> 00:53:53,905
They were all in bed;
and in some beds two were sleeping.

1027
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:59,733
How they could do it⁠—but in those
days I was fastidious.

1028
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:03,399
The American had come in recently
and was still awake.

1029
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:06,472
“Thought you were to sleep at the store?”

1030
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:07,567
said he.

1031
00:54:07,567 --> 00:54:10,794
So then I invented a little lie,
and explained that I was in

1032
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:12,194
search of the Virginian.

1033
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:15,148
“Better search the dives,” said he.

1034
00:54:15,148 --> 00:54:17,498
“These cowboys don’t get to town often.”

1035
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:20,789
At this point I stumbled
sharply over something.

1036
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:23,852
“It’s my box of Consumption Killer,”
explained the drummer;

1037
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:27,102
“Well, I hope that man will
stay out all night.”

1038
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:28,845
“Bed narrow?”

1039
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:29,665
I inquired.

1040
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:31,776
“For two it is.

1041
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:33,883
And the pillows are mean.

1042
00:54:33,883 --> 00:54:37,080
Takes both before you feel
anything’s under your head.”

1043
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,327
He yawned, and I wished
him pleasant dreams.

1044
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:45,786
At my news the Virginian left the bar at
once; and crossed to the sleeping room.

1045
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:51,032
Steve and I followed softly,
and behind us several more strung out

1046
00:54:51,032 --> 00:54:52,752
in an expectant line.

1047
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:54,394
“What is this going to be?”

1048
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:57,188
they inquired curiously of each other.

1049
00:54:57,188 --> 00:55:02,026
And upon learning the great novelty of
the event, they clustered with silence

1050
00:55:02,026 --> 00:55:05,775
intense outside the door where the
Virginian had gone in.

1051
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:10,310
We heard the voice of the
drummer, cautioning his bedfellow.

1052
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,310
“Don’t trip over the Killer,”
he was saying.

1053
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,906
“The Prince of Wales barked
his shin just now.”

1054
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:20,178
It seemed my English clothes had
earned me this title.

1055
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:23,258
The boots of the Virginian were
next heard to drop.

1056
00:55:23,258 --> 00:55:24,721
“Can yu’ make out what he’s at?”

1057
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:25,632
whispered Steve.

1058
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:27,127
He was plainly undressing.

1059
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:31,454
The rip of swift unbuttoning told us that
the black-headed guy must now

1060
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,253
be removing his overalls.

1061
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:35,895
“Why, thank yu’, no,”
he was replying to a

1062
00:55:35,895 --> 00:55:37,175
question of the drummer.

1063
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:39,356
“Outside or in’s all one to me.”

1064
00:55:39,356 --> 00:55:43,368
“Then, if you’d just as
soon take the wall⁠—”

1065
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:45,597
“Why, cert’nly.”

1066
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:52,682
There was a sound of bedclothes,
and creaking.

1067
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,813
“This hyeh pillo’ needs a Southern
climate,” was the Virginian’s

1068
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:58,134
next observation.

1069
00:55:58,134 --> 00:56:01,577
Many listeners had now
gathered at the door.

1070
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:04,124
The dealer and the player were both here.

1071
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:08,004
The storekeeper was present,
and I recognized the agent of the Union

1072
00:56:08,004 --> 00:56:10,044
Pacific Railroad among the crowd.

1073
00:56:10,044 --> 00:56:14,548
We made a large company,
and I felt that trembling sensation

1074
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:19,819
which is common when the cap of a camera
is about to be removed upon a group.

1075
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:24,289
“I should think,” said the drummer’s
voice, “that you’d feel your knife and

1076
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,169
gun clean through that pillow.”

1077
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:28,462
“I do,” responded the Virginian.

1078
00:56:28,462 --> 00:56:31,582
“I should think you’d put them on a
chair and be comfortable.”

1079
00:56:31,582 --> -1:59:59,000
“I’d be uncomfortable, then.

1080
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1081
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:35,212
“Used to the feel of them, I suppose?”

1082
00:56:35,212 --> 00:56:35,984
“That’s it.

1083
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:37,561
Used to the feel of them.

1084
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,593
I would miss them, and that
would make me wakeful.”

1085
00:56:40,593 --> 00:56:42,072
“Well, good night.”

1086
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:42,992
“Good night.

1087
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:48,361
If I get to talkin’ and tossin’, or
whatnot, you’ll understand you’re to⁠—”

1088
00:56:48,361 --> -1:59:59,000
“Yes, I’ll wake you.

1089
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1090
00:56:50,197 --> -1:59:59,000
“No, don’t yu’, for God’s sake!

1091
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1092
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:53,954
“Not?”

1093
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:55,926
“Don’t yu’ touch me.”

1094
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:57,577
“What’ll I do?”

1095
00:56:57,577 --> 00:56:59,417
“Roll away quick to your side.

1096
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,224
It don’t last but a minute.”

1097
00:57:01,224 --> 00:57:04,354
The Virginian spoke with
a reassuring drawl.

1098
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:09,050
Upon this there fell a brief silence,
and I heard the drummer clear his

1099
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,921
throat once or twice.

1100
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:13,003
“It’s merely the nightmare, I suppose?”

1101
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:15,785
he said after a throat clearing.

1102
00:57:15,785 --> 00:57:17,326
“Lord, yes.

1103
00:57:17,326 --> 00:57:20,977
That’s all.

1104
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:25,506
And don’t happen twice a year.

1105
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:27,511
Was you thinkin’ it was fits?”

1106
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:28,276
“Oh, no!

1107
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:29,545
I just wanted to know.

1108
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:33,682
I’ve been told before that it was not
safe for a person to be waked suddenly

1109
00:57:33,682 --> 00:57:35,357
that way out of a nightmare.”

1110
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:37,288
“Yes, I have heard that too.

1111
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:39,775
But it never harms me any.

1112
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,783
I didn’t want you to run risks.”

1113
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:43,145
“Me?”

1114
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:46,336
“Oh, it’ll be all right now that yu’
know how it is.”

1115
00:57:46,336 --> 00:57:49,096
The Virginian’s drawl
was full of assurance.

1116
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:51,999
There was a second pause,
after which the drummer said:⁠—

1117
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:53,856
“Tell me again how it is.”

1118
00:57:53,856 --> 00:57:58,650
The Virginian answered very drowsily:
“Oh, just don’t let your arm or your

1119
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,050
laig touch me if I go to jumpin’ around.

1120
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,088
I’m dreamin’ of Indians when I do that.

1121
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:07,313
And if anything touches me then,
I’m liable to grab my knife

1122
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:08,287
right in my sleep.”

1123
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:11,883
“Oh, I understand,” said the
drummer, clearing his throat.

1124
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:13,528
“Yes.”

1125
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:19,281
Steve was whispering delighted oaths to
himself, and in his joy applying to the

1126
00:58:19,281 --> 00:58:22,334
Virginian one unprintable
name after another.

1127
00:58:22,334 --> 00:58:26,487
We listened again, but now
no further words came.

1128
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:30,509
Listening very hard, I could half make
out the progress of a heavy breathing,

1129
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:32,903
and a restless turning
I could clearly detect.

1130
00:58:32,903 --> 00:58:34,874
This was the wretched drummer.

1131
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:36,245
He was waiting.

1132
00:58:36,245 --> 00:58:37,768
But he did not wait long.

1133
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:41,925
Again there was a light creak,
and after it a light step.

1134
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:45,943
He was not even going to put his boots on
in the fatal neighborhood of the

1135
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:46,653
dreamer.

1136
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:51,523
By a happy thought Medicine Bow formed
into two lines, making an

1137
00:58:51,523 --> 00:58:53,014
avenue from the door.

1138
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:57,219
And then the commercial traveller
forgot his Consumption Killer.

1139
00:58:57,219 --> 00:58:58,884
He fell heavily over it.

1140
00:58:58,884 --> 00:59:03,257
Immediately from the bed the Virginian
gave forth a dreadful howl.

1141
00:59:03,257 --> 00:59:07,718
And then everything happened at once;
and how shall mere words narrate it?

1142
00:59:07,718 --> 00:59:12,639
The door burst open, and out flew the
commercial traveller in his stockings.

1143
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,918
One hand held a lump of coat and trousers
with suspenders dangling,

1144
00:59:17,918 --> 00:59:19,857
his boots were clutched in the other.

1145
00:59:19,857 --> 00:59:22,644
The sight of us stopped his flight short.

1146
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:27,467
He gazed, the boots fell from his hand;
and at his profane explosion,

1147
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:33,634
Medicine Bow set up a united,
unearthly noise and began to play

1148
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:35,274
Virginia reel with him.

1149
00:59:35,274 --> 00:59:39,044
The other occupants of the beds had
already sprung out of them,

1150
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:42,933
clothed chiefly with their pistols,
and ready for war.

1151
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:43,846
“What is it?”

1152
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:44,994
they demanded.

1153
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:46,344
“What is it?”

1154
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:52,000
“Why, I reckon it’s drinks on Steve,”
said the Virginian from his bed.

1155
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,819
And he gave the first broad grin that I
had seen from him.

1156
00:59:57,819 --> 00:59:59,456
“I’ll set ’em up all night!”

1157
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:02,870
Steve shouted, as the
reel went on regardless.

1158
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:07,165
The drummer was bawling to be allowed to
put at least his boots on.

1159
01:00:07,165 --> 01:00:12,239
“This way, Pard,” was the answer;
and another man whirled him round.

1160
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,409
“This way, Beau!”

1161
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,008
they called to him; “This way, Budd!”

1162
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:17,811
and he was passed like a
shuttlecock down the line.

1163
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:22,070
Suddenly the leaders bounded
into the sleeping-room.

1164
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,293
“Feed the machine!”

1165
01:00:23,293 --> 01:00:23,944
they said.

1166
01:00:23,944 --> 01:00:24,900
“Feed her!”

1167
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:29,336
And seizing the German drummer who sold
jewellery, they flung him into the

1168
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:30,577
trough of the reel.

1169
01:00:30,577 --> 01:00:33,894
I saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn
to be shelled, and the

1170
01:00:33,894 --> 01:00:35,071
dance ingulfed him.

1171
01:00:35,071 --> 01:00:39,816
I saw a Jew sent rattling after him;
and next they threw in the railroad

1172
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:43,933
employee, and the other Jew;
and while I stood mesmerized,

1173
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:45,682
my own feet left the earth.

1174
01:00:45,682 --> 01:00:50,048
I shot from the room and sped like a
bobbing cork into this mill race,

1175
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:53,439
whirling my turn in the wake of the
others amid cries of,

1176
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:55,429
“Here comes the Prince of Wales!”

1177
01:00:55,429 --> 01:00:58,116
There was soon not much English
left about my raiment.

1178
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,328
They were now shouting for music.

1179
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:06,014
Medicine Bow swept in like a cloud of
dust to where a fiddler sat playing in a

1180
01:01:06,014 --> 01:01:10,086
hall; and gathering up fiddler and
dancers, swept out again,

1181
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:12,830
a larger Medicine Bow,
growing all the while.

1182
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,319
Steve offered us the freedom
of the house, everywhere.

1183
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,629
He implored us to call for whatever
pleased us, and as many times

1184
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,091
as we should please.

1185
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:26,771
He ordered the town to be searched for
more citizens to come and help

1186
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:28,066
him pay his bet.

1187
01:01:28,066 --> 01:01:31,014
But changing his mind,
kegs and bottles were now

1188
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:32,590
carried along with us.

1189
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:37,017
We had found three fiddlers,
and these played busily for us;

1190
01:01:37,017 --> 01:01:42,135
and thus we set out to visit all cabins
and houses where people might still by

1191
01:01:42,135 --> 01:01:44,015
some miracle be asleep.

1192
01:01:44,015 --> 01:01:47,100
The first man put out his head to decline.

1193
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:51,596
But such a possibility had been foreseen
by the proprietor of the store.

1194
01:01:51,596 --> 01:01:55,591
This seemingly respectable man now came
dragging some sort of apparatus from his

1195
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,568
place, helped by the Virginian.

1196
01:01:57,568 --> 01:02:00,880
The cowboys cheered, for they
knew what this was.

1197
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,264
The man in his window likewise recognized
it, and uttering a groan,

1198
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,577
came immediately out and joined us.

1199
01:02:07,577 --> 01:02:11,475
What it was, I also learned
in a few minutes.

1200
01:02:11,475 --> 01:02:15,456
For we found a house where the people
made no sign at either our

1201
01:02:15,456 --> 01:02:17,674
fiddlers or our knocking.

1202
01:02:17,674 --> 01:02:20,766
And then the infernal machine
was set to work.

1203
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:24,717
Its parts seemed to be no more than an
empty keg and a plank.

1204
01:02:24,717 --> 01:02:28,879
Some citizen informed me that I should
soon have a new idea of noise;

1205
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:32,367
and I nerved myself for something severe
in the way of gunpowder.

1206
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:36,280
But the Virginian and the proprietor now
sat on the ground holding the keg

1207
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,721
braced, and two others got down
apparently to play seesaw over the top

1208
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:42,254
of it with the plank.

1209
01:02:42,254 --> 01:02:47,451
But the keg and plank had been rubbed
with rosin, and they drew the plank back

1210
01:02:47,451 --> 01:02:49,892
and forth over the keg.

1211
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:54,962
Do you know the sound made in a narrow
street by a dray loaded

1212
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:56,309
with strips of iron?

1213
01:02:56,309 --> 01:03:03,129
That noise is a lullaby compared with the
staggering, blinding bellow which

1214
01:03:03,129 --> 01:03:04,777
rose from the keg.

1215
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:09,032
If you were to try it in your native
town, you would not merely be arrested,

1216
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,796
you would be hanged,
and everybody would be glad,

1217
01:03:11,796 --> 01:03:13,870
and the clergyman would not bury you.

1218
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:20,191
My head, my teeth, the whole system of my
bones leaped and chattered at the din,

1219
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:25,921
and out of the house like drops squirted
from a lemon came a man and his wife.

1220
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:29,415
No time was given them.

1221
01:03:29,415 --> 01:03:34,867
They were swept along with the rest;
and having been routed from their own

1222
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:38,107
bed, they now became most furious in
assailing the remaining

1223
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:40,147
homes of Medicine Bow.

1224
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:41,988
Everybody was to come out.

1225
01:03:41,988 --> 01:03:46,201
Many were now riding horses at top speed
out into the plains and back,

1226
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:49,387
while the procession of the plank and
keg continued its work,

1227
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:52,205
and the fiddlers played incessantly.

1228
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:54,236
Suddenly there was a quiet.

1229
01:03:54,236 --> 01:03:58,780
I did not see who brought the message;
but the word ran among us that there was

1230
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,912
a woman⁠—the engineer’s woman down by
the water-tank⁠—very sick.

1231
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:06,712
The doctor had been to
see her from Laramie.

1232
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:08,646
Everybody liked the engineer.

1233
01:04:08,646 --> 01:04:12,332
Plank and keg were heard no more.

1234
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:16,125
The horsemen found it out
and restrained their gambols.

1235
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,353
Medicine Bow went gradually home.

1236
01:04:19,353 --> 01:04:23,525
I saw doors shutting,
and lights go out; I saw a late few

1237
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:27,209
reassemble at the card tables,
and the drummers gathered themselves

1238
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:31,406
together for sleep; the proprietor of
the store (you could not see a more

1239
01:04:31,406 --> 01:04:35,977
respectable-looking person) hoped that I
would be comfortable on the quilts;

1240
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:40,931
and I heard Steve urging the Virginian
to take one more glass.

1241
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:44,092
“We’ve not met for so long,” he said.

1242
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:49,371
But the Virginian, the black-headed guy
who had set all this nonsense going,

1243
01:04:49,371 --> 01:04:50,733
said No to Steve.

1244
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:57,315
“I have got to stay responsible,”
was his excuse to his friend.

1245
01:04:57,315 --> 01:05:01,065
And the friend looked at me.

1246
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:07,545
Therefore I surmised that the Judge’s
trustworthy man found me an

1247
01:05:07,545 --> 01:05:10,454
embarrassment to his holiday.

1248
01:05:10,454 --> 01:05:13,309
But if he did, he never showed it to me.

1249
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:19,713
He had been sent to meet a stranger and
drive him to Sunk Creek in safety,

1250
01:05:19,713 --> 01:05:23,083
and this charge he would allow
no temptation to imperil.

1251
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:25,100
He nodded good night to me.

1252
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,837
“If there’s anything I can do for
yu’, you’ll tell me.”

1253
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:29,201
I thanked him.

1254
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,423
“What a pleasant evening!”

1255
01:05:31,423 --> 01:05:32,143
I added.

1256
01:05:32,143 --> -1:59:59,000
“I’m glad yu’ found it so.

1257
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1258
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:38,078
Again his manner put a
bar to my approaches.

1259
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:42,208
Even though I had seen him wildly
disporting himself, those were matters

1260
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:44,406
which he chose not to discuss with me.

1261
01:05:44,406 --> 01:05:49,076
Medicine Bow was quiet as I went my
way to my quilts.

1262
01:05:49,076 --> 01:05:55,793
So still, that through the air the deep
whistles of the freight trains came from

1263
01:05:55,793 --> 01:06:00,758
below the horizon across
great miles of silence.

1264
01:06:00,758 --> 01:06:05,128
I passed cowboys, whom half an hour
before I had seen prancing and roaring,

1265
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:10,136
now rolled in their blankets beneath the
open and shining night.

1266
01:06:10,136 --> 01:06:11,256
“What world am I in?”

1267
01:06:11,256 --> 01:06:12,424
I said aloud.

1268
01:06:12,424 --> 01:06:14,696
“Does this same planet hold Fifth Avenue?”

1269
01:06:14,696 --> 01:06:17,960
And I went to sleep, pondering
over my native land.

1270
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:18,890
CHAPTER IV

1271
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,749
Deep Into Cattle Land

1272
01:06:20,749 --> 01:06:26,579
Morning had been for some while astir in
Medicine Bow before I left my quilts.

1273
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:31,311
The new day and its doings began around
me in the store, chiefly

1274
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:32,892
at the grocery counter.

1275
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:35,801
Dry-goods were not in great request.

1276
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:40,484
The early rising cowboys were off again
to their work; and those to whom their

1277
01:06:40,484 --> 01:06:45,695
night’s holiday had left any dollars
were spending these for tobacco,

1278
01:06:45,695 --> 01:06:50,300
or cartridges, or canned provisions for
the journey to their distant camps.

1279
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:55,328
Sardines were called for,
and potted chicken, and devilled ham:

1280
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:59,039
a sophisticated nourishment,
at first sight, for these

1281
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,259
sons of the sagebrush.

1282
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:06,060
But portable ready-made food plays of
necessity a great part in the opening

1283
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,105
of a new country.

1284
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:12,222
These picnic pots and cans were the first
of her trophies that Civilization

1285
01:07:12,222 --> 01:07:16,584
dropped upon Wyoming’s virgin soil.

1286
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:20,160
The cowboy is now gone to worlds
invisible; the wind has blown away the

1287
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:24,250
white ashes of his campfires;
but the empty sardine box lies rusting

1288
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,801
over the face of the Western earth.

1289
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:32,176
So through my eyes half closed I watched
the sale of these tins,

1290
01:07:32,176 --> 01:07:36,016
and grew familiar with the ham’s
inevitable trademark⁠—that label with

1291
01:07:36,016 --> 01:07:40,681
the devil and his horns and hoofs and
tail very pronounced,

1292
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:46,297
all colored a sultry prodigious scarlet.

1293
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:51,462
And when each horseman had made his
purchase, he would trail his spurs over

1294
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:56,348
the floor, and presently the sound of
his horse’s hoofs would be

1295
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:57,423
the last of him.

1296
01:07:57,423 --> 01:08:02,428
Through my dozing attention came various
fragments of talk, and sometimes

1297
01:08:02,428 --> 01:08:04,367
useful bits of knowledge.

1298
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:10,932
For instance, I learned the true value of
tomatoes in this country.

1299
01:08:10,932 --> 01:08:13,338
One fellow was buying two cans of them.

1300
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:15,255
“Meadow Creek dry already?”

1301
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:17,298
commented the proprietor.

1302
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:21,496
“Been dry ten days,” the
young cowboy informed him.

1303
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:26,366
And it appeared that along the road he
was going, water would not be reached

1304
01:08:26,366 --> 01:08:29,854
much before sundown,
because this Meadow Creek

1305
01:08:29,854 --> 01:08:31,242
had ceased to run.

1306
01:08:31,242 --> 01:08:33,445
His tomatoes were for drink.

1307
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:38,632
And thus they have refreshed
me many times since.

1308
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:39,632
“No beer?”

1309
01:08:39,632 --> 01:08:41,257
suggested the proprietor.

1310
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:43,171
The boy made a shuddering face.

1311
01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:45,346
“Don’t say its name to me!”

1312
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:46,634
he exclaimed.

1313
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:49,019
“I couldn’t hold my breakfast down.”

1314
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:51,793
He rang his silver money upon the counter.

1315
01:08:51,793 --> 01:08:55,073
“I’ve swore off for three
months,” he stated.

1316
01:08:55,073 --> 01:08:57,116
“I’m going to be as pure as the snow!”

1317
01:08:57,116 --> 01:09:01,840
And away he went jingling out of the
door, to ride seventy-five miles.

1318
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,821
Three more months of hard,
unsheltered work, and he would ride into

1319
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:09,866
town again, with his adolescent blood
crying aloud for its own.

1320
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:14,503
“I’m obliged,” said a new voice,
rousing me from a new doze.

1321
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:17,015
“She’s easier this morning,
since the medicine.”

1322
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:20,728
This was the engineer,
whose sick wife had brought a hush

1323
01:09:20,728 --> 01:09:22,745
over Medicine Bow’s rioting.

1324
01:09:22,745 --> 01:09:27,293
“I’ll give her them flowers soon as
she wakes,” he added.

1325
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,968
“Flowers?”

1326
01:09:28,968 --> 01:09:31,168
repeated the proprietor.

1327
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,529
“You didn’t leave that bunch at our door?”

1328
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:35,350
“Wish I’d thought to do it.”

1329
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,274
“She likes to see flowers,”
said the engineer.

1330
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,058
And he walked out slowly,
with his thanks unachieved.

1331
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:47,579
He returned at once with the Virginian;
for in the band of the Virginian’s hat

1332
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:50,446
were two or three blossoms.

1333
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:54,181
“It don’t need mentioning,”
the Southerner was saying,

1334
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:57,186
embarrassed by any expression of thanks.

1335
01:09:57,186 --> 01:09:58,741
“If we had knowed last night⁠—”

1336
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:01,570
“You didn’t disturb her any,”
broke in the engineer.

1337
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:04,140
“She’s easier this morning.

1338
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,601
I’ll tell her about them flowers.”

1339
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:10,842
“Why, it don’t need mentioning,”
the Virginian again protested,

1340
01:10:10,842 --> 01:10:11,782
almost crossly.

1341
01:10:11,782 --> 01:10:15,543
“The little things looked kind o’ fresh,
and I just picked them.”

1342
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:19,742
His eye now fell upon me,
where I lay upon the counter.

1343
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:23,451
“I reckon breakfast will be
getting through,” he remarked.

1344
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:25,422
I was soon at the wash trough.

1345
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:29,812
It was only half-past six,
but many had been before me⁠—one glance

1346
01:10:29,812 --> 01:10:31,558
at the roller-towel told me that.

1347
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:35,172
I was afraid to ask the landlady for a
clean one, and so I found a fresh

1348
01:10:35,172 --> 01:10:37,795
handkerchief, and accomplished
a sparing toilet.

1349
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:43,726
In the midst of this the drummers joined
me, one by one, and they used the

1350
01:10:43,726 --> 01:10:46,571
degraded towel without hesitation.

1351
01:10:46,571 --> 01:10:50,000
In a way they had the best of me;
filth was nothing to them.

1352
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,806
The latest risers in Medicine Bow,
we sat at breakfast together;

1353
01:10:53,806 --> 01:10:57,086
and they essayed some light
familiarities with the landlady.

1354
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,147
But these experiments were failures.

1355
01:11:00,147 --> 01:11:03,919
Her eyes did not see,
nor did her ears hear them.

1356
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:09,335
She brought the coffee and the bacon with
a sedateness that propriety itself

1357
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:11,601
could scarce have surpassed.

1358
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:17,295
Yet impropriety lurked
noiselessly all over her.

1359
01:11:17,295 --> 01:11:22,193
You could not have specified how;
it was interblended with her sum total.

1360
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:28,779
Silence was her apparent habit and her
weapon; but the American drummer found

1361
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:32,939
that she could speak to the point when
need came for this.

1362
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:36,918
During the meal he had
praised her golden hair.

1363
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,730
It was golden indeed,
and worth a high compliment;

1364
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,562
but his kind displeased her.

1365
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:47,337
She had let it pass, however,
with no more than a cool stare.

1366
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:51,159
But on taking his leave,
when he came to pay for the meal,

1367
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:52,688
he pushed it too far.

1368
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:56,097
“Pity this must be our last,”
he said; and as it brought

1369
01:11:56,097 --> 01:11:58,505
no answer, “Ever travel?”

1370
01:11:58,505 --> 01:11:59,350
he inquired.

1371
01:11:59,350 --> -1:59:59,000
“Where I go, there’s room for
a pair of us.

1372
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1373
01:12:02,593 --> 01:12:06,985
“Then you’d better find another
jackass,” she replied quietly.

1374
01:12:06,985 --> 01:12:10,447
I was glad that I had not asked
for a clean towel.

1375
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:14,356
From the commercial travellers I now
separated myself, and wandered

1376
01:12:14,356 --> 01:12:16,798
alone in pleasurable aimlessness.

1377
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:19,474
It was seven o’clock.

1378
01:12:19,474 --> 01:12:23,285
Medicine Bow stood voiceless
and unpeopled.

1379
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,492
The cowboys had melted away.

1380
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:29,452
The inhabitants were indoors,
pursuing the business or the

1381
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:31,436
idleness of the forenoon.

1382
01:12:31,436 --> 01:12:33,740
Visible motion there was none.

1383
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:38,246
No shell upon the dry sands could lie
more lifeless than Medicine Bow.

1384
01:12:38,246 --> 01:12:41,515
Looking in at the store,
I saw the proprietor sitting

1385
01:12:41,515 --> 01:12:42,980
with his pipe extinct.

1386
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,786
Looking in at the saloon,
I saw the dealer dealing

1387
01:12:46,786 --> 01:12:48,047
dumbly to himself.

1388
01:12:48,047 --> 01:12:52,956
Up in the sky there was not a cloud nor a
bird, and on the earth the

1389
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:56,796
lightest straw lay becalmed.

1390
01:12:56,796 --> 01:13:02,641
Once I saw the Virginian at an open door,
where the golden-haired landlady

1391
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:03,937
stood talking with him.

1392
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:08,421
Sometimes I strolled in the town,
and sometimes out on the plain I lay

1393
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:11,279
down with my day dreams in the
sagebrush.

1394
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:15,602
Pale herds of antelope were in the
distance, and near by the demure

1395
01:13:15,602 --> 01:13:18,554
prairie-dogs sat up and scrutinized me.

1396
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:21,178
Steve, Trampas, the riot of horsemen,
my lost trunk, Uncle Hughey,

1397
01:13:21,178 --> 01:13:23,378
with his abortive brides⁠—all things
merged in my thoughts in

1398
01:13:23,378 --> 01:13:23,378
a huge, delicious indifference.

1399
01:13:23,378 --> 01:13:25,723
It was like swimming slowly at random in
an ocean that was smooth,

1400
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:27,977
and neither too cool nor too warm.

1401
01:13:27,977 --> 01:13:31,843
And before I knew it,
five lazy imperceptible

1402
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:34,352
hours had gone thus.

1403
01:13:34,352 --> 01:13:40,320
There was the Union Pacific train,
coming as if from shores forgotten.

1404
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,502
Its approach was silent
and long drawn out.

1405
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,862
I easily reached town and the platform
before it had finished

1406
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:48,163
watering at the tank.

1407
01:13:48,163 --> 01:13:52,749
It moved up, made a short halt,
I saw my trunk come out of it,

1408
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:58,104
and then it moved away silently as it
had come, smoking and

1409
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:00,674
dwindling into distance unknown.

1410
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:05,487
Beside my trunk was one other,
tied extravagantly with white ribbon.

1411
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:09,074
The fluttering bows caught my attention,
and now I suddenly saw

1412
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,995
a perfectly new sight.

1413
01:14:10,995 --> 01:14:14,995
The Virginian was further down the
platform, doubled up with laughing.

1414
01:14:14,995 --> 01:14:19,455
It was good to know that with sufficient
cause he could laugh like this;

1415
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,026
a smile had thus far been his
limit of external mirth.

1416
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:28,693
Rice now flew against my hat,
and hissing gusts of rice

1417
01:14:28,693 --> 01:14:30,831
spouted on the platform.

1418
01:14:30,831 --> 01:14:34,726
All the men left in Medicine Bow appeared
like magic, and more

1419
01:14:34,726 --> 01:14:36,621
rice choked the atmosphere.

1420
01:14:36,621 --> 01:14:40,377
Through the general clamor a cracked
voice said, “Don’t hit her

1421
01:14:40,377 --> 01:14:41,619
in the eye, boys!”

1422
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:46,518
and Uncle Hughey rushed proudly by me
with an actual wife on his arm.

1423
01:14:46,518 --> 01:14:49,044
She could easily have
been his granddaughter.

1424
01:14:49,044 --> 01:14:51,820
They got at once into a vehicle.

1425
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,712
The trunk was lifted in behind.

1426
01:14:54,712 --> 01:14:59,289
And amid cheers, rice,
shoes, and broad felicitations,

1427
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:03,435
the pair drove out of town,
Uncle Hughey shrieking to the horses and

1428
01:15:03,435 --> 01:15:06,764
the bride waving unabashed adieus.

1429
01:15:06,764 --> 01:15:10,125
The word had come over the wires from
Laramie: “Uncle Hughey has

1430
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,158
made it this time.

1431
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:13,540
Expect him on today’s number two.”

1432
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,727
And Medicine Bow had expected him.

1433
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:18,834
Many words arose on the departure of
the new-married couple.

1434
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:19,611
“Who’s she?”

1435
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:20,888
“What’s he got for her?”

1436
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:23,513
“Got a gold mine up Bear Creek.”

1437
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:28,333
And after comment and prophecy,
Medicine Bow returned to its dinner.

1438
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:31,135
This meal was my last here
for a long while.

1439
01:15:31,135 --> 01:15:34,841
The Virginian’s responsibility now
returned; duty drove the Judge’s

1440
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:38,093
trustworthy man to take care of me
again.

1441
01:15:38,093 --> 01:15:42,875
He had not once sought my society of his
own accord; his distaste for what he

1442
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:48,720
supposed me to be (I don’t exactly know
what this was) remained unshaken.

1443
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,444
I have thought that matters of dress and
speech should not carry with them so

1444
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:58,185
much mistrust in our democracy;
thieves are presumed innocent until

1445
01:15:58,185 --> 01:16:02,504
proved guilty, but a starched collar
is condemned at once.

1446
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:05,846
Perfect civility and obligingness I
certainly did receive from the

1447
01:16:05,846 --> 01:16:08,303
Virginian, only not a word of
fellowship.

1448
01:16:08,303 --> 01:16:13,570
He harnessed the horses,
got my trunk, and gave me some advice

1449
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:18,250
about taking provisions for our journey,
something more palatable than what food

1450
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,234
we should find along the road.

1451
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:24,152
It was well thought of,
and I bought quite a parcel of dainties,

1452
01:16:24,152 --> 01:16:28,773
feeling that he would despise
both them and me.

1453
01:16:28,773 --> 01:16:32,733
And thus I took my seat beside him,
wondering what we should manage to talk

1454
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:36,042
about for two hundred
and sixty-three miles.

1455
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:40,114
Farewell in those days was not
said in Cattle Land.

1456
01:16:40,114 --> 01:16:44,342
Acquaintances watched our departure with
a nod or with nothing,

1457
01:16:44,342 --> 01:16:50,156
and the nearest approach to “Goodbye”
was the proprietor’s “So-long.”

1458
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:53,728
But I caught sight of one
farewell given without words.

1459
01:16:53,728 --> 01:16:58,060
As we drove by the eating-house,
the shade of a side window was raised,

1460
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,819
and the landlady looked her
last upon the Virginian.

1461
01:17:00,819 --> 01:17:05,307
Her lips were faintly parted,
and no woman’s eyes ever said more

1462
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:07,928
plainly, “I am one of your possessions.”

1463
01:17:07,928 --> 01:17:10,223
She had forgotten that it might be seen.

1464
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:12,483
Her glance caught mine,
and she backed into the

1465
01:17:12,483 --> 01:17:13,664
dimness of the room.

1466
01:17:13,664 --> 01:17:19,043
What look she may have received from him,
if he gave her any at this too public

1467
01:17:19,043 --> 01:17:21,078
moment, I could not tell.

1468
01:17:21,078 --> 01:17:25,523
His eyes seemed to be upon the horses,
and he drove with the same mastering

1469
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:28,336
ease that had roped the
wild pony yesterday.

1470
01:17:28,336 --> 01:17:34,217
We passed the ramparts of Medicine Bow⁠—
thick heaps and fringes of tin cans,

1471
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:38,821
and shelving mounds of bottles cast
out of the saloons.

1472
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,054
The sun struck these at
a hundred glittering points.

1473
01:17:42,054 --> 01:17:47,182
And in a moment we were in the clean
plains, with the prairie-dogs and the

1474
01:17:47,182 --> 01:17:48,893
pale herds of antelope.

1475
01:17:48,893 --> 01:17:55,429
The great, still air bathed us,
pure as water and strong as wine;

1476
01:17:55,429 --> 01:17:58,869
the sunlight flooded the world;
and shining upon the breast of the

1477
01:17:58,869 --> 01:18:03,885
Virginian’s flannel shirt lay a long
gold thread of hair!

1478
01:18:03,885 --> 01:18:09,112
The noisy American drummer had met
defeat, but this silent free lance

1479
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:11,301
had been easily victorious.

1480
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:15,502
It must have been five miles that we
travelled in silence,

1481
01:18:15,502 --> 01:18:20,418
losing and seeing the horizon among the
ceaseless waves of the earth.

1482
01:18:20,418 --> 01:18:24,105
Then I looked back, and there was
Medicine Bow, seemingly a

1483
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:26,048
stone’s throw behind us.

1484
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:30,766
It was a full half-hour before I looked
back again, and there sure enough

1485
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:32,683
was always Medicine Bow.

1486
01:18:32,683 --> 01:18:37,539
A size or two smaller,
I will admit, but visible in every

1487
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:41,983
feature, like something seen through the
wrong end of a field glass.

1488
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:46,440
The Eastbound express was approaching the
town, and I noticed the white steam from

1489
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,081
its whistle; but when the sound reached
us, the train had almost stopped.

1490
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:55,133
And in reply to my comment upon this,
the Virginian deigned to remark that it

1491
01:18:55,133 --> 01:18:57,293
was more so in Arizona.

1492
01:18:57,293 --> 01:19:02,609
“A man come to Arizona,”
he said, “with one of them telescopes to

1493
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:04,561
study the heavenly bodies.

1494
01:19:04,561 --> 01:19:08,106
He was a Yankee, seh,
and a right smart one, too.

1495
01:19:08,106 --> 01:19:12,983
And one night we was watchin’ for some
little old fallin’ stars that he said

1496
01:19:12,983 --> 01:19:17,742
was due, and I saw some lights movin’
along across the mesa pretty lively,

1497
01:19:17,742 --> 01:19:19,013
an’ I sang out.

1498
01:19:19,013 --> 01:19:21,828
But he told me it was just the train.

1499
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:26,424
And I told him I didn’t know yu’ could
see the cyars that plain from his place,

1500
01:19:26,424 --> 01:19:30,157
‘Yu’ can see them,’ he said to me,
‘but it is las’ night’s

1501
01:19:30,157 --> -1:59:59,000
cyars you’re lookin’ at.’

1502
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1503
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:35,830
At this point the Virginian spoke
severely to one of the horses.

1504
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:39,230
“Of course,” he then resumed to me,
“that Yankee man did not mean quite all

1505
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,910
he said.⁠—You, Buck!”

1506
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,953
he again broke off suddenly to the horse.

1507
01:19:42,953 --> 01:19:47,350
“But Arizona, seh,” he continued,
“it cert’nly has a mos’

1508
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:49,049
deceivin’ atmospheah.

1509
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:52,830
Another man told me he had seen a lady
close one eye at him when he was two

1510
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,270
minutes hard run from her.”

1511
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,313
This time the Virginian
gave Buck the whip.

1512
01:19:57,313 --> 01:20:02,303
“What effect,” I inquired with a gravity
equal to his own, “does this

1513
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:06,038
extraordinary foreshortening have upon
a quart of whiskey?”

1514
01:20:06,038 --> 01:20:10,995
“When it’s outside yu’, seh,
no distance looks too far to go to it.”

1515
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:16,533
He glanced at me with an eye that held
more confidence than hitherto he had

1516
01:20:16,533 --> 01:20:18,213
been able to feel in me.

1517
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:21,571
I had made one step in his approval.

1518
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:23,766
But I had many yet to go.

1519
01:20:23,766 --> 01:20:28,892
This day he preferred his own thoughts to
my conversation, and so he did all the

1520
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:32,172
days of this first journey;
while I should have greatly preferred

1521
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:34,183
his conversation to my thoughts.

1522
01:20:34,183 --> 01:20:39,567
He dismissed some attempts that I made
upon the subject of Uncle Hughey so that

1523
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:44,965
I had not the courage to touch upon
Trampas, and that chill brief collision

1524
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,937
which might have struck
the spark of death.

1525
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:49,007
Trampas!

1526
01:20:49,007 --> 01:20:53,477
I had forgotten him till this silent
drive I was beginning.

1527
01:20:53,477 --> 01:20:59,011
I wondered if I should ever see him,
or Steve, or any of those people again.

1528
01:20:59,011 --> 01:21:01,878
And this wonder I expressed aloud.

1529
01:21:01,878 --> 01:21:03,811
“There’s no tellin’ in this country

1530
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:04,837
,” said the Virginian.

1531
01:21:04,837 --> 01:21:07,503
“Folks come easy, and they go easy.

1532
01:21:07,503 --> 01:21:11,617
In settled places, like back in the
States, even a poor man

1533
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,217
mostly has a home.

1534
01:21:13,217 --> 01:21:17,497
Don’t care if it’s only a barrel on a
lot, the fello’ will keep frequentin’

1535
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,417
that lot, and if yu’ want him
yu’ can find him.

1536
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,497
But out hyeh in the sagebrush,
a man’s home is apt to

1537
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:24,780
be his saddle blanket.

1538
01:21:24,780 --> -1:59:59,000
First thing yu’ know,
he has moved it to Texas.

1539
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1540
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:32,074
“You have done some moving
yourself,” I suggested.

1541
01:21:32,074 --> 01:21:35,123
But this word closed his mouth.

1542
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:39,868
“I have had a look at the country,”
he said, and we were silent again.

1543
01:21:39,868 --> 01:21:43,770
Let me, however, tell you here that he
had set out for a “look at the country”

1544
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,779
at the age of fourteen;
and that by his present age of twenty-

1545
01:21:46,779 --> 01:21:52,523
four he had seen Arkansas,
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,

1546
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:57,890
California, Oregon, Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming.

1547
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:03,247
Everywhere he had taken care of himself,
and survived; nor had his strong heart

1548
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:06,346
yet waked up to any hunger for a home.

1549
01:22:06,346 --> 01:22:10,819
Let me also tell you that he was one of
thousands drifting and living thus,

1550
01:22:10,819 --> 01:22:14,960
but (as you shall learn)
one in a thousand.

1551
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:20,025
Medicine Bow did not forever
remain in sight.

1552
01:22:20,025 --> 01:22:24,865
When next I thought of it and looked
behind, nothing was there but the road

1553
01:22:24,865 --> 01:22:30,637
we had come; it lay like a ship’s wake
across the huge ground

1554
01:22:30,637 --> 01:22:32,459
swell of the earth.

1555
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:35,381
We were swallowed in a vast solitude.

1556
01:22:35,381 --> 01:22:38,459
A little while before sunset,
a cabin came in view;

1557
01:22:38,459 --> 01:22:40,579
and here we passed our first night.

1558
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:44,085
Two young men lived here,
tending their cattle.

1559
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:45,952
They were fond of animals.

1560
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:51,677
By the stable a chained coyote rushed
nervously in a circle,

1561
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:57,233
or sat on its haunches and snapped at
gifts of food ungraciously.

1562
01:22:57,233 --> 01:23:01,713
A tame young elk walked in and out of the
cabin door, and during supper it tried

1563
01:23:01,713 --> 01:23:03,443
to push me off my chair.

1564
01:23:03,443 --> 01:23:08,926
A half-tame mountain sheep practised
jumping from the ground to the roof.

1565
01:23:08,926 --> 01:23:16,746
The cabin was papered with posters of a
circus, and skins of bear and silver fox

1566
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:18,157
lay upon the floor.

1567
01:23:18,157 --> 01:23:22,794
Until nine o’clock one man talked to the
Virginian, and one played gayly upon a

1568
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:26,430
concertina; and then we all went to bed.

1569
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:30,703
The air was like December,
but in my blankets and a buffalo robe I

1570
01:23:30,703 --> 01:23:34,228
kept warm, and luxuriated in
the Rocky Mountain silence.

1571
01:23:34,228 --> 01:23:37,969
Going to wash before breakfast at
sunrise, I found needles of

1572
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,044
ice in a pail.

1573
01:23:39,044 --> 01:23:44,722
Yet it was hard to remember that this
quiet, open, splendid wilderness (with

1574
01:23:44,722 --> 01:23:50,706
not a peak in sight just here) was
six thousand feet high.

1575
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:55,117
And when breakfast was over there was no
December left; and by the time the

1576
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:59,164
Virginian and I were ten miles upon our
way, it was June.

1577
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:04,667
But always every breath that I breathed
was pure as water and strong as wine.

1578
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:07,234
We never passed a human being this day.

1579
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:12,894
Some wild cattle rushed up to us and away
from us; antelope stared at us from a

1580
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:18,124
hundred yards; coyotes ran skulking
through the sagebrush to watch us from a

1581
01:24:18,124 --> 01:24:22,605
hill; at our noon meal we killed a
rattlesnake and shot some young sage

1582
01:24:22,605 --> 01:24:27,565
chickens, which were good at supper,
roasted at our campfire.

1583
01:24:27,565 --> 01:24:34,361
By half-past eight we were asleep beneath
the stars, and by half-past four I was

1584
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:36,390
drinking coffee and shivering.

1585
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:41,957
The horse, Buck, was hard to
catch this second morning.

1586
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:47,075
Whether some hills that we were now in
had excited him, or whether the better

1587
01:24:47,075 --> 01:24:49,515
water up here had caused an
effervescence in his

1588
01:24:49,515 --> 01:24:51,517
spirits, I cannot say.

1589
01:24:51,517 --> 01:24:56,149
But I was as hot as July by the time we
had him safe in harness,

1590
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:58,939
or, rather, unsafe in harness.

1591
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:04,554
For Buck, in the mysterious language of
horses, now taught wickedness to his

1592
01:25:04,554 --> 01:25:09,867
side partner, and about eleven o’clock
they laid their evil heads together and

1593
01:25:09,867 --> 01:25:13,079
decided to break our necks.

1594
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:18,330
We were passing, I have said,
through a range of demi-mountains.

1595
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:24,295
It was a little country where trees grew,
water ran, and the plains were shut

1596
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:25,359
out for a while.

1597
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,855
The road had steep places in it,
and places here and there where you

1598
01:25:28,855 --> 01:25:33,833
could fall off and go bounding to
the bottom among stones.

1599
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:38,667
But Buck, for some reason,
did not think these opportunities

1600
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:39,726
good enough for him.

1601
01:25:39,726 --> 01:25:42,907
He selected a more theatrical moment.

1602
01:25:42,907 --> 01:25:51,312
We emerged from a narrow canyon suddenly
upon five hundred cattle and some

1603
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,772
cowboys branding calves by a
fire in a corral.

1604
01:25:54,772 --> 01:25:57,822
It was a sight that Buck knew by heart.

1605
01:25:57,822 --> 01:26:00,873
He instantly treated it
like an appalling phenomenon.

1606
01:26:00,873 --> 01:26:06,192
I saw him kick seven ways;
I saw Muggins kick five ways;

1607
01:26:06,192 --> 01:26:10,695
our furious motion snapped my
spine like a whip.

1608
01:26:10,695 --> 01:26:12,487
I grasped the seat.

1609
01:26:12,487 --> 01:26:14,586
Something gave a forlorn jingle.

1610
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:15,946
It was the brake.

1611
01:26:15,946 --> 01:26:17,042
“Don’t jump!”

1612
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,834
commanded the trustworthy man.

1613
01:26:18,834 --> 01:26:23,067
“No,” I said, as my hat flew off.

1614
01:26:23,067 --> 01:26:26,771
Help was too far away to
do anything for us.

1615
01:26:26,771 --> 01:26:31,454
We passed scatheless through a part of
the cattle, I saw their horns

1616
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:32,792
and backs go by.

1617
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:37,076
Some earth crumbled, and we plunged
downward into water rocking among

1618
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:41,290
stones, and upward again through
some more crumbling earth.

1619
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:45,632
I heard a crash, and saw my trunk
landing in the stream.

1620
01:26:45,632 --> 01:26:48,573
“She’s safer there,” said
the trustworthy man.

1621
01:26:48,573 --> 01:26:50,233
“True,” I said.

1622
01:26:50,233 --> 01:26:54,003
“We’ll go back for her,”
said he, with his eye on the horses and

1623
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:55,843
his foot on the crippled brake.

1624
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:59,029
A dry gully was coming,
and no room to turn.

1625
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:02,831
The farther side of it
was terraced with rock.

1626
01:27:02,831 --> 01:27:07,325
We should simply fall backward,
if we did not fall forward first.

1627
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:11,448
He steered the horses straight over,
and just at the bottom swung them,

1628
01:27:11,448 --> 01:27:15,323
with astonishing skill,
to the right along the hard-baked mud.

1629
01:27:15,323 --> 01:27:18,768
They took us along the bed up to the head
of the gully, and through a

1630
01:27:18,768 --> 01:27:20,748
thicket of quaking asps.

1631
01:27:20,748 --> 01:27:24,910
The light trees bent beneath our charge
and bastinadoed the wagon as

1632
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,242
it went over them.

1633
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:30,321
But their branches enmeshed the horses’
legs, and we came to a harmless

1634
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:33,788
standstill among a bower of leaves.

1635
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:36,913
I looked at the trustworthy
man, and smiled vaguely.

1636
01:27:36,913 --> 01:27:39,172
He considered me for a moment.

1637
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:44,539
“I reckon,” said he, “you’re feelin’
about halfway between ‘Oh, Lord!’

1638
01:27:44,539 --> -1:59:59,000
and ‘Thank God!’

1639
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1640
01:27:46,036 --> 01:27:49,292
“That’s quite it,” said I,
as he got down on the ground.

1641
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:54,106
“Nothing’s broke,” said he,
after a searching examination.

1642
01:27:54,106 --> 01:27:58,415
And he indulged in a true
Virginian expletive.

1643
01:27:58,415 --> 01:27:59,741
“Gentlemen, hush!”

1644
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:03,870
he murmured gently, looking at me with
his grave eyes; “one time I

1645
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,390
got pretty near scared.

1646
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:10,863
You, Buck,” he continued,
“some folks would beat you now till yu’d

1647
01:28:10,863 --> 01:28:15,752
be uncertain whether yu’ was a hawss
or a railroad accident.

1648
01:28:15,752 --> -1:59:59,000
I’d do it myself, only
it wouldn’t cure yu’.

1649
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1650
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:25,643
I now told him that I supposed he had
saved both our lives.

1651
01:28:25,643 --> 01:28:29,089
But he detested words of direct praise.

1652
01:28:29,089 --> 01:28:34,030
He made some grumbling rejoinder,
and led the horses out of the thicket.

1653
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:38,726
Buck, he explained to me,
was a good horse, and so was Muggins.

1654
01:28:38,726 --> 01:28:41,086
Both of them generally
meant well, and that

1655
01:28:41,086 --> 01:28:43,683
was the Judge’s reason for sending
them to meet me.

1656
01:28:43,683 --> 01:28:47,519
But these broncos had their off days.

1657
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:53,249
Off days might not come very often;
but when the humor seized a bronco,

1658
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:55,306
he had to have his spree.

1659
01:28:55,306 --> 01:28:59,567
Buck would now behave himself as a horse
should for probably two months.

1660
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:03,135
“They are just like humans,”
the Virginian concluded.

1661
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:08,598
Several cowboys arrived on a gallop to
find how many pieces of us were left.

1662
01:29:08,598 --> 01:29:12,424
We returned down the hill;
and when we reached my trunk,

1663
01:29:12,424 --> 01:29:18,352
it was surprising to see the distance
that our runaway had covered.

1664
01:29:18,352 --> 01:29:22,008
My hat was also found,
and we continued on our way.

1665
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:25,811
Buck and Muggins were patterns of
discretion through the

1666
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:27,330
rest of the mountains.

1667
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:31,283
I thought when we camped this night that
it was strange Buck should be again

1668
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:35,298
allowed to graze at large,
instead of being tied to a

1669
01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:37,839
rope while we slept.

1670
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:40,139
But this was my ignorance.

1671
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:44,620
With the hard work that he was gallantly
doing, the horse needed more pasture

1672
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,321
than a rope’s length would
permit him to find.

1673
01:29:47,321 --> 01:29:51,528
Therefore he went free,
and in the morning gave us but little

1674
01:29:51,528 --> 01:29:53,360
trouble in catching him.

1675
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,187
We crossed a river in the forenoon,
and far to the north of us we saw the

1676
01:29:58,187 --> 01:30:01,567
Bow Leg Mountains, pale
in the bright sun.

1677
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:06,072
Sunk Creek flowed from their western
side, and our two hundred and sixty-

1678
01:30:06,072 --> 01:30:10,104
three miles began to grow a small
thing in my eyes.

1679
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:13,184
Buck and Muggins, I think,
knew perfectly that tomorrow

1680
01:30:13,184 --> 01:30:14,263
would see them home.

1681
01:30:14,263 --> 01:30:17,064
They recognized this region;
and once they turned off at a

1682
01:30:17,064 --> 01:30:18,192
fork in the road.

1683
01:30:18,192 --> 01:30:20,948
The Virginian pulled them
back rather sharply.

1684
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:23,260
“Want to go back to Balaam’s?”

1685
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,679
he inquired of them.

1686
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:26,758
“I thought you had more sense.”

1687
01:30:26,758 --> 01:30:30,345
I asked, “Who was Balaam?”

1688
01:30:30,345 --> 01:30:33,631
“A maltreater of hawsses,”
replied the cowpuncher.

1689
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:36,225
“His ranch is on Butte Creek oveh yondeh.”

1690
01:30:36,225 --> 01:30:40,486
And he pointed to where the diverging
road melted into space.

1691
01:30:40,486 --> 01:30:43,786
“The Judge bought Buck and Muggins from
him in the spring.”

1692
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:45,659
“So he maltreats horses?”

1693
01:30:45,659 --> 01:30:46,476
I repeated.

1694
01:30:46,476 --> 01:30:49,109
“That’s the word all through this country.

1695
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:53,526
A man that will do what they claim Balaam
does to a hawss when he’s mad,

1696
01:30:53,526 --> 01:30:55,126
ain’t fit to be called human.”

1697
01:30:55,126 --> 01:30:57,407
The Virginian told me some particulars.

1698
01:30:57,407 --> 01:30:57,971
“Oh!”

1699
01:30:57,971 --> 01:31:02,292
I almost screamed at the horror of
it, and again, “Oh!”

1700
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:05,652
“He’d have prob’ly done that to Buck as
soon as he stopped runnin’ away.

1701
01:31:05,652 --> 01:31:08,524
If I caught a man doin’ that⁠—”

1702
01:31:08,524 --> 01:31:12,205
We were interrupted by a sedate-looking
traveller riding upon

1703
01:31:12,205 --> 01:31:13,858
an equally sober horse.

1704
01:31:13,858 --> 01:31:18,081
“Mawnin’, Taylor,” said the Virginian,
pulling up for gossip.

1705
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:20,852
“Ain’t you strayed off
your range pretty far?”

1706
01:31:20,852 --> 01:31:22,007
“You’re a nice one!”

1707
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:26,919
replied Mr. Taylor, stopping his
horse and smiling amiably.

1708
01:31:26,919 --> 01:31:30,191
“Tell me something I don’t
know,” retorted the Virginian.

1709
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:34,802
“Hold up a man at cards and rob
him,” pursued Mr. Taylor.

1710
01:31:34,802 --> 01:31:36,656
“Oh, the news has got ahead of you!”

1711
01:31:36,656 --> 01:31:39,141
“Trampas has been hyeh
explainin’, has he?”

1712
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:40,725
said the Virginian with a grin.

1713
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:42,474
“Was that your victim’s name?”

1714
01:31:42,474 --> 01:31:44,712
said Mr. Taylor, facetiously.

1715
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:47,389
“No, it wasn’t him that brought the news.

1716
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:49,732
Say, what did you do, anyway?”

1717
01:31:49,732 --> 01:31:53,371
“So that thing has got
around,” murmured the Virginian.

1718
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:56,515
“Well, it wasn’t worth
such wide repawtin’.”

1719
01:31:56,515 --> 01:32:00,831
And he gave the simple facts to Taylor,
while I sat wondering at the

1720
01:32:00,831 --> 01:32:02,761
contagious powers of Rumor.

1721
01:32:02,761 --> 01:32:07,446
Here, through this voiceless land,
this desert, this vacuum,

1722
01:32:07,446 --> 01:32:10,210
it had spread like a change of weather.

1723
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:11,714
“Any news up your way?”

1724
01:32:11,714 --> 01:32:13,147
the Virginian concluded.

1725
01:32:13,147 --> 01:32:19,866
Importance came into Mr.
Taylor’s countenance.

1726
01:32:20,349 --> 01:32:24,638
“Bear Creek is going to build
a schoolhouse,” said he.

1727
01:32:24,638 --> 01:32:26,500
“Goodness gracious!”

1728
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,892
drawled the Virginian.

1729
01:32:27,892 --> 01:32:28,900
“What’s that for?”

1730
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:33,112
Now Mr. Taylor had been
married for some years.

1731
01:32:33,112 --> 01:32:37,647
“To educate the offspring of Bear Creek,”
he answered with pride.

1732
01:32:37,647 --> 01:32:42,081
“Offspring of Bear Creek,”
the Virginian meditatively repeated.

1733
01:32:42,081 --> 01:32:46,614
“I don’t remember noticin’ much offspring.

1734
01:32:46,614 --> 01:32:51,667
There was some white tail deer,
and a right smart o’ jack rabbits.”

1735
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:56,630
“The Swintons have moved up from
Drybone,” said Mr. Taylor,

1736
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:57,969
always seriously.

1737
01:32:57,969 --> 01:33:00,407
“They found it no place
for young children.

1738
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:04,949
And there’s Uncle Carmody with
six, and Ben Dow.

1739
01:33:04,949 --> 01:33:08,134
And Westfall has become
a family man, and⁠—”

1740
01:33:08,134 --> 01:33:09,374
“Jim Westfall!”

1741
01:33:09,374 --> 01:33:10,742
exclaimed the Virginian.

1742
01:33:10,742 --> 01:33:12,274
“Him a fam’ly man!

1743
01:33:12,274 --> 01:33:16,374
Well, if this hyeh Territory is goin’ to
get full o’ fam’ly men and empty o’

1744
01:33:16,374 --> 01:33:18,297
game, I believe I’ll⁠—”

1745
01:33:18,297 --> 01:33:20,894
“Get married yourself,”
suggested Mr. Taylor.

1746
01:33:20,894 --> 01:33:21,910
“Me!

1747
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,742
I ain’t near reached the marriageable age.

1748
01:33:24,742 --> 01:33:26,930
No, seh!

1749
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:30,507
But Uncle Hughey has got there
at last, yu’ know.”

1750
01:33:30,507 --> 01:33:31,744
“Uncle Hughey!”

1751
01:33:31,744 --> 01:33:33,827
shouted Mr. Taylor.

1752
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:35,454
He had not heard this.

1753
01:33:35,454 --> 01:33:37,384
Rumor is very capricious.

1754
01:33:37,384 --> 01:33:42,465
Therefore the Virginian told him,
and the family man rocked in his saddle.

1755
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:45,440
“Build your schoolhouse,”
said the Virginian.

1756
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:52,587
“Uncle Hughey has qualified himself to
subscribe to all such propositions.

1757
01:33:52,587 --> 01:33:54,548
Got your eye on a schoolmarm?”

1758
01:33:54,548 --> 01:33:55,547
CHAPTER V

1759
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:56,812
Enter the Woman

1760
01:33:56,812 --> 01:33:59,678
“We are taking steps,” said Mr. Taylor.

1761
01:33:59,678 --> 01:34:02,919
“Bear Creek ain’t going to be
hasty about a schoolmarm.”

1762
01:34:02,919 --> 01:34:04,861
“Sure,” assented the Virginian.

1763
01:34:04,861 --> 01:34:07,555
“The children wouldn’t want yu’ to hurry.”

1764
01:34:07,555 --> 01:34:13,003
But Mr. Taylor was, as I have indicated,
a serious family man.

1765
01:34:13,003 --> 01:34:18,976
The problem of educating his children
could appear to him in no light

1766
01:34:18,976 --> 01:34:21,224
except a sober one.

1767
01:34:21,224 --> 01:34:24,740
“Bear Creek,” he said,
“don’t want the experience they

1768
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,260
had over at Calef.

1769
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,039
We must not hire an ignoramus.”

1770
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:29,852
“Sure!”

1771
01:34:29,852 --> 01:34:31,640
assented the Virginian again.

1772
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,978
“Nor we don’t want no gad-a-way
flirt,” said Mr. Taylor.

1773
01:34:34,978 --> 01:34:39,468
“She must keep her eyes on the
blackboa’d,” said the Virginian, gently.

1774
01:34:39,468 --> 01:34:44,084
“Well, we can wait till we get a
guaranteed article,” said Mr. Taylor.

1775
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:46,226
“And that’s what we’re going to do.

1776
01:34:46,226 --> 01:34:49,333
It can’t be this year,
and it needn’t to be.

1777
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:52,675
None of the kids is very old,
and the schoolhouse has got to be

1778
01:34:52,675 --> 01:34:53,279
built.”

1779
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,585
He now drew a letter from his pocket,
and looked at me.

1780
01:34:56,585 --> 01:35:00,384
“Are you acquainted with Miss Mary Stark
Wood of Bennington, Vermont?”

1781
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:01,247
he inquired.

1782
01:35:01,247 --> 01:35:04,006
I was not acquainted with
her at this time.

1783
01:35:04,006 --> 01:35:05,687
“She’s one we are thinking of.

1784
01:35:05,687 --> 01:35:08,419
She’s a correspondent with Mrs. Balaam.”

1785
01:35:08,419 --> 01:35:10,383
Taylor handed me the letter.

1786
01:35:10,383 --> 01:35:15,248
“She wrote that to Mrs. Balaam,
and Mrs. Balaam said the best thing was

1787
01:35:15,248 --> 01:35:19,209
for to let me see it
and judge for myself.

1788
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:25,099
I’m taking it back to Mrs. Balaam.

1789
01:35:25,099 --> 01:35:29,663
Maybe you can give me your opinion how it
sizes up with the letters

1790
01:35:29,663 --> -1:59:59,000
they write back East?

1791
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1792
01:35:30,944 --> 01:35:34,875
The communication was mainly of a
business kind, but also

1793
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:36,724
personal, and freely written.

1794
01:35:36,724 --> 01:35:42,153
I do not think that its writer expected
it to be exhibited as a document.

1795
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:45,545
The writer wished very much that she
could see the West.

1796
01:35:45,545 --> 01:35:48,578
But she could not gratify this desire
merely for pleasure,

1797
01:35:48,578 --> 01:35:52,707
or she would long ago have accepted the
kind invitation to visit

1798
01:35:52,707 --> 01:35:54,654
Mrs. Balaam’s ranch.

1799
01:35:54,654 --> 01:35:59,111
Teaching school was something she would
like to do, if she were fitted for it.

1800
01:35:59,111 --> 01:36:05,579
“Since the mills failed” (the writer
said) “we have all gone to work and done

1801
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:10,530
a lot of things so that mother might
keep on living in the old house.

1802
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:13,356
Yes, the salary would be a temptation.

1803
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:17,870
But, my dear, isn’t Wyoming
bad for the complexion?

1804
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:20,577
And could I sue them if mine got damaged?

1805
01:36:20,577 --> 01:36:22,647
It is still admired.

1806
01:36:22,647 --> 01:36:26,630
I could bring one male witness at
least to prove that!”

1807
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:28,948
Then the writer became businesslike again.

1808
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:33,387
Even if she came to feel that she could
leave home, she did not at all know that

1809
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:35,126
she could teach school.

1810
01:36:35,126 --> 01:36:38,308
Nor did she think it right to accept a
position in which one

1811
01:36:38,308 --> 01:36:40,303
had had no experience.

1812
01:36:40,303 --> 01:36:44,509
“I do love children, boys
especially,” she went on.

1813
01:36:44,509 --> 01:36:48,145
“My small nephew and I get on famously.

1814
01:36:48,145 --> 01:36:53,073
But imagine if a whole benchful of boys
began asking me questions

1815
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:54,433
that I couldn’t answer!

1816
01:36:54,433 --> 01:36:55,485
What should I do?

1817
01:36:55,485 --> 01:36:57,717
For one could not spank
them all, you know!

1818
01:36:57,717 --> 01:37:01,762
And mother says that I ought not to teach
anybody spelling, because I leave the

1819
01:37:01,762 --> -1:59:59,000
u out of ‘honor.’

1820
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1821
01:37:03,315 --> 01:37:07,922
Altogether it was a letter which I could
assure Mr. Taylor “sized up” very well

1822
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:10,455
with the letters written in my part
of the United States.

1823
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:20,128
And it was signed, “Your very sincere
spinster, Molly Stark Wood.”

1824
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:27,215
“I never seen ‘honor’ spelled with a u,”
said Mr. Taylor, over whose not highly

1825
01:37:27,215 --> 01:37:32,821
civilized head certain portions of the
letter had lightly passed.

1826
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:37,414
I told him that some old-fashioned people
still wrote the word so.

1827
01:37:37,414 --> 01:37:42,178
“Either way would satisfy Bear Creek,”
said Mr. Taylor, “if she’s

1828
01:37:42,178 --> 01:37:44,245
otherwise up to requirements.”

1829
01:37:44,245 --> 01:37:48,011
The Virginian was now looking over the
letter musingly, and

1830
01:37:48,011 --> 01:37:49,411
with awakened attention.

1831
01:37:49,411 --> 01:37:53,535
“ ‘Your very sincere spinster,’
” he read aloud slowly.

1832
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:56,291
“I guess that means she’s
forty,” said Taylor.

1833
01:37:56,291 --> 01:37:59,574
“I reckon she is about
twenty,” said the Virginian.

1834
01:37:59,574 --> 01:38:03,530
And again he fell to musing over the
paper that he held.

1835
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:07,559
“Her handwriting ain’t like any I’ve
saw,” pursued Mr. Taylor.

1836
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:16,835
“But Bear Creek would not object to that,
provided she knows ’rithmetic and George

1837
01:38:16,835 --> 01:38:19,478
Washington, and them kind of things.”

1838
01:38:19,478 --> 01:38:24,825
“I expect she is not an awful sincere
spinster,” surmised the Virginian,

1839
01:38:24,825 --> 01:38:26,906
still looking at the letter,
still holding it as if

1840
01:38:26,906 --> 01:38:28,298
it were some token.

1841
01:38:28,298 --> 01:38:32,569
Has any botanist set down what the
seed of love is?

1842
01:38:32,569 --> 01:38:36,502
Has it anywhere been set down in how many
ways this seed may be sown?

1843
01:38:36,502 --> 01:38:43,088
In what various vessels of gossamer it
can float across wide spaces?

1844
01:38:43,088 --> 01:38:48,669
Or upon what different soils it can fall,
and live unknown, and bide

1845
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:50,416
its time for blooming?

1846
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:55,845
The Virginian handed back to Taylor the
sheet of note paper where a girl had

1847
01:38:55,845 --> 01:38:59,182
talked as the women he had
known did not talk.

1848
01:38:59,182 --> 01:39:04,026
If his eyes had ever seen such maidens,
there had been no meeting of eyes;

1849
01:39:04,026 --> 01:39:07,892
and if such maidens had ever spoken to
him, the speech was from

1850
01:39:07,892 --> 01:39:09,285
an established distance.

1851
01:39:09,285 --> 01:39:13,235
But here was a free language,
altogether new to him.

1852
01:39:13,235 --> 01:39:17,788
It proved, however, not alien to his
understanding, as it was

1853
01:39:17,788 --> 01:39:20,287
alien to Mr. Taylor’s.

1854
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:24,800
We drove onward, a mile
perhaps, and then two.

1855
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,515
He had lately been full of words,
but now he barely answered me,

1856
01:39:29,515 --> 01:39:32,626
so that a silence fell upon both of us.

1857
01:39:32,626 --> 01:39:35,997
It must have been all of ten miles that
we had driven when he spoke

1858
01:39:35,997 --> 01:39:37,205
of his own accord.

1859
01:39:37,205 --> 01:39:42,026
“Your real spinster don’t speak of her
lot that easy,” he remarked.

1860
01:39:42,026 --> 01:39:45,949
And presently he quoted a phrase about
the complexion, “ ‘Could I sue them

1861
01:39:45,949 --> 01:39:47,281
if mine got damaged?’

1862
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,444
” and he smiled over this to
himself, shaking his head.

1863
01:39:50,444 --> 01:39:52,664
“What would she be doing on Bear Creek?”

1864
01:39:52,664 --> 01:39:53,840
he next said.

1865
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,600
And finally: “I reckon that witness will
detain her in Vermont.

1866
01:39:58,600 --> -1:59:59,000
And her mother’ll keep livin’
at the old house

1867
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

1868
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

1869
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:06,750
Thus did the cowpuncher deliver himself,
not knowing at all that the seed had

1870
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:12,501
floated across wide spaces,
and was biding its time in his heart.

1871
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:15,507
On the morrow we reached Sunk Creek.

1872
01:40:15,507 --> 01:40:19,627
Judge Henry’s welcome and his wife’s
would have obliterated any hardships

1873
01:40:19,627 --> 01:40:23,507
that I had endured, and I had
endured none at all.

1874
01:40:23,507 --> 01:40:26,295
For a while I saw little of the Virginian.

1875
01:40:26,295 --> 01:40:29,998
He lapsed into his native way of
addressing me occasionally as “seh”⁠—a

1876
01:40:29,998 --> 01:40:33,579
habit entirely repudiated by
this land of equality.

1877
01:40:33,579 --> 01:40:34,678
I was sorry.

1878
01:40:34,678 --> 01:40:39,519
Our common peril during the runaway of
Buck and Muggins had brought us to a

1879
01:40:39,519 --> 01:40:42,985
familiarity that I hoped
was destined to last.

1880
01:40:42,985 --> 01:40:47,361
But I think that it would not have gone
farther, save for a certain personage⁠—I

1881
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:49,083
must call her a personage.

1882
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:55,713
And as I am indebted to her for gaining
me a friend whose prejudice against me

1883
01:40:55,713 --> 01:41:00,352
might never have been otherwise
overcome, I shall tell you her little

1884
01:41:00,352 --> 01:41:06,950
story, and how her misadventures and her
fate came to bring the Virginian and me

1885
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:09,853
to an appreciation of one another.

1886
01:41:09,853 --> 01:41:14,737
Without her, it is likely I should also
not have heard so much of the story of

1887
01:41:14,737 --> 01:41:20,172
the schoolmarm, and how that lady at
last came to Bear Creek.

1888
01:41:20,172 --> 01:41:21,293
CHAPTER VI

1889
01:41:21,293 --> 01:41:21,698
Em’ly

1890
01:41:21,698 --> 01:41:25,610
My personage was a hen,
and she lived at the Sunk Creek Ranch.

1891
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:30,288
Judge Henry’s ranch was
notable for several luxuries.

1892
01:41:30,288 --> 01:41:32,609
He had milk, for example.

1893
01:41:32,609 --> 01:41:37,234
In those days his brother ranchmen had
thousands of cattle very often,

1894
01:41:37,234 --> 01:41:41,242
but not a drop of milk,
save the condensed variety.

1895
01:41:41,242 --> 01:41:43,020
Therefore they had no butter.

1896
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,596
The Judge had plenty.

1897
01:41:44,596 --> 01:41:48,596
Next rarest to butter and milk in the
cattle country were eggs.

1898
01:41:48,596 --> 01:41:50,983
But my host had chickens.

1899
01:41:50,983 --> 01:41:54,262
Whether this was because he had followed
cockfighting in his early days,

1900
01:41:54,262 --> 01:41:57,540
or whether it was due to Mrs.
Henry, I cannot say.

1901
01:41:57,540 --> 01:42:02,456
I only know that when I took a meal
elsewhere, I was likely to find nothing

1902
01:42:02,456 --> 01:42:06,922
but the eternal “sowbelly,”
beans, and coffee; while at Sunk Creek

1903
01:42:06,922 --> 01:42:08,793
the omelet and the custard were
frequent.

1904
01:42:08,793 --> 01:42:12,736
The passing traveller was glad to tie his
horse to the fence here,

1905
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,421
and sit down to the Judge’s table.

1906
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:18,588
For its fame was as wide as Wyoming.

1907
01:42:18,588 --> 01:42:23,081
It was an oasis in the Territory’s
desolate bill-of-fare.

1908
01:42:23,081 --> 01:42:28,312
The long fences of Judge Henry’s home
ranch began upon Sunk Creek soon after

1909
01:42:28,312 --> 01:42:31,695
that stream emerged from its canyon
through the Bow Leg.

1910
01:42:31,695 --> 01:42:35,654
It was a place always well cared for by
the owner, even in the

1911
01:42:35,654 --> 01:42:37,388
days of his bachelorhood.

1912
01:42:37,388 --> 01:42:42,867
The placid regiments of cattle lay in the
cool of the cottonwoods by the water,

1913
01:42:42,867 --> 01:42:48,282
or slowly moved among the sagebrush,
feeding upon the grass that in those

1914
01:42:48,282 --> 01:42:53,327
forever departed years
was plentiful and tall.

1915
01:42:53,327 --> 01:42:58,249
The steers came fat off his unenclosed
range and fattened still more in his

1916
01:42:58,249 --> 01:43:03,121
large pasture; while his small pasture,
a field some eight miles square,

1917
01:43:03,121 --> 01:43:07,601
was for several seasons given to the
Judge’s horses, and over this ample

1918
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:15,435
space there played and prospered the
good colts which he raised from

1919
01:43:15,435 --> 01:43:17,795
Paladin, his imported stallion.

1920
01:43:17,795 --> 01:43:23,268
After he married, I have been assured
that his wife’s influence became visible

1921
01:43:23,268 --> 01:43:25,732
in and about the house at once.

1922
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:30,152
Shade trees were planted,
flowers attempted, and to the chickens

1923
01:43:30,152 --> 01:43:32,561
was added the much more
troublesome turkey.

1924
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:39,496
I, the visitor, was pressed into service
when I arrived, green from the East.

1925
01:43:39,496 --> 01:43:43,606
I took hold of the farmyard and began
building a better chicken house,

1926
01:43:43,606 --> 01:43:48,793
while the Judge was off creating meadow
land in his gray and yellow wilderness.

1927
01:43:48,793 --> 01:43:54,224
When any cowboy was unoccupied,
he would lounge over to my neighborhood,

1928
01:43:54,224 --> 01:43:56,268
and silently regard my carpentering.

1929
01:43:56,268 --> 01:44:00,632
Those cowpunchers bore
names of various denominations.

1930
01:44:00,632 --> 01:44:03,788
There was Honey Wiggin;
there was Nebrasky, and

1931
01:44:03,788 --> 01:44:05,571
Dollar Bill, and Chalkeye.

1932
01:44:05,571 --> 01:44:10,872
And they came from farms and cities,
from Maine and from California.

1933
01:44:10,872 --> 01:44:15,750
But the romance of American adventure had
drawn them all alike to this great

1934
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,584
playground of young men,
and in their courage,

1935
01:44:18,584 --> 01:44:22,044
their generosity, and their amusement at
me they bore a close

1936
01:44:22,044 --> 01:44:24,455
resemblance to each other.

1937
01:44:24,455 --> 01:44:28,425
Each one would silently observe my
achievements with the

1938
01:44:28,425 --> 01:44:30,226
hammer and the chisel.

1939
01:44:30,226 --> 01:44:37,054
Then he would retire to the bunk-house,
and presently I would overhear laughter.

1940
01:44:37,054 --> 01:44:42,534
But this was only in the morning.

1941
01:44:42,534 --> 01:44:46,193
In the afternoon on many days of the
summer which I spent at the Sunk Creek

1942
01:44:46,193 --> 01:44:50,406
Ranch I would go shooting,
or ride up toward the entrance of the

1943
01:44:50,406 --> 01:44:54,408
canyon and watch the men working
on the irrigation ditches.

1944
01:44:54,408 --> 01:44:58,048
Pleasant systems of water running in
channels were being led through the

1945
01:44:58,048 --> 01:45:02,731
soil, and there was a sound of rippling
here and there among the yellow grain;

1946
01:45:02,731 --> 01:45:08,150
the green thick alfalfa grass waved
almost, it seemed, of its own accord,

1947
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:11,830
for the wind never blew;
and when at evening the sun lay against

1948
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:15,848
the plain, the rift of the canyon was
filled with a violet light,

1949
01:45:15,848 --> 01:45:19,230
and the Bow Leg Mountains became
transfigured with hues of

1950
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:22,285
floating and unimaginable color.

1951
01:45:22,285 --> 01:45:28,677
The sun shone in a sky where never a
cloud came, and noon was not too warm

1952
01:45:28,677 --> 01:45:30,397
nor the dark too cool.

1953
01:45:30,397 --> 01:45:34,482
And so for two months I went through
these pleasant uneventful days,

1954
01:45:34,482 --> 01:45:38,682
improving the chickens,
an object of mirth, living in the open

1955
01:45:38,682 --> 01:45:43,270
air, and basking in the
perfection of content.

1956
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:47,021
I was justly styled a tenderfoot.

1957
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:47,631
Mrs.

1958
01:45:47,631 --> 01:45:52,204
Henry had in the beginning endeavored to
shield me from this humiliation;

1959
01:45:52,204 --> 01:45:57,127
but when she found that I was inveterate
in laying my inexperience of Western

1960
01:45:57,127 --> 01:46:01,178
matters bare to all the world,
begging to be enlightened upon

1961
01:46:01,178 --> 01:46:06,595
rattlesnakes, prairie-dogs,
owls, blue and willow grouse,

1962
01:46:06,595 --> 01:46:11,919
sage-hens, how to rope a horse or
tighten the front cinch of my saddle,

1963
01:46:11,919 --> 01:46:17,558
and that my spirit soared into
enthusiasm at the mere sight of so

1964
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:22,481
ordinary an animal as a white-tailed
deer, she let me rush about with my

1965
01:46:22,481 --> 01:46:28,464
firearms and made no further effort to
stave off the ridicule that my blunders

1966
01:46:28,464 --> 01:46:32,492
perpetually earned from the ranch hands,
her own humorous husband,

1967
01:46:32,492 --> 01:46:36,455
and any chance visitor who stopped for a
meal or stayed the night.

1968
01:46:36,455 --> 01:46:41,294
I was not called by my name after the
first feeble etiquette due to a stranger

1969
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:44,704
in his first few hours had died away.

1970
01:46:44,704 --> 01:46:47,389
I was known simply as “the tenderfoot.”

1971
01:46:47,389 --> 01:46:52,182
I was introduced to the neighborhood (a
circle of eighty miles)

1972
01:46:52,182 --> 01:46:54,691
as “the tenderfoot.”

1973
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:59,088
It was thus that Balaam,
the maltreater of horses,

1974
01:46:59,088 --> 01:47:02,777
learned to address me when he came a two
days’ journey to pay a visit.

1975
01:47:02,777 --> 01:47:08,533
And it was this name and my notorious
helplessness that bid fair to end what

1976
01:47:08,533 --> 01:47:10,670
relations I had with the Virginian.

1977
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:14,253
For when Judge Henry ascertained that
nothing could prevent me from losing

1978
01:47:14,253 --> 01:47:18,133
myself, that it was not uncommon for me
to saunter out after breakfast with a

1979
01:47:18,133 --> 01:47:22,586
gun and in thirty minutes cease to know
north from south, he

1980
01:47:22,586 --> 01:47:24,288
arranged for my protection.

1981
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,386
He detailed an escort for me;
and the escort was once

1982
01:47:27,386 --> 01:47:29,071
more the trustworthy man!

1983
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:33,688
The poor Virginian was taken from his
work and his comrades and set to

1984
01:47:33,688 --> 01:47:35,115
playing nurse for me.

1985
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:40,322
And for a while this humiliation ate
into his untamed soul.

1986
01:47:40,322 --> 01:47:45,565
It was his lugubrious lot to accompany me
in my rambles, preside over my blunders,

1987
01:47:45,565 --> 01:47:53,587
and save me from calamitously passing
into the next world.

1988
01:47:53,587 --> 01:47:59,708
He bore it in courteous silence,
except when speaking was necessary.

1989
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:03,848
He would show me the lower ford,
which I could never find for myself,

1990
01:48:03,848 --> 01:48:06,370
generally mistaking a quicksand for it.

1991
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:08,623
He would tie my horse properly.

1992
01:48:08,623 --> 01:48:13,290
He would recommend me not to shoot my
rifle at a white-tailed deer in the

1993
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:18,132
particular moment that the outfit wagon
was passing behind the animal on the

1994
01:48:18,132 --> 01:48:19,751
further side of the brush.

1995
01:48:19,751 --> 01:48:23,703
There was seldom a day that he was not
obliged to hasten and save me from

1996
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:27,406
sudden death or from
ridicule, which is worse.

1997
01:48:27,406 --> 01:48:31,797
Yet never once did he lose his patience
and his gentle, slow voice,

1998
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:35,866
and apparently lazy manner remained the
same, whether we were sitting at lunch

1999
01:48:35,866 --> 01:48:40,504
together, or up in the mountain during a
hunt, or whether he was bringing me back

2000
01:48:40,504 --> 01:48:46,024
my horse, which had run away because I
had again forgotten to throw the reins

2001
01:48:46,024 --> 01:48:48,029
over his head and let them trail.

2002
01:48:48,029 --> 01:48:51,328
“He’ll always stand if yu’ do that,”
the Virginian would say.

2003
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,224
“See how my hawss stays
right quiet yondeh.”

2004
01:48:54,224 --> 01:48:57,007
After such admonition he would say
no more to me.

2005
01:48:57,007 --> 01:49:02,339
But this tame nursery business was
assuredly gall to him.

2006
01:49:02,339 --> 01:49:06,559
For though utterly a man in countenance
and in his self-possession and

2007
01:49:06,559 --> 01:49:11,939
incapacity to be put at a loss,
he was still boyishly proud of his wild

2008
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:18,668
calling, and wore his leather straps and
jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure.

2009
01:49:18,668 --> 01:49:23,768
His tiger limberness and his beauty were
rich with unabated youth;

2010
01:49:23,768 --> 01:49:28,488
and that force which lurked beneath his
surface must often have curbed

2011
01:49:28,488 --> 01:49:30,076
his intolerance of me.

2012
01:49:30,076 --> 01:49:33,830
In spite of what I knew must be his
opinion of me, the tenderfoot,

2013
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:37,377
my liking for him grew,
and I found his silent company

2014
01:49:37,377 --> 01:49:38,760
more and more agreeable.

2015
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,524
That he had spells of talking,
I had already learned at Medicine Bow.

2016
01:49:42,524 --> 01:49:47,074
But his present taciturnity might almost
have effaced this impression,

2017
01:49:47,074 --> 01:49:50,979
had I not happened to pass by the bunk-
house one evening after dark,

2018
01:49:50,979 --> 01:49:54,569
when Honey Wiggin and the rest of the
cowboys were gathered inside it.

2019
01:49:54,569 --> 01:49:58,657
That afternoon the Virginian and I
had gone duck shooting.

2020
01:49:58,657 --> 01:50:04,622
We had found several in a beaver dam,
and I had killed two as they sat close

2021
01:50:04,622 --> 01:50:09,161
together; but they floated against the
breastwork of sticks out in the water

2022
01:50:09,161 --> 01:50:12,992
some four feet deep,
where the escaping current might carry

2023
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,396
them down the stream.

2024
01:50:14,396 --> 01:50:17,783
The Judge’s red setter had not
accompanied us, because she

2025
01:50:17,783 --> 01:50:19,383
was expecting a family.

2026
01:50:19,383 --> 01:50:23,927
“We don’t want her along anyways,”
the cowpuncher had explained to me.

2027
01:50:23,927 --> 01:50:28,513
“She runs around mighty irresponsible,
and she’ll stand a prairie-dog ’bout as

2028
01:50:28,513 --> 01:50:30,504
often as she’ll stand a bird.

2029
01:50:30,504 --> -1:59:59,000
She’s a triflin’ animal.

2030
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2031
01:50:32,035 --> 01:50:37,073
My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to
pitch into the water with all my clothes

2032
01:50:37,073 --> 01:50:43,410
on, and subsequently crawl out a
slippery, triumphant, weltering heap.

2033
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:48,006
The Virginian’s serious eyes had rested
upon this spectacle of mud;

2034
01:50:48,006 --> 01:50:50,135
but he expressed nothing, as usual.

2035
01:50:50,135 --> 01:50:56,291
“They ain’t overly good eatin’,” he
observed, tying the birds to his saddle.

2036
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:57,882
“They’re divers.”

2037
01:50:57,882 --> 01:50:59,214
“Divers!”

2038
01:50:59,214 --> 01:51:00,339
I exclaimed.

2039
01:51:00,339 --> 01:51:01,786
“Why didn’t they dive?”

2040
01:51:01,786 --> 01:51:04,585
“I reckon they was young
ones and hadn’t experience.”

2041
01:51:04,585 --> 01:51:08,558
“Well,” I said, crestfallen,
but attempting to be humorous,

2042
01:51:08,558 --> 01:51:09,870
“I did the diving myself.”

2043
01:51:09,870 --> 01:51:11,478
But the Virginian made no comment.

2044
01:51:11,478 --> 01:51:15,309
He handed me my double-barrelled English
gun, which I was about to leave deserted

2045
01:51:15,309 --> 01:51:19,544
on the ground behind me,
and we rode home in our usual silence,

2046
01:51:19,544 --> 01:51:24,024
the mean little white-breasted,
sharp-billed divers dangling

2047
01:51:24,024 --> 01:51:24,816
from his saddle.

2048
01:51:24,816 --> 01:51:28,800
It was in the bunk-house that
he took his revenge.

2049
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,710
As I passed I heard his gentle voice
silently achieving some narrative to an

2050
01:51:33,710 --> 01:51:38,934
attentive audience, and just as I came
by the open window where he sat on his

2051
01:51:38,934 --> 01:51:44,728
bed in shirt and drawers,
his back to me, I heard his concluding

2052
01:51:44,728 --> 01:51:49,328
words, “And the hat on his haid was the
one mark showed yu’ he

2053
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:50,930
weren’t a snappin’-turtle.”

2054
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:54,568
The anecdote met with instantaneous
success, and I hurried

2055
01:51:54,568 --> 01:51:55,767
away into the dark.

2056
01:51:55,767 --> 01:51:59,249
The next morning I was
occupied with the chickens.

2057
01:51:59,249 --> 01:52:03,969
Two hens were fighting to sit on some
eggs that a third was daily laying,

2058
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:07,710
and which I did not want hatched,
and for the third time I had kicked

2059
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:14,257
Em’ly off seven potatoes she had rolled
together and was determined to raise I

2060
01:52:14,257 --> 01:52:18,052
know not what sort of family from.

2061
01:52:18,052 --> 01:52:22,592
She was shrieking about the henhouse as
the Virginian came in to observe (I

2062
01:52:22,592 --> 01:52:26,592
suspect) what I might be doing now that
could be useful for him to mention

2063
01:52:26,592 --> 01:52:27,753
in the bunk-house.

2064
01:52:27,753 --> 01:52:32,003
He stood awhile, and at length said,
“We lost our best rooster when Mrs.

2065
01:52:32,003 --> 01:52:33,363
Henry came to live hyeh.”

2066
01:52:33,363 --> 01:52:34,650
I paid no attention.

2067
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:38,115
“He was a right elegant
Dominicker,” he continued.

2068
01:52:38,115 --> 01:52:41,923
I felt a little riled about the snapping-
turtle, and showed no interest in what he

2069
01:52:41,923 --> 01:52:45,065
was saying, but continued my
functions among the hens.

2070
01:52:45,065 --> 01:52:49,481
This unusual silence of mine seemed to
elicit unusual speech from him.

2071
01:52:49,481 --> 01:52:53,201
“Yu’ see, that rooster he’d always lived
round hyeh when the Judge was a

2072
01:52:53,201 --> 01:52:57,406
bachelor, and he never seen no ladies or
any persons wearing female gyarments.

2073
01:52:57,406 --> -1:59:59,000
You ain’t got rheumatism, seh?

2074
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2075
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:00,624
“Me?

2076
01:53:00,624 --> 01:53:01,335
No.”

2077
01:53:01,335 --> 01:53:05,125
“I reckoned maybe them little odd divers
yu’ got damp goin’ afteh⁠—”

2078
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:06,486
He paused.

2079
01:53:06,486 --> 01:53:09,009
“Oh, no, not in the least, thank you.”

2080
01:53:09,009 --> 01:53:12,526
“Yu’ seemed sort o’ grave this mawnin’,
and I’m cert’nly glad

2081
01:53:12,526 --> 01:53:14,108
it ain’t them divers.”

2082
01:53:14,108 --> 01:53:16,146
“Well, the rooster?”

2083
01:53:16,146 --> 01:53:17,817
I inquired finally.

2084
01:53:17,817 --> 01:53:19,142
“Oh, him!

2085
01:53:19,142 --> 01:53:23,472
He weren’t raised where
he could see petticoats.

2086
01:53:23,472 --> 01:53:23,872
Mrs.

2087
01:53:23,872 --> 01:53:28,845
Henry she come hyeh from the railroad
with the Judge afteh dark.

2088
01:53:28,845 --> 01:53:32,802
Next mawnin’ early she walked out to view
her new home, and the rooster was a-

2089
01:53:32,802 --> 01:53:35,098
feedin’ by the door, and he seen her.

2090
01:53:35,098 --> 01:53:38,953
Well, seh, he screeched that awful I run
out of the bunk-house;

2091
01:53:38,953 --> 01:53:42,554
and he jus’ went over the fence and took
down Sunk Creek shoutin’

2092
01:53:42,554 --> 01:53:44,003
fire, right along.

2093
01:53:44,003 --> -1:59:59,000
He has never come back.

2094
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2095
01:53:48,748 --> 01:53:55,010
“There’s a hen over there now that has no
judgment,” I said, indicating Em’ly.

2096
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:58,954
She had got herself outside the house,
and was on the bars of a corral,

2097
01:53:58,954 --> 01:54:02,580
her vociferations reduced
to an occasional squawk.

2098
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,756
I told him about the potatoes.

2099
01:54:04,756 --> 01:54:08,193
“I never knowed her name before,” said he.

2100
01:54:08,193 --> 01:54:11,641
“That runaway rooster, he hated her.

2101
01:54:11,641 --> 01:54:13,895
And she hated him same as
she hates ’em all.”

2102
01:54:13,895 --> 01:54:16,490
“I named her myself,”
said I, “after I came

2103
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:18,787
to notice her particularly.

2104
01:54:18,787 --> 01:54:22,392
There’s an old maid at home who’s
charitable, and belongs to the Cruelty

2105
01:54:22,392 --> 01:54:26,765
to Animals, and she never knows whether
she had better cross in front of a

2106
01:54:26,765 --> 01:54:28,646
street car or wait.

2107
01:54:28,646 --> 01:54:31,166
I named the hen after her.

2108
01:54:31,166 --> 01:54:32,802
Does she ever lay eggs?”

2109
01:54:32,802 --> 01:54:37,571
The Virginian had not “troubled his
haid” over the poultry.

2110
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:39,905
“Well, I don’t believe she knows how.

2111
01:54:39,905 --> 01:54:41,911
I think she came near being a rooster.”

2112
01:54:41,911 --> 01:54:45,143
“She’s sure manly-lookin’,”
said the Virginian.

2113
01:54:45,143 --> 01:54:48,116
We had walked toward the corral,
and he was now scrutinizing

2114
01:54:48,116 --> 01:54:49,097
Em’ly with interest.

2115
01:54:49,097 --> 01:54:51,050
She was an egregious fowl.

2116
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:54,733
She was huge and gaunt,
with great yellow beak,

2117
01:54:54,733 --> 01:54:58,268
and she stood straight and alert in the
manner of responsible people.

2118
01:54:58,268 --> 01:55:00,450
There was something wrong with her tail.

2119
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:04,082
It slanted far to one side,
one feather in it twice as

2120
01:55:04,082 --> 01:55:05,263
long as the rest.

2121
01:55:05,263 --> 01:55:07,577
Feathers on her breast there were none.

2122
01:55:07,577 --> 01:55:12,918
These had been worn entirely off by her
habit of sitting upon potatoes and

2123
01:55:12,918 --> 01:55:15,460
other rough abnormal objects.

2124
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:22,887
And this lent to her appearance an air of
being décollete, singularly at variance

2125
01:55:22,887 --> 01:55:26,516
with her otherwise prudish ensemble.

2126
01:55:26,516 --> 01:55:31,442
Her eye was remarkably bright,
but somehow it had an

2127
01:55:31,442 --> 01:55:32,925
outraged expression.

2128
01:55:32,925 --> 01:55:39,135
It was as if she went about the world
perpetually scandalized over the doings

2129
01:55:39,135 --> 01:55:41,266
that fell beneath her notice.

2130
01:55:41,266 --> 01:55:45,595
Her legs were blue, long,
and remarkably stout.

2131
01:55:45,595 --> 01:55:49,672
“She’d ought to wear knickerbockers,”
murmured the Virginian.

2132
01:55:49,672 --> 01:55:53,258
“She’d look a heap better ’n some
o’ them college students.

2133
01:55:53,258 --> -1:59:59,000
And she’ll set on potatoes, yu’ say?

2134
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2135
01:55:55,404 --> 01:55:59,049
“She thinks she can hatch out anything.

2136
01:55:59,049 --> 01:56:02,557
I’ve found her with onions,
and last Tuesday I caught her on

2137
01:56:02,557 --> -1:59:59,000
two balls of soap.

2138
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2139
01:56:03,997 --> 01:56:09,400
In the afternoon the tall cowpuncher and
I rode out to get an antelope.

2140
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,933
After an hour, during which he was
completely taciturn,

2141
01:56:12,933 --> 01:56:18,695
he said: “I reckon maybe this hyeh
lonesome country ain’t been healthy for

2142
01:56:18,695 --> 01:56:19,751
Em’ly to live in.

2143
01:56:19,751 --> 01:56:21,490
It ain’t for some humans.

2144
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:25,265
Them old trappers in the mountains gets
skewed in the haid mighty often,

2145
01:56:25,265 --> 01:56:28,787
an’ talks out loud when nobody’s nigher
’n a hundred miles.”

2146
01:56:28,787 --> 01:56:31,579
“Em’ly has not been solitary,” I replied.

2147
01:56:31,579 --> 01:56:33,078
“There are forty chickens here.”

2148
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:34,744
“That’s so,” said he.

2149
01:56:34,744 --> 01:56:36,047
“It don’t explain her.”

2150
01:56:36,047 --> 01:56:39,586
He fell silent again,
riding beside me, easy and

2151
01:56:39,586 --> 01:56:42,159
indolent in the saddle.

2152
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:48,773
His long figure looked so loose and inert
that the swift, light spring he made to

2153
01:56:48,773 --> 01:56:51,146
the ground seemed an impossible feat.

2154
01:56:51,146 --> 01:56:54,111
He had seen an antelope where I saw none.

2155
01:56:54,111 --> 01:56:57,423
“Take a shot yourself,”
I urged him, as he motioned

2156
01:56:57,423 --> 01:56:58,423
me to be quick.

2157
01:56:58,423 --> 01:57:00,363
“You never shoot when I’m with you.”

2158
01:57:00,363 --> 01:57:03,355
“I ain’t hyeh for that,” he answered.

2159
01:57:03,355 --> 01:57:05,494
“Now you’ve let him get away on yu’!”

2160
01:57:05,494 --> 01:57:07,506
The antelope had in truth departed.

2161
01:57:07,506 --> 01:57:11,847
“Why,” he said to my protest,
“I can hit them things any day.

2162
01:57:11,847 --> 01:57:13,795
What’s your notion as to Em’ly?”

2163
01:57:13,795 --> 01:57:16,716
“I can’t account for her,” I replied.

2164
01:57:16,716 --> 01:57:19,868
“Well,” he said musingly,
and then his mind took one of those

2165
01:57:19,868 --> 01:57:23,867
particular turns that made me love him,
“Taylor ought to see her.

2166
01:57:23,867 --> 01:57:26,320
She’d be just the schoolmarm
for Bear Creek!”

2167
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:30,191
“She’s not much like the eating-house
lady at Medicine Bow,” I said.

2168
01:57:30,191 --> 01:57:31,858
He gave a hilarious chuckle.

2169
01:57:31,858 --> 01:57:34,720
“No, Em’ly knows nothing o’ them joys.

2170
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,560
So yu’ have no notion about her?

2171
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,375
Well, I’ve got one.

2172
01:57:38,375 --> 01:57:41,773
I reckon maybe she was hatched
after a big thunderstorm.”

2173
01:57:41,773 --> 01:57:43,681
“In a big thunderstorm!”

2174
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:44,966
I exclaimed.

2175
01:57:44,966 --> 01:57:45,842
“Yes.

2176
01:57:45,842 --> 01:57:49,163
Don’t yu’ know about them,
and what they’ll do to aiggs?

2177
01:57:49,163 --> 01:57:53,704
A big case o’ lightnin’ and thunder will
addle aiggs and keep ’em from hatchin’.

2178
01:57:53,704 --> 01:57:56,864
And I expect one came along,
and all the other aiggs of Em’ly’s set

2179
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:00,647
didn’t hatch out, but got plumb addled,
and she happened not to get addled that

2180
01:58:00,647 --> 01:58:02,940
far, and so she just managed
to make it through.

2181
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,486
But she cert’nly ain’t got a strong haid.”

2182
01:58:05,486 --> 01:58:07,416
“I fear she has not,” said I.

2183
01:58:07,416 --> 01:58:10,633
“Mighty hon’ble intentions,” he observed.

2184
01:58:10,633 --> 01:58:14,969
“If she can’t make out to lay anything,
she wants to hatch somethin’, and

2185
01:58:14,969 --> 01:58:16,340
be a mother anyways.”

2186
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:22,871
“I wonder what relation the law considers
that a hen is to the chicken she hatched

2187
01:58:22,871 --> 01:58:24,199
but did not lay?”

2188
01:58:24,199 --> 01:58:24,977
I inquired.

2189
01:58:24,977 --> 01:58:29,179
The Virginian made no reply
to this frivolous suggestion.

2190
01:58:29,179 --> 01:58:33,899
He was gazing over the wide landscape
gravely and with apparent inattention.

2191
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:38,728
He invariably saw game before I did,
and was off his horse and crouched among

2192
01:58:38,728 --> 01:58:42,890
the sage while I was still getting my
left foot clear of the stirrup.

2193
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:46,091
I succeeded in killing an antelope,
and we rode home with the

2194
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:48,692
head and hind quarters.

2195
01:58:48,692 --> 01:58:50,733
“No,” said he.

2196
01:58:50,733 --> 01:58:54,943
“It’s sure the thunder,
and not the lonesomeness.

2197
01:58:54,943 --> 01:58:57,880
How do yu’ like the lonesomeness
yourself?”

2198
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,913
I told him that I liked it.

2199
01:58:59,913 --> 01:59:03,052
“I could not live without
it now,” he said.

2200
01:59:03,052 --> 01:59:04,759
“This has got into my system.”

2201
01:59:04,759 --> 01:59:07,534
He swept his hand out at the
vast space of world.

2202
01:59:07,534 --> 01:59:11,693
“I went back home to see my folks onced.

2203
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:14,722
Mother was dyin’ slow, and she wanted me.

2204
01:59:14,722 --> 01:59:16,037
I stayed a year.

2205
01:59:16,037 --> 01:59:19,356
But them Virginia mountains could
please me no more.

2206
01:59:19,356 --> 01:59:24,100
Afteh she was gone, I told my
brothers and sisters goodbye.

2207
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:27,106
We like each other well enough,
but I reckon I’ll not go back.”

2208
01:59:27,106 --> 01:59:31,153
We found Em’ly seated upon a collection
of green California peaches,

2209
01:59:31,153 --> 01:59:33,196
which the Judge had brought
from the railroad.

2210
01:59:33,196 --> 01:59:36,312
“I don’t mind her any more,”
I said; “I’m sorry for her.”

2211
01:59:36,312 --> 01:59:39,405
“I’ve been sorry for her right
along,” said the Virginian.

2212
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:42,453
“She does hate the roosters so.”

2213
01:59:42,453 --> 01:59:47,882
And he said that he was making a
collection of every class of object

2214
01:59:47,882 --> 01:59:50,864
which he found her treating as eggs.

2215
01:59:50,864 --> 01:59:55,747
But Em’ly’s egg-industry was terminated
abruptly one morning,

2216
01:59:55,747 --> 01:59:58,667
and her unquestioned energies diverted
to a new channel.

2217
01:59:58,667 --> 02:00:02,227
A turkey which had been sitting in the
root-house appeared with twelve

2218
02:00:02,227 --> 02:00:06,929
children, and a family of
bantams occurred almost simultaneously.

2219
02:00:06,929 --> 02:00:11,690
Em’ly was importantly scratching the soil
inside Paladin’s corral when the bantam

2220
02:00:11,690 --> 02:00:15,249
tribe of newly born came by down the
lane, and she caught sight of

2221
02:00:15,249 --> 02:00:16,740
them through the bars.

2222
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:20,951
She crossed the corral at a run,
and intercepted two of the chicks that

2223
02:00:20,951 --> 02:00:23,864
were trailing somewhat
behind their real mamma.

2224
02:00:23,864 --> 02:00:28,552
These she undertook to appropriate,
and assumed a high tone with the bantam,

2225
02:00:28,552 --> 02:00:31,358
who was the smaller,
and hence obliged to retreat with

2226
02:00:31,358 --> 02:00:33,977
her still numerous family.

2227
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:38,414
I interfered, and put matters straight;
but the adjustment was only temporary.

2228
02:00:38,414 --> 02:00:43,776
In an hour I saw Em’ly immensely busy
with two more bantams,

2229
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:48,431
leading them about and taking a care of
them which I must admit

2230
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:50,812
seemed perfectly efficient.

2231
02:00:50,812 --> 02:00:56,774
And now came the first incident that made
me suspect her to be demented.

2232
02:00:56,774 --> 02:01:00,433
She had proceeded with her changelings
behind the kitchen, where one of the

2233
02:01:00,433 --> 02:01:05,034
irrigation ditches ran under the fence
from the hayfield to supply

2234
02:01:05,034 --> 02:01:06,785
the house with water.

2235
02:01:06,785 --> 02:01:13,367
Some distance along this ditch inside the
field were the twelve turkeys in the

2236
02:01:13,367 --> 02:01:16,908
short, recently cut stubble.

2237
02:01:16,908 --> 02:01:20,414
Again Em’ly set off instantly like a deer.

2238
02:01:20,414 --> 02:01:23,938
She left the dismayed bantams behind her.

2239
02:01:23,938 --> 02:01:28,205
She crossed the ditch with one jump of
her stout blue legs,

2240
02:01:28,205 --> 02:01:31,831
flew over the grass,
and was at once among the turkeys,

2241
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:37,423
where, with an instinct of maternity as
undiscriminating as it was reckless,

2242
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:40,837
she attempted to huddle
some of them away.

2243
02:01:40,837 --> 02:01:45,314
But this other mamma was not a bantam,
and in a few moments Em’ly was entirely

2244
02:01:45,314 --> 02:01:49,240
routed in her attempt to acquire a
new variety of family.

2245
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:54,137
This spectacle was witnessed by the
Virginian and myself,

2246
02:01:54,137 --> 02:01:55,354
and it overcame him.

2247
02:01:55,354 --> 02:02:00,038
He went speechless across to the bunk-
house, by himself, and sat on his bed,

2248
02:02:00,038 --> 02:02:04,108
while I took the abandoned bantams back
to their own circle.

2249
02:02:04,108 --> 02:02:10,207
I have often wondered what the other
fowls thought of all this.

2250
02:02:10,207 --> 02:02:13,585
Some impression it certainly
did make upon them.

2251
02:02:13,585 --> 02:02:19,485
The notion may seem out of reason to
those who have never closely attended to

2252
02:02:19,485 --> 02:02:24,047
other animals than man;
but I am convinced that any community

2253
02:02:24,047 --> 02:02:28,434
which shares some of our instincts will
share some of the resulting feelings,

2254
02:02:28,434 --> 02:02:32,190
and that birds and beasts have
conventions, the breach

2255
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,630
of which startles them.

2256
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:36,987
If there be anything in evolution,
this would seem inevitable.

2257
02:02:36,987 --> 02:02:42,776
At all events, the chicken-house was
upset during the following several days.

2258
02:02:42,776 --> 02:02:47,325
Em’ly disturbed now the bantams and now
the turkeys, and several of these latter

2259
02:02:47,325 --> 02:02:51,047
had died, though I will not go so far as
to say that this was the result

2260
02:02:51,047 --> 02:02:53,067
of her misplaced attentions.

2261
02:02:53,067 --> 02:02:57,697
Nevertheless, I was seriously thinking of
locking her up till the broods should be

2262
02:02:57,697 --> 02:03:02,489
a little older, when another event
happened, and all was suddenly at peace.

2263
02:03:02,489 --> 02:03:06,574
The Judge’s setter came in one
morning, wagging her tail.

2264
02:03:06,574 --> 02:03:10,113
She had had her puppies,
and she now took us to where they were

2265
02:03:10,113 --> 02:03:15,394
housed, in between the floor of a
building and the hollow ground.

2266
02:03:15,394 --> 02:03:18,069
Em’ly was seated on the whole litter.

2267
02:03:18,069 --> 02:03:21,821
“No,” I said to the Judge,
“I am not surprised.

2268
02:03:21,821 --> 02:03:23,415
She is capable of anything.”

2269
02:03:23,415 --> 02:03:27,232
In her new choice of offspring,
this hen had at length

2270
02:03:27,232 --> 02:03:29,152
encountered an unworthy parent.

2271
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:33,261
The setter was bored by her own puppies.

2272
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:39,591
She found the hole under the house an
obscure and monotonous residence

2273
02:03:39,591 --> 02:03:43,361
compared with the dining room,
and our company more stimulating and

2274
02:03:43,361 --> 02:03:46,135
sympathetic than that of her children.

2275
02:03:46,135 --> 02:03:51,857
A much-petted contact with our superior
race had developed her dog intelligence

2276
02:03:51,857 --> 02:03:55,217
above its natural level,
and turned her into an unnatural,

2277
02:03:55,217 --> 02:03:58,577
neglectful mother, who was constantly
forgetting her nursery

2278
02:03:58,577 --> 02:04:00,285
for worldly pleasures.

2279
02:04:00,285 --> 02:04:03,983
At certain periods of the day she
repaired to the puppies and fed them,

2280
02:04:03,983 --> 02:04:07,162
but came away when this perfunctory
ceremony was accomplished;

2281
02:04:07,162 --> 02:04:09,747
and she was glad enough to have a
governess bring them up.

2282
02:04:09,747 --> 02:04:12,418
She made no quarrel with Em’ly,
and the two understood

2283
02:04:12,418 --> 02:04:13,718
each other perfectly.

2284
02:04:13,718 --> 02:04:18,066
I have never seen among animals any
arrangement so civilized

2285
02:04:18,066 --> 02:04:19,759
and so perverted.

2286
02:04:19,759 --> 02:04:21,707
It made Em’ly perfectly happy.

2287
02:04:21,707 --> 02:04:26,247
To see her sitting all day jealously
spreading her wings over some blind

2288
02:04:26,247 --> 02:04:30,870
puppies was sufficiently curious;
but when they became large enough to

2289
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:35,297
come out from under the house and toddle
about in the proud hen’s wake,

2290
02:04:35,297 --> 02:04:39,439
I longed for some distinguished
naturalist.

2291
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:44,143
I felt that our ignorance made us
inappropriate spectators

2292
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:47,094
of such a phenomenon.

2293
02:04:47,094 --> 02:04:50,959
Em’ly scratched and clucked,
and the puppies ran to her,

2294
02:04:50,959 --> 02:04:55,543
pawed her with their fat limp little
legs, and retreated beneath her feathers

2295
02:04:55,543 --> 02:04:58,006
in their games of hide and seek.

2296
02:04:58,006 --> 02:05:03,024
Conceive, if you can,
what confusion must have reigned in

2297
02:05:03,024 --> 02:05:06,765
their infant minds as to
who the setter was!

2298
02:05:06,765 --> 02:05:10,220
“I reckon they think she’s the wet-
nurse,” said the Virginian.

2299
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:15,178
When the puppies grew to be boisterous,
I perceived that Em’ly’s mission

2300
02:05:15,178 --> 02:05:16,816
was approaching its end.

2301
02:05:16,816 --> 02:05:20,294
They were too heavy for her,
and their increasing scope of

2302
02:05:20,294 --> 02:05:22,518
playfulness was not in her line.

2303
02:05:22,518 --> 02:05:25,944
Once or twice they knocked her over,
upon which she arose and pecked them

2304
02:05:25,944 --> 02:05:29,998
severely, and they retired to a safe
distance, and sitting in a

2305
02:05:29,998 --> 02:05:31,768
circle, yapped at her.

2306
02:05:31,768 --> 02:05:37,911
I think they began to suspect that she
was only a hen after all.

2307
02:05:37,911 --> 02:05:42,890
So Em’ly resigned with an indifference
which surprised me, until I remembered

2308
02:05:42,890 --> 02:05:46,489
that if it had been chickens,
she would have ceased to look after

2309
02:05:46,489 --> 02:05:47,331
them by this time.

2310
02:05:47,331 --> 02:05:52,183
But here she was again “out of a job,”
as the Virginian said.

2311
02:05:52,183 --> 02:05:56,622
“She’s raised them puppies for that
triflin’ setter, and now she’ll be

2312
02:05:56,622 --> -1:59:59,000
huntin’ around for something else useful
to do that ain’t in her business.

2313
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2314
02:06:01,745 --> 02:06:06,271
Now there were other broods of chickens
to arrive in the henhouse,

2315
02:06:06,271 --> 02:06:11,028
and I did not desire any more
bantam and turkey performances.

2316
02:06:11,028 --> 02:06:15,139
So, to avoid confusion,
I played a trick upon Em’ly.

2317
02:06:15,139 --> 02:06:19,092
I went down to Sunk Creek and fetched
some smooth, oval stones.

2318
02:06:19,092 --> 02:06:23,805
She was quite satisfied with these,
and passed a quiet day with

2319
02:06:23,805 --> 02:06:25,168
them in a box.

2320
02:06:25,168 --> 02:06:28,409
This was not fair, the Virginian asserted.

2321
02:06:28,409 --> 02:06:33,170
“You ain’t going to jus’ leave her
fooled that a-way?”

2322
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:34,656
I did not see why not.

2323
02:06:34,656 --> 02:06:37,376
“Why, she raised them puppies all right.

2324
02:06:37,376 --> 02:06:40,760
Ain’t she showed she knows how to
be a mother anyways?

2325
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:44,080
Em’ly ain’t going to get her time took up
for nothing while I’m round

2326
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,910
hyeh,” said the cowpuncher.

2327
02:06:45,910 --> 02:06:49,099
He laid a gentle hold of Em’ly and tossed
her to the ground.

2328
02:06:49,099 --> 02:06:54,253
She, of course, rushed out among the
corrals in a great state of nerves.

2329
02:06:54,253 --> 02:06:58,290
“I don’t see what good you
do meddling,” I protested.

2330
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:02,617
To this he deigned no reply,
but removed the unresponsive

2331
02:07:02,617 --> 02:07:04,618
stones from the straw.

2332
02:07:04,618 --> 02:07:07,221
“Why, if they ain’t right warm!”

2333
02:07:07,221 --> 02:07:08,767
he exclaimed plaintively.

2334
02:07:08,767 --> 02:07:11,654
“The poor, deluded son-of-a-gun!”

2335
02:07:11,654 --> 02:07:16,737
And with this unusual description of a
lady, he sent the stones sailing like

2336
02:07:16,737 --> 02:07:18,243
a line of birds.

2337
02:07:18,243 --> 02:07:21,878
“I’m regular getting stuck on
Em’ly,” continued the Virginian.

2338
02:07:21,878 --> 02:07:23,885
“Yu’ needn’t to laugh.

2339
02:07:23,885 --> 02:07:27,693
Don’t yu’ see she’s got sort o’
human feelin’s and desires?

2340
02:07:27,693 --> 02:07:31,991
I always knowed hawsses was like people,
and my collie, of course.

2341
02:07:31,991 --> 02:07:35,471
It is kind of foolish,
I expect, but that hen’s goin’ to have a

2342
02:07:35,471 --> 02:07:38,779
real aigg directly, right
now, to set on.”

2343
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:41,707
With this he removed one
from beneath another hen.

2344
02:07:41,707 --> 02:07:45,552
“We’ll have Em’ly raise this hyeh,”
said he, “so she can put

2345
02:07:45,552 --> 02:07:47,119
in her time profitable.”

2346
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:51,539
It was not accomplished at once;
for Em’ly, singularly enough,

2347
02:07:51,539 --> 02:07:55,336
would not consent to stay in the box
whence she had been routed.

2348
02:07:55,336 --> 02:08:00,950
At length we found another retreat for
her, and in these new surroundings,

2349
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:05,549
with a new piece of work for her to do,
Em’ly sat on the one egg which the

2350
02:08:05,549 --> 02:08:08,453
Virginian had so carefully
provided for her.

2351
02:08:08,453 --> 02:08:15,762
Thus, as in all genuine tragedies,
was the stroke of Fate wrought by chance

2352
02:08:15,762 --> 02:08:17,682
and the best intentions.

2353
02:08:17,682 --> 02:08:22,389
Em’ly began sitting on
Friday afternoon near sundown.

2354
02:08:22,389 --> 02:08:26,956
Early next morning my sleep was gradually
dispersed by a sound

2355
02:08:26,956 --> 02:08:29,547
unearthly and continuous.

2356
02:08:29,547 --> 02:08:35,171
Now it dwindled, receding to a distance;
again it came near, took a turn,

2357
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:39,618
drifted to the other side of the house;
then, evidently, whatever it was,

2358
02:08:39,618 --> 02:08:42,221
passed my door close,
and I jumped upright in my bed.

2359
02:08:42,221 --> 02:08:47,839
The high, tense strain of vibration,
nearly, but not quite,

2360
02:08:47,839 --> 02:08:52,245
a musical note, was like the threatening
scream of machinery,

2361
02:08:52,245 --> 02:08:57,204
though weaker, and I bounded out of the
house in my pajamas.

2362
02:08:57,204 --> 02:09:01,894
There was Em’ly, dishevelled,
walking wildly about,

2363
02:09:01,894 --> 02:09:05,289
her one egg miraculously
hatched within ten hours.

2364
02:09:05,289 --> 02:09:09,110
The little lonely yellow ball of down
went cheeping along behind,

2365
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:11,430
following its mother as best it could.

2366
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:16,604
What, then, had happened to the
established period of incubation?

2367
02:09:16,604 --> 02:09:21,819
For an instant the thing was like a
portent, and I was near joining Em’ly in

2368
02:09:21,819 --> 02:09:25,797
her horrid surprise,
when I saw how it all was.

2369
02:09:25,797 --> 02:09:29,123
The Virginian had taken an egg from a hen
which had already been

2370
02:09:29,123 --> 02:09:30,774
sitting for three weeks.

2371
02:09:30,774 --> 02:09:34,719
I dressed in haste, hearing
Em’ly’s distracted outcry.

2372
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:40,221
It steadily sounded, without perceptible
pause for breath, and marked her erratic

2373
02:09:40,221 --> 02:09:44,895
journey back and forth through
stables, lanes, and corrals.

2374
02:09:44,895 --> 02:09:50,271
The shrill disturbance brought all of us
out to see her, and in the henhouse I

2375
02:09:50,271 --> 02:09:54,114
discovered the new brood
making its appearance punctually.

2376
02:09:54,114 --> 02:09:58,440
But this natural explanation could not be
made to the crazed hen.

2377
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:03,302
She continued to scour the premises,
her slant tail and its one preposterous

2378
02:10:03,302 --> 02:10:08,302
feather waving as she aimlessly went,
her stout legs stepping high with an

2379
02:10:08,302 --> 02:10:13,114
unnatural motion, her head lifted nearly
off her neck, and in her brilliant

2380
02:10:13,114 --> 02:10:21,193
yellow eye an expression of more than
outrage at this overturning

2381
02:10:21,193 --> 02:10:23,274
of a natural law.

2382
02:10:23,274 --> 02:10:28,943
Behind her, entirely ignored and
neglected, trailed the little progeny.

2383
02:10:28,943 --> 02:10:30,226
She never looked at it.

2384
02:10:30,226 --> 02:10:34,385
We went about our various affairs,
and all through the clear,

2385
02:10:34,385 --> 02:10:40,277
sunny day that unending metallic
scream pervaded the premises.

2386
02:10:40,277 --> 02:10:45,129
The Virginian put out food and water for
her, but she tasted nothing.

2387
02:10:45,129 --> 02:10:48,229
I am glad to say that
the little chicken did.

2388
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:52,149
I do not think that the hen’s eyes could
see, except in the way

2389
02:10:52,149 --> 02:10:53,870
that sleepwalkers’ do.

2390
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:57,029
The heat went out of the air,
and in the canyon the violet

2391
02:10:57,029 --> 02:10:58,608
light began to show.

2392
02:10:58,608 --> 02:11:03,384
Many hours had gone, but
Em’ly never ceased.

2393
02:11:03,384 --> 02:11:08,714
Now she suddenly flew up in a tree and
sat there with her noise still going;

2394
02:11:08,714 --> 02:11:16,279
but it had risen lately several notes
into a slim, acute level of terror,

2395
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:21,175
and was not like machinery any more,
nor like any sound I ever

2396
02:11:21,175 --> 02:11:23,512
heard before or since.

2397
02:11:23,512 --> 02:11:27,392
Below the tree stood the bewildered
little chicken, cheeping,

2398
02:11:27,392 --> 02:11:30,518
and making tiny jumps
to reach its mother.

2399
02:11:30,518 --> 02:11:34,536
“Yes,” said the Virginian, “it’s comical.

2400
02:11:34,536 --> 02:11:38,490
Even her aigg acted different
from anybody else’s.”

2401
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:43,386
He paused, and looked across the wide,
mellowing plain with the expression of

2402
02:11:43,386 --> 02:11:45,837
easygoing gravity so common with him.

2403
02:11:45,837 --> 02:11:49,066
Then he looked at Em’ly in the tree
and the yellow chicken.

2404
02:11:49,066 --> 02:11:51,586
“It ain’t so damned funny,” said he.

2405
02:11:51,586 --> 02:11:55,437
We went in to supper,
and I came out to find the hen lying

2406
02:11:55,437 --> 02:11:57,407
on the ground, dead.

2407
02:11:57,407 --> 02:12:00,538
I took the chicken to the
family in the henhouse.

2408
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:04,311
No, it was not altogether funny any more.

2409
02:12:04,311 --> 02:12:08,911
And I did not think less of the Virginian
when I came upon him surreptitiously

2410
02:12:08,911 --> 02:12:12,293
digging a little hole in
the field for her.

2411
02:12:12,293 --> 02:12:15,892
“I have buried some citizens here and
there,” said he, “that

2412
02:12:15,892 --> -1:59:59,000
I have respected less.

2413
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2414
02:12:17,918 --> 02:12:22,246
And when the time came for me to leave
Sunk Creek, my last word to the

2415
02:12:22,246 --> 02:12:24,846
Virginian was, “Don’t forget Em’ly.”

2416
02:12:24,846 --> 02:12:28,357
“I ain’t likely to,” responded
the cowpuncher.

2417
02:12:28,357 --> 02:12:31,863
“She is just one o’ them parables.”

2418
02:12:31,863 --> 02:12:36,236
Save when he fell into his native idioms
(which, they told me,

2419
02:12:36,236 --> 02:12:40,516
his wanderings had well-nigh obliterated
until that year’s visit to his home

2420
02:12:40,516 --> 02:12:46,164
again revived them in his speech),
he had now for a long while dropped the

2421
02:12:46,164 --> 02:12:49,380
“seh,” and all other barriers between
us.

2422
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:54,093
We were thorough friends,
and had exchanged many confidences both

2423
02:12:54,093 --> 02:12:55,874
of the flesh and of the spirit.

2424
02:12:55,874 --> 02:13:00,574
He even went the length of saying that he
would write me the Sunk Creek news if I

2425
02:13:00,574 --> 02:13:03,114
would send him a line now and then.

2426
02:13:03,114 --> 02:13:05,256
I have many letters from him now.

2427
02:13:05,256 --> 02:13:09,245
Their spelling came to be faultless,
and in the beginning was little

2428
02:13:09,245 --> 02:13:11,578
worse than George Washington’s.

2429
02:13:11,578 --> 02:13:15,856
The Judge himself drove me to the
railroad by another way⁠—across the Bow

2430
02:13:15,856 --> 02:13:21,212
Leg Mountains, and south through
Balaam’s Ranch and Drybone to Rock

2431
02:13:21,212 --> 02:13:22,172
Creek.

2432
02:13:22,172 --> 02:13:26,733
“I’ll be very homesick,” I told him.

2433
02:13:26,733 --> 02:13:32,985
“Come and pull the latchstring whenever
you please,” he bade me.

2434
02:13:32,985 --> 02:13:35,429
I wished that I might!

2435
02:13:35,429 --> 02:13:40,032
No lotus land ever cast its spell upon
man’s heart more than

2436
02:13:40,032 --> 02:13:41,832
Wyoming had enchanted mine.

2437
02:13:41,832 --> 02:13:43,192
CHAPTER VII

2438
02:13:43,192 --> 02:13:44,514
Through Two Snows

2439
02:13:44,514 --> 02:13:51,460
Dear Friend [thus in the spring the
Virginian wrote me], Yours received.

2440
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:53,963
It must be a poor thing to be sick.

2441
02:13:53,963 --> 02:13:58,024
That time I was shot at Cañada de Oro
would have made me sick if it had been a

2442
02:13:58,024 --> 02:14:00,904
littel lower or if I was much
of a drinking man.

2443
02:14:00,904 --> 02:14:05,002
You will be well if you give over city
life and take a hunt with me about

2444
02:14:05,002 --> 02:14:09,264
August or say September for then the elk
will be out of the velvett.

2445
02:14:09,264 --> 02:14:14,217
Things do not please me here just now and
I am going to settel it by vamosing.

2446
02:14:14,217 --> 02:14:15,671
But I would be glad to see you.

2447
02:14:15,671 --> 02:14:20,460
It would be pleasure not business for me
to show you plenty elk

2448
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:21,706
and get you strong.

2449
02:14:21,706 --> 02:14:26,133
I am not crybabying to the Judge or
making any kick about things.

2450
02:14:26,133 --> 02:14:31,153
He will want me back after he has
swallowed a litter tincture of time.

2451
02:14:31,153 --> 02:14:33,685
It is the best dose I know.

2452
02:14:33,685 --> 02:14:36,538
Now to answer your questions.

2453
02:14:36,538 --> 02:14:40,887
Yes the Emmily hen might have ate loco
weed if hens do.

2454
02:14:40,887 --> 02:14:45,783
I never saw anything but stock and horses
get poisoned with loco weed.

2455
02:14:45,783 --> 02:14:48,674
No the school is not built yet.

2456
02:14:48,674 --> 02:14:51,832
They are always big talkers on Bear Creek.

2457
02:14:51,832 --> 02:14:54,308
No I have not seen Steve.

2458
02:14:54,308 --> 02:14:58,102
He is around but I am sorry for him.

2459
02:14:58,102 --> 02:15:00,795
Yes I have been to Medicine Bow.

2460
02:15:00,795 --> 02:15:02,628
I had the welcom I wanted.

2461
02:15:02,628 --> 02:15:06,676
Do you remember a man I played poker and
he did not like it?

2462
02:15:06,676 --> 02:15:10,278
He is working on the upper
ranch near Ten Sleep.

2463
02:15:10,278 --> 02:15:13,978
He does not amount to a
thing except with weaklings.

2464
02:15:13,978 --> 02:15:16,956
Uncle Hewie has twins.

2465
02:15:16,956 --> 02:15:23,278
The boys got him vexed some about it,
but I think they are his.

2466
02:15:23,278 --> 02:15:27,397
Now that is all I know today and I would
like to see you poco presently as they

2467
02:15:27,397 --> 02:15:29,158
say at Los Cruces.

2468
02:15:29,158 --> 02:15:31,162
There’s no sense in you being sick.

2469
02:15:31,162 --> 02:15:34,628
The rest of this letter discussed the
best meeting point for us should I

2470
02:15:34,628 --> 02:15:36,572
decide to join him for a hunt.

2471
02:15:36,572 --> 02:15:41,332
That hunt was made, and during the weeks
of its duration something was said to

2472
02:15:41,332 --> 02:15:45,674
explain a little more fully the
Virginian’s difficulty at the Sunk Creek

2473
02:15:45,674 --> 02:15:49,684
Ranch, and his reason for leaving his
excellent employer the Judge.

2474
02:15:49,684 --> 02:15:55,147
Not much was said, to be sure;
the Virginian seldom spent many words

2475
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,427
upon his own troubles.

2476
02:15:56,427 --> 02:16:00,707
But it appeared that owing to some
jealousy of him on the part of the

2477
02:16:00,707 --> 02:16:04,947
foreman, or the assistant foreman,
he found himself continually doing

2478
02:16:04,947 --> 02:16:09,507
another man’s work, but under
circumstances so skilfully arranged that

2479
02:16:09,507 --> 02:16:11,660
he got neither credit nor pay for it.

2480
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:14,289
He would not stoop to telling
tales out of school.

2481
02:16:14,289 --> 02:16:20,087
Therefore his ready and prophetic mind
devised the simple expedient

2482
02:16:20,087 --> 02:16:21,915
of going away altogether.

2483
02:16:21,915 --> 02:16:26,948
He calculated that Judge Henry would
gradually perceive there was a

2484
02:16:26,948 --> 02:16:32,210
connection between his departure and the
cessation of the satisfactory work.

2485
02:16:32,210 --> 02:16:38,237
After a judicious interval it was his
plan to appear again in the neighborhood

2486
02:16:38,237 --> 02:16:40,957
of Sunk Creek and await results.

2487
02:16:40,957 --> 02:16:44,523
Concerning Steve he would say no more
than he had written.

2488
02:16:44,523 --> 02:16:48,898
But it was plain that for some cause
this friendship had ceased.

2489
02:16:48,898 --> 02:16:53,812
Money for his services during the hunt he
positively declined to accept,

2490
02:16:53,812 --> 02:16:56,827
asserting that he had not worked enough
to earn his board.

2491
02:16:56,827 --> 02:17:01,231
And the expedition ended in an
untravelled corner of the Yellowstone

2492
02:17:01,231 --> 02:17:07,305
Park, near Pitchstone Canyon,
where he and young Lin McLean and others

2493
02:17:07,305 --> 02:17:12,178
were witnesses of a sad and terrible
drama that has been elsewhere

2494
02:17:12,178 --> 02:17:12,912
chronicled.

2495
02:17:12,912 --> 02:17:19,706
His prophetic mind had foreseen correctly
the shape of events at Sunk Creek.

2496
02:17:19,706 --> 02:17:23,562
The only thing that it had not foreseen
was the impression to be made upon the

2497
02:17:23,562 --> 02:17:25,673
Judge’s mind by his conduct.

2498
02:17:25,673 --> 02:17:31,134
Toward the close of that winter,
Judge and Mrs. Henry visited the East.

2499
02:17:31,134 --> 02:17:33,869
Through them a number
of things became revealed.

2500
02:17:33,869 --> 02:17:36,454
The Virginian was back at Sunk Creek.

2501
02:17:36,454 --> 02:17:40,654
“And,” said Mrs. Henry,
“he would never have left you if I had

2502
02:17:40,654 --> 02:17:43,967
had my way, Judge H.!”

2503
02:17:43,967 --> 02:17:49,217
“No, Madam Judge,” retorted her husband;
“I am aware of that.

2504
02:17:49,217 --> 02:17:52,516
For you have always appreciated a fine
appearance in a man.”

2505
02:17:52,516 --> 02:17:56,998
“I certainly have,” confessed
the lady, mirthfully.

2506
02:17:56,998 --> 02:18:01,751
“And the way he used to come bringing my
horse, with the ridges of his black hair

2507
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:05,910
so carefully brushed and that blue
spotted handkerchief tied so effectively

2508
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:12,070
round his throat, was something that I
missed a great deal after he went away.”

2509
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:17,005
“Thank you, my dear, for this warning.

2510
02:18:17,005 --> 02:18:22,422
I have plans that will keep him absent
quite constantly for the future.”

2511
02:18:22,422 --> 02:18:25,105
And then they spoke less flightily.

2512
02:18:25,105 --> 02:18:28,292
“I always knew,” said the lady,
“that you had found a treasure

2513
02:18:28,292 --> 02:18:29,467
when that man came.”

2514
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:30,572
The Judge laughed.

2515
02:18:30,572 --> 02:18:34,464
“When it dawned on me,”
he said, “how cleverly he caused me to

2516
02:18:34,464 --> 02:18:38,820
learn the value of his services by
depriving me of them,

2517
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:41,846
I doubted whether it was safe
to take him back.”

2518
02:18:41,846 --> 02:18:42,719
“Safe!”

2519
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:44,076
cried Mrs. Henry.

2520
02:18:44,076 --> 02:18:45,721
“Safe, my dear.

2521
02:18:45,721 --> 02:18:50,065
Because I’m afraid he is pretty nearly as
shrewd as I am.

2522
02:18:50,065 --> 02:18:52,379
And that’s rather dangerous
in a subordinate.”

2523
02:18:52,379 --> 02:18:53,623
The Judge laughed again.

2524
02:18:53,623 --> 02:18:58,300
“But his action regarding the man they
call Steve has made me feel easy.”

2525
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:02,120
And then it came out that the Virginian
was supposed to have discovered in some

2526
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:07,445
way that Steve had fallen from the grace
of that particular honesty which

2527
02:19:07,445 --> 02:19:10,651
respects another man’s cattle.

2528
02:19:10,651 --> 02:19:13,179
It was not known for certain.

2529
02:19:13,179 --> 02:19:19,278
But calves had begun to disappear in
Cattle Land, and cows

2530
02:19:19,278 --> 02:19:21,494
had been found killed.

2531
02:19:21,494 --> 02:19:26,689
And calves with one brand upon them had
been found with mothers that bore the

2532
02:19:26,689 --> 02:19:28,601
brand of another owner.

2533
02:19:28,601 --> 02:19:33,150
This industry was taking root in Cattle
Land, and of those who practised it,

2534
02:19:33,150 --> 02:19:35,167
some were beginning to be suspected.

2535
02:19:35,167 --> 02:19:38,072
Steve was not quite fully suspected yet.

2536
02:19:38,072 --> 02:19:42,831
But that the Virginian had parted company
with him was definitely known.

2537
02:19:42,831 --> 02:19:44,780
And neither man would talk about it.

2538
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:50,214
There was the further news that the Bear
Creek schoolhouse at length stood

2539
02:19:50,214 --> 02:19:55,064
complete, floor, walls,
and roof; and that a lady from

2540
02:19:55,064 --> 02:19:59,864
Bennington, Vermont,
a friend of Mrs. Balaam’s,

2541
02:19:59,864 --> 02:20:03,772
had quite suddenly decided that she
would try her hand at

2542
02:20:03,772 --> 02:20:06,457
instructing the new generation.

2543
02:20:06,457 --> 02:20:11,729
The Judge and Mrs. Henry knew this
because Mrs. Balaam had told them of her

2544
02:20:11,729 --> 02:20:15,649
disappointment that she would be absent
from the ranch on Butte Creek when her

2545
02:20:15,649 --> 02:20:19,295
friend arrived, and therefore
unable to entertain her.

2546
02:20:19,295 --> 02:20:23,946
The friend’s decision had been quite
suddenly made, and must form the subject

2547
02:20:23,946 --> 02:20:25,142
of the next chapter.

2548
02:20:25,142 --> 02:20:26,230
CHAPTER VIII

2549
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:27,683
The Sincere Spinster

2550
02:20:27,683 --> 02:20:31,764
I do not know with which of
the two estimates⁠—Mr.

2551
02:20:31,764 --> 02:20:35,151
Taylor’s or the Virginian’s⁠—you agreed.

2552
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:39,693
Did you think that Miss Mary Stark Wood
of Bennington, Vermont,

2553
02:20:39,693 --> 02:20:41,824
was forty years of age?

2554
02:20:41,824 --> 02:20:44,327
That would have been an error.

2555
02:20:44,327 --> 02:20:48,727
At the time she wrote the letter to Mrs.
Balaam, of which letter certain portions

2556
02:20:48,727 --> 02:20:53,333
have been quoted in these pages,
she was in her twenty-first year;

2557
02:20:53,333 --> 02:20:56,182
or, to be more precise,
she had been twenty some

2558
02:20:56,182 --> 02:20:57,582
eight months previous.

2559
02:20:57,582 --> 02:21:03,502
Now, it is not usual for young ladies of
twenty to contemplate a journey of

2560
02:21:03,502 --> 02:21:09,522
nearly two thousand miles to a country
where Indians and wild animals live

2561
02:21:09,522 --> 02:21:15,755
unchained, unless they are to make such
journey in company with a protector,

2562
02:21:15,755 --> 02:21:22,461
or are going to a protector’s arms
at the other end.

2563
02:21:22,461 --> 02:21:30,006
Nor is school teaching on Bear Creek a
usual ambition for such young ladies.

2564
02:21:30,006 --> 02:21:35,142
But Miss Mary Stark Wood was not a usual
young lady for two reasons.

2565
02:21:35,142 --> 02:21:37,561
First, there was her descent.

2566
02:21:37,561 --> 02:21:41,848
Had she so wished, she could have
belonged to any number of those

2567
02:21:41,848 --> 02:21:46,295
patriotic societies of which our
American ears have grown accustomed

2568
02:21:46,295 --> 02:21:47,704
to hear so much.

2569
02:21:47,704 --> 02:21:51,646
She could have been enrolled in the
Boston Tea Party, the Ethan Allen

2570
02:21:51,646 --> 02:21:57,194
Ticonderogas, the Green Mountain
Daughters, the Saratoga Sacred Circle,

2571
02:21:57,194 --> 02:22:00,561
and the Confederated
Colonial Chatelaines.

2572
02:22:00,561 --> 02:22:04,987
She traced direct descent from the
historic lady whose name she bore,

2573
02:22:04,987 --> 02:22:09,556
that Molly Stark who was not a widow
after the battle where her lord,

2574
02:22:09,556 --> 02:22:15,538
her Captain John, battled so bravely as
to send his name thrilling down through

2575
02:22:15,538 --> 02:22:19,500
the blood of generations of schoolboys.

2576
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:25,538
This ancestress was her chief claim to be
a member of those shining societies

2577
02:22:25,538 --> 02:22:26,985
which I have enumerated.

2578
02:22:26,985 --> 02:22:31,945
But she had been willing to join none of
them, although invitations to do so were

2579
02:22:31,945 --> 02:22:33,680
by no means lacking.

2580
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:35,731
I cannot tell you her reason.

2581
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:37,729
Still, I can tell you this.

2582
02:22:37,729 --> 02:22:41,649
When these societies were much spoken of
in her presence, her very sprightly

2583
02:22:41,649 --> 02:22:46,170
countenance became more sprightly,
and she added her words of praise or

2584
02:22:46,170 --> 02:22:48,745
respect to the general chorus.

2585
02:22:48,745 --> 02:22:52,179
But when she received an invitation to
join one of these bodies,

2586
02:22:52,179 --> 02:22:55,835
her countenance, as she read the
missive, would assume an expression

2587
02:22:55,835 --> 02:23:00,462
which was known to her friends as
“sticking her nose in the air.”

2588
02:23:00,462 --> 02:23:04,360
I do not think that Molly’s reason for
refusing to join could have been

2589
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:05,438
a truly good one.

2590
02:23:05,438 --> 02:23:09,480
I should add that her most precious
possession⁠—a treasure which accompanied

2591
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:14,316
her even if she went away for only one
night’s absence⁠—was an heirloom,

2592
02:23:14,316 --> 02:23:19,074
a little miniature portrait of the old
Molly Stark, painted when that far-off

2593
02:23:19,074 --> 02:23:22,218
dame must have been scarce
more than twenty.

2594
02:23:22,218 --> 02:23:27,693
And when each summer the young Molly went
to Dunbarton, New Hampshire,

2595
02:23:27,693 --> 02:23:34,100
to pay her established family visit to
the last survivors of her connection who

2596
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:38,580
bore the name of Stark,
no word that she heard in the Dunbarton

2597
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:44,745
houses pleased her so much as when a
certain great-aunt would take her by the

2598
02:23:44,745 --> 02:23:49,488
hand, and, after looking with fond
intentness at her, pronounce:⁠—

2599
02:23:49,488 --> -1:59:59,000
“My dear, you’re getting more like the
General’s wife every year you live.

2600
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2601
02:23:56,102 --> 02:23:59,904
“I suppose you mean my nose,”
Molly would then reply.

2602
02:23:59,904 --> 02:24:02,346
“Nonsense, child.

2603
02:24:02,346 --> 02:24:05,946
You have the family length of nose,
and I’ve never heard that

2604
02:24:05,946 --> 02:24:07,233
it has disgraced us.”

2605
02:24:07,233 --> 02:24:09,674
“But I don’t think I’m
tall enough for it.”

2606
02:24:09,674 --> 02:24:13,233
“There now, run to your room,
and dress for tea.

2607
02:24:13,233 --> -1:59:59,000
The Starks have always been punctual.

2608
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2609
02:24:15,643 --> 02:24:19,691
And after this annual conversation,
Molly would run to her room,

2610
02:24:19,691 --> 02:24:23,961
and there in its privacy,
even at the risk of falling below the

2611
02:24:23,961 --> 02:24:29,089
punctuality of the Starks,
she would consult two objects for quite

2612
02:24:29,089 --> 02:24:31,801
a minute before she began to dress.

2613
02:24:31,801 --> 02:24:36,646
These objects, as you have already
correctly guessed, were the miniature of

2614
02:24:36,646 --> 02:24:40,088
the General’s wife and the looking
glass.

2615
02:24:40,088 --> 02:24:44,081
So much for Miss Molly
Stark Wood’s descent.

2616
02:24:44,081 --> 02:24:48,797
The second reason why she was not a usual
girl was her character.

2617
02:24:48,797 --> 02:24:55,246
This character was the result of pride
and family pluck battling

2618
02:24:55,246 --> 02:24:56,782
with family hardship.

2619
02:24:56,782 --> 02:25:01,046
Just one year before she was to be
presented to the world⁠—not the great

2620
02:25:01,046 --> 02:25:04,766
metropolitan world, but a world that
would have made her welcome and done her

2621
02:25:04,766 --> 02:25:10,749
homage at its little dances and little
dinners in Troy and Rutland and

2622
02:25:10,749 --> 02:25:16,130
Burlington⁠—fortune had turned her
back upon the Woods.

2623
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:19,809
Their possessions had never been great
ones; but they had sufficed.

2624
02:25:19,809 --> 02:25:24,679
From generation to generation the family
had gone to school like gentlefolk,

2625
02:25:24,679 --> 02:25:29,720
dressed like gentlefolk,
used the speech and ways of gentlefolk,

2626
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:32,698
and as gentlefolk lived and died.

2627
02:25:32,698 --> 02:25:34,832
And now the mills failed.

2628
02:25:34,832 --> 02:25:39,694
Instead of thinking about her first
evening dress, Molly found pupils to

2629
02:25:39,694 --> 02:25:41,986
whom she could give music lessons.

2630
02:25:41,986 --> 02:25:45,641
She found handkerchiefs that she
could embroider with initials.

2631
02:25:45,641 --> 02:25:49,740
And she found fruit that she
could make into preserves.

2632
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:54,060
That machine called the typewriter was
then in existence, but the day of women

2633
02:25:54,060 --> 02:25:59,017
typewriters had as yet scarcely begun to
dawn, else I think Molly would have

2634
02:25:59,017 --> 02:26:03,094
preferred this occupation to the
handkerchiefs and the preserves.

2635
02:26:03,094 --> 02:26:07,616
There were people in Bennington who
“wondered how Miss Wood could go about

2636
02:26:07,616 --> 02:26:12,357
from house to house teaching the piano,
and she a lady.”

2637
02:26:12,357 --> 02:26:17,117
There always have been such people,
I suppose, because the world must always

2638
02:26:17,117 --> 02:26:18,321
have a rubbish heap.

2639
02:26:18,321 --> 02:26:23,002
But we need not dwell upon them further
than to mention one other remark

2640
02:26:23,002 --> 02:26:26,230
of theirs regarding Molly.

2641
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:31,821
They all with one voice declared that Sam
Bannett was good enough for anybody who

2642
02:26:31,821 --> 02:26:36,296
did fancy embroidery at
five cents a letter.

2643
02:26:36,296 --> 02:26:41,034
“I dare say he had a great-grandmother
quite as good as hers,”

2644
02:26:41,034 --> 02:26:45,282
remarked Mrs. Flynt,
the wife of the Baptist minister.

2645
02:26:45,282 --> 02:26:50,111
“That’s entirely possible,”
returned the Episcopal rector of Hoosic,

2646
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:53,275
“only we don’t happen to
know who she was.”

2647
02:26:53,275 --> 02:26:55,484
The rector was a friend of Molly’s.

2648
02:26:55,484 --> 02:26:58,828
After this little observation,
Mrs. Flynt said no more,

2649
02:26:58,828 --> 02:27:03,865
but continued her purchases in the store
where she and the rector had happened

2650
02:27:03,865 --> 02:27:05,511
to find themselves together.

2651
02:27:05,511 --> 02:27:11,810
Later she stated to a friend that she had
always thought the Episcopal Church a

2652
02:27:11,810 --> 02:27:14,585
snobbish one, and now she knew it.

2653
02:27:14,585 --> 02:27:19,669
So public opinion went on being
indignant over Molly’s conduct.

2654
02:27:19,669 --> 02:27:23,296
She could stoop to work for money,
and yet she pretended to hold herself

2655
02:27:23,296 --> 02:27:28,918
above the most rising young man in
Hoosic Falls, and all just because there

2656
02:27:28,918 --> 02:27:31,795
was a difference in their grandmothers!

2657
02:27:31,795 --> 02:27:35,702
Was this the reason at the bottom of it?

2658
02:27:35,702 --> 02:27:37,455
The very bottom?

2659
02:27:37,455 --> 02:27:41,865
I cannot be certain, because I have never
been a girl myself.

2660
02:27:41,865 --> 02:27:45,906
Perhaps she thought that work is not a
stooping, and that marriage may be.

2661
02:27:45,906 --> 02:27:50,945
Perhaps⁠—But all I really know is that
Molly Wood continued cheerfully to

2662
02:27:50,945 --> 02:27:54,836
embroider the handkerchiefs,
make the preserves, teach the pupils⁠—

2663
02:27:54,836 --> 02:27:57,676
and firmly to reject Sam Bannett.

2664
02:27:57,676 --> 02:28:00,704
Thus it went on until she was twenty.

2665
02:28:00,704 --> 02:28:05,297
There certain members of her family began
to tell her how rich Sam was going to

2666
02:28:05,297 --> 02:28:07,640
be⁠—was, indeed, already.

2667
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:14,900
It was at this time that she wrote Mrs.
Balaam her doubts and her desires as to

2668
02:28:14,900 --> 02:28:16,740
migrating to Bear Creek.

2669
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:20,780
It was at this time also that her face
grew a little paler,

2670
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:25,535
and her friends thought that she was
overworked, and Mrs. Flynt feared she

2671
02:28:25,535 --> 02:28:26,631
was losing her looks.

2672
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:29,795
It was at this time, too,
that she grew very intimate with that

2673
02:28:29,795 --> 02:28:32,845
great-aunt over at Dunbarton,
and from her received

2674
02:28:32,845 --> 02:28:34,606
much comfort and strengthening.

2675
02:28:34,606 --> 02:28:36,024
“Never!”

2676
02:28:36,024 --> 02:28:38,860
said the old lady, “especially if
you can’t love him.”

2677
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:42,871
“I do like him,” said Molly;
“and he is very kind.”

2678
02:28:42,871 --> 02:28:44,531
“Never!”

2679
02:28:44,531 --> 02:28:45,465
said the old lady again.

2680
02:28:45,465 --> 02:28:50,196
“When I die, you’ll have something⁠—and
that will not be long now.”

2681
02:28:50,196 --> 02:28:55,216
Molly flung her arms around her aunt,
and stopped her words with a kiss.

2682
02:28:55,216 --> 02:28:59,889
And then one winter afternoon,
two years later, came the last straw.

2683
02:28:59,889 --> 02:29:02,093
The front door of the old house had shut.

2684
02:29:02,093 --> 02:29:04,978
Out of it had stepped
the persistent suitor.

2685
02:29:04,978 --> 02:29:05,618
Mrs.

2686
02:29:05,618 --> 02:29:10,453
Flynt watched him drive away
in his smart sleigh.

2687
02:29:10,453 --> 02:29:12,210
“That girl is a fool!”

2688
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:16,335
she said furiously; and she came away
from her bedroom window where she had

2689
02:29:16,335 --> 02:29:18,332
posted herself for observation.

2690
02:29:18,332 --> 02:29:23,124
Inside the old house a door had also shut.

2691
02:29:23,124 --> 02:29:25,924
This was the door of Molly’s own room.

2692
02:29:25,924 --> 02:29:29,034
And there she sat, in floods of tears.

2693
02:29:29,034 --> 02:29:33,696
For she could not bear to hurt a man who
loved her with all the power of love

2694
02:29:33,696 --> 02:29:35,216
that was in him.

2695
02:29:35,216 --> 02:29:38,936
It was about twilight when her door
opened, and an elderly

2696
02:29:38,936 --> 02:29:40,995
lady came softly in.

2697
02:29:40,995 --> 02:29:44,137
“My dear,” she ventured,
“and you were not able⁠—”

2698
02:29:44,137 --> 02:29:46,173
“Oh, mother!”

2699
02:29:46,173 --> 02:29:48,896
cried the girl, “have you come
to say that too?”

2700
02:29:48,896 --> 02:29:51,259
The next day Miss Wood
had become very hard.

2701
02:29:51,259 --> 02:29:55,240
In three weeks she had accepted the
position on Bear Creek.

2702
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:58,173
In two months she started,
heart-heavy, but with a

2703
02:29:58,173 --> 02:29:59,920
spirit craving the unknown.

2704
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:00,693
CHAPTER IX

2705
02:30:00,693 --> 02:30:02,791
The Spinster Meets the Unknown

2706
02:30:02,791 --> 02:30:06,933
On a Monday noon a small company of
horsemen strung out along the trail from

2707
02:30:06,933 --> 02:30:11,205
Sunk Creek to gather cattle over their
allotted sweep of range.

2708
02:30:11,205 --> 02:30:15,778
Spring was backward, and they,
as they rode galloping and gathering

2709
02:30:15,778 --> 02:30:20,709
upon the cold week’s work,
cursed cheerily and occasionally sang.

2710
02:30:20,709 --> 02:30:25,982
The Virginian was grave in bearing and of
infrequent speech; but he kept a song

2711
02:30:25,982 --> 02:30:29,360
going⁠—a matter of some
seventy-nine verses.

2712
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:33,204
Seventy-eight were quite unprintable,
and rejoiced his brother

2713
02:30:33,204 --> 02:30:35,847
cowpunchers monstrously.

2714
02:30:35,847 --> 02:30:40,249
They, knowing him to be a singular man,
forebore ever to press him,

2715
02:30:40,249 --> 02:30:43,758
and awaited his own humor,
lest he should weary of the lyric;

2716
02:30:43,758 --> 02:30:47,681
and when after a day of silence
apparently saturnine,

2717
02:30:47,681 --> 02:30:50,497
he would lift his gentle
voice and begin:⁠—

2718
02:30:50,497 --> 02:30:55,483
“If you go to monkey with my Looloo girl,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do:I’ll cyarve

2719
02:30:55,483 --> 02:30:58,994
your heart with my razor,
andI’ll shoot you with my pistol, too⁠—”

2720
02:30:58,994 --> 02:31:03,435
then they would stridently take up each
last line, and keep it going three,

2721
02:31:03,435 --> 02:31:09,296
four, ten times, and kick holes in the
ground to the swing of it.

2722
02:31:09,296 --> 02:31:18,295
By the levels of Bear Creek that reach
like inlets among the promontories of

2723
02:31:18,295 --> 02:31:23,379
the lonely hills, they came upon the
schoolhouse, roofed and ready for the

2724
02:31:23,379 --> 02:31:25,733
first native Wyoming crop.

2725
02:31:25,733 --> 02:31:29,819
It symbolized the dawn of a neighborhood,
and it brought a change

2726
02:31:29,819 --> 02:31:32,076
into the wilderness air.

2727
02:31:32,076 --> 02:31:35,837
The feel of it struck cold upon the free
spirits of the cowpunchers,

2728
02:31:35,837 --> 02:31:39,202
and they told each other that,
what with women and children and wire

2729
02:31:39,202 --> 02:31:43,213
fences, this country would not long be
a country for men.

2730
02:31:43,213 --> 02:31:45,986
They stopped for a meal
at an old comrade’s.

2731
02:31:45,986 --> 02:31:49,599
They looked over his gate,
and there he was pattering

2732
02:31:49,599 --> 02:31:51,181
among garden furrows.

2733
02:31:51,181 --> 02:31:52,639
“Pickin’ nosegays?”

2734
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:56,601
inquired the Virginian and the old
comrade asked if they could not

2735
02:31:56,601 --> 02:31:59,666
recognize potatoes except in the dish.

2736
02:31:59,666 --> 02:32:04,724
But he grinned sheepishly at them,
too, because they knew that he had not

2737
02:32:04,724 --> 02:32:06,727
always lived in a garden.

2738
02:32:06,727 --> 02:32:10,044
Then he took them into his house,
where they saw an object crawling on the

2739
02:32:10,044 --> 02:32:12,670
floor with a handful of sulphur matches.

2740
02:32:12,670 --> 02:32:17,296
He began to remove the matches,
but stopped in alarm at the vociferous

2741
02:32:17,296 --> 02:32:20,737
result; and his wife looked in from the
kitchen to caution him

2742
02:32:20,737 --> 02:32:22,885
about humoring little Christopher.

2743
02:32:22,885 --> 02:32:27,268
When she beheld the matches she was
aghast but when she saw her baby grow

2744
02:32:27,268 --> 02:32:31,219
quiet in the arms of the Virginian,
she smiled at that cowpuncher and

2745
02:32:31,219 --> 02:32:32,525
returned to her kitchen.

2746
02:32:32,525 --> 02:32:34,954
Then the Virginian slowly spoke again:⁠—

2747
02:32:34,954 --> 02:32:38,436
“How many little strangers
have yu’ got, James?”

2748
02:32:38,436 --> 02:32:39,382
“Only two.”

2749
02:32:39,382 --> 02:32:39,970
“My!

2750
02:32:39,970 --> 02:32:42,158
Ain’t it most three years
since yu’ maried?

2751
02:32:42,158 --> -1:59:59,000
Yu’ mustn’t let time creep
ahaid o’ yu’, James.

2752
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2753
02:32:47,728 --> 02:32:52,009
The father once more grinned at his
guests, who themselves turned sheepish

2754
02:32:52,009 --> 02:32:57,655
and polite; for Mrs. Westfall came in,
brisk and hearty, and set the

2755
02:32:57,655 --> 02:32:58,976
meat upon the table.

2756
02:32:58,976 --> 02:33:01,667
After that, it was she who talked.

2757
02:33:01,667 --> 02:33:06,943
The guests ate scrupulously,
muttering, “Yes, ma’am,”

2758
02:33:06,943 --> 02:33:12,017
and “No, ma’am,” in their plates,
while their hostess told them of

2759
02:33:12,017 --> 02:33:17,781
increasing families upon Bear Creek,
and the expected schoolteacher,

2760
02:33:17,781 --> 02:33:25,154
and little Alfred’s early teething,
and how it was time for all of them to

2761
02:33:25,154 --> 02:33:28,325
become husbands like James.

2762
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:33,240
The bachelors of the saddle listened,
always diffident, but eating heartily to

2763
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:44,972
the end; and soon after they rode away
in a thoughtful clump.

2764
02:33:44,972 --> 02:33:49,095
The wives of Bear Creek were few as yet,
and the homes scattered;

2765
02:33:49,095 --> 02:33:55,439
the schoolhouse was only a sprig on the
vast face of a world of elk and bear and

2766
02:33:55,439 --> 02:34:00,280
uncertain Indians; but that night,
when the earth near the fire was

2767
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:05,332
littered with the cowpunchers’ beds,
the Virginian was heard drawling to

2768
02:34:05,332 --> 02:34:07,892
himself: “Alfred and Christopher.

2769
02:34:07,892 --> 02:34:09,217
Oh, sugar!”

2770
02:34:09,217 --> 02:34:13,213
They found pleasure in the delicately
chosen shade of this oath.

2771
02:34:13,213 --> 02:34:18,133
He also recited to them a new verse about
how he took his Looloo girl to the

2772
02:34:18,133 --> 02:34:23,326
schoolhouse for to learn her A.B.C.;
and as it was quite original and

2773
02:34:23,326 --> 02:34:28,126
unprintable, the camp laughed and swore
joyfully, and rolled in its blankets to

2774
02:34:28,126 --> 02:34:29,897
sleep under the stars.

2775
02:34:29,897 --> 02:34:35,241
Upon a Monday noon likewise (for things
will happen so) some tearful people in

2776
02:34:35,241 --> 02:34:39,002
petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a
train that was just leaving

2777
02:34:39,002 --> 02:34:40,208
Bennington, Vermont.

2778
02:34:40,208 --> 02:34:44,698
A girl’s face smiled back at them once,
and withdrew quickly,

2779
02:34:44,698 --> 02:34:47,096
for they must not see the smile die
away.

2780
02:34:47,096 --> 02:34:51,628
She had with her a little money,
a few clothes, and in her mind a rigid

2781
02:34:51,628 --> 02:34:57,932
determination neither to be a burden to
her mother nor to give in

2782
02:34:57,932 --> 02:35:00,557
to that mother’s desires.

2783
02:35:00,557 --> 02:35:06,005
Absence alone would enable her to
carry out this determination.

2784
02:35:06,005 --> 02:35:10,096
Beyond these things, she possessed not
much except spelling-books,

2785
02:35:10,096 --> 02:35:13,764
a colonial miniature,
and that craving for the unknown

2786
02:35:13,764 --> 02:35:15,500
which has been mentioned.

2787
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:22,243
If the ancestors that we carry shut up
inside us take turns in dictating to us

2788
02:35:22,243 --> 02:35:27,396
our actions and our state of mind,
undoubtedly Grandmother Stark was

2789
02:35:27,396 --> 02:35:31,036
empress of Molly’s spirit
upon this Monday.

2790
02:35:31,036 --> 02:35:36,990
At Hoosic Junction, which came soon,
she passed the up-train bound back to

2791
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:41,000
her home, and seeing the engineer and
the conductor⁠—faces that she knew

2792
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:45,184
well⁠—her courage nearly failed her,
and she shut her eyes against this

2793
02:35:45,184 --> 02:35:49,128
glimpse of the familiar things
that she was leaving.

2794
02:35:49,128 --> 02:35:53,265
To keep herself steady she gripped
tightly a little bunch of

2795
02:35:53,265 --> 02:35:54,742
flowers in her hand.

2796
02:35:54,742 --> 02:35:59,825
But something caused her eyes to open;
and there before her stood Sam Bannett,

2797
02:35:59,825 --> 02:36:03,945
asking if he might accompany her so
far as Rotterdam Junction.

2798
02:36:03,945 --> 02:36:04,613
“No!”

2799
02:36:04,613 --> 02:36:08,685
she told him with a severity born from
the struggle she was

2800
02:36:08,685 --> 02:36:09,932
making with her grief.

2801
02:36:09,932 --> 02:36:11,685
“Not a mile with me.

2802
02:36:11,685 --> 02:36:14,208
Not to Eagle Bridge.

2803
02:36:14,208 --> -1:59:59,000
Goodbye.

2804
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2805
02:36:16,528 --> 02:36:19,670
And Sam⁠—what did he do?

2806
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:22,411
He obeyed her, I should like to
be sorry for him.

2807
02:36:22,411 --> 02:36:25,931
But obedience was not a lover’s part here.

2808
02:36:25,931 --> 02:36:30,158
He hesitated, the golden moment hung
hovering, the conductor

2809
02:36:30,158 --> 02:36:32,534
cried “All aboard!”

2810
02:36:32,534 --> 02:36:38,035
the train went, and there on the platform
stood obedient Sam, with his golden

2811
02:36:38,035 --> 02:36:39,602
moment gone like a butterfly.

2812
02:36:39,602 --> 02:36:42,887
After Rotterdam Junction,
which was some forty minutes farther,

2813
02:36:42,887 --> 02:36:47,321
Molly Wood sat bravely up in the through
car, dwelling upon the unknown.

2814
02:36:47,321 --> 02:36:51,368
She thought that she had attained it in
Ohio, on Tuesday morning,

2815
02:36:51,368 --> 02:36:53,477
and wrote a letter about
it to Bennington.

2816
02:36:53,477 --> 02:36:57,479
On Wednesday afternoon she felt sure,
and wrote a letter much more

2817
02:36:57,479 --> 02:36:58,796
picturesque.

2818
02:36:58,796 --> 02:37:03,023
But on the following day,
after breakfast at North Platte,

2819
02:37:03,023 --> 02:37:07,963
Nebraska, she wrote a very long letter
indeed, and told them that she had seen

2820
02:37:07,963 --> 02:37:13,206
a black pig on a white pile of buffalo
bones, catching drops of water in the

2821
02:37:13,206 --> 02:37:17,420
air as they fell from the railroad tank.

2822
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:20,937
She also wrote that trees
were extraordinarily scarce.

2823
02:37:20,937 --> 02:37:27,470
Each hour westward from the pig confirmed
this opinion, and when she left the

2824
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:32,810
train at Rock Creek,
late upon that fourth night⁠—in those

2825
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:37,370
days the trains were slower⁠—she knew
that she had really attained the

2826
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:43,153
unknown, and sent an expensive telegram
to say that she was quite well.

2827
02:37:43,153 --> 02:37:47,054
At six in the morning the stage drove
away into the sagebrush,

2828
02:37:47,054 --> 02:37:50,914
with her as its only passenger;
and by sundown she had passed through

2829
02:37:50,914 --> 02:37:52,990
some of the primitive
perils of the world.

2830
02:37:52,990 --> 02:37:58,719
The second team, virgin to harness,
and displeased with this novelty,

2831
02:37:58,719 --> 02:38:02,292
tried to take it off,
and went down to the bottom of a gully

2832
02:38:02,292 --> 02:38:05,989
on its eight hind legs,
while Miss Wood sat mute and

2833
02:38:05,989 --> 02:38:07,788
unflinching beside the driver.

2834
02:38:07,788 --> 02:38:13,812
Therefore he, when it was over,
and they on the proper road again,

2835
02:38:13,812 --> 02:38:19,053
invited her earnestly to be his wife
during many of the next fifteen miles,

2836
02:38:19,053 --> 02:38:24,454
and told her of his snug cabin and his
horses and his mine.

2837
02:38:24,454 --> 02:38:30,839
Then she got down and rode inside,
Independence and Grandmother Stark

2838
02:38:30,839 --> 02:38:32,286
shining in her eye.

2839
02:38:32,286 --> 02:38:36,489
At Point of Rocks, where they had supper
and his drive ended,

2840
02:38:36,489 --> 02:38:40,712
her face distracted his heart,
and he told her once more about his

2841
02:38:40,712 --> 02:38:43,679
cabin, and lamentably hoped
she would remember him.

2842
02:38:43,679 --> 02:38:48,230
She answered sweetly that she would try,
and gave him her hand.

2843
02:38:48,230 --> 02:38:53,749
After all, he was a frank-looking boy,
who had paid her the highest compliment

2844
02:38:53,749 --> 02:39:00,279
that a boy (or a man for that matter)
knows; and it is said that Molly Stark,

2845
02:39:00,279 --> 02:39:03,320
in her day, was not a New Woman.

2846
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:08,060
The new driver banished the first one
from the maiden’s mind.

2847
02:39:08,060 --> 02:39:11,672
He was not a frank-looking boy,
and he had been taking whiskey.

2848
02:39:11,672 --> 02:39:14,575
All night long he took it,
while his passenger,

2849
02:39:14,575 --> 02:39:19,080
helpless and sleepless inside the
lurching stage, sat as upright as

2850
02:39:19,080 --> 02:39:20,480
she possibly could; nor

2851
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:23,389
did the voices that she heard
at Drybone reassure her.

2852
02:39:23,389 --> 02:39:27,820
Sunrise found the white stage lurching
eternally on across the alkali,

2853
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:32,824
with a driver and a bottle on the box,
and a pale girl staring out at the

2854
02:39:32,824 --> 02:39:38,698
plain, and knotting in her handkerchief
some utterly dead flowers.

2855
02:39:38,698 --> 02:39:41,924
They came to a river where the man
bungled over the ford.

2856
02:39:41,924 --> 02:39:45,599
Two wheels sank down over an edge,
and the canvas toppled

2857
02:39:45,599 --> 02:39:47,149
like a descending kite.

2858
02:39:47,149 --> 02:39:52,965
The ripple came sucking through the upper
spokes, and as she felt the seat careen,

2859
02:39:52,965 --> 02:39:57,578
she put out her head and tremulously
asked if anything was wrong.

2860
02:39:57,578 --> 02:40:01,437
But the driver was addressing his team
with much language, and

2861
02:40:01,437 --> 02:40:03,567
also with the lash.

2862
02:40:03,567 --> 02:40:08,918
Then a tall rider appeared close against
the buried axles, and took her out of

2863
02:40:08,918 --> 02:40:13,850
the stage on his horse so
suddenly that she screamed.

2864
02:40:13,850 --> 02:40:19,048
She felt splashes, saw a swimming flood,
and found herself lifted

2865
02:40:19,048 --> 02:40:20,534
down upon the shore.

2866
02:40:20,534 --> 02:40:24,300
The rider said something to her about
cheering up, and its being all right,

2867
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:28,041
but her wits were stock-still,
so she did not speak and thank him.

2868
02:40:28,041 --> 02:40:32,719
After four days of train and thirty hours
of stage, she was having a little too

2869
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:34,679
much of the unknown at once.

2870
02:40:34,679 --> 02:40:40,571
Then the tall man gently withdrew leaving
her to become herself again.

2871
02:40:40,571 --> 02:40:44,782
She limply regarded the river pouring
round the slanted stage,

2872
02:40:44,782 --> 02:40:49,491
and a number of horsemen with ropes,
who righted the vehicle,

2873
02:40:49,491 --> 02:40:53,380
and got it quickly to dry land,
and disappeared at once with a herd of

2874
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:55,681
cattle, uttering lusty yells.

2875
02:40:55,681 --> 02:41:00,268
She saw the tall one delaying beside
the driver, and speaking.

2876
02:41:00,268 --> 02:41:03,881
He spoke so quietly that not a word
reached her, until of a sudden

2877
02:41:03,881 --> 02:41:06,192
the driver protested loudly.

2878
02:41:06,192 --> 02:41:09,929
The man had thrown something,
which turned out to be a bottle.

2879
02:41:09,929 --> 02:41:13,128
This twisted loftily and
dived into the stream.

2880
02:41:13,128 --> 02:41:17,642
He said something more to the driver,
then put his hand on the saddle-horn,

2881
02:41:17,642 --> 02:41:22,762
looked half-lingeringly at the passenger
on the bank, dropped his grave eyes from

2882
02:41:22,762 --> 02:41:29,386
hers, and swinging upon his horse,
was gone just as the passenger opened

2883
02:41:29,386 --> 02:41:35,179
her mouth and with inefficient voice
murmured, “Oh, thank you!”

2884
02:41:35,179 --> 02:41:36,700
at his departing back.

2885
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:39,858
The driver drove up now,
a chastened creature.

2886
02:41:39,858 --> 02:41:44,332
He helped Miss Wood in,
and inquired after her welfare with a

2887
02:41:44,332 --> 02:41:49,445
hanging head; then meek as his own
drenched horses, he climbed back to his

2888
02:41:49,445 --> 02:41:55,384
reins, and nursed the stage on toward
the Bow Leg Mountains much as if it

2889
02:41:55,384 --> 02:41:56,739
had been a perambulator.

2890
02:41:56,739 --> 02:42:00,464
As for Miss Wood, she sat recovering,
and she wondered what the man on the

2891
02:42:00,464 --> 02:42:02,342
horse must think of her.

2892
02:42:02,342 --> 02:42:06,917
She knew that she was not ungrateful,
and that if he had given her an

2893
02:42:06,917 --> 02:42:10,487
opportunity she would
have explained to him.

2894
02:42:10,487 --> 02:42:16,391
If he supposed that she did not
appreciate his act⁠—Here into the midst

2895
02:42:16,391 --> 02:42:21,214
of these meditations came an abrupt
memory that she had screamed⁠—she could

2896
02:42:21,214 --> 02:42:23,095
not be sure when.

2897
02:42:23,095 --> 02:42:26,375
She rehearsed the adventure from the
beginning, and found one or two further

2898
02:42:26,375 --> 02:42:30,897
uncertainties⁠—how it had all been while
she was on the horse, for instance.

2899
02:42:30,897 --> 02:42:36,853
It was confusing to determine precisely
what she had done with her arms.

2900
02:42:36,853 --> 02:42:39,182
She knew where one of his arms had been.

2901
02:42:39,182 --> 02:42:43,469
And the handkerchief with
the flowers was gone.

2902
02:42:43,469 --> 02:42:47,264
She made a few rapid dives
in search of it.

2903
02:42:47,264 --> 02:42:51,525
Had she, or had she not,
seen him putting something in his

2904
02:42:51,525 --> 02:42:52,065
pocket?

2905
02:42:52,065 --> 02:42:56,010
And why had she behaved so unlike herself?

2906
02:42:56,010 --> 02:43:01,529
In a few miles Miss Wood entertained
sentiments of maidenly resentment toward

2907
02:43:01,529 --> 02:43:04,459
her rescuer, and of maidenly hope
to see him again.

2908
02:43:04,459 --> 02:43:09,773
To that river crossing he came again,
alone, when the days were growing short.

2909
02:43:09,773 --> 02:43:14,624
The ford was dry sand,
and the stream a winding lane of

2910
02:43:14,624 --> 02:43:15,367
shingle.

2911
02:43:15,367 --> 02:43:20,786
He found a pool⁠—pools always survive the
year round in this stream⁠—and having

2912
02:43:20,786 --> 02:43:24,999
watered his pony, he lunched near the
spot to which he had borne the

2913
02:43:24,999 --> 02:43:26,926
frightened passenger that day.

2914
02:43:26,926 --> 02:43:30,969
Where the flowing current had been he
sat, regarding the now

2915
02:43:30,969 --> 02:43:32,849
extremely safe channel.

2916
02:43:32,849 --> 02:43:36,853
“She cert’nly wouldn’t need to grip me so
close this mawnin’,” he said,

2917
02:43:36,853 --> 02:43:38,681
as he pondered over his meal.

2918
02:43:38,681 --> 02:43:43,442
“I reckon it will mightily astonish her
when I tell her how harmless

2919
02:43:43,442 --> 02:43:44,882
the torrent is lookin’.”

2920
02:43:44,882 --> 02:43:49,103
He held out to his pony a slice of bread
matted with sardines,

2921
02:43:49,103 --> 02:43:51,380
which the pony expertly accepted.

2922
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:55,328
“You’re a plumb pie-biter
you Monte,” he continued.

2923
02:43:55,328 --> 02:43:59,189
Monte rubbed his nose
on his master’s shoulder.

2924
02:43:59,189 --> 02:44:02,034
“I wouldn’t trust you
with berries and cream.

2925
02:44:02,034 --> -1:59:59,000
No, seh; not though yu’ did
rescue a drownin’ lady.

2926
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

2927
02:44:07,564 --> 02:44:13,018
Presently he tightened the forward cinch,
got in the saddle, and the pony fell

2928
02:44:13,018 --> 02:44:16,740
into his wise mechanical jog;
for he had come a long way,

2929
02:44:16,740 --> 02:44:20,276
and was going a long way,
and he knew this as well as the man did.

2930
02:44:20,276 --> 02:44:26,071
To use the language of Cattle Land,
steers had “jumped to seventy-five.”

2931
02:44:26,071 --> 02:44:28,789
This was a great and prosperous
leap in their value.

2932
02:44:28,789 --> 02:44:33,440
To have flourished in that golden time
you need not be dead now,

2933
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:37,814
nor even middle-aged;
but it is Wyoming mythology already⁠—

2934
02:44:37,814 --> 02:44:40,222
quite as fabulous as the high-jumping
cow.

2935
02:44:40,222 --> 02:44:46,360
Indeed, people gathered together and
behaved themselves much in the same

2936
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:49,309
pleasant and improbable way.

2937
02:44:49,309 --> 02:44:55,783
Johnson County, and Natrona,
and Converse, and others,

2938
02:44:55,783 --> 02:44:59,983
to say nothing of the Cheyenne Club,
had been jumping over the moon for some

2939
02:44:59,983 --> 02:45:05,646
weeks, all on account of steers;
and on the strength of this vigorous

2940
02:45:05,646 --> 02:45:10,020
price of seventy-five,
the Stanton Brothers were giving a

2941
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:14,958
barbecue at the Goose Egg outfit,
their ranch on Bear Creek.

2942
02:45:14,958 --> 02:45:18,811
Of course the whole neighborhood was
bidden, and would come forty miles to a

2943
02:45:18,811 --> 02:45:21,711
man; some would come further⁠—the
Virginian was coming

2944
02:45:21,711 --> 02:45:22,831
a hundred and eighteen.

2945
02:45:22,831 --> 02:45:26,911
It had struck him⁠—rather suddenly,
as shall be made plain⁠—that he should

2946
02:45:26,911 --> 02:45:30,659
like to see how they were getting along
up there on Bear Creek.

2947
02:45:30,659 --> 02:45:33,966
“They,” was how he put
it to his acquaintances.

2948
02:45:33,966 --> 02:45:37,862
His acquaintances did not know that he
had bought himself a pair of trousers

2949
02:45:37,862 --> 02:45:41,820
and a scarf, unnecessarily excellent for
such a general visit.

2950
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:46,053
They did not know that in the spring,
two days after the adventure with the

2951
02:45:46,053 --> 02:45:51,394
stage, he had learned accidentally who
the lady in the stage was.

2952
02:45:51,394 --> 02:45:56,259
This he had kept to himself;
nor did the camp ever notice that he had

2953
02:45:56,259 --> 02:46:01,720
ceased to sing that eightieth stanza he
had made about the A.B.C.

2954
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:04,135
⁠—the stanza which was not printable.

2955
02:46:04,135 --> 02:46:09,578
He effaced it imperceptibly,
giving the boys the other seventy-

2956
02:46:09,578 --> 02:46:12,450
nine at judicious intervals.

2957
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:16,326
They dreamed of no guile,
but merely saw in him,

2958
02:46:16,326 --> 02:46:22,477
whether frequenting camp or town,
the same not over-angelic comrade whom

2959
02:46:22,477 --> 02:46:24,888
they valued and could
not wholly understand.

2960
02:46:24,888 --> 02:46:29,833
All spring he had ridden trail,
worked at ditches during summer,

2961
02:46:29,833 --> 02:46:32,398
and now he had just finished
with the beef roundup.

2962
02:46:32,398 --> 02:46:37,313
Yesterday, while he was spending a little
comfortable money at the Drybone hog-

2963
02:46:37,313 --> 02:46:42,096
ranch, a casual traveller from the north
gossiped of Bear Creek,

2964
02:46:42,096 --> 02:46:47,683
and the fences up there,
and the farm crops, the Westfalls,

2965
02:46:47,683 --> 02:46:53,258
and the young schoolmarm from Vermont,
for whom the Taylors had built a cabin

2966
02:46:53,258 --> 02:46:54,950
next door to theirs.

2967
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:58,489
The traveller had not seen her,
but Mrs. Taylor and all the ladies

2968
02:46:58,489 --> 02:47:02,877
thought the world of her,
and Lin McLean had told him she was

2969
02:47:02,877 --> 02:47:05,452
“away up in G.”

2970
02:47:05,452 --> 02:47:08,943
She would have plenty of partners
at this Swinton barbecue.

2971
02:47:08,943 --> 02:47:13,929
Great boon for the country,
wasn’t it, steers jumping that way?

2972
02:47:13,929 --> 02:47:19,675
The Virginian heard, asking no questions;
and left town in an hour,

2973
02:47:19,675 --> 02:47:24,051
with the scarf and trousers tied in his
slicker behind his saddle.

2974
02:47:24,051 --> 02:47:28,810
After looking upon the ford again,
even though it was dry and not at all

2975
02:47:28,810 --> 02:47:32,167
the same place, he journeyed
in attentively.

2976
02:47:32,167 --> 02:47:35,246
When you have been hard at work for
months with no time to think,

2977
02:47:35,246 --> 02:47:38,405
of course you think a great deal during
your first empty days.

2978
02:47:38,405 --> 02:47:41,524
“Step along, you Monte hawss!”

2979
02:47:41,524 --> 02:47:45,190
he said, rousing after some while.

2980
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:47,939
He disciplined Monte,
who flattened his ears

2981
02:47:47,939 --> 02:47:50,444
affectedly and snorted.

2982
02:47:50,444 --> 02:47:54,582
“Why, you surely ain’ thinkin’ of you’-
self as a hero?

2983
02:47:54,582 --> 02:47:57,265
She wasn’t really a-drowndin’,
you pie-biter.”

2984
02:47:57,265 --> 02:48:00,071
He rested his serious
glance upon the alkali.

2985
02:48:00,071 --> 02:48:05,560
“She’s not likely to have forgot
that mix-up, though.

2986
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:11,469
I guess I’ll not remind her about
grippin’ me, and all that.

2987
02:48:11,469 --> 02:48:15,019
She wasn’t the kind a man ought to
josh about such things.

2988
02:48:15,019 --> 02:48:17,208
She had a right clear eye.”

2989
02:48:17,208 --> 02:48:22,854
Thus, tall and loose in the saddle,
did he jog along the sixty miles which

2990
02:48:22,854 --> 02:48:25,845
still lay between him and the dance.

2991
02:48:25,845 --> 02:48:26,570
CHAPTER X

2992
02:48:26,570 --> 02:48:27,805
Where Fancy Was Bred

2993
02:48:27,805 --> 02:48:31,898
Two camps in the open,
and the Virginian’s Monte horse,

2994
02:48:31,898 --> 02:48:36,072
untired, brought him to the Swintons’ in
good time for the barbecue.

2995
02:48:36,072 --> 02:48:39,513
The horse received good food at length,
while his rider was welcomed

2996
02:48:39,513 --> 02:48:40,672
with good whiskey.

2997
02:48:40,672 --> 02:48:44,719
Good whiskey⁠—for had not steers
jumped to seventy-five?

2998
02:48:44,719 --> 02:48:49,397
Inside the Goose Egg kitchen many small
delicacies were preparing,

2999
02:48:49,397 --> 02:48:52,283
and a steer was roasting whole outside.

3000
02:48:52,283 --> 02:48:56,965
The bed of flame under it showed steadily
brighter against the dusk that was

3001
02:48:56,965 --> 02:48:59,058
beginning to veil the lowlands.

3002
02:48:59,058 --> 02:49:05,244
The busy hosts went and came,
while men stood and men lay

3003
02:49:05,244 --> 02:49:06,635
near the fire-glow.

3004
02:49:06,635 --> 02:49:11,381
Chalkeye was there, and Nebrasky,
and Trampas, and Honey Wiggin,

3005
02:49:11,381 --> 02:49:16,065
with others, enjoying the occasion;
but Honey Wiggin was enjoying himself:

3006
02:49:16,065 --> 02:49:19,518
he had an audience; he was sitting
up discoursing to it.

3007
02:49:19,518 --> 02:49:20,120
“Hello!”

3008
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:22,235
he said, perceiving the Virginian.

3009
02:49:22,235 --> 02:49:25,127
“So you’ve dropped in for your turn!

3010
02:49:25,127 --> 02:49:28,871
Number⁠—six, ain’t he, boys?”

3011
02:49:28,871 --> 02:49:33,516
“Depends who’s a-runnin’ the countin’,”
said the Virginian, and stretched

3012
02:49:33,516 --> 02:49:35,697
himself down among the audience.

3013
02:49:35,697 --> 02:49:41,132
“I’ve saw him number one when nobody else
was around,” said Trampas.

3014
02:49:41,132 --> 02:49:44,356
“How far away was you standin’
when you beheld that?”

3015
02:49:44,356 --> 02:49:46,111
inquired the lounging Southerner.

3016
02:49:46,111 --> 02:49:51,156
“Well, boys,” said Wiggin,
“I expect it will be Miss Schoolmarm

3017
02:49:51,156 --> 02:49:53,686
says who’s number one tonight.”

3018
02:49:53,686 --> 02:49:56,342
“So she’s arrived in this hyeh country?”

3019
02:49:56,342 --> 02:49:58,526
observed the Virginian, very casually.

3020
02:49:58,526 --> 02:49:59,683
“Arrived!”

3021
02:49:59,683 --> 02:50:01,292
said Trampas again.

3022
02:50:01,292 --> 02:50:03,002
“Where have you been grazing lately?”

3023
02:50:03,002 --> 02:50:06,043
“A right smart way from the mules.”

3024
02:50:06,043 --> 02:50:10,785
“Nebrasky and the boys was tellin’ me
they’d missed yu’ off the

3025
02:50:10,785 --> 02:50:14,152
range,” again interposed Wiggin.

3026
02:50:14,152 --> 02:50:19,392
“Say, Nebrasky, who have yu’ offered your
canary to the schoolmarm said

3027
02:50:19,392 --> 02:50:20,512
you mustn’t give her?”

3028
02:50:20,512 --> 02:50:22,595
Nebrasky grinned wretchedly.

3029
02:50:22,595 --> 02:50:27,986
“Well, she’s a lady, and she’s square,
not takin’ a man’s gift when she

3030
02:50:27,986 --> 02:50:29,368
don’t take the man.

3031
02:50:29,368 --> 02:50:32,663
But you’d ought to get back all them
letters yu’ wrote her.

3032
02:50:32,663 --> -1:59:59,000
Yu’ sure ought to ask
her for them telltales.

3033
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3034
02:50:36,243 --> 02:50:39,013
“Ah, pshaw, Honey!”

3035
02:50:39,013 --> 02:50:40,432
protested the youth.

3036
02:50:40,432 --> 02:50:43,819
It was well known that he could
not write his name.

3037
02:50:43,819 --> 02:50:46,182
“Why, if here ain’t Bokay Baldy!”

3038
02:50:46,182 --> 02:50:49,943
cried the agile Wiggin,
stooping to fresh prey.

3039
02:50:49,943 --> 02:50:52,408
“Found them slippers yet, Baldy?

3040
02:50:52,408 --> 02:50:56,862
Tell yu’ boys, that was turruble
sad luck Baldy had.

3041
02:50:56,862 --> 02:50:58,010
Did yu’ hear about that?

3042
02:50:58,010 --> 02:51:03,974
Baldy, yu’ know, he can stay on a tame
horse most as well as the schoolmarm.

3043
02:51:03,974 --> 02:51:07,779
But just you give him a pair of young
knittin’-needles and see

3044
02:51:07,779 --> 02:51:09,039
him make ’em sweat!

3045
02:51:09,039 --> 02:51:13,702
He worked an elegant pair of slippers
with pink cabbages on ’em for Miss

3046
02:51:13,702 --> 02:51:14,319
Wood.”

3047
02:51:14,319 --> 02:51:17,426
“I bought ’em at Medicine
Bow,” blundered Baldy.

3048
02:51:17,426 --> 02:51:18,618
“So yu’ did!”

3049
02:51:18,618 --> 02:51:21,044
assented the skilful comedian.

3050
02:51:21,044 --> 02:51:23,691
“Baldy he bought ’em.

3051
02:51:23,691 --> 02:51:29,507
And on the road to her cabin there at the
Taylors’ he got thinkin’ they might be

3052
02:51:29,507 --> 02:51:33,033
too big, and he got studyin’ what to do.

3053
02:51:33,033 --> 02:51:36,421
And he fixed up to tell her about his not
bein’ sure of the size,

3054
02:51:36,421 --> 02:51:41,189
and how she was to let him know if they
dropped off her, and he’d exchange ’em,

3055
02:51:41,189 --> 02:51:45,238
and when he got right near her door,
why, he couldn’t find his courage.

3056
02:51:45,238 --> 02:51:50,137
And so he slips the parcel under the
fence and starts serenadin’ her.

3057
02:51:50,137 --> 02:51:54,338
But she ain’t inside her cabin at all.

3058
02:51:54,338 --> 02:51:59,135
She’s at supper next door with the
Taylors, and Baldy singin’ ‘Love has

3059
02:51:59,135 --> 02:52:02,706
conqwered pride and angwer’
to a lone house.

3060
02:52:02,706 --> 02:52:07,829
Lin McLean was comin’ up by Taylor’s
corral, where Taylor’s Texas bull was.

3061
02:52:07,829 --> 02:52:10,872
Well, it was turruble sad.

3062
02:52:10,872 --> 02:52:15,493
Baldy’s pants got tore,
but he fell inside the fence,

3063
02:52:15,493 --> 02:52:20,181
and Lin druv the bull back and somebody
stole them Medicine Bow galoshes.

3064
02:52:20,181 --> -1:59:59,000
Are you goin’ to knit
her some more, Bokay?

3065
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3066
02:52:22,343 --> 02:52:27,311
“About half that ain’t straight,”
Baldy commented, with mildness.

3067
02:52:27,311 --> 02:52:31,081
“The half that was tore off yer pants?

3068
02:52:31,081 --> 02:52:34,580
Well, never mind, Baldy;
Lin will get left too,

3069
02:52:34,580 --> 02:52:36,167
same as all of yu’.”

3070
02:52:36,167 --> 02:52:37,704
“Is there many?”

3071
02:52:37,704 --> 02:52:38,981
inquired the Virginian.

3072
02:52:38,981 --> 02:52:42,712
He was still stretched on his back,
looking up at the sky.

3073
02:52:42,712 --> 02:52:47,039
“I don’t know how many she’s been used to
where she was raised,” Wiggin answered.

3074
02:52:47,039 --> 02:52:51,456
“A kid stage-driver come from Point of
Rocks one day and went back the next.

3075
02:52:51,456 --> 02:52:56,517
Then the foreman of the 76 outfit,
and the horse-wrangler from the Bar-

3076
02:52:56,517 --> 02:53:02,025
Circle-L, and two deputy marshals,
with punchers, stringin’ right along⁠—

3077
02:53:02,025 --> 02:53:03,702
all got their tumble.

3078
02:53:03,702 --> 02:53:09,134
Old Judge Burrage from Cheyenne come up
in August for a hunt and stayed round

3079
02:53:09,134 --> 02:53:11,003
here and never hunted at all.

3080
02:53:11,003 --> 02:53:13,662
There was that horse thief⁠—
awful good-lookin’.

3081
02:53:13,662 --> 02:53:17,655
Taylor wanted to warn her about him,
but Mrs. Taylor said she’d look after

3082
02:53:17,655 --> 02:53:18,934
her if it was needed.

3083
02:53:18,934 --> 02:53:19,454
Mr.

3084
02:53:19,454 --> 02:53:24,767
Horse-thief gave it up quicker than most;
but the schoolmarm couldn’t have knowed

3085
02:53:24,767 --> 02:53:29,080
he had a Mrs. Horse-thief camped on
Poison Spider till afterwards.

3086
02:53:29,080 --> 02:53:30,782
She wouldn’t go ridin’ with him.

3087
02:53:30,782 --> -1:59:59,000
She’ll go with some, takin’ a kid along.

3088
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3089
02:53:33,712 --> 02:53:34,473
“Bah!”

3090
02:53:34,473 --> 02:53:36,521
said Trampas.

3091
02:53:36,521 --> 02:53:41,064
The Virginian stopped looking at the sky,
and watched Trampas from where he lay.

3092
02:53:41,064 --> 02:53:45,534
“I think she encourages a man
some,” said poor Nebrasky.

3093
02:53:45,534 --> 02:53:46,976
“Encourages?

3094
02:53:46,976 --> 02:53:50,796
Because she lets yu’ teach her how
to shoot,” said Wiggin.

3095
02:53:50,796 --> 02:53:53,211
“Well⁠—I don’t guess I’m a judge.

3096
02:53:53,211 --> 02:53:56,931
I’ve always kind o’ kep’ away
from them good women.

3097
02:53:56,931 --> 02:54:00,410
Don’t seem to think of anything to
chat about to ’em.

3098
02:54:00,410 --> 02:54:03,896
The only folks I’d say she encourages
is the school kids.

3099
02:54:03,896 --> 02:54:05,248
She kisses them.”

3100
02:54:05,248 --> 02:54:09,230
“Riding and shooting and kissing
the kids,” sneered Trampas.

3101
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:11,810
“That’s a heap too pussy-kitten for me.”

3102
02:54:11,810 --> 02:54:12,759
They laughed.

3103
02:54:12,759 --> 02:54:16,030
The sagebrush audience is readily cynical.

3104
02:54:16,030 --> 02:54:18,865
“Look for the man, I say,”
Trampas pursued.

3105
02:54:18,865 --> 02:54:20,258
“And ain’t he there?

3106
02:54:20,258 --> 02:54:25,223
She leaves Baldy sit on the fence while
she and Lin McLean⁠—”

3107
02:54:25,223 --> 02:54:28,689
They laughed loudly at the blackguard
picture which he drew;

3108
02:54:28,689 --> 02:54:33,421
and the laugh stopped short,
for the Virginian stood over Trampas.

3109
02:54:33,421 --> 02:54:37,446
“You can rise up now,
and tell them you lie,” he said.

3110
02:54:37,446 --> 02:54:40,977
The man was still for a moment
in the dead silence.

3111
02:54:40,977 --> 02:54:45,012
“I thought you claimed you and her wasn’t
acquainted,” said he then.

3112
02:54:45,012 --> 02:54:48,867
“Stand on your laigs,
you polecat, and say you’re a liar!”

3113
02:54:48,867 --> 02:54:50,811
Trampas’s hand moved behind him.

3114
02:54:50,811 --> 02:54:55,143
“Quit that,” said the Southerner,
“or I’ll break your neck!”

3115
02:54:55,143 --> 02:54:58,337
The eye of a man is the
prince of deadly weapons.

3116
02:54:58,337 --> 02:55:02,729
Trampas looked in the
Virginian’s, and slowly rose.

3117
02:55:02,729 --> 02:55:07,678
“I didn’t mean⁠—” he began,
and paused, his face poisonously

3118
02:55:07,678 --> 02:55:08,409
bloated.

3119
02:55:08,409 --> 02:55:10,679
“Well, I’ll call that sufficient.

3120
02:55:10,679 --> 02:55:12,545
Keep a-standin’ still.

3121
02:55:12,545 --> 02:55:14,582
I ain’ going to trouble yu’ long.

3122
02:55:14,582 --> 02:55:20,551
In admittin’ yourself to be a liar you
have spoke God’s truth for onced.

3123
02:55:20,551 --> 02:55:26,274
Honey Wiggin, you and me and the boys
have hit town too frequent for any of us

3124
02:55:26,274 --> 02:55:29,418
to play Sunday on the
balance of the gang.”

3125
02:55:29,418 --> 02:55:33,957
He stopped and surveyed Public Opinion,
seated around in carefully

3126
02:55:33,957 --> 02:55:35,397
inexpressive attention.

3127
02:55:35,397 --> 02:55:39,357
“We ain’t a Christian outfit a little
bit, and maybe we have most forgotten

3128
02:55:39,357 --> 02:55:40,866
what decency feels like.

3129
02:55:40,866 --> 02:55:43,326
But I reckon we haven’t
forgot what it means.

3130
02:55:43,326 --> -1:59:59,000
You can sit down now, if you want.

3131
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3132
02:55:45,541 --> 02:55:49,240
The liar stood and sneered
experimentally, looking

3133
02:55:49,240 --> 02:55:50,921
at Public Opinion.

3134
02:55:50,921 --> 02:55:55,771
But this changeful deity was no longer
with him, and he heard it variously

3135
02:55:55,771 --> 02:56:00,051
assenting, “That’s so,”
and “She’s a lady,” and

3136
02:56:00,051 --> 02:56:04,055
otherwise excellently moralizing.

3137
02:56:04,055 --> 02:56:05,755
So he held his peace.

3138
02:56:05,755 --> 02:56:09,419
When, however, the Virginian had departed
to the roasting steer,

3139
02:56:09,419 --> 02:56:14,160
and Public Opinion relaxed into that
comfort which we all experience when the

3140
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:18,363
sermon ends, Trampas sat down amid the
reviving cheerfulness,

3141
02:56:18,363 --> 02:56:20,636
and ventured again to be facetious.

3142
02:56:20,636 --> 02:56:24,374
“Shut your rank mouth,”
said Wiggin to him, amiably.

3143
02:56:24,374 --> 02:56:29,844
“I don’t care whether he knows her or if
he done it on principle.

3144
02:56:29,844 --> 02:56:32,662
I’ll accept the roundin’ up he
gave us⁠—and say!

3145
02:56:32,662 --> 02:56:34,539
You’ll swallo’ your dose, too!

3146
02:56:34,539 --> -1:59:59,000
Us boys’ll stand in with him in this.

3147
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3148
02:56:38,182 --> 02:56:41,665
So Trampas swallowed.

3149
02:56:41,665 --> 02:56:43,987
And what of the Virginian?

3150
02:56:43,987 --> 02:56:47,955
He had championed the feeble,
and spoken honorably in meeting,

3151
02:56:47,955 --> 02:56:51,566
and according to all the constitutions
and bylaws of morality,

3152
02:56:51,566 --> 02:56:54,699
he should have been walking
in virtue’s especial calm.

3153
02:56:54,699 --> 02:56:57,162
But there it was!

3154
02:56:57,162 --> 02:57:04,823
he had spoken; he had given them a peep
through the keyhole at his inner man;

3155
02:57:04,823 --> 02:57:07,884
and as he prowled away from the
assemblage before whom he stood

3156
02:57:07,884 --> 02:57:10,877
convicted of decency,
it was vicious rather than

3157
02:57:10,877 --> 02:57:12,191
virtuous that he felt.

3158
02:57:12,191 --> 02:57:16,889
Other matters also disquieted him⁠—so Lin
McLean was hanging round that

3159
02:57:16,889 --> 02:57:17,837
schoolmarm!

3160
02:57:17,837 --> 02:57:22,374
Yet he joined Ben Swinton in
a seemingly Christian spirit.

3161
02:57:22,374 --> 02:57:26,974
He took some whiskey and praised the size
of the barrel, speaking with

3162
02:57:26,974 --> 02:57:28,311
his host like this:⁠—

3163
02:57:28,311 --> 02:57:32,023
“There cert’nly ain’ goin’ to be trouble
about a second helpin’.”

3164
02:57:32,023 --> 02:57:33,075
“Hope not.

3165
02:57:33,075 --> 02:57:35,555
We’d ought to have more trimmings, though.

3166
02:57:35,555 --> 02:57:37,316
We’re shy on ducks.”

3167
02:57:37,316 --> 02:57:38,796
“Yu’ have the barrel.

3168
02:57:38,796 --> 02:57:41,196
Has Lin McLean seen that?”

3169
02:57:41,196 --> 02:57:42,476
“No.

3170
02:57:42,476 --> 02:57:47,167
We tried for ducks away down as far
as the Laparel outfit.

3171
02:57:47,167 --> 02:57:48,481
A real barbecue⁠—”

3172
02:57:48,481 --> 02:57:51,207
“There’s large thirsts on Bear Creek.

3173
02:57:51,207 --> 02:57:53,461
Lin McLean will pass on ducks.”

3174
02:57:53,461 --> 02:57:56,989
“Lin’s not thirsty this month.”

3175
02:57:56,989 --> -1:59:59,000
“Signed for one month, has he?

3176
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3177
02:58:00,269 --> 02:58:01,267
“Signed!

3178
02:58:01,267 --> 02:58:03,149
He’s spooning our schoolmarm!”

3179
02:58:03,149 --> 02:58:05,637
“They claim she’s a right
sweet-faced girl.”

3180
02:58:05,637 --> 02:58:07,892
“Yes; yes; awful agreeable.

3181
02:58:07,892 --> 02:58:09,927
And next thing you’re
fooled clean through.”

3182
02:58:09,927 --> 02:58:10,739
“Yu’ don’t say!”

3183
02:58:10,739 --> 02:58:14,584
“She keeps a-teaching the darned kids,
and it seems like a good growed-up

3184
02:58:14,584 --> 02:58:17,525
man can’t interest her.”

3185
02:58:17,525 --> 02:58:20,045
“Yu’ don’t say!”

3186
02:58:20,045 --> 02:58:22,685
“There used to be all the ducks you
wanted at the Laparel,

3187
02:58:22,685 --> 02:58:25,985
but their fool cook’s dead stuck on
raising turkeys this year.”

3188
02:58:25,985 --> 02:58:28,605
“That must have been mighty close to a
drowndin’ the schoolmarm

3189
02:58:28,605 --> 02:58:29,685
got at South Fork.”

3190
02:58:29,685 --> 02:58:31,011
“Why, I guess not.

3191
02:58:31,011 --> 02:58:32,514
When?

3192
02:58:32,514 --> 02:58:35,983
She’s never spoken of any such
thing⁠—that I’ve heard.”

3193
02:58:35,983 --> 02:58:39,082
“Mos’ likely the stage-driver
got it wrong, then.”

3194
02:58:39,082 --> 02:58:39,666
“Yes.

3195
02:58:39,666 --> 02:58:41,136
Must have drownded somebody else.

3196
02:58:41,136 --> 02:58:42,233
Here they come!

3197
02:58:42,233 --> 02:58:44,166
That’s her ridin’ the horse.

3198
02:58:44,166 --> 02:58:45,768
There’s the Westfalls.

3199
02:58:45,768 --> 02:58:47,098
Where are you running to?”

3200
02:58:47,098 --> 02:58:47,959
“To fix up.

3201
02:58:47,959 --> 02:58:49,609
Got any soap around hyeh?”

3202
02:58:49,609 --> 02:58:53,609
“Yes,” shouted Swinton,
for the Virginian was now some distance

3203
02:58:53,609 --> 02:58:57,325
away; “towels and everything
in the dugout.”

3204
02:58:57,325 --> 02:59:00,004
And he went to welcome
his first formal guests.

3205
02:59:00,004 --> 02:59:02,581
The Virginian reached his
saddle under a shed.

3206
02:59:02,581 --> 02:59:06,844
“So she’s never mentioned it,”
said he, untying his slicker for

3207
02:59:06,844 --> 02:59:08,506
the trousers and scarf.

3208
02:59:08,506 --> 02:59:10,911
“I didn’t notice Lin anywheres
around her.”

3209
02:59:10,911 --> 02:59:14,892
He was over in the dugout now,
whipping off his overalls;

3210
02:59:14,892 --> 02:59:20,269
and soon he was excellently clean and
ready, except for the tie in his scarf

3211
02:59:20,269 --> 02:59:21,679
and the part in his hair.

3212
02:59:21,679 --> 02:59:24,326
“I’d have knowed her in
Greenland,” he remarked.

3213
02:59:24,326 --> 02:59:28,756
He held the candle up and down at the
looking-glass, and the looking-glass up

3214
02:59:28,756 --> 02:59:29,945
and down at his head.

3215
02:59:29,945 --> 02:59:32,337
“It’s mighty strange why
she ain’t mentioned that.”

3216
02:59:32,337 --> 02:59:35,236
He worried the scarf a fold or two
further, and at length,

3217
02:59:35,236 --> 02:59:39,849
a trifle more than satisfied with his
appearance, he proceeded most serenely

3218
02:59:39,849 --> 02:59:41,805
toward the sound of the tuning fiddles.

3219
02:59:41,805 --> 02:59:46,110
He passed through the storeroom behind
the kitchen, stepping lightly lest he

3220
02:59:46,110 --> 02:59:51,256
should rouse the ten or twelve babies
that lay on the table or beneath it.

3221
02:59:51,256 --> 02:59:55,825
On Bear Creek babies and children always
went with their parents to a dance,

3222
02:59:55,825 --> 02:59:57,472
because nurses were unknown.

3223
02:59:57,472 --> 03:00:02,138
So little Alfred and Christopher lay
there among the wraps,

3224
03:00:02,138 --> 03:00:08,173
parallel and crosswise with little
Taylors, and little Carmodys,

3225
03:00:08,173 --> 03:00:14,096
and Lees, and all the Bear Creek
offspring that was not yet able to skip

3226
03:00:14,096 --> 03:00:22,052
at large and hamper its indulgent
elders in the ballroom.

3227
03:00:22,052 --> 03:00:25,012
“Why, Lin ain’t hyeh yet!”

3228
03:00:25,012 --> 03:00:28,434
said the Virginian, looking
in upon the people.

3229
03:00:28,434 --> 03:00:31,559
There was Miss Wood, standing
up for the quadrille.

3230
03:00:31,559 --> 03:00:34,741
“I didn’t remember her hair was
that pretty,” said he.

3231
03:00:34,741 --> 03:00:36,461
“But ain’t she a little, little girl!”

3232
03:00:36,461 --> 03:00:39,705
Now she was in truth five feet three;
but then he could look away down on the

3233
03:00:39,705 --> 03:00:40,477
top of her head.

3234
03:00:40,477 --> 03:00:42,092
“Salute your honey!”

3235
03:00:42,092 --> 03:00:44,009
called the first fiddler.

3236
03:00:44,009 --> 03:00:48,578
All partners bowed to each other,
and as she turned, Miss Wood saw the

3237
03:00:48,578 --> 03:00:50,673
man in the doorway.

3238
03:00:50,673 --> 03:00:56,301
Again, as it had been at South Fork that
day, his eyes dropped from hers,

3239
03:00:56,301 --> 03:01:00,301
and she divining instantly why he had
come after half a year,

3240
03:01:00,301 --> 03:01:04,385
thought of the handkerchief and of that
scream of hers in the river,

3241
03:01:04,385 --> 03:01:09,013
and became filled with tyranny and
anticipation; for indeed he was

3242
03:01:09,013 --> 03:01:10,293
fine to look upon.

3243
03:01:10,293 --> 03:01:14,242
So she danced away, carefully
unaware of his existence.

3244
03:01:14,242 --> 03:01:16,125
“First lady, centre!”

3245
03:01:16,125 --> 03:01:19,035
said her partner, reminding
her of her turn.

3246
03:01:19,035 --> 03:01:21,594
“Have you forgotten how it
goes since last time?”

3247
03:01:21,594 --> 03:01:24,968
Molly Wood did not forget again,
but quadrilled with the

3248
03:01:24,968 --> 03:01:27,759
most sprightly devotion.

3249
03:01:27,759 --> 03:01:33,632
“I see some new faces
tonight,” said she, presently.

3250
03:01:33,632 --> 03:01:37,832
“Yu’ always do forget our poor
faces,” said her partner.

3251
03:01:37,832 --> 03:01:39,214
“Oh, no!

3252
03:01:39,214 --> 03:01:41,417
There’s a stranger now.

3253
03:01:41,417 --> -1:59:59,000
Who is that black man?

3254
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3255
03:01:43,693 --> 03:01:48,267
“Well⁠—he’s from Virginia,
and he ain’t allowin’ he’s black.”

3256
03:01:48,267 --> 03:01:50,035
“He’s a tenderfoot, I suppose?”

3257
03:01:50,035 --> 03:01:50,873
“Ha, ha, ha!

3258
03:01:50,873 --> 03:01:52,037
That’s rich, too!”

3259
03:01:52,037 --> 03:01:54,635
and so the simple partner explained a
great deal about the

3260
03:01:54,635 --> 03:01:56,177
Virginian to Molly Wood.

3261
03:01:56,177 --> 03:02:00,318
At the end of the set she saw the man by
the door take a step in her direction.

3262
03:02:00,318 --> 03:02:04,881
“Oh,” said she, quickly,
to the partner, “how warm it is!

3263
03:02:04,881 --> 03:02:07,389
I must see how those babies are doing.”

3264
03:02:07,389 --> 03:02:10,399
And she passed the Virginian in
a breeze of unconcern.

3265
03:02:10,399 --> 03:02:13,548
His eyes gravely lingered
where she had gone.

3266
03:02:13,548 --> 03:02:16,348
“She knowed me right away,” said he.

3267
03:02:16,348 --> 03:02:19,500
He looked for a moment,
then leaned against the door.

3268
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:20,945
“ ’How warm it is!’

3269
03:02:20,945 --> 03:02:21,823
said she.

3270
03:02:21,823 --> 03:02:25,943
Well, it ain’t so screechin’ hot hyeh;
and as for rushin’ after Alfred and

3271
03:02:25,943 --> 03:02:29,903
Christopher, when their natural motheh
is bumpin’ around handy⁠—she

3272
03:02:29,903 --> 03:02:31,497
cert’nly can’t be offended?”

3273
03:02:31,497 --> 03:02:34,215
he broke off, and looked again
where she had gone.

3274
03:02:34,215 --> 03:02:38,446
And then Miss Wood passed him brightly
again, and was dancing

3275
03:02:38,446 --> 03:02:40,988
the schottische almost immediately.

3276
03:02:40,988 --> 03:02:45,750
“Oh, yes, she knows me,”
the swarthy cowpuncher mused.

3277
03:02:45,750 --> 03:02:48,879
“She has to take trouble not to see me.

3278
03:02:48,879 --> 03:02:52,428
And what she’s a-fussin’
at is mighty interestin’.

3279
03:02:52,428 --> 03:02:53,136
Hello!”

3280
03:02:53,136 --> 03:02:54,468
“Hello!”

3281
03:02:54,468 --> 03:02:56,453
returned Lin McLean, sourly.

3282
03:02:56,453 --> 03:02:58,506
He had just looked into the kitchen.

3283
03:02:58,506 --> 03:02:59,867
“Not dancin’?”

3284
03:02:59,867 --> 03:03:01,546
the Southerner inquired.

3285
03:03:01,546 --> 03:03:02,964
“Don’t know how.”

3286
03:03:02,964 --> 03:03:05,656
“Had scyarlet fever and
forgot your past life?”

3287
03:03:05,656 --> 03:03:06,590
Lin grinned.

3288
03:03:06,590 --> 03:03:10,187
“Better persuade the schoolmarm
to learn it.

3289
03:03:10,187 --> -1:59:59,000
She’s goin’ to give me instruction

3290
-1:59:59,000 --> -1:59:59,000
.

3291
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3292
03:03:11,865 --> 03:03:12,656
“Huh!”

3293
03:03:12,656 --> 03:03:15,822
went Mr. McLean, and skulked
out to the barrel.

3294
03:03:15,822 --> 03:03:20,016
“Why, they claimed you
weren’t drinkin’ this month!”

3295
03:03:20,016 --> 03:03:21,646
said his friend, following.

3296
03:03:21,646 --> 03:03:23,057
“Well, I am.

3297
03:03:23,057 --> 03:03:23,798
Here’s luck!”

3298
03:03:23,798 --> 03:03:25,885
The two pledged in tin cups.

3299
03:03:25,885 --> 03:03:30,027
“But I’m not waltzin’ with her,”
blurted Mr. McLean grievously.

3300
03:03:30,027 --> 03:03:32,541
“She called me an exception.”

3301
03:03:32,541 --> 03:03:36,454
“Waltzin’,” repeated the Virginian
quickly, and hearing the

3302
03:03:36,454 --> 03:03:38,229
fiddles he hastened away.

3303
03:03:38,229 --> 03:03:42,644
Few in the Bear Creek Country could
waltz, and with these few it was mostly

3304
03:03:42,644 --> 03:03:48,177
an unsteered and ponderous exhibition;
therefore was the Southerner bent upon

3305
03:03:48,177 --> 03:03:49,805
profiting by his skill.

3306
03:03:49,805 --> 03:03:54,443
He entered the room, and his lady saw him
come where she sat alone for the moment,

3307
03:03:54,443 --> 03:03:56,379
and her thoughts grew a little hurried.

3308
03:03:56,379 --> 03:03:58,085
“Will you try a turn, ma’am?”

3309
03:03:58,085 --> 03:03:59,329
“I beg your pardon?”

3310
03:03:59,329 --> 03:04:04,394
It was a remote, well-schooled eye that
she lifted now upon him.

3311
03:04:04,394 --> 03:04:07,229
“If you like a waltz,
ma’am, will you waltz with me?”

3312
03:04:07,229 --> 03:04:09,553
“You’re from Virginia, I understand?”

3313
03:04:09,553 --> 03:04:14,220
said Molly Wood, regarding him
politely, but not rising.

3314
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:18,841
One gains authority immensely
by keeping one’s seat.

3315
03:04:18,841 --> 03:04:22,342
All good teachers know this.

3316
03:04:22,342 --> 03:04:24,081
“Yes, ma’am, from Virginia.”

3317
03:04:24,081 --> 03:04:26,426
“I’ve heard that Southerners
have such good manners.”

3318
03:04:26,426 --> 03:04:27,462
“That’s correct.”

3319
03:04:27,462 --> 03:04:30,784
The cowpuncher flushed,
but he spoke in his unvaryingly

3320
03:04:30,784 --> 03:04:31,878
gentle voice.

3321
03:04:31,878 --> 03:04:35,663
“For in New England, you know,”
pursued Miss Molly, noting his scarf and

3322
03:04:35,663 --> 03:04:39,738
clean-shaven chin, and then again
steadily meeting his eye,

3323
03:04:39,738 --> 03:04:44,559
“gentlemen ask to be presented to ladies
before they ask them to waltz.”

3324
03:04:44,559 --> 03:04:49,317
He stood a moment before her,
deeper and deeper scarlet;

3325
03:04:49,317 --> 03:04:54,457
and the more she saw his handsome face,
the keener rose her excitement.

3326
03:04:54,457 --> 03:04:59,173
She waited for him to speak of the river;
for then she was going to be surprised,

3327
03:04:59,173 --> 03:05:03,827
and gradually to remember,
and finally to be very nice to him.

3328
03:05:03,827 --> 03:05:05,176
But he did not wait.

3329
03:05:05,176 --> 03:05:08,660
“I ask your pardon, lady,”
said he, and bowing,

3330
03:05:08,660 --> 03:05:12,930
walked off, leaving her at once afraid
that he might not come back.

3331
03:05:12,930 --> 03:05:16,631
But she had altogether mistaken her man.

3332
03:05:16,631 --> 03:05:21,443
Back he came serenely with Mr. Taylor,
and was duly presented to her.

3333
03:05:21,443 --> 03:05:25,180
Thus were the conventions vindicated.

3334
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:28,771
It can never be known what the cowpuncher
was going to say next;

3335
03:05:28,771 --> 03:05:32,402
for Uncle Hughey stepped up with a glass
of water which he had left Wood to

3336
03:05:32,402 --> 03:05:37,094
bring, and asking for a turn,
most graciously received it.

3337
03:05:37,094 --> 03:05:41,917
She danced away from a situation where
she began to feel herself getting

3338
03:05:41,917 --> 03:05:42,767
the worst of it.

3339
03:05:42,767 --> 03:05:48,281
One moment the Virginian stared at his
lady as she lightly circulated,

3340
03:05:48,281 --> 03:05:50,035
and then he went out to the barrel.

3341
03:05:50,035 --> 03:05:52,321
Leave him for Uncle Hershey!

3342
03:05:52,321 --> 03:05:57,442
Jealousy is a deep and delicate thing,
and works its spite in many ways.

3343
03:05:57,442 --> 03:06:02,287
The Virginian had been ready to look at
Lin McLean with a hostile eye;

3344
03:06:02,287 --> 03:06:07,098
but finding him now beside the barrel,
he felt a brotherhood between himself

3345
03:06:07,098 --> 03:06:11,096
and Lin, and his hostility had taken a
new and whimsical direction.

3346
03:06:11,096 --> 03:06:11,966
“Here’s how!”

3347
03:06:11,966 --> 03:06:13,458
said he to McLean.

3348
03:06:13,458 --> 03:06:16,529
And they pledged each other
in the tin cups.

3349
03:06:16,529 --> 03:06:19,703
“Been gettin’ them instructions?”

3350
03:06:19,703 --> 03:06:21,758
said Mr. McLean, grinning.

3351
03:06:21,758 --> 03:06:24,729
“I thought I saw yu’ learning your
steps through the window.”

3352
03:06:24,729 --> 03:06:27,304
“Here’s your good health,”
said the Southerner.

3353
03:06:27,304 --> 03:06:31,034
Once more they pledged
each other handsomely.

3354
03:06:31,034 --> 03:06:34,331
“Did she call you an exception,
or anything?”

3355
03:06:34,331 --> 03:06:34,927
said Lin.

3356
03:06:34,927 --> 03:06:38,492
“Well, it would cipher out right
close in that neighborhood.”

3357
03:06:38,492 --> 03:06:39,536
“Here’s how, then!”

3358
03:06:39,536 --> 03:06:42,253
cried the delighted Lin, over his cup.

3359
03:06:42,253 --> 03:06:47,013
“Jest because yu’ happen to come from
Vermont,” continued Mr. McLean,

3360
03:06:47,013 --> 03:06:49,129
“is no cause for extra pride.

3361
03:06:49,129 --> 03:06:49,841
Shoo!

3362
03:06:49,841 --> 03:06:53,425
I was raised in Massachusetts myself,
and big men have been raised there,

3363
03:06:53,425 --> 03:06:58,051
too⁠—Daniel Webster and Israel Putnam:
and a lot of them politicians.”

3364
03:06:58,051 --> 03:07:01,932
“Virginia is a good little old
state,” observed the Southerner.

3365
03:07:01,932 --> 03:07:04,342
“Both of ’em’s a sight ahead of Vermont.

3366
03:07:04,342 --> 03:07:07,549
She told me I was the
first exception she’d struck.”

3367
03:07:07,549 --> 03:07:10,589
“What rule were you provin’
at the time, Lin?”

3368
03:07:10,589 --> 03:07:13,772
“Well yu’ see, I started to kiss her.”

3369
03:07:13,772 --> 03:07:15,151
“Yu’ didn’t!”

3370
03:07:15,151 --> 03:07:16,199
“Shucks!

3371
03:07:16,199 --> 03:07:17,479
I didn’t mean nothin’.”

3372
03:07:17,479 --> 03:07:19,207
“I reckon yu’ stopped mighty sudden?”

3373
03:07:19,207 --> 03:07:23,387
“Why, I’d been ridin’ out with her⁠—
ridin’ to school, ridin’ from school,

3374
03:07:23,387 --> 03:07:26,702
and a-comin’ and a-goin’, and she
chattin’ cheerful and askin’ me a heap

3375
03:07:26,702 --> 03:07:30,868
o’ questions all about myself every day,
and I not lyin’ much neither.

3376
03:07:30,868 --> 03:07:33,062
And so I figured she wouldn’t mind.

3377
03:07:33,062 --> 03:07:34,503
Lots of ’em like it.

3378
03:07:34,503 --> -1:59:59,000
But she didn’t, you bet!

3379
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3380
03:07:36,877 --> 03:07:40,378
“No,” said the Virginian,
deeply proud of his lady

3381
03:07:40,378 --> 03:07:41,468
who had slighted him.

3382
03:07:41,468 --> 03:07:45,277
He had pulled her out of the water once,
and he had been her unrewarded knight

3383
03:07:45,277 --> 03:07:49,629
even today, and he felt his grievance;
but he spoke not of it to Lin;

3384
03:07:49,629 --> 03:07:55,218
for he felt also, in memory,
her arms clinging round him as he

3385
03:07:55,218 --> 03:07:57,417
carried her ashore upon his horse.

3386
03:07:57,417 --> 03:07:59,516
But he muttered, “Plumb ridiculous!”

3387
03:07:59,516 --> 03:08:04,877
as her injustice struck him afresh,
while the outraged McLean told his tale.

3388
03:08:04,877 --> 03:08:09,345
“Trample is what she has done on me
tonight, and without notice.

3389
03:08:09,345 --> 03:08:13,368
We was startin’ to come here;
Taylor and Mrs. were ahead in the buggy,

3390
03:08:13,368 --> 03:08:16,767
and I was holdin’ her horse,
and helpin’ her up in the saddle,

3391
03:08:16,767 --> 03:08:18,914
like I done for days and days.

3392
03:08:18,914 --> 03:08:20,034
Who was there to see us?

3393
03:08:20,034 --> 03:08:24,715
And I figured she’d not mind,
and she calls me an exception!

3394
03:08:24,715 --> 03:08:30,510
Yu’d ought to’ve just heard her about
Western men respectin’ women.

3395
03:08:30,510 --> 03:08:33,070
So that’s the last word we’ve spoke.

3396
03:08:33,070 --> 03:08:37,064
We come twenty-five miles then,
she scootin’ in front,

3397
03:08:37,064 --> 03:08:40,368
and her horse kickin’ the
sand in my face.

3398
03:08:40,368 --> 03:08:40,808
Mrs.

3399
03:08:40,808 --> 03:08:44,139
Taylor, she guessed something was up,
but she didn’t tell.”

3400
03:08:44,139 --> 03:08:46,612
“Miss Wood did not tell?”

3401
03:08:46,612 --> 03:08:47,630
“Not she!

3402
03:08:47,630 --> 03:08:49,300
She’ll never open her head.

3403
03:08:49,300 --> 03:08:51,613
She can take care of herself, you bet!”

3404
03:08:51,613 --> 03:08:56,116
The fiddles sounded hilariously in the
house, and the feet also.

3405
03:08:56,116 --> 03:08:59,794
They had warmed up altogether,
and their dancing figures crossed the

3406
03:08:59,794 --> 03:09:01,379
windows back and forth.

3407
03:09:01,379 --> 03:09:05,985
The two cowpunchers drew near to a window
and looked in gloomily.

3408
03:09:05,985 --> 03:09:08,139
“There she goes,” said Lin.

3409
03:09:08,139 --> 03:09:12,568
“With Uncle Hughey again,”
said the Virginian, sourly.

3410
03:09:12,568 --> 03:09:16,330
“Yu’ might suppose he didn’t have a wife
and twins, to see the way

3411
03:09:16,330 --> 03:09:17,821
he goes gambollin’ around.”

3412
03:09:17,821 --> 03:09:20,770
“Westfall is takin’ a turn with
her now,” said McLean.

3413
03:09:20,770 --> 03:09:21,733
“James!”

3414
03:09:21,733 --> 03:09:23,086
exclaimed the Virginian.

3415
03:09:23,086 --> 03:09:26,721
“He’s another with a wife and fam’ly,
and he gets the dancin’, too.”

3416
03:09:26,721 --> 03:09:30,521
“There she goes with Taylor,”
said Lin, presently.

3417
03:09:30,521 --> 03:09:32,254
“Another married man!”

3418
03:09:32,254 --> 03:09:33,895
the Southerner commented.

3419
03:09:33,895 --> 03:09:37,302
They prowled round to the storeroom,
and passed through the kitchen to where

3420
03:09:37,302 --> 03:09:42,057
the dancers were robustly tramping.

3421
03:09:42,057 --> 03:09:47,372
Miss Wood was still the
partner of Mr. Taylor.

3422
03:09:47,372 --> 03:09:49,842
“Let’s have some whiskey,”
said the Virginian.

3423
03:09:49,842 --> 03:09:54,210
They had it, and returned,
and the Virginian’s disgust and sense

3424
03:09:54,210 --> 03:09:56,251
of injury grew deeper.

3425
03:09:56,251 --> 03:10:00,494
“Old Carmody has got her now,” he drawled.

3426
03:10:00,494 --> 03:10:04,976
“He polkas like a landslide.

3427
03:10:04,976 --> 03:10:09,907
She learns his monkey-faced kid to spell
dog and cow all the mawnin’.

3428
03:10:09,907 --> -1:59:59,000
He’d ought to be tucked up cozy in his
bed right now, old Carmody ought.

3429
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3430
03:10:13,809 --> 03:10:18,654
They were standing in that place set
apart for the sleeping children;

3431
03:10:18,654 --> 03:10:23,893
and just at this moment one of two
babies that were stowed beneath a chair

3432
03:10:23,893 --> 03:10:25,616
uttered a drowsy note.

3433
03:10:25,616 --> 03:10:30,509
A much louder cry, indeed a chorus of
lament, would have been needed to reach

3434
03:10:30,509 --> 03:10:34,709
the ears of the parents in the room
beyond, such was the noisy

3435
03:10:34,709 --> 03:10:36,591
volume of the dance.

3436
03:10:36,591 --> 03:10:41,273
But in this quiet place the light sound
caught Mr. McLean’s attention,

3437
03:10:41,273 --> 03:10:43,536
and he turned to see
if anything were wrong.

3438
03:10:43,536 --> 03:10:46,011
But both babies were sleeping peacefully.

3439
03:10:46,011 --> 03:10:48,159
“Them’s Uncle Hughey’s twins,” he said.

3440
03:10:48,159 --> 03:10:49,613
“How do you happen to know that?”

3441
03:10:49,613 --> 03:10:52,677
inquired the Virginian,
suddenly interested.

3442
03:10:52,677 --> 03:10:57,227
“Saw his wife put ’em under the chair so
she could find ’em right off when she

3443
03:10:57,227 --> 03:10:58,353
come to go home.”

3444
03:10:58,353 --> 03:11:00,928
“Oh,” said the Virginian, thoughtfully.

3445
03:11:00,928 --> 03:11:03,084
“Oh, find ’em right off.

3446
03:11:03,084 --> 03:11:04,099
Yes.

3447
03:11:04,099 --> 03:11:05,306
Uncle Hughey’s twins.”

3448
03:11:05,306 --> 03:11:08,038
He walked to a spot from which he
could view the dance.

3449
03:11:08,038 --> 03:11:12,064
“Well,” he continued,
returning, “the schoolmarm must have

3450
03:11:12,064 --> 03:11:14,437
taken quite a notion to Uncle Hughey.

3451
03:11:14,437 --> 03:11:16,583
He has got her for this quadrille.”

3452
03:11:16,583 --> 03:11:20,503
The Virginian was now speaking without
rancor; but his words came with a

3453
03:11:20,503 --> 03:11:26,226
slightly augmented drawl,
and this with him was often a bad omen.

3454
03:11:26,226 --> 03:11:31,290
He now turned his eyes upon the collected
babies wrapped in various colored

3455
03:11:31,290 --> 03:11:33,045
shawls and knitted work.

3456
03:11:33,045 --> 03:11:39,344
“Nine, ten, eleven, beautiful sleepin’
strangers,” he counted, in a sweet

3457
03:11:39,344 --> 03:11:40,147
voice.

3458
03:11:40,147 --> 03:11:41,775
“Any of ’em your’n, Lin?”

3459
03:11:41,775 --> 03:11:44,968
“Not that I know of,” grinned Mr. McLean.

3460
03:11:44,968 --> 03:11:47,887
“Eleven, twelve.

3461
03:11:47,887 --> 03:11:54,340
This hyeh is little Christopher in the
blue-stripe quilt⁠—or maybe that other

3462
03:11:54,340 --> 03:11:55,860
yello’-head is him.

3463
03:11:55,860 --> 03:12:00,340
The angels have commenced to drop in on
us right smart along Bear Creek, Lin.”

3464
03:12:00,340 --> 03:12:02,545
“What trash are yu’ talkin’ anyway?”

3465
03:12:02,545 --> 03:12:06,931
“If they look so awful alike in the
heavenly gyarden,” the gentle Southerner

3466
03:12:06,931 --> 03:12:11,083
continued, “I’d just hate to be the
folks that has the cuttin’ of ’em out

3467
03:12:11,083 --> 03:12:12,734
o’ the general herd.

3468
03:12:12,734 --> 03:12:16,428
And that’s a right quaint notion
too,” he added softly.

3469
03:12:16,428 --> 03:12:19,156
“Them under the chair are Uncle Hughey’s,
didn’t you tell me?”

3470
03:12:19,156 --> 03:12:23,374
And stooping, he lifted the torpid babies
and placed them beneath a table.

3471
03:12:23,374 --> 03:12:26,267
“No, that ain’t thorough,” he murmured.

3472
03:12:26,267 --> 03:12:30,984
With wonderful dexterity and solicitude
for their welfare, he removed the loose

3473
03:12:30,984 --> 03:12:34,024
wrap which was around them,
and this soon led to an

3474
03:12:34,024 --> 03:12:36,637
intricate process of exchange.

3475
03:12:36,637 --> 03:12:41,118
For a moment Mr. McLean had been staring
at the Virginian, puzzled.

3476
03:12:41,118 --> 03:12:46,379
Then, with a joyful yelp of
enlightenment, he sprang to abet him.

3477
03:12:46,379 --> 03:12:50,582
And while both busied themselves with the
shawls and quilts, the unconscious

3478
03:12:50,582 --> 03:12:54,778
parents went dancing vigorously on,
and the small, occasional cries of their

3479
03:12:54,778 --> 03:12:56,519
progeny did not reach them.

3480
03:12:56,519 --> 03:12:57,864
CHAPTER XI

3481
03:12:57,864 --> 03:13:00,889
“You’re Going to Love Me
Before We Get Through”

3482
03:13:00,889 --> 03:13:02,927
The Swinton barbecue was over.

3483
03:13:02,927 --> 03:13:06,903
The fiddles were silent,
the steer was eaten,

3484
03:13:06,903 --> 03:13:11,136
the barrel emptied, or largely so,
and the tapers extinguished;

3485
03:13:11,136 --> 03:13:16,308
round the house and sunken fire all
movement of guests was quiet;

3486
03:13:16,308 --> 03:13:20,893
the families were long departed
homeward, and after their hospitable

3487
03:13:20,893 --> 03:13:23,349
turbulence, the Swintons slept.

3488
03:13:23,349 --> 03:13:27,763
Mr. and Mrs. Westfall drove through the
night, and as they neared their cabin

3489
03:13:27,763 --> 03:13:31,834
there came from among the bundled wraps
a still, small voice.

3490
03:13:31,834 --> 03:13:35,245
“Jim,” said his wife,
“I said Alfred would catch cold.”

3491
03:13:35,245 --> 03:13:35,945
“Bosh!

3492
03:13:35,945 --> 03:13:37,747
Lizzie, don’t you fret.

3493
03:13:37,747 --> 03:13:41,101
He’s a little more than a yearlin’, and
of course he’ll snuffle.”

3494
03:13:41,101 --> 03:13:43,727
And young James took a kiss from his love.

3495
03:13:43,727 --> 03:13:48,910
“Well, how you can speak of Alfred that
way, calling him a yearling,

3496
03:13:48,910 --> 03:13:52,510
as if he was a calf,
and he just as much your child as mine,

3497
03:13:52,510 --> 03:13:55,871
I don’t see, James Westfall!”

3498
03:13:55,871 --> 03:13:58,718
“Why, what under the sun do you mean?”

3499
03:13:58,718 --> 03:14:00,431
“There he goes again!

3500
03:14:00,431 --> 03:14:03,570
Do hurry up home, Jim.

3501
03:14:03,570 --> -1:59:59,000
He’s got a real strange cough.

3502
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3503
03:14:06,809 --> 03:14:07,978
So they hurried home.

3504
03:14:07,978 --> 03:14:13,044
Soon the nine miles were finished,
and good James was unhitching by his

3505
03:14:13,044 --> 03:14:17,680
stable lantern, while his wife in the
house hastened to commit

3506
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:19,492
their offspring to bed.

3507
03:14:19,492 --> 03:14:23,099
The traces had dropped,
and each horse marched forward for

3508
03:14:23,099 --> 03:14:25,836
further unbuckling, when
James heard himself called.

3509
03:14:25,836 --> 03:14:30,568
Indeed, there was that in his wife’s
voice which made him jerk out his

3510
03:14:30,568 --> 03:14:31,948
pistol as he ran.

3511
03:14:31,948 --> 03:14:38,125
But it was no bear or Indian⁠—only two
strange children on the bed.

3512
03:14:38,125 --> 03:14:40,654
His wife was glaring at them.

3513
03:14:40,654 --> 03:14:43,840
He sighed with relief and
laid down the pistol.

3514
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:47,350
“Put that on again, James Westfall.

3515
03:14:47,350 --> 03:14:48,249
You’ll need it.

3516
03:14:48,249 --> 03:14:49,381
Look here!”

3517
03:14:49,381 --> 03:14:51,372
“Well, they won’t bite.

3518
03:14:51,372 --> 03:14:52,247
Whose are they?

3519
03:14:52,247 --> 03:14:53,693
Where have you stowed ourn?”

3520
03:14:53,693 --> 03:14:57,573
“Where have I⁠—” Utterance forsook this
mother for a moment.

3521
03:14:57,573 --> 03:14:58,998
“And you ask me!”

3522
03:14:58,998 --> 03:15:00,726
she continued.

3523
03:15:00,726 --> 03:15:03,345
“Ask Lin McLean.

3524
03:15:03,345 --> 03:15:08,500
Ask him that sets bulls on folks and
steals slippers, what he’s done with our

3525
03:15:08,500 --> 03:15:13,252
innocent lambs, mixing them up with
other people’s coughing, unhealthy

3526
03:15:13,252 --> 03:15:14,332
brats.

3527
03:15:14,332 --> 03:15:17,893
That’s Charlie Taylor in Alfred’s
clothes, and I know Alfred didn’t cough

3528
03:15:17,893 --> 03:15:21,424
like that, and I said to you it was
strange; and the other one that’s been

3529
03:15:21,424 --> -1:59:59,000
put in Christopher’s new quilts is not
even a bub⁠—bub⁠—boy!

3530
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3531
03:15:25,320 --> 03:15:31,656
As this crime against society loomed
clear to James Westfall’s understanding,

3532
03:15:31,656 --> 03:15:36,686
he sat down on the nearest piece of
furniture, and heedless of his wife’s

3533
03:15:36,686 --> 03:15:41,553
tears and his exchanged children,
broke into unregenerate laughter.

3534
03:15:41,553 --> 03:15:45,742
Doubtless after his sharp alarm about the
bear, he was unstrung.

3535
03:15:45,742 --> 03:15:50,438
His lady, however, promptly restrung him;
and by the time they had repacked the

3536
03:15:50,438 --> 03:15:53,803
now clamorous changelings,
and were rattling on their way to the

3537
03:15:53,803 --> 03:15:58,743
Taylors’, he began to share her outraged
feelings properly, as a husband

3538
03:15:58,743 --> 03:16:00,457
and a father should;

3539
03:16:00,457 --> 03:16:04,177
but when he reached the Taylors’ and
learned from Miss Wood that at this

3540
03:16:04,177 --> 03:16:08,112
house a child had been unwrapped whom
nobody could at all identify,

3541
03:16:08,112 --> 03:16:11,227
and that Mr. and Mrs. Taylor were
already far on the road to the

3542
03:16:11,227 --> 03:16:17,724
Swintons’, James Westfall whipped up his
horses and grew almost as thirsty for

3543
03:16:17,724 --> 03:16:20,044
revenge as was his wife.

3544
03:16:20,044 --> 03:16:27,260
Where the steer had been roasted,
the powdered ashes were now cold white,

3545
03:16:27,260 --> 03:16:31,558
and Mr. McLean, feeling through his
dreams the change of dawn come over the

3546
03:16:31,558 --> 03:16:38,576
air, sat up cautiously among the outdoor
slumberers and waked his neighbor.

3547
03:16:38,576 --> 03:16:42,838
“Day will be soon,” he whispered,
“and we must light out of this.

3548
03:16:42,838 --> -1:59:59,000
I never suspicioned yu’ had that much of
the devil in you before.

3549
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3550
03:16:46,708 --> 03:16:50,910
“I reckon some of the fellows will act
haidstrong,” the Virginian murmured

3551
03:16:50,910 --> 03:16:54,705
luxuriously, among the
warmth of his blankets.

3552
03:16:54,705 --> 03:16:59,191
“I tell yu’ we must skip,”
said Lin, for the second time;

3553
03:16:59,191 --> 03:17:03,505
and he rubbed the Virginian’s black
head, which alone was visible.

3554
03:17:03,505 --> 03:17:10,227
“Skip, then, you,” came muffled from
within, “and keep you’self mighty sca’ce

3555
03:17:10,227 --> 03:17:12,543
till they can appreciate our frolic.”

3556
03:17:12,543 --> 03:17:16,601
The Southerner withdrew deeper into his
bed, and Mr. McLean,

3557
03:17:16,601 --> 03:17:23,671
informing him that he was a fool,
arose and saddled his horse.

3558
03:17:23,671 --> 03:17:29,192
From the saddlebag, he brought a parcel,
and lightly laying this beside Bokay

3559
03:17:29,192 --> 03:17:32,032
Baldy, he mounted and was gone.

3560
03:17:32,032 --> 03:17:34,878
When Baldy awoke later,
he found the parcel to be a

3561
03:17:34,878 --> 03:17:37,073
pair of flowery slippers.

3562
03:17:37,073 --> 03:17:42,656
In selecting the inert Virginian as the
fool, Mr. McLean was scarcely wise;

3563
03:17:42,656 --> 03:17:45,016
it is the absent who are always guilty.

3564
03:17:45,016 --> 03:17:50,188
Before ever Lin could have been a mile in
retreat, the rattle of the wheels roused

3565
03:17:50,188 --> 03:17:52,519
all of them, and here came the Taylors.

3566
03:17:52,519 --> 03:17:55,806
Before the Taylors’ knocking had brought
the Swintons to their door,

3567
03:17:55,806 --> 03:17:59,279
other wheels sounded,
and here were Mr. and Mrs. Carmody,

3568
03:17:59,279 --> 03:18:03,567
and Uncle Hughey with his wife,
and close after them Mr. Dow,

3569
03:18:03,567 --> 03:18:09,586
alone, who told how his wife had gone
into one of her fits⁠—she upon whom Dr.

3570
03:18:09,586 --> 03:18:14,257
Barker at Drybone had enjoined total
abstinence from all excitement.

3571
03:18:14,257 --> 03:18:18,827
Voices of women and children began to be
uplifted; the Westfalls arrived in a

3572
03:18:18,827 --> 03:18:20,644
lather, and the Thomases;

3573
03:18:20,644 --> 03:18:25,111
and by sunrise, what with fathers and
mothers and spectators and loud

3574
03:18:25,111 --> 03:18:29,187
offspring, there was gathered such a
meeting as has seldom been before among

3575
03:18:29,187 --> 03:18:34,107
the generations of speaking men.

3576
03:18:34,107 --> 03:18:38,445
Today you can hear legends of it from
Texas to Montana; but I am giving

3577
03:18:38,445 --> 03:18:40,391
you the full particulars.

3578
03:18:40,391 --> 03:18:43,531
Of course they pitched upon poor Lin.

3579
03:18:43,531 --> 03:18:47,927
Here was the Virginian doing his best,
holding horses and helping ladies

3580
03:18:47,927 --> 03:18:52,432
descend, while the name of McLean began
to be muttered with threats.

3581
03:18:52,432 --> 03:18:57,924
Soon a party led by Mr. Dow set forth in
search of him, and the Southerner

3582
03:18:57,924 --> 03:19:01,719
debated a moment if he had better not
put them on a wrong track.

3583
03:19:01,719 --> 03:19:04,990
But he concluded that they might
safely go on searching.

3584
03:19:04,990 --> 03:19:05,394
Mrs.

3585
03:19:05,394 --> 03:19:09,741
Westfall found Christopher at once in the
green shawl of Anna Maria Dow,

3586
03:19:09,741 --> 03:19:13,153
but all was not achieved thus in the
twinkling of an eye.

3587
03:19:13,153 --> 03:19:13,486
Mr.

3588
03:19:13,486 --> 03:19:18,686
McLean had, it appeared,
as James Westfall lugubriously pointed

3589
03:19:18,686 --> 03:19:25,573
out, not merely “swapped the duds;
he had shuffled the whole doggone deck;”

3590
03:19:25,573 --> 03:19:28,305
and they cursed this Satanic invention.

3591
03:19:28,305 --> 03:19:32,004
The fathers were but of moderate
assistance; it was the mothers who did

3592
03:19:32,004 --> 03:19:36,844
the heavy work; and by ten o’clock some
unsolved problems grew so delicate that

3593
03:19:36,844 --> 03:19:42,386
a ladies’ caucus was organized in a
private room⁠—no admittance for men⁠—and

3594
03:19:42,386 --> 03:19:45,594
what was done there I can only surmise.

3595
03:19:45,594 --> 03:19:50,172
During its progress the
search party returned.

3596
03:19:50,172 --> 03:19:57,004
It had not found Mr. McLean.

3597
03:19:57,373 --> 03:20:03,506
It had found a tree with a notice pegged
upon it, reading, “God bless our home!”

3598
03:20:03,506 --> 03:20:04,946
This was captured.

3599
03:20:04,946 --> 03:20:09,018
But success attended the caucus;
each mother emerged,

3600
03:20:09,018 --> 03:20:13,528
satisfied that she had received her own,
and each sire, now that his family was

3601
03:20:13,528 --> 03:20:17,668
itself again, began to look
at his neighbor sideways.

3602
03:20:17,668 --> 03:20:23,023
After a man has been angry enough to kill
another man, after the fire of righteous

3603
03:20:23,023 --> 03:20:29,625
slaughter has raged in his heart as it
had certainly raged for several hours in

3604
03:20:29,625 --> 03:20:34,357
the hearts of these fathers,
the flame will usually burn itself out.

3605
03:20:34,357 --> 03:20:38,237
This will be so in a generous nature,
unless the cause of the

3606
03:20:38,237 --> 03:20:40,630
anger is still unchanged.

3607
03:20:40,630 --> 03:20:44,569
But the children had been identified;
none had taken hurt.

3608
03:20:44,569 --> 03:20:48,447
All had been humanely
given their nourishment.

3609
03:20:48,447 --> 03:20:49,697
The thing was over.

3610
03:20:49,697 --> 03:20:51,018
The day was beautiful.

3611
03:20:51,018 --> 03:20:54,971
A tempting feast remained
from the barbecue.

3612
03:20:54,971 --> 03:20:59,916
These Bear Creek fathers could not keep
their ire at red heat.

3613
03:20:59,916 --> 03:21:02,996
Most of them, being as yet more their
wives’ lovers than their

3614
03:21:02,996 --> 03:21:04,451
children’s parents

3615
03:21:04,451 --> 03:21:08,484
, began to see the mirthful side of the
adventure; and they ceased to feel very

3616
03:21:08,484 --> 03:21:10,289
severely toward Lin McLean.

3617
03:21:10,289 --> 03:21:13,744
Not so the women.

3618
03:21:13,744 --> 03:21:16,826
They cried for vengeance;
but they cried in vain,

3619
03:21:16,826 --> 03:21:18,714
and were met with smiles.

3620
03:21:18,714 --> 03:21:19,123
Mrs.

3621
03:21:19,123 --> 03:21:23,803
Westfall argued long that punishment
should be dealt the offender.

3622
03:21:23,803 --> 03:21:27,843
“Anyway,” she persisted,
“it was real defiant of him putting that

3623
03:21:27,843 --> 03:21:28,803
up on the tree.

3624
03:21:28,803 --> 03:21:30,861
I might forgive him but for that.”

3625
03:21:30,861 --> 03:21:35,721
“Yes,” spoke the Virginian in their
midst, “that wasn’t sort o’ right.

3626
03:21:35,721 --> -1:59:59,000
Especially as I am the man you’re huntin’.

3627
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3628
03:21:36,961 --> 03:21:37,017
They sat dumb at his assurance.

3629
03:21:37,017 --> 03:21:38,881
“Come and kill me,” he continued,
round upon the party.

3630
03:21:38,881 --> 03:21:38,881
“I’ll not resist.”

3631
03:21:38,881 --> 03:21:40,161
But they could not resist the way in
which he had looked round upon them.

3632
03:21:40,161 --> 03:21:41,201
He had chosen the right moment for his
confession, as a captain of a horse

3633
03:21:41,201 --> 03:21:43,184
awaits the proper time for a charge.

3634
03:21:43,184 --> 03:21:44,064
Some rebukes he did receive;
the worst came from the mothers.

3635
03:21:44,064 --> 03:21:44,064
And all that he could say for himself
was, “I am getting off too easy.”

3636
03:21:44,064 --> 03:21:44,134
“But what was your point?”

3637
03:21:44,134 --> 03:21:44,985
said Westfall.

3638
03:21:44,985 --> 03:21:46,024
“Blamed if I know any more.

3639
03:21:46,024 --> 03:21:47,646
I expect it must have been the whiskey.”

3640
03:21:47,646 --> 03:21:50,126
“I would mind it less,”
said Mrs. Westfall, “if you looked a

3641
03:21:50,126 --> 03:21:51,526
bit sorry or ashamed.”

3642
03:21:51,526 --> 03:21:51,646
The Virginian shook his
head at her penitently.

3643
03:21:51,646 --> 03:21:51,646
“I’m tryin’ to,” he said.

3644
03:21:51,646 --> 03:21:51,646
And thus he sat disarming his accusers
until they began to lunch upon the

3645
03:21:51,646 --> 03:21:51,646
copious remnants of the barbecue.

3646
03:21:51,646 --> 03:21:51,726
He did not join them at this meal.

3647
03:21:51,726 --> 03:21:52,686
In telling you that Mrs. Dow was the only
lady absent upon this historic morning,

3648
03:21:52,686 --> 03:21:52,686
I was guilty of an inadvertence.

3649
03:21:52,686 --> 03:21:52,686
There was one other.

3650
03:21:52,686 --> 03:21:53,606
The Virginian rode away sedately through
the autumn sunshine;

3651
03:21:53,606 --> 03:21:53,806
and as he went he asked his
Monte horse a question.

3652
03:21:53,806 --> 03:21:54,206
“Do yu’ reckon she’ll have forgotten you
too, you pie-biter?”

3653
03:21:54,206 --> 03:21:54,298
said he.

3654
03:21:54,298 --> 03:21:55,046
Instead of the new trousers,
the cowpuncher’s leathern chaps

3655
03:21:55,046 --> 03:21:55,406
were on his legs.

3656
03:21:55,406 --> 03:21:56,286
But he had the new scarf
knotted at his neck.

3657
03:21:56,286 --> 03:21:58,068
Most men would gladly have
equalled him in appearance.

3658
03:21:58,068 --> 03:22:00,028
“You Monte,” said he,
“will she be at home?”

3659
03:22:00,028 --> 03:22:00,188
It was Sunday, and no school day,
and he found her in her cabin that stood

3660
03:22:00,188 --> 03:22:01,668
next the Taylors’ house.

3661
03:22:01,668 --> 03:22:03,108
Her eyes were very bright.

3662
03:22:03,108 --> 03:22:04,348
“I’d thought I’d just call,” said he.

3663
03:22:04,348 --> 03:22:05,059
“Why, that’s such a pity!

3664
03:22:05,059 --> 03:22:06,468
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are away.”

3665
03:22:06,468 --> 03:22:07,108
“Yes; they’ve been right busy.

3666
03:22:07,108 --> 03:22:08,188
That’s why I thought I’d call.

3667
03:22:08,188 --> 03:22:09,953
Will yu’ come for a ride, ma’am?”

3668
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
“Dear me!

3669
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
I⁠—”

3670
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
“You can ride my hawss.

3671
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
He’s gentle.”

3672
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
“What!

3673
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:09,953
And you walk?”

3674
03:22:09,953 --> 03:22:11,033
“No, ma’am.

3675
03:22:11,033 --> 03:22:12,793
Nor the two of us ride
him this time, either.”

3676
03:22:12,793 --> 03:22:15,113
At this she turned entirely pink,
and he, noticing, went on quietly:

3677
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,113
“I’ll catch up one of Taylor’s hawsses.

3678
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,113
Taylor knows me.”

3679
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,113
“No.

3680
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,113
I don’t really think I could do that.

3681
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,113
But thank you.

3682
03:22:15,113 --> 03:22:15,193
Thank you very much.

3683
03:22:15,193 --> 03:22:17,685
I must go now and see how
Mrs. Taylor’s fire is.”

3684
03:22:17,685 --> 03:22:18,005
“I’ll look after that, ma’am.

3685
03:22:18,005 --> 03:22:18,365
I’d like for yu’ to go ridin’ mighty well.

3686
03:22:18,365 --> 03:22:21,489
Yu’ have no babies this mawnin’
to be anxious after.”

3687
03:22:21,489 --> 03:22:22,969
At this shaft, Grandmother Stark flashed
awake deep within the spirit of her

3688
03:22:22,969 --> 03:22:23,289
descendant, and she made a
haughty declaration of war.

3689
03:22:23,289 --> 03:22:23,649
“I don’t know what you
mean, sir,” she said.

3690
03:22:23,649 --> 03:22:24,609
Now was his danger; for it was easy to
fall into mere crude impertinence and

3691
03:22:24,609 --> 03:22:26,380
ask her why, then, did
she speak thus abruptly?

3692
03:22:26,380 --> 03:22:27,553
There were various easy things of this
kind for him to say.

3693
03:22:27,553 --> 03:22:27,759
And any rudeness would have
lost him the battle.

3694
03:22:27,759 --> 03:22:29,975
But the Virginian was not the man to lose
such a battle in such a way.

3695
03:22:29,975 --> 03:22:29,975
His shaft had hit.

3696
03:22:29,975 --> 03:22:29,975
She thought he referred to those babies
about whom last night she had

3697
03:22:29,975 --> 03:22:29,975
shown such superfluous solicitude.

3698
03:22:29,975 --> 03:22:29,975
Her conscience was guilty.

3699
03:22:29,975 --> 03:22:31,015
This was all that he had wished to make
sure of before he began operations.

3700
03:22:31,015 --> 03:22:32,195
“Why, I mean,” said he,
easily, sitting down near the

3701
03:22:32,195 --> 03:22:33,395
door, “that it’s Sunday.

3702
03:22:33,395 --> 03:22:35,035
School don’t hinder yu’ from
enjoyin’ a ride today.

3703
03:22:35,035 --> 03:22:35,715
You’ll teach the kids all the better
for it tomorro’, ma’am.

3704
03:22:35,715 --> 03:22:35,755
Maybe it’s your duty.”

3705
03:22:35,755 --> 03:22:36,635
And he smiled at her.

3706
03:22:36,635 --> 03:22:36,635
“My duty!

3707
03:22:36,635 --> 03:22:36,635
It’s quite novel to have strangers⁠—”

3708
03:22:36,635 --> 03:22:36,635
“Am I a stranger?”

3709
03:22:36,635 --> 03:22:36,635
he cut in, firing his first broadside.

3710
03:22:36,635 --> 03:22:37,755
“I was introduced, ma’am,”
he continued, noting how

3711
03:22:37,755 --> 03:22:38,155
she had flushed again.

3712
03:22:38,155 --> 03:22:40,395
“And I would not be oversteppin’
for the world.

3713
03:22:40,395 --> 03:22:42,000
I’ll go away if yu’ want.”

3714
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:43,475
And hereupon he quietly rose,
and stood, hat in hand.

3715
03:22:43,475 --> 03:22:43,875
Molly was flustered.

3716
03:22:43,875 --> 03:22:45,197
She did not at all want him to go.

3717
03:22:45,197 --> 03:22:47,037
No one of her admirers had ever
been like this creature.

3718
03:22:47,037 --> 03:22:47,597
The fringed leathern chaparreros,
the cartridge belt, the flannel shirt,

3719
03:22:47,597 --> 03:22:47,957
the knotted scarf at the neck,
these things were now an

3720
03:22:47,957 --> 03:22:48,157
old story to her.

3721
03:22:48,157 --> 03:22:49,117
Since her arrival she had seen young men
and old in plenty dressed thus.

3722
03:22:49,117 --> 03:22:50,117
But worn by this man now standing by her
door, they seemed to radiate romance.

3723
03:22:50,117 --> 03:22:51,237
She did not want him to go⁠—and she
wished to win her battle.

3724
03:22:51,237 --> 03:22:52,597
And now in her agitation she became
suddenly severe, as she had

3725
03:22:52,597 --> 03:22:52,837
done at Hoosic Junction.

3726
03:22:52,837 --> 03:22:54,717
He should have a punishment to remember!

3727
03:22:54,717 --> 03:22:55,557
“You call yourself a man,
I suppose,” she said.

3728
03:22:55,557 --> 03:22:56,197
But he did not tremble in the least.

3729
03:22:56,197 --> 03:22:57,357
Her fierceness filled him with delight,
and the tender desire of

3730
03:22:57,357 --> 03:22:58,370
ownership flooded through him.

3731
03:22:58,370 --> 03:23:00,244
“A grown-up, responsible
man,” she repeated.

3732
03:23:00,244 --> 03:23:00,244
“Yes, ma’am.

3733
03:23:00,244 --> 03:23:00,284
I think so.”

3734
03:23:00,284 --> 03:23:01,008
He now sat down again.

3735
03:23:01,008 --> 03:23:03,128
“And you let them think that⁠—that Mr.
McLean⁠—You dare not look me in the face

3736
03:23:03,128 --> 03:23:05,069
and say that Mr. McLean
did that last night!”

3737
03:23:05,069 --> 03:23:05,909
“I reckon I dassent.”

3738
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
“There!

3739
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
I knew it!

3740
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
I said so from the first!”

3741
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
“And me a stranger to you!”

3742
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
he murmured.

3743
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
It was his second broadside.

3744
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
It left her badly crippled.

3745
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:05,909
She was silent.

3746
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:07,169
“Who did yu’ mention it to, ma’am?”

3747
03:23:07,169 --> 03:23:07,259
She hoped she had him.

3748
03:23:07,259 --> 03:23:08,249
“Why, are you afraid?”

3749
03:23:08,249 --> 03:23:08,489
And she laughed lightly.

3750
03:23:08,489 --> 03:23:09,880
“I told ’em myself.

3751
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:11,874
And their astonishment seemed so genu-
wine I’d just hate to think they had

3752
03:23:11,874 --> 03:23:13,037
fooled me that thorough when they knowed
it all along from you seeing me.”

3753
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,037
“I did not see you.

3754
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,037
I knew it must⁠—of course I
did not tell anyone.

3755
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,037
When I said I said so from the first,
I meant⁠—you can understand

3756
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,037
perfectly what I meant.”

3757
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,037
“Yes, ma’am.”

3758
03:23:13,037 --> 03:23:13,077
Poor Molly was near stamping her foot.

3759
03:23:13,077 --> 03:23:15,305
“And what sort of a trick,”
she rushed on, “was that to play?

3760
03:23:15,305 --> 03:23:16,917
Do you call it a manly thing to frighten
and distress women because you⁠—for

3761
03:23:16,917 --> 03:23:17,677
no reason at all?

3762
03:23:17,677 --> 03:23:20,320
I should never have imagined it could be
the act of a person who wears a big

3763
03:23:20,320 --> 03:23:21,718
pistol and rides a big horse.

3764
03:23:21,718 --> 03:23:22,798
I should be afraid to go riding with
such an immature protector.”

3765
03:23:22,798 --> 03:23:23,489
“Yes; that was awful childish.

3766
03:23:23,489 --> 03:23:26,329
Your words do cut a little;
for maybe there’s been times when I have

3767
03:23:26,329 --> 03:23:26,969
acted pretty near like a man.

3768
03:23:26,969 --> 03:23:29,969
But I cert’nly forgot to be introduced
before I spoke to yu’ last night.

3769
03:23:29,969 --> 03:23:29,969
Because why?

3770
03:23:29,969 --> 03:23:29,969
You’ve found me out dead in one thing.

3771
03:23:29,969 --> 03:23:29,969
Won’t you take a guess at this too?”

3772
03:23:29,969 --> 03:23:30,809
“I cannot sit guessing why people do not
behave themselves⁠—who

3773
03:23:30,809 --> 03:23:30,884
seem to know better.”

3774
03:23:30,884 --> 03:23:32,249
“Well, ma’am, I’ve played square and
owned up to yu’.

3775
03:23:32,249 --> 03:23:32,969
And that’s not what you’re doin’ by me.

3776
03:23:32,969 --> 03:23:34,409
I ask your pardon if I say what I have a
right to say in language not as good as

3777
03:23:34,409 --> 03:23:35,689
I’d like to talk to yu’ with.

3778
03:23:35,689 --> 03:23:37,209
But at South Fork Crossin’
who did any introducin’?

3779
03:23:37,209 --> -1:59:59,000
Did yu’ complain I was a stranger then?

3780
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
”

3781
03:23:39,969 --> 03:23:40,409
“I⁠—no!”

3782
03:23:40,409 --> 03:23:40,449
she flashed out; then,
quite sweetly, “The driver told me it

3783
03:23:40,449 --> 03:23:41,489
wasn’t really so dangerous
there, you know.”

3784
03:23:41,489 --> 03:23:41,579
“That’s not the point I’m makin’.

3785
03:23:41,579 --> 03:23:43,369
You are a grown-up woman,
a responsible woman.

3786
03:23:43,369 --> 03:23:45,969
You’ve come ever so far,
and all alone, to a rough country to

3787
03:23:45,969 --> 03:23:47,426
instruct young children that play
games⁠—tag, and hide-and-seek,

3788
03:23:47,426 --> 03:23:48,267
and fooleries they’ll have to quit
when they get old.

3789
03:23:48,267 --> 03:23:50,329
Don’t you think pretendin’ yu’ don’t know
a man⁠—his name’s nothin’, but him⁠—a

3790
03:23:50,329 --> 03:23:52,610
man whom you were glad enough to let
assist yu’ when somebody was needed⁠—

3791
03:23:52,610 --> 03:23:53,970
don’t you think that’s mighty close to
hide-and-seek them children plays?

3792
03:23:53,970 --> 03:23:56,974
I ain’t so sure but what there’s a pair
of us children in this hyeh room.”

3793
03:23:56,974 --> 03:23:58,214
Molly Wood was regarding him saucily.

3794
03:23:58,214 --> 03:23:59,654
“I don’t think I like you,” said she.

3795
03:23:59,654 --> 03:24:01,274
“That’s all square enough.

3796
03:24:01,274 --> 03:24:02,714
You’re goin’ to love me
before we get through.

3797
03:24:02,714 --> 03:24:04,272
I wish yu’d come a-ridin, ma’am.”

3798
03:24:04,272 --> 03:24:05,383
“Dear, dear, dear!

3799
03:24:05,383 --> 03:24:05,904
So I’m going to love you?

3800
03:24:05,904 --> 03:24:07,184
How will you do it?

3801
03:24:07,184 --> 03:24:10,504
I know men think that they only need to
sit and look strong and make

3802
03:24:10,504 --> 03:24:11,434
chests at a girl⁠—”

3803
03:24:11,434 --> 03:24:12,515
“Goodness gracious!

3804
03:24:12,515 --> 03:24:13,235
I ain’t makin’ any chests at yu’!”

3805
03:24:13,235 --> 03:24:14,195
Laughter overcame him for a moment,
and Miss Wood liked his laugh very much.

3806
03:24:14,195 --> 03:24:15,275
“Please come a-ridin’,” he urged.

3807
03:24:15,275 --> 03:24:16,715
“It’s the prettiest kind of a day.”

3808
03:24:16,715 --> 03:24:18,435
She looked at him frankly,
and there was a pause.

3809
03:24:18,435 --> 03:24:18,995
“I will take back two things that I said
to you,” she then answered him.

3810
03:24:18,995 --> 03:24:19,875
“I believe that I do like you.

3811
03:24:19,875 --> 03:24:20,715
And I know that if I went riding with
you, I should not have

3812
03:24:20,715 --> 03:24:21,498
an immature protector.”

3813
03:24:21,498 --> 03:24:23,275
And then, with a final gesture of
acknowledgment, she held out

3814
03:24:23,275 --> 03:24:23,635
her hand to him.

3815
03:24:23,635 --> 03:24:25,645
“And I have always wanted,”
she said, “to thank you for what you

3816
03:24:25,645 --> 03:24:26,045
did at the river.”

3817
03:24:26,045 --> 03:24:28,147
He took her hand, and his heart bounded.

3818
03:24:28,147 --> 03:24:29,005
“You’re a gentleman!”

3819
03:24:29,005 --> 03:24:29,005
he exclaimed.

3820
03:24:29,005 --> 03:24:30,847
It was now her turn to
be overcome with merriment.

3821
03:24:30,847 --> 03:24:32,126
“I’ve always wanted to be
a man,” she said.

3822
03:24:32,126 --> 03:24:34,051
“I am mighty glad you ain’t,”
said he, looking at her.

3823
03:24:34,051 --> 03:24:37,045
But Molly had already received enough
broadsides for one day.

3824
03:24:37,045 --> 03:24:38,806
She could allow no more of them,
and she took herself capably in hand.

3825
03:24:38,806 --> 03:24:39,846
“Where did you learn to
make such pretty speeches?”

3826
03:24:39,846 --> 03:24:39,926
she asked.

3827
03:24:39,926 --> 03:24:41,246
“Well, never mind that.

3828
03:24:41,246 --> 03:24:43,246
One sees that you have had plenty of
practice for one so young.”

3829
03:24:43,246 --> 03:24:45,286
“I am twenty-seven,” blurted the
Virginian, and knew instantly that he

3830
03:24:45,286 --> 03:24:45,966
had spoken like a fool.

3831
03:24:45,966 --> 03:24:46,010
“Who would have dreamed it!”

3832
03:24:46,010 --> 03:24:48,424
said Molly, with well-measured mockery.

3833
03:24:48,424 --> 03:24:50,718
She knew that she had scored at last,
and that this day was hers.

3834
03:24:50,718 --> 03:24:52,838
“Don’t be too sure you are glad I’m not a
man,” she now told him.

3835
03:24:52,838 --> 03:24:55,450
There was something like a
challenge in her voice.

3836
03:24:55,450 --> 03:24:56,770
“I risk it,” he remarked.

3837
03:24:56,770 --> 03:24:59,548
“For I am almost twenty-
three myself,” she concluded.

3838
03:24:59,548 --> 03:25:01,074
And she gave him a look
on her own account.

3839
03:25:01,074 --> 03:25:02,122
“And you’ll not come a-ridin’?”

3840
03:25:02,122 --> 03:25:02,122
he persisted.

3841
03:25:02,122 --> 03:25:02,122
“No,” she answered him; “no.”

3842
03:25:02,122 --> 03:25:02,122
And he knew that he could not make her.

3843
03:25:02,122 --> 03:25:02,122
“Then I will tell yu’ goodbye,” said he.

3844
03:25:02,122 --> 03:25:02,122
“But I am comin’ again.
