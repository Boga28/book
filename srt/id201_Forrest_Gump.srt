CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,520
School and Football
 

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,880
I was born an idiot - but I'm cleverer 
than people think. I can think things OK,  

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,160
but when I have to say them or write them 
down, sometimes they come out all wrong.  

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:34,720
When I was born, my Mom named me Forrest. My 
daddy died just after I was born. He worked on  

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,920
the ships. One day a big box of bananas 
fell down on my daddy and killed him.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,600
I don't like bananas much. Only 
banana cake. I like that all right.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,480
At first when I was growing up, I played with 
everybody. But then some boys hit me, and my Mom  

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,840
didn't want me to play with them again. I tried 
to play with girls, but they all ran away from me.

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
I went to an ordinary school for a year.  

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
Then the children started 
laughing and running away from me.  

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:28,240
But one girl, Jenny Curran, didn't run away, and 
sometimes she walked home with me. She was nice.

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,800
Then they put me into another kind of school, 
and there were some strange boys there. Some  

14
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:46,640
couldn't eat or go to the toilet without help. 
I stayed in that school for five or six years.  

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,240
But when I was thirteen, I 
grew six inches in six months!  

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,840
And by the time I was sixteen, I was bigger and 
heavier than all the other boys in the school.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,560
One day I was walking home, and a car 
stopped next to me. The driver asked me  

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,240
my name, and I told him. 'What 
school do you go to?' he asked.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,440
I told him about the idiot school.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,360
'Do you ever play football?' he asked.

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
'No,' I told him. 'I see other people playing,  

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
but I don't play and they never 
ask me to play with them.'

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
'OK,' the man said.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,200
Three days later, the man in the car came 
and got me out of school. Mom was there,  

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,360
and they got all the things out of my 
desk and put them in a brown paper bag.  

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
Then they told me to say goodbye to the teacher.

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,280
The man in the car took me and Mom to the 
new high school. There, an old man with grey  

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,040
hair asked me lots of questions. But I knew 
that they really wanted me to play football.  

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,680
The man in the car was a football coach called 
Fellers. Coach Fellers asked me to put on a  

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:33,600
football suit, then asked me to undress and dress 
again, twenty times, until I could do it easily.

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,600
I began to play football with the high 
school team, and Coach Fellers helped me.  

32
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,480
And I went to lessons in the school. One 
teacher, Miss Henderson, was really nice.  

33
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:58,000
She taught me to read. And who do 
you think I saw in the school cafe?  

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,840
Jenny Curran! She was all grown-up 
now, with pretty black hair, long legs,  

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,480
and a beautiful face. I went and 
sat with her, and she remembered me!

36
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,360
But there was a boy in the cafe who started 
calling me names, and saying things like,  

37
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,960
'How's Stupid?'. Then he threw some milk at 
me, and I jumped out of my chair and ran away.  

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,440
A day or two later, after school in the afternoon, 
he and his friends came up to me and started  

39
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:53,200
pushing and hitting me. Then they ran after 
me across the football field. I ran away fast!

40
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,760
I saw that Coach Fellers was watching 
me. He had a strange look on his face,  

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,960
and he came and told me to put on my 
football suit. That afternoon, he gave me  

42
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:19,760
the ball to run with. The others started 
running after me, and I ran as fast as I could.  

43
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,640
When they caught me, it needed eight of them to 
pull me down! Coach Fellers was really happy!  

44
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,240
He started jumping up and down and laughing. 
And after that, everybody liked me.

45
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:48,080
We had our first game, and I was frightened. 
But they gave me the ball, and I ran  

46
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,640
over the goal line two or three times. 
People were really kind to me after that!

47
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
Then something happened which was not so good.

48
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,840
'I want to take Jenny Curran to 
the cinema,' I told Mom one day.

49
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:16,320
So she phoned Jenny's Mom and explained. Next 
evening, Jenny arrived at our house, wearing a  

50
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,640
white dress, and with a pink flower in her hair. 
She was the prettiest thing that I ever saw.

51
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:36,400
The cinema was not far from our house. Jenny 
got the tickets, and we went inside. The film  

52
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:45,920
was about a man and a woman, Bonnie and Clyde, 
and there was a lot of shooting and killing.  

53
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:58,160
Well, I laughed a lot. But when I did this, people 
looked at me, and Jenny got down lower and lower  

54
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:06,960
in her place. Once I thought she was on the floor, 
and I put my hand on her shoulder to pull her up.  

55
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,440
But I pulled her dress, and it 
came open, and she screamed.

56
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,160
I tried to put my hands in front of her, 
because there were people looking at us.  

57
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Then two men came and took me to 
an office. A few minutes later,  

58
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,480
four policemen arrived, and 
took me to the police station!

59
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Mom came to the police station. She was 
crying, and I knew that I was in trouble again.  

60
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:52,320
And I was in trouble, but I was lucky. Next 
day, a letter arrived from a university.  

61
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:01,360
It was good news: if I played in their football 
team, there was a place for me in school there.

62
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,440
And the police said, 'That's OK 
with us. Just get out of town!'

63
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,320
So the next morning, Mom put some things 
into a suitcase for me, and put me on a bus.  

64
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,840
She was crying again. But they 
started the bus, and away I went.
 
 
 

65
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,040
CHAPTER TWO

66
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
Life at University
 

67
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,400
When we got to the university, 
Coach Bryant came to talk to us.

68
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,120
'Last man to get to the practice field 
will get a ride there on my shoe!'  

69
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,760
he shouted at us. And he meant it when he 
said that kind of thing. We soon learned that.

70
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,040
The building that I went to live in was 
nice on the outside but not on the inside.  

71
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Most of the doors and windows were 
broken, and the floor was dirty.  

72
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:22,000
I lived in a room with a man called Curtis. He 
crashed into the room with a wild look in his  

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:32,640
eyes. He wasn't very tall, but he was very 
strong. 'Where are you from?' he asked.

74
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
'Mobile,' I told him.

75
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
'That's a stupid town!' he said.

76
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
And that was all of our 
conversation for several days.

77
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,120
On the practice field, things didn't 
start very well. I got the ball,  

78
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,000
but I ran the wrong way with it, and everybody 
got angry and started shouting at me.

79
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:09,440
But Coach Bryant called me across. 'Just get in 
the line and start catching the ball,' he told me.

80
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,800
And then I told him something 
that he didn't want to hear.

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
'They never taught me to catch 
a ball at high school,' I said.  

82
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,120
'It was difficult enough for me just 
to remember where our goal line was.'

83
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,640
I don't think he was very pleased. 
But he started to teach me to catch.

84
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,480
I wanted my Mom, and I wanted to 
go home. I didn't like that place.

85
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,640
And Curtis was always angry, 
and I couldn't understand him.  

86
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,320
He had a car, and sometimes he gave 
me a ride to the practice field.  

87
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,720
But one day when he had to change 
a wheel on the car, I helped him.

88
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,920
'If you're an idiot,' he said, angrily, 
'how do you know how to do that?'

89
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,640
'Maybe I am an idiot,' I 
said, 'but I'm not stupid.'

90
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,920
Then Curtis ran after me, and called 
me all kinds of terrible names.

91
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
After that, I moved my bed to another room.

92
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
***

93
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
The first football game was on Saturday.  

94
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,320
I ran well, and we won 35 to 3. Everybody was 
pleased with me. I phoned Mom to tell her.

95
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,840
'I heard the game on the radio!' she 
said. 'I was so happy, I wanted to cry!'

96
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,920
That night, everybody went to 
parties, but nobody asked me to go.  

97
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
I went back to my room, but I heard 
music from somewhere upstairs.  

98
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,280
I found a young man who was sitting 
in his room playing the harmonica.

99
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:27,680
His name was Bubba. He broke his foot in football 
practice and couldn't play in the game. I sat  

100
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,560
and listened to him. We didn't talk, 
but after about an hour, I asked,  

101
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:44,720
'Can I try it?' and he said 'OK', and 
gave me the harmonica. I began to play.

102
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,480
After several minutes, Bubba was getting 
really excited and saying, 'Good, good, good!'  

103
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,560
Then he asked, 'Where did 
you learn to play like that?'

104
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,840
'I didn't learn anywhere,' I said.

105
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,200
When it got late, he told me 
to take the harmonica with me,  

106
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,120
and I played it for a long time in my room.

107
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,840
Next day I took it back to Bubba.

108
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,400
'Keep it,' he said. 'I've got another one.'

109
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,840
I was really happy, and I went and 
sat under a tree and played all day.

110
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,040
It was late afternoon when I 
began to walk back to my room.  

111
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Suddenly, I heard a voice shout, 
'Forrest!' I turned round - and saw Jenny!

112
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,360
She had a big smile on her 
face, and she held my hand.

113
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,760
'I saw you play football yesterday,' 
she said. 'You were wonderful!'

114
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,440
She wasn't angry about the cinema, and 
she asked me to have a drink with her!

115
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:22,080
'I'm taking lessons in music, and I want to 
be a singer,' she told me. 'I play in a little  

116
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:29,840
group. We're playing at the Students' Centre 
tomorrow night. Why don't you come and listen?'

117
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
'OK,' I said.
 
 
 

118
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,440
CHAPTER THREE

119
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,280
The Big Game
 

120
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:51,440
On Friday night, I went to the Students' Centre. 
There were a lot of people there, and Jenny was  

121
00:14:51,440 --> 00:15:00,080
wearing a long dress and singing. Three or four 
other people were in the group with her, and they  

122
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:11,840
made a good sound. Jenny saw me and smiled, and I 
sat on the floor and listened. It was wonderful.

123
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:20,640
They played for about an hour, and I was lying 
back with my eyes closed, listening happily.  

124
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:31,280
How did it happen? I'm not sure. But suddenly I 
found that I was playing my harmonica with them!

125
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,040
Jenny stopped singing for a second or two, and 
the others in the group stopped playing. Then  

126
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:50,640
Jenny laughed and began to sing with my harmonica, 
and then everybody was saying 'Wonderful!' to me.

127
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Jenny came to see me. 'Forrest, where 
did you learn to play that thing?'

128
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,120
'I didn't learn anywhere,' I told her.

129
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,640
Well, after that, Jenny asked me to 
play with their group every Friday,  

130
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,960
and paid me $25 every time!

131
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
***

132
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,880
The only other important thing that happened to me 
at the university was the Big Game at the Orange  

133
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:32,960
Bowl in Miami that year. It was an important 
game which Coach Bryant wanted us to win.

134
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:43,520
The game started, and the ball came to me. I took 
it - and ran straight into a group of big men  

135
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,840
on the other team! Crash! It 
was like that all afternoon.

136
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,520
When they were winning 28 to 7, 
Coach Bryant called me across.  

137
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:06,320
'Forrest,' he said, 'all year we have 
secretly taught you to catch the ball  

138
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,400
and run with it. Now you're going 
to run like a wild animal. OK?'

139
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,840
'OK, Coach,' I said.

140
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,640
And I did. Everybody was surprised 
to see that I could catch the ball.  

141
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:37,200
Suddenly it was 28 to 14! And after I caught 
it four or five more times, it was 28 to 21.  

142
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Then the other team got two men to run after me. 
But that meant Gwinn was free to catch the ball,  

143
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:59,840
and he put us on the 15-yard line. Then Weasel, 
the kicker, got a field goal, and it was 28 to 24!

144
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,760
But then things began to go wrong again.  

145
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,840
Weasel made a bad mistake - and then the 
game finished, and we were the losers.

146
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Coach Bryant wasn't very happy. 'Well, 
boys,' he said, 'there's always next year.'

147
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
But not for me. I soon learned that.

148
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
***

149
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I couldn't stay at the university. I 
wasn't clever enough at the lessons,  

150
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,000
and there was nothing that anybody could 
do about it. Coach Bryant was very sad.

151
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,440
'I knew this would happen, Forrest,' 
he said. 'But I said to them.

152
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,480
"Just give me that boy in my team for a year!",  

153
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:09,840
and they did. And we had a good year - 
the best year, Forrest! Good luck, boy!'

154
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Bubba helped me to put my things in my suitcase, 
then he walked to the bus with me to say goodbye.  

155
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,680
We went past the Students' Centre. But it wasn't 
Friday night, and Jenny's band wasn't playing.  

156
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,480
I didn't know where she was.

157
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
It was late when the bus got to Mobile.  

158
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,120
Mom knew that I was coming, but 
she was crying when I got home.

159
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,320
'What's wrong?' I asked.

160
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,640
'A letter came,' she cried. 
'You've got to go in the army!'
 
 
 

161
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,680
CHAPTER FOUR

162
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,920
Vietnam
 

163
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:13,200
After I left the idiot school, people were always 
shouting at me - Coach Fellers, Coach Bryant,  

164
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,800
and then the people in the army.  

165
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:26,560
But I have to say this: the people in the 
army shouted louder and longer than anybody!

166
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,920
Fort Benning was in Georgia. After 
about a hundred hours on a bus,  

167
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:44,080
me and a lot of other new young soldiers 
arrived there. The place where I had to  

168
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:53,840
live was just a bit better than the rooms at the 
university, but the food was not. It was terrible.

169
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:04,960
Then, and in the months to come, I just had to do 
the things that I was told to do. They taught me  

170
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,920
how to shoot guns, throw hand grenades, 
and move along the ground on my stomach.

171
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:22,240
One day, the cook was ill, and somebody said, 
'Gump, you're going to be the cook today.'

172
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
'What am I going to cook?' 
I said. 'How do I cook?'

173
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,680
'It's easy,' said one of the men. 
'Just put everything that you see  

174
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,520
in the food cupboard into a big pot and cook it.'

175
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,240
'Maybe it won't taste very good,' I said.

176
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,320
'Nothing does in this place!' 
he said. He was right.

177
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:01,120
Well, I got tins of tomatoes, some rice, apples, 
potatoes, and everything that I could find.  

178
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
'What am I going to cook it 
in?' I asked one of the men.

179
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,560
There are some pots in the cupboard,' 
he said. But the pots were only small.

180
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
'You've got to find something,' 
one of the other men said.

181
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,160
'What about this?' I asked.  

182
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,560
There was a big metal thing about six feet tall 
and five feet round, sitting in the corner.

183
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,920
'That's the boiler. You 
can't cook anything in that.'

184
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
'Why not?' I asked. 'It's 
hot. It's got water in it.'

185
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,200
But the men had other things to 
do. 'Do what you like,' they said.

186
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,520
So I used the boiler.

187
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,960
I put everything in it, and after about an hour 
you could smell the cooking. It smelled OK.  

188
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,360
Then the men came back and everybody 
was waiting for their dinner.

189
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,520
'Hurry up with that food, Gump! 
We're hungry!' they shouted.

190
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,000
Suddenly, the boiler began to shake 
and make noises - and then it blew up!

191
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,000
It blew the food all over us - me, and all 
the men who were sitting at the tables.

192
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
'Gump!' they screamed. 'You're an idiot!'

193
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,080
But I already knew that.

194
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
***

195
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:53,120
After a year, we went to Vietnam to fight 
in the war. One evening we went to have a  

196
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:01,760
shower. The 'showers' were just a long hole in 
the ground for us to stand in, while somebody  

197
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,040
threw water over us. We were standing in 
it, when suddenly there was a strange noise.

198
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Then the ground began to blow up all round us!

199
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,440
We threw ourselves on to the floor of the 
shower hole, and somebody started screaming.  

200
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:32,240
It was some of our men on the far side of the 
hole, and there was blood all over them. Then  

201
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:40,240
everything went quiet again, and after a minute 
or two the rest of us climbed up out of the hole.

202
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,960
The enemy soldiers tried to blow us up 
for the next five nights, then it stopped.  

203
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,600
But it was time for us to move up north to 
help some of our other men in the jungle.

204
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:04,400
We went in helicopters, and there was smoke 
coming up out of the jungle when we got there.  

205
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,400
The enemy started shooting at 
us before we got on the ground,  

206
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,720
and they blew up one of our helicopters. 
It was terrible! People on fire,  

207
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:28,160
and nothing that we could do. It was almost night 
before we found our other soldiers in the jungle.

208
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,520
And who do you think one 
of them was? It was Bubba!

209
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:44,560
Well, in between the shooting, Bubba told me about 
himself. His foot got too bad to play football,  

210
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
and he had to leave the university.  

211
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
But his foot wasn't too bad for the 
army to get him - and here he was.

212
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,920
'What happened to Jenny Curran?' I asked.

213
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:10,160
'She left school and went off with a group of 
people who were against the war,' he said.
 
 
 

214
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,960
CHAPTER FIVE

215
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,520
Danger in the Jungle
 

216
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,120
There was a little valley between two hills. We 
were on one hill and the enemy was on the other.  

217
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Then we got orders to move the machine gun about 
fifty metres to the left of the big tree that was  

218
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,080
in the middle of the valley, and to find a safe 
place to put it before the enemy blew us all up.

219
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:52,560
We found a place to put the gun and stayed there 
all night. We could hear shooting all round us,  

220
00:26:52,560 --> 00:27:02,000
but they didn't hit us. When it was day again, our 
planes came, and they blew up the enemy soldiers.  

221
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,080
Then we watched while our men moved off 
the hill and came down into the valley.

222
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,960
Suddenly, somebody started shooting at 
them! We couldn't see the enemy soldiers  

223
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,400
because the jungle was too thick, 
but somebody was shooting at our men.

224
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:34,240
The shooting was in front of us, which meant 
that the enemy soldiers were in between us and  

225
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:44,080
our men. And this meant that the enemy was able to 
come back and find us, so we had to get out fast.

226
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,160
We began to move back to the hill,  

227
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,120
but Doyle suddenly saw more enemy 
soldiers who were going towards our men!  

228
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:06,160
We waited until they got to the top, then Bones 
began shooting with the machine gun. He probably  

229
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:16,960
killed ten or fifteen enemy soldiers. Doyle and I 
and the other two men threw grenades, but then an  

230
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:25,120
enemy soldier shot Bones in the head. I pulled the 
machine gun from his hands, and shouted to Doyle.

231
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,840
There was no answer.

232
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,320
Two of them were dead, and 
Doyle was only just alive.

233
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,000
I picked up Doyle and put him across my shoulders,  

234
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:50,560
then I ran towards the hill. There were bullets 
flying all round me from behind - and then I saw  

235
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:57,840
more enemy soldiers in the low grass in front of 
me! They were shooting at our men on the hill.

236
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I ran fast, shouting and screaming as loudly 
as I could. And suddenly I was in the middle  

237
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,560
of our soldiers, and everybody was 
pleased and hitting me on the back!  

238
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,760
My shouting and screaming frightened 
the enemy soldiers away. They just ran!

239
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
***

240
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,840
The weeks went past slowly.  

241
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:35,840
I got a letter from my Mom, and I wrote back to 
her that everything was OK. I also wrote a letter  

242
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,680
to Jenny Curran and asked Mom to ask her parents 
to send it on to her. But I didn't get a reply.

243
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,680
Bubba and I decided that we would get 
a shrimp boat when we got home again,  

244
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,000
and catch shrimps, and make a lot 
of money. Bubba planned it all.

245
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,440
It started to rain one day, and it didn't stop 
for two months! But we still had to look for enemy  

246
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:18,880
soldiers - and one day we found them. We were 
crossing a rice field when suddenly they started  

247
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:29,120
shooting at us. Somebody shouted, 'Back!' I picked 
up my machine gun and ran towards some trees.

248
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,880
I looked round for Bubba, but he wasn't there. 
Then I heard that he was out in the rice field,  

249
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:47,120
and he was hurt, so I left my gun by 
the trees and ran back into the field.  

250
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,520
'Gump! You can't go out there!' 
somebody shouted. But I just ran.

251
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:05,200
Halfway out, I saw another man who was 
hurt. He was holding a hand up to me - so  

252
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,560
I picked him up and ran back to the trees with 
him. Then I ran out again and found Bubba.  

253
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,520
There was blood all over him and 
he had two bullets in his stomach.

254
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,760
He looked up at me, and said, 
'Forrest, why did this happen?'  

255
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,680
What could I say? Then he said, 'Play 
me a song on the harmonica, will you?'

256
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,720
There was still a lot of shooting 
going on, but I played a song. Then  

257
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:55,200
all the colour went out of Bubba's face 
and he said something very softly: 'Home.'

258
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,840
And then he died.

259
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
And that's all I've got to say about that.

260
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
***

261
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,880
The rest of the night was terrible. The worst 
night that I've ever known. Nobody could get  

262
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,760
any help to us, and the enemy soldiers were 
so near that we could hear them talking.  

263
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,080
Then, when it got light, an American plane came  

264
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,440
and used fire-throwers on the 
enemy - and almost on us! Suddenly  

265
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:42,080
the trees were on fire, and men were running 
out of the jungle with burned skin and clothes.

266
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,520
During all of this, somebody shot me in the back 
of the leg, but I can't remember when it happened.  

267
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,080
It didn't matter. Nothing mattered.  

268
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:03,120
Bubba was dead, the shrimp business idea was 
dead with him. I just wanted to die, too.

269
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,120
Then our helicopters came, and the 
enemy soldiers who were left ran away.

270
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,040
An hour later, I was out of there and 
on my way to the hospital in Danang.
 
 
 

271
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,240
CHAPTER SIX

272
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,320
The White House
 

273
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:38,240
I was at the hospital for two months. After 
the first few weeks my leg was getting better,  

274
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:45,680
and one day I went down into the little town, 
to the fish market. I bought some shrimps,  

275
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,960
and one of the cooks at the hospital 
cooked them for me. Two days later,  

276
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,880
I went back to the fish market and 
talked to a man who was selling shrimps.

277
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,960
'Where do you get them?' I asked him.

278
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,240
He immediately started talking fast in 
a language that I couldn't understand,  

279
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,480
but he took me somewhere - past 
all the boats and the beach.  

280
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,640
There he took a net and put it in the water. When 
he took it out again, it was full of shrimps!

281
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:36,160
Every day for the next few weeks, I went 
with Mr Chi (that was his name) and watched  

282
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,200
him while he worked. He showed me 
how to catch shrimps with the net,  

283
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,920
and it was so easy that an 
idiot was able to do it!

284
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,840
Which I did!

285
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,880
Then one day I got back to the 
hospital and a Colonel Gooch said,  

286
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,920
'Gump, we're going back to America together! 
You're going to see the President of the United  

287
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,760
States, and he's going to give you a 
medal because you were very brave.'

288
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
***

289
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,200
There were about two thousand people waiting for 
us at San Francisco airport when we got off the  

290
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:32,160
plane! What a surprise! A lot of them had beards 
and long hair. I thought perhaps they were there  

291
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:41,920
to welcome us, but I was wrong. They were shouting 
unpleasant things, and then somebody threw  

292
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:50,400
a tomato at Colonel Gooch and it hit him in the 
face. He tried to clean it off and not look angry,  

293
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,960
but I didn't want to wait for them to start 
throwing things at me! No sir! I started running.

294
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,600
The people ran after me - all two thousand 
of them! - but they couldn't catch me.  

295
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,840
I ran all round the airport, and then I 
ran into a toilet and locked the door.  

296
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,800
I waited in there for almost an 
hour before I came out again.

297
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,640
I went to look for Colonel Gooch, and I found 
him in the middle of a group of policemen.  

298
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,960
He was looking very worried until he saw me.

299
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,400
'Come on, Gump!' he said. 'The plane 
for Washington is waiting for us.'

300
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,720
The army sent a car to meet us at Washington 
airport, and we drove to a really nice hotel.  

301
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,040
After we put our suitcases in our rooms,  

302
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,080
the Colonel asked me to go out 
to a bar with him for a drink.

303
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:07,840
'People are different here,' he told me. 
'They aren't like the people in California.'

304
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,920
He was wrong.

305
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:20,160
When we got there, he bought me a beer, and he was 
telling me about the President and my medal when  

306
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,240
something happened. A pretty girl came up to our 
table, and the Colonel thought she was a waitress.

307
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,120
'Get us two more drinks, please,' he said.

308
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,640
She looked at him and said,  

309
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,520
'I won't get you anything - not as 
much as a glass of warm river-water,  

310
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:55,120
you pig!' Then she looked at me and said, 'And how 
many babies have you killed today, you big ape?'

311
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,200
Well, after that we went back to the hotel.

312
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
***

313
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,760
Next morning we got up early 
and went to the White House,  

314
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,920
where the President lives. It's a 
really pretty house with a big garden.

315
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,440
A lot of army people were there, and 
they immediately started shaking my hand  

316
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,840
and telling me that I was a brave man 
and that they were pleased to meet me.

317
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,760
The President was a great big old man 
who talked like somebody from Texas,  

318
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,800
and there were a lot of people standing 
round him in the flower garden.

319
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,840
Then an army man started to read something, 
and everybody listened. Everybody but me,  

320
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:58,320
because I was hungry and wanted some breakfast. 
At last the army man finished reading,  

321
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:06,720
and then the President came up and gave me the 
medal. After that, he began to shake my hand.

322
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,800
I was just thinking of getting out 
of there and having some breakfast  

323
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,440
when the President said, 'Boy, is 
that your stomach making that noise?'  

324
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:31,920
So I said, 'Yes,' and the President said, 'Well, 
come on, boy, let's go and get something to eat!'  

325
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
And I followed him into the house, 
and a waiter got us some breakfast.

326
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,720
The President asked me a lot of questions 
about Vietnam and the army, but I just said,  

327
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:56,480
'Yes, it's OK' or shook my head to say no, and 
after several minutes of this we were both silent.

328
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,520
'Do you want to watch TV?' 
the President asked suddenly.

329
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,440
So me and the President of America 
watched TV while I ate my breakfast!

330
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,920
Later, when we were back in the garden, 
the President said, 'You were hurt,  

331
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,000
weren't you, boy? Well, look at this...' 
And he pulled up his shirt and showed me  

332
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,800
the place on his stomach where he was hurt 
once. 'Where were you hurt?' he asked me.

333
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,560
So I pulled down my trousers, 
turned round and showed him.

334
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,880
Well, lots of newspaper men started taking  

335
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,320
photographs before Colonel Gooch 
could run across and pull me away!

336
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,240
That afternoon, back at the hotel, he 
came to my room shouting and throwing  

337
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,840
newspapers on to the bed. And there I was, 
on the front page, with my trousers down!

338
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,120
'Gump, you idiot!' shouted Colonel Gooch.

339
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,840
'Yes, sir,' I said. 'That's what I am. 
But I just try to do the right thing.'
 
 
 

340
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,920
CHAPTER SEVEN

341
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,080
Meeting Jenny Again
 

342
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,400
Soon after that, I heard that 
I was leaving the army early,  

343
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,360
and they gave me some money 
for a train ticket to go home.

344
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:54,320
But all this time, I was thinking about Jenny 
Curran. Just before I left the hospital in Danang,  

345
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,240
I had a letter from her. She was now 
playing in a group called The Broken Eggs,  

346
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:11,440
and they played two nights each week at a place 
called the Hodaddy Club near Harvard University.  

347
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,720
Now that I was free from the army, 
I just wanted to go and see her.  

348
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,320
So I got a ticket for Boston, instead of Mobile.

349
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:37,120
I tried to walk to the Hodaddy Club from the train 
station, but I lost my way, so I took a taxi. It  

350
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:45,840
was in the afternoon, and the man behind the 
bar said, Jenny'll be here about nine o'clock.'

351
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
'Can I wait?' I asked.

352
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,520
'OK,' he said.

353
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,840
So I sat down and waited for five or six hours.

354
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,960
Students began to come in, most of them wearing 
dirty jeans. The men had beards, and the women  

355
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:19,200
had long, untidy hair. Later, the group - The 
Broken Eggs - arrived, but I didn't see Jenny.  

356
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:29,040
Then they began to play - and they were loud. The 
music sounded like a plane that was taking off!  

357
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,200
But the students loved it.

358
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,040
And then Jenny came on!

359
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,080
She was different. Her hair 
was all the way down her back,  

360
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:52,080
and she was wearing sun-glasses - at night! 
She was wearing blue jeans and a shirt with  

361
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:59,040
lots of colours on it. The group started 
playing again and Jenny began to sing.

362
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,840
Later, I went outside and walked round 
for about half an hour, then went back.  

363
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,000
There were a lot of people waiting to go 
in, so I went round to the back of the place  

364
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,640
and sat on the ground. I had my harmonica in my 
pocket, so I took it out and started to play.

365
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,520
I could hear the music that was playing 
inside and, after a minute or two,  

366
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:40,640
I began playing with it. Suddenly, a door 
behind me opened - and there was Jenny!

367
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:50,960
'Who is that playing the harmonica?' 
she said. And then she saw me. 'Forrest  

368
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,560
Gump!' And she ran out of the 
door and threw her arms round me.

369
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
***

370
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,920
We talked together until it 
was time for her to sing again.

371
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,280
'I didn't leave school,' said Jenny. 'They 
threw me out after they found a boy in my room  

372
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:21,040
one night. I went to California and stayed 
there for some time.' She laughed. 'I wore  

373
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,480
flowers in my hair, and talked about love. 
But the people that I was with were strange.  

374
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:39,520
Then I met a man, and we came to Boston. But he 
was dangerous. He was against the war, like me,  

375
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:49,120
but he blew up buildings and things. I couldn't 
stay with him. Next, I met a teacher from Harvard  

376
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,080
University, but he was married. Then 
I began to sing with The Broken Eggs.'

377
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,840
'Where do you live?' I asked.

378
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,160
'With my boyfriend,' she said. 'He's a student. 
You can come back and stay with us tonight.'

379
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:18,160
The boyfriend's name was Rudolph. He was a 
little man, and he was sitting on the floor  

380
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,280
with his eyes shut when we got to Jenny's flat.

381
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,800
'Rudolph, this is Forrest,' Jenny said.  

382
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,120
'He's a friend of mine from home, and he's 
going to stay with us for a few days.'

383
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:41,840
Rudolph didn't speak or open his eyes, 
but he put up his hand and smiled.

384
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,840
Next morning, when I got up, Rudolph was 
still sitting on the floor with his eyes shut.

385
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,320
That afternoon, Jenny took me to 
meet the other people in the group,  

386
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:05,040
and that night I began playing my harmonica 
with them at the Hodaddy Club. It went well,  

387
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,840
and I played with them every night after that.

388
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,160
Then one day I came back to the flat 
and Jenny was sitting on the floor.

389
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,360
'Where's Rudolph?' I asked.

390
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:29,440
'Gone,' she said. 'Walked out, like all 
the others.' And then she started to cry.

391
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,520
'Don't cry, Jenny,' I said. 
And I put my arm round her.

392
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:44,480
Well, it started like that. But the next 
minute we were kissing and making love!  

393
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,520
And when we finished, Jenny said, 'Forrest, 
where have you been all this time?'
 
 
 

394
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,560
CHAPTER EIGHT

395
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,640
Into Space
 

396
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,120
Spring and summer went by, and I continued 
to play my harmonica with the group.  

397
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,600
It was my happiest time of all. But - 
you've guessed it - something went wrong.

398
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,800
How did it happen? I don't know. But one 
night I was sitting outside the Hodaddy Club,  

399
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:35,200
smoking a cigarette, when a girl smiled and 
came up to me. She sat down across my legs  

400
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:43,520
and put her arms round me. She was laughing 
and kissing me, and I didn't know what to do.

401
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,920
Suddenly, the door opened 
behind me, and there was Jenny.

402
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,680
'Forrest, it's time to -' She stopped 
when she saw me with the girl.  

403
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,680
Then she said, 'Oh, no! Not you, too!'

404
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,160
I jumped up and pushed the 
girl away. 'Jenny!' I said.

405
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,400
'Stay away from me, Forrest!' she said. 'You 
men are all the same! Just stay away from me!'

406
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,800
She didn't speak to me again that night.  

407
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,000
And the next morning she told me 
to find another place to live.

408
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:37,440
I went to live with Moses, one of the other 
men in the group, and soon after that Jenny  

409
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,400
went to Washington to talk and work against 
the war. Moses wrote down the address for me.

410
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,400
So I went back to Washington, too.

411
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,720
There was a lot of trouble 
there. Police were everywhere,  

412
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,840
and people were shouting and throwing things.

413
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,960
And the police were taking some of them away.

414
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,200
I went to find Jenny's address, 
but there was nobody at home.  

415
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,480
I waited outside for most of the 
day. Then, at about nine o'clock,  

416
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,360
a car stopped near the house and some 
people got out. And there she was!

417
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,160
I started to walk towards her, but she  

418
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:33,520
turned and walked away. The other people - 
two men and a girl - didn't know what to say.

419
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,160
'What's wrong with her?' I 
asked one of the two men.

420
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:46,640
'She just got out of prison,' he said. 'She was 
there all night before we could get her out.'

421
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:57,600
Jenny was in the back of the car now, so I went 
over and talked to her through the window. I told  

422
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:04,640
her how I felt - I was sorry about the girl, and 
I didn't want to play in the group without her.  

423
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:13,120
She listened quietly, then opened the car 
door for me to get in, and we sat and talked.

424
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,680
The others were talking about something that 
would happen the next day. Some American soldiers  

425
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,760
planned to take off their Vietnam medals and 
throw them away in front of the crowds of people.

426
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,160
Suddenly Jenny said, 'Did you 
know that Forrest won a medal?'

427
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,640
The others went quiet and looked 
at me, then looked at Jenny.

428
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
***

429
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,960
Next morning,  

430
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,800
Jenny came into the living-room. I was sleeping 
on the floor of their house. She woke me up.

431
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,440
'Forrest,' she said. 'I want 
you to do something for me.'

432
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,080
'What?' I said.

433
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,800
I want you to come with us today, and 
I want you to wear your army clothes.'

434
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,760
'Why?' I asked.

435
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,000
'Because you're going to do something 
to stop all the killing in Vietnam.'

436
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,640
You can guess what I had to do, can't you?  

437
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:29,120
I had to throw away my medal with the other 
American soldiers. But because my medal was  

438
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,560
a more famous medal than theirs, it was 
more important to Jenny and her friends.

439
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:44,480
But it got me into more trouble. Oh, I threw 
my medal away, OK - but it hit somebody really  

440
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,640
important! One of the President's 
men! So they threw me into prison.

441
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
Why do things like that always happen to me?

442
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
***

443
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:04,640
As it happened, I didn't stay in prison long, 
because they soon realized that I was an idiot,  

444
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:12,800
and they put me in a special hospital for 
idiots. It was the doctors at the hospital  

445
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,520
who decided to send me to NASA - that's 
the space centre at Houston, in Texas.

446
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,000
'You're just the kind of person that 
they're looking for!' the doctors told me.

447
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,200
I soon understood why!  

448
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:41,840
NASA sent me on a journey into space with a woman 
and an ape! Me, a spaceman! It was very strange.

449
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,320
All kinds of things went wrong because 
of that ape. Instead of coming down  

450
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,920
in the sea when we returned, the space 
ship came down in the jungle somewhere,  

451
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:02,640
and it was four years before the NASA people found 
us! But the ape and I were soon good friends.  

452
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:12,080
His name was Sue (yes, I know it's a girl's 
name, but they sent a male ape up by mistake,  

453
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:20,000
and NASA didn't like to tell the newspapers 
that). And it was in the jungle that I met Big  

454
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,280
Sam - a man who taught me to play chess. And 
that was important, as you will see later.
 
 
 

455
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,320
CHAPTER NINE

456
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,480
A Real Idiot
 

457
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,520
Of course, the first thing that I 
wanted to do when I got back to America  

458
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,760
was find Jenny. So I phoned Moses in Boston.

459
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,840
'The Broken Eggs group has broken up,' he told me.  

460
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:02,960
'I don't know what happened to Jenny. I heard that 
she went to Chicago, but that was five years ago.'

461
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,480
'Do you have a telephone 
number, or anything?' I asked.

462
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,120
'It's an old number,' he said, 
'but perhaps she's still there.'

463
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,840
I phoned the number, and she wasn't.

464
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:30,800
'Jenny Curran?' a man's voice said. 'She went to 
Indianapolis. Got a job at the Temperer factory.'

465
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,760
So I went to Indianapolis on the bus.

466
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
***

467
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:45,680
The Temperer factory was outside the town. I asked 
about Jenny at the office, and the woman said,  

468
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:54,400
'Yes, she works in here. Why don't you wait at 
the side of the factory? It's almost lunch-time,  

469
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,160
and she'll probably come out.' So I did.

470
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:08,720
A lot of people came out at lunch-time. Then Jenny 
came out. She went and sat under a tree on the  

471
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:17,840
grass, and began eating an apple. I went up behind 
her and said, 'That looks like a nice apple.'  

472
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,840
She didn't look up. She just 
said, 'Forrest, it has to be you.'

473
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:35,520
A minute later, I had my arms round her and we 
were both crying. People were watching us with  

474
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:43,840
strange looks on their faces, but it didn't 
matter. Jenny and me were together again.

475
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:51,280
'I finish work in three hours, Forrest,' 
Jenny said. 'Why don't you wait for me  

476
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,280
in that bar across the street? 
Then I'll take you to my place.'

477
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,880
So I waited in the bar.

478
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,320
And I got into the wrestling 
business. How? I'll tell you.

479
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,960
It started when I arm-wrestled a man in the bar,  

480
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:20,800
and won some money on a bet. That gave me an 
idea. But at first I didn't say anything to Jenny.

481
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,520
She came across to the bar after 
work, and we had a drink and talked.

482
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,560
'I saw you on TV when you went up 
into space, Forrest,' she said.

483
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,880
And I told her all about 
that, and about Sue, the ape.

484
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,960
'What happened to him?' she asked.

485
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,480
'I don't know,' I said. 
'But he was a good friend.'

486
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Later, we went back to Jenny's flat, 
and she said, 'You can stay here.'

487
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:08,080
Next day, when Jenny went to work, I 
went back to the bar. Several people  

488
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:14,800
wanted to try arm-wrestling with me 
again, and I said OK. None of them won  

489
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,840
because I was too strong, but plenty 
of people wanted to try their luck.

490
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,920
After about a month, I was winning 
nearly two hundred dollars a week,  

491
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:35,840
arm-wrestling. Then one day a man 
called Mike came into the bar.

492
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,200
'You can make a lot more money,' he told me.

493
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,080
'How?' I asked.

494
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,840
'Wrestling. Real wrestling,' 
he said. 'I can teach you.'

495
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,160
To make a long story short - he did.

496
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,720
Jenny wasn't happy about the wrestling but I won 
a lot of money - sometimes by winning fights,  

497
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:12,560
sometimes by losing them because Mike told me 
to lose them. Yes, that happens, too. But then  

498
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:20,480
I did something stupid again. I bet on myself 
winning a fight, after Mike told me to lose it.

499
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,120
Jenny got really angry. 'It 
isn't honest,' she said.

500
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,840
I didn't listen. I bet all my money on 
myself to win - and then I lost the fight.

501
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,520
But there was worse to come. When I 
got back to the flat, Jenny was gone,  

502
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,240
and there was a letter waiting for me. It said:
 
 

503
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,560
Dear Forrest

504
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:58,320
You're doing something bad tonight. It isn't 
honest, and I cannot go on with you like this.  

505
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:07,280
I think about having a house and a family and 
things like that now. I watched you grow up  

506
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:14,960
big and strong and good. And then, in 
Boston, I realized that I loved you,  

507
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:22,640
and I was the happiest girl in the world. But 
then there was that girl outside the Hodaddy Club.  

508
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:31,840
Then you went up into space and I lost you for 
four years, and I think you changed. And I think  

509
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:40,360
perhaps I changed, too. I just want to live in 
an ordinary way now. So, I must go and find it.

510
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:45,680
I am crying while I write this, 
but please don't try to find me.

511
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,720
Goodbye, my dear. love, Jenny
 
 

512
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,800
And for the first time ever, I 
knew that I was a real idiot.
 
 
 

513
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,920
CHAPTER TEN

514
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,880
Money for Playing Games
 

515
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:15,120
I decided to go home to Mobile, but 
the bus stopped at Nashville on the way  

516
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,000
and I went into town for a 
drink and something to eat.  

517
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:29,520
I was going past a hotel when I looked in the 
window and saw some people who were playing chess.  

518
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:37,840
Like I said before, Big Sam taught me how 
to play chess when I was in the jungle.  

519
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I went into the hotel to watch them, 
but it was a special chess tournament  

520
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:52,320
and it cost five dollars to watch, 
so I didn't go into the chess room.

521
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:01,040
I was just walking out again when I saw a 
little old man who was playing chess with  

522
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:09,120
himself at a table near the door. I had another 
hour before I had to catch the bus again,  

523
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:19,840
so I went across and watched him. Then I said, 
'If you make that move, you'll lose your queen.'

524
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:28,480
He didn't look up but, after a minute, 
he said, 'Perhaps you're right.'

525
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,480
It was time for me to get back to the 
bus station, but when I started to leave,  

526
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:43,200
the old man said, 'Why don't you sit 
down and finish this game with me?'

527
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,800
'I can't,' I said. 'I have to catch a bus.'

528
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,280
So he waved at me with his hand, 
and I went back to the bus station.

529
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:04,240
But I missed the bus that evening, and there 
wasn't another one until the next day. So  

530
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:11,360
I walked back to the hotel, and there was the 
little old man, still playing against himself.  

531
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,640
He looked up and saw me, and told me to sit down.

532
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,960
It took me an hour to win that chess game.

533
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,880
'Just who are you?' he said after the game.

534
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,880
'Forrest Gump,' I said.

535
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,080
'Where did you learn to play chess?' he asked.

536
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,760
'In the jungle,' I told him.

537
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:46,160
He looked surprised. 'Aren't you 
in the tournament?' he asked.

538
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,600
'No,' I told him. 'I'm going home, and 
I'm going to start a shrimp business.'

539
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,920
'You can make a lot of money from 
chess,' he said. 'You're very good.'

540
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,040
'Am I?' I said.

541
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,880
The old man's name was Mr Tribble. Two days later  

542
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,200
we were on our way to Los Angeles, 
to a big chess tournament.

543
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,960
***

544
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,760
We were a day or two early for 
the tournament, and Mr Tribble  

545
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:28,800
took me to see some people who were making a 
film. They make a lot of films in Los Angeles.  

546
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,360
We were watching a man who was crashing 
through a window in a film fight,  

547
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:45,600
when a man walked over to us. 'Are you an 
actor?' he asked me. 'Who, me?' I said.

548
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,840
'We're here for the chess tournament,' said Mr 
Tribble. But the other man was looking at me.  

549
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,200
'You are a big, strong man, aren't you?'  

550
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:08,080
he said. 'You're just what I need for a 
film that I'm making. My name is Felder.'

551
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:13,120
'He has to play chess in a tournament 
tomorrow,' said Mr Tribble.  

552
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:22,000
'He hasn't got time to be an actor.' 
'It won't take long,' said Mr Felder.

553
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:29,360
So we went with Mr Felder, and I found myself 
acting in a film about the jungle - with  

554
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:38,320
Raquel Welch, the famous film star! 'Is that 
really Raquel Welch?' I asked Mr Felder.  

555
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:48,080
But things did not go well. Somehow, when I was 
helping Miss Welch to escape from the jungle,  

556
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,520
her dress came off and I had to 
run into the trees to hide her.  

557
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:01,840
But who do you think we met there? 
Sue, the ape! He was in another film!

558
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:09,600
The three of us ran out of there fast, 
and Miss Welch shouted and screamed.

559
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,680
No, things didn't go very well.  

560
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:21,440
I wasn't an actor for very long. I 
think Mr Tribble was secretly pleased.

561
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,680
I was pleased because I was back with Sue again.

562
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
***

563
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:34,320
Back at our hotel, the three of us sat in 
our room and tried to decide what to do.

564
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,120
'It's going to be difficult travelling 
with an ape,' said Mr Tribble.

565
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,840
'He won't be any trouble, Mr Tribble,' I said.

566
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,320
But Mr Tribble seemed worried.

567
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,760
Next day was the big chess tournament at 
the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr Tribble and I  

568
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,680
got there early, and I had to play chess all day.

569
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:11,760
It took me about seven minutes to win the first 
game, and half an hour to win the next. I played  

570
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:21,120
all that day, and the next. And suddenly I was in 
the final, playing with a Russian, Honest Ivan,  

571
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:30,880
the best player in the world. He was a big man, 
with long black hair, and he didn't want to lose!

572
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:40,640
It was a long game. Honest Ivan was 
good - very good. But just when Honest  

573
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:47,840
Ivan seemed to be winning, Sue ran across 
the room and jumped onto the chess table!

574
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:55,840
Honest Ivan fell off his chair, and everybody 
started screaming and running everywhere.  

575
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,280
'Let's get out of here, 
Forrest!' shouted Mr Tribble.

576
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,480
We got back to the hotel 
and hurried up to our room.

577
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:16,080
'Forrest,' said Mr Tribble, 'You're a wonderful 
chess player, but I never know what's going  

578
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:24,080
to happen next! Here's half of the money that 
you've won - it's almost five thousand dollars.  

579
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,640
Take Sue back to Alabama with you, 
and start your shrimp business.'  

580
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:38,240
He shook my hand and gave me his address. 
'Write to me sometimes, Forrest. Good luck!'
 
 
 

581
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,360
CHAPTER ELEVEN

582
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,440
The Shrimp Business
 

583
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,840
Well, I finally went home to Mobile again.  

584
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:59,280
The train got into Mobile station about three 
o'clock in the morning, and Sue and I got off.  

585
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:06,160
We walked into the town and finally found 
a place to sleep in an empty building.

586
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,800
The next morning I bought some breakfast 
and got Sue some bananas to eat.  

587
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,920
Then we went to see Mom. 
She was pleased to see me.

588
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:24,480
'Oh, Forrest,' she said, 'you're home at last!'

589
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,520
'Yes, Mom,' I said.

590
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:37,120
But I didn't stay long. Two days later, 
Sue and I got the bus to Bayou La Batre,  

591
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,600
where Bubba's parents lived, 
and I explained to Bubba's daddy  

592
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:47,840
about the shrimp business that Bubba and I 
planned to start after we came out of the army.  

593
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:56,960
He listened, and he was very interested. 
And the next day he took Sue and me  

594
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,400
out in his little boat, to look for a 
good place to start the shrimp business.

595
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,240
It took almost a month to start 
things up - to get nets, and a boat,  

596
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:17,920
and everything. Finally the day came when 
Sue and I were ready to go shrimping.  

597
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:24,880
And by that night we had hundreds 
and hundreds of shrimps in our nets!

598
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:33,440
It was the beginning of my shrimp business. 
We worked hard, all that summer, and that  

599
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:40,800
autumn and winter and the next spring. 
And after a year, Mom was working for me,  

600
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:48,160
and Mr Tribble, and Curtis (my old 
football friend), and Bubba's daddy.

601
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:54,080
At the end of that year, we 
had thirty thousand dollars!

602
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:04,720
Everybody was very happy. But me? I was thinking 
of Jenny, of course. I wanted to find her again.  

603
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,960
And one day I dressed in my best clothes  

604
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,240
and got the bus to Mobile, and 
I went to Jenny's Mom's house.

605
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,480
'Forrest Gump!' she said, 
when she saw me. 'Come on in!'

606
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:32,960
Well, we talked about Mom and the shrimp business 
and everything. Then I asked about Jenny.

607
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:42,640
'I don't hear from her very often,' she said. 'I 
think they live somewhere in North Carolina now.'

608
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,600
'They?' I said.

609
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:53,840
Didn't you know?' she said. 
'Jenny married two years ago;

610
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,480
***

611
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,160
Why wasn't I ready for that 
news? I don't know, but I wasn't.  

612
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:07,840
And part of me seemed to die when I heard 
it. But Jenny only did what she had to do.  

613
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:16,160
Because I'm an idiot. A lot of people say 
that they married an idiot, but they don't  

614
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:23,200
know what it's like to marry a real one. 
I cried that night, but it didn't help.

615
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,800
'I'm just going to work hard,' I 
told myself. 'It's all I can do.'

616
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:41,008
And I did. And at the end of that year 
we had seventy-five thousand dollars.

617
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:41,440
***

618
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:50,240
Time went on. I looked in the mirror and 
saw lines on my face and grey in my hair.  

619
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,160
The business was doing well, but I asked myself,  

620
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:01,200
'What are you doing all this for?' 
And I knew that I had to get away.

621
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:10,400
Mr Tribble understood. 'Why don't you tell 
everybody that you're taking a long holiday,  

622
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:17,920
Forrest?' he said. 'The business 
will be here when you want it again.'

623
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,680
So I did. Sue came with me, 
and we went to the bus station.

624
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,680
'Where do you want to go?' the 
woman in the ticket office asked.

625
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,040
'I don't know,' I said.

626
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,880
'Why don't you go to Savannah?' 
she said. 'It's a nice town.'

627
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:45,920
'OK,' I said.
 
 
 

628
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,640
CHAPTER TWELVE

629
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:48,880
Little Forrest
 

630
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:59,360
Sue and I got off the bus at Savannah, then I 
went and got a cup of coffee and sat outside  

631
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:09,920
the bus station. What could I do next? I didn't 
know. So after I finished my cup of coffee, I  

632
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:19,200
took out my harmonica and began to play. I played 
two songs - and a man walked past and threw some  

633
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:27,840
money into my empty coffee cup! I played two more 
songs, and soon the cup was half full of money!

634
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:35,440
By the end of the next week, we were 
getting ten dollars a day. Then,  

635
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:42,000
one afternoon when I was playing to some 
people in the park, I noticed that a little  

636
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,200
boy was watching me carefully. Then I looked 
up and saw a woman who was standing near him.

637
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,080
It was Jenny Curran.

638
01:14:53,680 --> 01:15:00,800
Her hair was different, and she looked a bit 
older, and a bit tired, but it was her all right.  

639
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,600
And when I finished playing, she held 
the little boy's hand and came across.

640
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,720
She was smiling. 'Oh, Forrest, I knew it was you  

641
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:20,240
when I heard that harmonica. Nobody 
plays the harmonica like you do.'

642
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,720
'What are you doing here?' I asked her.

643
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,720
'We live here now,' she said.  

644
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,840
'Donald works in a business here in Savannah. 
We came here about three years ago.'

645
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,880
When I stopped playing, the 
rest of the people walked away.  

646
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,480
Jenny sat next to me while the 
little boy started playing with Sue.

647
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,240
'Why are you playing your harmonica in the park?'  

648
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:59,040
asked Jenny. 'Mom wrote and told me about 
your shrimp business, and how rich you were.'

649
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,840
'It's a long story,' I said. 
'Is that your little boy?'

650
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,720
'Yes,' she said.

651
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,760
'What do you call him?'

652
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:22,800
'His name is Forrest,' she said quietly. 
Then she went on, 'He's half yours.  

653
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,680
He's your son, Forrest.'

654
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:34,640
I looked at the boy, who was still 
playing with Sue. 'My... son?'

655
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:41,200
'I knew that a baby was on the 
way when I left Indianapolis,'  

656
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:51,800
said Jenny, 'but I didn't want to say anything. 
I don't know why. I was worried that perhaps -'

657
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,240
'Perhaps he would be an 
idiot,' I finished for her.

658
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:04,080
'Yes. But Forrest, he's not 
an idiot, he's really clever.'

659
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,120
'Are you sure that he's mine?' I asked.

660
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,840
'I'm sure,' said Jenny. 'He 
wants to be a football player.'

661
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,200
I looked at the boy. 'Can I 
see him for a minute or two?'

662
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,400
'Of course,' said Jenny, and 
she called to him. 'Forrest,  

663
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,400
I want you to meet another Forrest. 
He's an old friend of mine.'

664
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:44,800
The boy came and sat down. 'What a 
funny animal you've got,' he said.

665
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,840
'He's an ape,' I said. 'His name is Sue.'

666
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,000
'Why is it called Sue if it's a he?'

667
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,600
I knew then that I didn't have an idiot for a son.  

668
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,520
'Your Mom tells me that you 
want to be a football player.'

669
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,840
'Yes,' he said. 'Do you know 
anything about football?'

670
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,600
'A bit,' I said. 'But ask your 
daddy. He'll know more than me.'

671
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,960
He put his arms round me for a second, 
then went off to play with Sue again.

672
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,680
Jenny looked at me. 'How long 
have we been friends, Forrest?  

673
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:43,360
Thirty years? Sometimes it doesn't seem 
true.' She moved nearer, and gave me a kiss.  

674
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,680
'Idiots,' said Jenny. 'Who isn't an idiot?'

675
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:57,760
Then she got up and held little 
Forrest's hand, and they walked away.

676
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,920
***

677
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:08,080
Well, after that, I did a few 
things. First I phoned Mr Tribble and  

678
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:15,440
told him to give some of my money from the shrimp 
business to my Mom, and some to Bubba's daddy.

679
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,840
'Then send the rest to Jenny 
and little Forrest,' I said.

680
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:32,560
That night I sat up thinking. 'Perhaps I can put 
things right with Jenny,' I thought, 'now that  

681
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:40,720
I've found her again.' But the more I thought 
about it, the more I finally understood that it  

682
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:47,520
was better for the boy to be with Jenny and her 
husband, and not to have an idiot for a father.

683
01:19:49,040 --> 01:20:00,160
An idiot? Yes, I'm an idiot. But most of the 
time I just try to do the right thing.
 
 
 
 
 
 

684
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:00,779
- THE END -
