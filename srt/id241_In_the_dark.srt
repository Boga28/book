CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,320
A Shocking Confession

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,519
Maybe he was mad.

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,750
Maybe he had a sixth sense.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,730
Or was he really haunted?

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:28,650
I He told me the first part of the story,
and I saw the last part with my own eyes.

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,940
At school my friend Haldane and I hated a
boy called Visger.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,399
When we did something wrong, he always told
the teacher.

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,809
One day we stole some cherries from a tree.

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,719
'Do you know who did it, Visger?'

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,859
the teacher asked.

12
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,570
'It was Haldane and Winston,' he replied.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,160
Later, Haldane asked him how he knew it was
us.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,850
'I didn't know,' he said.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,030
'I just felt certain.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,010
And I was right.'

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,860
Haldane and I grew up.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,680
Visger became a vegetarian and never drank
alcohol.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,970
He also became Sir George Visger.

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,390
When we all left Oxford University, I went
away to India.

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,650
After a year I came back and wanted to see
Haldane.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,820
He was always happy, kind, and honest.

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,140
I wanted to see the smile in his blue eyes
again and hear his happy laugh, so I went

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,640
to visit him in London.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,250
But this time he did not laugh.

26
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,500
He was miserable, his face was pale and he
looked weak and ill.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,729
He was packing his things, and there were
lots of big boxes full of furniture and books

28
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:50,610
around the house.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,119
'I'm moving,' he said.

30
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,659
I don't like this house.

31
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,880
There's something strange about it; I'm going
tomorrow.'

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,329
'Let's go out and have some dinner,' I said.

33
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,240
'I'm too busy.'

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,600
He looked nervously around the room.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,509
'Look, I'm really happy to see you, but...

36
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,250
Why don't you go to the restaurant and bring
back some food?'

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,900
When I came back, we sat by the fire and ate
the food.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,790
I tried to tell jokes and he tried to laugh,
but sometimes he looked into the shadows in

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,440
the corners of the room.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,740
We finished our meal, and then I said, 'Well?'

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,760
'What's the matter?'

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,210
'You tell me,' I answered.

43
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,090
He was silent.

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,230
Again he looked into the shadows.

45
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,950
'You're very nervous,' I said.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,220
'What is it?

47
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,310
Drink?

48
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,400
Gambling?

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,489
Women?

50
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,080
Tell me, or go and tell your doctor.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
You're ill, my friend.'

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,140
'I won't be your friend if you talk like that.'

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,239
'Well, I am your friend, and something is
wrong.

54
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,190
Come on, tell me.'

55
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,739
But he did not tell me anything.

56
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,319
He asked me to stay for the night, but I had
a room in a hotel so I left him.

57
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,939
When I returned the next morning, he was gone
and some men were putting his boxes into a

58
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,040
van.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,080
Haldane did not leave his new address.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,209
I saw him again more than a year later.

61
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,049
He came to see me early one morning before
breakfast.

62
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,879
He looked really bad, worse than before.

63
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:48,500
His face was thin and white, like a ghost,
and his hands were shaking.

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,180
I invited him to have breakfast with me, but
I did not ask him any questions because I

65
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,459
knew he wanted to tell me something.

66
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,959
I made coffee, talked and waited.

67
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,890
'I'm going to kill myself,' he began.

68
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,680
'Don't worry, I won't do it here or now.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,060
I'll do it when it's necessary, when I can't
continue to live any more.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,069
And I want somebody to know why.

71
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,250
Can I tell you?'

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,100
'Yes, of course,' I said, astonished.'

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,070
'You must promise not to tell anybody while
I'm alive,' he said.

74
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,630
'I promise.'

75
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,580
He looked at the fire silently.

76
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,100
'It's difficult to begin,' he said.

77
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,380
'You remember George Visger, don't you?'

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,380
'Yes.

79
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,229
I haven't seen him for a long time, but somebody
told me he went to an island to teach vegetarianism

80
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,389
to the cannibals.'

81
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,150
I laughed.

82
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,070
'Anyway, he's gone.'

83
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,750
Haldane did not laugh.

84
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,680
'Yes, he's gone.

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,220
But not to an island.

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,860
He's dead?â€™

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,180
'Dead?

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,500
How?'

89
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,860
'You remember he always knew when people did
bad things, and told the teacher?

90
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,380
Well, he told a girl some bad things about
me.

91
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,789
I loved her, but she left me.

92
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,990
Then she died suddenly - oh, it was terrible!

93
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,319
When I went to the funeral, he was there.

94
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,290
I came back home and sat thinking about it,
and then he arrived.'

95
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,650
'I hope you told him to go away,' I said angrily.

96
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,650
'No.

97
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,400
I listened to him.

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,160
He came to say it was better that she was
dead and we hadn't got married.

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,500
I asked why and he said because there was
madness in my family.'

100
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,669
'And is there?'

101
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:50,010
'I don't know, but he said he knew and had
told my girlfriend.

102
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,610
I said I never knew anything about madness
in the family.

103
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,400
And he said, "So, you see, it's better you
didn't get married, isn't it?"

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,380
And then i put my hands round his neck.

105
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,130
I don't know if I meant to kill him, but that's
what happened.'

106
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,229
I was shocked.

107
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:15,160
I said nothing; what can you say when your
friend tells you he is a murderer?

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,349
Haldane continued.

109
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,130
'I saw that he was dead, but I was very calm.

110
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,370
I sat down and thought, there's no blood,
no weapon.

111
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,990
Everybody knows Visger is going to an island,
and he told me he's said goodbye to them.

112
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,990
So there's no problem; I must get rid of his
body, that's all.'

113
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,020
'How?'

114
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,060
He smiled.

115
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,550
'No, I won't tell you.

116
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,650
You promised not to tell anybody, but maybe
you'll talk in your sleep or when you have

117
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,729
a fever one day.

118
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,129
I'll be safe if you don't know where the body
is, do you see?'

119
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,729
I was sorry for my friend, but I could not
believe he was a murderer.

120
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,970
I said, 'Yes, I see.

121
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,810
Look, let's go away together.

122
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,819
Let's travel and see the world, and forget
about Visger.'

123
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,470
He looked very happy.

124
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,540
'You understand and you don't hate me!

125
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,190
Why didn't I tell you before?

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,669
It's too late now.'

127
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:18,669
'Too late?

128
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,600
No, it isn't.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,960
Come on, we'll pack our suitcases tonight.

130
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,440
We'll go where nobody can find us.'

131
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,539
He said, 'When I tell you what has happened
to me, you'll change your mind.'

132
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,620
'But I know what has happened to you.'

133
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:42,919
'No,' he said slowly, 'I've told you what
happened to him, not what happened to me.

134
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:43,919
That's very different.

135
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,030
Did I tell you what his last words were?

136
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,099
Just before I put my hands around his neck
he said, "Careful, Haldane!

137
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,729
You'll never get rid of my body."

138
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,539
Well, I got rid of his body, and I forgot
about his last words.

139
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:06,599
But a year later I was sitting here and I
suddenly remembered them.

140
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,310
"I got rid of your body very easily, Visger!"

141
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,820
I said.

142
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,949
And then I looked at the carpet in front of
the fire and - Aaah!'

143
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,819
Haldane screamed very loudly.

144
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:24,319
'I can't tell you - no, I can't!'

145
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,020
CHAPTER TWO

146
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,190
A Haunted

147
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,849
At that moment we heard thunder outside.

148
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:38,159
I went to the window and saw some dark storm
clouds in the sky.

149
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,970
'Where was I?'

150
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,970
Haldane said.

151
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,970
'Oh yes.

152
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,490
I looked at the carpet and there he was - Visger.

153
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,279
I can't explain it: the door was closed, the
windows were closed.

154
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,580
He wasn't there before, and he was there now.

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,690
That's all.'

156
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,490
'A hallucination,' I said.

157
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,709
'That's exactly what I thought,' he answered.

158
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,030
'But I touched it.

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,450
It was real; it was heavy and hard, like stone.

160
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,589
The arms were rigid like the arms of a statue.'

161
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,570
'It was a hallucination,' I repeated.

162
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,180
'Well, I thought somebody had put him here
to frighten me, so I went to the place where

163
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,320
I had hidden him, and he was there, just as
he was a year before.'

164
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,230
'My dear Haldane,' I said, 'this is very funny.'

165
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,470
'You might think it's funny, but when I wake
up in the night and think of it, it isn't

166
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,430
funny at all.

167
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,930
I don't want to die in the dark, Winston.

168
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,459
That's why I think I'll kill myself, so I'm
sure that I won't die in the dark.'

169
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,670
'Is that all?'

170
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,520
'No, he came back again.

171
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,070
I was asleep on the train one day, and when
I woke up, he was on the seat opposite me.

172
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,440
He looked the same as before, hard and rigid
like a statue.

173
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,610
I threw him out of the window in a tunnel.

174
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,490
If I see him again, I'll kill myself.

175
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,660
You think I'm mad, but I'm not.

176
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,240
You can't help me, nobody can help me.

177
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,670
He knew, you see?

178
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,860
He said, "You'll never get rid of my body,"
and I can't.

179
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,529
He always knew things.

180
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,160
Winston, I promise you I'm not mad.'

181
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,820
'I don't think you're mad; I think your mind
is disturbed.

182
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,270
But we'll stay together; if you can talk to
me, you won't imagine things.'

183
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,770
So we went travelling together, and I was
full of hope.

184
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,100
Haldane was always a rational man, and I could
not believe he was mad.

185
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,730
I wanted to help him get better.

186
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,050
After a month or two the 'madness' passed
and we joked and laughed again.

187
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,260
I was extremely happy that my old friend was
normal.

188
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:05,700
'He's forgotten about Visger,' I thought,
'and now he's fine!'

189
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,950
We arrived in Bruges, where there was a big
exhibition and all the hotels were full.

190
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:18,300
We could only find one room with a single
bed in a hotel called the Grande Vigne, so

191
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,530
I had to sleep in the armchair.

192
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,990
We had dinner and went to a pub, and it was
late when we returned to our room.

193
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,340
We talked for a while, and then Haldane got
into bed.

194
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,300
I tried to sleep in the armchair, but it was
not very comfortable.

195
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,100
I was nearly asleep when Haldane began to
talk about his will.

196
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,880
'I've left everything to you, Winston,' he
said.

197
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,480
'I know I can trust you to take care of everything.'

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,500
'Thank you,' I said sleepily.

199
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,709
'Let's talk about it in the morning.'

200
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,480
But he continued, telling me what a good friend
I was.

201
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,940
I told him to go to sleep, but he said he
was thirsty.

202
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,820
'Oh, alright,' I said.

203
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,350
'Light the candle and go and get some water
- and then please let me sleep!'

204
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,340
'No, you light it.

205
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,709
I don't want to get out of bed in the dark.

206
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:24,360
I might step on something or walk into something
that wasn't there when I got into bed.'

207
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,820
I lit the candle, and he sat up in bed and
looked at me.

208
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,699
His face was very pale, his hair untidy and
his eyes were shining.

209
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,279
'That's better,' he said.

210
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,959
'Oh, look here!

211
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,149
There are two big letters on the sheet in
red cotton.

212
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,649
GV!

213
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,410
George Visger!'

214
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,990
'No, it's the symbol of the Hotel Grande Vigne,'
I said.

215
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,820
'Hurry up and get the water!'

216
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,610
'Please come with me, Winston.'

217
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,300
'I'll go down by myself.'

218
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,290
And I went to the door with the candle in
my hand.

219
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,060
He jumped off the bed in a second.

220
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,060
'No!

221
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,730
I don't want to stay alone in the dark,' he
said like a frightened child.

222
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,160
I tried to make a joke of it, but I was very
disappointed.

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,481
It was clear to me that all my time spent
trying to help him had been wasted, and that

224
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:23,709
he was not better after all.

225
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:29,490
We went down as quietly as we could, and got
some water from the dining room.

226
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,450
Haldane took the candle from me, and went
very slowly back towards our room.

227
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,260
He looked around very carefully.

228
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,550
I knew what he was looking for, and I became
angry and nervous.

229
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,220
When we entered the room, I almost expected
to see something on the carpet, but of course

230
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,329
there was nothing.

231
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,600
I put out the candle, pulled the blankets
round me, and tried to get comfortable in

232
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
my chair so I could sleep again.

233
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,940
'You've got all the blankets,' Haldane said.

234
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,130
'No, I haven't.

235
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,820
Only the ones I had before.'

236
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,889
'Well, I can't find mine.

237
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,250
I'm so cold.

238
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,589
Light the candle!

239
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:12,700
Quick, light it!

240
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,320
There's something horrible...'

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,779
But I could not find the matches.

242
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,880
'Light the candle, light the candle!' he shouted.

243
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,360
'If you don't, he'll come to me, he'll come
in the dark.

244
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,750
I can't die in the dark; please, Winston,
light the candle!'

245
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,610
'I am lighting it,' I said angrily.

246
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,050
But in the dark I was trying to find the matches
with my hands - on the shelf, the table...

247
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,670
I could not remember where I had put them.

248
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,279
'You're not going to die.

249
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,529
It's alright.

250
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,779
I'll get the matches in a second.'

251
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:44,779
'It's cold.

252
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:45,779
It's cold.

253
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,899
It's cold,' he said, like that, three times.

254
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,389
And then he screamed loudly, like a child,
or like a rabbit attacked by dogs.

255
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,980
'What is it?'

256
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,829
I cried.

257
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,680
There was silence.

258
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:11,110
Then, very slowly, 'It's Visger,' he said,
and his voice seemed strange and distant.

259
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,690
'Of course it isn't!'

260
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,700
My hand found the matches as I spoke.

261
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,930
'He's here!' he screamed.

262
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,460
'Here, next to me.

263
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,880
In the bed.'

264
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,339
I lit the candle.

265
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,079
I ran to the bed.

266
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,430
He was lying on the edge of the bed.

267
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:34,480
Next to him was a dead man, white and cold.

268
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,990
Haldane had died in the dark.

269
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,990
***

270
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,889
There was a simple explanation.

271
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:48,050
Haldane and I were in the wrong room - the
dead man's room.

272
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,880
His name was Felix Leblanc, and he had died
from a heart attack earlier that day.

273
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,509
I found out more information in England.

274
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:03,079
The police found the body of a man with a
bottle of poison in his hand in a railway

275
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,839
tunnel.

276
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:13,210
His name was Simmons, and he had drunk poison
in Haldane's carriage because he was depressed.

277
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,650
Haldane had thrown his body out of the window.

278
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,250
Haldane left me all his possessions in his
will.

279
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,660
I asked a police inspector to be with me when
I opened the boxes he had left me.

280
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,720
Inside one were the bodies of two men.

281
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,579
One man was identified later; he was a salesman
who had died of epilepsy.

282
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:44,380
The other body was Visger's.

283
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,329
I leave it to you to explain the events in
this story.

284
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,949
I cannot find an explanation that satisfies
me.
