Darkest Hour

00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,920
by Anthony McCarten

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,120
CHAPTER ONE

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,800
Searching for a new leader

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,520
It was May 1940, and the situation in Europe was extremely
serious.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:30,640
The Nazi dictator, Adolf Hitler, and his armies had already invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark and Norway Now
Hitler was preparing to attack the rest of Europe.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,040
Britain and its ally France had declared war on Hitler eight months before, after Germany invaded Poland in September
1939.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,080
But things were going badly for the Allies.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:53,880
The British Parliament and many of the British people were no longer confident about their leader, the Conservative
prime minister, Neville Chamberlain.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:02,120
They did not believe that he had the ability to defeat
Hitler and lead Britain to victory.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:10,640
On the afternoon of 7th May, a meeting of the Members of Parliament (MPs) was taking place in the Houses of
Parliament in London.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,840
The meeting had already continued for several hours and was
very noisy.

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,120
Many MPs were so angry with Chamberlain that they could not
hide their feelings.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,240
They stood up and shouted at him, excitedly, "Out! Out!
Resign! Resign!"

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,120
Chamberlain looked sad, tired and worried.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,000
Earlier in the afternoon, he had made a speech to
Parliament, but it had not gone well.

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,240
The MPs knew that Britain was in terrible danger from a
possible attack by Hitler.

18
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,961
They had realized that they needed a great leader, a strong person who could prevent the Nazis from controlling Britain
and Europe.

19
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:53,681
But they did not believe that Chamberlain was the right man
for the job.

20
00:01:53,681 --> 00:02:07,121
Chamberlain had not thought that Hitler was a dangerous threat to Europe, and two years before, in 1938, he had
tried to make a peace agreement with Hitler.

21
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:12,681
Five days ago, Parliament learned there had been a terrible
disaster for Britain in April.

22
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:24,841
The Nazis had invaded Norway and attacked British troops there. 1800 British soldiers had died, and several warships
were destroyed.

23
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:31,841
Many people felt Chamberlain and his government were responsible because they had not believed that Hitler would
attack Norway.

24
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,881
Many MPs stood up to speak against Chamberlain that day.

25
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,481
One was Clement Attlee, the leader of the Labour Opposition.

26
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:45,081
"The Prime Minister and his friends made a serious mistake
about Norway," he said.

27
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:54,881
"Many soldiers and ships have been lost because of them. But Norway wasn't their only mistake. They've been wrong about
other things, too. They didn't believe that Hitler would

28
00:02:54,881 --> 00:03:02,841
attack Czechoslovakia. A few years ago, they even thought we
should try to make a peace agreement with him."

29
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:06,841
The meeting continued long into the summer night, but
Chamberlain

30
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,401
still refused to resign.

31
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:11,721
The next afternoon, Parliament met again.

32
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:20,641
Meanwhile, some important members of the Conservative government talked to some Labour MPs; they thought the
Labour Party should join the government.

33
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:25,281
They thought it would be good for Britain if Conservative
and Labour MPs could work together.

34
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,921
But the Labour MPs refused.

35
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:32,241
"We won't be part of a government led by Chamberlain," they
said.

36
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:39,161
"If you want us to work with you, Chamberlain and his
friends must go." The MPs continued to attack Chamberlain.

37
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:43,601
"Resign! Resign!" they shouted at him.

38
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:53,281
Then an important man stood up: the Liberal MP David Lloyd George, who had been British prime minister from 1916 to
1922.

39
00:03:53,281 --> 00:04:00,601
Everyone was silent as they listened to Lloyd George,
because he had guided Britain to victory in the First World
War.

40
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:05,441
"You've put Britain in a terrible position," Lloyd George
told Chamberlain.

41
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,441
"It's time for you to go." When he sat down again, the MPs
shouted and cheered.

42
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:19,721
Later that night, a vote was held in Parliament to find out whether the MPs still had confidence in Chamberlain's
government and the way it was running the war.

43
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:25,441
In the vote, forty-one members of the Conservative Party
voted against their own government.

44
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:30,841
So, finally, Chamberlain had to accept that he could not
continue as prime minister.

45
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:40,521
A new leader must be found quickly, but the big question was
- who could that leader be?

46
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:47,041
A few seats away from Chamberlain, one man was sitting
quietly, watching and listening to everything that was
happening.

47
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,481
His name was Winston Spencer Churchill.

48
00:04:49,481 --> 00:05:02,761
He had an important position in the government as First Lord
of the Admiralty, the man in charge of the British navy, but he was not popular with everyone.

49
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:07,121
Jokes were made about him, and there were funny pictures of
him in the newspapers.

50
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:16,801
Many people did not trust him because earlier in his
political career, he had changed his party twice.

51
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:28,282
In 1904, he had left the Conservative Party and joined the Liberal Party, and then in 1924, he had joined the
Conservative Party again.

52
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:37,242
As the top man in the Admiralty, some people also felt he
was responsible for the recent terrible disaster in Norway.

53
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:44,122
So when the Conservative MPs were considering a new prime
minister, they did not immediately think of Winston
Churchill.

54
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:51,082
Instead, many people wanted the Foreign Secretary, Lord
Halifax, to be prime minister.

55
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:56,082
Chamberlain, too, thought Halifax would be a good prime
minister.

56
00:05:56,082 --> 00:06:03,962
Other people also wanted Halifax: the King of Britain, George VI, wanted Halifax, and even the Labour Party wanted
Halifax.

57
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,802
However, there was a problem with Lord Halifax.

58
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:17,642
He was a member of the House of Lords, and in British politics, a member of the House of Lords could not also be
an ordinary Member of Parliament who was chosen in an election by

59
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,322
the British people.

60
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:27,362
On Thursday 9th May, Chamberlain invited Lord Halifax to his
home at Number 10, Downing Street, and asked him to be prime minister.

61
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:32,762
But to Chamberlain's great surprise, Halifax said that he
did not want the job.

62
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:40,642
He said that he would have no real power, because, as a Lord, he was not allowed to take part in meetings of the MPs
in Parliament.

63
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:45,882
Chamberlain was very disappointed because he had been sure
that Halifax wanted to be prime minister.

64
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:51,522
But perhaps there was another reason why Halifax did not
want the job.

65
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:55,802
Halifax knew that Winston Churchill might cause problems for
him.

66
00:06:55,802 --> 00:07:03,002
Winston was clever and ambitious, and he had wanted to be
prime minister since he was a child.

67
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:09,242
He had the ability to be a good leader, and he was very good
at making speeches.

68
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:14,722
But in his political career, Winston had made some bad
mistakes.

69
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:24,562
One of his most serious mistakes had been during the First World War, when hundreds of thousands of men had lost their
lives at Gallipoli in Turkey.

70
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:30,562
However, Winston knew a lot more about battles and war than
Halifax.

71
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:40,282
As a young man, he had trained as an army officer and had direct experience of two important wars, the Boer War and
the First World War.

72
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:50,122
He had fought bravely in the First World War and a war in the Sudan, and he had also worked on the front line of
battle as a war journalist.

73
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:54,922
Halifax did not understand war and military matters as well
as Winston.

74
00:07:54,922 --> 00:08:03,042
Also, much of the British public did not trust Halifax because he had agreed with Chamberlain's idea of making a
peace agreement with Hitler.

75
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:10,082
After the meeting with Halifax in the morning, Chamberlain
made an important decision.

76
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:17,482
He asked Halifax and Winston to come to the prime minister's
house at Number 10, Downing Street, that afternoon.

77
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:24,642
He told them he had decided to resign, but he would be happy
to be in a government led by either of them.

78
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:31,042
Halifax repeated that he did not want to be prime minister
and said that Winston would be the right man for the job.

79
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:35,602
So Winston Churchill agreed to be the new prime minister of
Britain.

80
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:43,202
He knew he had a very difficult job ahead of him - to save Britain and its people from the terrible threat of a Nazi
attack.

81
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:46,322
But Winston felt strong and confident.

82
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:59,203
Later, he said, "I felt as if all my past life had prepared me for this moment... I was sure I would not fail." Winston
had become responsible for the future of his country.

83
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:00,723
CHAPTER TWO

84
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,683
Winston's early life

85
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:08,203
So who was Winston Churchill, the man with the difficult job
of leading Britain to victory?

86
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:11,443
Winston had done many different things in his life.

87
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:18,003
He had been a soldier, a painter, a journalist and had a
political career.

88
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:22,363
He knew how to use words well and make excellent speeches.

89
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:27,603
He had acted bravely in two important wars and had been a
prisoner of war, too.

90
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:32,163
But he had also made some serious mistakes.

91
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:37,083
He took risks, and sometimes he made decisions without
thinking about them carefully enough.

92
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:41,483
Winston's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had been in
politics, too.

93
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:45,323
Lord Randolph came from a very old and famous English
family.

94
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:54,163
Winston's mother, Jennie Jerome, was the daughter of a rich American businessman who was known as "The King of Wall
Street".

95
00:09:54,163 --> 00:10:06,683
Winston was their first child, and he was born at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, on 30th November 1874, when Victoria
was Queen of Britain.

96
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:11,763
In Victorian times, most rich parents did not have a close
relationship with their children.

97
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:16,123
They did not look after their children themselves but
employed a lady to take care of them.

98
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:28,083
Winston's mother, Jennie, was a beautiful young woman who loved parties and travel, so she did not spend much time
with Winston and his younger brother, Jack.

99
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,163
Later, Winston wrote:

100
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:43,403
"My mother... shone for me like the Evening Star. I loved her (very much) - but (from far away) Winston also loved his
father, Lord Randolph Churchill. But

101
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:56,043
Randolph was even further from his sons than Jennie because he was very busy with his political career. He was a
Conservative MP with an important position in Parliament. However,

102
00:10:56,043 --> 00:11:09,003
Randolph's health was not good, and he died from illness at the age of forty-five. Winston was very sad about his
father's death because he had wanted to be closer to him and

103
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:18,723
understand him better. He had hoped to become an MP like
Randolph and enter Parliament at his father's side.

104
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:22,843
When he was a child, the most important person for Winston
was the

105
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:35,483
lady who looked after him, Mrs Elizabeth Everest. She had no children of her own, and she loved Winston and Jack very
much. When she became ill in 1895, the same year as his

106
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:47,723
father's death, Winston hurried to her house and was with her when she died. In his book My Early Life, he wrote, "She
had been my (closest) friend during the whole twenty years

107
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:48,403
that I had lived."

108
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:52,963
When Winston was young, most rich parents sent their sons
away to school.

109
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:57,963
So when he was seven, Winston was sent away to school, too,
and he hated it.

110
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:09,403
He wrote, "I had been so happy (at home) with all my toys...
Now it was to be all lessons." Life away from home at school was very hard for a small boy.

111
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:16,243
In those days, teachers often punished pupils by hitting
them, and Winston was hit, too.

112
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:23,443
In 1888, when he was fourteen, he was sent to Harrow, a very
famous school for boys in North London.

113
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:29,523
Winston was not very good at studying, and he was often put
in the bottom class.

114
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:37,644
But he enjoyed English and history, and one of his teachers,
Mr Somervell, helped him very much.

115
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:42,844
He taught Winston to use words well, and to speak and write
excellent English.

116
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:55,684
Winston wrote poetry and reports for the school newspaper, and his love of words, both spoken and written, stayed with
him all his life.

117
00:12:55,684 --> 00:13:00,364
After leaving school, Winston decided to join the army.

118
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:08,204
In August 1893, he entered Sandhurst, where officers in the
British army are trained.

119
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:18,844
He did very well there, and in 1894, he left in eighth
position out of 150 young men.

120
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:25,084
Then Winston joined a regiment called the 4th Queen's Own
Hussars and trained with them for six months.

121
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:28,444
This was very hard work, but again, Winston did well.

122
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:34,804
At the same time, he was able to enjoy himself, as he was
invited to parties and dinners.

123
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,284
But Winston was beginning to feel frustrated.

124
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,564
As a young army officer, he wanted to get direct experience
of battle.

125
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:48,524
In early 1895, the Cuban War of Independence had started
between Spain and Cuba.

126
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:54,924
Winston travelled to Cuba and sent reports about the war to
a British newspaper in London.

127
00:13:54,924 --> 00:14:00,604
In his new job as a war journalist, he was able to use the
writing skills he had learned at school.

128
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:05,244
After a month in Cuba, he went back to London to live with
his mother.

129
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:12,484
However, on 11th September, Winston and 1,200 other men from
the 4th Hussars regiment were sent to India.

130
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:19,484
In Victorian times, India was the most important colony in
the British Empire, the countries ruled by Britain.

131
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:28,804
Winston's regiment arrived in Bombay at the start of October
1896, then moved to the southern city of Bangalore.

132
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:34,244
Winston enjoyed his new life in India very much and found it
very interesting.

133
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:40,444
Winston was always interested in learning new things and
educating himself more.

134
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:46,484
He loved reading, but he had realized that there were many
subjects he did not know enough about.

135
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:53,244
So he asked his mother to send him books from England about
history and politics and other subjects.

136
00:14:53,244 --> 00:15:08,124
Every month, new books arrived, and from November 1896 to
May 1897, Winston read for four or five hours every day.

137
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:13,964
He learned many things that would help him greatly in his
future political career.

138
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:20,724
In the spring of 1897, Winston started to feel that it was
time to go back to England.

139
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:27,284
He was still with the army in India, but now he wanted to enter politics and become a Member of Parliament like his
father.

140
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:33,484
So he returned to London, and on 26th June, he made his
first political speech.

141
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:43,004
It went well, but immediately afterwards he had to return to India because fighting had started between the British and
the Afghans.

142
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:47,084
Winston sent reports about the fighting to two newspapers.

143
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:52,964
Winston never forgot that his father had died an early death
at the age of forty-five.

144
00:15:52,964 --> 00:15:59,604
People had sometimes described Lord Randolph as "a man in a
hurry", and Winston was the same kind of person.

145
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:03,604
Like his father, he wanted to do many things as fast as
possible.

146
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,164
In 1898, there was a war in the Sudan.

147
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:16,285
Winston travelled there to join the regiment of Lord
Kitchener, the officer in charge of the British army.

148
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:24,685
Winston not only fought in battles but also continued his work as a war journalist and sent reports about the war to
British newspapers.

149
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:32,205
He returned to England in March 1899 because he had a chance
of starting a political career.

150
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:40,325
The MP for Oldham, a town in the north-west of England, had
died, so there was an election for a new MP there.

151
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:48,525
Winston stood as the Conservative candidate, but although he worked very hard, he did not succeed in winning the
election.

152
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:54,805
In October 1899, another war, the Boer War, started in South
Africa.

153
00:16:54,805 --> 00:17:05,405
Winston became a war journalist again and travelled to South Africa to report on the war, but after only a few weeks, he
was taken prisoner.

154
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:12,845
However, he managed to escape, and after walking for many
miles in the hot sun, he came to a railway line.

155
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:17,165
He jumped on a train, which took him to a safe part of the
country.

156
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:20,165
By this time, Winston was becoming quite famous.

157
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:27,405
Many people in South Africa and Britain read about his
adventures, and they thought he was very brave.

158
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:32,965
After he returned to England in July 1900, he immediately
began to think about politics.

159
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:39,045
He stood as Conservative candidate for Oldham again, and
this time he won the election.

160
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:45,765
On 1st October 1900, he finally became a Member of
Parliament at the age of twenty-five.

161
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:50,685
But although Winston was now an MP, he did not stop doing
other things.

162
00:17:50,685 --> 00:18:01,165
He continued writing, and he went on a speaking tour of the UK, the USA and Canada, making speeches about his adventures
in the Boer War.

163
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:09,765
On 22nd January 1901, news reached him that Queen Victoria
had died and there was a new king, Edward VII.

164
00:18:09,765 --> 00:18:17,565
Winston immediately returned to England and took his place in Parliament, making his first speech there on 18th
February.

165
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:21,525
The first four years of Winston's life as an MP were quiet.

166
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:27,445
He watched and listened to everything carefully, and he
learned many things about politics.

167
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:34,565
But he was also ambitious and did not want to sit quietly
all his life at the back of Parliament.

168
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:38,645
He wanted to be at the front, making important decisions
about Britain.

169
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:42,725
However, he would have to wait another forty years before
that happened.

170
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:48,925
Winston did not always agree with the policies of his party,
the Conservative Party.

171
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:55,765
So on 31st May 1904, he left the Conservative Party and
joined the Liberal Party.

172
00:18:55,765 --> 00:19:02,245
Many people were shocked that Winston had changed his
political party, but he did not care.

173
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:11,405
In the Liberal Party, he worked closely with David Lloyd George, his friend and ally, who would later become prime
minister.

174
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:17,685
In December 1905, the Conservative prime minister resigned,
and a Liberal MP became prime minister.

175
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:21,845
Winston was given the job of being responsible for the
colonies.

176
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:31,045
He did well, and in 1908, he was offered a position in the Cabinet, the group of important ministers who controlled
government policy.

177
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,885
At about this time, something very important happened in
Winston's private life.

178
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:38,685
He was invited to dinner by a friend in London.

179
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:44,566
A woman was sitting next to him at the dinner table.

180
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,846
Her name was Clementine (Clemmie) Hozier.

181
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:52,806
She was twenty- three years old and had just left the
Sorbonne University in Paris.

182
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:56,366
Winston and Clemmie fell in love and were married six months
later.

183
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,806
Clemmie was the perfect wife for Winston.

184
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:02,766
She always thought about what was best for Winston and
Britain before herself.

185
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:09,766
However, sometimes Winston could be quite rude to people,
and Clemmie always told him when he was behaving badly.

186
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:19,886
Winston and Clemmie had special names for each other:
Winston called Clemmie "Kat", and she called him "Pug" or
"Pig".

187
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:26,206
On 11th July 1909, Winston and Clemmie's first daughter,
Diana, was born.

188
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:33,646
But after the baby's birth, Clemmie was not well, so she
went to stay with her sister in the countryside.

189
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:38,206
When she returned to London, she found Winston very busy
with his political career.

190
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,206
CHAPTER THREE

191
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,406
A dangerous threat

192
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:46,446
Winston had to stand for Parliament again, and this time he
lost to the Conservative Party candidate.

193
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:56,166
But two weeks later, he stood again for election as the Liberal candidate in Dundee, Scotland, and won an easy
victory, which gave him a safe place in Parliament.

194
00:20:56,166 --> 00:21:00,446
In 1911, the Liberal Prime Minister, H.H.

195
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:12,086
Asquith, gave Winston a top job as First Lord of the Admiralty Winston was now in charge of the British navy and
was lent a wonderful house, Admiralty House, in London.

196
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:17,806
On 28th May 1911, Winston and Clemmie's second child,
Randolph, was born there.

197
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:21,406
Winston's new job was not an easy one.

198
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,166
He was also becoming very worried about Germany.

199
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:31,486
For a long time, he had seen that Germany was slowly
building up its army and navy, making them larger and
stronger.

200
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:38,486
Winston thought this situation was very dangerous, because
Germany could be planning to attack Britain.

201
00:21:38,486 --> 00:21:44,166
So he spent a lot of money on building British warships and
making them faster and better.

202
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:50,926
The money spent on the navy was increased from 39 pounds
million to 50 pounds million.

203
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:56,766
Most of Winston's colleagues in the Cabinet were not as
worried as he was about Germany.

204
00:21:56,766 --> 00:22:03,326
Also, many British people thought Germany was a peaceful
European country and not a possible threat to Britain.

205
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:10,606
However, Winston continued making speeches in Parliament,
warning people that Germany was becoming dangerous.

206
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:15,286
When the First World War started in 1914, Winston was ready.

207
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:22,126
But in the first few months of the war, over 5,500 men in
the navy died.

208
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:31,886
Many of his colleagues did not think that Winston was doing a good job as top man in the navy, and the newspapers
attacked his policies.

209
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:34,846
Then Winston travelled to the city of Antwerp in Belgium.

210
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:45,446
The British army was in a very difficult situation because Antwerp was surrounded by German troops, so when Winston
arrived, he immediately wanted to help the army.

211
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:49,846
He decided the best way of doing this would be to lead the
British troops himself.

212
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:57,486
So he sent a message to Prime Minister Asquith, saying that he wanted to resign from his job as First Lord of the
Admiralty.

213
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:01,606
But Asquith refused and told Winston to come back to London
at once.

214
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:15,166
However, Winston stayed in Belgium for three more days, finally arriving back in England on 7th October, the same
day as his third child, his daughter Sarah, was born.

215
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:22,287
Then a terrible disaster happened for Winston, possibly the
worst of his political career.

216
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:27,367
Britain and Russia were allies, so they were fighting on the
same side in the war.

217
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:33,727
But the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) was an ally of Germany and
an enemy of Britain and Russia.

218
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:40,567
The government of Britain had made an ambitious plan for
British warships to take British troops to Gallipoli in
Turkey.

219
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:52,207
The British government was sure that, if Britain invaded Turkey, Turkey would quickly decide to leave the war and
make a peace agreement with Britain and its ally Russia.

220
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:58,487
Then Britain would be able to sail its warships past
Istanbul and up through the Black Sea to Russia.

221
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,927
However, the British plan was very badly organized.

222
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:14,407
This was because there was not just one plan but three plans, each with a different person in charge - Winston; one
of Winston's colleagues in the Admiralty; and Lord Kitchener.

223
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:18,287
Each man had different ideas about how the plan should work.

224
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:24,527
Winston was sure that his ideas were the best, and he did
not want to follow the other plans.

225
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:28,447
His plan was to use only warships, without the help of the
army.

226
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:38,247
This was accepted, but after three British warships were destroyed by the Turkish army, the British government
decided Winston's plan was no good.

227
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:47,407
So in April 1915, troops arrived at Gallipoli, but the
British had not expected that the Turkish army would fight
back.

228
00:24:47,447 --> 00:25:05,807
Over the next eight months, about 400,000 men lost their lives: 73,000 British and Irish; 36,000 Australian and New
Zealand; 27,000 French; 4,800 Indian; and 251,000 Turkish.

229
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:11,447
Finally, in January 1916, the British government decided to
evacuate the troops from Gallipoli.

230
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:20,047
The disaster at Gallipoli was not Winston's mistake alone, but many people still felt he was responsible for what had
happened.

231
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:24,407
He had pushed his plan forward and had not listened to his
colleagues' ideas.

232
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:34,287
After what happened at Gallipoli, many people in Britain were not happy with the Liberal government, so Prime
Minister Asquith invited some Conservative MPs to join the

233
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:36,047
government, too.

234
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:41,287
However, the Conservative MPs refused to work with Winston,
so he had to go.

235
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:43,887
Winston was very sad and angry.

236
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:45,767
"I am finished!" he said.

237
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:55,167
Winston was no longer First Lord of the Admiralty, so he, Clemmie and their children had to move out of Admiralty
House, where they had been very happy.

238
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:59,607
Later, Clemmie said this had been one of the saddest times
in Winston's life.

239
00:25:59,647 --> 00:26:06,847
He still wanted to help Britain, so he decided to join the
British army, which was fighting the Germans in France.

240
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:14,087
At the end of January 1917, his regiment travelled to Belgium, where he fought with the troops in the front line
of battle.

241
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:26,527
On 7th May 1917, Winston returned to London and his political career, but it would be almost three years before
he became a Cabinet minister again.

242
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:37,247
On 11th November 1918, Britain and its allies made peace with Germany, and four days later, Winston and Clemmie's
fourth child, a daughter, was born.

243
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,047
They called her Marigold.

244
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:47,647
Winston's old friend and ally, David Lloyd George, had become prime minister, and he appointed Winston as Minister
for War.

245
00:26:47,687 --> 00:27:00,808
Winston was very happy about this, but in 1921, he made some bad decisions about the war in Russia so he was moved to a
different job, Minister for the Colonies.

246
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:05,648
The year 1921 was terrible for Winston and Clemmie.

247
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:15,208
First, Clemmie's brother, Bill, killed himself in a hotel room in Paris, and then a few months later Winston's mother
died.

248
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:19,328
Then another very sad thing happened.

249
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:25,488
Their little daughter, Marigold, became very ill, and
Winston and Clemmie hurried to be with her.

250
00:27:25,488 --> 00:27:38,888
On the evening of 22nd August, Marigold asked Clemmie to sing her favourite song, but, as Clemmie was singing,
Marigold put her hand on her mother's arm and said, "Not tonight...

251
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:43,168
finish it tomorrow." However, the next morning the little
girl died.

252
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:48,408
All their lives, Winston and Clemmie felt terrible pain
about the death of Marigold.

253
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:57,888
They went on holiday to France, and just over a year later,
their fifth and last child, Mary, was born.

254
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:05,008
The same year, they bought a house in the country,
thirty-five miles south of London in Kent.

255
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:08,128
They called the house Chartwell.

256
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:17,888
Clemmie did not really like Chartwell, but she knew it was important for Winston to have a quiet place of his own where
he could relax, write and paint.

257
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:25,448
In 1924, Winston changed political parties again and went
back to the Conservative Party.

258
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:32,968
Soon afterwards, the new prime minister, Stanley Baldwin,
appointed him Chancellor of the Exchequer.

259
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:40,368
So Winston and his family moved into the Chancellor's house in London at 11 Downing Street, next door to the prime
minister.

260
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:47,448
Over the next few years, there were many problems in both Britain and other countries for Winston and the British
government.

261
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,128
One difficult problem was India.

262
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:55,648
India was a British colony, but now she wanted independence
from Britain and its own government.

263
00:28:55,688 --> 00:29:03,208
Winston was very much against this idea because India was
the most important country in the British Empire.

264
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:09,248
He thought that, if India left the British Empire, the
Empire would be destroyed.

265
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,088
But many people did not agree with Winston, and they thought
he did not understand India very well.

266
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:20,168
One of these people was Lord Halifax, who was responsible
for India then.

267
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,808
Another big problem was Germany.

268
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:33,688
For a long time, Winston had strongly believed that there was a serious threat to Britain from Hitler and the National
Socialist German Workers' Party (the Nazi Party).

269
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:40,888
The Party had started in 1920, two years after the end of
the First World War.

270
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:44,648
It had grown larger over the years and was now very strong.

271
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:52,328
Winston had travelled a lot through Germany and had been worried about the large groups of young men he had seen
marching through the cities.

272
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:59,208
They wanted to fight for their country and make Germany
great again after it was defeated in the First World War.

273
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:05,368
In April 1933, Winston made a long speech in Parliament
about a possible threat from Germany.

274
00:30:05,408 --> 00:30:14,488
He said that Hitler was a dangerous dictator and that he was
probably planning to attack Britain.

275
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:21,088
Over the next few years, Winston continued to make speeches,
warning people about Hitler and the Nazi Party.

276
00:30:21,088 --> 00:30:24,648
He wrote letters to newspapers and also to his colleagues.

277
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:33,169
But many people in Britain did not believe that Hitler was dangerous, and they were more worried about a possible
threat from Russia.

278
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:41,449
Winston warned people that Germany was building up its army and navy, and he advised that Britain should build up its
army, too.

279
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:49,249
He was sure that Hitler was planning to attack Austria,
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania.

280
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:57,609
Some of Winston's colleagues were starting to listen to him,
but others said he was a "warmonger" - someone who wants war with other countries.

281
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:04,329
In May 1937, Neville Chamberlain became prime minister.

282
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:10,369
His Foreign Secretary was Anthony Eden, who shared the same
opinion as Winston about Hitler.

283
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:21,609
Eden thought that Chamberlain was making a big mistake about Hitler and that he was too soft and friendly towards both
Hitler and the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini.

284
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:33,729
In November 1937, Lord Halifax, now back in Britain from India, went on holiday to Germany, and Chamberlain
encouraged him to visit Hitler while he was there.

285
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:41,329
Eden was not happy about a meeting between Halifax and
Hitler, and he warned Halifax to be hard on Hitler.

286
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:49,849
But when Halifax returned, he said that Hitler had been
extremely friendly and did not want to start a war in
Europe.

287
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:59,969
Eden thought that Hitler was lying, so he resigned from the government in February 1938, and Halifax became Foreign
Secretary.

288
00:31:59,969 --> 00:32:05,089
Winston was shocked that Eden had resigned and could not
sleep all night when he heard the news.

289
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,049
He was sure Eden was the only man strong enough to save
Britain.

290
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:15,249
In September 1938, Chamberlain travelled to Germany to meet
Hitler in Munich.

291
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:20,209
When he came back, he was very happy because he was sure he
had saved Britain from war.

292
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:30,689
He told the British people that he had discussed many things with Hitler, and Hitler had said he did not want war and
promised not to invade other European countries.

293
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:33,809
But many people in Britain did not believe Hitler.

294
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:39,649
They felt that Chamberlain had been too soft with him and
agreed too easily to everything Hitler wanted.

295
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:47,609
At the next meeting in Parliament, Winston made a very
strong speech, warning his colleagues again about Hitler.

296
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:54,049
Then on 15th March 1939, German troops marched into
Czechoslovakia.

297
00:32:54,089 --> 00:33:02,569
Finally, everyone understood that Winston had been right for many years, and that Hitler had lied to Chamberlain in
Munich.

298
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:10,409
So when Hitler invaded Poland in September 1939, Britain and
France declared war on Germany.

299
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:11,889
CHAPTER FOUR

300
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:13,569
The new prime minister

301
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:22,569
As the evening of 9th May 1940 ended, Winston was preparing
himself for the huge job of leading Britain.

302
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:36,409
Randolph, his son, had called him at the Admiralty earlier that day, and Winston had said, "I think I shall be prime
minister tomorrow." Every morning, Winston's breakfast was

303
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:37,609
brought to his bedroom.

304
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:41,849
But on the morning of 10th May, Winston had a shock.

305
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:51,049
He was woken a little after 5.30 a.m. not by someone bringing his breakfast, but by some terrible news: Germany
had invaded Holland.

306
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:57,729
Boxes of telegrams were arriving from the Admiralty, the War
Office and the Foreign Office.

307
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:04,650
At 6 a.m., Winston called the French ambassador to discuss
sending troops into Belgium, the country south of Holland.

308
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,970
But then news came that Hitler had invaded Belgium, too.

309
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:16,010
At the start of the war, both Holland and Belgium had said
that they did not want to take part in the war.

310
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:23,250
So it was very easy for Germany to invade these countries,
because their armies were not ready for an attack.

311
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:36,090
After Winston finished his phone call with the French ambassador, he went to a meeting with the Ministers for Air
and War, Sir Samuel Hoare and Oliver Stanley, to discuss what

312
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,210
Britain was going to do about the German attack.

313
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:46,610
Later, Hoare remembered that Winston was very strong and
full of confident advice.

314
00:34:46,690 --> 00:35:03,370
The three men then moved to the upstairs War Room at the Admiralty for a meeting with Britain's top military leaders
at 7 a.m.

315
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,730
More news was beginning to arrive about the terrible
situation in Europe.

316
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,570
It was reported that the Germans had begun their attack at 3
a.m.

317
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:22,370
The German air force, the Luftwaffe, were bombing important places in Holland, Belgium and now Luxembourg, and thousands
of German soldiers had arrived in these countries, which

318
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,050
were known as the Low Countries.

319
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:31,810
Winston and the military leaders decided to order the French
and British armies to begin marching into Belgium.

320
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:39,810
Meanwhile, British people listening to the seven o'clock news on the radio had a great shock when it was announced
that Germany had invaded Holland.

321
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:46,690
Randolph was with Winston's old regiment, the 4th Queen's
Own Hussars.

322
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,890
He called his father at 7.30 a.m. to try to find out what
was happening.

323
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:58,690
Winston informed him that the Germans had invaded the Low Countries but that the British and French armies were
marching forward to fight them.

324
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,170
Then Randolph asked, "What about... you becoming prime
minister?"

325
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,690
"Oh, I don't know about that," replied Winston.

326
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,050
"Nothing (is important) now except beating the enemy."

327
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:15,130
But this was still the big question - who would be prime
minister?

328
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,050
Chamberlain had still not resigned.

329
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,930
He had said he would be happy to stay as prime minister if the Labour Members of Parliament agreed to join his
government.

330
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,170
So everything depended on Labour's decision.

331
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:39,490
However, Clement Attlee and his colleague, Arthur Greenwood, had gone to an important Labour Party meeting in
Bournemouth, so they would not be able to contact Chamberlain until

332
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,730
later.

333
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:52,410
Just before 8 a.m., Winston, Hoare and Stanley walked from the Admiralty to the prime minister's house at Number 10,
Downing Street, where the War Cabinet was meeting.

334
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:58,890
Twenty ministers, military leaders and other important
people sat around the table to discuss the German attack.

335
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:06,850
Although Chamberlain, not Winston, was prime minister, it soon became clear to everyone that Winston was in charge of
the meeting.

336
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,890
In less than three hours, he was running the war.

337
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:19,090
Although Chamberlain had nothing important to say during the meeting, afterwards he told Hoare that he did not think he
should resign "until the French battle was finished".

338
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,130
This was very surprising because most people were expecting
Chamberlain to go immediately.

339
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:32,930
That morning, the British newspapers had all said Chamberlain was going to resign and Winston was going to
become prime minister.

340
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,170
Chamberlain had been wrong about too many things.

341
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:45,371
For the past six years, Winston had warned the government, Parliament and the British people about the threat from
Hitler, but Chamberlain had not listened.

342
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:56,411
When Hitler and Chamberlain met in Munich in September 1938,
Hitler had promised that he would not attack other countries in Europe, and Chamberlain had believed him; he thought

343
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:58,291
he had made a peace agreement with Hitler.

344
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:02,971
But Winston knew that Hitler was lying, and he refused to be
silent.

345
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:12,171
Many rich and important people did not want to listen to Winston and called him a warmonger, but Winston knew that it
was impossible to make a peace agreement with a dictator.

346
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:20,451
However, when Chamberlain refused to resign, he was not only
thinking about his own position.

347
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:26,891
He really believed that Winston was not the right man to
lead Britain, and many other people agreed with him.

348
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:33,931
They thought that Britain needed a leader who was calm and
quiet, and thought carefully before making decisions.

349
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:41,371
Winston was neither calm nor quiet, and in the past, he had
taken a lot of risks and made some bad mistakes.

350
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:46,291
So a lot of people were very nervous about Winston becoming
prime minister.

351
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:54,091
Also, some important people like Lord Halifax still believed
it would be possible to have peace talks with Hitler.

352
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:57,731
The War Cabinet met again that day, at 11.30 a.m.

353
00:38:57,771 --> 00:39:04,011
By this time, the German tanks were moving quickly across
the Low Countries and had almost reached France.

354
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:16,851
The War Cabinet learned that the Germans had also bombed the city of Nancy in France, but there was not much information
about this and some of it was not correct.

355
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:28,731
General Ironside, the head of the British army, informed the Cabinet that the Germans were probably planning to cross
through Luxembourg and the Ardennes Forest to the Belgian

356
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:29,891
line at the River Meuse.

357
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:36,291
At the same time, the Germans were probably going to march
through Belgium towards the troops of the Allies.

358
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:48,251
But actually, the German army had moved more quickly than the Allies thought and had managed to get much further,
because the Belgian troops had not been ready for a German attack.

359
00:39:48,291 --> 00:40:01,091
A third meeting was held at the Admiralty at 1 p.m. and a fourth meeting at Number 10, Downing Street, at 4.30 p.m. to
discuss what to do about the attack on Belgium.

360
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:11,851
At 1 p.m., General Sir Hastings Ismay, a strong ally of Winston, reminded his colleagues of a plan, Plan D, made
earlier by the British.

361
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:18,411
Since the start of the war, over 394,000 British soldiers
had been in France.

362
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:22,931
These troops were called the British Expeditionary Force
(BEF).

363
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:29,811
According to Plan D, if the Germans attacked Belgium, the
British government would send the BEF to defend it.

364
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:35,531
At 4.30p.m, the War Cabinet discussed the possible bombing
of Germany.

365
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:46,251
The Germans had already bombed important places in Holland, Belgium, France and Switzerland, as well as five places on
the coast of Kent, in southeast England.

366
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:49,531
Winston listened carefully to the opinions of his
colleagues.

367
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:55,531
All the men sitting around the Cabinet table were very
experienced, and he trusted them greatly.

368
00:40:55,571 --> 00:41:07,491
Hoare and another top man in the air force, Sir Cyril Newall, wanted to start bombing Germany immediately, but
Ironside was against this idea because it would not help the battle

369
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:08,571
on the ground.

370
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:17,612
He said it would be better to wait for twenty-four hours before starting the attack, and both Winston and Chamberlain
supported his opinion.

371
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:23,212
At the end of the meeting, Chamberlain announced that he had
received a message from the Labour Party.

372
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:27,492
They said that they were ready to be part of "a new
Government, under a new Prime Minister".

373
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:33,252
Chamberlain realized that he could not continue as prime
minister if the Labour Party were not going to support him.

374
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:38,852
He said he would go and see King George VI that evening and
tell him he was going to resign.

375
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:43,412
Shortly afterwards, he left for Buckingham Palace and met
with the king.

376
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:48,932
He formally resigned from his position and advised the king
that the new prime minister should be Winston.

377
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:53,292
But Winston's name was not the one the king had been hoping
to hear.

378
00:41:53,292 --> 00:42:01,532
Later, the king wrote in his diary that he thought
Parliament had behaved very badly towards Chamberlain.

379
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:12,372
He thought Halifax was the best man to be the new prime minister, and when Chamberlain told him Halifax did not want
the job, he was very disappointed.

380
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:23,972
He wrote in his diary: "Then I knew that there was only one person whom I could send for to form a Government... and
that was Winston. I asked Chamberlain his advice, and he told

381
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:27,132
me Winston was the man to send for."

382
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:35,132
Winston knew not everybody was happy about him becoming prime minister, and sometimes he felt he could never escape
from his past mistakes.

383
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:44,172
During this time, Clemmie, his wife, had been away, and
Winston missed her love, help and advice very much.

384
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:48,812
So he called her, asking her to return to London as soon as
possible.

385
00:42:48,812 --> 00:43:03,612
Clemmie arrived just before he left for Buckingham Palace and told Winston she believed he was the only man who could
be prime minister.

386
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:13,852
Shortly before 6 p.m. on 10th May 1940, on his way to the palace, Winston began to feel very excited about his new
position.

387
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:16,852
It was the job he had dreamed of all his life.

388
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:23,092
The meeting with the king went surprisingly well, and
Winston felt very happy.

389
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:36,612
Later, Winston wrote that the king had even joked with him and said, "'I suppose you don't know why I have sent for
you.' I replied, 'Sir, I (really) couldn't imagine why.' He

390
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:41,452
laughed and said, 'I want to ask you to form a Government.'"

391
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:47,732
After Winston was driven back home and stepped out of the
car for the first time as prime minister of Great Britain,

392
00:43:47,732 --> 00:44:02,972
he turned to a policeman beside him and said, "God alone knows how great it is. All I hope is that it is not too
late. I am very much afraid it is. We can only do our best." Tears

393
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:06,932
came into his eyes as he turned away and said something
quietly to himself.

394
00:44:06,972 --> 00:44:15,052
Then he began climbing the stairs to start planning his new
War Cabinet.

395
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:24,492
After Winston became prime minister, the first thing he did
was to write a letter to Chamberlain.

396
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:30,932
He thanked Chamberlain for promising to support him and help
Britain during this difficult time.

397
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:40,452
He said that he knew that the road ahead would be long and dangerous, and he needed and depended on Chamberlain and was
proud to have him as his friend.

398
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:43,252
Then he wrote a similar letter to Halifax.

399
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:50,093
It was very clever of Winston to write these letters to Chamberlain and Halifax, because they were a way of keeping
them on his side.

400
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:55,253
He hoped that they would support him and not cause him any
problems.

401
00:44:55,253 --> 00:45:02,853
Winston also appointed himself as Minister of Defence because this would give him the chance to run the war as
well as the country.

402
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:14,693
Then he appointed his close ally, Anthony Eden, as Minister for War, a Labour MP as First Lord of the Admiralty, and the
leader of the Liberal Party as Minister for Air.

403
00:45:14,693 --> 00:45:21,493
Then Winston read all the letters and telegrams that had
arrived, wishing him well in his new job.

404
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:27,773
At 9 p.m. he turned on the radio to hear Chamberlain
speaking to the British people for the last time.

405
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:32,013
Chamberlain spoke for five minutes, and his speech was very
good.

406
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:43,733
He told the people about the terrible things that had happened that day and that Hitler had added to his "horrible
crimes" by attacking Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.

407
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:55,733
Then Chamberlain explained that, during his three years as prime minister, he had always tried to solve problems
through peace, but now he realized that it was impossible to avoid

408
00:45:55,733 --> 00:45:56,013
war.

409
00:45:56,013 --> 00:46:00,933
He said the British people must support their new leader and
fight Hitler to the end.

410
00:46:00,973 --> 00:46:08,173
After listening to Chamberlain's speech, Winston continued
working for another six hours until 3 a.m.

411
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:17,213
The day had brought enormous changes to his life, but he
felt happy and excited, and he slept very well that night.

412
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:18,693
CHAPTER FIVE

413
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,013
Two different kinds of men

414
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:26,373
Many people in Parliament and Britain had hoped that Lord Halifax would become prime minister, and when Halifax said
he did not want the

415
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,333
job, they were very surprised.

416
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:35,813
An American friend wrote in his diary, "I don't understand
why, since a more ambitious man never lived..."

417
00:46:36,013 --> 00:46:40,413
Halifax and Winston were two different kinds of men, both in
how they

418
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:41,853
looked and in their ideas.

419
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:46,773
Halifax was very tall with pale skin, and he had no left
hand.

420
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:49,413
He was also very good at horse riding.

421
00:46:49,413 --> 00:46:56,173
He was born on 16th April 1881 in Devon, into a rich family
who were deeply religious.

422
00:46:56,173 --> 00:47:04,253
Halifax was his parents' fourth son, but sadly, his three
older brothers had all died by the time he was ten.

423
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:12,093
Like the sons of many rich parents, he was sent away to school at Eton College and later went to the University of
Oxford.

424
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:20,573
After Halifax left university, he decided to enter politics
in 1909 as a Conservative MP.

425
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:34,253
He owned land and houses in Yorkshire and London, and later the same year he married Lady Dorothy Onslow, a very kind
woman.

426
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:39,293
In 1910, Halifax became the MP for Ripon in North Yorkshire.

427
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:46,853
When the First World War started, he joined the regiment of the Queen's Own Yorkshire Dragoons and went to fight in
Flanders.

428
00:47:46,853 --> 00:47:50,693
The fighting there was terrible, and many of his friends
died.

429
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:59,813
For the rest of his life, Halifax never forgot the awful things he saw in battle, and this was a strong reason why he
was always against war.

430
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:03,653
Winston's political relationship with Halifax did not begin
well.

431
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:09,973
In 1921, Winston was Minister for the Colonies, and it was
suggested that Halifax could work with him.

432
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:16,533
But Winston was not happy about working with Halifax, and
for two weeks he refused to meet him.

433
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:22,533
Halifax was angry about the way Winston was behaving and
went to his office to argue with him.

434
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:31,214
After this bad start, the two men worked together for some years, but they had different opinions about many important
subjects.

435
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:33,054
One of these was India.

436
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:41,454
At that time, India was ruled by Britain, but many Indians wanted independence from Britain, and there had been some
violent fighting.

437
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:49,094
In 1926, Halifax was made responsible for the government of
India and went there for five years.

438
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:56,534
Halifax strongly supported the idea of Indian independence and had a good relationship with the Indian leader Mahatma
Gandhi.

439
00:48:56,534 --> 00:49:07,014
Other important members of the Conservative Party, including Winston, were against Indian independence and thought that
Halifax was too weak about India.

440
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:13,974
On 31st March 1931, Halifax made an agreement with Gandhi,
and Winston was very angry about this.

441
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:19,494
Later that year, Halifax returned to England and made his
first speech in the House of Lords.

442
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:29,934
In 1935, Stanley Baldwin appointed him Minister of War, and five months later, he was given two more important
government positions.

443
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:40,614
By this time, Hitler had been Chancellor in Germany for two years and was slowly building up the German army, navy and
air force.

444
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:51,334
Anthony Eden, the new British Foreign Secretary, felt very worried about this, but other people in Britain, including
Halifax, did not think there was anything to worry about.

445
00:49:51,374 --> 00:50:00,894
The Allies had defeated Germany in the First World War, and they thought it would take a long time before it became a
strong country again.

446
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:05,814
However, Germany was beginning to show that it was not as
weak as some people thought.

447
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:16,134
After the First World War, Germany and the Allies had signed two important peace treaties: the Treaty of Versailles and
the Treaty of Locarno.

448
00:50:16,174 --> 00:50:23,054
In the Treaty of Locarno, Germany promised never to go to
war again with other countries.

449
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:37,614
It also promised that German troops would never enter the Rhineland, the area of Germany around the River Rhine, close
to the border with France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg.

450
00:50:37,654 --> 00:50:43,494
But in 1936, Hitler broke these promises and sent German
tanks into the Rhineland.

451
00:50:43,494 --> 00:50:47,014
Many people in Britain were not very worried about the
Rhineland.

452
00:50:47,014 --> 00:50:55,574
They thought invading the Rhineland was not the same as invading a foreign country, so the British government did
nothing to stop Hitler.

453
00:50:55,614 --> 00:51:05,814
When he realized that the Allies were not going to punish him for breaking the peace treaties, Hitler started planning
to take back some of the lands Germany had lost after the

454
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:06,694
First World War.

455
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:19,774
After Neville Chamberlain became prime minister of Britain in 1937, he wanted to avoid a second world war, so he tried
to make a peace agreement between Hitler and the British

456
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:20,614
government.

457
00:51:20,654 --> 00:51:29,614
In November 1937, Halifax went on holiday to Germany, and afterwards Hitler invited him to his house in the Bavarian
Alps.

458
00:51:29,614 --> 00:51:34,254
Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, did not want Halifax to
meet Hitler.

459
00:51:34,254 --> 00:51:42,254
He knew that Halifax supported the idea of a peace
agreement, and he did not want him to discuss this with
Hitler.

460
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:49,574
However, Halifax had a very good relationship with
Chamberlain, and Chamberlain encouraged him to go and meet
Hitler.

461
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:59,134
When Halifax returned to Britain, Eden was shocked and angry because Halifax had discussed some things with Hitler that
Eden had warned him not to talk about.

462
00:51:59,134 --> 00:52:07,215
Halifax spoke warmly about Hitler and said that people in Britain were worried only because they did not know about
the wonderful changes he had made in Germany.

463
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:14,495
Halifax reported to the Cabinet that the Germans were not interested in war, because they were "too busy building up
their country".

464
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:22,775
Two months later, in January 1938, Chamberlain formally
announced his policy of making a peace agreement with
Hitler.

465
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:30,655
The British government started to consider ways that some of the lands that Germany had lost after the First World War
could be returned to Hitler.

466
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:34,735
Many people, including Anthony Eden, were not happy about
this.

467
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:43,495
But in February 1938, after Eden resigned, Chamberlain
offered the job of Foreign Secretary to Halifax.

468
00:52:43,575 --> 00:52:49,935
Just over two weeks later, German troops marched into Vienna
because Hitler had decided to attach Austria to Germany.

469
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:55,335
Although Halifax had known this was going to happen, he had
done nothing to stop it until it was too late.

470
00:52:55,375 --> 00:53:03,695
Next, Hitler started thinking about the Sudetenland, the
area of Czechoslovakia where German-speaking people lived.

471
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:10,255
Everybody wondered what Halifax would do if Hitler decided
to attach the Sudetenland to Germany as well.

472
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:15,895
By the summer of 1938, thousands of German troops had
arrived on the border with Czechoslovakia.

473
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:20,455
Chamberlain became worried and asked Hitler for a meeting to
discuss the situation.

474
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:29,775
At the meeting, which happened in Munich in September 1938,
Chamberlain believed all Hitler's promises.

475
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:38,295
As he stepped off the plane back in Britain, he waved a
"peace agreement" that Hitler had signed.

476
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:50,415
Part of the agreement was that Hitler would be given the Sudetenland, and on 1st October 1938 German troops entered
the Sudetenland peacefully.

477
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:54,095
Halifax seemed to keep changing his opinion about Hitler.

478
00:53:54,095 --> 00:54:01,855
On 12th October 1938, he invited Joseph Kennedy, the
American ambassador to Britain, to tea at his house.

479
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:16,375
Later, Kennedy reported to Washington, "I spent an hour and a half with Halifax this afternoon drinking tea... Halifax
does not believe that Hitler wants to have a war with Great

480
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:26,695
Britain." Halifax told Kennedy that he thought Britain should build up its air force, and France should do the
same, and then Hitler could be allowed to "do what he likes in

481
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:27,495
Central Europe".

482
00:54:27,495 --> 00:54:38,975
However, on 9th and 10th November 1938, some terrible things happened in Germany during Kristallnacht, also known as the
Night of Broken Glass.

483
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:48,695
Jewish shops, businesses and other buildings were destroyed all over the country, and many Jewish people were killed or
hurt.

484
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:58,055
People in Britain and other countries were extremely shocked, and Halifax realized that Hitler and the Nazis were
doing terrible things.

485
00:54:58,055 --> 00:55:01,775
He said that there could never be peace until the Nazis were
destroyed.

486
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:07,895
Meanwhile, Chamberlain was becoming old and tired, and he
was beginning to make some serious mistakes.

487
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:21,095
Without telling Halifax, he announced to the newspapers that the situation with Germany was much better than it had been
for some time.

488
00:55:21,095 --> 00:55:28,735
But less than a week later, German tanks entered Prague, and
Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia.

489
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:38,056
Poland was now in danger, and Halifax promised Poland that,
if Germany attacked, Britain would protect them.

490
00:55:38,056 --> 00:55:45,696
So, when Hitler invaded Poland on 1st September 1939,
Britain declared war on Germany.

491
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:54,736
Winston and Halifax were two different kinds of men, and there were many subjects, like India, that they could not
agree about.

492
00:55:54,776 --> 00:56:01,536
Both of them loved Britain deeply and wanted to protect it,
but their ideas about how to do this were very different.

493
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:06,296
Winston believed that the best policy was to meet threats
and dangers face-to-face.

494
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:11,416
Halifax believed that the best policy was to leave other
countries alone.

495
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:15,496
Both of them believed that their way was the only right way
for Britain.

496
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:24,016
On 10th May 1940, the day that he became prime minister,
Winston did not go to bed until 3 a.m.

497
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:36,336
As soon as he woke the next morning, he sent another letter to Neville Chamberlain, asking him and Halifax to meet with
him in the War Room in the Admiralty at 12.30 p.m. so they

498
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:39,096
could look at maps of Europe together and discuss what to
do.

499
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:52,696
Chamberlain agreed, adding that, until Winston had appointed his War Cabinet, he, Halifax and Winston would have to be
responsible for running the war.

500
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:55,696
However, Winston had a problem.

501
00:56:55,696 --> 00:57:02,576
He needed the Labour MPs Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood
to be in his War Cabinet.

502
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:13,496
Attlee and Greenwood not only had refused to be part of a government led by Chamberlain, but now they were saying they
did not want Chamberlain to be in the War Cabinet.

503
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:25,416
So that morning, after he had written to Chamberlain and Halifax, Winston met with Attlee and Greenwood and succeeded
in persuading them to work with Chamberlain.

504
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:36,256
Winston went to his first "Meeting of Ministers" at 12.30 p.m. that day, when he met with Chamberlain, Halifax and six
of the top men in the army, navy and air force.

505
00:57:36,256 --> 00:57:51,896
They discussed a number of important subjects about the war
and made decisions about what Britain was going to do.

506
00:57:51,896 --> 00:57:55,856
After the meeting finished, they agreed to meet again, at 10
p.m.

507
00:57:55,896 --> 00:58:01,656
Winston had only just become prime minister, but already he
was having problems with some of his own party.

508
00:58:01,696 --> 00:58:08,776
Everybody had different opinions about who should be in the
new War Cabinet.

509
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:17,056
General Ironside believed it was very important to include the two Labour MPs, but Halifax and Chamberlain were against
this idea.

510
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:22,056
Also, not everybody was confident about Winston's way of
running things.

511
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:30,376
That afternoon, Halifax and his wife were walking through the gardens of Buckingham Palace on their way to the
Admiralty when they met the king and queen.

512
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:45,936
The king told Halifax he had hoped Halifax would be prime
minister and seemed very worried about Winston.

513
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:50,416
The new War Cabinet was announced on the nine o'clock news
that evening.

514
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:57,656
The second "Meeting of Ministers" was pushed back from 10
p.m. to 10.30 p.m. and did not finish until after midnight.

515
00:58:57,656 --> 00:59:07,656
Halifax was very unhappy about the late meeting, and wrote in his diary: "This night-life is no good to me." But this
was Winston's way of doing things.

516
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:12,577
For him, the best time to have meetings was late at night,
and that was not going to change.

517
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:15,817
This was how he was going to run the war.

518
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:17,657
Things were not easy for Winston.

519
00:59:17,697 --> 00:59:20,177
He was working very hard, with very little sleep.

520
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:25,977
But he did not get much thanks from his colleagues for his
hard work and, instead, some of them complained about him.

521
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:26,817
CHAPTER SIX

522
00:59:26,937 --> 00:59:30,177
"Blood, toil, tears and sweat"

523
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:32,817
Winston had his own ways of doing things.

524
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:36,697
Although he worked late at night, he usually woke up quite
early.

525
00:59:36,697 --> 00:59:49,457
However, he would often work while he was still in bed; he was not a formal kind of person and liked to lie in bed,
smoking, while he discussed what was happening in the war with

526
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:50,097
his colleagues.

527
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:56,297
He always had a short sleep of two hours in the afternoons,
because he knew he was going to stay up late.

528
00:59:56,297 --> 01:00:06,377
After sleeping, he had a hot bath, his second bath of the
day, at 7p.m.

529
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:10,697
Winston loved baths and enjoyed turning over in his bath
like a huge fish.

530
01:00:10,697 --> 01:00:19,457
Sometimes this caused a lot of water to come out of the bath and pass through the floor on to visitors' coats hanging in
a small room below.

531
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:27,217
While Winston was in his bath, his secretary had to wait outside the bathroom door, listening to what he said and
writing it down.

532
01:00:27,217 --> 01:00:39,577
"Chips" Gemmell, one of his secretaries, remembered that Winston used to shout, "Don't come in!" As she stood outside
the bathroom door, she heard "wonderful bathroom noises" and

533
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:42,177
the sound of Winston washing himself.

534
01:00:42,177 --> 01:00:57,817
Sometimes, she said, "he'd call out, 'Don't go away!' (and I said), 'No, no, I'm still here' and the sounds of bathing
(went) on and sometimes... he'd forgotten what he'd wanted

535
01:00:57,817 --> 01:00:58,057
to say".

536
01:00:58,057 --> 01:01:03,977
After Winston got out of his bath, he walked from the
bathroom to his bedroom wearing only a bath towel.

537
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:13,337
However, at Winston's house in Chartwell, if he got out of his bath and wanted to go to another room, he did not wear
clothes at all.

538
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:17,737
Winston wore expensive silk underwear because his skin was
very soft.

539
01:01:17,737 --> 01:01:28,937
Even Hitler and his colleagues had heard stories about Winston, and the Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels wrote in his
diary, "A book on Churchill reports that he drinks too much and

540
01:01:28,937 --> 01:01:37,897
wears silk underwear. He (gives his messages to his secretaries) in the bath..." According to Goebbels, Hitler
thought this was very funny.

541
01:01:37,937 --> 01:01:47,897
It was true that, for many years, Winston had drunk a lot, and because of this, some of his colleagues did not think he
would be able to guide Britain to victory.

542
01:01:47,897 --> 01:01:53,537
Not everybody in Parliament had a good opinion of Winston,
and he knew this could be dangerous.

543
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:57,337
He needed to find a way of winning those people over to his
side.

544
01:01:57,337 --> 01:02:02,737
Although he was extremely popular with the British public,
he needed his colleagues to support him, too.

545
01:02:02,737 --> 01:02:09,417
This was why he wrote the letters to Chamberlain and Halifax immediately after he became prime minister - to win them to
his side.

546
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:15,017
Winston and Clemmie were very kind to Neville Chamberlain
and his wife.

547
01:02:15,017 --> 01:02:25,617
They decided not to move into the prime minister's house at Number 10, Downing Street, immediately, but to stay at the
Admiralty for another month so that the Chamberlains did not

548
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:28,217
have to move out of their home quickly.

549
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:35,537
In his first few days as prime minister, Winston did all he could to make his relationships with his political
colleagues more smooth.

550
01:02:35,537 --> 01:02:40,977
At the same time, he wanted to do his best for the ordinary
British people.

551
01:02:40,977 --> 01:02:52,218
General Ismay remembered how, "two or three days after (Winston) became prime minister, I walked with him from
Downing Street to the Admiralty. A number of people waiting outside

552
01:02:52,218 --> 01:03:06,218
the private entrance (shouted), 'Good luck, Winnie'... as soon as we were inside the building, he (started to cry).
'Poor people,' he said, 'poor people. They trust me, and I can

553
01:03:06,218 --> 01:03:09,538
give them nothing but disaster for quite a long time.'"

554
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:16,218
Winston had formed his new government, and now he started thinking about what he could offer not only to his
colleagues in

555
01:03:16,218 --> 01:03:21,538
Parliament, but also to his country in its darkest hour.

556
01:03:21,538 --> 01:03:33,378
On Monday 13th May 1940, three days after Winston had become prime minister, he made his first speech to Parliament in
his new position.

557
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:40,658
Winston understood that words were powerful, and he was very
clever at using them.

558
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:46,578
He knew this had to be a great speech to win his political
colleagues to his side, so he prepared it well.

559
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:53,098
Winston always took a long time to write his speeches and
thought carefully about what he was going to say.

560
01:03:53,098 --> 01:03:57,538
It was said that every minute of a speech took Winston one
hour's work to prepare.

561
01:03:57,578 --> 01:04:08,098
When he was a young army officer in India in 1896, he had taught himself about many different subjects, including the
art of making speeches.

562
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:18,818
He studied the speeches of famous Greeks, like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and different political leaders in
history.

563
01:04:18,818 --> 01:04:27,738
He believed that, although a good speaker was born with a great skill, they still needed a lot of practice to become
better.

564
01:04:27,778 --> 01:04:36,938
Winston's first speech to Parliament as prime minister was aimed at not only his political colleagues but also the
British public and the world.

565
01:04:36,938 --> 01:04:45,658
He needed people to understand that the situation was very dangerous, but he also wanted them to trust him as their
leader.

566
01:04:45,658 --> 01:04:52,338
Parliament had not met since 9th May, when they had discussed what to do about the Nazi attack on British troops
in Norway.

567
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:59,738
At that time, a large number of Conservative MPs had been
very angry with Chamberlain and shouted at him to resign.

568
01:04:59,738 --> 01:05:05,738
But now some of these MPs felt that they had acted too
quickly, and they were sorry Chamberlain had gone.

569
01:05:05,738 --> 01:05:11,898
They were worried about what was going to happen next, and
they were not confident about Winston as prime minister.

570
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:22,458
So when he entered Parliament, they did not welcome him very warmly; however, when Chamberlain came in, everyone shouted
and cheered.

571
01:05:22,538 --> 01:05:28,258
During the weekend, reports from the war had said that the
situation in Europe was getting worse.

572
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:38,338
That day, German troops had invaded France through the Ardennes Forest, and the queen of Holland, Queen Wilhelmina,
had left her country and come to Britain.

573
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:43,618
Winston knew that, in his speech, he had to make people feel
better about the situation.

574
01:05:43,658 --> 01:05:47,898
Words were all he had to encourage them and give them hope.

575
01:05:47,898 --> 01:05:52,098
At 2.54 p.m., he stood up and began to speak.

576
01:05:52,098 --> 01:06:01,938
He started by asking Parliament to welcome the new government, which the king had asked him to form and which
included members of all parties.

577
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:08,538
He had appointed the new War Cabinet very quickly because
there was no time to lose.

578
01:06:08,538 --> 01:06:14,938
The most important Cabinet positions were already filled,
and the others would be filled the next day.

579
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:28,579
The next words in Winston's speech have become very famous: "... I said to those who have joined this Government: 'I
have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.'"

580
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:38,419
Winston said there were very difficult times ahead, which would continue for many months, and, of course, people
wanted to know what the government was going to do.

581
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:55,939
He said, "You ask, what is our policy? I can say: it is to (fight), by sea, land and air... What is our aim? I can
answer in one word: it is victory..." Without victory, he said,

582
01:06:55,939 --> 01:07:00,059
it would be the end of Britain and the British Empire.

583
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:07,819
However, said Winston, he was sure that it would not be the
end of Britain and that Britain would not fail.

584
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:18,019
He finished by asking everyone to join together and help:
"... I say, 'Come then, let us go forward together...'"

585
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:22,859
Winston's speech was just seven minutes long.

586
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:28,899
Today, that speech is thought to be one of the greatest
speeches ever made in politics.

587
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:39,139
When Hitler made a speech, he said "I" and "me" a lot, but
Winston always said "we" and "us" in his speeches.

588
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:44,819
In this way, he made the British people feel he was with
them and on their side.

589
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:48,459
He could not promise victory, but he gave his listeners
hope.

590
01:07:48,459 --> 01:07:53,619
But on that day, some people in Parliament did not think his
speech was strong enough.

591
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:59,099
Winston was disappointed because he had worked very hard to
prepare it.

592
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:09,819
However, Winston's old friend and ally, Lloyd George, the Liberal prime minister who had guided Britain to victory in
the First World War, then made a speech thanking Winston and

593
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:10,899
supporting him strongly.

594
01:08:10,939 --> 01:08:18,259
Winston did not have to worry about what the British public
thought.

595
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:22,779
The ordinary British people loved his speech and were happy
with their new prime minister.

596
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:25,739
Many newspapers also supported him.

597
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:33,739
One newspaper showed a picture of a crowd of men following Winston, with the words "All behind you, Winston" under the
picture.

598
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:40,459
Meanwhile, Winston and the War Cabinet met again to discuss
the latest reports from the war.

599
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:51,179
The War Cabinet met in special War Rooms under Whitehall in central London, where they received telephone reports about
the war and discussed their plans.

600
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:55,819
Winston informed the meeting that he thought the Germans
were going to attack Britain by air.

601
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:59,179
Everything was now happening very quickly in Europe.

602
01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:07,099
Three million German troops were marching across Europe, with another two million German soldiers ready and waiting
back home.

603
01:09:07,139 --> 01:09:16,739
On Tuesday 14th May, the War Cabinet received the news that the French had retreated to the city of Antwerp in Belgium
and, together with Belgian troops, were trying to hold the

604
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:17,499
line against the Germans.

605
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:20,659
Further, south, the German army had crossed the River Meuse
into France.

606
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,339
This was a terrible shock for the Allies.

607
01:09:22,339 --> 01:09:28,259
For many centuries, the River Meuse had protected France, Belgium and Holland from enemies attacking from the east,
but the German army had managed to cross it easily.

608
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:30,579
There was other bad news, too.

609
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:41,819
Halifax told the meeting that the French ambassador to London had received a message from Queen Wilhelmina of
Holland, now living in Buckingham Palace, saying that Holland was

610
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,659
considering peace talks with Hitler.

611
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:49,339
Then Halifax informed the meeting about a telegram he had
received from the British ambassador in Rome.

612
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:58,540
It said that the Italian leader, the dictator Benito
Mussolini, was making threats to enter the war on Germany's
side.

613
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:04,060
Everybody was extremely worried about this, but Winston said
they would have to wait and see what happened.

614
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:10,340
Later that day, Winston informed the War Cabinet about a
telephone message from the French prime minister, Paul
Reynaud.

615
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:19,100
The message said that German troops and tanks had crossed the French army lines at Sedan, a town further south on the
River Meuse.

616
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:30,860
Reynaud said the French could not stop the German army unless they received help from the British, and asked
Winston to send a large number of fighter planes as soon as possible.

617
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:34,420
Winston called Reynaud early the next morning.

618
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,180
Reynaud was worried and nervous, and he had terrible news.

619
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:48,100
Although the French army had tried to stop the Germans, they
had failed, and the Germans were now marching towards Paris.

620
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:53,620
The road to Paris was open, said Reynaud, and the battle was
lost.

621
01:10:53,620 --> 01:11:06,380
He asked if Britain could send more troops to help the French, but Winston replied that this was impossible,
although he also said that Britain would continue fighting to the end.

622
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,820
CHAPTER SEVEN

623
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,660
Friends and enemies

624
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:13,340
Meanwhile, Halifax had two more pieces of bad news.

625
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:21,020
The first was that Holland was planning to surrender two
cities, Rotterdam and Utrecht, to the Nazis.

626
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:36,940
The second was about a report that Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador to London, had received from a colleague
in Rome, which said that Mussolini had decided to join the war.

627
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:47,620
If this happened, France would be in a terrible position, because it would have two enemies on its borders - Germany
and Italy.

628
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:55,580
Halifax asked Winston to send a message to Mussolini to try to persuade him not to enter the war, and Winston agreed to
do this.

629
01:11:55,580 --> 01:12:01,900
Winston then informed the War Cabinet about another message
he was planning to send to President Franklin D.

630
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,940
Roosevelt of the USA, asking for his help against the Nazis.

631
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:15,620
When Winston was First Lord of the Admiralty, he had formed a very good relationship with President Roosevelt, so now he
was able to write to him very openly.

632
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:19,940
He told Roosevelt that the situation in Europe was getting
worse.

633
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:29,500
Hitler had invaded France and was destroying the smaller countries one by one, and Mussolini was probably going to
enter the war on Hitler's side.

634
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:39,340
Britain was expecting an air attack from the Germans, but the British people were preparing for it and, "If necessary,
we shall continue the war alone, and we are not afraid of

635
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:39,740
that".

636
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:47,140
He asked if Roosevelt could send forty or fifty warships and
several hundred planes and other equipment to help Britain.

637
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:58,700
Winston told Roosevelt the British would pay for everything they were asking for, but if at some time in the future
Britain had no money, he hoped that Roosevelt would simply give

638
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,180
these things to Britain.

639
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:09,420
He also asked if Roosevelt could send American ships to Ireland, to prevent Hitler invading Britain through that
country.

640
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:21,100
Since 1933, when Hitler rose to power as Chancellor of Germany, Roosevelt had said that America would not take part
in any future war in Europe.

641
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:27,180
However, although they had no active part in the war, many
people in the US were against Hitler.

642
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:33,981
Roosevelt supported the Allies by selling them planes, ships
and other war equipment.

643
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:44,981
Two weeks before Winston wrote to Roosevelt, Britain had bought 324 fighter planes from the US for the army and
eighty-one for the navy.

644
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:55,621
After he had written to Roosevelt, Winston also wrote to the Italian dictator, Mussolini, but it was a very different
kind of letter from his letter to Roosevelt.

645
01:13:55,621 --> 01:14:01,781
That letter had been warm and friendly, but Winston's letter
to Mussolini was very short.

646
01:14:01,781 --> 01:14:12,541
He reminded Mussolini about meetings they had had in Rome and asked if it was too late to stop "a river of blood"
between the British and Italian peoples.

647
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:17,421
Although they could hurt each other badly, he did not want
this to happen.

648
01:14:17,421 --> 01:14:29,821
Nobody knew what the result of the battles in Europe would be, he told Mussolini, but "England will go on to the end,
even quite alone, as we have done before".

649
01:14:29,941 --> 01:14:39,381
However, Winston continued, he was confident that the United
States would help Britain.

650
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:48,101
He finished by saying it would be terrible for Britain and Italy to fight each other and asked Mussolini to think again
about entering the war.

651
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:55,621
Two days later, Winston received Mussolini's reply, but it
was not very positive or friendly.

652
01:14:55,621 --> 01:15:07,941
He reminded Winston that, in 1935, when Italy had attacked Abyssinia in Africa, Britain had encouraged other countries
to join together against Italy.

653
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:17,141
He also informed Winston that Italy had recently signed a treaty with Germany, so Italy's actions would be according
to the policy in this treaty.

654
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:25,661
At 11.30 a.m. on 16th May, there was another meeting of the War Cabinet, and again the reports about the situation with
the war were terrible.

655
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:34,141
The German army had marched into France at a place near the Ardennes Forest that the French had thought would be very
difficult for the Germans to cross.

656
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:43,101
Now everything depended on what the French would do and if
the French army would surrender to the Germans.

657
01:15:43,101 --> 01:15:53,301
Winston knew that the French prime minister, Paul Reynaud, was very worried and nervous, and he was afraid that Reynaud
was planning to make a peace agreement with Hitler.

658
01:15:53,301 --> 01:16:00,141
So he decided to go to Paris and meet with Reynaud and
encourage him to be strong and fight back.

659
01:16:00,141 --> 01:16:03,661
That afternoon, Winston flew to Paris with General Ismay.

660
01:16:03,661 --> 01:16:10,341
During the meeting, Reynaud and the French Minister of Defence asked if Britain could send more fighter planes to
France.

661
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:18,181
Although the French had begun the battle with 650 fighter
planes, they now had only 150.

662
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:28,301
Britain had lost thirty-six planes when defending the River Meuse, but Winston still called the War Cabinet and asked
them to agree to send more planes to France.

663
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:36,741
The War Cabinet met at 11 p.m. and agreed with Winston that
they should send more planes.

664
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:39,981
This made the French leaders feel more confident.

665
01:16:40,021 --> 01:16:48,861
Early the next day, Winston returned to London and reported what had happened at the meeting in Paris to the War
Cabinet.

666
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:56,181
He said that, although Reynaud was very happy that Britain
was sending more planes, the meeting had not been easy.

667
01:16:56,181 --> 01:17:02,981
Meanwhile, Winston had received a message from Roosevelt,
but it was not the answer he was hoping for.

668
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:12,782
Roosevelt said that he was considering carefully everything Winston had said in his letter, but he could not help the
Allies immediately, and everything would "take time".

669
01:17:12,782 --> 01:17:17,542
Winston was very disappointed, as Roosevelt had been his
last hope.

670
01:17:17,542 --> 01:17:26,782
So the War Cabinet decided Winston should tell the British people that they were in a situation of the greatest
emergency, and Chamberlain asked Winston to make a speech on

671
01:17:26,782 --> 01:17:27,662
national radio.

672
01:17:27,662 --> 01:17:33,022
Meanwhile, the German army was moving quickly towards the
north coast of France.

673
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:42,542
There were about 400,000 British troops in France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), in a position near the
Belgian border with France.

674
01:17:42,542 --> 01:17:54,622
On Sunday 19th May, the War Cabinet met again to discuss whether it would be better for the BEF to retreat from their
position and start moving to the north coast of France, from

675
01:17:54,622 --> 01:17:56,622
where it might be possible to evacuate them.

676
01:17:56,622 --> 01:18:07,702
However, Winston and some other members of the War Cabinet thought this would be a bad idea because it would be very
easy for the German planes to bomb the troops.

677
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:14,502
After the meeting, at 6 p.m., Winston started planning what
he was going to say to the people of Britain.

678
01:18:14,502 --> 01:18:20,742
He worked hard for three hours, thinking about the best
words to make people feel strong and brave.

679
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:25,302
At 9 p.m., he went on national radio to make his speech.

680
01:18:25,302 --> 01:18:32,382
Winston spoke to the British people honestly and openly because he wanted them to understand that the situation was
very serious.

681
01:18:32,382 --> 01:18:35,622
First, he told them about what was happening in the war.

682
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:47,662
He said that a huge battle was taking place and the German troops and tanks were moving quickly across France, but that
the British Royal Air Force was helping the French army to

683
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:48,822
stand against them.

684
01:18:48,862 --> 01:18:54,702
The German army was large, strong and well trained, with
excellent equipment.

685
01:18:54,702 --> 01:18:59,742
However, Winston said he felt very confident about the
French army and its leaders.

686
01:18:59,742 --> 01:19:06,942
Winston said that the German army had only invaded a small
area of France and had lost many men in the attack.

687
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:20,902
Britain's fighter planes were doing a great job and had attacked and destroyed many of the German planes, as well as
bombing places in Germany where war equipment and weapons were

688
01:19:20,902 --> 01:19:21,462
produced.

689
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:28,862
He then warned the British people to expect attacks from
Germany over the next few days.

690
01:19:28,862 --> 01:19:38,342
Britain was ready for these attacks, and now people at home had to do everything possible to support the British
soldiers fighting on the front line of battle.

691
01:19:38,342 --> 01:19:46,702
If Britain was going to win the war, the army needed more
planes and weapons with which to fight the enemy.

692
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:59,222
He continued by saying that "our (job) is not only to win the battle - but to win the war" and that after the battle
in France was over, "there will come the battle for our island

693
01:19:59,222 --> 01:20:07,302
- for all that Britain is, and all that Britain means" and
that this would be a very difficult time.

694
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:15,142
However, he had received promises from the French prime minister that "(the French) will fight to the end", and
Britain would do the same.

695
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:27,422
In the government he had formed, people came from different parties and in the past had different opinions, but now
everybody had only one aim - to fight "until victory is won,

696
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,302
and never to surrender..."

697
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:35,662
The British and French people would fight side by side to
save Europe from the terrible danger in front of it.

698
01:20:35,662 --> 01:20:40,662
Winston's colleagues in Parliament thanked him warmly for
this wonderful speech.

699
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:53,543
Anthony Eden wrote to him that evening and said, "You have never done anything as good or as great. Thank you, and
thank God for you." Stanley Baldwin, who had once been prime

700
01:20:53,543 --> 01:21:07,143
minister, wrote to him to say, "I listened to your well-known voice last night and I (want to shake) your hand
for a (short) moment and to tell you that from the bottom of my

701
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:13,863
heart I wish you all that is good - health and (a strong)
mind and body..."

702
01:21:13,863 --> 01:21:19,343
Meanwhile, the first German tanks had reached the French
coast near the town of Abbeville, just fifty

703
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:21,183
miles across the sea from England.

704
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:31,623
Ten days before, when the Nazis invaded Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, most people had not believed that a strong
country like France could also fall to Germany.

705
01:21:31,623 --> 01:21:34,383
But now it looked as if this could actually happen.

706
01:21:34,383 --> 01:21:40,063
Winston was becoming very frustrated that he could not get
correct information about the war quickly enough.

707
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:50,543
So he sent General Ironside to France to find out what was happening with the battle and the situation of the French,
Belgian and British armies.

708
01:21:50,543 --> 01:22:00,383
Meanwhile, the War Cabinet met again on 20th May at 11.30
a.m. to discuss how Britain could best support its allies.

709
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:07,903
Winston and the War Cabinet agreed that they could not send
any more fighter planes to help the French.

710
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:19,903
They believed that the Nazis were probably going to try to attack Britain very soon, and if Britain was going to
continue fighting, it needed all its planes to protect itself.

711
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:27,783
However, if Britain did not help France, there was the
danger that the French army would surrender to the Germans.

712
01:22:27,783 --> 01:22:39,863
The evening before, Winston had sent a telegram to President Roosevelt asking if he could send more planes to Britain,
and he was still waiting for Roosevelt's reply.

713
01:22:39,863 --> 01:22:44,263
He had told Roosevelt that Britain would never surrender to
Hitler.

714
01:22:44,303 --> 01:22:51,983
General Ironside returned to London on the morning of 21st
May, and came straight to the War Cabinet.

715
01:22:51,983 --> 01:22:55,903
Things had not gone very well for him in France.

716
01:22:55,903 --> 01:23:03,143
While he was staying at a hotel in Calais, the Germans had started to bomb it, and he had just managed to escape with
his life.

717
01:23:03,183 --> 01:23:05,783
There was only bad news to report.

718
01:23:05,823 --> 01:23:12,383
He had become very frustrated with the French military
leaders because they could not decide what to do.

719
01:23:12,383 --> 01:23:21,503
The Allied troops could not move quickly along the roads because of hundreds of thousands of people trying to escape
from Belgium and the towns in the north of France.

720
01:23:21,503 --> 01:23:32,263
The German army was pushing forward to Boulogne on the coast, with the aim of preventing the British and Belgian
armies in the north from joining up with the French army to the

721
01:23:32,263 --> 01:23:32,663
south.

722
01:23:32,663 --> 01:23:39,263
Winston decided that he had to return to France as soon as
possible to persuade the French leaders not to surrender.

723
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:45,503
So, early the next morning, 22nd May, he flew back to Paris
to meet Prime Minister Reynaud.

724
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:50,503
The BEF was in a terrible situation without enough food or
equipment.

725
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:57,783
If they reached the north coast of France, there was still
the problem of how to evacuate 300,000 soldiers.

726
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:04,463
The German air force, the Luftwaffe, controlled the skies and would bomb the troops while they were waiting on the
beaches.

727
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:09,183
However, when Winston arrived in Paris, there was some good
news.

728
01:24:09,183 --> 01:24:14,623
The French had appointed a new military leader, General
Weygand.

729
01:24:14,623 --> 01:24:22,744
Although the general was seventy-three, he was very ready to
make decisions and told Winston about his "plan of war".

730
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:27,584
Britain had already sent as many troops to France as
possible.

731
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:36,864
More British soldiers had arrived at Boulogne that day and were on the way to protect the towns of Calais and Dunkirk
on the north coast of France.

732
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:48,024
Weygand informed Winston that there was already a large number of French troops in these towns, and it would be a
disaster for the British, Belgian and French troops in the north

733
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:50,904
to try to join up with the rest of the French army in the
south.

734
01:24:50,984 --> 01:24:56,944
Winston agreed with Weygand and flew back to London for a
meeting with the War Cabinet at 7.30 p.m.

735
01:24:56,944 --> 01:25:02,824
Later, General Ironside wrote in his diary that he had been
very surprised because Winston seemed so full of hope.

736
01:25:02,824 --> 01:25:08,784
Winston told the War Cabinet that an attack by British and
French troops was going to happen the next day.

737
01:25:08,784 --> 01:25:14,544
But when they met again on 23rd May, there were no reports
of an attack.

738
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:21,664
Instead, the Luftwaffe were bombing Boulogne, and the German
army had almost surrounded the town.

739
01:25:21,664 --> 01:25:30,224
The British had sent ships with more food and equipment for the BEF to Calais, but the Luftwaffe were preventing it from
being taken off the ships.

740
01:25:30,264 --> 01:25:31,704
CHAPTER EIGHT

741
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:34,744
Saving the British army

742
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:45,504
Neville Chamberlain had not spoken very much during the War Cabinet meetings of the past few days, but at the meeting on
23rd May, he gave

743
01:25:45,504 --> 01:25:46,704
his opinion.

744
01:25:46,704 --> 01:25:52,944
He said that, instead of attacking, it would be better for
the BEF to retreat.

745
01:25:52,984 --> 01:26:03,584
There was still a chance to evacuate the troops back to Britain, but if this did not happen and the BEF was
destroyed, there would be no army to defend Britain.

746
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:12,824
As usual, Lord Halifax supported Chamberlain, and then he read out a telegram he had received from the British
ambassador in Rome.

747
01:26:12,824 --> 01:26:21,544
According to the ambassador, Mussolini was only waiting for the German army to control the towns on the north coast of
France before declaring war.

748
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:29,784
It was clear that Halifax thought Italy had a key part in
what was going to happen next in Europe.

749
01:26:29,864 --> 01:26:39,304
The situation had become extremely serious, with the British army retreating, the fall of France and a possible new
enemy, Italy, entering the war.

750
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:43,624
Winston needed to tell Parliament what was happening.

751
01:26:43,624 --> 01:26:48,904
He spoke to them at 3 p.m., but in this speech, he did not
mention anything about "victory".

752
01:26:48,904 --> 01:26:59,224
The next morning, Winston was shocked to learn that the German army was already in Boulogne, that the soldiers in
the BEF had only half their normal amount of food and that

753
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:02,344
Weygand's plan to attack the Germans in the north had not
yet begun.

754
01:27:02,344 --> 01:27:06,424
So Winston called Weygand at 6 p.m. to ask what was going
on.

755
01:27:06,424 --> 01:27:14,024
Weygand informed Winston that the French army had succeeded
in taking back three French towns from the Germans.

756
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:18,384
Although Winston believed him, actually this information was
false.

757
01:27:18,424 --> 01:27:28,304
When the War Cabinet met at 7 p.m. that evening, Winston told them he was considering Chamberlain's idea of
evacuating the British army from France.

758
01:27:28,344 --> 01:27:38,384
The situation in Boulogne was a disaster, he said, and perhaps it was time for the BEF to retreat to the coast,
although General Weygand still thought that the British and French

759
01:27:38,384 --> 01:27:40,864
armies should continue attacking the Germans.

760
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:47,984
Winston was not confident that the general's plan would succeed, but he was not sure about evacuating the troops,
either.

761
01:27:47,984 --> 01:27:51,384
It would be very dangerous, and many soldiers would probably
die.

762
01:27:51,384 --> 01:27:56,985
Winston then went to Buckingham Palace to inform King George
VI about the situation.

763
01:27:56,985 --> 01:28:10,545
The king was very worried and later wrote in his diary, "The Prime Minister came at 10.30 p.m. He told me that if the
French plan made... by Weygand did not (succeed), he would

764
01:28:10,545 --> 01:28:23,265
have to order the BEF back to England. This... would mean (they would lose) all guns, tanks... in France. The question
was whether we could get the troops back from Calais and

765
01:28:23,265 --> 01:28:29,545
Dunkirk." After Winston returned to the Admiralty, he was
told that Weygand's plan was going wrong.

766
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:41,945
During that night, 1,000 British troops were evacuated from Boulogne while the Germans were bombing them heavily, but
200 soldiers were not able to escape.

767
01:28:41,945 --> 01:28:49,265
Meanwhile, just over twenty miles up the coast, Brigadier
Nicholson and his troops were defending Calais.

768
01:28:49,265 --> 01:28:52,785
The town was surrounded by the German army, and there was no
way out.

769
01:28:52,785 --> 01:29:02,705
But Nicholson and his soldiers had to continue fighting because there was no other large town between Calais and
Dunkirk, where most of the BEF was arriving.

770
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:10,305
If Nicholson surrendered, there would be nothing to prevent the German army from reaching Dunkirk before the BEF could
be evacuated.

771
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:18,705
As the situation in France became worse and the direct danger to Britain increased, Winston became more and more
worried.

772
01:29:18,705 --> 01:29:22,025
He became ill, and his doctor ordered him to stay in bed.

773
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:26,985
But Winston was not a good patient, and he continued to run
the war from his bed.

774
01:29:26,985 --> 01:29:35,025
He heard that General Ismay had sent a message to Brigadier
Nicholson in Calais to advise him to evacuate his men.

775
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:39,785
Winston was very angry about this and sent another message
to Nicholson.

776
01:29:39,785 --> 01:29:47,545
He told him his job was to stay in Calais and fight the German troops, to give the army time to evacuate the BEF
from Dunkirk.

777
01:29:47,585 --> 01:30:00,145
Eater that day on 24th May, General Ironside reported that the German tanks had passed the west side of Calais and were
now between the town and the sea.

778
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:09,265
Brigadier Nicholson was hoping for another order to evacuate his men from Calais, and he did not know that the War
Cabinet had decided not to do this.

779
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:13,865
At 7.05 p.m., Nicholson sent a message asking for more
troops.

780
01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:27,825
At 11.23 p.m., Nicholson received an answer from the War Cabinet, telling him not to evacuate and ordering him to
"(choose the) best position and fight on".

781
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:36,825
The next day, Winston himself sent a strong message to Nicholson, telling him how important for Britain and France
it was to defend Calais.

782
01:30:36,905 --> 01:30:49,465
"The eyes of the Empire are upon... Calais." Meanwhile, Winston had received a telegram from Paul Reynaud informing
him that the BEF was no longer following General Weygand's plan

783
01:30:49,465 --> 01:30:52,585
and was moving towards the towns on the north coast of
France.

784
01:30:52,585 --> 01:30:56,865
The road to Dunkirk was now wide open to both British and
German troops.

785
01:30:56,865 --> 01:31:07,585
When Halifax realized that there was no longer a plan for the BEF to attack the Germans, but instead it was retreating
to the coast, he started thinking again about approaching

786
01:31:07,585 --> 01:31:09,785
Mussolini with the idea of making peace.

787
01:31:09,785 --> 01:31:19,265
He knew that many rich people in the Conservative Party would support this idea because it was very important for
them to keep their lands and families safe.

788
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:26,665
They would be very happy about making a peace agreement with
Mussolini if Britain could not continue fighting because its army was destroyed.

789
01:31:26,665 --> 01:31:33,066
Prime Minister Reynaud was on his way from France to London
to discuss the war situation.

790
01:31:33,066 --> 01:31:38,786
Winston warned the War Cabinet that Reynaud was probably
going to tell them that France could not continue fighting.

791
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:41,066
Halifax could no longer be silent.

792
01:31:41,066 --> 01:31:46,226
He informed the War Cabinet about a meeting he had at the
Italian Embassy in London.

793
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:57,666
At this meeting, it was said that there were many important people in Italy who did not want war, and that if the
British government approached the Italian government to discuss a

794
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:01,706
possible agreement, this would be welcomed by the Italians.

795
01:32:01,746 --> 01:32:06,266
The Italian ambassador had told Halifax that Mussolini
wanted "peace in Europe".

796
01:32:06,266 --> 01:32:11,026
Halifax had replied that this was what Britain wanted, too.

797
01:32:11,066 --> 01:32:21,866
Halifax told the War Cabinet that the most important thing now for Britain was not to win the war but to keep
independence for itself and its Empire.

798
01:32:21,906 --> 01:32:28,826
Britain was losing the war, and if there was a chance to prevent the deaths of more young people, Britain should take
it.

799
01:32:28,826 --> 01:32:32,026
Now Winston was in a very difficult position.

800
01:32:32,026 --> 01:32:40,746
Only one week before, Mussolini had replied to a letter from
Winston in a way that was not very friendly.

801
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:44,866
But now the situation had changed for Britain.

802
01:32:44,906 --> 01:32:56,186
Britain's ally, France, was probably going to surrender to
Germany, and the BEF was in terrible danger.

803
01:32:56,186 --> 01:33:02,546
Winston did not like the idea of approaching Mussolini, and
he did not think it would succeed.

804
01:33:02,546 --> 01:33:08,426
He was worried that, if Britain approached Mussolini, this
could lead to peace talks with Hitler.

805
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:20,586
He did not want Britain to be in a weak position "in which we went to... Mussolini and invited him to go to... Hitler
and ask him to (act) nicely".

806
01:33:20,626 --> 01:33:27,666
But he had to think about what was best for the British
people, so he agreed that perhaps they should consider it.

807
01:33:27,666 --> 01:33:36,266
If most British people had known that their leaders were considering making a peace agreement with a dictator, they
would have been shocked.

808
01:33:36,266 --> 01:33:44,306
But the newspapers often reported false information, so people believed that Britain and the Allies were winning the
war.

809
01:33:44,306 --> 01:33:47,386
Everything depended on what France was going to do.

810
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:53,586
If France surrendered, Britain would be in a much weaker
position, and Winston had to consider that.

811
01:33:53,586 --> 01:34:03,586
If France was not going to continue fighting, it was still important for Britain that France stayed in the war as long
as possible.

812
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:07,506
The BEF needed the French army to support them and help them
escape safely.

813
01:34:07,586 --> 01:34:11,346
But nobody knew if Britain would succeed in evacuating its
troops.

814
01:34:11,386 --> 01:34:18,866
If the BEF was destroyed, Britain would have no army to
defend it, and it would be in the same weak position as
France.

815
01:34:18,906 --> 01:34:30,746
So, on 26th May, after a four-hour meeting, Winston agreed that Halifax could write a paper suggesting how to approach
Mussolini, which the War Cabinet would discuss the next day.

816
01:34:30,746 --> 01:34:35,546
Halifax went happily away to write his paper.

817
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:40,906
But meanwhile, Winston was thinking hard about how the
British army could be saved.

818
01:34:40,906 --> 01:34:46,666
The big question was - how could the troops be safely
evacuated back to Britain?

819
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:57,066
More than 300,000 British troops were about to arrive at Dunkirk, but the British navy ships could not get close
enough to the beach to protect them because of air attacks by the

820
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:57,546
Luftwaffe.

821
01:34:57,546 --> 01:35:02,907
General Ironside had said that he thought only ten per cent
of the men could be saved.

822
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:14,627
President Roosevelt once said about Winston, "He has a hundred ideas a day. Four are good, the other ninety-six...
dangerous." Six days before, at the meeting of the War Cabinet

823
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:18,267
on 20th May, Winston had had an excellent idea.

824
01:35:18,267 --> 01:35:29,227
He had suggested that the Admiralty could collect a large number of small boats to sail across the English Channel to
Dunkirk and bring back the British troops of the BEE They

825
01:35:29,227 --> 01:35:33,187
could do this by asking ordinary people who owned boats for
help.

826
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:41,107
Winston had contacted an old friend who had worked for the Admiralty and asked him to put out a public call for boats
on national radio.

827
01:35:41,107 --> 01:35:46,227
There were now 800 little ships waiting to sail across the
English Channel to Dunkirk.

828
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:55,947
Winston knew that the plan was taking a huge risk with the lives of ordinary people, but if the British army could be
saved, then Britain could continue fighting.

829
01:35:56,027 --> 01:36:05,107
So, on 26th May, Winston hurried to the Admiralty, and at
6.57 p.m. he gave the order for the boats to start sailing.

830
01:36:05,147 --> 01:36:16,987
At the same time, he sent another telegram to Brigadier Nicholson at Calais, informing him again of the decision not
to evacuate and saying his men must continue to "fight to the

831
01:36:16,987 --> 01:36:17,387
end".

832
01:36:17,387 --> 01:36:20,347
Nicholson and his brave men followed their orders.

833
01:36:20,347 --> 01:36:31,267
They refused to surrender and continued fighting until the last moment, when the German flag was raised above the tower
in the Hotel de Ville, the most important building in

834
01:36:31,267 --> 01:36:31,707
Calais.

835
01:36:31,747 --> 01:36:36,787
Then they were led out of the building with their hands
above their heads and a line of German guns pointing at
them.

836
01:36:36,787 --> 01:36:41,507
They were sent to prisoner- of-war camps for the rest of the
war.

837
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:46,627
Sadly, Nicholson died three years later when he fell out of
a window at his camp.

838
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:54,027
Anthony Eden described the decision not to evacuate
Nicholson and his men as "one of the most painful of the
war".

839
01:36:54,027 --> 01:36:57,147
Winston, too, felt terribly sad.

840
01:36:57,147 --> 01:37:03,187
He had ordered 2,000 men to fight to the end in the hope of
saving several hundred thousand others.

841
01:37:03,187 --> 01:37:10,707
At dinner at Admiralty House that evening with Eden, Ismay
and Ironside, he was unusually silent.

842
01:37:10,707 --> 01:37:12,067
CHAPTER NINE

843
01:37:12,107 --> 01:37:12,907
Dark days

844
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:22,787
Winston had many things to think about - Nicholson and his brave men at Calais, Halifax and Mussolini, and the hundreds
of little boats sailing through the

845
01:37:22,787 --> 01:37:24,427
night across the Channel to Dunkirk.

846
01:37:24,427 --> 01:37:34,867
The next morning, 27th May, at 7.15 a.m., he received some
worrying news from the British navy in Dover.

847
01:37:34,907 --> 01:37:46,307
According to this message, "a bad situation is developing between Calais and Dunkirk. The enemy have (brought) forty
guns as far as Gravelines (the small town between Calais and

848
01:37:46,307 --> 01:37:58,787
Dunkirk)... and are (destroying ships) approaching Dunkirk..." If the small boats could not reach the harbour
to collect the British soldiers, the BEF would soon be surrounded by

849
01:37:58,787 --> 01:38:01,427
the German army, with no way to escape.

850
01:38:01,467 --> 01:38:07,347
Halifax was busy preparing the paper about a possible peace
agreement for his colleagues.

851
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:12,507
But when he arrived at the 11.30 a.m. meeting of the War
Cabinet, he also had some bad news.

852
01:38:12,547 --> 01:38:24,507
He had learned from the Belgian Embassy in London that the king of Belgium, King Leopold III, was considering
surrendering to Germany and making a separate peace agreement with

853
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:24,947
Hitler.

854
01:38:24,987 --> 01:38:29,827
Winston immediately sent a message to the Belgian king,
asking him not to do that.

855
01:38:29,867 --> 01:38:39,108
The Belgian army was in the north of France, fighting beside
the BEF, although they did not know that there was a plan to evacuate the British soldiers.

856
01:38:39,108 --> 01:38:46,868
If the Belgian army surrendered and stopped fighting at that moment, it would be very easy for the Germans to attack the
BEF from the north.

857
01:38:46,948 --> 01:38:57,188
The British ambassador in Washington had sent a telegram to Halifax, suggesting that perhaps Britain could give some of
its colonies in the New World to America to pay for war

858
01:38:57,188 --> 01:38:58,188
equipment.

859
01:38:58,188 --> 01:39:02,068
Halifax was ready to consider this idea, but Winston
refused.

860
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:08,188
He said that the US had given Britain very little help, and
Britain might need those colonies itself.

861
01:39:08,188 --> 01:39:17,748
He then asked his military leaders to examine the idea "of our continuing the war alone against Germany and probably
Italy" before the next meeting of the War Cabinet.

862
01:39:17,748 --> 01:39:26,268
This meeting, which was a very important one, happened later
that afternoon, at 4.30 p.m.

863
01:39:26,308 --> 01:39:37,588
There were usually twenty people at War Cabinet meetings, but at this meeting there were only eight - Winston,
Halifax, Chamberlain, Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood (the

864
01:39:37,588 --> 01:39:48,668
Labour MPs), Sir Alexander Cadogan (Halifax's close colleague in the Foreign Office), Sir Archibald Sinclair
(the Liberal Party leader and an old friend of Winston's) and Sir

865
01:39:48,668 --> 01:39:52,468
Edward Bridges, who recorded what happened at War Cabinet
meetings.

866
01:39:52,468 --> 01:40:00,148
There was only one subject to discuss - whether to approach Mussolini about a possible peace agreement, as Halifax had
suggested.

867
01:40:00,148 --> 01:40:10,068
The day before, the French prime minister, Paul Reynaud, had sent a message suggesting that the governments of Britain
and France should approach Mussolini together.

868
01:40:10,108 --> 01:40:16,468
Halifax had written down his ideas in a paper that he had
already sent to the people at the meeting.

869
01:40:16,508 --> 01:40:26,468
He suggested telling Mussolini that, if he made a peace agreement with Britain and France, both countries would do
their best to help Italy.

870
01:40:26,468 --> 01:40:33,468
Halifax also said that President Roosevelt had already
written to Mussolini about this but had not received an
answer.

871
01:40:33,468 --> 01:40:36,948
Everybody at the meeting gave their opinions, one by one.

872
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:45,708
Sir Archibald Sinclair and the two Labour MPs were very much
against the idea of approaching Mussolini.

873
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:56,308
Like Winston, they were afraid that an agreement with Mussolini could be seen as a first step to peace talks
between Britain and Germany.

874
01:40:56,308 --> 01:41:01,468
Then Winston said there was no purpose in approaching
Mussolini.

875
01:41:01,468 --> 01:41:10,308
He did not believe that France was ready to surrender, but
even if this happened, Britain would not go down with
France.

876
01:41:10,308 --> 01:41:20,308
The best help Britain could give to Reynaud, said Winston, was to show him that "we were going to fight it out to the
end".

877
01:41:20,308 --> 01:41:30,428
At the moment, many people in Europe believed that Britain was in a very weak position, and the only way to change
their minds was "by showing the world that Germany had not

878
01:41:30,428 --> 01:41:31,228
beaten us".

879
01:41:31,228 --> 01:41:42,028
If Britain approached Mussolini to talk about peace, said Winston, this would have no purpose and could even be a
disaster for Britain.

880
01:41:42,028 --> 01:41:53,828
If the worst happened, and Britain was beaten in the war, "it would not be a bad thing for this country to go down
fighting for other countries" that the Nazis had attacked and

881
01:41:53,828 --> 01:41:55,348
invaded.

882
01:41:55,348 --> 01:42:02,588
Winston and Halifax had not agreed with each other many
times in the past, and now it was happening again.

883
01:42:02,628 --> 01:42:07,108
It was clear that Winston had very different ideas from
Halifax.

884
01:42:07,108 --> 01:42:16,429
Halifax felt very surprised and frustrated because, the day before, Winston had thought it might be possible to approach
Mussolini.

885
01:42:16,429 --> 01:42:22,989
However, it now seemed that he had changed his mind and was
strongly against it.

886
01:42:23,029 --> 01:42:27,109
Halifax could not understand what Winston was trying to do.

887
01:42:27,149 --> 01:42:35,469
Like Winston, he loved his country very much, and he really believed that a peace agreement was the best hope for
Britain.

888
01:42:35,469 --> 01:42:43,229
He did not want more young people to lose their lives in war, and he did not believe that peace talks would be a
danger or a disaster.

889
01:42:43,229 --> 01:42:50,829
But almost everyone else in the room was on Winston's side,
and Halifax found himself alone.

890
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:56,069
The only person to support him was his friend and colleague
Chamberlain.

891
01:42:56,109 --> 01:42:59,709
Winston knew that he had to be careful about Halifax.

892
01:42:59,709 --> 01:43:05,429
Halifax was the Foreign Secretary, and many Conservative MPs
supported him.

893
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:11,669
He needed to keep Halifax on his side, because some people
were still not confident that Winston was a good leader.

894
01:43:11,669 --> 01:43:16,949
If Halifax decided to resign, they could turn against
Winston.

895
01:43:16,949 --> 01:43:25,309
Then the Conservative MPs would form two groups - those who
supported peace and those who were against it.

896
01:43:25,309 --> 01:43:32,189
This would be very bad for Britain at a time when it was important for all the members of the government to work
together.

897
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:44,789
So now, Winston said that, although he would not join France in asking for a peace agreement, if he was told what the
results of that agreement were, he would be ready to consider

898
01:43:44,789 --> 01:43:45,389
them.

899
01:43:45,429 --> 01:43:48,749
Once again, it seemed that Winston had changed his mind.

900
01:43:48,789 --> 01:43:54,149
The War Cabinet sent a message to Reynaud, agreeing that the
French could approach Mussolini.

901
01:43:54,149 --> 01:44:01,269
After the meeting, Halifax asked Winston if he could speak
to him privately in the garden of Number 10, Downing Street.

902
01:44:01,269 --> 01:44:14,269
As Halifax was leaving the room, he said to his colleague Alexander Cadogan, "I can't work with Winston anymore." In
the garden, Halifax said he was thinking of resigning, but

903
01:44:14,269 --> 01:44:18,429
Winston said he was sorry and persuaded him to stay in his
job.

904
01:44:18,429 --> 01:44:25,469
Later that day, at 7 p.m., there was another meeting to
discuss the latest news from France.

905
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:30,589
The BEF was in an even worse situation and was retreating to
the coast.

906
01:44:30,589 --> 01:44:35,629
Winston told the War Cabinet that Britain had done
everything possible to support its allies.

907
01:44:35,629 --> 01:44:43,749
However, the French military leaders had made some serious
mistakes, and the Belgian government had also been very
weak.

908
01:44:43,749 --> 01:44:49,949
They had not wanted Belgium to enter the war and had not
allowed British and French soldiers to enter Belgium.

909
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:57,829
When the German army invaded Belgium, there were no troops
to stop them, so now the BEF was in a dangerous position.

910
01:44:57,869 --> 01:45:04,869
Later, Winston received news that King Leopold III of
Belgium had approached the Germans to discuss surrendering.

911
01:45:04,869 --> 01:45:10,589
When Winston told the War Cabinet this, they felt sorry for
King Leopold III.

912
01:45:10,589 --> 01:45:15,109
The Belgian government, not the king, were responsible for
what had happened.

913
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:20,229
The government had left Belgium, but the king had stayed in
his country with his troops to support him.

914
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:27,469
The Minister of Information, Duff Cooper, advised Winston to
tell the British people about the BEF's true situation.

915
01:45:27,469 --> 01:45:36,749
He said that the public did not know what was really going on in the war, because the newspapers mostly reported only
positive things about what was happening in France.

916
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:44,949
If people knew the truth they would be shocked, but it would
also prepare them for more bad news if and when it came.

917
01:45:44,949 --> 01:45:53,910
Winston agreed to give a speech to Parliament in a week's time and returned to Admiralty House with his private
secretary, Jock Colville.

918
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:56,750
He worked till midnight, then went up to bed.

919
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:59,470
He had a lot of things to think about.

920
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:01,070
Was Halifax right?

921
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:03,150
Was he himself wrong?

922
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:08,470
Had he done the right thing for Britain in not allowing
Halifax to move forward with his peace plan?

923
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,950
What was the best thing to do now?

924
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:16,630
Halifax described Tuesday 28th May as "a very black day".

925
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:22,990
News came that the Belgian army had surrendered at 4 a.m.
that morning.

926
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:32,230
At the 11.30 a.m. meeting of the War Cabinet, Winston read out the important parts of the peace agreement between
Belgium and Germany:

927
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:34,190
1.

928
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:37,110
The Belgian troops were not allowed to move.

929
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:44,070
They had to stand by the side of the road in a line, waiting
for orders and holding white signs and flags.

930
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,510
2.

931
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:47,670
No war equipment could be destroyed.

932
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:48,270
3.

933
01:46:48,270 --> 01:46:52,590
The way to the coast had to be open for German troops.

934
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:53,310
4.

935
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:57,310
The way to Ostend had to be open, and nothing was to be
destroyed.

936
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:57,990
5.

937
01:46:58,070 --> 01:47:01,550
If the Belgians refused to follow orders, they would be
punished.

938
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:06,030
Meanwhile, large numbers of British troops had begun to
arrive at Dunkirk.

939
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:18,790
A report was received from Dover that 11,400 British soldiers had arrived there the night before and that another
2,500 men were already on their way across the Channel.

940
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:27,550
There were 2,000 soldiers waiting on the beaches of Dunkirk to be evacuated and 7,000 in the hills of sand behind the
beaches.

941
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:34,750
The British Royal Air Force were protecting the soldiers,
but the Luftwaffe had destroyed many of the British planes.

942
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:44,150
Winston made a short speech on the national radio news at
1p.m. and spoke to Parliament later that afternoon.

943
01:47:44,150 --> 01:48:00,430
He said that the British and French armies were in a
dangerous situation, and that the Belgian army had
surrendered.

944
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:03,990
But the troops were fighting well and were "in good heart".

945
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:10,470
Winston's political colleagues were very happy about his
speech, and many people thanked him afterwards.

946
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:16,710
At 4 p.m. that afternoon, the War Cabinet met again with the
same eight people as the day before.

947
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:24,550
Halifax spoke first and said that President Roosevelt had received an answer from Mussolini, but it had not been
helpful.

948
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:31,310
Meanwhile, the French had sent a stronger message, asking
for Britain and France to approach Mussolini together.

949
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:38,190
Winston was very much against this idea, and he and Halifax
argued about it for a long time.

950
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:49,790
Halifax, supported by Chamberlain, could not understand what was wrong with the idea of asking Mussolini to act in
possible peace talks between Britain and Germany.

951
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:59,710
Chamberlain said that, if Britain could keep its independence and if the important parts of the peace
agreement looked good, it should be ready to consider it.

952
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:09,350
Winston refused to accept this, and the meeting finished at
6.15 p.m., still with no decision made about peace talks.

953
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:17,390
Earlier that day, Winston had asked for a meeting with the twenty-five other ministers who were not part of the War
Cabinet.

954
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:26,111
He had not had a chance to speak to them about Britain's situation since he became prime minister, and he knew that
some of them were still not happy about him as leader.

955
01:49:26,111 --> 01:49:36,071
Winston knew that if Halifax, his Foreign Secretary, was no longer going to support him, he needed his full Cabinet of
ministers on his side.

956
01:49:36,071 --> 01:49:41,471
As Winston walked over to Parliament, he thought carefully
about what he was going to say.

957
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:44,751
The ministers were all waiting for him in his office.

958
01:49:44,751 --> 01:49:49,551
As he entered, they became silent, afraid of what he was
going to tell them.

959
01:49:49,551 --> 01:49:51,431
What was going to happen?

960
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:53,671
Was the British army destroyed?

961
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,991
Was Hitler going to invade?

962
01:49:55,991 --> 01:50:00,031
Were they going to lose their homes, families and way of
life?

963
01:50:00,031 --> 01:50:06,191
Winston told the ministers that he had decided to prepare
the British people for bad news.

964
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:17,151
Some people would say that the situation in Northern France "would be the greatest British military defeat for many
centuries" and "we must now be prepared for the sudden turning

965
01:50:17,151 --> 01:50:18,631
of the war against this island".

966
01:50:18,631 --> 01:50:29,191
The British people must not be told that France could soon surrender, but if this happened, said Winston, it would be
"easier to defend this island alone than to defend this

967
01:50:29,191 --> 01:50:30,631
island plus France".

968
01:50:30,631 --> 01:50:40,071
He added that, if Britain was going to fight on alone, it was possible that the United States could enter the war on
Britain's side.

969
01:50:40,071 --> 01:50:44,151
Winston spoke in a very positive way about Britain's
military forces.

970
01:50:44,271 --> 01:50:51,431
He said that although the Germans would probably try to
invade Britain, this would be very difficult for them.

971
01:50:51,431 --> 01:51:02,511
The British navy was extremely strong, the air force was very well organized, and Britain had enough food and oil and
very good troops, with help from troops in countries in the

972
01:51:02,511 --> 01:51:03,391
British Empire.

973
01:51:03,391 --> 01:51:07,311
British factories were also busy producing more planes.

974
01:51:07,351 --> 01:51:13,151
Winston also said that he had considered making a peace
agreement with Hitler, but there was no good reason for
this.

975
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:21,231
The Germans would then be able to take Britain's navy and many other things, so it was better for Britain to continue
fighting.

976
01:51:21,231 --> 01:51:29,671
If the time had come for Britain's "long island story" to finish, that would only happen "when each one of us lies...
in his own blood upon the ground".

977
01:51:29,671 --> 01:51:34,391
Winston spoke from his heart and proved again that he was an
excellent speaker.

978
01:51:34,431 --> 01:51:43,031
He had made it clear that he was not going to support Halifax's ideas of peace, even though he was risking the
chance of Halifax resigning.

979
01:51:43,071 --> 01:51:49,591
He had decided to return to his own first idea - that it was
better to fight on.

980
01:51:49,591 --> 01:51:55,791
This great speech by Winston brought all his ministers on to
his side.

981
01:51:55,831 --> 01:51:59,311
Several jumped up and ran around the table to thank him.

982
01:51:59,311 --> 01:52:07,711
When the War Cabinet met again, at 7 p.m. that evening, Winston told them what had happened and that all the
ministers were supporting him.

983
01:52:07,711 --> 01:52:16,151
Halifax and Chamberlain realized that Winston had beaten them, and they never mentioned the idea of a peace agreement
between Britain and Germany again.

984
01:52:16,151 --> 01:52:24,711
Winston was very happy because he knew that his political
colleagues supported him and felt confident about him.

985
01:52:24,711 --> 01:52:38,191
Before he went to bed, he called Paul Reynaud, the French prime minister, to say that, if necessary, Britain would
continue fighting alone, although he hoped the French would not

986
01:52:38,191 --> 01:52:39,151
surrender.

987
01:52:39,151 --> 01:52:40,471
CHAPTER TEN

988
01:52:40,471 --> 01:52:42,071
"Fight on the beaches"

989
01:52:42,071 --> 01:52:47,311
The next morning, 29th May, Winston received some good news.

990
01:52:47,311 --> 01:52:54,711
Prime Minister Reynaud was feeling much better because
Winston's message the evening before had greatly encouraged
him.

991
01:52:54,791 --> 01:52:59,552
Winston realized that the strongest weapon he had to save
Britain was hope.

992
01:52:59,552 --> 01:53:10,112
He immediately sent a message to his ministers, telling them always to use positive and encouraging words when speaking
to their friends and colleagues about the war.

993
01:53:10,152 --> 01:53:22,232
At 11.30 a.m., the War Cabinet met again, but this time Halifax did not try to change the minds of Winston or other
ministers.

994
01:53:22,272 --> 01:53:31,752
He said he had received a telegram from the British ambassador in Rome, who said that Italy was definitely going
to enter the war soon, but it was not certain when.

995
01:53:31,792 --> 01:53:45,472
The ambassador had told the Italian government that although
Britain did not want war with Italy, "if Italy made war, war would be met with war", and Mussolini alone would be

996
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,992
responsible for this.

997
01:53:46,992 --> 01:54:01,472
The War Cabinet was also told about the latest news from Dunkirk, which was not good. 40,000 British troops had
arrived in England from France, but the military leaders did not

998
01:54:01,472 --> 01:54:03,752
think that it was possible to save many more.

999
01:54:03,792 --> 01:54:13,592
The Luftwaffe had bombed Dunkirk and destroyed the harbour and several ships so that now other ships could not enter
the harbour.

1000
01:54:13,592 --> 01:54:26,632
Lord Gort, the man in charge of the BEF, had sent a telegram asking what the British government wanted him to do if all
hope was lost and he could no longer contact them.

1001
01:54:26,632 --> 01:54:36,272
Winston said he had ordered Lord Gort to continue attacking the German army for as long as possible to allow the British
troops more time to escape from Dunkirk.

1002
01:54:36,272 --> 01:54:44,752
But Halifax was not happy with this and said that, if Lord Gort wanted to retreat to save the lives of his own men,
they should allow him to do this.

1003
01:54:44,792 --> 01:54:52,632
Clement Attlee, the Labour leader, said that Lord Gort was an experienced soldier who could judge the situation for
himself.

1004
01:54:52,632 --> 01:54:58,792
So if the War Cabinet could no longer contact him, they
should allow him to make his own decisions.

1005
01:54:58,792 --> 01:55:05,792
Winston and the other members of the War Cabinet agreed, and
after the meeting, Winston sent a telegram to Lord Gort.

1006
01:55:05,792 --> 01:55:17,112
As soon as Winston came out of the meeting, he contacted his closest colleagues to say that it was very important to
evacuate French troops as well as British from Dunkirk.

1007
01:55:17,112 --> 01:55:27,992
That evening, after dinner with General Ironside and Clemmie at Admiralty House, he sent a telegram to Reynaud repeating
that he wanted to evacuate as many French troops as

1008
01:55:27,992 --> 01:55:28,712
possible.

1009
01:55:28,752 --> 01:55:38,312
He said that, after the troops had arrived back in Britain, and the people of Britain had prepared themselves for a
possible attack, they could start building up a new BEF.

1010
01:55:38,312 --> 01:55:47,952
As Winston was going to bed, one of the officers working for the War Cabinet asked for four days' holiday so he could go
to Dunkirk and help evacuate the troops.

1011
01:55:47,952 --> 01:55:52,832
Winston immediately agreed and said, "I wish I were going
with you myself."

1012
01:55:52,832 --> 01:55:58,232
The next day, there was fog at Dunkirk, so the Luftwaffe
could not continue bombing the harbour, but

1013
01:55:58,232 --> 01:56:01,432
now it was only possible for small boats to enter it.

1014
01:56:01,432 --> 01:56:06,312
Two men arrived in London to inform Winston about the latest
situation.

1015
01:56:06,312 --> 01:56:15,792
He was very surprised to see that one of them was a young relative of his, John Spencer- Churchill, who was very wet
and wearing his full battle uniform.

1016
01:56:15,792 --> 01:56:23,312
He told Winston that the greatest need was for "small boats to get the troops off the beaches and out to the bigger
ships".

1017
01:56:23,312 --> 01:56:30,112
The other man added that Lord Gort also believed that small
boats could save the troops.

1018
01:56:30,112 --> 01:56:48,793
At the next meeting of the War Cabinet, at 5.30 p.m., Winston announced that 100,000 British soldiers had arrived
back on the English coast, but the fog was causing problems and

1019
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:52,113
making it very difficult to evacuate more troops.

1020
01:56:52,113 --> 01:57:00,073
Meanwhile, General Weygand, who was fighting with the French army near the River Somme, had asked if Britain could send
more soldiers to help him.

1021
01:57:00,113 --> 01:57:02,353
Winston replied that Britain would send help as soon as it
could, but at the moment this was not possible.

1022
01:57:02,353 --> 01:57:04,633
Winston always wanted to see things for himself so he could
learn what was happening.

1023
01:57:04,633 --> 01:57:12,353
So he suggested that, the next day, he could go to Paris with the aim of explaining Britain's situation to Reynaud
and the French leaders.

1024
01:57:12,393 --> 01:57:23,833
He very much wanted French troops to be evacuated from Dunkirk with the BEE At 8.30 a.m. on the morning of 31st
May, Winston left London, together with General Ismay and the

1025
01:57:23,833 --> 01:57:25,553
Labour leader Clement Attlee.

1026
01:57:25,553 --> 01:57:34,153
As their plane flew over France, they saw crowds of ordinary people trying to move away from the line of fighting as
quickly as possible.

1027
01:57:34,153 --> 01:57:41,073
At the meeting, Winston informed the French leaders that
165,000 men had now arrived in England.

1028
01:57:41,073 --> 01:57:55,633
But Reynaud said that, although 150,000 of the 220,000 British troops in Holland, Belgium and France had been
evacuated, only 15,000 of the 200,000 French troops had been

1029
01:57:55,633 --> 01:57:56,273
evacuated.

1030
01:57:56,273 --> 01:58:02,313
He said that if more French troops were not able to escape,
French public opinion could turn against the British.

1031
01:58:02,313 --> 01:58:12,393
Winston replied that the British government had ordered the BEF to evacuate, and he had come to France to make sure the
French troops had received the same orders.

1032
01:58:12,393 --> 01:58:18,993
Reynaud thanked the British military forces for the
wonderful job they had done in evacuating the troops in
Dunkirk.

1033
01:58:18,993 --> 01:58:30,793
However, he was certain that Germany would soon attack the French troops in the south and asked if the British could
send fighter planes to protect them, together with soldiers.

1034
01:58:30,833 --> 01:58:37,633
Winston said this would not be possible until he knew how
many British troops had arrived safely back in Britain.

1035
01:58:37,673 --> 01:58:42,673
He tried to make Reynaud feel stronger and more positive
about the situation.

1036
01:58:42,673 --> 01:58:53,873
He said that the British people were not afraid of an attack by the Germans, and were ready to fight them in every small
village, but to do this, they needed soldiers to help them.

1037
01:58:53,873 --> 01:59:03,593
Winston said it was very important for Britain and France to work closely together if they were going to succeed in
beating the enemy, and even if one country was beaten, the

1038
01:59:03,593 --> 01:59:05,273
other had to continue fighting.

1039
01:59:05,273 --> 01:59:10,633
Clement Attlee supported Winston and said he agreed with
everything he had said.

1040
01:59:10,673 --> 01:59:22,433
Attlee added that the British people now realized the danger and that, if the Germans won the war, "everything they had
built up would be destroyed" because "the Germans killed

1041
01:59:22,433 --> 01:59:24,473
not only men, but ideas".

1042
01:59:24,473 --> 01:59:34,313
After the meeting, the British ambassador to France sent a message to Halifax saying that Winston's visit to France had
been extremely valuable.

1043
01:59:34,313 --> 01:59:39,473
Other people in London heard about the meeting, too, and
were happy it had gone well.

1044
01:59:39,473 --> 01:59:49,673
At the meeting of the War Cabinet the next day, 1st June, Winston announced that almost 225,000 troops had now arrived
in Britain from Dunkirk.

1045
01:59:49,673 --> 02:00:02,153
Halifax met with the American ambassador, Joseph Kennedy, who said that the American government thought that the
British military forces had done a great job in evacuating the

1046
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:07,713
troops, and it was a good chance for Winston to ask
President Roosevelt again for warships to help Britain.

1047
02:00:07,713 --> 02:00:15,714
However, bad news came - the fog had disappeared at Dunkirk, so the Luftwaffe were able to start bombing the harbour
again.

1048
02:00:15,714 --> 02:00:22,674
Seventeen ships were destroyed, including four valuable
warships, and ten more ships were badly hit.

1049
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:28,234
But Winston said that the ships must continue to evacuate
the troops for as long as possible.

1050
02:00:28,274 --> 02:00:36,674
Some British people and MPs were beginning to lose hope because the newspapers were reporting on Hitler's plans to
invade Britain.

1051
02:00:36,714 --> 02:00:48,194
Also, Britain had lost a lot of its equipment, the French had lost 80 percent of their army, and many French people
felt that Britain had not supported France enough.

1052
02:00:48,194 --> 02:00:58,594
So Duff Cooper, Minister of Information, spoke on national radio to give the British people the good news that 276,030
troops had arrived safely in England.

1053
02:00:58,594 --> 02:01:07,674
By noon on 3rd June, the news was even better, as 292,380
troops had come back.

1054
02:01:07,674 --> 02:01:14,754
It was time for Winston to speak to Parliament and the
British people again, but he had not finished writing his
speech.

1055
02:01:14,754 --> 02:01:24,274
He knew that it was very important to speak from his heart and encourage the British people to stay positive about the
war, even when there was bad news.

1056
02:01:24,274 --> 02:01:31,034
When writing, Winston would try several words and groups of
words before choosing which were the best.

1057
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:43,954
He would read the speech again and again, and make changes with a red pencil, then practise it while walking around the
room, speaking sometimes softly and sometimes loudly At

1058
02:01:43,954 --> 02:01:52,354
3.40 p.m. on 4th June 1940, Winston made one of the best and
most famous speeches of his life.

1059
02:01:52,354 --> 02:02:04,314
He started by describing the situation in France over the past weeks and was able to give the good news that now
330,000 troops had arrived safely home.

1060
02:02:04,314 --> 02:02:12,714
Winston spoke about the terrible crimes of the Nazis and the brave actions of those who had lost their lives defending
Dunkirk.

1061
02:02:12,714 --> 02:02:24,114
He said that Hitler was probably planning to invade Britain, but he also reminded people that Napoleon and other
dictators over the centuries had never succeeded in this.

1062
02:02:24,114 --> 02:02:34,114
He said that he was very confident that the British people would again prove themselves "able to defend our island
home" and would never surrender to a dictator.

1063
02:02:34,114 --> 02:02:40,114
This was what everyone in Parliament and the British
government had decided, together with the British people.

1064
02:02:40,154 --> 02:02:52,554
Britain and France would help each other to defend their countries to the end, and although much of Europe had fallen
to the Nazis, Britain would never lose heart.

1065
02:02:52,594 --> 02:03:08,154
"We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight... in the
air, we shall defend our island... we shall fight on the

1066
02:03:08,154 --> 02:03:16,634
beaches... we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,
we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender..."

1067
02:03:16,634 --> 02:03:21,514
In this speech, Winston touched the hearts and minds of

1068
02:03:21,514 --> 02:03:24,674
Parliament and the British public.

1069
02:03:24,754 --> 02:03:34,674
By using the word "we" so many times, he gave the British people the strong message they needed - that they would not
be alone, but that he would be with them, at their side,

1070
02:03:34,674 --> 02:03:41,234
every step of the way, ready to fight to the death if
necessary.

1071
02:03:41,234 --> 02:03:49,435
Afterwards, Winston said that the people of Britain had the heart of a lion, and all he had done was to give them a
voice.

1072
02:03:49,435 --> 02:04:04,635
When he made this speech, Winston had been prime minister for only twenty-five days, and during that time, he had met
some difficult problems, not only because of the war but also

1073
02:04:04,635 --> 02:04:08,195
from some of his own political colleagues.

1074
02:04:08,195 --> 02:04:11,275
But now everyone was ready to support him.

1075
02:04:11,315 --> 02:04:19,755
Although the future was not certain, at that moment, in
their darkest hour, he brought hope to the people of Britain.
