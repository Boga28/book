CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,560
Mr Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,200
I have just returned from a visit to my 
landlord, Mr Heathcliff. I am delighted  

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,840
with the house I am renting from him. Thrushcross 
Grange is miles away from any town or village.  

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,840
That suits me perfectly. And the scenery 
here in Yorkshire is so beautiful!

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
Mr Heathcliff, in fact, is my only neighbour,  

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,680
and I think his character is similar to 
mine. He does not like people either.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,080
'My name is Lockwood,' I said, when 
I met him at the gate to his house.  

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,720
'I'm renting Thrushcross Grange from you. I 
just wanted to come and introduce myself.'

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,120
He said nothing, but frowned, and 
did not encourage me to enter.  

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,760
After a while, however, he 
decided to invite me in.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,600
'Joseph, take Mr Lockwood's horse!' he called. 
'And bring up some wine from the cellar!'  

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
Joseph was a very old servant, 
with a sour expression on his face.  

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,160
He looked crossly up at me as he took my horse.

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,880
'God help us! A visitor!' he muttered to himself. 
Perhaps there were no other servants, I thought.  

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
And it seemed that Mr Heathcliff 
hardly ever received guests.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,640
His house is called Wuthering Heights. The 
name means 'a windswept house on a hill',  

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,360
and it is a very good description. The 
trees around the house do not grow straight,  

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
but are bent by the north wind, which 
blows over the moors every day of the year.  

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Fortunately, the house is strongly built, and 
is not damaged even by the worst winter storms.  

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,520
The name 'Earnshaw' is cut into 
a stone over the front door.

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Mr Heathcliff and I entered the huge main room. It 
could have been any Yorkshire farmhouse kitchen,  

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,880
except that there was no sign of cooking, 
and no farmer sitting at the table.  

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Mr Heathcliff certainly does not look like 
a farmer. His hair and skin are dark, like a  

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,200
gipsy's, but he has the manners of a gentleman. He 
could perhaps take more care with his appearance,  

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,080
but he is handsome. I think 
he is proud, and also unhappy.

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,880
We sat down by the fire, in silence.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,200
'Joseph!' shouted Mr Heathcliff. No answer 
came from the cellar, so he dived down there,  

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
leaving me alone with several 
rather fierce-looking dogs.  

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,800
Suddenly one of them jumped angrily up at me, and 
in a moment all the others were attacking me. From  

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,880
every shadowy corner in the great room appeared 
a growling animal, ready to kill me, it seemed.

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:42,000
'Help! Mr Heathcliff! Help!' I shouted, trying to 
keep the dogs back. My landlord and his servant  

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,040
were in no hurry to help, and could not have 
climbed the cellar steps more slowly, but luckily  

34
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,200
a woman, who I supposed was the housekeeper, 
rushed into the room to calm the dogs.

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,760
'What the devil is the matter?' Mr Heathcliff 
asked me rudely, when he finally entered the room.

36
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:14,320
'Your dogs, sir!' I replied. 'You shouldn't 
leave a stranger with them. They're dangerous.'

37
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,240
'Come, come, Mr Lockwood. Have some wine.  

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,840
We don't often have strangers here, and I'm afraid 
neither I nor my dogs are used to receiving them.'

39
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,040
I could not feel offended after this, and 
accepted the wine. We sat drinking and talking  

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,840
together for a while. I suggested visiting him 
tomorrow. He did not seem eager to see me again,  

41
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:55,840
but I shall go anyway. I am interested in 
him, even if he isn't interested in me.

42
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,200
Two days later Yesterday afternoon 
was misty and bitterly cold,  

43
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,840
but I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights 
and arrived just as it was beginning to snow.  

44
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,360
I banged on the front door for ten 
minutes, getting colder and colder.  

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Finally Joseph's head appeared at a 
window of one of the farm buildings.

46
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
'What do you want?' he growled.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
'Could you let me in?' I asked desperately.

48
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,640
He shook his head. 'There's only Mrs Heathcliff 
indoors, and she won't open the door to you.'

49
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,680
Just then a young man appeared and called me to 
follow him. We went through the back door and  

50
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,280
into the big room where I had been before. I was 
delighted to see a warm fire and a table full of  

51
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,840
food. And this time there was a woman sitting by 
the fire. She must be Mrs Heathcliff, I thought.  

52
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,960
I had not imagined my landlord was married. She 
looked at me coldly without saying anything.

53
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,840
'Terrible weather!' I remarked. There was silence.

54
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,640
'What a beautiful animal!' I tried again, 
pointing to one of the dogs that had attacked me.  

55
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,520
She still said nothing, but got up to make 
the tea. She was only about seventeen, with  

56
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,720
the most beautiful little face I had ever seen. 
Her golden wavy hair fell around her shoulders.

57
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
'Have you been invited to 
tea?' she asked me crossly.

58
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,760
'No, but you are the proper 
person to invite me,' I smiled.

59
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,280
For some reason this really annoyed her. She 
stopped making the tea, and threw herself  

60
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,200
angrily back in her chair. Meanwhile the 
young man was staring aggressively at me.  

61
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,320
He looked like a farm worker, but 
seemed to be part of the family.  

62
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,120
I did not feel at all comfortable. 
At last Heathcliff came in.

63
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,840
'Here I am, sir, as I 
promised!' I said cheerfully.

64
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,080
'You shouldn't have come,' he answered, 
shaking the snow off his clothes.  

65
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
'You'll never find your way back in the dark.'

66
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
'Perhaps you could lend me a servant to 
guide me back to the Grange?' I asked.

67
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:56,080
'No, I couldn't. There aren't any servants 
here except Joseph and the housekeeper. Get  

68
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,640
the tea ready, will you?' he added fiercely to the 
young woman. I was shocked by his unpleasantness.

69
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,840
We sat down to eat. I tried to make conversation 
with the three silent people round the table.

70
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,440
'How happy you must be, Mr Heathcliff,' I began, 
'in this quiet place, with your wife and-'

71
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,840
'My wife! My wife's ghost, you mean?'

72
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,120
I suddenly realized I had made a 
serious mistake. So his wife was dead!  

73
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Of course he was too old to be married to that 
young girl. She must be married to the young  

74
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,640
man next to me, who was drinking his tea out of 
a bowl and eating his bread with unwashed hands.  

75
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,040
Perhaps the poor girl had found no one better to  

76
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,160
marry in this uninhabited area. I 
turned politely to the young man.

77
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:07,840
'Ah, so you are this lady's husband!' This was 
worse than before. His face went red, and he  

78
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,480
seemed only just able to stop himself hitting 
me. He muttered something I could not hear.

79
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,640
'Wrong again, Mr Lockwood,' said Mr 
Heathcliff. 'No, her husband, my son,  

80
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:35,840
is dead. This, 'he added', looking scornfully 
at the young man, 'is certainly not my son.'

81
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,000
'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' 
growled the young man.

82
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,560
We finished our meal in silence, 
and when I looked out of the window,  

83
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
all I could see was darkness and snow.

84
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,520
'I don't think I can get home without a 
guide,' I said politely. No one answered me.  

85
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,680
I turned to the woman.

86
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,000
'Mrs Heathcliff,' I begged, 
'What can I do? Please help me!'

87
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
'Take the road you came on,' 
she replied without interest,  

88
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,880
opening a book. 'That's the 
best advice I can give.'

89
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,440
'Mr Heathcliff, I'll have to stay 
here for the night!' I told him.

90
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,120
'I hope that will teach you not to 
walk over the moors in bad weather,'  

91
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:40,800
he answered. 'I don't keep guest bedrooms. 
You can share a bed with Hareton or Joseph.'

92
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,960
I was so angry with them all that I could not stay 
there a moment longer, and rushed out into the  

93
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,400
darkness. I saw Joseph by the back door, caught 
hold of the lamp he was carrying, and ran with  

94
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,280
it to the gate. But the dogs chased after me and 
attacked me, and I was soon knocked to the ground.  

95
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Heathcliff and Hareton 
stood at the door, laughing,  

96
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,360
as I shouted at the dogs and tried to get up. In 
the end I was again rescued by the housekeeper,  

97
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Zillah, who ordered away the 
dogs and helped me to my feet.

98
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,160
I was so bruised and exhausted that I 
did not feel strong enough to walk home,  

99
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,080
and although I did not want to, I had 
to spend the night at Wuthering Heights.  

100
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:41,840
Nobody wished me goodnight, as Zillah 
took me upstairs to find a bed for me.
 
 

101
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,160
CHAPTER TWO

102
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Catherine Earnshaw's room

103
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,120
'Quietly, sir!' whispered the housekeeper, 
as we climbed up the dark stairs.  

104
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,120
'My master will be angry if he discovers 
which bedroom you're sleeping in.  

105
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,840
For some reason he doesn't 
want anyone to sleep there,  

106
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,160
I don't know why. They're strange people in 
this house, you know. Here's the room, sir.'

107
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,840
But I was too tired to listen.

108
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,520
'Thank you, Zillah,' I said, and, taking the 
candle, I entered the room and closed the door.

109
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,840
The only piece of furniture in the large, dusty 
bedroom was a bed, placed next to the window.  

110
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,880
There were heavy curtains which could be pulled 
around it, to hide the sleeper from anyone else  

111
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,600
in the room. Looking inside the curtains I saw a 
little shelf full of books, just under the window.  

112
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:03,760
I put my candle down on the shelf, and dropped 
thankfully on to the bed. I closed the curtains  

113
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,560
around the bed, and felt safe from Heathcliff 
and everyone else at Wuthering Heights.

114
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,280
I noticed that there were names written on the 
wall in childish handwriting - Catherine Earnshaw,  

115
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,080
Catherine Heathcliff and Catherine Linton.  

116
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:37,360
Then I fell asleep, but I was woken very suddenly 
by a smell of burning. My candle had fallen on to  

117
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,880
a Bible on the shelf and was burning it. When 
I opened the Bible to see if it was damaged,  

118
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,160
I found that wherever there was an empty page, 
or half a page, someone had written on it,  

119
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,840
and on the first page was written 
'Catherine Earnshaw's diary, 1776'.  

120
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Who was the girl who had slept in this 
bed, written her name on the wall,  

121
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:17,520
and then written her diary in the Bible, 
twenty-five years ago? I read it with interest.

122
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,920
'How I hate my brother Hindley!' it 
began. 'He is so cruel to poor Heathcliff.  

123
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,120
If only my father hadn't died! While he 
was alive, Heathcliff was like a brother  

124
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,840
to Hindley and me. But now Hindley and his wife 
Frances have inherited the house and the money,  

125
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,800
and they hate Heathcliff. That horrible old 
servant Joseph is always angry with Heathcliff  

126
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,200
and me because we don't pray or study the Bible,  

127
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:10,880
and when he tells his master, Hindley always 
punishes us. I can't stop crying. Poor Heathcliff!  

128
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,680
Hindley says he is wicked, and can't 
play with me or eat with me anymore.'

129
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,240
My eyes were beginning to 
close again and I fell asleep.  

130
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Never before had I passed such a terrible 
night, disturbed by the most frightening dreams.  

131
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,080
Suddenly I was woken by a gentle knocking on 
the window. It must be the branch of a tree, I  

132
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:49,440
thought, and tried to sleep again. Outside I could 
hear the wind driving the snow against the window.

133
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,360
But I could not sleep. The knocking annoyed 
me so much that I tried to open the window.  

134
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,040
When it did not open, I broke the glass angrily 
and stretched out my hand towards the branch.  

135
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,560
But instead, my fingers closed around a small,  

136
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:22,560
ice-cold hand! It held my hand tightly, and 
a voice cried sadly, 'Let me in! Let me in!'

137
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,760
'Who are you?' I asked, 
trying to pull my hand away.

138
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,840
'Catherine Linton,' it replied. 
'I've come home. I lost my way!'  

139
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
There seemed to be a child's 
face looking in at the window.

140
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Terror made me cruel. I rubbed 
the creature's tiny wrist  

141
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,480
against the broken glass so that 
blood poured down on to the bed.  

142
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,520
As soon as the cold fingers let go for a moment, 
I pulled my hand quickly back, put a pile of  

143
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,600
books in front of the broken window, and tried 
not to listen to the desperate cries outside.

144
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,160
'Go away!' I called. 'I'll never let you in, 
not if you go on crying for twenty years!'

145
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,160
'It is almost twenty years!' 
replied the sad little voice.  

146
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:42,080
'I've been out here in the dark for nearly 
twenty years!' The hand started pushing through  

147
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
the window at the pile of books, and I knew 
it would find me and catch hold of me again.  

148
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:59,840
Unable to move, I stared in horror at 
the shape behind the glass, and screamed.

149
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,640
There were rapid footsteps 
outside my bedroom door,  

150
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,000
and then I saw the light of a candle in the room.

151
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,760
'Is anyone here?' whispered Heathcliff. He 
could not see me behind the curtains, and  

152
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,920
clearly did not expect an answer. I knew I could 
not hide from him, so I opened the curtains wide.

153
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,560
I was surprised by the effect of my action. 
Heathcliff dropped his candle and stood  

154
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:41,840
without moving, his face as white as the wall 
behind him. He did not seem to recognize me.

155
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,040
'It's only your guest, Lockwood,' I said.  

156
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,120
'I'm sorry, I must have had a bad 
dream and screamed in my sleep.'

157
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,720
'To the devil with you, Mr Lockwood!'  

158
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,040
growled my landlord. 'Who allowed you 
to steep in this room? Who was it?'

159
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,920
'It was your housekeeper, Mr Heathcliff,' 
I said, quickly putting my clothes on.  

160
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,880
'And I'm angry with her myself! No one 
can sleep in a room full of ghosts!'

161
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,520
'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, looking 
suddenly very interested. 'Ghosts, you say?'

162
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,040
'That little girl, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, 
or whatever her name was, must have been wicked!  

163
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,080
She told me she had been a 
ghost for nearly twenty years.  

164
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
It was probably a punishment for her wickedness!'

165
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,920
'How dare you speak of her to 
me?' cried Heathcliff wildly.  

166
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,920
But as I described my dream, he became calmer,  

167
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,360
and sat down on the bed, trembling 
as he tried to control his feelings.

168
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,360
'Mr Lockwood,' he said finally, 
brushing a tear from his eye,  

169
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:28,160
'you can go into my bedroom to sleep for the 
rest of the night. I'll stay here for a while.'

170
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
'No more sleep for me tonight,' I replied.  

171
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,480
'I'll wait in the kitchen until it's daylight, 
and then I'll leave. You needn't worry about  

172
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,480
my visiting you again either. I've 
had enough company for a long time.'

173
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,400
But as I turned to go downstairs, my landlord, 
thinking he was alone, threw himself on the bed,  

174
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,720
pushed open the window and 
called into the darkness.

175
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:11,120
'Come in! Come in!' he cried, 
tears rolling down his face.  

176
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,800
'Catherine, do come! My 
darling, hear me this time!'

177
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,560
But only the snow and wind blew into the room.

178
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
How could my dream have produced such madness?  

179
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,840
I could not watch his suffering 
any more, and went downstairs.

180
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,560
I waited in the kitchen until it was light enough 
outside for me to find my way through the deep  

181
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:55,840
snow back to Thrushcross Grange. The housekeeper 
there, Ellen Dean, rushed out to welcome me home.  

182
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,960
She thought I must have died in 
the previous night's snowstorm.  

183
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:11,840
With a warm fire, and a hot meal, I began 
to recover from my unpleasant experiences.

184
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,200
After my stay at Wuthering Heights, 
I thought I would never want to speak  

185
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:26,160
to any human being again, but by the end of 
the next day I was beginning to feel lonely.  

186
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,000
I decided to ask Mrs Dean 
to sit with me after supper.

187
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,000
'How long have you lived in 
this house?' I asked her.

188
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:48,240
'Eighteen years, sir. I came here early in 1783 
when my mistress was married, to look after her.  

189
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,840
And when she died, I stayed here as housekeeper.'

190
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
'Who was your mistress?' I asked.

191
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
'Her name was Catherine Earnshaw,' she replied.

192
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,240
'Ah, my ghostly Catherine,' 
I muttered quietly to myself.

193
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,240
'She married Mr Edgar Linton, a neighbour,'  

194
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,960
added Mrs Dean, 'and they had a daughter, 
Cathy, who married Mr Heathcliffs son.'

195
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,840
'Ah, so that must be the widow, young 
Mrs Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights!'

196
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,920
'That's right, sir. Did you see her? I 
looked after her as a baby, you know.  

197
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,840
How is she? I do want to know.'

198
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,720
'She looked very well, and very 
beautiful. But I don't think she's happy.'

199
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,320
'Oh, poor thing! And what did 
you think of Mr Heathcliff?'

200
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:15,360
'He's a rough, hard man, Mrs Dean. But I'm very 
interested in him. Tell me more about him.'

201
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,280
'Well, he's very rich, of course, 
and mean at the same time.  

202
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,160
He could live here at Thrushcross Grange, which 
is a finer house than Wuthering Heights, but he  

203
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:40,560
would rather receive rent than live comfortably. 
But I'll tell you the whole story of his life,  

204
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:48,000
as much as I know, that is, and 
then you can judge for yourself.'
 
 

205
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,520
CHAPTER THREE

206
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,840
Ellen Dean's story - Catherine 
and Heathcliff as children

207
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,560
When I was a child, I was always at Wuthering 
Heights, because my mother was a servant with  

208
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,600
the Earnshaw family. They are a very old family 
who have lived in that house for centuries,  

209
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,880
as you can see from their name on the 
stone over the front door. I grew up  

210
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,160
with Catherine and Hindley Earnshaw, and 
we three played together as children.

211
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,360
One day, their father Mr Earnshaw came 
back from a long journey. He had travelled  

212
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,320
sixty miles to Liverpool and back 
on business, and was very tired.

213
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,080
'Look what I've brought you!' he told us all, 
unwrapping something he was holding carefully  

214
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,360
in his arms. Catherine and Hindley were expecting 
presents, and they rushed eagerly to see what it  

215
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:09,840
was. They were very disappointed to see 
only a dirty, black-haired gipsy child.

216
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,160
'I found him all alone in the 
busy streets of Liverpool,'  

217
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,320
Mr Earnshaw explained to them, and I couldn't 
leave him to die. He can sleep in your room.'  

218
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,600
But Hindley and Catherine were angry 
because they had not received any presents,  

219
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,880
and refused to let the strange child share 
their room. However Mr Earnshaw insisted,  

220
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:46,320
and little by little the boy became 
accepted by the family. He was called  

221
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,600
Heathcliff, as a first and last name. No one 
ever discovered who his parents had been.

222
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,120
Catherine and he became great friends, but 
Hindley hated him, and was often cruel to him.  

223
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,160
Old Mr Earnshaw was strangely fond of this 
gipsy child, and frequently punished his son for  

224
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:20,320
behaving badly to Heathcliff. Hindley began to be 
jealous of his father's feelings for Heathcliff,  

225
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
and saw them both as enemies.

226
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
This situation could not last. 
As Mr Earnshaw grew old and ill,  

227
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,920
Heathcliff became even more his favourite, 
and Hindley often quarrelled with his father.  

228
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,400
When Hindley was sent away to study, I hoped 
that we would have peace in the house. But then  

229
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,120
it was that old servant Joseph who caused 
trouble. He tried to persuade his master  

230
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,600
to be stricter with the children, and was 
always complaining that Heathcliff and Catherine  

231
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,560
did not spend enough time studying the 
Bible or attending church services.

232
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
Catherine was a wild, wicked girl in those days.  

233
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,280
We had to watch her every moment of the day, to 
stop her playing her tricks on us. She was proud,  

234
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:23,120
and liked giving orders. But she had the prettiest 
face and the sweetest smile you've ever seen.  

235
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
I could forgive her anything when 
she came to say she was sorry.

236
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,240
She was much too fond of Heathcliff, and the 
worst punishment we could invent was to keep  

237
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,400
her separate from him. Her father could 
no longer understand her or her behaviour,  

238
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,240
and Catherine did not realize that his 
illness made him less patient with her.

239
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:59,920
At last Mr Earnshaw found peace. He died quietly 
in his chair by the fire one October evening in  

240
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:09,040
1775. The night was wild and stormy, and we 
were all sitting together in the big kitchen.  

241
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,440
Joseph was reading his Bible at the table, while 
Catherine had her head on her father's knee.  

242
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,840
He was pleased to see her so gentle for 
once, and she was singing him to sleep.  

243
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,240
I was glad the old gentleman was sleeping so well.  

244
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,320
But when it was time to go to bed, Catherine put 
her arms round her father's neck to say goodnight,  

245
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,760
and immediately screamed, 'Oh, 
he's dead, Heathcliff! He's dead!'

246
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,000
Heathcliff and I started 
crying loudly and bitterly too.  

247
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,480
Joseph told me to fetch the doctor, so I ran to 
the village, although I knew it was too late.  

248
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,640
When I came back, I went to the children's room,  

249
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:12,320
to see if they needed me, and I listened for 
a moment at their door. They were imagining  

250
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,960
the dead man in a beautiful distant place, 
far from the troubles of this world.  

251
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:28,160
And as I listened, crying silently, I could not 
help wishing we were all there safe together.
 
 

252
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,520
CHAPTER FOUR

253
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,160
Catherine Earnshaw gets to know the Lintons

254
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:48,400
1775 Hindley came home for his father's burial.  

255
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:58,560
What was more surprising was that he brought a 
wife with him. She was called Frances, a thin,  

256
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,600
pale woman with a frequent cough. Now 
that Hindley was the master of the house,  

257
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,280
he ordered Joseph and me to spend our evenings in 
the small back-kitchen, as we were only servants,  

258
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:21,600
while he, his wife and Catherine sat in the 
main room. Catherine and Heathcliff were  

259
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,560
treated very differently. Catherine received 
presents, and could continue her lessons,  

260
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,480
but Heathcliff was made to work on the farm with 
the men, and, as a farm worker, was only allowed  

261
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:45,440
to eat with us in the back-kitchen. They grew up 
like two wild animals. Hindley did not care what  

262
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:54,000
they did, as long as they kept out of his way, and 
they did not care even if he punished them. They  

263
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,360
often ran away on to the moors in the morning and 
stayed out all day, just to make Hindley angry.  

264
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,440
I was the only one who cared what happened to the 
two poor creatures, and I was afraid for them.

265
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:18,880
One Sunday evening they were missing at bedtime, 
and Hindley ordered me angrily to lock the front  

266
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,200
door. But I did not want them to stay out in the 
cold all night, so I kept my window open to look  

267
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:36,080
out for them. In a while I saw Heathcliff walking 
through the gate. I was shocked to see him alone.

268
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,160
'Where's Catherine?' I cried sharply.

269
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,120
'At Thrushcross Grange, with our neighbor's the 
Lintons,' he replied. Let me in, Ellen, and I'll  

270
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,200
explain what happened.' I went down to unlock 
the door, and we came upstairs very quietly.

271
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,880
'Don't wake the master up!' 
I whispered. 'Now tell me!'

272
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,200
'Well, Catherine and I thought we'd just 
walk to the Lintons' house. We wanted to  

273
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,920
see if Isabella and Edgar Linton are punished 
all the time by their parents, as we are.'

274
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,360
'Probably not,' I answered. 'I expect they are 
good children and don't need to be punished.'

275
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:35,360
'Nonsense, Ellen! Guess what we saw when we looked 
in at their sitting-room window? A very pretty  

276
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:43,040
room, with soft carpets and white walls. Catherine 
and I would love to have a room like that!  

277
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:51,840
But in the middle of this beautiful room, Isabella 
and Edgar Linton were screaming and fighting  

278
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:01,600
over a little dog! How stupid they are, Ellen! 
If Catherine wanted something, I would give it  

279
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,200
to her, and she would do the same for me. I would 
rather be here at Wuthering Heights with her, even  

280
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,400
if I'm punished by Joseph and that wicked Hindley, 
than at Thrushcross Grange with those two fools!'

281
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,160
'Not so loud, Heathcliff! But you still 
haven't told me why Catherine isn't with you?'

282
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:35,440
'Well, as we were looking in, we started laughing 
at them so loudly that they heard us, and sent the  

283
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:44,560
dogs after us. We were about to run away, when 
a great fierce dog caught Catherine's leg in its  

284
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:52,480
teeth. I attacked it, and made it let go of 
her leg, but the Lintons' servants appeared  

285
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,840
and caught hold of me. They must have thought we 
were robbers. Catherine was carried unconscious  

286
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,960
into the house, and they pulled me inside too. 
All the time I was shouting and swearing at them.

287
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:16,080
"What a wicked pair of thieves!" said 
old Mr Linton. "The boy must be a gipsy,  

288
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,320
he's as dark as the devil!" 
Mrs Linton raised her hands in  

289
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,840
horror at the sight of me. Catherine opened 
her eyes, and Edgar looked closely at her.

290
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:40,320
"Mother," he whispered, "the young lady is Miss 
Earnshaw, of Wuthering Heights. I've seen her in  

291
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,640
church occasionally. And look what our dog 
has done to her leg! It's bleeding badly!"

292
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:57,840
"Miss Earnshaw with a gipsy!" cried Mrs Linton. 
"Surely not! But I think you must be right, Edgar.  

293
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,160
This girl is wearing black, and Mr 
Earnshaw died recently. It must be her.  

294
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,320
I'd better put a bandage on her leg at once."

295
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,600
"Why does her brother Hindley let her run around 
with such a companion?" wondered Mr Linton. "I  

296
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,040
remember now, he's the gipsy child Mr Earnshaw 
brought home from Liverpool a few years ago."

297
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,640
"He's a wicked boy, you can 
see that," said Mrs Linton.  

298
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,840
"And did you hear the bad language he used just 
now? I'm shocked that my children heard it."

299
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,960
I was pushed out into the garden, but I stayed to 
watch through the window. They put Catherine on a  

300
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:57,440
comfortable sofa, cleaned her wound and fed her 
with cakes and wine. I only left the house when  

301
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,720
I was sure she was well taken care of. She's a 
breath of fresh air for those stupid Lintons.

302
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,120
'I'm not surprised they like her. Everybody who 
sees her must love her, mustn't they, Ellen?'

303
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,080
'I'm afraid you'll be punished for 
this, Heathcliff,' I said sadly.

304
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,320
And I was right. Hindley warned 
Heathcliff that he must never  

305
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,400
speak to Catherine again, or he would 
be sent away from Wuthering Heights,  

306
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,160
and it was decided that Catherine would 
be taught to behave like a young lady.

307
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:44,960
She stayed with the Linton family at Thrushcross 
Grange for five weeks, until Christmas. By that  

308
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:54,160
time her leg was fine, and her manners were much 
better than before. Frances Earnshaw visited her  

309
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,880
often, bringing her pretty dresses to wear, and 
persuading her to take care of her appearance,  

310
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:08,320
so that when she finally came home after her long 
absence, she almost seemed a different person.  

311
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,160
Instead of a wild, hatless girl, we saw a 
beautiful, carefully dressed young lady.

312
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,720
When she had greeted all of 
us, she asked for Heathcliff.

313
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,680
'Come forward, Heathcliff!' called Hindley.  

314
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,160
You may welcome Miss Catherine 
home, like the other servants.'

315
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,000
Heathcliff was used to being outside all day, and 
had not bothered to wash or change his clothes.  

316
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,440
His face and hands were black with dirt.  

317
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,840
In spite of this, Catherine was very glad to see 
him and rushed up to kiss him. Then she laughed.

318
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:59,760
'How funny and black and cross you look! But 
that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella,  

319
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,760
who are always so clean and tidy. Well, 
Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'

320
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:15,200
But, ashamed and proud, the boy said nothing, 
until suddenly his feelings were too much for him.

321
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,080
'I won't stay to be laughed at!' he cried,  

322
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,720
and was about to run away, when 
Catherine caught hold of his hand.

323
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:35,600
'Why are you angry, Heathcliff? You... you just 
look a bit strange, that's all. You're so dirty!'

324
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,000
She looked worriedly at her 
hands, and her new dress.

325
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,640
'You needn't have touched me!' he said,  

326
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,800
pulling away his hand. 'I like being 
dirty, and I'm going to be dirty!'

327
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,480
As he ran miserably out of the room, 
Hindley and his wife laughed loudly,  

328
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,640
delighted that their plan to separate the 
two young people seemed to be succeeding.

329
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:13,440
The next day was Christmas Day. Edgar and 
Isabella Linton had been invited to lunch,  

330
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,600
and their mother had agreed, on condition that 
her darlings were kept carefully apart from that  

331
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,240
wicked boy. I felt sorry for poor Heathcliff,  

332
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,640
and while the Earnshaws were at church, I 
helped him wash and dress in clean clothes.

333
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,880
'You're too proud,' I scolded him as I 
brushed his black hair. You should think  

334
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,440
how sad Catherine is when you can't be 
together. And don't be jealous of Edgar Linton!'

335
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,360
'I wish I had blue eyes and fair hair like him!  

336
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,480
I wish I behaved well, and was 
going to inherit a fortune!'

337
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,840
'He has none of your intelligence or character!  

338
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,000
And if you have a good heart, 
you'll have a handsome face.  

339
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,400
Who knows who your parents were? Perhaps a king 
and queen, far more important than the Lintons!'

340
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,920
In this way I encouraged Heathcliff to have more 
confidence in himself. But when the Earnshaws  

341
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,920
and the Lintons arrived back from church, the 
first thing Hindley did was shout at Heathcliff.

342
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,840
'Get out of my sight, until we've finished eating!  

343
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,400
I'll pull that long hair of yours 
if you don't obey me at once!'

344
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,480
'It is long,' said Edgar. I'm surprised he can 
see anything.' This was too much for Heathcliff.  

345
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,560
He looked desperately around for a weapon, picked 
up a bowl of hot soup and threw it at Edgar,  

346
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,600
who started screaming. Hindley immediately took 
hold of Heathcliff and pushed him upstairs.

347
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,400
'I'm sure Hindley's going to hit him!' 
cried Catherine. 'I hate it when Heathcliff  

348
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,040
is punished! It's your fault, Edgar, you 
annoyed him! Why did you speak to him?'

349
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,320
'I didn't,' replied Edgar, tears in his eyes. 'I  

350
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,240
promised Mother I wouldn't. I 
spoke about him, not to him.'

351
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,280
'Well, don't cry,' said Catherine with scorn.  

352
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,440
'You've made enough trouble 
already. Here comes my brother.'

353
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,920
Hindley returned, hot and breathless.

354
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,360
'That'll teach him!' he said. 
'And now let's have lunch!'

355
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,800
The others seemed to forget Heathcliff, 
but I noticed Catherine could not eat much,  

356
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:11,520
and I knew she was sorry for her friend. In the 
evening there was music from a travelling band,  

357
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,000
and dancing in the main room. Catherine 
said the music sounded sweeter from high up,  

358
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:26,720
and so she went to sit in the dark on the stairs. 
When I went to find her, however, I discovered  

359
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,240
she had gone right to the top of the house to talk 
to Heathcliff through his locked bedroom door,  

360
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,840
and had then climbed out on to the roof and 
in through his window. I persuaded them both  

361
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,760
to come out of the room the same way, as I had 
no key to the door, and took Heathcliff down  

362
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,400
into the warm servants' kitchen with me, while 
Catherine returned to her guests and the dancing.

363
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,320
'You must be hungry, Heathcliff,' I said.  

364
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,120
'You haven't eaten all day. 
Have some Christmas cake, do.'

365
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,000
'I can't eat anything,' he growled, 
putting his head in his hands.  

366
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:18,720
'I've got to think how I can have my revenge 
on Hindley. I only hope he doesn't die first!  

367
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,960
He'll be sorry he's treated 
me like this, Ellen!'
 
 

368
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,320
CHAPTER FIVE

369
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,480
Catherine and Edgar

370
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:41,920
1778 In the summer of this year Hindley's 
wife Frances had her first, and last,  

371
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,840
baby. They called the boy Hareton. But the 
poor woman had been ill for a long time,  

372
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,800
although we had not realized it, and 
died soon after Hareton was born.

373
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:05,680
Hindley only had room in his heart for two 
people, himself and his wife, so when she died,  

374
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:14,560
he was in despair. He neither cried nor 
prayed. Instead he swore at God and man, and  

375
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:24,320
drank himself to sleep every night. The servants 
all left him, except for Joseph and me. Joseph  

376
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,200
enjoyed being able to scold his wicked 
employer, with warnings from the Bible,  

377
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,760
and I could not leave Miss Catherine. After 
all, I had grown up with her and Hindley.

378
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:43,440
But the master's behaviour was a bad example 
for Catherine and Heathcliff. At fifteen,  

379
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,560
Catherine was the most beautiful girl for miles 
around, but she was proud and quick-tempered.  

380
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:59,520
She led what was almost a double life. At 
Wuthering Heights, under Heathcliffs influence,  

381
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,720
she annoyed Hindley, laughed at Joseph, and 
was rude to me. But at Thrushcross Grange,  

382
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,760
which she often visited, she showed a different, 
calmer side of her character, and was polite,  

383
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,680
intelligent and amusing. The Lintons all liked 
her, and poor Edgar had fallen in love with her.

384
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,080
Heathcliff was sixteen at this time. He did 
not have time to study any more, and the long  

385
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:37,840
hours of work on the farm made him tired and dull. 
There was always an angry expression on his face,  

386
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:45,840
and he did not even try to keep himself clean and 
tidy. He seemed to want people to dislike him.  

387
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,640
Catherine and he still spent time together, when 
he was not working in the fields, but he no longer  

388
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,720
expressed his fondness for her in words, and 
he looked angry if she touched or kissed him.

389
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,760
One afternoon, when Hindley had gone into town,  

390
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,040
Heathcliff came into the main room after lunch. 
I was helping Catherine to arrange her hair,  

391
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,480
as she had invited Edgar Linton to 
visit her while Hindley was absent.

392
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,840
'Catherine, are you going 
anywhere this afternoon?'  

393
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,280
asked Heathcliff. 'Why have you got that silk 
dress on? Nobody's visiting you, I hope.'

394
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,360
'No-o, I don't think so,' replied Catherine,  

395
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,680
looking quickly at me. 'But you 
should be at work by now, Heathcliff.'

396
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:50,240
'That devil Hindley isn't away very often. I'm 
taking a holiday. I won't work anymore today.  

397
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm staying with you this 
afternoon. He'll never know.'

398
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:05,600
Catherine thought for a moment. 'Somehow she had 
to prepare him for Edgar's visit. Isabella and  

399
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:12,640
Edgar said they might call here this afternoon. 
If they come, you'll be scolded for not working.'

400
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,240
'Tell Ellen to say you're busy and can't 
see them,' he said. Those friends of yours  

401
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,120
take up all your time. You spend most of 
your evenings with them, not with me.'

402
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,840
'Well, why should I always spend my 
time with you?' she asked crossly.  

403
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,920
'What can you talk about? How can you amuse me?'

404
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,200
'You never told me before that you didn't 
like my company, Catherine!' cried Heathcliff.

405
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,480
Just then we heard a horse outside, and there was 
a light knock on the door. Edgar Linton entered,  

406
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,720
his handsome face full of delight at 
receiving Catherine's unexpected invitation.  

407
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:06,560
I wondered if Catherine was comparing her two 
friends, as Edgar came in and Heathcliff ran out.

408
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,440
'I haven't come too soon, 
have I?' asked Edgar politely.

409
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,800
'No,' answered Catherine. 'Leave us alone, Ellen.'

410
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,200
'I'm just doing my work, miss,' I 
replied, pretending to dust the furniture.  

411
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,440
'Hindley had told me to be present if 
Edgar Linton came to visit Catherine.'

412
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,680
She came up to me, and whispered crossly,  

413
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,840
'Go away, Ellen!' Keeping her back to 
Edgar, she cruelly scratched my arm.

414
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,480
'Oh!' I screamed, to show Edgar what had happened.  

415
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,520
'What a wicked thing to do, miss! 
You have no right to hurt me!'

416
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,400
'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!'  

417
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,960
she cried angrily, and, unable to 
control herself, hit me hard on the face.

418
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,840
'Catherine, love! Catherine!' 
cried Edgar, shocked.

419
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,840
The baby, Hareton, who followed me everywhere,  

420
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,720
immediately started sobbing and 
saying, 'Wicked aunt Catherine!'

421
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,600
She picked him up and shook the poor child 
until he screamed. Edgar rushed up to her  

422
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:37,680
and tried to stop her. At once she turned and 
hit him over the ear as hard as she could.

423
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,360
The young man looked very pale 
and went straight to the door.

424
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:53,840
'Where are you going, Edgar Linton?' she asked. 
'Don't leave me! I shall be miserable all night!'

425
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,720
'Can I stay after you have hit me?'  

426
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,160
he replied. 'You've made me afraid and 
ashamed of you. I won't come here again!'

427
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:14,800
'Well, go then, if you want to!' she 
cried. 'I'm going to cry until I'm ill!'  

428
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,640
and she dropped on to the floor, her shoulders 
shaking and the tears rolling down her face.

429
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,560
Edgar managed to get as far as the door.  

430
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:33,280
But here he hesitated, and I called 
out to him to encourage him to leave.

431
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,320
'Miss is just a selfish child, sir! 
You'd better ride home and forget her!'

432
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,440
But as he could not stop looking at her, I knew 
there was no hope for him. Nothing would keep  

433
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:58,160
him away from her now. And sure enough, he came 
back into the room and shut the door. This time  

434
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,600
I left them alone, and stayed in the kitchen with 
little Hareton, but when I came to warn them that  

435
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:12,720
Hindley had returned, I realized that their 
quarrel had only brought them closer together.

436
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,160
CHAPTER SIX

437
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,880
Heathcliff disappears

438
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:30,880
1778-9 Hindley came into the kitchen, swearing  

439
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,080
terribly, just as I was about to hide little 
Hareton in a cupboard. I was always afraid  

440
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:46,080
that Hindley would hurt his small son, either 
by accident or on purpose, when he was drunk,  

441
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:53,680
so I tried to keep Hareton out of the way. 
But this time Hindley discovered my plan.

442
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:04,640
'Ah, you keep my son in a cupboard, do you!' he 
cried angrily, picking up a sharp kitchen knife.  

443
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,840
'With the devil's help I'll make you swallow this, 
Ellen!' And he pushed the knife between my teeth.

444
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:22,080
I was never afraid he would hurt me, and 
calmly took the knife out of my mouth.

445
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,720
'But that can't be my son, can 
it?' he continued aggressively,  

446
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:39,920
staring at the frightened little boy. 'If it 
is, he should be punished for not running to  

447
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:48,400
greet his father. Perhaps I'll cut his ears 
off!' And then suddenly his manner changed.

448
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:58,960
'No, Hareton, darling, don't 
cry! Kiss me, kiss your father!  

449
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,240
What? You won't? Then I'll break your neck!'

450
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,520
Poor Hareton, screaming wildly, 
was carried upstairs by his father.  

451
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:21,760
Suddenly Hindley stopped on the stairs to 
listen, almost forgetting what he was holding.  

452
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:29,280
Heathcliff had come into the house and stood 
at the bottom of the stairs, looking up.  

453
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,760
Just then the child jumped out 
of Hindley's arms and fell.  

454
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,360
I only had time to gasp in horror, before 
I saw that Heathcliff had caught him.

455
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,720
Heathcliff stared down at 
the child he was holding.  

456
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,600
He must have felt sorry he had 
saved the life of his enemy's son.  

457
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,840
I rushed to take the poor little boy in my 
arms, and Hindley came slowly downstairs.

458
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:10,640
'Look what you've done, Mr Hindley!' I 
cried. 'You nearly killed your own son!  

459
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,480
What would his mother say if she were alive?'

460
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:26,800
'Take him away, Ellen. And you, Heathcliff, go 
away too. I won't murder you tonight, unless  

461
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:35,440
perhaps I set the house on fire. But that depends 
how I feel.' And he poured himself a drink.

462
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,480
'Don't drink any more, Mr Hindley!' I begged.

463
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:50,080
'What difference does it make?' he growled. 
'Get out, both of you! To the devil with you!'

464
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,920
We left him swearing at us, 
and went back into the kitchen.

465
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,560
'It's a pity he can't kill himself with drink,'  

466
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:06,800
muttered Heathcliff. Dr Kenneth says he'll 
live longer than any of us, he's so strong.'

467
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:17,520
He walked out of the door and, I thought, into 
the fields. In fact I discovered later that he  

468
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,360
was sitting just under the window, and could 
hear everything that was said in the kitchen.

469
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,840
I was singing little Hareton to 
sleep when Catherine came in.

470
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,520
'Are you alone, Ellen?' she 
whispered. 'Where's Heathcliff?'

471
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,040
'He's out on the farm,' I answered.

472
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:45,120
She looked sad and worried, and I 
even saw a tear or two on her face.  

473
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,360
But I had not forgotten how she had lied, and 
behaved so badly to me as well as to Edgar Linton,  

474
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,840
so I did not feel sorry for 
her, or encourage her to talk.

475
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:07,520
'Ellen, will you keep a secret for me?' she 
asked in the end, giving me her sweetest smile.  

476
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,720
'I must tell you! I need your advice.  

477
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,080
Today Edgar Linton has asked me to 
marry him, and I gave him an answer.  

478
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,480
Now, before I tell you if it was yes or 
no, you tell me which I should have said.'

479
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,240
'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know? 
Perhaps you should have refused him. He must  

480
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,480
be a fool to ask you, after you were 
so rude and violent this afternoon.'

481
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,680
'Well, I accepted him, Ellen!' she said crossly.  

482
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,640
But should I have done so? 
Should I? What do you think?'

483
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,000
'First, do you love him?' I asked.

484
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,000
'Of course I do,' she replied.

485
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,840
'Why do you love him, Miss Catherine?'

486
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:17,920
'Well, I do, that's enough. Well, because 
he's handsome, and a pleasant companion.'

487
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,040
'Oh, that's bad,' I said, shaking my head.

488
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,680
'And because he loves me.'

489
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,920
'That's worse.'

490
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:35,840
'And because he'll be rich, and I shall be 
the most important woman for miles around.'

491
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,680
'Worst of all. But there are several other  

492
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,080
handsome, rich young men in the world. 
Why don't you marry one of them?'

493
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,880
'I don't know any of them. I only know Edgar.'

494
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,360
'Well, I don't know why you're unhappy, Miss 
Catherine. Your brother will be pleased,  

495
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:06,400
and Mr Edgar's parents will, too. You love 
Edgar, and Edgar loves you. What's the problem?'

496
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:19,120
'Here! And here! replied Catherine, beating 
her head and her chest. 'In my heart and soul  

497
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:28,720
I know I'm wrong! Ellen, I can't live apart 
from Heathcliff! He is more myself than I am.  

498
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:38,000
Our souls are the same! I have nothing in common 
with Edgar. But I can't marry Heathcliff now!  

499
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:45,840
Hindley has made him become a poor, dull farm 
worker. He'll never know how I love him.'

500
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:54,720
I suddenly heard a movement outside the window, 
and saw Heathcliff stand up and walk away.  

501
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,760
I realized he had been listening until he 
heard Catherine say she could not marry him.  

502
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,880
Then he stayed to hear no more.

503
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:13,200
'Quiet, Miss Catherine!' I said. Just 
imagine how hard it will be for Heathcliff  

504
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,560
when you marry Mr Edgar! He'll have 
no friends at all when you leave him.'

505
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:28,160
'Leave him? Why should we be separated?' 
she asked angrily. 'Who will separate us?  

506
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:34,080
Nobody will dare! Edgar must 
learn to accept him as my friend.  

507
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,600
Didn't you ever think, Ellen, 
that if Heathcliff and I married,  

508
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:47,440
we would be very poor? But if I marry Edgar, I 
can help Heathcliff with my husband's money.'

509
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:56,800
'That's the worst reason you've given so far 
for marrying Mr Edgar,' I replied, shocked.

510
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,720
'It isn't! Heathcliff is more 
important to me than myself.  

511
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:11,200
My love for Edgar is like the leaves on 
the trees. I'm sure time will change it.  

512
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,520
But my love for Heathcliff is like the 
rocks in the ground - not beautiful,  

513
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:27,360
but necessary and unchanging. 
He's always, always in my heart-'

514
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,080
Just then Joseph entered the kitchen.  

515
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:39,440
I whispered to Catherine that I was sure 
Heathcliff had heard some of what she said.  

516
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:48,560
She jumped up, frightened, and rushed outside. But 
although we all looked everywhere for Heathcliff,  

517
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:54,240
there was no sign of him that night, 
or for many nights in the future.

518
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:04,080
At about midnight, while we were still waiting for 
him to come home, we noticed the wind was getting  

519
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:10,960
stronger. We could hear it whistling down the 
chimney, and howling all around the house.  

520
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:19,840
Suddenly there was a terrible crash of thunder, 
and the branch of a tree fell on to the roof.  

521
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,560
We were not hurt, but Joseph immediately 
dropped on to his knees to pray.  

522
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,720
The rain was beating down on the windows,  

523
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:38,720
but Catherine stayed outside, although by 
now her hair and clothes were completely wet.

524
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,400
In the end we all went to bed. I managed 
to persuade Catherine to come in,  

525
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:53,120
but she insisted on sleeping in the kitchen, 
in case Heathcliff returned during the night.  

526
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:02,880
In the morning we discovered that she had caught 
a fever, as a result of getting wet. She became  

527
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,280
seriously ill, and it was several weeks 
before Dr Kenneth would allow her out of bed.

528
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:19,360
When she recovered, she was invited to stay for 
a while at Thrushcross Grange. Unfortunately  

529
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:28,320
old Mr and Mrs Linton caught the fever too, and 
died within a few days of each other. Catherine  

530
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:35,120
returned to us, prouder and quicker-tempered 
than ever, but not as strong as before.

531
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:45,440
'If she gets ill again, it could be fatal,' 
Dr Kenneth warned us. 'My advice to you  

532
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:52,560
is to do whatever she wants, and don't 
make her angry!' So we had to obey  

533
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:57,840
all her orders, and Joseph and I were 
not allowed to scold her any more.

534
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:06,240
Edgar Linton was still in love with her, and 
thought himself the happiest man on earth when he  

535
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:13,840
married her three years after his parents' death. 
She insisted on having me with her, so we moved  

536
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:20,640
together to Thrushcross Grange, although I was 
very sad to leave little Hareton with his father.

537
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:26,240
It's very late, Mr Lockwood. 
I think you should go to bed,  

538
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,880
or you'll be ill tomorrow. I can tell 
you the rest of the story another time.

539
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:44,560
Four weeks later in fact I was ill the next day, 
and have been ill since then. The terrible night  

540
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:51,280
I spent at Wuthering Heights was the cause of 
my illness, and I blame Mr Heathcliff for it.  

541
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,440
Dr Kenneth has warned me I won't 
be able to go out until the spring.  

542
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:07,840
All I can do is lie in bed, listening to the 
howling wind and staring at the grey northern sky.

543
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:16,560
So I've decided to ask Mrs Dean to come 
upstairs and finish telling me her story.  

544
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,840
She tells me she's happy to continue.

545
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,120
CHAPTER SEVEN

546
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,440
Heathcliff returns

547
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:42,640
1783 Well, sir, when Miss Catherine became Mrs 
Linton, and we went to live at Thrushcross Grange,  

548
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,840
I must say I was surprised 
and pleased by her behaviour.  

549
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:53,920
She showed great fondness for her 
husband, and for his sister, Isabella.  

550
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:02,400
He, of course, was very anxious that no one 
should disobey her, or make her angry. If  

551
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,920
she was depressed for a time, he blamed it on 
the illness she had had, and was sympathetic.  

552
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:15,520
But for most of the time, I believe they 
shared a deep and growing love for each other.

553
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Unfortunately this happiness did not last. 
One evening I was bringing in a basket of  

554
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:33,200
apples from the garden, when a voice 
behind me said, 'Ellen, is that you?'

555
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,840
It was a deep, rather unusual voice.  

556
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:46,080
I turned, to see a tall, dark man 
in the shadow near the kitchen door.

557
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:52,000
'Don't you know me?' he asked. 
'Look, I'm not a stranger!'

558
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,760
'What!' I cried in surprise,  

559
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,720
for it had been four years since he 
disappeared. 'Heathcliff! Is it really you?'

560
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,480
'Yes,' he replied, looking up 
at the windows of the house.  

561
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,920
'Are they at home? Where is she? 
Tell me, Ellen! I must speak to her!'

562
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:25,200
'I'm not sure if you should see her,' I 
hesitated. 'Will the shock be too much for her?'

563
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:33,120
'Go and tell her I'm here, Ellen!' he said 
impatiently. 'Don't make me suffer like this!'

564
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,160
I left him at the door, and went upstairs to 
find Mr and Mrs Linton. They were sitting quietly  

565
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:50,320
together, looking out over the peaceful valley. 
The room, and the view, and the two people,  

566
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:58,400
seemed so calm that I did not want to disturb 
them. But I had to deliver my message.

567
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,680
'A man wants to see you, madam,' I muttered.

568
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,960
'I'll go downstairs and see 
him then,' replied Catherine.  

569
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,240
'Bring the tea up, Ellen, while 
I'm away.' She left the room.

570
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,480
'Who is it, Ellen?' asked Mr Edgar.

571
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:25,360
'It's that Heathcliff, sir. You remember, 
he used to live at Wuthering Heights.'

572
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,040
'What! The gipsy, who worked 
on the farm?' he cried.

573
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:36,720
'Mrs Linton would be angry if she heard 
you talking about him like that, sir.  

574
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:42,000
She was very upset when he ran away. 
She's very fond of him, you know.'

575
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,160
'Mr Edgar put his head out of the 
window and called to his wife,  

576
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,160
Don't stand there in the cold, love! Bring 
the person in, if it's anyone special.'

577
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,440
Catherine rushed upstairs and into the room,  

578
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:04,000
wild and breathless. She threw 
her arms round her husband's neck.

579
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,280
'Oh Edgar darling! Heathcliffs come back!'

580
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,680
'Well, well,' said Mr Edgar crossly, 
'there's no need to get excited.'

581
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:24,000
'I know you didn't like him,' she said, 'but 
please, I beg you to be friends with him now.  

582
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,720
Shall I ask him to come up?'

583
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,280
'You're suggesting inviting him up here,  

584
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,880
into our sitting room? Don't you think 
the kitchen is more suitable for him?'

585
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:44,560
Catherine looked at her husband, 
half angry and half laughing. 'No,'  

586
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:54,320
she said, 'I can't sit in the kitchen. Ellen, 
bring two tables, one for your master and Miss  

587
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:01,040
Isabella, the other for Heathcliff and myself. 
We'll sit apart from them, as we're of a lower  

588
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:08,080
class! Will that please you, Edgar darling? 
Decide quickly! I must have him near me!'

589
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,040
'Ellen, you go and bring him up,' said Mr Edgar.  

590
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,440
'And Catherine, try not to behave 
foolishly. Remember, he's only a servant!'

591
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,120
When Heathcliff entered the sitting-room, I 
was surprised to see how much he had changed.  

592
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:35,040
He wore a confident, intelligent expression on 
his face, and his manner was no longer rough.  

593
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:43,840
Although I recognized the same black fire in 
his eyes, the farm boy had become a gentleman.

594
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:51,520
Mr Edgar was as surprised as I was, but 
welcomed Heathcliff as politely as he could.  

595
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:58,080
However, he grew more and more annoyed 
as he watched his wife's delighted face.  

596
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,680
She could not take her eyes off Heathcliff.

597
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:09,920
'Tomorrow I won't be able to believe that 
I've seen and touched you, Heathcliff!'  

598
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,480
she cried, catching hold of his hands.  

599
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:20,800
But how cruel of you to run away and keep 
silent for four years, and never think of me!'

600
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:32,000
'I've thought of you more than you've thought of 
me,' he replied quietly. 'I heard you had married,  

601
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,840
Catherine, and I came, just to see you once, and 
then take my revenge on your brother Hindley.  

602
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:47,600
Your welcome may change my plans. You 
know, I've had a bitter, hard life  

603
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,840
since I last heard your voice, and if 
I've survived, it's all because of you!'

604
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:02,480
'Catherine,' said Mr Edgar, trying to remain 
polite, 'please pour out the tea, or it will  

605
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:10,000
be cold. Mr Heathcliff will have a long walk to 
wherever he's staying tonight, and I'm thirsty.'

606
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:17,520
But Catherine was too excited, and 
Mr Edgar too angry, to drink any tea.  

607
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:26,800
After a while their guest left. We discovered that 
he had been invited to stay at Wuthering Heights,  

608
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,840
by Hindley. I could not understand why 
Hindley, who hated him, would want his company,  

609
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:40,560
and I felt sure it would have been better for 
all of us if Heathcliff had never come back.

610
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,840
Catherine could not keep her happiness to herself.  

611
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,800
In the middle of the night she 
woke me to talk about Heathcliff.

612
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,680
'I just can't sleep, Ellen!' she said.  

613
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,040
And Edgar won't listen when I tell 
him how happy I am! He's so selfish!'

614
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:08,560
'He never liked Heathcliff,' I replied, 'and 
he'll be angry if you go on talking about him.  

615
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:16,240
You think he's weak, but he could be as determined 
as you, about something he thinks is important.'

616
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:25,280
'No!' she laughed. 'I have such confidence in 
Edgar's love that I think I could kill him,  

617
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:31,840
and he wouldn't blame me for it. He will have 
to learn to accept Heathcliff as my friend.'

618
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,160
'Do you know why Heathcliff is 
staying at Wuthering Heights?'

619
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:41,440
'Oh, yes. He explained that 
he went there to look for me.  

620
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:47,920
Hindley asked him to play cards, and when 
he discovered Heathcliff had a lot of money,  

621
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,520
invited him to stay there. You know how greedy 
my brother is. He'll make Heathcliff pay rent,  

622
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:02,400
and hope to win money from him at cards. 
Heathcliff wants to stay there to be near me.  

623
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:08,880
I'm so happy, Ellen! And I want 
everyone around me to be happy too!'

624
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:18,640
Catherine behaved so sweetly to her husband in 
the next few days that Thrushcross Grange seemed  

625
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:25,920
full of sunshine, and in spite of his doubts, Mr 
Edgar allowed Heathcliff to visit her regularly.  

626
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,880
However, Heathcliffs visits produced a 
result which none of us had expected.  

627
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:42,320
Isabella, Mr Edgar's sister, a pretty girl of 
eighteen, suddenly declared that she was in love  

628
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:51,440
with Heathcliff. Mr Edgar, who loved her dearly, 
was shocked. He knew that if he and Catherine had  

629
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:59,840
no sons, Isabella would inherit the considerable 
Linton fortune. He did not like the idea  

630
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:06,800
of the fortune passing to Heathcliff, as 
Isabella's husband. But more importantly,  

631
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:13,600
he suspected that Heathcliff was hiding his true 
wickedness under his gentlemanly appearance.

632
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:22,000
Catherine tried hard to persuade Isabella 
that Heathcliff was not worth loving,  

633
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,920
but poor Isabella was jealous of 
Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff  

634
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,800
and would not listen. Finally, Catherine 
told Heathcliff himself that Isabella  

635
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,880
was in love with him. She thought 
she knew what his answer would be.

636
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:48,160
'How could I ever love that stupid girl?' he 
asked. 'She has a miserable pale face, and weak  

637
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:56,320
blue eyes, just like your husband! But... she will 
inherit the family wealth from him, won't she?'

638
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,800
'That's true,' replied Catherine. 'But 
don't think about that, Heathcliff.  

639
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,560
I hope Edgar and I will have several 
sons, and then they will inherit it.'

640
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:17,920
Catherine did not speak of this matter again, 
but I am sure Heathcliff often thought about it.  

641
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:25,520
I watched him carefully in the next few days. 
I hoped he would do nothing to hurt Mr Edgar,  

642
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:32,080
who was a kind master to me. I was worried, too, 
about what was happening at Wuthering Heights.  

643
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,680
Hindley and his son Hareton 
seemed like lost sheep to me,  

644
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:47,840
and I knew there was a wicked wolf just 
waiting for the chance to attack them.
 
 

645
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,360
CHAPTER EIGHT

646
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,520
Catherine is ill

647
01:16:52,640 --> 01:17:00,720
1783 The next time Heathcliff 
came to Thrushcross Grange,  

648
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:08,720
he met Isabella by chance in front of the 
house. I was watching from the kitchen window,  

649
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,840
as he went up to her, and, supposing that 
no one else could see him, kissed her.

650
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,560
'Look, madam!' I cried to Catherine, 
who was passing through the kitchen.  

651
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,680
That devil Heathcliff told you he could never 
love Miss Isabella! And now he's kissing her!'

652
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:34,320
So when Heathcliff entered the house, 
Catherine was ready to scold him.

653
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,400
'Leave Isabella alone, Heathcliff!' 
she ordered. 'You'll make Edgar angry!'

654
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,960
'You think I'm afraid of 
that weak little creature?'  

655
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,440
he growled. 'Anyway, what 
difference does it make to you?  

656
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:58,960
I can kiss her if she likes it. I'm not 
your husband, you needn't be jealous of me!'

657
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,000
'I'm not jealous of you!' replied Catherine.  

658
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:12,000
'If you like Isabella, you can 
marry her. But do you like her?'

659
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,960
'It's you I want to talk about, Catherine.  

660
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,800
You know you've treated me badly. 
And I'm going to have my revenge!  

661
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,240
Thank you for telling me Isabella's 
secret. I swear I'll make good use of it!'

662
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,280
At this point I went to look for my master,  

663
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:40,000
and told him that Catherine and Heathcliff 
were quarrelling in the kitchen.

664
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,520
'How can my wife call that man a friend?'  

665
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:52,080
he cried angrily. I've been too weak with 
her. 'I can't allow him to visit her anymore.'

666
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,480
'Call two servants, Ellen.'  

667
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,680
He went to the kitchen. I followed him, 
telling the servants to wait in the hall.

668
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,080
'Catherine!' said Mr Edgar 
to his wife as he entered.  

669
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,360
'Do you think it's right to 
listen to this wicked man's talk?'

670
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,920
'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?'  

671
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:23,040
asked Catherine coldly. Heathcliff 
laughed, which made Mr Edgar even angrier.

672
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:33,200
'You, sir,' he said to Heathcliff, are poisoning 
our family life. I should never have accepted you  

673
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:40,320
as Catherine's friend. I must inform you that you 
will never be allowed to enter this house again,  

674
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,000
and that if you don't leave within 
three minutes, you will be thrown out.'

675
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,960
'Well, well!' replied Heathcliff, looking 
scornfully at Mr Edgar's small figure.  

676
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,960
'So, you're going to throw 
me out yourself, are you?'

677
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:10,240
My master looked towards the door. I realized he 
wanted to call the servants, as he knew he was  

678
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:15,920
not strong enough to fight Heathcliff alone. 
But Catherine must have guessed his plan.  

679
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,680
She hurried to the door and locked it. 
Mr Edgar looked at her in angry surprise.

680
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,400
'You must fight him like a gentleman,  

681
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:35,280
without anyone to help you!' she told her 
husband. 'That'll teach you to scold me!'

682
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,720
Mr Edgar tried to get hold of the key, 
but she threw it quickly into the hottest  

683
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:49,680
part of the fire. He went very pale, and 
could not stop his whole body trembling.

684
01:20:51,360 --> 01:21:00,400
'Oh Edgar!' cried his wife. 'You've lost the 
fight already! You aren't a man, you're a mouse!'

685
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:10,080
'So that,' said Heathcliff, pointing at Mr Edgar, 
'is the thing you preferred to me, Catherine.  

686
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,880
Is he crying, or is he going to die of fear?'

687
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,080
He went up to look more closely at Mr Edgar,  

688
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:26,960
who suddenly recovered and hit Heathcliff 
hard on the neck. While Heathcliff  

689
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:33,760
was getting his breath back, Mr Edgar walked 
out of the other kitchen door into the garden.

690
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,320
'Now you'll never be able to come here again,'  

691
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,800
said Catherine to Heathcliff. 'Go away 
quickly! He'll return with men and guns.'

692
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,520
Heathcliff was sensible enough to take her advice.  

693
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:56,400
He broke down the locked door and escaped, 
just as the master and his men returned.

694
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:02,720
Catherine, who was over-excited, 
ordered me to go upstairs with her.  

695
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,840
I hoped she would not discover that I had told 
Mr Edgar about her quarrel with Heathcliff.

696
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:18,400
'I'm wild with anger, Ellen!' she said, when we 
reached the sitting-room. 'All this trouble is  

697
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:26,560
because of Isabella! Tell Edgar I'm in danger 
of becoming seriously ill. I hope it's true,  

698
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:34,480
I want to frighten him. He's upset me badly. 
Why did he listen to us talking in the kitchen?  

699
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,000
Heathcliff says wicked things, 
but I know I can control him.  

700
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,640
Well, if I can't have Heathcliff as my friend, 
if Edgar is going to be mean and jealous,  

701
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:54,720
I'll try to break both their hearts by breaking 
my own. You must remind Edgar how quick tempered  

702
01:22:54,720 --> 01:23:01,440
I am, and what Dr Kenneth said about my 
health. Edgar must let me do what I want!'

703
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:11,040
I did not feel sympathetic towards Catherine, and 
certainly did not want to frighten my poor master  

704
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:17,040
by telling him she was ill. As I was 
leaving the room, however, he entered.

705
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:26,400
'Catherine,' he said, 'you must tell me 
one thing. You must choose between me  

706
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,600
and Heathcliff. Which do you intend to have?'

707
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,080
'Leave me alone!' she cried wildly.  

708
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:41,200
'I'm ill, can't you see, I can't 
even stand! Edgar, leave me!'

709
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:50,960
She fell, stiff and pale, on to the 
floor. Mr Edgar looked very frightened.

710
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,600
'Don't worry, sir,'  

711
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:01,840
I whispered to him. 'She told me she would try 
to make you afraid by pretending to be ill.'

712
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:10,800
Unfortunately she heard me. She jumped 
up, her hair loose and her eyes staring,  

713
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,840
and rushed to her bedroom. We 
heard the key turn in the lock.

714
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:25,440
For the next few days she refused to speak to 
anyone, even me. I took her food up to her room,  

715
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:33,040
but she would not eat. Mr Edgar spent his time 
in the library, and did not ask about his wife.  

716
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,720
He hoped, I suppose, that she would 
come and ask him to forgive her.  

717
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,840
But I knew she was too proud to do that.

718
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:51,440
On the third day she unlocked her door 
and called me. She ate and drank eagerly,  

719
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,560
then lay down again.

720
01:24:54,160 --> 01:25:04,160
'Oh, why don't I die, since no one cares about 
me!' she muttered. 'Edgar doesn't love me at all!  

721
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,400
What is he doing all this time, Ellen?'

722
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,920
'He's reading books in the 
library, madam,' I answered.

723
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:22,080
'Reading books!' she cried, 
shocked. 'And I'm dying up here!  

724
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:32,480
My God! Does he know how I've changed, how ill I 
am? Can't you tell him I'm seriously ill, Ellen?'

725
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:39,600
'You forget, Mrs Linton, that you've 
eaten tonight. I'm sure you'll feel  

726
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:46,480
better tomorrow morning.' I still wanted to 
make her realize how selfish she was being,  

727
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:54,000
although I was a little worried 
by her pale, almost ghostly face.

728
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:01,360
'I begin to see that you don't like me, Ellen. 
How strange! I always thought everybody loved me!  

729
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:13,440
Now they are all my enemies - Isabella and Edgar 
and you! I'll die with cold faces around me!  

730
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:21,840
I've had terrible dreams these past few nights, 
you know. Open the window, Ellen! I'm so hot!'

731
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:28,080
I refused, as it was the middle 
of winter. She was feverish.

732
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:37,920
'Who is that over there?' she asked, staring at 
her own face in a mirror opposite her bed. I could  

733
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:45,440
not make her understand it was herself, and I 
began to be afraid that her illness was real.

734
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:53,520
'Stay with me, Ellen,' she cried, holding 
my hand. 'I'm frightened of that face!  

735
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:02,240
I'm frightened of being alone! I wish I were 
in my bed at Wuthering Heights, with the wind  

736
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:10,000
howling through the trees. Do let me feel a 
breath of air from the moors, just one breath!'

737
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:18,720
I opened the window for a moment, then 
closed it. The cold air seemed to calm her.

738
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:26,880
'I wish I were a young girl again, wild 
and free, out on the moors with Heathcliff!  

739
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:33,040
Open the window again, wider 
this time! Why won't you?'

740
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,280
'Because I don't want you 
to die of cold,' I replied.

741
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:46,960
'But it's my only chance of life!' she cried, 
jumping out of bed and going to the window.  

742
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:53,920
I tried to force her back to bed, but 
her fever made her surprisingly strong.  

743
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:00,960
We looked out together into the icy 
darkness. There was no moon, and no  

744
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:07,520
lights were visible anywhere. But Catherine 
was sure she could see Wuthering Heights.

745
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:16,880
'Look!' she said. 'There's my old 
home, and the churchyard near it.  

746
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:28,160
I won't lie there alone, Heathcliff! I won't 
rest until you're in the grave with me!'

747
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:35,280
I was still holding her back from the window, and 
wondering what to do next, when Mr Edgar entered.

748
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:41,840
'Please help, sir,' I called, 'Mrs Linton is ill.'

749
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:48,960
'Catherine's ill?' he gasped. 'Shut 
the window, Ellen! Catherine! Why-'

750
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:58,720
When he saw his wife's face, he was so shocked 
that he stopped speaking and stared at her in  

751
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,400
horror. She was almost unconscious 
and did not recognize him at first.

752
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,760
'Ah,  

753
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:19,600
it's you, is it, Edgar Linton?' she said after a 
few moments. 'You don't come when you're wanted,  

754
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:29,200
and now you come when you're not wanted! 
But whatever you say, nothing can keep me  

755
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:38,400
from my home, my place of rest, out there in 
the open air, with a gravestone at my head!'

756
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,680
'She's feverish, sir, and 
doesn't know what she's saying,'  

757
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:49,040
I whispered. 'If she has food 
and rest, she'll recover.'

758
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,000
'I want no further advice from you, Ellen Dean,'  

759
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:00,560
said Mr Edgar coldly. You knew how 
ill she was, and you didn't tell me!'

760
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,560
I ran downstairs and out of the 
kitchen door to fetch the doctor.  

761
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,040
I thought I heard the sound 
of horses in the distance,  

762
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:17,920
which seemed strange at two o'clock in the 
morning. And when I found Dr Kenneth, he told me  

763
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,400
someone had seen Isabella and Heathcliff meeting 
secretly in the garden earlier that evening.

764
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:32,880
That night none of us slept. We all sat together 
and waited, while the doctor stayed with his  

765
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:39,600
patient. He told us he hoped that Catherine 
would recover, if we kept her very quiet.

766
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:50,400
In the morning we discovered that Isabella's room 
was empty. She had run away with Heathcliff! When  

767
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:59,760
Mr Edgar heard the news, he just said, 'She chose 
to go with him. Don't speak to me of her again.  

768
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:05,120
I no longer think of her as my sister.'
 
 

769
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,320
CHAPTER NINE

770
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:12,800
Isabella's story

771
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:22,400
1784 For two months we heard 
nothing of Isabella or Heathcliff.  

772
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:31,360
During that time Catherine was dangerously 
ill with brain fever, and Dr Kenneth warned us  

773
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:38,720
that even if she recovered, her brain would 
never return to normal. However she did seem  

774
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:45,200
to get better, and no one could have been happier 
than my master, when he saw her sitting up in bed  

775
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:51,040
for the first time, and beginning to take an 
interest in the people and things around her.  

776
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:58,880
He loved her so much, and took such good care 
of her, that I really thought she would recover.  

777
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,360
There was another reason for her 
to live. She was expecting a baby,  

778
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,840
and we all hoped she would have a son, 
who would inherit the Linton fortune.

779
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:20,320
Then Mr Edgar received a letter from Isabella, 
telling him that she and Heathcliff were married.  

780
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,840
With it was a long letter for me, which said:

781
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,320
Wuthering Heights

782
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,400
Dear Ellen,

783
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I arrived here last night and 
heard that Catherine is ill.  

784
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:42,160
My brother refuses to write to me, so 
you are the only one I can write to.  

785
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:51,840
Tell Edgar I still love him and Catherine, and 
want to return to Thrushcross Grange, but I can't!

786
01:32:53,440 --> 01:33:01,200
The rest of this letter is for you alone, Ellen. 
Two questions - how did you manage to get on  

787
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:10,080
with the people in this house? They don't seem 
human! And (this interests me very much) what is  

788
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:20,560
Mr Heathcliff? A man? A madman? A devil? When 
you come to visit me, you must explain to me  

789
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:26,720
what sort of creature I've married. And you 
must come very soon, with a message from Edgar.

790
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:34,160
Heathcliff brought me here last night. 
This house is going to be my home, he says.  

791
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:44,000
He disappeared as soon as we arrived, so I entered 
the kitchen alone. What a miserable, depressing  

792
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:52,880
place it is now, Ellen! By the fire stood a dirty 
child. I realized he must be Catherine's nephew,  

793
01:33:52,880 --> 01:34:00,960
Hareton, and tried to shake his hand. But he 
greeted me by swearing at me, so I went into  

794
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:09,200
the hall to find somebody else. When I knocked at 
another door, it was opened by a tall, thin man,  

795
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:16,960
with long, dirty hair hanging down to his 
shoulders. I knew this must be Hindley Earnshaw,  

796
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:23,760
Catherine's brother and Hareton's father. His 
eyes, and Hareton's, reminded me of Catherine.

797
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,720
'What do you want?' he asked roughly.

798
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:35,680
'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied. 
'Now I'm married to Mr Heathcliff.'

799
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:42,400
'Ah, so that devil has 
returned! Good!' he growled.

800
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:50,880
You can imagine, Ellen, how unhappy I felt in 
that unpleasant house. I knew that only four  

801
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:58,480
miles away was my real home, Thrushcross Grange, 
containing the only people I loved in the world.  

802
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,320
But those four miles were like an 
ocean, which I could not cross!  

803
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:11,360
Don't tell Edgar or Catherine this, but I had 
hoped to find a friend at Wuthering Heights,  

804
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,400
someone to support me against Heathcliff. Now 
I realized that no one here would help me.

805
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:28,720
After a long silence I said, 'Please ask a maid to 
show me my bedroom. I'm tired after my journey.'

806
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:36,320
'We have no maids here,' he answered. 'Joseph 
will show you Heathcliffs room, if you like.  

807
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:43,040
And - and - you'd better lock 
the bedroom door tonight!'

808
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:49,600
Why, Mr Earnshaw?' I asked. I did not 
want to lock myself in with Heathcliff.

809
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,560
He brought out a gun, which 
had a knife attached to it.

810
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:02,560
'Look at this,' he said. Every night 
I try to open his bedroom door.  

811
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:09,840
Up to now he's locked it. But one night 
he'll forget, and then I'll kill him!'

812
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,320
'Why do you hate him so much?' I asked.

813
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:21,440
'Because he's taken everything from me!' 
he shouted angrily. 'There's nothing  

814
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:28,320
left for Hareton to inherit! But I'm going 
to get it all back and his money too,  

815
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:32,720
and then his blood. Then the 
devil can have his soul!'

816
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,720
He seemed mad to me, Ellen. I left him, 
and went to find the old servant, Joseph.  

817
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:46,640
It seemed that Heathcliffs room was 
locked, and there were no guest bedrooms,  

818
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:53,120
so in the end I slept on a chair in the 
child's room. What a welcome to my new home!

819
01:36:54,480 --> 01:37:01,440
I know Heathcliff blames Edgar for Catherine's 
illness. He has warned me he'll make me suffer  

820
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:10,320
for it. Oh, I do hate him - I'm so miserable 
- I've been such a fool! Don't tell anyone at  

821
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:15,840
Thrushcross Grange about this, Ellen. 
Come quickly - don't disappoint me!

822
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:19,840
Isabella

823
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:27,440
As soon as I had read this, I asked Mr Edgar if 
I could take a message from him to his sister.

824
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:35,760
'You may visit her this afternoon, Ellen, if 
you like. Tell her I'm not angry, just sorry  

825
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:43,280
to have lost her. I can't imagine she will ever be 
happy. I shall never visit her or write to her.'

826
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,360
When I arrived at Wuthering Heights that 
afternoon, I was shocked to see how much worse  

827
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:58,640
the house looked than when I used to live there. I 
realized that Hindley did not care what conditions  

828
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:06,880
he lived in, and Joseph clearly spent more time 
praying than cleaning. Heathcliff and Isabella  

829
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:13,360
were both in the main room. Heathcliff looked 
more like a gentleman than I had ever seen him,  

830
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:21,360
but his wife had not bothered to brush her hair 
or change her dress. I had to explain to poor  

831
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:28,400
Isabella that Mr Edgar had refused to write to 
her. She cried a little when she heard that.  

832
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:35,040
Then Heathcliff asked me question after 
question about Catherine's illness.

833
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:44,560
'If you really love her,' I told him, 'you'll keep 
away from her now. She mustn't be over-excited.  

834
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:51,600
Her health will always be weak. And her 
loving husband is a very good nurse to her!'

835
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:58,080
'Her loving husband!' repeated 
Heathcliff scornfully.  

836
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:06,560
'Don't compare my feeling for her with his! 
No, Ellen, before you leave this house,  

837
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:13,440
I'll make you promise to arrange a meeting 
for me with Catherine. I must see her!'

838
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:23,040
'I'll never agree to that,' I said. 'She's just 
beginning to recover. She's almost forgotten you,  

839
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,840
and now you want to upset her again!'

840
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:34,800
'Ellen, you know as well as I do that she 
can never forget me! If she thinks once  

841
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,720
of Edgar Linton, she thinks a thousand 
times of me! He can't love her as I can!  

842
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,800
And Catherine has a heart as deep as mine!'

843
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,560
'Catherine and Edgar are very fond of each other!'  

844
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:55,760
said Isabella suddenly. 'Don't 
speak of my brother like that!'

845
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,800
'Your dear brother doesn't care enough about  

846
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:05,760
you to write to you,' replied 
Heathcliff, smiling sourly.

847
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:12,640
'That's because he doesn't know how much 
I've suffered,' she answered quietly,  

848
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,760
turning away to hide the tears on her face.

849
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:24,240
'Sir,' I said, 'it seems to me that Miss 
Isabella, Mrs Heathcliff, I should say,  

850
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:33,600
is unhappy. You must treat her kindly. Try to 
look after her. Let her have a maid, for example.'

851
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,560
'I'm not going to be soft with 
her,' he replied with a laugh.  

852
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:43,680
'She was stupid enough to run away 
with me. I never pretended to love her.  

853
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:50,400
Now I think she's beginning to realize that 
I scorn her. She's an even weaker fool than  

854
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:56,400
her brother, but she's going to be useful 
to me. That's why I'm keeping her with me.'

855
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:03,840
'Ellen, he says he married me 
to have his revenge on Edgar!  

856
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:11,040
But I won't let him carry out his plan, whatever 
it is. I'll die, or I'll see him dead first!'

857
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:18,720
'You're getting violent, Isabella!' 
said Heathcliff. Go upstairs now.  

858
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:26,960
I want to speak to Ellen Dean in private. Go 
on!' And he pushed her roughly out of the door.

859
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:32,240
'Don't you feel pity for her?' I asked,  

860
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:37,920
when we were alone. 'Have you ever 
felt pity for anybody in your life?'

861
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:46,960
'Why should I? She's just like an insect under 
my foot. The more she cries, the more I enjoy  

862
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:55,680
hurting her. Now, Ellen, listen. I'll wait every 
day and every evening in the Grange garden,  

863
01:41:55,680 --> 01:42:02,960
until I find a chance to see Catherine. If I meet 
Edgar Linton or his servants, I'll shoot them.  

864
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,880
But don't you think it'd 
be better to avoid a fight?  

865
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,840
You could tell me when she'll be 
alone. Then there'll be no violence.'

866
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:22,960
I argued and complained, and refused fifty 
times, but in the end he forced me to agree.  

867
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:31,200
I promised to let him know when Edgar Linton was 
away from home. I suppose it was wrong of me,  

868
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,480
but I hoped it would be Heathcliffs 
last meeting with Catherine.
 
 

869
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,840
CHAPTER TEN

870
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,600
Heathcliff visits Catherine for the last time

871
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:54,080
1784 Heathcliff had given 
me a letter for Catherine,  

872
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:59,760
but I decided not to show it to her 
until Mr Edgar was out of the house.  

873
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:08,160
My chance came four days after my visit 
to Wuthering Heights. As it was a Sunday,  

874
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:14,080
Mr Edgar and all the servants went to church, 
leaving me alone to look after Catherine.

875
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:23,200
She was sitting downstairs, by an open window, 
enjoying the spring sunshine. Her appearance  

876
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:29,120
had changed since her illness, but there 
was a strange beauty in her pale face.  

877
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:38,000
She did not read or sew any more, but used to 
sit there silently, staring into the distance.  

878
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,160
Her eyes seemed fixed on something far 
away, something beyond normal sight.

879
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,680
I showed her the letter, but she looked confused  

880
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:53,920
and could not seem to understand 
it, so I had to explain.

881
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:03,360
'It's from Mr Heathcliff,' I said gently. 
'He's in the garden, and wants to see you.  

882
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:05,840
What shall I tell him?'

883
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,840
She said nothing, but bent 
forward in her chair to listen.  

884
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:19,920
We both heard someone coming through the hall. 
Heathcliff had realized the house was almost  

885
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:27,600
empty, and had found an open door. Catherine 
looked eagerly towards the entrance to the room.  

886
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:38,800
He appeared, and in two steps was by her side. 
For five whole minutes he held her in his arms  

887
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:45,200
and kissed her again and again. It gave 
him great pain to look at her face.  

888
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:53,280
He could see, as I could, that she would 
never recover, that she was certain to die.

889
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:04,000
'Oh, Catherine! Oh, my life! 
How can I bear it!' he cried.

890
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:16,560
'You and Edgar have broken my heart,' said 
Catherine. 'And you both want me to pity you!  

891
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,120
How strong you are, Heathcliff! 
You'll live for years after my death!  

892
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,440
Will you forget me, and be happy 
with others, when I'm in my grave?'

893
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:41,440
'It's wicked of you to say that, Catherine. You 
know your words will burn forever in my memory  

894
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:45,600
after you've left me. You know 
I could never forget you!'

895
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,280
'I don't want you to suffer 
more than I do, Heathcliff.  

896
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:57,840
I only want us to be together, always.'

897
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,880
Heathcliff turned away, his shoulders shaking.

898
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:13,440
'That isn't my Heathcliff,' Catherine said 
to me. 'I'll always love my Heathcliff,  

899
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:24,000
and take him with me. He's in my soul, you see. 
Oh, Ellen, I do want to escape from this prison.  

900
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:33,120
There's a beautiful world waiting for me out 
there. You feel sorry for me now because I'm ill.  

901
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:41,760
Well, very soon I'll feel sorry for 
you, because I'll be beyond you all!'

902
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:52,480
Heathcliff turned towards her, his fierce eyes 
wet. For a moment they looked at each other,  

903
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:57,840
and then they were in each other's arms 
again. No one could have separated them.

904
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:05,680
'How cruel you've been to me, 
Catherine!' he cried wildly.  

905
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:16,880
'You loved me, so why did you marry Edgar Linton? 
It's all your fault! I haven't broken your heart,  

906
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:25,440
you've broken it! And you've broken mine too! 
Do you think I want to live after you are dead?'

907
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:34,000
'If I've done wrong, I'm dying 
for it!' sobbed Catherine.  

908
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:45,600
It's your fault too, Heathcliff! You left me, 
remember? But I forgive you. Now forgive me!'

909
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:55,440
'It's hard to forgive, when I look at 
your sad eyes, and feel your thin hands.  

910
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:04,800
Kiss me again, Catherine! I forgive you for making 
me suffer, but how can I forgive you for dying?'

911
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,240
Catherine sobbed quietly, 
hiding her face in his shoulder,  

912
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:16,160
and tears rolled down Heathcliffs dark face.

913
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,880
Suddenly I noticed, through the window, 
the servants coming back from church.  

914
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,760
I was afraid Mr Edgar would 
find Heathcliff with Catherine.

915
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,320
'My master will be here in 
a moment,' I warned them.

916
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,160
'I must go, Catherine,' said Heathcliff.

917
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:46,240
'No, no!' she screamed. 'Don't go! It's the 
last time! Edgar won't hurt us! Heathcliff,  

918
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,480
I'll die if you go!'

919
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:57,280
'All right, my darling, I'll stay. If 
he shot me in your arms, I'd die happy.'

920
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:05,920
At that moment my master appeared 
at the door. When he saw Heathcliff  

921
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,280
holding his wife, he went pale with anger.

922
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:17,280
'Here, take care of her first,' said Heathcliff, 
putting Catherine in her husband's arms,  

923
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:23,200
'then speak to me later if you 
wish.' He walked out of the house.

924
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,960
Catherine seemed to be unconscious, and Mr Edgar  

925
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,960
was so worried about her that he 
forgot about Heathcliff for the moment.  

926
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:40,320
She recovered a little, but did not recognize 
any of us, and was clearly very ill.  

927
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:49,440
We put her to bed immediately, and at twelve 
o'clock that night her daughter, Cathy, was born,  

928
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:56,800
two months early. That's the young lady 
you saw at Wuthering Heights, Mr Lockwood.  

929
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:06,080
Two hours later, Catherine died, without 
calling for Heathcliff, or recognizing Edgar.  

930
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,800
My poor master was in the depths of despair.  

931
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,960
I thought it was very unfortunate that 
Catherine had only given him a daughter,  

932
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:24,960
not a son. Now the Linton fortune would pass to 
Isabella and her husband after Mr Edgar's death.

933
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,640
'Catherine's dead body lay peacefully on her bed.  

934
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:40,240
In death she looked more beautiful than in 
life. I wondered if she was now beyond us all',  

935
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:45,520
as she had said, and hoped that 
her soul had found a home with God.

936
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,480
In the morning I went to look for Heathcliff.  

937
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:57,040
I found him in the Grange garden, where 
he had been waiting for news all night.

938
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:07,920
'She's dead, I know!' he called to me as I came 
closer. 'Don't cry, she doesn't need your tears!  

939
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:20,000
Tell me - tell me, how did-?' He tried 
to say her name, but could not manage it.  

940
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:25,760
How did she die?' he said at last,  

941
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:33,840
staring fiercely at me. Don't be 
sorry for me, I don't want your pity!'

942
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:45,040
'Poor creature!' I thought. You have a heart just 
like other men, but you are too proud to show it!'

943
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:55,040
Aloud I said, 'She died quietly, in her 
sleep. Her life finished in a gentle dream.  

944
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:59,200
I hope she wakes as calmly in the other world!'

945
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:11,520
'Where are you, Catherine?' he cried in despair. 
'Don't leave me here, where I can't find you!  

946
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:20,960
I pray that you will never rest while I'm 
alive. You said I killed you - haunt me then!  

947
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:29,920
Murdered people do haunt their murderers, 
I believe. Come back as a ghost - drive me  

948
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:37,920
mad - I don't care! Oh, God! I can't bear 
it! I cannot live without you, my soul!'

949
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:47,840
He howled like a wild animal, and hit his 
forehead several times against a tree,  

950
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:55,200
until the wood was covered in blood. I knew 
I could no longer help him, so I left him.

951
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:05,120
Catherine was buried the following Friday. Her 
brother Hindley, although invited, did not come,  

952
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:13,200
and Isabella was not invited, so it was only Mr 
Edgar and the servants who attended the ceremony.  

953
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,880
To our surprise, she was not buried 
in the church with the Lintons,  

954
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:26,000
nor with the Earnshaws. She lies in 
an open corner of the churchyard,  

955
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,480
where she can breathe the air from the 
moors. Her husband's grave is next to hers.
 
 

956
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:37,840
CHAPTER ELEVEN

957
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:40,560
Isabella escapes

958
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:51,840
1784 That Friday evening the wind changed, 
and brought first rain, then snow.  

959
01:53:53,120 --> 01:54:00,960
Next morning the spring flowers were all hidden 
under deep snow. Mr Edgar stayed in his room.  

960
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:08,960
I was in the sitting-room with the baby, when I 
was surprised to hear a girl's voice behind me.  

961
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:18,320
I turned round, and saw it was Isabella 
Heathcliff. I was quite shocked by her appearance.  

962
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:26,720
Her hair was loose, and wet with snow and rain. 
She wore a light silk dress and thin shoes,  

963
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,280
which did not seem at all suitable 
for a long walk in the snow.  

964
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:41,360
Under her ear was a deep wound, which was 
bleeding. Her face was scratched and bruised,  

965
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:47,200
and she looked very tired. I could 
see that she was expecting a baby.

966
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:55,200
'I've run all the way here from Wuthering 
Heights,' she said, gasping for breath.  

967
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:02,800
'I couldn't count how many times I've fallen 
down! Ellen, please ask a maid to find some  

968
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,920
dry clothes for me, and then I'll go on 
to the village. I'm not staying here.'

969
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,800
'First, my dear young lady,' I told her,  

970
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:18,800
'you'll get warm and dry, and I'll put a bandage 
on that wound. Then we'll have some tea.'

971
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:25,120
She was so exhausted that she let 
me help her without protesting,  

972
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:32,160
and finally we sat down together 
near the fire with our cups of tea.

973
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:39,280
'Oh, Ellen,' she said, 'I cried bitterly 
when I heard of Catherine's death, you know.  

974
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:45,920
And Heathcliff is desperately sad! 
But I can't feel sorry for him.  

975
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:54,240
This is the last thing of his I've got,' and 
she took off her gold wedding-ring and threw  

976
01:55:54,240 --> 01:56:01,520
it in the fire. I'll never go back to him. But 
I can't stay here, in case he comes to find me.  

977
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:10,880
And anyway I don't want to beg for Edgar's help, 
or make trouble for him. To escape from Heathcliff  

978
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:16,400
I must go a long way away. How could 
Catherine have liked him, Ellen?  

979
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:20,560
I wish he would die, and then 
I could forget him completely!'

980
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:27,840
'Don't say that,' I protested, he's a human 
being. There are worse men than him in the world!'

981
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:36,480
'He isn't human,' she replied. 'I gave 
him my heart, and he destroyed it,  

982
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:41,840
so I can't feel pity for him. But I 
must tell you how I managed to escape.  

983
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:50,160
Hindley Earnshaw should have been at Catherine's 
burial yesterday, but he had been drinking so  

984
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:58,640
much that he couldn't go. Last night he and I were 
sitting silently in the kitchen at about midnight,  

985
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:05,920
when Heathcliff came home. Hindley decided to lock 
the doors so that Heathcliff could not get in.  

986
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:14,480
He told me his plan was to murder his hated guest 
that night, with the weapon he had shown me.  

987
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:22,560
I hate Heathcliff too, but I could not 
agree to murder, so I called out a warning  

988
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:28,880
from the kitchen window. Heathcliff swore 
horribly at me and broke one of the windows.  

989
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:35,920
Hindley put his right arm out through the hole, 
with the gun in it, and aimed it at his enemy.  

990
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:42,080
But before he could fire, Heathcliff 
caught hold of the gun and pulled it  

991
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:47,840
away from Hindley. The knife cut into 
Hindley's wrist, and blood poured out.  

992
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,840
Heathcliff jumped into the 
kitchen through the window,  

993
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:58,640
and started kicking and hitting Hindley, who 
was lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.

994
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:06,080
I ran off to find Joseph. When we 
came back, Heathcliff was putting  

995
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:12,080
a bandage on Hindley's wrist. Joseph 
was shocked at the sight of his master,  

996
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:18,000
and would have gone to the police, if Heathcliff 
hadn't forced me to describe what happened.  

997
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:23,840
I had to agree that Hindley had 
certainly attacked Heathcliff first.

998
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:33,360
The next day, I decided to have my revenge on 
Heathcliff, by telling Hindley that 'that devil'  

999
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:40,720
had hit and kicked him when he was unconscious. 
And I told Heathcliff to his face that he could  

1000
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:47,920
never have made Catherine happy, if she had been 
his wife. This made him so angry that he threw  

1001
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:55,760
a knife at me, which cut my neck, and then he 
rushed towards me, swearing violently. I knew  

1002
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:03,360
I had to get away quickly, and as I ran out of the 
kitchen, I saw Hindley attack Heathcliff. Both of  

1003
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:09,920
them were rolling on the floor, fighting. I came 
over the moors through the snow to the Grange.  

1004
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:17,680
At last I'm free! And I shall never, never 
spend another night at Wuthering Heights.'

1005
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:26,880
After drinking her tea, Isabella 
left the Grange. From our village  

1006
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:31,600
she travelled by coach to the 
south, where she made her new home  

1007
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:39,760
near London. There, a few months later, 
she had a son. She called him Linton.

1008
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,040
Heathcliff must have discovered 
this from the servants.  

1009
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:49,200
One day when I saw him in the village, he said,  

1010
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:58,640
'I hear I've got a son, Ellen, whose name's 
Linton! I suppose Isabella wants me to hate him!  

1011
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:07,360
She can keep him for the moment. But tell Edgar 
Linton I'll have the boy one day! He's mine!'

1012
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:18,160
After Catherine's death my poor master, Mr Edgar, 
was a changed man. He no longer went to church,  

1013
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:26,080
or saw any friends. He occasionally went for 
lonely walks on the moors, and regularly visited  

1014
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:34,960
his wife's grave. But fortunately Catherine had 
left him something of herself, her daughter Cathy.  

1015
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,840
This tiny child soon won his heart.

1016
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:46,880
It's strange, Mr Lockwood, to compare Hindley 
and Edgar. They both lost their wives, and were  

1017
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:53,680
left with a child. Hindley did not believe in 
God, and showed no interest in his son Hareton.  

1018
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,680
But Edgar believed, and loved 
his daughter Cathy deeply.

1019
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,760
Hindley himself died six months 
after his sister Catherine.  

1020
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:13,120
We never discovered exactly what happened, but 
Heathcliff said he had drunk himself to death.  

1021
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:21,040
It appeared that Heathcliff had won Hindley's 
house, land and money from him when playing cards,  

1022
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:28,560
so he was now the master of Wuthering Heights. 
Hareton inherited nothing from his father,  

1023
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:32,400
and could only stay on at 
Wuthering Heights as a servant,  

1024
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:36,480
working for the man who had 
been his father's enemy.
 
 

1025
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:41,600
CHAPTER TWELVE

1026
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,680
Bringing up Cathy

1027
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:53,520
1797 During the next twelve years I was 
happier than I had ever been before.  

1028
02:01:54,640 --> 02:02:00,560
All my time was spent looking after little 
Cathy, who brought sunshine into our lives.  

1029
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:07,520
She was a real beauty, with the Earnshaws' 
dark eyes and the Lintons' fair skin.  

1030
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:13,920
She wasn't as proud and quick-tempered as her 
mother, but she was used to getting what she  

1031
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:20,560
wanted. Her father loved her so much that he 
gave her everything, and never scolded her.

1032
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:27,440
Until she was thirteen she had 
never been outside the Grange garden  

1033
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:35,200
alone. She knew nothing of Wuthering 
Heights or Heathcliff. She often asked me  

1034
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:42,160
about the hills in the distance, beyond the 
moors, and wanted to ride her pony there. I  

1035
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:48,240
knew the master would not let her leave 
the safety of the Grange to go so far,  

1036
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:56,640
especially as the road to the hills passed 
close to Wuthering Heights. So I always told  

1037
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:03,600
her she would be able to go there when she was 
older. I did not know what she was planning.

1038
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,360
Mr Edgar received a letter 
from his sister Isabella.  

1039
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:17,360
She wrote that she was dying of a fever, and asked 
him to visit her for the first and last time.  

1040
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:24,960
She also wanted him to take care 
of her son Linton after her death.

1041
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:34,720
Although my master hated travelling, he did 
not hesitate to do as she requested. He told me  

1042
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:38,000
to look after Cathy carefully, and left at once.

1043
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:46,240
He was away for three weeks. Cathy 
did not cause me any trouble at first.  

1044
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:52,800
She spent her days walking her dogs and 
riding her pony in the large garden.  

1045
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:58,640
But one day she asked if she 
could stay out the whole day,  

1046
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:05,280
and away she went on her little pony, 
with her two dogs running behind.

1047
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:12,720
There was no sign of her at tea-time, 
and I began to be seriously worried.  

1048
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:22,560
I went outside to look for her. At the gate I 
found a workman, who had seen her jump the low  

1049
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:29,920
wall separating the garden from the road, and then 
ride on towards the hills and Wuthering Heights.

1050
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,680
I was very frightened now. She 
could be lost on the moors!  

1051
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,280
She could have tried to 
climb the hills, and fallen!  

1052
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:46,560
I walked across the moors as fast as I could, 
and arrived breathless at Wuthering Heights.  

1053
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:55,440
How glad I was to see one of her dogs lying 
outside the kitchen door! I knocked loudly,  

1054
02:04:56,080 --> 02:05:02,160
and Zillah let me in. I knew she had been 
the housekeeper there since Hindley's death.

1055
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:12,080
'Ah,' she said, 'you've come for your little 
mistress! She's here, quite safe! The master,  

1056
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:15,840
Mr Heathcliff, isn't here. He 
won't be back for a while.'

1057
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:24,960
Cathy was sitting comfortably in the kitchen, 
talking eagerly to Hareton. He was now  

1058
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:31,680
a big, strong young man of eighteen, 
who was staring rather stupidly at her.  

1059
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:38,720
I was delighted to find her again, but 
I pretended to be angry to punish her.

1060
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:46,160
'Well, miss! You are wicked, 
going such a long way all alone!  

1061
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:52,720
I've been all over the moors looking 
for you! Your father will be angry!'

1062
02:05:54,240 --> 02:06:00,560
'What have I done?' she sobbed, 
suddenly frightened. 'Father  

1063
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:07,520
didn't forbid me to leave the Grange garden! He 
won't scold me, Ellen. He's never cross, like you!  

1064
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:15,840
And I've been to the hills, Ellen! This - man 
- showed me, because I didn't know the way.'

1065
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:20,960
I made her put on her hat and prepare to leave.

1066
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,600
'Whose house is this?' she asked suddenly.  

1067
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:31,680
'It's your father's, isn't it?' 
she added, turning to Hareton.

1068
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:38,400
'No,' he replied, looking 
down. His face went very red.

1069
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:42,720
'Whose then - your master's?' she asked.

1070
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,120
He swore, and turned away.

1071
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:52,960
'Ellen, he didn't say "miss" to me. Servants 
should always say "miss", shouldn't they?'

1072
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:58,480
Hareton frowned and looked 
very angry, but said nothing.

1073
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,640
'You, get my horse,' she ordered him. 'Hurry!'

1074
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:12,480
'What the devil do you mean? I'm 
not your servant!' he growled.

1075
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,320
'You see, Miss Cathy? Nice words 
to be used to a young lady!  

1076
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:23,600
Now come along, let's fetch 
the pony and leave,' I said.

1077
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:29,200
'But Ellen,' she cried, staring horrified at him,  

1078
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:35,360
'how dare he speak to me like 
that! He must do as I tell him!'

1079
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:40,320
'He's not your servant, miss,' said Zillah,  

1080
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:44,160
who had been listening to the 
conversation. 'He's your cousin.'

1081
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:54,000
'He can't be my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a 
scornful laugh. 'Father has gone to fetch my  

1082
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:01,760
cousin from London. He's a gentleman's 
son, not - not a farm worker like him!'  

1083
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,840
She pointed at poor Hareton, 
whose clothes were old and dirty.

1084
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:16,160
I was very annoyed with her and Zillah. Now 
Heathcliff would hear about his son's arrival,  

1085
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:23,040
which we had hoped to keep secret from him. And 
Cathy would certainly ask her father whether she  

1086
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:32,000
had a cousin at Wuthering Heights. On our way home 
I explained to her that if her father discovered  

1087
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,320
she had visited Wuthering Heights, he would 
perhaps be so angry with me that he would send  

1088
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:47,600
me away. She could not bear to think of that, so 
she promised to keep her visit a secret from him.

1089
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:53,680
We heard from Mr Edgar that his sister had died,  

1090
02:08:53,680 --> 02:09:00,560
and that he was returning soon with his 
young nephew. Cathy was wild with excitement.  

1091
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:07,760
She would see her dear father again, and 
have a cousin of the same age to play with.

1092
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:18,720
But when the coach arrived, young Linton had to be 
carried into the house. He was a pale, thin boy,  

1093
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:27,600
who looked very like Mr Edgar. He seemed so weak 
that I wondered how long he would live. I thought  

1094
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:33,680
he would have no chance of life if his father 
Heathcliff took him to live at Wuthering Heights.

1095
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:43,040
In fact Linton only stayed one night with 
us. Later that evening Heathcliffs servant  

1096
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:48,800
Joseph arrived and asked to speak 
to the master. Although it was late  

1097
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:56,560
and Mr Edgar was tired after his journey, Joseph 
insisted, so I took him to the master's room.

1098
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:04,240
'Heathcliff has sent me for his son, and 
I can't go back without him,' he said.

1099
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:13,280
Mr Edgar was silent for a moment. On his 
face was an expression of deep sadness. He  

1100
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:20,720
had hoped to keep Linton with him, as Isabella had 
wished. But he could not refuse the boy's father.

1101
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:29,520
'Tell Mr Heathcliff,' he said calmly, that 
Ellen will take his son to Wuthering Heights  

1102
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,920
tomorrow. He's asleep at the 
moment, and I won't disturb him.'

1103
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:42,400
'No!' said Joseph, banging the table with 
his hand. 'I must take him back now!'

1104
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:52,160
'Not tonight!' answered Mr Edgar. 'Leave the 
house now, and tell your master what I said!'

1105
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:56,800
'Very well!' shouted Joseph, as he walked out.  

1106
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:02,240
'If he doesn't arrive early in the 
morning, Heathcliff will come for him!'
 
 

1107
02:11:06,640 --> 02:11:07,680
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1108
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:11,280
Heathcliffs son at Wuthering Heights

1109
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:20,800
1797 Linton was very surprised to be 
woken so early, and told that he had  

1110
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:28,240
another journey to make, before breakfast. As 
we rode the four miles to Wuthering Heights,  

1111
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:34,640
he kept asking me questions about his new 
home, and the father he had never seen.  

1112
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:44,000
When we arrived, Heathcliff, Hareton, and Joseph 
all came out of the house to inspect the child.

1113
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:53,920
'Master, that's not a boy,' said Joseph after a 
while. 'Look at that white skin and fair hair!  

1114
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,440
Mr Edgar's sent you his daughter instead!'

1115
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:02,640
'God! What a beautiful creature!'  

1116
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:07,280
laughed Heathcliff scornfully. 
'That's worse than I expected!'

1117
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:13,120
I helped the trembling child off the horse  

1118
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:18,000
and into the house. Heathcliff 
took him roughly by the arm.

1119
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:23,360
'I hope you'll be kind to him, Mr Heathcliff,'  

1120
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:28,960
I said. He's weak, and ill. And 
he's all the family you've got!'

1121
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:39,360
'Don't worry, Ellen,' replied Heathcliff with a 
smile. As Isabella's son he'll inherit Thrushcross  

1122
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:46,800
Grange one day, and I don't want him to die 
before that. He'll be educated as a gentleman.  

1123
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:53,680
But I'm bitterly disappointed at having 
such a weak, crying baby for a son!'

1124
02:12:55,600 --> 02:13:03,040
So poor Linton was left in his father's 
care. At first Cathy was miserable,  

1125
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:08,480
because she would not now have anyone 
to play with, but she soon forgot him.  

1126
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:16,000
Whenever I met Zillah, the housekeeper, in 
the village, I used to ask her about Linton.

1127
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:23,280
'He's often ill,' she told me. 'And so 
selfish! He has to have a fire even in summer!  

1128
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,600
He calls for cakes and hot drinks all the time.  

1129
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:34,720
He only ever thinks of himself. Mr Heathcliff 
can't bear being in the same room as him!'

1130
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:46,240
Several years passed without any more news of 
Linton. In 1800 Cathy reached the age of sixteen.  

1131
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:51,760
We never celebrated her birthday, 
because it was also the day her  

1132
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:58,400
mother died. On this particular day she 
came downstairs, dressed for going out,  

1133
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:04,720
and suggested a walk on the moors 
with me. Her father gave permission.

1134
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:11,760
It was a lovely spring morning, and I 
was very happy walking in the sunshine,  

1135
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:18,320
watching Cathy running ahead of me. But 
we had walked further than I had realized,  

1136
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:23,520
and I called to her to come back. 
She did not seem to hear me.  

1137
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:32,160
We were on the moors, close to Wuthering Heights, 
when I caught sight of two men talking to her.  

1138
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:40,080
I recognized Heathcliff and Hareton at 
once. I hurried to catch up with her.

1139
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:49,040
'Miss Cathy,' I said breathlessly, 'we must 
go home. Your father will be getting worried.'

1140
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:56,720
'No, he won't, Ellen. This gentleman wants 
me to go to his house and meet his son.  

1141
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:03,840
He says we've already met, but I don't 
remember, do you? Let's go, Ellen!'

1142
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:11,280
Although I protested, she and Hareton 
were already halfway to Wuthering Heights.  

1143
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,640
Heathcliff and I followed behind.

1144
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:19,440
'It's very bad of you, Mr Heathcliff,'  

1145
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:24,720
I scolded him. 'Mr Edgar will blame 
me for letting her go to your house.'

1146
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:32,400
'I want her to see Linton, Ellen,' 
he replied. 'Listen to my plan.  

1147
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:40,640
It's really a very generous one. I 
want the two cousins to fall in love  

1148
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:48,640
and marry. You know Cathy won't inherit 
anything from her father. My son Linton  

1149
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:55,520
will inherit all the Linton fortune when Edgar 
dies. If she marries Linton, she'll be wealthy.  

1150
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:03,840
Of course, if Linton dies, then the money 
comes to me, as his only other relation.'

1151
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:11,760
I was still angry with Heathcliff, but it was too 
late to stop Cathy entering Wuthering Heights.  

1152
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:19,600
She was delighted to rediscover her cousin 
Linton, who was keeping warm by the fire.

1153
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:28,720
'If he is my cousin, and you are his father,' 
she said to Heathcliff, smiling, then  

1154
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:33,200
you must be my uncle! Why don't 
you ever visit us at the Grange?'

1155
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:40,640
'I visited it once or twice too 
often before you were born,' he said.  

1156
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:45,840
'I must tell you that I quarrelled 
violently with your father once.  

1157
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:52,320
He hates me, and if you tell him you 
want to come here, he'll forbid it.'

1158
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:01,359
'Well, if I can't come here, Linton can come to 
visit me at the Grange,' suggested Cathy happily.

1159
02:17:03,439 --> 02:17:10,399
'It'll be too far for me,' said her cousin 
weakly. 'It would kill me to walk four miles.'

1160
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,880
Heathcliff looked scornfully at his son.

1161
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:24,241
'I don't think my plan will ever succeed, Ellen!' 
he whispered to me. 'Who would fall in love with a  

1162
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:32,319
selfish baby like that?' He went to the kitchen 
door and called, Hareton! Come and take Miss  

1163
02:17:32,319 --> 02:17:39,120
Cathy round the farm.' Cathy was eager to see 
the animals, and she and Hareton went out.

1164
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:46,240
As we watched them through the kitchen window, 
Heathcliff seemed to be thinking aloud.

1165
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:55,840
'I've taken my revenge on his father, by 
making Hareton work for me. I treat him badly,  

1166
02:17:56,399 --> 02:18:05,200
as they used to do to me, and he suffers, 
as I used to. He's intelligent, and strong,  

1167
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:14,559
and handsome, but I've taught him to scorn those 
qualities. So now he's just an uneducated farm  

1168
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:26,000
worker, and knows nothing of the world. That's 
how he'll always be. And my son? He's stupid,  

1169
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:34,000
and weak, and ill. But he's a gentleman, 
and he'll marry Cathy, and he'll be rich!'

1170
02:18:36,399 --> 02:18:42,479
Meanwhile Linton had got up from his armchair 
and gone out to join Cathy and Hareton.  

1171
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:47,520
Through the open window I 
could hear the two younger ones  

1172
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:54,800
laughing at Hareton's coarse way of speaking. 
I began to dislike Linton rather than pity him.

1173
02:18:56,160 --> 02:19:01,200
When we arrived back at the Grange, 
Cathy told her father about the visit.  

1174
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:08,880
He did not want to frighten her, and, in my 
opinion, did not explain clearly enough why  

1175
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:16,240
she should never communicate with Linton again. At 
the time she seemed to accept her father's wish.

1176
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:24,400
During the next few weeks, however, 
I noticed Cathy's behaviour change.  

1177
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:32,400
She was always writing on little pieces of paper, 
which she kept in a locked drawer in her room,  

1178
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:41,599
and every morning she got up surprisingly early 
to go down to the kitchen. I suspected something,  

1179
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:53,680
and one day I decided to break open her drawer. 
In it I was horrified to find a whole pile of  

1180
02:19:53,680 --> 02:20:01,840
love letters from Linton. The two cousins had been 
writing to each other in secret for several weeks,  

1181
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:11,360
and Cathy had used the milkman as a messenger. 
I told her at once that I knew her secret, and  

1182
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:20,160
made her promise not to send or receive any more 
letters. We burnt Linton's letters together.
 
 

1183

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1184
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:28,559
Secret visits

1185
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:42,241
1800 The months passed, and soon it was autumn. Mr 
Edgar caught a bad cold, which seemed to get worse  

1186
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:51,519
and worse. He stayed indoors the whole winter, 
so Cathy only had me as a companion on her walks.  

1187
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:58,880
She had become very quiet and sad since 
her relationship with Linton had ended,  

1188
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:02,640
and was very worried about her father's illness.  

1189
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:10,000
One day when we were walking in the 
Grange garden, I noticed her crying.

1190
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:15,600
'Cathy, what's the matter, love?' I asked.

1191
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:29,280
'Oh, Ellen,' she sobbed, what shall I do if 
Father dies? And if you die? I'll be left alone!'

1192
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:41,121
'I hope he and I have years more of life ahead 
of us. All you need do is look after your father;  

1193
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:48,399
and let him see you're cheerful. 
But I think he would be really ill  

1194
02:21:48,399 --> 02:21:53,839
if he thought you loved Linton, whose 
father would like to see Mr Edgar dead.'

1195
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:03,359
'I'll never, never do anything to 
worry or annoy Father,' she promised.  

1196
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:14,000
I only want him to recover. I love him more than 
anyone else in the world, more than myself!'

1197
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:16,400
Just then  

1198
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:24,640
we reached the gate, and I saw a gentleman on 
a horse looking over it. It was Heathcliff.

1199
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:30,960
'Miss Linton!' he called. 'There's 
something I must tell you!'

1200
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:39,200
'I won't listen,' answered Cathy. Father 
and Ellen both say you're a wicked man.'

1201
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:48,080
'But this is about my son Linton, not 
me. What a trick you played on him!  

1202
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:56,640
You wrote him all those love letters, and then I 
suppose you got tired of it, and stopped! Well,  

1203
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:03,840
you've broken poor Linton's heart. 
I swear, he's dying of love for you,  

1204
02:23:04,479 --> 02:23:12,240
and he'll be in the grave by next summer unless 
you help him! Be generous, come and visit him.  

1205
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:18,319
I'll be away all next week, so your 
father won't be angry if you come.'

1206
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:28,080
He rode away. Although I tried to persuade Cathy 
that Heathcliff could not be telling the truth,  

1207
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:35,120
my young mistress was very upset, and 
determined to discover how Linton was.

1208
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:40,399
The next morning we rode to Wuthering Heights.  

1209
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:49,920
We found Linton alone, lying on a sofa. He 
looked feverish and ill, and had a bad cough.

1210
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:56,399
'Will you shut the door?' he 
said crossly, as we entered.  

1211
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:04,479
'It's so cold! No, Cathy, I can't 
breathe if you kiss me! I want a drink.'

1212
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,479
Cathy poured him a glass of water.

1213
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,840
'And are you glad to see me, 
Linton?' she asked hopefully.

1214
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:22,560
'Yes, I am,' he replied. 'But you should 
have come before! My father swore at me,  

1215
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:27,840
and said it was my fault you didn't 
come. Will you come and visit me again?'

1216
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:37,599
'Yes, Linton,' Cathy said gently, holding 
his hand. If Father agreed, I'd spend half  

1217
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:44,560
my time with you. I wish you were my brother, 
then we could spend all our time together!'

1218
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:52,640
'But my father says you would love me best if 
you were my wife, so that would be better.'

1219
02:24:54,240 --> 02:25:02,800
'I'd never love anybody more than Father,' she 
replied seriously. 'Sometimes men hate their  

1220
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:10,080
wives, like your father. He hated your mother, 
my aunt Isabella. That's why she left him.'

1221
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:21,040
'That's not true!' cried the boy. 'Anyway, your 
mother hated your father! And she loved mine!'

1222
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:30,320
'You're lying! I hate you!' she shouted 
angrily, and gave the sofa a violent push.  

1223
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:38,880
He fell back, and started coughing so 
badly that even I was frightened. At last  

1224
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:46,319
he recovered. Cathy was crying in a corner, 
afraid that she had really hurt him.

1225
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:57,280
'How do you feel now, Linton?' she asked after 
a while. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.'

1226
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:06,880
'I wish you felt as ill as I do, you cruel 
thing! And I was better today, before you came!'  

1227
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:11,040
His voice was full of pity for himself.

1228
02:26:12,319 --> 02:26:16,880
'We must go,' I said. 'You can see, Miss Cathy,  

1229
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:23,440
that he isn't dying of love for you! It's 
not your fault that he's ill. Come along!'  

1230
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:31,040
But I could not stop Cathy whispering something 
in Linton's ear, before we left the room.

1231
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:37,360
On the way home I told her I would 
not allow her to visit him again.

1232
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:44,240
'He's a selfish child, Miss Cathy, and I 
don't think he'll live till he's twenty.  

1233
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:48,240
I'm glad you're not going to marry him.'

1234
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:52,479
'Cathy looked sad. I'm sure he'd recover  

1235
02:26:52,479 --> 02:26:58,080
if I looked after him. And I don't think 
we'd quarrel if we knew each other better.'

1236
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:06,720
'Well, miss, if you try to go there again, 
with or without me, I'll tell your father.'

1237
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:14,880
But the next day I fell ill, and had to 
stay in bed for three weeks, which was  

1238
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:22,319
very unusual for me. My little mistress 
went from her father's bedroom to mine,  

1239
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:30,639
and back again, and looked after us both with 
the greatest care. But I never wondered what  

1240
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:36,560
she did in the evenings, when Mr Edgar had 
gone to bed, and I no longer needed her.

1241
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:46,160
I only discovered the truth on the first day 
I was able to get up. In the evening I asked  

1242
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:55,760
her to read to me, and was surprised how sleepy 
she seemed. She went to bed early. I felt rather  

1243
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:02,320
worried about her health, and went to her room 
an hour later to see if she needed anything.  

1244
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:11,840
Her bedroom was empty. I sat there in 
the dark, waiting for her to return.

1245
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:19,439
When she arrived, shaking the snow off her 
shoes, she was shocked to find me there.  

1246
02:28:20,560 --> 02:28:25,840
I guessed where she had been, but 
I made her tell me the whole story.  

1247
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:34,160
Every night since I had been ill, she had 
ridden to Wuthering Heights and spent the  

1248
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:41,200
evening with her cousin. Sometimes she was 
happy with Linton, when he was cheerful and  

1249
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:48,800
less selfish, but most of the time she 
was miserable. However, she insisted  

1250
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:54,640
that the visits should continue, because 
Linton needed her, and she wanted to see him.

1251
02:28:56,080 --> 02:28:59,120
Although she begged me to 
say nothing to her father,  

1252
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:07,840
I went straight to the master and told him. He 
forbade her to visit Wuthering Heights again.  

1253
02:29:08,479 --> 02:29:12,719
She had to obey her father, 
although it made her very sad.

1254
02:29:14,479 --> 02:29:21,519
Well, Mr Lockwood, all this happened only about 
a year ago. I never thought I would be telling  

1255
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:28,560
a stranger this story! But who knows how long 
you'll be a stranger? You're too young to live  

1256
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:36,880
alone for long, and no one could see Cathy and 
not love her. Anyway, I'll continue my story.'

02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:56,320
A Few days after the master had forbidden Cathy 
to visit Linton, he asked my opinion of the boy.

1261
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:03,840
'Tell me honestly, Ellen, what 
do you think of his character?'

1262
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:09,120
'Well, sir, I don't think 
he's wicked, like his father.  

1263
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,439
But you'll have plenty of time to get to 
know him, sir. He's too young to marry yet.'

1264
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:20,639
Mr Edgar walked to the window and looked out.  

1265
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:27,520
It was a misty February evening, 
but the churchyard was just visible.

1266
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:35,281
'I've often prayed for death, Ellen. I've 
been very happy with my little Cathy.  

1267
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:42,960
But I've been just as happy lying, through 
the long June evenings, on her mother's grave,  

1268
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:47,440
and looking forward to the moment 
when I can join Catherine there!  

1269
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:57,760
I haven't got much time left, Ellen. What can I do 
for Cathy before I die? Should she marry Linton? I  

1270
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:03,600
wouldn't mind him being Heathcliffs son, if only 
he loved her and could be a good husband to her.'

1271
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:09,120
'God will show us what to do, sir,' I replied.

1272
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:17,680
In the spring Mr Edgar was still ill, and 
he continued to worry about Cathy's future.  

1273
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:23,920
One day he wrote to Linton 
inviting him to visit the Grange.  

1274
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:31,759
Linton wrote a long letter back, explaining 
that his father would not allow him to do that.  

1275
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:39,280
He begged his uncle to let him meet Cathy 
for a walk or a ride on the moors between  

1276
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:43,759
the Grange and Wuthering Heights, as 
they could not meet in either house.  

1277
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:51,280
Mr Edgar refused at first, and 
Linton sent him several more letters.  

1278
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:59,920
I am sure they had all been carefully checked 
by Heathcliff before they were posted.

1279
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:08,639
Finally Mr Edgar agreed. He hoped 
that, if Cathy married Linton,  

1280
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:15,120
who would inherit the Linton fortune, she would 
at least be able to remain in her family home.  

1281
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:25,200
He had no idea that Linton was seriously ill. 
Neither did I. I never imagined that a father  

1282
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:32,319
could treat a dying child as cruelly and wickedly 
as we later discovered Heathcliff had done.

1283
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:41,840
It was a hot, sunny day in summer when Cathy 
and I rode out to meet her cousin. We were both  

1284
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:48,160
shocked to discover that he could neither 
ride nor walk, and was lying on the grass,  

1285
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:54,639
waiting for us. He looked even paler and 
weaker than the last time I had seen him.  

1286
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:03,920
During our meeting he did not seem interested in 
Cathy or her news. Cathy noticed this immediately.

1287
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:12,800
'Well, Linton,' she said after a while, you don't 
want to talk to me, so I think I'll go home.'

1288
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:22,559
'No, no!' he cried, getting quite excited. 
'Not yet! Stay - at least another half-hour!  

1289
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,479
My father will be angry 
with me if you leave early!'

1290
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:31,840
'I suppose we can stay a few 
minutes longer,' said Cathy.

1291
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:36,000
We waited, talking to each other quietly  

1292
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:41,840
while Linton slept a little. 
Sometimes he cried out in pain.

1293
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:48,880
'Do you think his health is better 
now than before?' whispered Cathy.

1294
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:54,960
'I'm sorry, Miss Cathy, I think 
it's much worse,' I answered.

1295
02:33:56,160 --> 02:34:00,000
Cathy called her pony, and 
the sound woke Linton up.

1296
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:09,040
'If you see my father,' he said, hesitating, 
'could you tell him I've been cheerful?  

1297
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:15,839
He'll be here soon!' And 
he looked round in terror.

1298
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:23,679
'I'll be here next Thursday!' cried Cathy, 
as she jumped on her pony. Come on, Ellen!'

1299
02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:30,879
In the week that followed, Mr 
Edgar's illness grew worse every day.  

1300
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:39,920
Cathy could not avoid realizing how serious 
it was, and sat by his bedside day and night,  

1301
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:46,800
looking sad and pale. Her father's 
room had become her whole world.  

1302
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:56,240
On Thursday I thought a ride in the fresh air 
would be good for her, and Mr Edgar gladly gave  

1303
02:34:56,240 --> 02:35:02,559
her permission to see Linton. He was hoping that 
she would not be left alone after his death.  

1304
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:11,840
I did not want to worry him in his last moments, 
so I did not tell him that Linton was also dying.

1305
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:19,439
We rode on to the moors and found Linton 
lying in the same place as before.  

1306
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,320
He was looking very frightened.

1307
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:27,200
'I thought you weren't going to come!' he said.

1308
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:36,479
'Why won't you be honest?' cried Cathy at 
once. 'Why have you brought me here again,  

1309
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:42,160
if you don't want to see me? My father's 
very ill and I should be with him.'

1310
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:49,040
Tears rolled down Linton's 
face. He seemed terrified.

1311
02:35:50,560 --> 02:36:01,520
'Oh, I can't bear it!' he sobbed. Cathy, I daren't 
explain! But if you leave me, he'll kill me!  

1312
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:11,920
Dear Cathy, my life is in your hands! 
Kind, sweet Cathy, perhaps you will agree,  

1313
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:14,400
and then he won't hurt me!'

1314
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:23,680
Cathy was no longer impatient. 'Agree 
to what, Linton?' she asked gently.  

1315
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:32,080
'Tell me everything! You wouldn't do anything to 
hurt me, would you, Linton? I'm your best friend.'

1316
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:45,440
'I daren't tell you! My father-' the boy gasped. 
Just then Heathcliff appeared. He did not look  

1317
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:51,759
at Cathy and Linton, who continued talking 
to each other, but he spoke quietly to me.

1318
02:36:53,760 --> 02:37:00,000
'Ellen, how is Edgar? Is he 
dying, as the villagers say?'

1319
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,120
'It's true, the master is dying,' I answered.

1320
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:18,320
'That boy over there is dying too. I only hope 
Edgar dies before him. If Linton dies first,  

1321
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:27,679
my plan will fail.' He shouted angrily to his son, 
Get up, Linton!' and then said politely to Cathy,  

1322
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:36,000
'Miss Cathy, would you help him back 
to the house. He can't walk far alone.'

1323
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:42,399
'Father has forbidden me to 
enter your house,' said Cathy.

1324
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:49,201
'Well, come along, Linton. I'll have to 
take you home then,' said Heathcliff.

1325
02:37:50,319 --> 02:37:58,000
'No! No! No! Please, Cathy! You must 
come with me!' screamed Linton wildly.  

1326
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
He held desperately on to her arm.

1327
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:08,799
Cathy could not refuse the boy, who 
seemed almost mad with fear. So we all  

1328
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:14,880
walked the few steps to Wuthering Heights. 
When we had entered the house, however,  

1329
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:22,880
I was horrified to see Heathcliff lock 
the front door. The key was in his hand.

1330
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:36,000
'Hareton, Joseph and Zillah are all out of the 
house,' he said calmly, so we are quite alone.'

1331
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:43,360
'Give me that key!' cried Cathy 
angrily. 'I'm not afraid of you!'  

1332
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:52,480
She took hold of his closed hand and bit 
it. He hit her violently several times, on  

1333
02:38:52,479 --> 02:39:00,399
both sides of the head, and she fell into a chair, 
trembling. I rushed at him, but he pushed me away.

1334
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:11,200
'Cry as much as you like, Miss Cathy,' he 
said. 'In a few days I'll be your father,  

1335
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:17,200
and I'll punish you just like 
that, as often as necessary!'

1336
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:22,080
When Heathcliff went out to look for our horses,  

1337
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:27,120
Cathy and I hurried round the 
kitchen looking for a way to escape.  

1338
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:35,200
But all the doors and windows were locked. Linton 
was sitting calmly in a chair near the fire,  

1339
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:44,080
happy that he was not being punished this time. We 
persuaded him to explain his father's plan to us.

1340
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:53,359
'Father is afraid I'll die soon, you see, so 
he wants us to be married tomorrow morning.  

1341
02:39:54,160 --> 02:40:00,240
You'll have to stay here all night, Cathy. Then 
perhaps he'll let you go home in the morning.'

1342
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:12,640
'You marry this beautiful, healthy young lady?' 
I cried. You must be mad! And wicked too! You and  

1343
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:19,840
your father have tricked us into coming here!' 
And I shook him until he started coughing.

1344
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:28,080
'I must go home now. Father will 
be worried already,' said Cathy.  

1345
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:32,000
I love Father better than you, Linton!'

1346
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:37,920
Heathcliff returned and sent 
his son upstairs to bed.

1347
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:46,320
'Mr Heathcliff,' begged Cathy, 'Father 
will be miserable if I don't go home.  

1348
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:54,880
Please let me go. I promise to marry Linton. 
Father would like it, and I love him.  

1349
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:59,439
Why do you force me to do something I want to do?'

1350
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:06,319
'He can't force you!' I cried. 
'I'll go to the police!'

1351
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:14,319
'To the devil with you, Ellen! Miss 
Cathy, I'm delighted that your father  

1352
02:41:14,319 --> 02:41:20,399
will be miserable. In that case you will 
certainly stay here for twenty-four hours.  

1353
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:26,000
You won't leave here until you've 
kept your promise to marry Linton.'

1354
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:33,279
'Please send Ellen to let Father know 
I'm safe!' sobbed Cathy bitterly.  

1355
02:41:34,319 --> 02:41:37,759
'Poor Father! He'll think we're lost!'

1356
02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:43,839
'Your father must have hated 
you when you came into the world  

1357
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:52,320
(I did, at least), and he'll hate you as he 
leaves it. Go on crying. That's what you'll  

1358
02:41:52,319 --> 02:41:58,880
be doing when you're Linton's wife. He'll 
make a cruel, selfish husband, I think.'

1359
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:08,160
Heathcliff took us upstairs to Zillah's room, 
where we spent the night, locked in. Neither of  

1360
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:17,120
us could sleep. At seven the following morning 
he came to fetch Cathy, and took her away. From  

1361
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:25,840
that moment I saw nobody except Hareton, who 
brought me food, for four whole days and nights.

1362
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:34,000
On the fifth morning Zillah came into the 
room. She was surprised and pleased to see me,  

1363
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:40,640
and told me the villagers all thought 
Cathy and I had got lost on the moors,  

1364
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:47,040
and died, four days ago. I ran 
out of the room to look for Cathy.

1365
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:56,800
The big kitchen was full of sunshine, and the door 
was open, but the only person there was Linton.

1366
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:03,120
'Where is she? Where is 
Miss Cathy?' I cried wildly.

1367
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:10,000
'Upstairs, in a locked room,' he 
replied calmly, eating a piece of sugar.  

1368
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:18,479
'We won't let her go yet. Father says I shouldn't 
be soft with Cathy. We've had the wedding  

1369
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:26,399
ceremony, so she's my wife now, and must stay 
with me. I don't care if she cries, or is ill!'

1370
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:34,640
'Have you forgotten her kindness to you last 
winter, when you wrote that you loved her,  

1371
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:42,639
and she used to come through wind and snow to see 
you? Now you believe your father's lies about her!  

1372
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:50,960
And you leave her alone, ill and crying 
in a strange house! You pity yourself,  

1373
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:56,720
but you won't pity her! What a 
heartless, selfish boy you are!'

1374
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:07,920
'I can't stay with her! She cries so much I can't 
bear it! I can't sleep with all that noise. She  

1375
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:15,120
promised that if I gave her the key to our room, 
she'd give me all her nice books, and her pony,  

1376
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:22,960
but I told her she had nothing to give. They're 
all mine, or they'll belong to me very soon.  

1377
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:32,720
And then she cried, and took a little gold case 
from around her neck. Inside were two pictures,  

1378
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:40,559
one of her mother and one of her father. I wanted 
to take them both from her, but she wouldn't let  

1379
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:49,280
me, so I screamed for help. My father came, and 
ordered her to give him the pictures and the case.  

1380
02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:56,960
When she refused, he - he hit her 
on the face and knocked her down,  

1381
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:03,440
and broke the gold case under his foot. 
He took away the picture of her mother.'

1382
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:10,160
'And were you pleased to see 
Miss Cathy hurt?' I asked.

1383
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:17,519
'My father was right to punish her. But I 
didn't like seeing her mouth full of blood.  

1384
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:24,161
She can't speak because of the pain. Now 
you've made me tired with all this talking!  

1385
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,840
You won't find the key to the room! Go away!'

1386
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:34,479
As there seemed to be no chance of 
persuading him to help her escape,  

1387
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:41,839
I decided to go back to the Grange as 
quickly as possible, and rescue her later.

1388
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:50,160
What a welcome I received from the servants 
at the Grange, who thought I was dead! But  

1389
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:58,880
I did not have time to tell them my story. I went 
straight to my master's room. He was lying in bed,  

1390
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:06,240
very weak and close to death. I told 
him how Heathcliff had trapped us,  

1391
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:15,279
and that Cathy was probably married to Linton 
by now. Mr Edgar realized that his enemy  

1392
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:21,840
wanted to get hold of the Linton 
fortune, through his son. He asked me  

1393
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:28,160
to send for his lawyer, to make arrangements so 
that Cathy would not lose all her inheritance.

1394
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:36,240
I did as he asked, but the lawyer sent a message, 
saying that he could not come until the next day.  

1395
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:43,600
I also sent four strong men with 
weapons to Wuthering Heights,  

1396
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:50,400
to demand my young lady's freedom. I was 
very angry when they returned without her,  

1397
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:53,359
because Heathcliff had sent them away.

1398
02:46:54,640 --> 02:47:01,680
But I needn't have worried. In the middle of the 
night, as I was taking some water to the master,  

1399
02:47:02,479 --> 02:47:09,040
I heard a knock on the front door, and 
went to open it. It was my little mistress!

1400
02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:16,160
'Ellen, Ellen!' she sobbed. 
'Is Father still alive?'

1401
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:21,279
'Yes,' I cried, 'and thank God 
you're safe with us again!'

1402
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:29,279
'I managed to make Linton help me escape 
from the room! Now I must see Father!'

1403
02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:38,080
'I could not bear to be present at their 
meeting. I waited outside the bedroom door.  

1404
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:49,040
But they were both calm. Cathy's despair was 
as silent as her father's happiness. He died  

1405
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:54,960
in perfect peace, Mr Lockwood. 
Kissing her, he whispered,  

1406
02:47:56,800 --> 02:48:08,320
I'm going to join her, and you, dear child, 
will join us!' He did not move or speak again.

1407
02:48:10,399 --> 02:48:18,319
Cathy did not cry, but sat silently by 
his dead body all morning. At lunch-time  

1408
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:26,240
the lawyer arrived, too late to help Cathy. 
Heathcliff had bribed him to stay away.  

1409
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:34,240
He gave us Heathcliffs orders. All 
the servants except me had to leave.  

1410
02:48:35,359 --> 02:48:43,839
Cathy, Mrs Heathcliff now, was only allowed to 
stay at the Grange until her father was buried.
 
 

1411
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,120
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1412
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:51,519
Cathy becomes a widow

1413
02:48:53,279 --> 02:49:03,359
1800-1 On the evening after the 
burial, Heathcliff came to fetch Cathy.

1414
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:08,800
'Why not let her stay here with me?' I begged.

1415
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:14,080
'I'm looking for someone to 
rent the Grange from me,'  

1416
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:18,880
he answered. 'You'll stay on 
here as housekeeper, Ellen,  

1417
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:25,840
but Cathy must come to Wuthering Heights. 
From now on she'll have to work for her food.'

1418
02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:36,080
'I shall work,' replied Cathy. And I'll look after 
Linton. He's all I've got to love in the world.  

1419
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:43,920
I'm just sorry for you, Mr Heathcliff. 
You have nobody to love you! You are as  

1420
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:54,240
lonely and miserable as the devil! Nobody will 
cry for you when you die! I'm glad I'm not you!'

1421
02:49:54,240 --> 02:50:00,800
'Go and get your clothes, you wicked girl,' 
he said. 'We'll be leaving in a few minutes.'  

1422
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:05,920
When she had gone, he walked across the room  

1423
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:10,800
to look at the picture of Cathy's mother, 
Catherine, which was hanging on the wall.

1424
02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:19,599
'Do you know what I did yesterday, Ellen?' he 
said, turning quickly away from the picture.  

1425
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:28,560
'I went to the churchyard, and asked the man 
who was digging Edgar's grave to open the lid  

1426
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:38,000
of Catherine's coffin for me. Her face looked 
just the same! I could not stop looking at her.  

1427
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:47,600
When the man closed the lid, I broke open one side 
of her coffin, the side away from Edgar's grave,  

1428
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:56,800
and covered it up with earth. And I bribed the 
man to bury me there when I die, next to her,  

1429
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:07,360
and to take the side of my coffin away too, so 
that I shall have her in my arms, not Edgar!'

1430
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:14,479
'You were very wicked, Mr 
Heathcliff, to disturb the dead!'

1431
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:25,200
'I disturbed nobody, Ellen, and I feel much 
happier now. She is the one who has disturbed me.  

1432
02:51:26,399 --> 02:51:36,559
For eighteen years she has haunted me. You know I 
was wild, almost mad, after she died. For days I  

1433
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:44,720
prayed for her ghost to return to me. On the day 
of her burial, I went to her grave in the evening.  

1434
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:55,840
There was a bitter wind, and snow on the ground. I 
wanted so much to have her in my arms again! So I  

1435
02:51:55,840 --> 02:52:04,000
dug down through the loose earth to her coffin, 
and was about to pull the lid off, when I felt  

1436
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:14,640
a warm breath on my face. She seemed to be with 
me, not in the earth, but close to me. I was  

1437
02:52:15,200 --> 02:52:23,040
so happy that she was with me again! I filled in 
the grave, and ran eagerly home to the Heights.  

1438
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:30,160
I looked impatiently round for her. I 
could feel her but I could not see her!  

1439
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:36,240
And since then, she has played 
plenty of tricks on me like that.  

1440
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:43,520
When I sleep in her bedroom, I can hear her 
outside the window, or entering the room,  

1441
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:53,359
or even breathing close to me, but when I 
open my eyes, I'm always disappointed. Slowly,  

1442
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:59,519
slowly, she's killing me, with the ghost 
of a hope that's lasted eighteen years!'

1443
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:04,960
He was talking almost to himself,  

1444
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:12,000
so I did not answer. When Cathy 
came in, he stood up, ready to go.

1445
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:19,680
'Goodbye, Ellen!' whispered my dear 
little mistress. 'Come and visit me!'  

1446
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:25,360
As she kissed me, her face felt as cold as ice.

1447
02:53:26,800 --> 02:53:29,520
'Oh, no you won't, Ellen!'  

1448
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:37,840
said Heathcliff. I'll send for you if I want 
you!' and together they left the Grange.

1449
02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:46,960
I haven't seen Cathy since then. Once I went 
to the Heights to visit her, but I was not  

1450
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:55,040
allowed to see her. About six weeks ago I had a 
long conversation with Zillah, the housekeeper,  

1451
02:53:55,040 --> 02:54:03,279
who gave me news of Cathy. It appeared that, when 
she arrived at the Heights, she did her best to  

1452
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:09,840
look after her sick husband. He was obviously 
dying, although Heathcliff refused to call the  

1453
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:19,840
doctor. Only a few weeks after her arrival, Linton 
died in the night, with only Cathy by his bedside.  

1454
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:30,000
Heathcliff inherited all of Linton's, and what had 
been Cathy's, fortune, so Cathy is now very poor.

1455
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:36,800
She must be very miserable, and very 
lonely, in that dark, unpleasant house.  

1456
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:44,160
Heathcliff hates her, and Joseph and Zillah don't 
speak to her, because they think she's too proud.  

1457
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:51,520
Poor Hareton would like to be friendly with 
her, but she scorns him because he's uneducated.  

1458
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:59,680
I would like to leave my job here, rent a little 
cottage and ask Cathy to come and live with me,  

1459
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:02,800
but Mr Heathcliff will never permit that.  

1460
02:55:04,319 --> 02:55:15,840
Of course, if she married again, she could 
leave that house, but I can't arrange that.
 
 

1461
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:17,760
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1462
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:22,000
Mr Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights again

1463
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:32,720
1802 After hearing the end of Mrs Dean's 
story, I made my plans for the future.  

1464
02:55:34,160 --> 02:55:39,120
I decided I did not want to spend another 
winter at the Grange, and told her I would  

1465
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:47,200
ride to the Heights to inform my landlord. She 
handed me a letter to give to Cathy Heathcliff.

1466
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:56,800
When I arrived at the gate, Hareton met me 
and took me into the house. Cathy was there,  

1467
02:55:57,600 --> 02:56:02,241
preparing vegetables for lunch. 
She did not bother to greet me.

1468
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:09,440
'She may be beautiful,' I thought, 
'but she's not very polite.'  

1469
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:16,480
I passed by her chair, and cleverly 
dropped Mrs Dean's note in front of her,  

1470
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:24,479
so that Hareton wouldn't see it. She, 
however, just said aloud, 'What's that?'

1471
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:30,560
'A letter from the housekeeper at the 
Grange,' I said, annoyed with her.  

1472
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:36,880
She gasped, and tried to pick it 
up, but Hareton got there first.

1473
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:44,559
'Mr Heathcliff will want to look at 
this,' he said, putting it in his pocket.  

1474
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:51,200
But when Cathy pretended to cry, 
Hareton could not bear to make her sad,  

1475
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:53,840
and he threw the letter down on the table.  

1476
02:56:55,760 --> 02:57:02,080
She eagerly read every word, and asked me 
several questions about the people at the Grange.

1477
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:08,880
'Mrs Dean will want an answer 
to her letter,' I reminded her.

1478
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:15,920
'You must tell her that I have 
no paper or pens to write with.  

1479
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:21,840
I haven't even any books!' she answered sadly.

1480
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:29,920
'No books!' I cried. 'How can you manage 
without them in this lonely place?'

1481
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:38,960
'I always used to read so much that Mr 
Heathcliff decided to take away my only pleasure  

1482
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:44,880
and destroy my books. I've looked 
all over the house for them.  

1483
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:52,081
Joseph only reads the Bible, but some 
of my books are in Hareton's room!  

1484
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:03,840
Why did you take them, Hareton? Just because you 
enjoy stealing? They can't be any use to you!'

1485
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:11,439
'I think Mr Hareton wants to learn,' I said, 
hoping to prevent a quarrel between them.  

1486
02:58:13,120 --> 02:58:15,840
'No doubt he took them away to study them.'

1487
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:25,121
'Yes,' replied Cathy, laughing. 'I hear 
him trying to read to himself sometimes  

1488
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:31,840
and it's extremely funny! He 
makes some terrible mistakes!'

1489
02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:40,000
After a moment's shocked silence Hareton left 
the room. He returned almost immediately with  

1490
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:45,840
his arms full of books, and threw 
them angrily down at Cathy's feet.

1491
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:52,479
'Take them!' he shouted. 'I 
never want to see them again!'

1492
02:58:54,880 --> 02:59:02,400
'I won't have them now,' she said. 'I'll hate 
them because they'll make me think of you.'

1493
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:14,319
Hareton picked up the books and threw them on 
the fire, then walked quickly out of the house.

1494
02:59:14,319 --> 02:59:21,759
Mr Heathcliff came in as Hareton went out. He 
had a restless, anxious expression on his face.

1495
02:59:24,479 --> 02:59:30,639
'Mr Heathcliff,' I said, 'I must tell 
you I'm leaving for London next week,  

1496
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:36,879
for six months, and I shan't want to 
rent the Grange any more after October.'

1497
02:59:38,960 --> 02:59:48,560
'So, Mr Lockwood, you've got tired of the 
moors already, have you? Well, have your lunch  

1498
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:57,040
with Hareton and me, anyway. Cathy, take your 
lunch in the kitchen with Joseph and Zillah.'

1499
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:03,200
I did not enjoy lunch with 
my two silent companions,  

1500
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:06,479
and left the Heights straight afterwards.

1501
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:14,319
'What a pity,' I thought, 'that Cathy 
Heathcliff and I didn't fall in love,  

1502
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:23,840
as Mrs Dean would have liked! Then I could have 
taken her away from this miserable place forever!'

1503
03:00:24,399 --> 03:00:30,000
Several months later, in September, I was 
travelling to visit friends in Yorkshire.  

1504
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:36,479
I found myself near Thrushcross Grange, 
and decided to spend a night there.  

1505
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:45,840
After all, I was still paying rent for it. 
When I arrived, I was surprised to find a  

1506
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:54,400
different housekeeper, who told me Mrs Dean had 
become housekeeper at the Heights. I wanted to  

1507
03:00:54,399 --> 03:01:00,080
have a walk after travelling all day, so I 
left orders for the woman to cook my supper  

1508
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:06,161
and prepare a bedroom for me, and I walked 
the four miles to Wuthering Heights.

1509
03:01:08,800 --> 03:01:14,400
As I came close to the old house, I noticed 
that there were flowers in the garden,  

1510
03:01:15,120 --> 03:01:23,680
and the doors and windows stood open. I could see 
two people inside, and I stopped for a moment,  

1511
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:27,279
curious to hear a little of their conversation.

1512
03:01:28,960 --> 03:01:33,840
'Read it again, stupid!' said a 
voice as sweet as a silver bell.  

1513
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:38,559
'Read it correctly this time, 
or I'll pull your hair!'

1514
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:44,480
'You must kiss me if I get it 
right,' answered a deep voice.  

1515
03:01:46,399 --> 03:01:53,599
The man was sitting at a table, reading from 
a book. His handsome face shone with pleasure,  

1516
03:01:54,479 --> 03:02:01,839
and his eyes often left the book to look at 
the small white hand that lay on his shoulder.  

1517
03:02:02,720 --> 03:02:12,080
The girl stood behind him, bending over to help 
him. Her face - it was fortunate he could not  

1518
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:19,439
see her face, or he would never have been able 
to concentrate on his studies. I could see it,  

1519
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:29,840
and I was bitterly sorry that I had thrown away my 
chance of seeing that beauty every day of my life.

1520
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:32,800
I did not want to disturb their happiness,  

1521
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:39,040
so I went round to the back door, where 
I discovered my old friend Ellen Dean.

1522
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:49,680
'Oh, Mr Lockwood, welcome back!' she cried. 
'Are you staying at the Grange again?'

1523
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:54,560
'Yes, Mrs Dean, just for one night.  

1524
03:02:55,920 --> 03:03:01,120
But tell me, why are you housekeeper 
here now and not at the Grange?'

1525
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:08,160
'Zillah left, you see, and Mr 
Heathcliff wanted me here.'

1526
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:13,679
'I have a little business 
with him, about the rent.'

1527
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:22,000
'Oh! Mr Heathcliff is dead, 
sir. He died three months ago.  

1528
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:31,520
I manage all Mrs Heathcliffs business for her. 
She hasn't learnt to do it herself yet, you see.'

1529
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:43,359
'Heathcliff is dead!' I repeated, surprised. 
'Well! Tell me how it happened, Mrs Dean!'

1530
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:57,280
'Sit down, sir, and drink some beer. I'll gladly 
tell you. His life ended very strangely.'
 
 

1531
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:02,720
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

1532
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:04,960
Heathcliffs end

1533
03:04:06,479 --> 03:04:17,439
1801-2 I was delighted to come back to the 
Heights, and hoped I could make Cathy's life more  

1534
03:04:17,439 --> 03:04:26,399
comfortable. But she was restless, and complained 
of loneliness. At first she continued to annoy  

1535
03:04:26,399 --> 03:04:33,759
Hareton, by laughing at him, but after a while 
she decided she really wanted him as a friend.  

1536
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:40,560
She apologized for being rude to him, and 
offered to teach him everything she knew.  

1537
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:48,000
From that moment on, the two cousins 
have always been together, studying.  

1538
03:04:49,439 --> 03:04:57,759
Hareton has a lot to learn, and Cathy is not the 
most patient of teachers. But what they have in  

1539
03:04:57,760 --> 03:05:05,360
common is their love for each other. You see, Mr 
Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Cathy's heart.  

1540
03:05:06,080 --> 03:05:13,120
But now I'm glad you didn't try. I'll be the 
happiest woman in England when those two marry!

1541
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:18,720
Heathcliff noticed little of 
what was happening around him,  

1542
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:26,080
and would never have been aware of the cousins' 
feelings, if it hadn't been for Joseph. In the  

1543
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:32,640
middle of our lunch one day, the old man 
rushed into the room, shaking with anger.

1544
03:05:34,640 --> 03:05:42,800
'I'll have to leave! I wanted to die here, 
where I've been a servant for sixty years!  

1545
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:52,800
But now she's taken my garden from me! She's 
stolen the boy's soul, master! I can't bear it!'

1546
03:05:54,240 --> 03:06:00,719
'Is the fool drunk?' asked Heathcliff. 
Can you explain this, Hareton?'

1547
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:08,720
'I've pulled up two or three of his fruit-trees,' 
confessed Hareton, but I'll put them back again.'

1548
03:06:10,160 --> 03:06:15,120
'It was my fault,' added Cathy 
bravely. I asked him to do it.  

1549
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,920
We wanted to plant some flowers there.'

1550
03:06:19,840 --> 03:06:24,400
'Who the devil gave you 
permission?' growled Heathcliff.

1551
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:31,440
'You should let me have a bit of garden, as 
you've taken all my land!' replied Cathy sharply.  

1552
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:38,720
And you've taken Hareton's land too! He and 
I are friends now! I'll tell him about you!'

1553
03:06:40,479 --> 03:06:43,679
The master stood up, staring at her fiercely.

1554
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:51,040
'Out of the room, wicked girl!' he 
shouted. I'll kill you if I get near you!'

1555
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:57,519
'If you hit me, Hareton will hit 
you. He won't obey you anymore,  

1556
03:06:58,080 --> 03:07:00,960
and soon he'll hate you as much as I do!'

1557
03:07:02,319 --> 03:07:09,840
'You'd better leave, Cathy,' whispered Hareton 
urgently. 'I won't quarrel with Mr Heathcliff.'

1558
03:07:09,840 --> 03:07:17,520
But it was too late. I was sure Heathcliff 
was going to hit her. He took hold of her,  

1559
03:07:18,080 --> 03:07:25,279
one strong hand in her hair and the other raised 
over her head. But when he looked into her face,  

1560
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:33,600
his anger suddenly disappeared, and he 
let his arm fall to his side. He sat  

1561
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:40,880
heavily down in his chair and put his hand over 
his eyes for a moment. We all stared at him.

1562
03:07:43,439 --> 03:07:52,399
You must learn not to make me angry,' 
he said, trying to be calm. Go away,  

1563
03:07:52,399 --> 03:08:01,519
all of you! Leave me alone!' A little later he 
went out, saying he would return in the evening.

1564
03:08:03,439 --> 03:08:09,200
As darkness fell, Cathy and Hareton were 
busy at their studies in the kitchen.  

1565
03:08:10,240 --> 03:08:14,639
I was sitting with them, happy to 
see them helping each other so well.  

1566
03:08:15,680 --> 03:08:21,920
I feel they're almost my children, Mr 
Lockwood, and I'm very proud of them. As  

1567
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:29,120
the master entered the house, he had a full view 
of us three. They lifted their eyes to meet his.  

1568
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:37,920
Perhaps you haven't noticed it, but their eyes 
are very similar, and they are exactly like those  

1569
03:08:37,920 --> 03:08:47,920
of Catherine Earnshaw. Mr Heathcliff stopped 
and stared, then looked away. At a sign from me,  

1570
03:08:47,920 --> 03:08:53,920
Cathy and Hareton went quietly out into the 
garden, leaving me alone with Mr Heathcliff.

1571
03:08:56,399 --> 03:09:04,719
'It's silly, isn't it, Ellen,' he muttered, 
'that I have worked all my life to destroy  

1572
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:12,480
these two families, the Earnshaws and the 
Lintons. I've got their money and their land.  

1573
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:21,600
Now I can take my final revenge on the last 
Earnshaw and the last Linton, I no longer want to!  

1574
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:31,200
There's a strange change coming in my life. I'm 
in its shadow. I'm so little interested in daily  

1575
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:38,239
events that I even forget to eat and drink. 
I don't want to see those two, that's why I  

1576
03:09:38,239 --> 03:09:45,760
don't care if they spend time together. She only 
makes me angry. And he looks so like Catherine!  

1577
03:09:46,960 --> 03:09:54,640
But everything reminds me of Catherine! In 
every cloud, in every tree I see her face!  

1578
03:09:56,000 --> 03:10:01,279
The whole world reminds me that she 
was here once, and I have lost her!'

1579
03:10:03,359 --> 03:10:08,319
'You don't feel ill, sir, do 
you? Are you afraid of death?'

1580
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:16,399
I'm not ill, Ellen, and I'm not afraid 
to die. But I can't continue like this!  

1581
03:10:17,279 --> 03:10:22,960
I have to remind myself to breathe 
- almost to remind my heart to beat!  

1582
03:10:24,319 --> 03:10:31,439
I have a single wish, for something 
my whole body and heart and brain  

1583
03:10:31,439 --> 03:10:39,839
have wanted for so long! Oh God! It's 
a long fight! I wish it were finished!'

1584
03:10:41,279 --> 03:10:48,399
For some days after that, Mr Heathcliff 
avoided meeting us at meals. He ate less  

1585
03:10:48,399 --> 03:10:56,479
and less. Late one night I heard him leave the 
house. He did not return until the morning.  

1586
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:01,520
When he came in, I noticed 
a change in his expression.  

1587
03:11:02,560 --> 03:11:09,040
There was a strange, wild happiness in his 
face, although he was pale and trembling.

1588
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:12,800
'Will you have some breakfast, sir?' I asked.

1589
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,800
'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered.

1590
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:24,160
'I don't think you should stay outside at 
night, sir. You'll catch a bad cold or a fever!'

1591
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:28,960
'Leave me alone, Ellen,' he replied.

1592
03:11:30,239 --> 03:11:37,519
I began to worry about him. He was strong and 
healthy, but a man must eat in order to live.  

1593
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:47,279
For the next three days he ate nothing. At every 
meal the food lay untouched on the plate in front  

1594
03:11:47,279 --> 03:11:55,679
of him. He did not look at the food, or at us. 
He seemed to be looking at something quite close  

1595
03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:04,880
to him, something we could not see. His fierce 
black eyes followed it with such eager interest  

1596
03:12:04,880 --> 03:12:08,560
that he sometimes stopped breathing 
for as much as half a minute.

1597
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:17,519
He did not sleep either. For three days he had 
spent the night in Catherine Earnshaw's old  

1598
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:25,520
bedroom, and I could hear him walking up and 
down, and talking, calling, crying all night.

1599
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:34,720
One morning I managed to speak to him, 
and make him listen to me. Mr Heathcliff,  

1600
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:42,880
you must have some food and sleep. Look at 
yourself in the mirror! You look ill and tired.'

1601
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:50,880
'It's not my fault that I can't eat or 
rest. You wouldn't tell a drowning man to  

1602
03:12:50,880 --> 03:12:57,279
rest when he can see the shore! I'm close 
to what I've wanted for eighteen years,  

1603
03:12:58,080 --> 03:13:03,600
very close! But my soul's 
happiness is killing my body!'

1604
03:13:05,359 --> 03:13:12,639
'It's a strange kind of happiness, 
master. Take my advice, and pray to God  

1605
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:17,520
to forgive you for what you've done wrong in 
the past, if you think you're going to die.'

1606
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:25,679
'Thank you, Ellen, you've reminded me of 
something. It's the way I want to be buried.  

1607
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:34,720
My coffin will be carried to the churchyard in 
the evening. You and Hareton will be present,  

1608
03:13:34,720 --> 03:13:40,640
nobody else. And make sure my orders 
about the two coffins are obeyed!  

1609
03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:46,640
I want no ceremony, or words from the 
Bible - I don't believe in any of that.'

1610
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:55,600
He spent the next night, and the next day, in 
Catherine's room, muttering and sobbing all  

1611
03:13:55,600 --> 03:14:02,960
the time. I sent for Dr Kenneth, but the door 
was locked, so the doctor could not see him.  

1612
03:14:04,239 --> 03:14:08,319
The following night was 
very wet, and in the morning  

1613
03:14:08,319 --> 03:14:13,519
as I walked in the garden, I noticed 
that the bedroom window was wide open.

1614
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:19,840
'He must be very wet if he's in bed,' 
I thought, the bed is so close to the  

1615
03:14:19,840 --> 03:14:28,080
window. I'll go and look.' I found another key 
which fitted the lock, and opened the door.  

1616
03:14:29,279 --> 03:14:32,960
Mr Heathcliff was there in bed, lying on his back.  

1617
03:14:34,319 --> 03:14:41,200
His eyes were staring at me, so eagerly 
and fiercely, and he seemed to be smiling!  

1618
03:14:42,479 --> 03:14:51,839
His face and clothes were wet from the rain, 
and he did not move. I realized he was dead!

1619
03:14:53,279 --> 03:14:59,359
I closed the window. I combed his 
long, black hair from his forehead.  

1620
03:15:00,880 --> 03:15:09,840
I tried to close his eyes, but they would not 
shut. Suddenly frightened, I called for Joseph.  

1621
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:15,600
The old servant came at once, 
but refused to touch the body.

1622
03:15:17,439 --> 03:15:25,200
'Ah, the devil's taken his soul! I 
warned him that would happen!' he cried.  

1623
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:36,239
'You see how wicked he is, smiling at death! But 
thank God Hareton Earnshaw will have the house and  

1624
03:15:36,239 --> 03:15:44,719
land now, that he should have inherited from his 
father!' And he went down on his knees to pray.

1625
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:55,520
Hareton was, in fact, the only one who was sad at 
Heathcliffs death. He and I were present at the  

1626
03:15:55,520 --> 03:16:04,640
burial. Heathcliff was buried next to Catherine's 
grave, as he had wished. As we were not sure  

1627
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:13,680
of his age or anything else about him, there is 
only one word on his gravestone - Heathcliff. The  

1628
03:16:13,680 --> 03:16:20,800
villagers are very frightened of his ghost. They 
say he often haunts the churchyard and the moors.

1629
03:16:22,720 --> 03:16:29,840
Hareton and Cathy will be married on New 
Year's Day, and they'll move to the Grange.  

1630
03:16:30,399 --> 03:16:35,200
I'll be their housekeeper. Joseph 
will take care of Wuthering Heights,  

1631
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,640
but most of the rooms here won't be used again.

1632
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:46,239
You'll pass the churchyard, Mr Lockwood, on 
your way back to the Grange, and you'll see  

1633
03:16:46,239 --> 03:16:53,599
the three gravestones close to the moor. 
Catherine's, the middle one, is old now,  

1634
03:16:53,600 --> 03:17:00,000
and half buried in plants which have grown 
over it. On one side is Edgar Linton's,  

1635
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:08,480
and on the other is Heathcliffs new one. If 
you stay there a moment, and watch the insects  

1636
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:14,479
flying in the warm summer air, and listen to 
the soft wind breathing through the grass,  

1637
03:17:15,439 --> 03:17:26,279
you'll understand how quietly they rest, 
the sleepers in that quiet earth.
 
 
 
 

1638
03:17:26,279 --> 03:17:27,629
- THE END -
