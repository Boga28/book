00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,060
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,160
Control!

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,970
'Golf Bravo Alpha.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,910
You are cleared for take-off.'

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,450
Eighteen-year-old Swiss-Italian, Francesca
Bartolli, sat in the small single-engined

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,169
Cessna 152 and stared through the window at
the runway ahead.

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:27,740
A white dotted line stretched down the middle
of the concrete far into the distance.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,259
Had the moment finally arrived?

9
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,950
Was she really going to pilot a plane at last?

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,870
'Well?' said a voice in her headphones.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,970
'What are you waiting for?'

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,680
It was Doug, the flying instructor, in the
seat beside her.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,050
Francesca felt hot.

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,300
The sun was shining brightly through the windscreen,
turning the plane's small cockpit into an

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,550
oven.

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,900
And the headphones were tight and painful
on her ears.

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,400
'You mean you want me to...' she began.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,930
'Push the throttle in smoothly and hold the
control column steady,' the instructor said.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,960
'When I tell you, just pull back gently.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,780
I'll do all the rest.'

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,729
'OK,' Francesca answered in a shaky voice.

22
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,890
Doug called the control tower for permission
to take off, but Francesca didn't take in

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,890
what he said.

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,219
Now that the moment had finally arrived, she
suddenly wondered if it was really what she

25
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,020
wanted.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,549
The instructor's voice became firmer.

27
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,590
'Right, let's go!' he said.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,219
Francesca didn't hesitate now.

29
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:47,109
Setting her mouth with new determination,
she stretched out her right arm and pushed

30
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,299
carefully on the throttle.

31
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:54,320
Immediately, the engine roared and the little
aircraft seemed to sit up.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,359
The next moment it was being pulled forward
as if on a huge elastic band.

33
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,969
Within a couple of seconds, they were already
racing along the runway.

34
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,649
The white dotted lines began disappearing
quickly below the nose of the plane.

35
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,519
'Keep your eye on the airspeed dial,' she
heard the instructor say in her headphones

36
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,680
again, above the roar of the engine.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,140
'When the needle reaches 60, pull back gently.'

38
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Francesca didn't answer.

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,500
There was so much to look at, so much going
on.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,920
It seemed somehow crazy, this race down the
runway.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,250
She watched the needle going round the dial:
40... 45...

42
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,319
The white dotted lines on the runway flashed
below the plane.

43
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,129
Her head felt as if it was bursting.

44
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,640
All of a sudden, the needle was at 60.

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,010
'Right, pull back!' came Doug's voice.

46
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,049
But already Francesca was pulling back on
the control column.

47
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:03,439
It was much lighter than she expected, just
like pulling your hand slowly through cream.

48
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,940
Straightaway the nose of the aircraft lifted
and the runway disappeared from view.

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,329
The next moment she felt the plane rise into
the air.

50
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:17,579
'OK, hold it there!' said Doug.

51
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,340
Francesca felt a strange smile pull at the
sides of her mouth.

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,900
She couldn't help it.

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,120
They were flying!

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,599
'That's enough!

55
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,090
Keep the nose down.

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,769
Don't climb too fast.

57
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,230
Keep your eye on that airspeed dial.

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,230
Climb at 80.

59
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,560
80s the perfect climb.'

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,659
Francesca wanted to look around.

61
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,170
Already the airfield was beginning to slip
away below, and new fields were coming into

62
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,140
view, but Francesca had to keep her eye on
the airspeed dial.

63
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,840
The needle was dropping.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
70... 65...

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
'Nose down!

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
Keep it down!'

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,890
Francesca pushed the control column forward
quickly.

68
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,209
The engine roared and the plane began bouncing
up and down.

69
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,849
She pulled back, trying to correct the movement,
but then the wings began rolling.

70
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,659
She felt a bit desperate; everything was going
wrong.

71
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,699
'OK,' said Doug, 'I have control.'

72
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:27,120
He reached out to the control column in front
of him and the plane began flying steadily.

73
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,300
Francesca felt her face burn red with shame.

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,870
'I'm sorry,' she said.

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,130
'I didn't mean...'

76
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,930
She couldn't even finish.

77
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,880
'Don't worry about it,' Doug answered.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,789
'Everyone finds it difficult at first.'

79
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,960
She glanced across at the man.

80
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,810
He was smiling at her.

81
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,069
'Just relax,' he said.

82
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:58,600
'I'll take us up a bit higher, then we can
level out and you can try again.'

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,509
Francesca watched as the instructor settled
the plane into a proper climb, then looked

84
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:06,229
out through the side window.

85
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,410
A sick feeling was rising up inside her.

86
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,160
Was flying really going to be so much harder
than she'd imagined?

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,510
She'd been looking forward to this moment
for so long, dreamed of piloting a plane for

88
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,819
so many years - surely it wasn't going to
be a disappointment after all?

89
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,810
'You OK?'

90
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,810
Doug called.

91
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,430
Francesca didn't look round.

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,630
She was determined not to let the man see
her nerves.

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,490
'Yes, fine,' she answered.

94
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,639
She looked down.

95
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,360
She saw a farm pass beneath them; the buildings
getting smaller even as she looked.

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,229
Then there was a road.

97
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,389
Already the cars on it looked like toys that
she might reach out and pick up in her hand.

98
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:01,190
Next a wood slid below, and the silvery S-shape
of a river, then the sharp brown line of a

99
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,190
railway.

100
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,150
At last, when Francesca felt in control of
herself again, she began looking round the

101
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,790
cockpit.

102
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,260
She stared at all the dials and switches in
front of her.

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,889
Would they ever make sense to her?

104
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,830
She must have shaken her head slightly.

105
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,229
'Confusing?'

106
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,760
the instructor's voice came.

107
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,180
She could see him smiling again.

108
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,110
'Yes,' she answered.

109
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,830
'Yes, they are.'

110
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,590
'You'll get used to them.

111
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:37,520
Just remember where the airspeed dial is - that's
the most important.

112
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
Speed through the air.

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,460
That's what keeps you flying.'

114
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,210
Francesca nodded and looked for the airspeed
dial again.

115
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,330
There it was in the top left-hand corner,
the needle pointing directly to 80.

116
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,409
The instructor made another quick call to
the control tower, so sudden and rapid that

117
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,389
Francesca didn't catch it.

118
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,150
Then he glanced across at her once more.

119
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,259
'So, how long have you been in England?' he
asked.

120
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,660
'Six months,' Francesca answered.

121
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,620
The man nodded.

122
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,010
'They did a good job at the language centre,'
he said.

123
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,550
'Your English is very impressive.'

124
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,830
'Thank you,' Francesca answered.

125
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,490
'I did ten years of English at school, so
it wasn't starting from zero.'

126
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,919
'And you didn't fancy university?'

127
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,819
the instructor asked.

128
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,169
'Came straight here to England when you left
school?'

129
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,139
'Yes,' Francesca replied.

130
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:48,780
'My parents tried to make me do a degree,
but all I've ever wanted is to learn to fly

131
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,830
and become a commercial pilot.

132
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,810
In the end, my father said, "Well, if I don't
have to pay for university, I suppose I can

133
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,439
pay for a language school and some flying
lessons."

134
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:11,600
And as English is the language of aviation,
England's the best place to learn to fly.'

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,849
Doug replied with a nod.

136
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,229
'So, what will you do after this?

137
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:23,580
You realise the commercial pilot's course
is ten times the cost of the private pilot's

138
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,060
licence you're doing with me?'

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,009
'Yes, I know,' Francesca answered.

140
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,060
'But I'm working as an au pair for the family
I live with here.

141
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,320
And then when I go back to Switzerland I'll
get a job and give extra English classes in

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,849
the evening.

143
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,130
I'm hoping I can make plenty of money like
that.'

144
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,060
Francesca saw Doug glance across at her.

145
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,600
For a moment a smile played around his lips
again as if an idea had occurred to him, but

146
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,329
then he said very simply, 'You are a very
determined young lady, Francesca.'

147
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:10,589
Francesca looked back into the man's dark
sunglasses, but couldn't see his eyes.

148
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,709
'I am,' she said quietly.

149
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:17,240
'Yes, I am.'

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,790
Doug turned his attention back to the controls.

151
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,300
Francesca watched him push the control column
forward very slowly.

152
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:32,470
As the nose of the plane dropped, suddenly
the horizon came into view through the windscreen.

153
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,740
Francesca felt their speed increasing rapidly,
and when she looked at the airspeed dial,

154
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,050
she saw it was already pointing to 120.

155
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,970
A few moments later, Doug reached for the
throttle and the speed dropped back a little.

156
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,920
'Right,' he said.

157
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,600
'We're flying straight and level now.

158
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,220
You take control again and see if you can
keep the plane steady like this.'

159
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,709
Very firmly, Francesca took hold of the controls
once more.

160
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,730
For two or three seconds as she took over,
the plane started bouncing around again.

161
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,730
'Gently!'

162
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,930
Doug called.

163
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,000
'You don't need to hold the controls so tightly.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,470
Imagine you're with your boyfriend,' he added
with a little laugh.

165
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,810
Francesca gave a small frown, but concentrated
on the control column.

166
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,940
She relaxed her grip slightly.

167
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,190
The plane seemed to respond.

168
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,279
Slowly, she moved the control column around
with tiny actions.

169
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,390
It was strange.

170
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:44,470
The plane seemed to fly itself somehow, as
if it were an animal, a horse perhaps, which

171
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,300
was just beginning to trust its rider.

172
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,250
'That's better!'

173
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,250
Doug called.

174
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,610
'That's the idea.'

175
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,029
Francesca felt her confidence returning.

176
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:02,360
Gradually, she increased the movements she
made, watching and feeling how the plane responded.

177
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,089
Slowly, a strange feeling came over her.

178
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:12,510
She felt as though she wasn't sitting in the
cockpit holding the control column, but instead

179
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,710
had her arms stretched out, like a child pretending
to have wings.

180
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,310
And as she imagined this - seeing herself
as the pilot of her dreams - the wings of

181
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,210
the plane seemed to melt into her own.

182
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,180
It felt like a miracle.

183
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,550
She was flying all alone.

184
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,149
All of a sudden she glanced across the cockpit.

185
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,730
Doug was staring at her, and nodding his head
very slowly.

186
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,530
'Very good,' he said.

187
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:52,399
'I'm full of admiration.'

188
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,760
CHAPTER TWO

189
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,720
The price of dreams

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:04,000
Two hours later, Francesca was on the bus
home, heading back to Norwich.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,360
As the bus found its way slowly through the
streets, Francesca looked out of the window

192
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,280
at the dull buildings and relived her first
flight.

193
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,530
It was hard to believe that she'd really been
piloting a plane up in the sky only a short

194
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,790
time before.

195
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,240
It felt almost like a dream.

196
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,350
But she had, and the lesson had gone well.

197
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,110
No, that wasn't true, she told herself - the
lesson had gone brilliantly, and she hadn't

198
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,320
just made that up herself.

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,899
The instructor had said so.

200
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,180
He had told her she was a 'natural'.

201
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,769
Francesca felt wonderfully happy.

202
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,450
She thought back over the day and her arrival
at the airfield.

203
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,790
She'd imagined Fastwings to be a busy little
flying school with several other students,

204
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:02,910
but when she'd arrived and discovered hers
was the only lesson that day, it had made

205
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,680
her feel uncomfortable.

206
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,269
So had Doug's welcome when she'd walked through
the Fastwings office door.

207
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,529
'Well, this is a pleasant surprise,' he'd
said.

208
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:20,149
'These lessons might be rather more fun than
I'd imagined.'

209
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,390
Francesca tried to decide what she thought
of Doug.

210
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,660
She felt confused.

211
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,839
He was about thirty-five or forty, quite tall
and good-looking.

212
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,820
However, that first remark of his was just
the sort of thing she'd hoped she wouldn't

213
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,830
hear in England.

214
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,320
And there was something in his eyes she didn't
like.

215
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,399
But then that had passed, and she had the
flying lesson to concentrate on.

216
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,579
There was no doubt he was a very good pilot
and he'd made her feel good about her flying.

217
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:59,510
It was just the way he looked at her and his
odd remarks that made her feel uncomfortable.

218
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,420
She was used to such comments from Italian
men, who were always trying to show off in

219
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,860
front of women.

220
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,259
But Doug was English and she thought Englishmen
might be different.

221
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,480
What had he said about handling the control
column like her boyfriend?

222
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,940
Did it mean what she thought?

223
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,980
Francesca felt her heart drop all of a sudden
as the image of Andrea came crashing back

224
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,440
into her head.

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,700
Dear Andrea.

226
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,639
The break-up of their relationship was almost
too painful a memory: the last three months

227
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,370
in Ticino, before she came over to England,
had been so emotional.

228
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,120
Andrea had been her first - well, her only
real boyfriend.

229
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,980
They'd begun going out together when Francesca
was only fifteen.

230
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,680
And she'd loved him deeply.

231
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,050
Dear Andrea, funny, handsome, sexy Andrea
- the boy she'd given herself to - the boy

232
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,740
she'd imagined marrying and having children
with.

233
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,589
But Andrea hadn't wanted her to come to Britain.

234
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,720
He hadn't wanted Francesca to learn to fly.

235
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,899
He'd always said her plan to become an airline
pilot was ridiculous, an embarrassment to

236
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,490
him, something he couldn't possibly ever accept.

237
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,750
And he'd meant it.

238
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,560
Whenever Francesca had raised the subject,
he'd become angry, once even marching out

239
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,680
of a cafe in front of all her friends with
a cry of 'Stupid, selfish dreamer!'

240
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,230
Well, who was the selfish one?

241
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,810
What kind of love was it that wanted to cut
your wings?

242
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,050
And what was wrong with having a dream?

243
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:53,040
In the end, Francesca had decided their relationship
would never work.

244
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,610
But making that decision, and finishing things
with Andrea, had almost broken her heart.

245
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,830
She'd made up her mind then that nothing,
and no one, would ever stand in the way of

246
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,709
her flying dream.

247
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:14,230
She wasn't interested in a relationship with
anyone.

248
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,360
The sight of a familiar pub brought Francesca
back to the present.

249
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,410
The next bus stop was hers.

250
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,960
She hurried off the bus and turned in the
direction of home.

251
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,870
She had a job as an au pair with the Thompson
family, looking after the two children, Sam

252
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,420
and Emma.

253
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,600
That afternoon Mrs Thompson was picking the
children up from school, so Francesca only

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,589
had to prepare their dinner, and get them
ready for bed.

255
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:50,579
After that, she was free - well, free only
to continue studying all the instruction books

256
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:58,509
necessary for the pilot's licence exams: aviation
law, radio procedures, the weather, all the

257
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,180
technical matters...

258
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,720
the amount was terrifying.

259
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
A pretty scarf in a shop window caught her
eye.

260
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
She hesitated.

261
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,680
To her surprise, it wasn't very expensive:
only 11.99 pounds.

262
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,470
Not very much to spend, she said to herself.

263
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,850
A moment later she dragged herself away from
the shop window.

264
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,040
She couldn't afford it.

265
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,020
If she wanted to achieve her ambition, there
could be no luxuries.

266
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,140
She had to save and save and save!

267
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,300
Everything now was a question of money.

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,530
Flying was so hugely expensive!

269
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:47,430
Lessons were more than 140 pounds an hour
and the minimum required for the private pilot's

270
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,930
licence was forty-five hours.

271
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:57,480
She'd arranged with Doug to have two one-hour
lessons a week over the following six months,

272
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,440
on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons - the days
Mrs Thompson only worked in the mornings.

273
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,970
But, in order to get a discount, she'd paid
Doug in advance for the whole course, including

274
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,290
examinations, and equipment - and the total
was over 7000 pounds!

275
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:22,650
And if she needed more than forty- five hours
for the private pilot's licence, she would

276
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,080
have to pay extra.

277
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,550
Even though her father had agreed to pay 5000
pounds now and then help fund the commercial

278
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,220
pilot training, the amounts required were
frightening.

279
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:41,810
As an au pair, although her room and food
were paid for, she only received 50 pounds

280
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,980
a week - less than half-an-hour's flying lesson.

281
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,510
Mrs Thompson was waiting for her when she
got home.

282
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,780
'So, how was it?'

283
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,790
she asked.

284
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,030
Francesca couldn't help grinning.

285
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,220
'Fantastic!'

286
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,220
she said.

287
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,040
'I'm so excited.

288
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,970
The instructor said I was very good.'

289
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,710
'Wonderful,' Mrs Thompson replied.

290
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,050
'But now you need to call your mother.

291
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:17,920
She telephoned ten minutes ago, terrified
that you might have had an accident.'

292
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,320
Francesca shook her head in despair.

293
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,870
Her mother's fears were yet another stress
she had to handle.

294
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,310
Francesca went upstairs, opened up her laptop
to make a Skype call, then listened to the

295
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,710
familiar sound as the number rang in Ticino.

296
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,000
After only a couple of seconds, her mother's
anxious face appeared on the screen.

297
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,930
A rush of Italian followed.

298
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,930
'Francesca!

299
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,990
Francesca, my darling, is that you?

300
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,780
Are you all right?

301
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,790
Why didn't you phone?

302
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:56,580
Your father and I have been worried sick!'
said her mother.

303
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,080
'Mamma!'

304
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,420
Francesca said, when she finally managed to
get in a word.

305
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,850
'Calm down!

306
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,860
I've only just got home.

307
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,430
Everything's fine.'

308
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,340
'Oh, thank God for that!'

309
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
her mother replied.

310
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:19,300
'I haven't been able to do anything all day,
imagining you crashing the stupid plane.

311
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,210
Please say you didn't enjoy it and that you've
decided to come home.'

312
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,670
Francesca closed her eyes.

313
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,980
After a couple of seconds she took a deep
breath.

314
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,250
'No, Mamma,' she said.

315
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,100
'It was brilliant.

316
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,770
Mamma, you must try not to worry.

317
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,160
The instructor called me "a natural".

318
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,960
It was even better than I'd dreamed!'

319
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
CHAPTER THREE

320
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,640
A different kind of fun

321
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:04,600
'Right,' Doug said, looking across the cockpit
at Francesca, 'I think it's about time we

322
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,140
had a bit of fun.'

323
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,210
'What do you mean?'

324
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,450
Francesca answered.

325
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,610
'Well, there are all kinds of fun,' Doug replied
with a strange smile.

326
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,630
'But the fun I'm referring to is stalling.'

327
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,120
Francesca felt confused.

328
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,440
'I'm sorry, I don't understand,' she said.

329
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,940
She wasn't certain whether he was making a
joke, but in any case the word 'stalling'

330
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,950
was a new one for her.

331
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,920
'A stall,' Doug replied, becoming more serious,
'is when the plane stops flying - usually

332
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,100
when it isn't going fast enough for the wings
to do their job.

333
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,530
In other words, when a plane is in danger
of falling out of the sky!'

334
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,670
It was a fortnight later - two weeks after
Francesca's first lesson.

335
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,610
She'd had three more lessons since and things
couldn't be going better.

336
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,580
In the second lesson she'd had further practice
at flying straight and level.

337
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,610
Then she'd gone on to 'turns': 'banking' the
plane - rolling the plane to the left and

338
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,860
right; and also 'the climb', which had seemed
so difficult in her first lesson.

339
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,840
Doug kept telling her how pleased he was with
her.

340
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,630
He had even said if she continued at the same
rate of progress, he could imagine her taking

341
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,420
her first solo flight in a couple of weeks'
time - after perhaps only ten hours - much

342
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,060
faster than the average student.

343
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,520
But now Francesca felt a tiny stab of fear.

344
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,050
Doug still had this slightly cruel look on
his face.

345
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,460
She was beginning to think he quite enjoyed
it when she was frightened.

346
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,310
Francesca tried to focus on the lesson again.

347
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,500
'So, what are we going to do then?'

348
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,920
she asked as lightly as she could.

349
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,500
'Well,' Doug replied, 'we're going to fly
the plane up to 4000 feet, check there's no

350
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:19,720
one else about, and then you're going to cut
the power until the plane stops flying.'

351
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,060
Doug paused, the sunglasses he always wore
flashing in the sunlight.

352
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,510
'What happens then?'

353
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,210
Francesca asked, trying to disguise the slight
tremble in her voice.

354
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,770
'Well, then, I hope you're going to get the
plane flying again.'

355
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,540
Doug paused and smiled.

356
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:47,200
'Otherwise we'll make a horrible mess in a
field!'

357
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,340
Fifteen minutes later, they took off and began
climbing into the grey sky.

358
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,100
It was a dull day, not the bright clear weather
that Francesca had experienced for her other

359
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,660
lessons.

360
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,440
When they reached 4000 feet Francesca set
the plane up for straight and level flight,

361
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,810
but it was much more difficult than in her
last lessons.

362
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:17,670
The grey of the land and the grey of the sky
meant there was almost no horizon - no guide

363
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,890
for keeping level.

364
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,140
She started to feel nervous.

365
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,500
They flew on for five minutes until they were
out over farmland to the west of the city.

366
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,400
Then, after glancing around out of the cockpit
window, Doug spoke again.

367
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,140
'Right,' he said.

368
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,180
'First, check your safety harness.'

369
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,660
Francesca pulled against the harness, but
she was held so tight against the seat she

370
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,590
could barely move.

371
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,890
'Good,' Doug went on, once he'd checked his
own harness.

372
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,960
'Right, now we look around: to the right...
and the left...

373
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,930
now a quick look behind... and most important
of all, down below...

374
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,510
Anything about?'

375
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,180
Francesca searched the sky, but couldn't see
any other aircraft.

376
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,880
'No,' she answered.

377
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,780
'OK, now listen carefully,' Doug continued.

378
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,920
'In a moment you're going to pull out the
throttle so there's no power, and pull back

379
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,080
on the control column to keep the nose up
in the air.

380
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,160
At some point you'll feel the plane tremble
and the controls will go soft like jelly.

381
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,460
And the stall-warning alarm behind us will
sound - it's like a trumpet sound.

382
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,630
Then, all of a sudden the nose will drop.

383
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,930
When that happens, push the control column
forward - this is very important.

384
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:51,340
Don't pull it back, which seems the natural
thing to do - push forward so that you're

385
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,900
heading towards the ground.

386
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,010
If you don't do that, the plane won't start
flying again.

387
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,510
After a few seconds like that, the plane will
pick up flying speed and you can pull out

388
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,610
of the dive and add the power again.'

389
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,600
He looked across at Francesca.

390
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,680
'OK, do you understand?'

391
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,180
Francesca repeated the instructions back.

392
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,930
Her heart was beating a little faster, unsure
of exactly what lay ahead.

393
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,550
'Ready?'

394
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,450
Doug asked.

395
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,660
Francesca nodded.

396
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,600
'Right,' he said.

397
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,450
'Now, pull out the throttle.'

398
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,910
Francesca obeyed.

399
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,600
Almost immediately the power died away and
the nose began to drop.

400
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,000
'Pull back!' Doug called.

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,570
Francesca did as he said.

402
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,950
The control column was firm, much firmer than
she'd felt before.

403
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,140
'Harder!'

404
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Doug shouted.

405
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,150
'Pull back!

406
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,260
Keep the nose up!'

407
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,550
It required all Francesca's strength to keep
pulling back.

408
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,170
She felt herself becoming more and more anxious.

409
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,600
It was partly because of the way the plane
was behaving, but partly Doug's shouting as

410
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
well.

411
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,060
Her heart was racing.

412
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,110
'Keep pulling back!' he called.

413
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,110
'Harder!

414
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,130
Come on!'

415
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:20,390
Suddenly the stall-warning alarm sounded - a
long steady noise that didn't stop.

416
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,430
For a moment the plane trembled, then all
at once, the wings seemed to fold.

417
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,260
For the next couple of seconds Francesca didn't
know what was happening.

418
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,180
Her stomach seemed to fall out of her body.

419
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,430
Suddenly she found she was staring at the
ground and the earth was racing up to meet

420
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,430
them.

421
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,290
A scream became trapped in her throat; she
was paralysed with fear.

422
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:52,910
The thought rushed through her head that she
was going to die, that this was it, that the

423
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,770
flying idea had been a terrible mistake.

424
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,840
She didn't know what to do.

425
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,910
The next moment she realised Doug had taken
over the controls.

426
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:08,650
Still with the scream caught in her throat,
she saw him take his control column firmly

427
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:15,080
in both hands and push forward, increasing
the angle of their dive, then slowly pull

428
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,170
back.

429
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:22,360
After a few seconds he had brought back the
power and they were flying straight and level

430
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,480
again.

431
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,410
For a short while Francesca felt nothing but
relief.

432
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,410
Then she felt her face burning with shame.

433
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,290
Doug was watching her closely.

434
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,270
'You OK?'

435
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,890
'F... fine,' Francesca stammered.

436
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,250
She felt angry all of a sudden.

437
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:49,600
'I... it just took me by surprise, that's
all,' she said.

438
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,920
Doug smiled.

439
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,610
'Yes,' he replied quietly.

440
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,780
'It's a bit of a shock the first time.

441
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,860
Just a matter of letting yourself go,' he
added lightly.

442
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,660
'Like some other kind of fun I can think of.

443
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,520
In time you might actually get to like it.'

444
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:16,520
As he said so, he looked across again and
rested a hand on Francesca's knee.

445
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,420
For a moment she didn't realise what had happened.

446
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,510
Then she threw him a look of astonishment.

447
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,080
A couple of seconds later he withdrew his
hand.

448
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:38,790
They flew on in silence and neither referred
to what had happened.

449
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,790
CHAPTER FOUR

450
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,000
Have no fear!

451
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,220
That night Francesca couldn't sleep, her mind
was so full of unpleasant thoughts.

452
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,820
The incident that afternoon had reminded her
of the manager of a cafe where she'd worked

453
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,280
for the summer a couple of years before.

454
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,741
With a feeling of sickness, she remembered
the horrible man purposely pushing past her

455
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:10,080
as she worked behind the counter, pressing
himself against her and pretending it was

456
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,410
an accident.

457
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:18,500
Although it had happened four or five times,
she'd done nothing and said nothing, instead

458
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,200
deciding the best thing was simply to change
jobs.

459
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,810
But the incident had both embarrassed and
angered her.

460
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:34,580
Now the memory of Doug's words and his hand
on her knee gave her the same miserable feeling.

461
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,650
Had she misunderstood what he was saying?

462
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,620
Had his hand simply been a friendly gesture
to reassure her?

463
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,800
Or was it something else?

464
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,480
Was he trying to suggest something to her?

465
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,030
After half an hour like this, she finally
sat up, switched on the bedside light, and

466
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,470
decided to think logically about what had
happened.

467
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:06,010
Taking her iPod from the drawer, she put on
the headphones, selected some gentle music,

468
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,390
and slowly felt herself calm down.

469
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,640
Then she thought back to that afternoon's
incident.

470
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,150
Had it really happened?

471
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,590
Yes, of course, it had.

472
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,280
Was it an accident?

473
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,160
No, of course, it wasn't.

474
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,800
But that didn't necessarily mean Doug had
a sexual motive.

475
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,650
Stalling the aircraft had seriously alarmed
her and he might have been genuinely trying

476
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,240
to reassure her.

477
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,710
But was it acceptable for a man to put his
hand on her knee like that?

478
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:46,370
She wished desperately there was another woman
taking lessons for her to talk to, but there

479
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,370
wasn't.

480
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:53,300
There seemed to be only two other students,
in fact - both men, and she had yet to see

481
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,770
either of them.

482
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:02,170
When Francesca had asked where the other students
were, Doug had simply said, 'Well, times are

483
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,020
hard, didn't you know?'

484
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
And then, 'Why?

485
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,420
What's the problem?'

486
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,130
Francesca tried to think what she knew about
Doug already.

487
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,540
She was sure he was married.

488
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,490
Once when she was waiting in the office, Doug
had taken a phone call, discussing the time

489
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,410
he'd be home that evening.

490
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:27,220
Francesca remembered that as he'd put down
the phone he'd made one of those typically

491
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:34,230
British comments she couldn't be certain was
a joke - something about 'the joys of marriage'.

492
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,370
She guessed, too, that he had children: a
picture frame on his desk contained a photo

493
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,780
of two pretty young girls - twins of six or
seven, she thought.

494
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:49,140
But did it make any difference whether he
was married with children?

495
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,300
Her experience at the cafe had taught her
that it didn't.

496
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,830
That dirty old man had a wife and three horrible
teenage boys, who used to sit around the cafe,

497
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,750
grinning at her in almost as disgusting a
manner as the old man's.

498
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,110
For a moment or two she considered searching
for Doug Barker on the Internet and seeing

499
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,020
what she could discover about him, then decided
it was ridiculous.

500
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,520
She switched off her iPod, turned out the
light and determined to get some rest.

501
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,890
It was half an hour more before sleep finally
came.

502
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,890
***

503
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:35,750
By the time of her next lesson, two days later,
the whole 'hand-on-the-knee' business seemed

504
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,440
like a crazy dream and her spirits lifted
again.

505
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,610
Flying was the important thing.

506
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,310
She had to concentrate on that.

507
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,660
She was a little late when she arrived at
the airfield that afternoon.

508
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,640
Doug was in the hangar where the planes were
kept, checking the Cessnas engine.

509
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,980
'So, you've come after all,' he said, without
looking round.

510
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,730
'I was afraid the last lesson might have frightened
you off.'

511
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:11,840
Francesca hesitated for a moment, wondering
exactly what he meant, then she answered,

512
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,850
'Not at all.

513
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,319
My bus was held up in the traffic, that's
all.'

514
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,730
Doug turned to look at her and smiled.

515
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,280
'Good,' he said.

516
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,330
'It would be a terrible shame after such a
promising beginning.'

517
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,790
To Francesca's relief, Doug seemed to be in
a very business-like mood that day.

518
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,280
They dragged the plane outside and began by
checking round the aircraft.

519
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,830
Although she'd helped with the checks in her
previous lessons, Doug hadn't spent very long

520
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,669
explaining all the procedures.

521
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:49,100
This time he did.

522
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,599
Francesca was impressed at how careful it
all was: walking round the plane, examining

523
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,900
all the moving parts, looking at the tyres,
pushing and pulling at everything that could

524
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,160
be pushed or pulled, checking the lights and
oil.

525
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,640
Then Doug got out a small glass bottle shaped
like a test tube and pressed it up into a

526
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,720
small hole under the wing.

527
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,560
It half filled with fuel.

528
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,230
'Smell!' he said, holding the test tube out
to Francesca.

529
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,230
Francesca frowned.

530
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,230
'Why?'

531
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,480
she asked.

532
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,660
'Because if it doesn't smell like fuel, then
it may be water,' he explained.

533
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,340
'The fuel tanks are in the wings and if the
aircraft has been standing outside for a time,

534
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,900
rain might get in.

535
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,970
We do this before the first flight of the
day.

536
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,970
Look at the test tube.

537
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,960
What can you see?'

538
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,260
'Nothing special,' Francesca answered, 'just
clear liquid.'

539
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,520
'Then that's fine,' Doug went on.

540
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,160
'If there was water mixed in, the water would
sink to the bottom and you might see a line

541
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,190
dividing it from the fuel above.'

542
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,980
The checks went on for more than twenty minutes,
then Doug turned to her.

543
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,340
'Right,' he said, 'in future you'll do all
the checks on your own.

544
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:20,710
As the pilot of the plane it's your responsibility
to make sure it's safe to fly.

545
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,160
Understand?'

546
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,350
Francesca nodded.

547
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,900
'OK,' he said, 'let's go flying.'

548
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,840
Soon they were high up above the ground, heading
in the direction of the coast.

549
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,460
The sky was especially beautiful that day:
a clear blue, but dotted with clean white

550
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,860
clouds like exploding balls of paint.

551
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,770
Francesca began to relax.

552
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,020
Up in the sky her fears about Doug seemed
quite ridiculous.

553
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,910
Clearly, she had got everything out of proportion.

554
00:36:53,910 --> 00:37:01,690
This time they practised descending: losing
height steadily using the power of the engine,

555
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:07,240
holding the plane at the same angle and trying
to keep the same speed.

556
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,930
For the first few minutes, Francesca struggled,
then, with her confidence returning, she began

557
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,550
to learn the technique.

558
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:21,050
After three or four attempts, she realised
that a smile of success had returned to her

559
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,050
face.

560
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,410
Noticing this, Doug spoke.

561
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,930
'So, how about another go at stalling?'

562
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,250
he said.

563
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,960
Francesca felt herself tense up again immediately.

564
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,680
Would this be another opportunity for him
to touch her knee?

565
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,900
She was determined not to show her fears.

566
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,120
'Good,' she answered.

567
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,810
'I want to get that right.'

568
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,390
Doug gave a short laugh.

569
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:55,970
'OK, take us up to 4000 feet again and let's
see what happens.'

570
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,460
Feeling her heart start to race, Francesca
put the plane into a climb.

571
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,280
Once they'd reached height, they checked their
safety harnesses and Francesca looked carefully

572
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,260
all around outside the plane.

573
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:17,050
Then, at Doug's instruction, she killed the
power and prepared for the stall.

574
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,690
'Pull back... pull back... that's the idea.'

575
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,310
Doug's words were more familiar this time.

576
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,980
So, too, was the plane's behaviour.

577
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,340
After what seemed like an age, the plane began
trembling just as before, then it suddenly

578
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,220
collapsed forward.

579
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,670
This time Francesca was ready for it.

580
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:43,950
As the nose fell towards the ground, she pushed
the control column forward and slowly increased

581
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,990
the power.

582
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:51,080
The plane responded immediately, the wings
grabbing at the sky, as if it were a climber

583
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,830
pulling itself back up a mountain.

584
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,130
Francesca breathed a sigh of relief.

585
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,810
She hadn't panicked, she had overcome her
fears.

586
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,260
And Doug hadn't touched her.

587
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,780
Everything was all right.

588
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,280
Doug was looking at her.

589
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,820
'You're a quick learner, Francesca,' he said.

590
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:24,130
Then he added with a short laugh, 'Just a
pity you don't need calming down.'

591
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,340
CHAPTER FIVE

592
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
Getting to know you

593
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:35,540
Ninety minutes later, Francesca was hurrying
down the road to the airfield gates.

594
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,660
The lesson had finished late and now she was
in danger of missing her bus.

595
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
She broke into a run.

596
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,230
If she missed the bus, she wouldn't be back
in time to get the children's dinner.

597
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:53,750
But despite running the rest of the way, she
saw the bus disappearing round the bend just

598
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,080
as she reached the gates.

599
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,320
Miserably, she sank down onto the grass by
the entrance.

600
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,720
The next bus wasn't for another hour.

601
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,610
She could ring Mrs Thompson, but she didn't
want to let her down.

602
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:15,020
She was just on the point of calling a taxi
and facing up to all that expense when she

603
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,210
saw a grey Audi approaching.

604
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,610
The next moment it pulled up beside her.

605
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,430
It was Doug.

606
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,860
He lowered the window and leant across.

607
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,290
'Waiting for a pick-up?' he asked.

608
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,250
Francesca's heart missed a beat.

609
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,520
Suddenly, she wasn't sure of her English.

610
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Didn't 'pick-up' have a double meaning?

611
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,250
'I missed my bus,' she answered flatly.

612
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,370
'Jump in,' he went on.

613
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,370
'I'll give you a lift.'

614
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,280
The passenger door opened.

615
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,780
Francesca stood there looking at it stupidly.

616
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,640
Half a dozen conflicting thoughts were rushing
round her head, some saying: 'Don't get in,

617
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,280
don't be crazy,' while others were saying:
'Don't be ridiculous, you've just been alone

618
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,340
in a plane with him!

619
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,910
What's the difference?'

620
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,440
'What's the problem?'

621
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,690
Doug asked.

622
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:18,340
Taking a deep breath, Francesca stepped forward,
climbed inside the car and pulled the door

623
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
closed.

624
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,580
All of sudden she felt trapped.

625
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,900
The car pulled away.

626
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,070
Soon they were driving towards the city centre.

627
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,760
Francesca tried to calm herself.

628
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,170
After a short time, Doug glanced across.

629
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,010
'So, tell me more about yourself,' he said.

630
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,860
'I think we ought to know a little about each
other, don't you - especially if we're spending

631
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,510
all this time alone together.'

632
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,200
Francesca felt her whole body tense up.

633
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,400
'You know most things about me already,' she
murmured.

634
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,450
'No, I don't,' Doug answered.

635
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,670
'I'm interested.

636
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:07,120
A beautiful girl like you, giving up everything
in Switzerland and coming over here to learn

637
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,890
to fly.

638
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,330
Most girls your age are probably chatting
on Facebook and discussing boyfriends.'

639
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,960
'I'm not fifteen years old,' Francesca replied
sharply.

640
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,970
'Oh, I can see that,' Doug answered, looking
across.

641
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,050
'No, I simply meant you're pretty unusual.

642
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:35,460
Not many of my students come for their flying
lessons by bus, you know.'

643
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,560
Francesca kept her eyes firmly on the road
ahead.

644
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,170
'It must have meant a lot of sacrifices,'
Doug said.

645
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:49,250
Feeling she had to reply, Francesca answered,
'Not many.'

646
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:56,480
'Come on,' Doug continued, 'What about holidays,
clothes, all that sort of thing?

647
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,400
And no doubt you've left behind at least one
boy with an aching heart.'

648
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,930
Francesca felt sick.

649
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,790
She was urging the car on, willing it to get
to the city quickly.

650
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:14,220
'Why do you keep asking about boyfriends?'

651
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,410
she said, trying to keep control of her voice.

652
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,970
This seemed to amuse Doug even more.

653
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,680
'I just thought it might be quite lonely for
you here all on your own.'

654
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,960
He looked across at her and smiled.

655
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,230
Francesca took a moment to reply.

656
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,370
'Look,' she said, unable to hide her temper.

657
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,650
'I don't think my private life is any of your
business.

658
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,660
But if you must know - yes, I'm on my own
and I'm very happy like that.

659
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,760
All I want to do is get my pilot's licence.

660
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,580
Just now I'm not interested in anything else.'

661
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,260
'An excellent philosophy,' Doug said.

662
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,300
He turned towards her, that familiar smile
playing around his lips again.

663
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,010
'Apologies for asking.'

664
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,620
Francesca didn't look back.

665
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,030
Her blood was still boiling.

666
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,040
After a couple of seconds, Doug looked away
again.

667
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,490
They drove on in silence for a couple of minutes.

668
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:25,380
Then, all of a sudden, Doug turned onto a
quieter road.

669
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,070
Francesca tensed up again.

670
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,020
It wasn't the route the bus took.

671
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,320
'Where are we going?'

672
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
she asked.

673
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,380
'I thought you lived in Eaton,' Doug said.

674
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,880
'This is a short cut.'

675
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
Francesca shivered.

676
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,810
A horrible scene began playing out in her
mind: Doug driving her to some secret place,

677
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,110
locking the car doors so she was trapped inside,
then forcing himself on her.

678
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,980
Her heart raced crazily.

679
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,210
Surely it would be madness for him to try
anything?

680
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,540
She took a deep breath.

681
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,170
Doug glanced round.

682
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,740
'Are you all right?' he asked.

683
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,400
'You look very pale.'

684
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,810
'I'm fine,' Francesca answered weakly.

685
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,970
Doug watched her for a second or two longer,
looking unconvinced.

686
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,850
He didn't say anything for a time.

687
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,380
They drove on.

688
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,070
After a couple of turns, Francesca suddenly
recognised a church on the left-hand side.

689
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,460
She breathed a sigh of relief.

690
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,770
Perhaps Doug had taken a short cut after all.

691
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,710
'What's the name of your road?'

692
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,780
Doug asked.

693
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,060
Francesca hesitated.

694
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,910
'If you just drop me here, I'll be fine,'
she said quickly.

695
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,510
'Don't be silly,' Doug answered.

696
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,680
'Considering how much you're paying me, taking
you back home for once is the least I can

697
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,480
do.'

698
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,470
Francesca couldn't see a way out.

699
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,620
'It's Brabazon Road,' she said quietly.

700
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,010
Doug nodded.

701
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,050
After several more turns, they swung into
Francesca's road.

702
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,700
'What number?'

703
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
Doug asked.

704
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,660
'Really, just here would be great,' Francesca
protested.

705
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:16,710
'I run a door-to-door service,' Doug answered
firmly.

706
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,480
Francesca swallowed hard.

707
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,160
'It's the big house on the left, just after
the second tree,' she said.

708
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,210
A couple of moments later they pulled up at
the entrance to her driveway.

709
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,070
Francesca felt relief flood through her.

710
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:38,420
'Thank you very much,' she said, feeling she
should try to be polite.

711
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,350
'My pleasure,' Doug said, smiling.

712
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,650
Francesca had her hand on the door.

713
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,390
The next moment Doug suddenly leant across
her.

714
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,720
Terrified, Francesca pressed herself back
into the seat.

715
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,480
What was happening?

716
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,230
Doug gave a short laugh.

717
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,700
'Take it easy!

718
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm only opening the door for you.'

719
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,170
He stretched right across her and reached
to the door.

720
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,700
'Handle's a bit awkward, you see.'

721
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,020
The door swung open.

722
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,300
Francesca climbed out.

723
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,850
'Thank you again,' she said very quietly.

724
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:28,290
Doug pulled the door shut and drove off without
replying.

725
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,760
CHAPTER SIX

726
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,440
If only...

727
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,560
That evening, once Sam and Emma, the Thompsons
children, had gone to bed and Francesca had

728
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,840
cleared up in the kitchen, she went back up
to her room to make her daily Skype call to

729
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,810
her parents.

730
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:51,810
As usual, she kept it cheerful and positive.

731
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:56,860
She told them happily of all the progress
she'd made and related a couple of Doug's

732
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,100
comments praising her flying skills.

733
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,760
She then concentrated on news about Sam and
Emma, which was what her mother was most interested

734
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,470
in.

735
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:13,560
With her family duty done, Francesca then
decided to email Antonella, her best friend

736
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,860
back home.

737
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:22,190
Although her message was definitely still
positive, she finished, 'The only problem

738
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:28,400
is that the instructor, Doug, makes me feel
really uncomfortable.

739
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,730
Although he's a good pilot, he makes these
weird remarks and I keep thinking he's about

740
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,090
to make some sort of sexual move.

741
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,810
He definitely touched my knee!

742
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,890
He seems to be laughing at me half the time
and he really scares me.

743
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,210
I just don't like him.'

744
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,920
Once she'd finished her email, Francesca read
it through.

745
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,130
She stared for a long time at the lines she'd
written about Doug.

746
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:05,050
Finally, with a little cry of annoyance, she
deleted everything she'd said about him, and

747
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,770
pressed 'Send' before she could change her
mind.

748
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,480
She was about to shut down the laptop, when
she found herself opening up the Internet

749
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,240
again and typing in the address of the Fastwings
website.

750
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:29,200
The familiar front page opened up: the picture
of her Cessna, G-AZBA, Doug in flying jacket

751
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,490
and sunglasses, leaning up against the engine.

752
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:40,800
A couple of bubbles of text near the bottom
caught her eye - recommendations from previous

753
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,760
students: 'Superb instruction from beginning
to end.

754
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,880
I never expected it to be so much fun!'

755
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,150
And another: 'As a one-man show, Fastwings
can keep costs to a minimum.

756
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,820
Getting my licence was cheaper than I imagined!'

757
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,000
Francesca thought about the comments.

758
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,860
It was that second one, emphasising how cheap
it was, which had made her pick Fastwings.

759
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,300
She wished now she'd chosen another flying
school.

760
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,740
She'd considered others at the time - there
was even another one at Norwich.

761
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,170
She typed that in now: Flying Start.

762
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,230
A fresh page appeared.

763
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:29,869
She remembered it immediately: the rather
unappealing picture of a young student sitting

764
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:32,680
in the cockpit beside his instructor.

765
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:39,010
The instructor looked very formal in his white
shirt and tie - another reason why Francesca

766
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,020
had chosen Fastwings.

767
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,610
Doug had seemed so much more casual.

768
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,860
Francesca tried to see into the Flying Start
instructor's eyes.

769
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:56,050
He looked very correct, certainly not someone
who might try to take advantage of her.

770
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,860
An idea flashed through her mind.

771
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:05,830
Could she switch schools, ask for her money
back from Fastwings, then sign up at Flying

772
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,830
Start?

773
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:11,460
She wouldn't have to begin all over again,
she would be able to continue from the point

774
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,550
she'd already reached.

775
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,340
But almost as quickly as the idea had come,
it died.

776
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,330
How could she ask Doug for her money back?

777
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,680
What could she give as a reason?

778
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,690
Francesca closed down her computer quickly,
angry with herself now.

779
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,960
What was she thinking?

780
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,640
Doug hadn't done anything.

781
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,310
Well, he'd possibly touched her on the knee,
but nothing more.

782
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,310
Nothing had happened!

783
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,790
She'd let her imagination run wild in the
car with him.

784
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:49,000
What was wrong with her?

785
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,620
Perhaps living here in England all on her
own was too much for her.

786
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,340
Perhaps she was too young.

787
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,910
Feeling furious with herself, Francesca marched
through into the bathroom, tore off her clothes

788
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,290
and stood under the shower.

789
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:10,600
Finally, after a couple of minutes under the
steady stream of water, she began to calm

790
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,890
down.

791
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:14,890
***

792
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,680
Francesca was determined to focus on her flying
when she arrived at the airfield for her next

793
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,490
lesson.

794
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:27,280
She knocked on the office door and was surprised
when a woman's voice told her to come in.

795
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,369
When she entered, she found a dark-haired
woman of about forty, sitting on the sofa.

796
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:35,470
She looked tired and fed up.

797
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:40,920
Two little girls were kneeling at her feet,
drawing in colouring books on the low table

798
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,280
in front of her.

799
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,880
Francesca recognised them from the photo on
Doug's desk.

800
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,790
'You must be Francesca,' the woman said immediately.

801
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,860
Francesca realised it was Doug's wife.

802
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,520
'Mrs Barker?'

803
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,540
she said.

804
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,430
'That's right,' the woman replied.

805
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,450
'I've heard all about you.

806
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,820
Doug's star pupil!'

807
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,710
She didn't wait for a response, but began
gathering her things together.

808
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,430
'Don't worry, we're not staying.

809
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,810
We just came to bring Doug his phone.

810
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,130
He left it on the dining table.

811
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,970
He's always forgetting things, poor man.'

812
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,230
Francesca didn't know how to react.

813
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,590
The woman sounded bitter and sarcastic.

814
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:35,820
Sometimes the English way of saying the opposite
of what was meant left her completely confused.

815
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:42,110
But she didn't need to think of an answer
because the next moment Doug came in.

816
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:47,130
'Don't bother with the introductions,' Mrs
Barker said, 'we've already done all that.

817
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,410
Besides, we're going.

818
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,790
How much did you manage to get?'

819
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:58,660
A brief discussion followed which Francesca
understood was something to do with money.

820
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:04,690
Doug then took out his wallet and handed across
a couple of notes, which his wife immediately

821
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,170
put in her bag.

822
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,370
All of a sudden, Doug marched across the room.

823
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:17,600
'I told you not to do that!' he shouted, pulling
up one of the girls roughly by the arm.

824
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,060
'I told you not to get your pens all over
the floor!'

825
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,030
The girl's face immediately twisted in fear
and alarm.

826
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,180
The next moment she began to cry.

827
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,400
She ran over to her mother's side.

828
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,890
'Oh, brilliant work, Doug!'

829
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,050
his wife said sharply.

830
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,490
'Well, it serves her right.

831
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,450
She should bloody well listen when I give
her orders,' Doug said angrily.

832
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:46,500
A short argument followed.

833
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:52,310
Eventually, Doug's wife gathered the children
together and they made for the door.

834
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:58,109
Doug meanwhile sank down into a chair and
watched the scene moodily.

835
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:05,580
A moment or two later, with barely a word
of goodbye, the small group hurried away.

836
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,380
When they'd gone, Doug twisted his face into
a frown.

837
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:15,160
'See what I mean about the joys of marriage?'
he said.

838
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,590
Francesca didn't respond.

839
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,330
At last Doug pulled himself upright.

840
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:24,220
'OK, "landings" today, wasn't it?

841
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:35,220
Perhaps you could do me a favour and fly us
straight into the ground.'

842
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,220
CHAPTER SEVEN

843
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:41,230
An unhappy client

844
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,700
For the next half hour, Francesca listened
while Doug explained in detail the principles

845
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,180
of landing.

846
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:54,560
It seemed the general idea was to bring the
plane slowly down, by carefully controlling

847
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,400
the power.

848
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,190
The most difficult part was the final moments.

849
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:06,770
When the plane was six or seven metres above
the ground, you had to 'flare' - to pull back

850
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:12,530
gently on the control column so that the main
wheels touched the ground before the nose

851
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:13,530
wheel.

852
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:19,190
At that point you had to hold steady, letting
the speed die away, so that the plane would

853
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,880
gently sink down.

854
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,410
'It's not as easy as it sounds,' Doug added.

855
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:30,370
'Some students get it almost immediately;
some take a long time.

856
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:35,640
Judging when to flare - when to pull back
- is the biggest problem.

857
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,490
You have to wait until the ground seems to
be rushing up to meet you... that's the moment

858
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,170
to flare.'

859
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:48,190
By the time they got up in the air, Francesca
was quite nervous.

860
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:53,859
She was trying to concentrate on flying, but
she couldn't stop thinking about the scene

861
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:57,500
with Mrs Barker and Doug's treatment of his
daughter.

862
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:05,390
It had shocked her tremendously - the anger
and violence hidden just beneath the surface.

863
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,030
She wondered if this was Doug's true nature.

864
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:12,940
The more she got to know him, the less she
liked him.

865
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:20,020
They climbed to 1000 feet and flew down the
western side of the airfield, parallel to

866
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,020
the runway.

867
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:27,830
It was windier than usual and Francesca found
it difficult to control the plane; she couldn't

868
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:33,200
seem to find the right power to keep the plane
straight and level.

869
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,600
Soon they were turning back towards the airfield.

870
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,119
The runway lay ahead in the distance.

871
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,900
Doug began a steady stream of instructions.

872
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,010
'OK, reduce power,' he said.

873
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:47,770
'Hold her steady at 80.

874
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:52,360
Not too slow... keep your speed up.'

875
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,180
Francesca looked along the nose.

876
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:59,710
The runway was creeping towards them, growing
bigger all the time, but it was a little over

877
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,710
to the left.

878
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,230
'Keep the plane in line with the runway!'

879
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,230
Doug called.

880
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:08,580
'You're not on the centre line.'

881
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,200
Francesca tried to correct their direction,
but when she did so, the nose came up.

882
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,290
'Watch your speed!'

883
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,290
Doug shouted.

884
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:20,240
'You're down to 65!'

885
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,650
Francesca pushed in the throttle, but it was
too much.

886
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,590
Instantly, the plane rose upwards.

887
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:33,410
Francesca pushed the control column forward,
then at last regained control.

888
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,210
'Are you OK?'

889
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,880
Doug asked, glancing across.

890
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,090
'I'm fine,' Francesca answered quickly.

891
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:47,140
'Right, try and keep her like this then,'
he said.

892
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:51,970
Francesca's eyes flashed between the dials
inside the cockpit and the runway visible

893
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:53,420
above the nose.

894
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,980
The plane slipped slowly down towards the
ground.

895
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,700
The runway was getting closer and closer,
the black and white stripes at its end like

896
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,710
a set of piano keys.

897
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:10,100
'Aim just beyond the piano keys,' Doug said,
more gently now.

898
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,450
'That's good.

899
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,450
Hold it there.

900
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,980
Now watch for the ground rush.'

901
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,040
Francesca froze.

902
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,030
What did it mean?

903
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,520
What was the 'ground rush'?

904
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,390
The runway already looked huge.

905
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,800
She waited.

906
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,830
Should she pull back now?

907
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,340
Surely they would hit the ground at any moment!

908
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:36,450
She pulled back on the control column and
at the same time reduced the power.

909
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,120
As the nose lifted, the runway disappeared
from sight.

910
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:46,550
They seemed to be flying on blindly, the plane
hanging in the air only a couple of metres

911
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,900
above the ground.

912
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:54,140
They held like that for an age, speed dropping,
like a boat sinking in the water.

913
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,510
Then, suddenly, there was a terrific bang.

914
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,260
For a second, Francesca thought they'd crashed.

915
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:05,570
Then she realised the main wheels had hit
the ground.

916
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:14,260
'OK, push the control column forward slowly
to bring down the nose wheel,' Doug called.

917
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,750
Francesca obeyed automatically.

918
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:22,050
She watched the nose slowly drop, then felt
the front wheel touch the ground.

919
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:26,930
The plane rolled steadily forward, eventually
coming to a stop.

920
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:31,670
'All right, take her off the runway,' Doug
instructed.

921
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,440
'Then let's have a talk.'

922
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,580
Francesca did as she was told.

923
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:43,370
She felt suddenly hot and embarrassed; the
headphones were tight on her ears.

924
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:48,320
'OK, stop here,' Doug said.

925
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,730
Francesca brought the plane to a stop.

926
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,940
She felt afraid of what Doug was going to
say; the landing had been so heavy.

927
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,730
'Have I damaged the plane?'

928
01:00:58,730 --> 01:00:59,730
she began.

929
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:01,660
'There was so much to think about.

930
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,930
I didn't expect -'

931
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,690
'Don't worry about it,' Doug interrupted.

932
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:11,510
He turned towards Francesca and looked at
her closely.

933
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,140
'Heavy landings are quite normal at this stage.

934
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,800
But you're not concentrating today.

935
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,420
There's something on your mind.'

936
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,740
Francesca blinked.

937
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,300
Was it really so obvious?

938
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,370
She didn't know what to say.

939
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,690
'I...

940
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,380
I didn't sleep well last night.

941
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:34,859
Maybe that's it,' she said a bit desperately.

942
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:36,930
Doug raised his eyebrows.

943
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,730
He kept his eyes on her.

944
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:45,950
'I hope you're happy with the lessons,' he
went on quietly.

945
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:52,280
Francesca felt completely frozen: the harness
trapping her back against the seat, the cockpit

946
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,580
tinier than ever.

947
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:57,500
'Of course,' she lied.

948
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,040
Doug continued to watch her.

949
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:06,750
Then, keeping his eyes on her all the time,
he stretched out his hand and placed it on

950
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:10,580
top of hers where she was resting it on her
knees.

951
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:15,570
'Good,' he said, squeezing her hand very gently.

952
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:21,190
'Because I'm very happy with you.'

953
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,640
Francesca didn't move.

954
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,540
Doug's words seemed to hang in the cockpit.

955
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,890
She felt suddenly sick.

956
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:37,130
The image of a huge fleshy spider resting
on the back of her hand flashed into her mind.

957
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:41,690
After a moment or two more, Doug took his
hand away.

958
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:47,390
'Right, turn the aircraft round and take her
back to the runway,' he said.

959
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:53,260
'Let's see if we can get these landings sorted
out today.'

960
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,830
Francesca was still frozen.

961
01:02:55,830 --> 01:03:01,000
Although Doug had removed his hand, it still
felt as though there was a spider resting

962
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,540
on hers.

963
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,550
She had to look to check there wasn't one
there.

964
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:10,570
'OK, let's go,' Doug said.

965
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:13,470
Francesca tried to refocus on flying.

966
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:17,859
She reached forward to the throttle and pushed
it in to increase the power.

967
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:22,210
The plane leapt forward fast, too fast.

968
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:24,590
Immediately, she pulled at the control column.

969
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:25,590
'Whoah!'

970
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,710
Doug called.

971
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,220
'We don't want to take off!'

972
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:34,710
Using his controls, he brought the plane to
a stop.

973
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,030
Francesca closed her eyes.

974
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:41,370
She felt her arms shaking slightly as she
held the control column.

975
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:43,750
She was sure it must be noticeable.

976
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:48,990
All of a sudden she felt a hand on her leg.

977
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,600
Francesca's eyes shot open.

978
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,050
She looked down to see the man squeezing the
top of her leg gently.

979
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,840
'Take your hand off me!'

980
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,800
she shouted.

981
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,599
Doug smiled at her across the cockpit.

982
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:09,490
'Whatever you say,' he said casually and slowly
removed his hand.

983
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:11,910
'Shame,' he added more quietly.

984
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,880
'I guess we'd better concentrate on these
landings.'

985
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,520
All of a sudden Francesca knew she couldn't
go on.

986
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,869
'I want to stop.

987
01:04:21,869 --> 01:04:25,050
I want to stop the lesson,' Francesca said
quickly.

988
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,530
'I don't feel very well.'

989
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,990
Doug looked across and raised his eyebrows.

990
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:38,050
For a moment she thought he was going to lean
across and try to kiss her, and she froze.

991
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:41,540
Then, with heavy sarcasm, he said.

992
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,730
'As you wish.

993
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:49,030
Don't want an unhappy client, do we?'

994
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,609
Francesca didn't reply.

995
01:04:51,609 --> 01:05:04,050
Doug took over the controls and took the plane
back towards the hangar without speaking.

996
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,300
CHAPTER EIGHT

997
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,300
Coffee break

998
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:14,790
When Francesca marched out of the Fastwings
office that afternoon, she had just missed

999
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:20,190
one bus into the city and it was almost a
two-hour wait till the next.

1000
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,369
She didn't care.

1001
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:26,270
It was just a relief to be out of the place
and away from Doug.

1002
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:31,920
For fifteen minutes she walked as fast as
she could, going wherever her footsteps took

1003
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,910
her, dragging her hand through her hair, as
if by doing so she might empty her head of

1004
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:44,020
the memory of Doug's hand on hers - the imaginary
spider.

1005
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:49,180
When she had at last calmed down, she found
she had walked right round to the other side

1006
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,830
of the airfield.

1007
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:57,130
As she was walking back towards the airfield
gates, a sign on the hangar she was passing

1008
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,800
caught her eye.

1009
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:06,010
'Flying Start: Pilot Training,' it read - it
was the other flying school she'd been looking

1010
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,580
at online the night before.

1011
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,910
A small door was cut into the hangar wall.

1012
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:18,420
Perhaps if it hadn't been open, Francesca
wouldn't have thought to go and look any closer.

1013
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,750
But as it was, she wandered across and looked
through the doorway.

1014
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:29,820
There was little light inside, but she could
make out the shape of several aircraft in

1015
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,000
the darkness.

1016
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,140
Without thinking, Francesca stepped inside
and began making her way around the planes.

1017
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:43,690
They were parked tightly together, wings almost
touching.

1018
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:49,580
Slowly, she made her way among them, studying
them as if she were looking at pictures in

1019
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,580
an art gallery.

1020
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:59,240
Towards the back she saw an ancient yellow
plane, but behind that, the shape of an expensive

1021
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,760
executive jet caught her eye.

1022
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,619
She went over to look at it more closely,
admiring the smart green and gold paintwork,

1023
01:07:08,619 --> 01:07:12,109
and the eager hungry shape of its nose.

1024
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:14,040
'Beautiful, isn't she?'

1025
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,800
a voice behind her said.

1026
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,160
Francesca swung round.

1027
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:26,700
A young man of about twenty-five, with longish
brown hair and wearing blue work clothes,

1028
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,849
approached.

1029
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:33,510
He bent his head to pass under a wing, wiping
his hands on an oily cloth.

1030
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,250
'I'm sorry,' Francesca began.

1031
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:43,910
'I didn't realise there was anyone here,'
she added, noticing now a light aircraft behind

1032
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:46,260
him, its engine cover open.

1033
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:49,380
'The door was open, so I...'

1034
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,650
'No problem,' the man replied.

1035
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,720
'As long as you weren't planning to steal
one!'

1036
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:02,280
Then, pointing at the jet, he went on, 'Yes,
she belongs to Harry Moore - you know, the

1037
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,609
furniture man.

1038
01:08:03,609 --> 01:08:10,580
Uses it to pop around Europe and check that
everyone's making him lots of money.'

1039
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,070
Francesca smiled.

1040
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:15,510
She had no idea who Harry Moore was.

1041
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:20,160
But this young man had a friendly and amusing
way of speaking.

1042
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,000
And he looked funny.

1043
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,150
He had a big nose and there was a big black
mark down the side of it, where he must have

1044
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,710
rubbed oil from his hand.

1045
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,569
'Anyway,' he went on, 'can I help?

1046
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:38,410
You're not interested in flying lessons, are
you?'

1047
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:40,460
Francesca felt embarrassed.

1048
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:46,270
'Well, umm... actually I'm already having
lessons.

1049
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:51,170
To be honest I'm just - how do you say?

1050
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,770
- killing time.'

1051
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:57,060
She was about to explain about the bus when
the man broke in.

1052
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,020
'Oh, hold on a minute.

1053
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:06,770
You must be Doug's Swiss-Italian, is that
right?' he asked, then cut himself short.

1054
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:10,279
'Oh dear, that doesn't sound very good, does
it?

1055
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:16,650
I'm really sorry; I just heard someone say
Doug had a foreign student taking flying lessons.

1056
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:21,100
You're quite famous, you know.'

1057
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,589
Francesca wasn't sure she liked this idea.

1058
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:28,819
But there was something light and easy about
the man's way of speaking, and he'd made a

1059
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:33,299
funny face at his mistake which relaxed her
immediately.

1060
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:38,460
After all the tension of the afternoon it
was a wonderful relief.

1061
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,609
'Do you work for Flying Start?'

1062
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:42,700
she asked.

1063
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
'Yes,' the man answered.

1064
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,089
'I'm the office manager.'

1065
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:48,089
He smiled.

1066
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:54,840
'Big title, small job - I answer the phone
and help maintain the aircraft and so on.

1067
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,250
Tom Brennan's the name,' he said.

1068
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:06,510
As he did so, he put out his hand, then realising
it was covered in oil, took it back, smiling.

1069
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:10,690
'Sorry, probably not such a good idea.'

1070
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,690
Francesca laughed.

1071
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,650
'No problem.

1072
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,550
And I'm Francesca Bartolli,' she said.

1073
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:21,090
'Nice to meet you,' he said.

1074
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,630
Francesca smiled.

1075
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,750
'Good to meet you, too,' she said.

1076
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:33,110
They looked at each other for a second or
two, uncertain how to continue, then Tom went

1077
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:34,110
on.

1078
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:37,880
'I don't suppose you fancy a cup of coffee,
do you?

1079
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,650
I'm just about to make one.'

1080
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,890
Francesca hesitated.

1081
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,300
'Aren't you busy?'

1082
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,300
she asked.

1083
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,720
'I was about to have a break anyway,' Tom
said.

1084
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,400
'I'll just go and wash my hands.'

1085
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,090
Tom led the way round the planes and out of
the hangar into a small office.

1086
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:05,730
Over to one side there was a small sofa and
a table covered in flying magazines.

1087
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,230
Leaving her there, Tom went off to the washroom.

1088
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:16,500
A few minutes later, he reappeared, carrying
two cups of steaming coffee.

1089
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,790
'There,' he said.

1090
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:25,190
'Not exactly cafe latte, but at least it's
hot and wet.'

1091
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:32,120
When she tasted the coffee, Francesca realised
the man hadn't been joking - it was awful.

1092
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:39,000
But she didn't care; it was just such a relaxing
atmosphere after being with Doug.

1093
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,780
'It's drinkable,' she said with a smile.

1094
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:46,600
Tom laughed and sat down beside the desk.

1095
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,710
'So,' he began, 'how are your lessons going?'

1096
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:56,290
'Not too badly, I think,' Francesca answered.

1097
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,670
'I didn't do very well today though.

1098
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,210
I made quite a mess of my first landing.'

1099
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,210
Tom grinned.

1100
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,900
'You're alive, aren't you?

1101
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:09,960
You know the definition of a good landing?'
he asked.

1102
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,500
'One that you are able to walk away from.'

1103
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,520
Francesca laughed.

1104
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,690
Tom went on.

1105
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:22,440
'So, why do you want to learn to fly?' he
asked lightly.

1106
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:28,730
'I want to be a commercial pilot,' Francesca
answered.

1107
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:30,920
Tom sat up in surprise.

1108
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,090
'Wow!' he said.

1109
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,250
'Good for you!

1110
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,690
I'm impressed.

1111
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:39,380
So why are you learning here?

1112
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:43,940
Not enough flat land back home in Switzerland?'

1113
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:48,170
Francesca laughed again and explained all
about it.

1114
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,400
Tom listened carefully.

1115
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:56,500
Soon Francesca realised she'd told him all
about her family and home and then they'd

1116
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:03,640
moved on to discuss all things Swiss and Italian:
the people and food, even the Italian language.

1117
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,930
Twenty minutes had passed before she knew
it.

1118
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:11,650
'And what about you?'

1119
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,880
Francesca asked the moment there was a break
in the conversation.

1120
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,750
'I suppose you got your pilot's licence years
ago.'

1121
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,870
'Actually, no,' Tom replied.

1122
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:29,140
'My father was a pilot in the Royal Air Force
- and thought I'd be brilliant, but to be

1123
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:32,320
perfectly honest, I didn't enjoy it much.

1124
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,800
Got in a total panic and scared the instructor
out of his pants.

1125
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,010
I'm happier on the ground.

1126
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:43,020
But I still think planes are very beautiful.'

1127
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,680
'Yes, I know what you mean.

1128
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:52,520
My friends all thought I was crazy when I
said that,' she replied, happy to have found

1129
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,010
someone who felt the same.

1130
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:02,180
They fell silent for a moment and she suddenly
began to wonder if she'd stayed too long.

1131
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,700
'I'm sorry,' she said.

1132
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:09,540
'I ought to go and let you get on with your
work.'

1133
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,580
Tom gave a small smile.

1134
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,600
'Yes, I suppose so,' he said uncertainly.

1135
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,210
'The boss will be back soon.'

1136
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,239
Francesca felt awkward.

1137
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:25,620
They both stood up, a bit embarrassed.

1138
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:32,090
As Francesca got to her feet, she noticed
the drawing of a bird - an owl - on a notepad

1139
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,090
on the desk.

1140
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:37,010
It was beautiful: detailed and delicate.

1141
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:40,610
Tom saw her looking at it.

1142
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,710
'The head's not quite right,' he said.

1143
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,440
'I've got to do that bit again.'

1144
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,850
'You drew it?'

1145
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:49,880
Francesca asked.

1146
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,960
'But it's lovely!'

1147
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,570
she went on, genuinely impressed.

1148
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,590
'It must have taken ages.'

1149
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:02,460
'About half an hour,' Tom replied.

1150
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:09,440
'Sometimes there isn't a lot to do in the
office,' he added with a laugh.

1151
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,650
Francesca studied it carefully.

1152
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,310
'It's fantastic,' she said at last.

1153
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:19,540
'Do you draw other things as well as birds?'

1154
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:23,400
'Well, people sometimes,' he answered.

1155
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,730
'But mostly birds and planes.

1156
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,300
Anything that flies, I suppose.'

1157
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:34,500
'You've got a real talent,' Francesca said.

1158
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,740
Tom looked a bit embarrassed.

1159
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:42,850
Then, all of a sudden, he tore off the sheet
with the bird and handed it to Francesca.

1160
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,410
'Here,' he said.

1161
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:47,800
'A small gift.'

1162
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,480
Francesca protested only briefly before accepting
the drawing.

1163
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,500
Tom showed her out of the hangar.

1164
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:59,940
'Well, good luck with your flying lessons,'
he said once they were outside.

1165
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:06,000
'Doug's certainly a brilliant pilot, or so
I've heard.'

1166
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,250
Francesca's heart sank.

1167
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:12,500
For the last half-hour, she'd forgotten all
about Doug.

1168
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,680
She didn't say anything.

1169
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,980
'Drop in again next time you're here,' Tom
said suddenly.

1170
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:23,800
'I'm nearly always around if you fancy another
coffee.'

1171
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,370
Francesca smiled and put out her hand.

1172
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:29,730
Their eyes met for a second.

1173
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:33,190
She wondered if she would see Tom again.

1174
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:38,080
Then she set off down the path towards the
airfield gates.

1175
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,560
When she'd gone ten metres or so, she couldn't
help glancing round.

1176
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,670
Tom was still standing in the doorway.

1177
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:56,940
With a little wave, he immediately disappeared
back into the office.

1178
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,940
CHAPTER NINE

1179
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,270
A difficult phone call

1180
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:08,880
As soon as she'd put Sam and Emma to bed that
evening, Francesca hurried up the stairs to

1181
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,380
her room, turned on her laptop, and opened
up the Flying Start website.

1182
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:23,320
Reading through all the details now, she couldn't
understand why she'd ever chosen Fastwings.

1183
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:30,190
Flying Start had more aircraft, more instructors,
and offered several more courses.

1184
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:37,060
Besides that, now she examined the website
more closely, the whole place seemed more

1185
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,920
attractive.

1186
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:46,170
In a section called 'Gallery' there was a
huge display of photos: aircraft in flight,

1187
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:52,840
aircraft on the ground, sunlit landscapes
taken from the air, the same scenes repeated

1188
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,940
with snow on the ground.

1189
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:01,870
Francesca looked at them, feeling increasingly
annoyed, unable to believe that she'd ignored

1190
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:04,270
them before.

1191
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:07,900
There was another section called 'Staff.

1192
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,739
This time she checked the photos more carefully:
there seemed to be three main instructors

1193
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:22,070
- two youngish men: Nick Downing and Brian
Hamilton, and a much older man, George Scott.

1194
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,480
Next, there was a photo of Tom.

1195
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,170
Francesca looked at it for a long time.

1196
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:35,150
It was unmistakeably him - the nose was so
recognisable.

1197
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:39,800
He was standing beside one of the aircraft,
smiling shyly.

1198
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:44,730
He looked kind and honest, his eyes wide and
warm.

1199
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:48,940
Had she really seen the photograph before?

1200
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:53,940
She couldn't remember it and felt slightly
ashamed at the thought.

1201
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:58,040
She glanced at the drawing of the owl that
she'd already put on the noticeboard above

1202
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,330
her desk.

1203
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:04,070
If only she had taken up lessons at Flying
Start!

1204
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:10,420
But she'd paid for the whole private pilot's
licence course with Doug; she was committed

1205
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,750
to lessons with him.

1206
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:18,770
The memory of his hand on her hand and leg
came flooding back.

1207
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:24,489
She could feel it even now - like a huge great
tarantula creeping up her body.

1208
01:19:24,489 --> 01:19:29,770
It made her feel sick; it made her want to
scream!

1209
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:35,380
Quite why she didn't close down the laptop
at that moment, she never fully understood.

1210
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:39,850
Later, she wished she had just shut it down
and gone to bed.

1211
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:47,460
But after hesitating for a few seconds, she
did a search for Doug by typing in his name.

1212
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:54,110
Instantly, half a dozen 'Doug Barkers' appeared
with Facebook entries.

1213
01:19:54,110 --> 01:20:01,190
She quickly checked the photos one by one,
but they were clearly not the Doug she knew.

1214
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:06,180
Next she tried 'Doug Barker Flying Instructor'.

1215
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,420
This time the results were different.

1216
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:15,070
An entry half the way down the page caught
her eye.

1217
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:18,750
'Flying instructor wins damages' it read.

1218
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:24,940
It appeared to be from a newspaper, The Southampton
Herald.

1219
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:30,730
With a feeling of sickness about what she
might discover, Francesca opened the page

1220
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:36,170
and saw a photo of the Doug Barker she knew
only too well.

1221
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:40,120
He was standing beside an aircraft, hand on
its nose.

1222
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,050
Below the photograph, was a report.

1223
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:47,469
With increasing horror, Francesca read:

1224
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:53,860
A Southampton flying instructor yesterday
won damages against a woman who had accused

1225
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:56,810
him of sexual harassment.

1226
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:04,719
The woman, who remains unnamed, had accused
Doug Barker, 37, of making sexual advances

1227
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:09,040
to her while she was receiving flying lessons
from him.

1228
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:15,190
The woman yesterday admitted in court that
she was unable to provide evidence and all

1229
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:18,620
charges against Mr Barker were dropped.

1230
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:24,770
The judge ordered the woman to pay Barker
2500 pounds in damages...

1231
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:32,770
It was a very long time before Francesca got
to sleep that night.

1232
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:40,290
At ten o'clock the next morning, Francesca,
sat down at the desk in her room, and picked

1233
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:42,530
up her mobile phone.

1234
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:48,940
After closing her eyes for a second or two,
she searched down through the numbers until

1235
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,520
she found the one for Fastwings.

1236
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:57,550
Then, before she could change her mind, she
pressed the Call button.

1237
01:21:57,550 --> 01:22:00,750
The number rang for a very long time.

1238
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:06,580
Half of Francesca was praying that it wouldn't
be answered, but just as she was about to

1239
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:10,730
give up, she heard Doug's voice.

1240
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:14,320
'Fastwings,' was all he said.

1241
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,900
Francesca decided she must sound firm.

1242
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:23,000
Taking a deep breath, she said, 'Hello, it's
Francesca here...

1243
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,340
Francesca Bartolli.'

1244
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,750
Doug gave a short cruel laugh.

1245
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:33,930
'Ah, Francesca Bartolli,' he responded sarcastically.

1246
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:41,070
'For a moment, I thought it might be the other
Francesca I teach.'

1247
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,070
Francesca didn't respond.

1248
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:47,430
She hated Doug now; hated him with all her
heart.

1249
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:53,440
'So, what can I do for Francesca?' he asked.

1250
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,020
Francesca took another deep breath.

1251
01:22:56,020 --> 01:23:04,050
'I'm ringing,' she said, 'because I've decided
I must cancel.'

1252
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,180
There was a slight pause.

1253
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,040
Then Doug spoke again.

1254
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,960
'I see,' he said carefully.

1255
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,820
'When would you like your lesson instead?'

1256
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,200
Francesca put a hand to her head.

1257
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,820
'No,' she said more quietly.

1258
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:24,090
'I mean I want to cancel the course.

1259
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:28,130
I've decided not to continue the flying lessons.'

1260
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:32,730
There was a long silence after that.

1261
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:36,420
Francesca's hand trembled as she waited for
Doug's response.

1262
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,350
The silence went on and on.

1263
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:43,670
Finally, Francesca decided something must
be wrong.

1264
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:46,050
'Are you still there?'

1265
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,290
she asked.

1266
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:52,550
'Oh yes, I'm here,' Doug replied.

1267
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:55,340
He didn't say anything more.

1268
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:59,120
Francesca felt a tight ball in her throat.

1269
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,360
At last Doug broke the silence.

1270
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:06,200
'What's the problem, Francesca?' he asked.

1271
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:10,520
'Just because I put my hand on you a couple
of times to calm you down...

1272
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,930
Is that really so terrible?'

1273
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:16,710
'It wasn't to calm me down,' she replied quickly.

1274
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,910
'What was it then?'

1275
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:20,050
Doug asked.

1276
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:24,650
'You know very well,' she protested.

1277
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:26,650
'But it's not only that - it's...'

1278
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,820
She stopped.

1279
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,060
Francesca didn't know what to say.

1280
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:36,040
She didn't want to say anything about what
she'd read the previous night.

1281
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,570
She bit her lip.

1282
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:43,650
'What exactly are you accusing me of, Francesca?'

1283
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:46,710
Doug asked quietly.

1284
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,960
Francesca searched for words.

1285
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,890
She'd prepared in advance what she was going
to say, but now the memory of that newspaper

1286
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:57,590
article had wiped all the words from her head.

1287
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:58,730
'I...

1288
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:04,080
I just want to stop,' Francesca said, her
nerve failing her.

1289
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,880
'I can't explain.

1290
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,969
I'm sorry.

1291
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:10,090
It was a mistake.'

1292
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:13,260
After another pause, Doug spoke again.

1293
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,500
'I see,' he said.

1294
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:21,170
'So you're not going to have lessons somewhere
else then?'

1295
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:23,110
Francesca hesitated.

1296
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:28,219
Although she'd expected the question, now
she realised she had made the mistake of not

1297
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:30,830
deciding firmly on the answer.

1298
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:34,110
'I haven't made any plans,' she said.

1299
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:35,280
'I'm not sure.

1300
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,360
I may go back to Switzerland.'

1301
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,420
It came out before she knew she was going
to say it.

1302
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:46,840
'What a pity,' Doug replied, with a hint of
sarcasm.

1303
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:49,770
'Yes,' Francesca said.

1304
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:53,080
There was another silence.

1305
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:58,620
'Well, don't expect any of your money back,'
Doug said finally.

1306
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,050
'What do you mean?'

1307
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:02,050
Francesca asked.

1308
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:05,170
'You can't keep my money!'

1309
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,650
There was a pause.

1310
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,450
Then Doug spoke again.

1311
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:11,219
'I don't know about that, Francesca.

1312
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:18,960
You see, the way I understand it, we had a
contract - a contract for a whole flying course,

1313
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,810
and now you're trying to break the contract.

1314
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:29,220
I think I can do whatever I like and you don't
have a leg to stand on.'

1315
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:32,630
Francesca felt panic rising suddenly in her
throat.

1316
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,820
'I...

1317
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,360
I don't understand.

1318
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,360
What do you mean, "a leg to stand on"?'

1319
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:47,200
'I mean, you can't do anything about it, Francesca,'
Doug answered slowly.

1320
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:56,210
'If I decide not to give you any money back,
then that's your hard luck.'

1321
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,020
Francesca didn't know what to do.

1322
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,000
She could hardly breathe.

1323
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
'But you can't do that!'

1324
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,170
she said.

1325
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:10,670
'Listen, Ms Bartolli,' Doug replied with exaggerated
politeness.

1326
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:16,489
'You've called to tell me you want to break
your contract and as good as accused me of

1327
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:17,860
trying to rape you!

1328
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:20,440
How do expect me to react?

1329
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,840
Who exactly do you think you are?

1330
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,300
It seems to me you've got a pretty big idea
of yourself!'

1331
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,460
Francesca felt tears coming and it made her
furious.

1332
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:35,250
She never cried.

1333
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,320
She didn't know what to do, what to say.

1334
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,750
Suddenly she felt completely out of her depth.

1335
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:47,690
'Please,' she said desperately, hating herself
for being weak.

1336
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:50,760
'Don't do this to me!'

1337
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,830
There was another pause.

1338
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:56,080
'Well, I'll have to think about it.

1339
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,930
You say you're going back to Switzerland?'

1340
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:02,140
Francesca fought against the tears.

1341
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,490
'Probably,' she muttered.

1342
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:13,390
'Because if you decide to join another flying
school here, I will be very, very angry,'

1343
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:16,280
he went on.

1344
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,570
Francesca felt the tears rising up through
her body and all of a sudden, just as they

1345
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:23,989
burst, she shouted out down the phone.

1346
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:26,300
'Oh, stop it, please!

1347
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,480
Just leave me alone!'

1348
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:33,920
Then, without knowing she was about to say
it, she added, 'I wish I'd never come here.

1349
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,780
I hate it here in England.

1350
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:37,830
I just want to go home!'

1351
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:44,730
With that, she ended the call and in a sudden
fit of despair, threw the phone hard down

1352
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:46,050
onto her bed.

1353
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:49,989
It bounced once, and crashed against the wall.

1354
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:55,870
As the flood of tears streamed from her eyes,
Francesca saw that the phone had broken open

1355
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,989
and the battery had fallen onto the floor.

1356
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:09,420
She threw herself onto the bed and covered
her head with the pillow.

1357
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,420
CHAPTER TEN

1358
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,270
A fresh start

1359
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:21,880
'I don't understand why you have to leave,'
Sam said bitterly, kicking his heels against

1360
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,390
the park bench.

1361
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:29,570
'I don't want you to go back to Switzerland.'

1362
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,969
Francesca gave a deep sigh.

1363
01:29:31,969 --> 01:29:37,800
It was over a week later and she was sitting
in the park near the Thompson's house, watching

1364
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,469
the children play in the warm May sunshine.

1365
01:29:42,469 --> 01:29:49,830
After playing on the swings for a good while,
Sam had come over and sunk down beside Francesca,

1366
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:50,950
exhausted.

1367
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:55,180
'I'm sorry, Sam,' Francesca began.

1368
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:01,730
'It's very difficult to explain, but I've
had to change my plans.'

1369
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,090
'But why?'

1370
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:06,020
the little boy asked.

1371
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:13,780
'Because... because things haven't worked
out the way I'd hoped,' Francesca answered.

1372
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:20,500
'But you said you were going to be a pilot,'
Sam said with a frown.

1373
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:26,420
'You said you were going to fly planes!'

1374
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,489
Francesca dropped her head.

1375
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:33,840
Mrs Thompson had warned Francesca how upset
the children would be.

1376
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:40,890
Sam was such a sweet little boy and she loved
him dearly, but she wished he would stop.

1377
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:45,570
Making the decision to go home to Switzerland
had been terrible enough.

1378
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:54,120
Now, if the children were going to question
her in this way, it would be unbearable.

1379
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:59,730
Francesca had told Mrs Thompson of her decision
the day after the phone call to Doug.

1380
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,880
Mrs Thompson had been quite disappointed herself.

1381
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,800
'Oh no, not really?'

1382
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,800
she'd said.

1383
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,430
'But I thought you were enjoying it here.

1384
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:16,840
And you seemed to be doing so well with the
flying lessons!'

1385
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,210
Francesca hadn't known what to say.

1386
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:24,780
For some reason she didn't want to tell Mrs
Thompson about Doug's behaviour or what she'd

1387
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,190
read.

1388
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,800
She didn't want to tell anyone.

1389
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:35,260
She couldn't properly understand it herself,
but she felt strangely ashamed - as though

1390
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,060
she was partly responsible for what had happened.

1391
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:46,340
Instead, she told Mrs Thompson that taking
flying lessons in a foreign language had proved

1392
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:50,880
to be more difficult than she'd realised at
the beginning.

1393
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,580
Francesca guessed that Mrs Thompson hadn't
really believed it.

1394
01:31:54,580 --> 01:32:00,750
But the woman was sensitive enough not to
press Francesca for any further explanation.

1395
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:08,190
She simply said how sorry she was, and how
sorry the children would be to see her go.

1396
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:13,410
Francesca's departure was set for a month's
time - the period of notice she was obliged

1397
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,660
to give according to her contract.

1398
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:23,940
Doug's threat not to return the money for
the unused lessons had also dominated Francesca's

1399
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,570
thoughts all week.

1400
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:33,370
As each day passed her anxiety grew, until
finally Mrs Thompson asked what was worrying

1401
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,530
her so much.

1402
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:42,140
Francesca explained what Doug had said about
her breaking the contract and losing her money.

1403
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:48,210
Mrs Thompson was shocked and that night told
her husband, who was a solicitor.

1404
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:54,370
Mr Thompson took one look at the paperwork
Francesca had received from Fastwings, and

1405
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,810
said, 'The man's talking rubbish!

1406
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:02,210
What's the telephone number of this place?'

1407
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:07,780
Francesca didn't hear the phone call, but
a short while later Mr Thompson appeared saying,

1408
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,350
'What a thoroughly unpleasant man.

1409
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:14,100
I think you're better off having nothing more
to do with him!'

1410
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:20,520
Two days later, a cheque had arrived in the
post.

1411
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:25,520
The sound of someone calling her name brought
Francesca back to the present and made her

1412
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,720
look up.

1413
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:32,530
A cyclist had stopped about ten metres away
and was calling across.

1414
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:33,830
'Francesca?

1415
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:37,750
Yes, it is!'

1416
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:44,650
Francesca stared for a moment, still lost
in her thoughts, then realised who it was.

1417
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:47,730
The man was already wheeling his bike towards
her.

1418
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:50,100
'Do you remember me?

1419
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:54,620
Tom Brennan... from Flying Start?'

1420
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,640
Francesca blinked a couple of times.

1421
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,410
'But, of course I do,' she answered.

1422
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:06,660
'Nice to see you again,' she said, genuinely
pleased to see a friendly face.

1423
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,520
'Great to see you, too,' Tom said.

1424
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,520
'How are you?

1425
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,219
How are things?'

1426
01:34:12,219 --> 01:34:19,680
Francesca paused for a moment before replying,
wondering what to tell him.

1427
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,420
But there was no point in going into the whole
business with Doug.

1428
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:28,540
'I'm fine,' she said, as Sam went running
off back to the swings.

1429
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:33,449
Then, she went on quickly: 'How about you?'

1430
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:37,070
'Oh, same as ever,' Tom answered.

1431
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:42,340
He went on immediately: 'Seeing you here is
really funny because I was thinking about

1432
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,340
you only yesterday.'

1433
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:49,020
Francesca frowned, not quite sure what was
coming next.

1434
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:55,440
'Yeah, you see I noticed there was a new film
out at the cinema, a film about Amelia Earhart,

1435
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,260
you know-'

1436
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:03,460
Francesca interrupted him: 'Yes, the first
woman to fly across the Atlantic.'

1437
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:05,900
'That's right,' he went on.

1438
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,840
'Anyway, I just thought...'

1439
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,340
He seemed to lose confidence all of a sudden.

1440
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:20,440
'Well, I just wondered if you'd like to see
it... if you're not busy, that is.'

1441
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:24,710
Francesca's heart gave a little leap, excited
at the thought.

1442
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:29,040
But then, just as quickly, her heart fell.

1443
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,660
She was leaving for Switzerland in less than
a month.

1444
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:35,620
What was the point of getting to know him
better?

1445
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:39,429
It was just stupid and unfair.

1446
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:42,430
Tom misunderstood Francesca's silence.

1447
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:47,890
'Sorry,' Tom went on, rubbing the side of
his nose all of a sudden.

1448
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:53,840
'I just thought that as it was a film about
flying and a famous woman pilot, you might

1449
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,840
-'

1450
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:02,820
'Oh, I'd love to it see it,' Francesca said
looking him directly in the eyes, 'and I really

1451
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:08,270
appreciate you asking, but there's something
you should know.'

1452
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:10,140
'You've got a boyfriend...'

1453
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,320
Tom said.

1454
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,570
Francesca took a breath.

1455
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:16,429
'No, no, it's not that.

1456
01:36:16,429 --> 01:36:21,840
The fact is I'm going back to Switzerland
in three weeks' time.'

1457
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,449
'What!'

1458
01:36:23,449 --> 01:36:24,630
Tom said.

1459
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:28,429
'Yes, I decided...'

1460
01:36:28,429 --> 01:36:29,679
Francesca paused.

1461
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:30,750
'Why?'

1462
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:33,969
Tom asked, concerned.

1463
01:36:33,969 --> 01:36:36,120
'What's happened?'

1464
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,760
Francesca thought about the excuse she'd given
Mrs Thompson.

1465
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,650
But for some reason the words seemed to stick
in her throat.

1466
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:46,440
Tom broke in, embarrassed.

1467
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,840
'I'm sorry.

1468
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:53,190
It's none of my business, but I'd heard you
were doing brilliantly at Fastwings,' Tom

1469
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,190
said.

1470
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:55,680
'You were getting on well with Doug-'

1471
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:58,470
'I wasn't,' Francesca cut in.

1472
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:59,730
'Sorry?'

1473
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:07,010
'I wasn't getting on with him at all,' Francesca
answered, strangely relieved to have told

1474
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:08,810
him the truth.

1475
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:10,120
'Why?'

1476
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:13,040
Tom answered, clearly very surprised.

1477
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:18,449
'I don't want to go into the reasons,' Francesca
said quickly.

1478
01:37:18,449 --> 01:37:21,500
'I just don't like him, that's all.

1479
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:26,320
He wasn't very nice to me and I don't like
the way he treats his children either.

1480
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,560
He frightens me, actually.'

1481
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,670
'Oh...'

1482
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:34,280
Tom answered, trying to absorb what he'd just
heard.

1483
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:39,060
'I must say I'd heard Doug could be quite
a hard instructor.

1484
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:43,150
And I think he's going through a bit of a
bad time just now,' he added.

1485
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,800
'All the same...'

1486
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,219
'What do you mean?'

1487
01:37:47,219 --> 01:37:48,219
Francesca asked.

1488
01:37:48,219 --> 01:37:50,350
'What kind of bad time?'

1489
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:54,570
'Oh, I don't know,' Tom answered.

1490
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:57,650
'Financial problems, I think.

1491
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:01,320
Apparently he borrowed a lot of money to set
up Fastwings.

1492
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,970
And personal things, as well.

1493
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:08,780
There's a rumour his marriage is on the rocks,
actually.'

1494
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,730
Francesca was silent for a moment.

1495
01:38:10,730 --> 01:38:18,090
The idea of the man's private life collapsing
would only make him more unstable and it frightened

1496
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,550
her more than ever.

1497
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:25,989
'But anyway, that's no reason for you to stop
your lessons,' Tom went on, interrupting her

1498
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:26,989
thoughts.

1499
01:38:26,989 --> 01:38:31,280
'You've come this far - you simply mustn't
give up.

1500
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,489
Come and have a try at Flying Start.

1501
01:38:33,489 --> 01:38:35,160
We'd love to have you.'

1502
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,650
'I'm sorry, Tom,' Francesca said.

1503
01:38:38,650 --> 01:38:39,850
'Something's happened.

1504
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:43,429
I've lost my confidence, I think...'

1505
01:38:43,429 --> 01:38:44,429
'What!

1506
01:38:44,429 --> 01:38:47,250
I can't believe that,' Tom protested.

1507
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:51,210
'I can't carry on, Tom,' she said.

1508
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:54,280
'I feel a complete mess.

1509
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:59,850
Besides, Doug would be furious if he knew
I was starting lessons with you.'

1510
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,170
'Well, that's his problem.

1511
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:07,760
Anyway, you don't have to tell him you're
flying with us,' Tom answered.

1512
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,679
'He'll kill me if he finds out,' Francesca
murmured.

1513
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,350
'Rubbish,' Tom answered.

1514
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:18,969
'Anyway, I'm not going to let you run off
to Switzerland.

1515
01:39:18,969 --> 01:39:20,390
Make a fresh start!

1516
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:23,260
I absolutely insist.

1517
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:30,570
When are you free next?'

1518
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:31,570
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1519
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:34,120
A gentle touch

1520
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:42,989
That night, lying there in the darkness, Francesca
replayed her meeting with Tom over and over

1521
01:39:42,989 --> 01:39:44,179
in her mind.

1522
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:50,950
It was amazing to her how quickly and dramatically
her mood could change.

1523
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:57,160
All the previous week she'd been down in the
deepest depths of misery, her dream of becoming

1524
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,200
a pilot completely ruined.

1525
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:06,800
Then, all of a sudden, after meeting Tom in
the park, she was sailing up through the clouds,

1526
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,340
floating through the air like a bubble of
soap.

1527
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:16,300
It made her want to laugh; she actually lay
there on the pillow with a smile on her lips.

1528
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,780
Life could begin again!

1529
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,280
The dream was not dead.

1530
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:29,250
As she finally drifted closer to sleep, the
memory of Tom's face formed in her mind.

1531
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,500
She liked his big nose.

1532
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:36,510
It made her smile once again to remember the
way he kept holding it between his thumb and

1533
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:41,590
finger, as if hoping to find that it might
have reduced in size.

1534
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:42,590
***

1535
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:48,770
It was a long wait till her next free afternoon,
but the following Tuesday, she was waiting

1536
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:54,840
at her window when Tom's small red car pulled
into the Thompson's driveway.

1537
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:02,010
Telling herself not to rush and seem too eager,
she waited until she saw him climb out of

1538
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:05,240
the car and approach the front door.

1539
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:08,940
Then she ran down the stairs and opened the
door.

1540
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:14,690
'Hi,' he said cheerfully, touching his nose
as he did so.

1541
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:17,570
Francesca couldn't prevent a small laugh.

1542
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,900
Tom looked puzzled.

1543
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,350
'What's funny?' he asked.

1544
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:22,350
'Nothing.

1545
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:27,050
I'm sorry, I'm just excited,' Francesca replied.

1546
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:34,280
They stood there, looking at one another for
a moment or two, both a little embarrassed,

1547
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,500
then Tom laughed as well.

1548
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,090
'Right, we'd better go!'

1549
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:45,340
They climbed in the car and set off, still
laughing, like over-excited children.

1550
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:49,380
Soon, they were speeding towards the airfield.

1551
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:55,620
Tom proved to be a terrible driver - either
that or his nerves had got the better of him.

1552
01:41:55,620 --> 01:42:01,570
They seemed to approach traffic lights and
roundabouts at great speed, then need to brake

1553
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:02,820
very hard.

1554
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:09,550
At the same time, Tom chatted away happily,
telling Francesca all about Flying Start and

1555
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:15,680
its history, about the aircraft and about
George, the instructor who would take her

1556
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:18,850
flying that afternoon.

1557
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:21,390
Francesca could hardly take a word in.

1558
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:27,440
She was so excited, so relieved that her life
was moving forward again.

1559
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:34,030
She sat back with her head close to the open
window and let the wind blow through her hair.

1560
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:37,670
She felt as though she'd been reborn.

1561
01:42:37,670 --> 01:42:42,610
After twenty minutes they arrived at the airfield.

1562
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:48,030
When they went into the Flying Start office,
two middle-aged men were sitting at a small

1563
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:51,950
round table, examining a map.

1564
01:42:51,950 --> 01:43:00,739
Tom introduced them: Mike, another student
like herself, and John, his instructor.

1565
01:43:00,739 --> 01:43:06,781
Francesca then noticed a silver-haired man
of about sixty-five sitting on the sofa, reading

1566
01:43:06,781 --> 01:43:10,429
the newspaper and drinking coffee.

1567
01:43:10,429 --> 01:43:16,199
For a second or two, Francesca wondered what
he was doing there, but then the man got to

1568
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:19,440
his feet and stretched out his hand.

1569
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,890
'Something tells me you must be Francesca,'
he said.

1570
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:26,060
'My name's George Scott.

1571
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:29,140
I believe we're going flying together.'

1572
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:35,929
The moment she shook his hand, Francesca felt
herself relax.

1573
01:43:35,929 --> 01:43:40,580
'If you're Italian, you must like coffee,'
he said.

1574
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:48,550
'I love coffee,' Francesca replied, a little
puzzled by the man's remark.

1575
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:50,929
George's eyes twinkled with amusement.

1576
01:43:50,929 --> 01:43:57,679
'In that case,' he went on, looking down at
the cup he was holding, 'don't drink any of

1577
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:01,050
this stuff - unless you've got a death wish,
that is.'

1578
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:02,050
***

1579
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:09,820
Half an hour later, after doing all the usual
checks, Francesca watched from the left-hand

1580
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:18,560
seat of the Flying Start Cessna 152, as George
climbed painfully into the plane.

1581
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,460
'I'm getting too old for this,' George said.

1582
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:28,489
'You know the worst thing about flying a light
aircraft?' he went on, pulling himself up

1583
01:44:28,489 --> 01:44:30,820
and round into the seat.

1584
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:33,840
'No,' Francesca answered.

1585
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:38,890
'It's getting inside the bloody plane,' George
went on.

1586
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:45,910
He finally managed to drag his second leg
inside the door, then spent another exhausting

1587
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:48,820
minute putting on his safety harness.

1588
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:53,370
Once that was done, he turned to Francesca.

1589
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:56,020
'Right, take her away, Ms Bartolli.

1590
01:44:56,020 --> 01:45:00,130
Wake me when we get to 1000 feet.'

1591
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:04,870
Francesca laughed, but George was almost true
to his word.

1592
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:11,340
For the next fifteen minutes, Francesca was
totally in control and George sat beside her

1593
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:14,490
without saying a thing.

1594
01:45:14,490 --> 01:45:19,660
She took the plane round to the waiting point
before the start of the runway, performed

1595
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:25,210
all the aircraft checks, then called to the
control tower to line up on the runway.

1596
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:33,989
With a wave of his hand, George then indicated
that she should pull forward onto the runway.

1597
01:45:33,989 --> 01:45:38,890
Once the control tower had cleared her for
take-off, Francesca turned to him.

1598
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:41,020
'Shall I take off?'

1599
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,450
she asked.

1600
01:45:42,450 --> 01:45:47,180
'Can't think of another way to get to 1000
feet, can you?'

1601
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:52,600
George replied, his eyes twinkling with good
humour again.

1602
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:56,770
Francesca laughed, and pushed in the throttle.

1603
01:45:56,770 --> 01:46:02,410
The little plane seemed to sit up suddenly,
then pulled itself down the runway, gathering

1604
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:04,080
speed all the time.

1605
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:11,610
Checking the airspeed dial, Francesca watched
as the needle reached 60, then she pulled

1606
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,880
back gently on the control column.

1607
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:21,220
Out of the corner of her eye, she was aware
of George sitting up more alertly, his hands

1608
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:27,239
loose on his knees, ready if necessary to
reach out to the controls.

1609
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:31,070
They climbed steadily to height.

1610
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:37,719
When Francesca glanced across, she saw George
searching the sky around them, checking for

1611
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:38,770
danger.

1612
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:44,580
She realised now that his casual act was exactly
that.

1613
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:48,510
Every moment they'd been in the air he'd been
ready to take control.

1614
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:52,420
It comforted her tremendously.

1615
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:57,489
While he left her to fly the plane, she felt
confident that he would react quickly the

1616
01:46:57,489 --> 01:46:59,530
moment there was a problem.

1617
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:03,050
'Very nice,' he said at last.

1618
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:05,360
'You've got a very gentle touch.

1619
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:09,270
Now, do you fancy having another go at landing?

1620
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:14,679
I think you said that was the point you reached
at Fastwings.'

1621
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:15,679
Francesca nodded.

1622
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:20,500
'OK,' she answered, trying to sound positive.

1623
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:24,950
They flew back along the side of the airfield.

1624
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:30,860
A minute later, Francesca looked over her
shoulder and saw the end of the runway about

1625
01:47:30,860 --> 01:47:32,949
forty-five degrees behind.

1626
01:47:32,949 --> 01:47:40,130
Careful not to lose any height, she turned
the plane through ninety degrees, then reduced

1627
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:42,110
the power a little.

1628
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,240
Slowly, they began to lose height.

1629
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:51,450
Half a minute later, with the end of the runway
almost directly opposite the left-hand window,

1630
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:57,239
she turned again so the runway was directly
ahead.

1631
01:47:57,239 --> 01:48:03,590
With her hand on the throttle, Francesca let
the plane slip slowly down through the air.

1632
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:08,290
It was like being on a very gentle children's
slide.

1633
01:48:08,290 --> 01:48:13,360
Beside her, Francesca could see George sitting
relaxed.

1634
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:17,260
The runway seemed to rise up to meet them.

1635
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:22,730
She tried to picture the moment to pull back
on the control column, the rush as the ground

1636
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:24,760
seemed to swallow them up.

1637
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:28,070
'Wait...' she murmured to herself, 'Wait...'

1638
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:34,720
All of a sudden the runway seemed to open
out as if it were a sheet being unfolded in

1639
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,410
front of her.

1640
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:38,949
She pulled back and held steady.

1641
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:41,010
'Now, hold on!'

1642
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:43,270
she said under her breath.

1643
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:49,950
The plane sank gently down, then a moment
later there was a small bump as the main wheels

1644
01:48:49,950 --> 01:48:52,230
met the ground.

1645
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:58,870
Carefully, she pushed the control column forward
to bring the nose wheel down and they rolled

1646
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:01,380
along the runway.

1647
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:07,449
As they did so, Francesca felt the blood begin
flowing back to her fingers.

1648
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:11,060
She hadn't realised she had been so tense.

1649
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:17,440
'That, Ms Bartolli,' George said, looking
across at her, 'was a landing I would have

1650
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,600
been proud of myself.'

1651
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,630
He stretched out his hand.

1652
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:27,260
Smiling with delight, Francesca shook it.

1653
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:30,020
Tom was waiting when they pulled up outside
the hangar.

1654
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:36,239
'How did it go?' he asked anxiously, as they
climbed out of the plane.

1655
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:41,130
'Bloody awful,' George answered, his eyes
twinkling once more.

1656
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:44,260
'Don't know where to start.'

1657
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,260
'Really?'

1658
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:48,699
Tom said, his face screwing up.

1659
01:49:48,699 --> 01:49:50,239
Francesca went up to him.

1660
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,920
'It was wonderful,' she said.

1661
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,070
'Thank you, Tom,' she added.

1662
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:07,909
'I'm so very glad you spotted me that afternoon
in the park.'

1663
01:50:07,909 --> 01:50:09,760
CHAPTER TWELVE

1664
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,870
Alone at last

1665
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:18,659
That night Francesca had to babysit, but the
following evening Tom picked her up at seven

1666
01:50:18,659 --> 01:50:22,920
thirty and they headed out to the cinema.

1667
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:28,710
Tom was very gentlemanly, hurrying to open
the car door for her, insisting on paying

1668
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:32,670
for the tickets, and buying popcorn.

1669
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:34,199
Francesca loved it.

1670
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:40,670
Her old boyfriend, Andrea, had always said
such old-fashioned manners were 'uncool',

1671
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:44,739
but Francesca enjoyed Tom's attention.

1672
01:50:44,739 --> 01:50:51,460
She felt very special, and it made her feel
attractive; she realised now how much Andrea

1673
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:55,100
had taken her for granted.

1674
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,550
Francesca loved the film.

1675
01:50:56,550 --> 01:51:02,280
Amelia Earhart had been one of her childhood
heroes and she was an interesting character

1676
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:06,140
in herself, quite apart from her flying achievements.

1677
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:14,390
As they left the cinema, Francesca felt so
happy she reached out and took Tom's hand.

1678
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:16,320
Squeezing it excitedly, she said,

1679
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:20,989
'Come on, let's go and get a drink.'

1680
01:51:20,989 --> 01:51:27,120
Tom's reaction to the gesture was one of almost
complete astonishment, but he certainly didn't

1681
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:29,410
protest.

1682
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:34,600
Francesca was almost as astonished as Tom
at what she'd done - all the emotions of the

1683
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,810
last week had left her head spinning.

1684
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:44,170
When they'd found a pub and settled in a quiet
corner, they chatted about the film for a

1685
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:45,570
time.

1686
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:51,850
Then Francesca said, 'Do you know, my last
boyfriend would never have taken me to a film

1687
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:52,920
like that.'

1688
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:55,510
'Why ever not?'

1689
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:56,510
Tom asked.

1690
01:51:56,510 --> 01:52:02,840
'He could never understand why I loved planes
so much,' Francesca answered.

1691
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,179
'He seemed to find it embarrassing.

1692
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:12,020
I think he believed a girl who liked aircraft
must be strange in the head.

1693
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:17,400
He hated it whenever I said I wanted to become
a pilot.'

1694
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,949
Tom shook his head.

1695
01:52:18,949 --> 01:52:21,630
'That's crazy,' he said.

1696
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:25,989
'I think it's a brilliant idea.'

1697
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:30,400
Francesca nodded, delighted to find someone
who thought as she did.

1698
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:35,150
'Anyway,' she went on, 'I want to know more
about you.

1699
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:39,020
You've hardly told me a thing about yourself.'

1700
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,560
Tom gave a weak smile.

1701
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:44,290
'What do you want to know?' he asked.

1702
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:49,080
'Well, what are you interested in for a start?'

1703
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:51,220
Francesca replied.

1704
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,130
Tom hesitated.

1705
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:57,450
'Well, painting and drawing, above all.

1706
01:52:57,450 --> 01:53:00,810
Like I said before, mostly anything that flies.'

1707
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:05,679
'Would you show me your pictures some time?'

1708
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:07,230
Tom looked uncomfortable.

1709
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:09,400
'They're nothing special.

1710
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:15,199
"Traditional and unimaginative" was how they've
been described,' he said.

1711
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,719
'What do you mean?'

1712
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:18,739
Francesca asked.

1713
01:53:18,739 --> 01:53:25,710
'I went to art college after I left school,'
Tom replied, then went on quite bitterly.

1714
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:31,610
'They didn't much like the sort of thing I
do and I didn't like their ideas, so we had

1715
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:33,110
a bit of an argument.

1716
01:53:33,110 --> 01:53:35,610
I left after a couple of terms.'

1717
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:40,330
'That sounds like a true artist,' Francesca
replied.

1718
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:42,260
'Good for you!'

1719
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:44,190
Tom looked surprised.

1720
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:47,930
'That's not what my father said,' Tom added.

1721
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:49,909
'He called it "dropping out".'

1722
01:53:49,909 --> 01:53:58,010
'Well, if that bird you drew is anything to
go by, it was the art college that lost out.'

1723
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:02,140
'That's not quite how my father sees it,'
Tom muttered.

1724
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:07,520
'I've never been quite the son he wanted,
I guess.'

1725
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:13,040
Sensing it was a bit of a delicate area, Francesca
asked him about other things and soon the

1726
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,630
subject was forgotten.

1727
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:17,320
Tom relaxed again.

1728
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:23,260
Three-quarters of an hour passed before they
knew it; all of a sudden the pub was closing.

1729
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:31,980
They drove back to the Thompsons, both curiously
silent, a little uncertain of what lay ahead.

1730
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:35,910
When they reached the house, Tom pulled up
beside the pavement.

1731
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:40,220
With the engine still running, he turned towards
Francesca.

1732
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:43,710
'Thank you for a wonderful evening,' he said.

1733
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,870
'I've enjoyed it so much.'

1734
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:50,179
'No, Tom, I've got to thank you,' Francesca
replied.

1735
01:54:50,179 --> 01:54:53,699
'It was really lovely.'

1736
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:57,070
They looked at each other a bit awkwardly.

1737
01:54:57,070 --> 01:54:59,370
After a moment Tom spoke again.

1738
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:03,050
'So, I'll see you up at the airfield next
Tuesday?'

1739
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:05,960
'You bet,' Francesca replied.

1740
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:09,610
The awkwardness grew again.

1741
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:13,239
This time Francesca reached out her hand.

1742
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:17,170
'Tom,' she said, touching him on the arm.

1743
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:22,679
'I didn't thank you properly yesterday afternoon
for persuading me to join Flying Start.'

1744
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:26,620
'Of course, you did,' Tom protested.

1745
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:29,760
'No, Tom, really,' Francesca insisted.

1746
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,110
'Three days ago I was more depressed than
I can tell you.

1747
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:40,250
I was about to go back to Switzerland and
drop the whole idea of flying, a dream I've

1748
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:43,010
had since I was just a child.

1749
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:45,940
And then meeting you in the park...

1750
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:51,489
well, you rescued me, don't you understand?'

1751
01:55:51,489 --> 01:55:54,050
Tom blinked in confusion.

1752
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:56,820
'Really?' he asked.

1753
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:00,540
'Really,' Francesca replied.

1754
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:05,790
With that, she leant across the car very quickly
and kissed Tom on the cheek.

1755
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:11,850
'Thank you,' she said, then climbed hurriedly
out of the car.

1756
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:17,090
Later that night, she lay in bed thinking
over her evening with Tom.

1757
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:23,560
It occurred to her that kissing him like that
wasn't exactly the act of someone determined

1758
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,030
to avoid a relationship, but she didn't really
care.

1759
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:33,200
There was something about his shyness that
she liked and the way he seemed so proud to

1760
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,300
be with her.

1761
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:40,420
When she'd got out of the car after the kiss,
he'd looked as wide-eyed as a young boy with

1762
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:42,469
a brilliant birthday gift.

1763
01:56:42,469 --> 01:56:49,960
The memory left her with a smile as she drifted
off to sleep.

1764
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:50,960
***

1765
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,210
Francesca didn't have any time off in the
next few days, so she didn't see Tom again

1766
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:56,989
until the next Tuesday afternoon.

1767
01:56:56,989 --> 01:57:01,640
Of course, they phoned and texted one another
a number of times.

1768
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:07,090
When she arrived at the airfield, however,
George was keen to get going quickly, so there

1769
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:10,300
was no time to talk.

1770
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:15,670
Once Francesca had checked the aircraft, she
climbed inside and started up the engine.

1771
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:23,020
A couple of minutes later, George pulled himself
slowly into the right-hand seat.

1772
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:26,610
'OK,' he said, once they were settled.

1773
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:31,820
'Today I want three more landings exactly
like the one you did last Thursday.

1774
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:34,940
Do you think you can manage that?'

1775
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:40,600
They approached the runway, then waited for
another plane to land.

1776
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:49,000
As it got nearer, Francesca recognised the
Fastwings Cessna and her heart missed a beat.

1777
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:55,500
Although she knew Doug couldn't possibly see
her, she felt herself slide lower in the seat

1778
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:58,030
as he flew past.

1779
01:57:58,030 --> 01:58:02,400
When his plane had cleared the runway, they
moved forward themselves and quickly took

1780
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,400
off.

1781
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:10,250
A couple of minutes later they were at 1000
feet and turning round on the familiar route

1782
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:14,260
to land back at the airfield.

1783
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:20,070
Francesca's first landing was good - not as
good as the one on Thursday, but in Georges

1784
01:58:20,070 --> 01:58:22,760
words, 'quite acceptable'.

1785
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,980
The second was brilliant.

1786
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:31,120
As she brought the plane down, she knew even
before the wheels touched the ground, that

1787
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:36,400
they would just kiss the runway as softly
as a pair of lips.

1788
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,650
George was impressed.

1789
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:40,330
'Very good,' he said.

1790
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:44,920
'Now, pull up just there on the left.'

1791
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:48,150
Francesca frowned, but did as George instructed.

1792
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:49,860
She felt a little disappointed.

1793
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:56,640
'I thought you said we were going to do three
landings,' she said, bringing the plane to

1794
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,640
a stop.

1795
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:00,150
'I'm not,' George replied.

1796
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:03,720
'But you are.'

1797
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:07,719
George was already opening the door before
she'd understood what he meant.

1798
01:59:07,719 --> 01:59:10,699
'You mean I'm going on my own?'

1799
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:11,730
she said.

1800
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:16,060
'We call it "going solo",' George answered.

1801
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:17,699
'Now listen.

1802
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:22,600
Just take the aircraft round to the start
of the runway, radio the control tower for

1803
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,840
permission to take off, and take her up.

1804
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:28,950
Do exactly what you've just done.

1805
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:32,160
Just one landing, then bring her back to the
hangar.

1806
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:34,780
All right?'

1807
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,700
Francesca was too taken aback to protest.

1808
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:40,050
She nodded silently.

1809
01:59:40,050 --> 01:59:43,140
George was already climbing out of the plane.

1810
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,390
She couldn't believe what was happening.

1811
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:52,620
She'd imagined that flying solo would be months
ahead, after dozens and dozens of landings.

1812
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:58,719
'You'll find she'll climb much quicker with
only one person,' George said, already standing

1813
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:00,870
down on the ground.

1814
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:02,670
Again, Francesca nodded.

1815
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:06,429
'Away you go then,' George said.

1816
02:00:06,429 --> 02:00:10,780
He gave an encouraging thumbs-up sign, then
shut the door.

1817
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:17,280
The next moment he was moving away below the
wing, and heading for the grass.

1818
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:21,550
All of a sudden, Francesca found herself on
her own.

1819
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:24,679
She blinked a couple of times, trying to focus.

1820
02:00:24,679 --> 02:00:29,989
The cockpit seemed terribly empty without
George close at her side.

1821
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:31,010
She hesitated.

1822
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:34,800
'Well, this is what you wanted, isn't it?'

1823
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,750
she thought, suddenly angry with herself.

1824
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:44,650
With that, she sat up, reached for the throttle
and released the brakes.

1825
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:46,650
The plane edged forward.

1826
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:53,090
Through the side window she saw George making
his way across the grass; he didn't turn and

1827
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:55,020
wave.

1828
02:00:55,020 --> 02:01:00,200
Francesca took the plane up to the waiting
point before the runway and stopped.

1829
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:03,370
Clearing her throat, she called the control
tower.

1830
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:10,120
'Golf Lima Yankee is ready for take-off,'
she said, surprised at the firmness of her

1831
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,860
voice.

1832
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:17,590
'Golf Lima Yankee, you are cleared for take-off,'
came the reply.

1833
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:22,590
Francesca steered the plane round onto the
piano keys and stopped again, the runway stretching

1834
02:01:22,590 --> 02:01:23,590
ahead.

1835
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:26,140
'This is it,' she thought.

1836
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:30,620
'This is the last chance to turn back.'

1837
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:34,380
She only hesitated to check all the dials
and controls.

1838
02:01:34,380 --> 02:01:40,530
Then, emptying her mind of all other thoughts,
she pushed in the throttle.

1839
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:44,070
The plane sat up eagerly and moved forward.

1840
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:47,370
This time the speed picked up much faster.

1841
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:52,900
Soon they were at 55, and then before she
knew it the nose was lifting up and they were

1842
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:53,900
in the air.

1843
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:58,320
'Keep the nose down,' she kept telling herself.

1844
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:02,290
'Don't try to climb too fast!'

1845
02:02:02,290 --> 02:02:04,760
George was absolutely right.

1846
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:10,600
Without his extra weight, the plane was up
to 1000 feet in half the time it had previously

1847
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,930
taken.

1848
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:15,040
Steadily, Francesca turned the aircraft.

1849
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,870
As she did so, a wonderful feeling ran through
her.

1850
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:22,260
This was it!

1851
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:24,409
She was solo!

1852
02:02:24,409 --> 02:02:29,130
All those hours of work and saving had finally
paid off.

1853
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:36,170
A smile began to creep across her face; but
the moment she felt it, she wiped it away.

1854
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:40,409
'Francesca,' she said, 'you are up here all
alone.

1855
02:02:40,409 --> 02:02:45,210
Now you've got to get down by yourself.'

1856
02:02:45,210 --> 02:02:48,140
She had to concentrate very hard.

1857
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:51,080
Everything happened twice as fast as usual.

1858
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:55,730
Before she knew it she was already making
the preparations for landing, watching for

1859
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:58,710
the moment to swing onto the final approach.

1860
02:02:58,710 --> 02:03:04,230
When she did, a new sense of confidence ran
through her.

1861
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:08,600
Slowly the plane slipped through the sky,
gradually losing height.

1862
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,670
'Remember that picture,' she told herself.

1863
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:16,800
'You're going down a slide; at the end you'll
step off.'

1864
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,560
Down and down she slid.

1865
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,620
She concentrated very hard.

1866
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:24,690
'Not too soon,' she said out loud.

1867
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:27,210
'Remember to hold off!'

1868
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:31,490
Afterwards, she couldn't remember those last
few moments.

1869
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:36,770
She must have been so focused, so concentrated
on the job.

1870
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:43,199
All she knew was that, quite suddenly, she
was down and the plane was running along the

1871
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:44,310
runway.

1872
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:50,560
As she drove the plane back towards the hangar,
a huge sense of achievement ran through her,

1873
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,350
greater than she'd ever felt before in her
life.

1874
02:03:54,350 --> 02:04:00,620
She had flown a plane solo; no one would be
able to take that from her as long as she

1875
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:01,620
lived.

1876
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:06,199
A new smile began to spread across her face.

1877
02:04:06,199 --> 02:04:09,420
This time she didn't stop it.

1878
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:17,150
Tom came running towards her before she'd
even brought the plane to a stop.

1879
02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:20,909
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1880
02:04:20,909 --> 02:04:27,690
A declaration of war

1881
02:04:27,690 --> 02:04:33,300
Francesca couldn't remember ever having been
happier than she was that evening.

1882
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:38,580
When she got home, the first thing she did
was make a Skype call to her family.

1883
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:41,790
Her mother's reaction made her laugh.

1884
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:44,310
'Oh no, Francesca!

1885
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:46,780
Please don't say that!'

1886
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,000
her mother cried.

1887
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,970
'Please don't tell me you've been up there
all alone.

1888
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:55,969
Whatever was your stupid instructor thinking
of!'

1889
02:04:55,969 --> 02:05:00,469
'But Mamma, you have to go solo some time!'

1890
02:05:00,469 --> 02:05:01,929
Francesca answered.

1891
02:05:01,929 --> 02:05:05,380
'Well, why didn't he warn you?

1892
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:08,770
Why didn't he tell you beforehand?'

1893
02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:10,230
Francesca's mother protested.

1894
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:14,000
'Oh, Mamma, think about it!'

1895
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Francesca replied.

1896
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,110
'If your instructor warned you in advance,
it would be disastrous.

1897
02:05:20,110 --> 02:05:23,900
Can you imagine how nervous you'd get?'

1898
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:29,020
'Well, please don't do it again, that's all,'
her mother said.

1899
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:33,500
'But of course I will, Mamma,' Francesca answered.

1900
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:37,840
'That's the whole point!'

1901
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:43,550
When Francesca finally returned downstairs,
the Thompsons produced a bottle of champagne

1902
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:45,190
to celebrate.

1903
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:50,800
Francesca had an extraordinary sensation at
that moment - as though she was walking on

1904
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,280
air.

1905
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:57,210
If someone had asked her, she half imagined
she might be able to fly herself.

1906
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:03,889
That evening Tom came round and took her out
for a meal to celebrate.

1907
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:08,429
This time Francesca insisted on sharing the
cost.

1908
02:06:08,429 --> 02:06:14,080
The restaurant - Italian, of course - was
beside the river, and they sat outside in

1909
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:18,480
the evening sunshine, overlooking the water.

1910
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:22,889
When the meal was finished, they went for
a walk along the river bank until they came

1911
02:06:22,889 --> 02:06:23,920
to a bench.

1912
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:30,580
They sat there for a time, chatting quietly,
all the time watching a couple of white swans

1913
02:06:30,580 --> 02:06:36,800
in the water in front of them, the birds circling
elegantly in the water, as if admiring one

1914
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,300
another.

1915
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:43,489
Francesca couldn't think of a more perfect
English setting.

1916
02:06:43,489 --> 02:06:48,880
Sunshine sparkled on the water, setting a
million diamonds dancing on the surface of

1917
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,300
the river.

1918
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:56,430
When Tom drove her home, they sat in the car
for a long time, with the engine running.

1919
02:06:56,430 --> 02:07:02,880
At last, with her heart bursting with all
the magic of the day, Francesca could stop

1920
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,590
herself no longer.

1921
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:12,179
'Tom,' she said suddenly, 'you know, if you
don't kiss me, I'm going to be very upset.'

1922
02:07:12,179 --> 02:07:15,469
Tom looked at her in astonishment.

1923
02:07:15,469 --> 02:07:22,239
Then, very slowly, not quite believing his
luck, he leant across and softly kissed her

1924
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:23,449
on the lips.

1925
02:07:23,449 --> 02:07:30,280
They broke apart, looking at one another as
if seeing each other properly for the first

1926
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:34,340
time, then kissed again.

1927
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:37,800
After a minute or two like this, Tom pulled
away.

1928
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:44,100
'I can't believe this is happening,' he said
quietly.

1929
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:46,130
Francesca looked at with him amusement.

1930
02:07:46,130 --> 02:07:50,980
'You'd better kiss me again in that case,'
she said.

1931
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:51,980
***

1932
02:07:51,980 --> 02:07:58,510
It was about ten o'clock the following morning
when Francesca's mobile rang.

1933
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:04,540
Since she was expecting a call from Tom, she
didn't even bother to glance at the screen.

1934
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:07,070
'Hello,' she said happily.

1935
02:08:07,070 --> 02:08:09,929
'Why did you lie to me?'

1936
02:08:09,929 --> 02:08:13,639
a man's voice asked roughly.

1937
02:08:13,639 --> 02:08:18,560
Francesca was so shocked, that for a second
or two, she didn't realise who it was.

1938
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,630
Then she felt her stomach drop.

1939
02:08:21,630 --> 02:08:28,650
'I asked you why you lied to me,' Doug repeated
even more brutally.

1940
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:34,330
'Why couldn't you find the courage to tell
me what you were planning?'

1941
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:38,010
Francesca was still too astonished to react
sensibly.

1942
02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:42,010
She suddenly felt a terrible sense of disappointment.

1943
02:08:42,010 --> 02:08:45,739
Had everything that previous day been just
a dream?

1944
02:08:45,739 --> 02:08:49,130
All her happiness had been swept away in a
flash.

1945
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:52,240
'I asked you a question!'

1946
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,100
Doug was almost shouting.

1947
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:58,699
'I don't know what you mean,' Francesca managed
to say at last.

1948
02:08:58,699 --> 02:08:59,699
'I-'

1949
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:01,320
Doug cut her short.

1950
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:04,430
'Don't play that game with me,' he growled.

1951
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:06,290
'Do you think I'm stupid?

1952
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:10,250
I know very well you've joined Flying Start.

1953
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:14,630
I heard you on the radio yesterday making
your calls to the control tower.

1954
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:18,139
Did you really imagine I wouldn't find out?

1955
02:09:18,139 --> 02:09:21,020
What was it - first solo?'

1956
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:25,189
Doug sounded almost mad.

1957
02:09:25,189 --> 02:09:30,190
Francesca still couldn't quite believe what
she was hearing, but the man was just getting

1958
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:31,280
started.

1959
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,690
'You tricked me!' he went on bitterly.

1960
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:39,600
'You told me you were going back to Switzerland
just so you could get your money back.

1961
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:45,960
And all the time you were planning to switch
to that useless lot at Flying Start.'

1962
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:47,620
'I wasn't!'

1963
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,620
Francesca broke in.

1964
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:52,540
'I don't believe you,' Doug answered.

1965
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,820
'It's true,' Francesca protested.

1966
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:56,489
'I was going home.

1967
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:58,401
I only changed my mind because...'

1968
02:09:58,401 --> 02:10:00,630
'Because what?'

1969
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:01,690
Doug said bitterly.

1970
02:10:01,690 --> 02:10:06,370
'I trust you're not going to give me any of
that rubbish about touching you up.'

1971
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:11,510
'It wasn't rubbish,' Francesca said, starting
to fight back.

1972
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:13,010
'Oh yes?

1973
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:18,470
Perhaps you'd like to prove it then,' Doug
said, almost spitting out the words.

1974
02:10:18,470 --> 02:10:21,560
'But it's the truth!'

1975
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,310
Francesca responded.

1976
02:10:23,310 --> 02:10:28,219
She was suddenly filled with panic, thinking
of that other woman's experience when she'd

1977
02:10:28,219 --> 02:10:30,460
made accusations against Doug.

1978
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:33,199
'You know it's the truth!'

1979
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,929
she went on more desperately.

1980
02:10:34,929 --> 02:10:41,550
'Right from the very first day you were making
horrible remarks and asking me about my boyfriend,

1981
02:10:41,550 --> 02:10:46,150
then trying to scare me so you could put your
horrible hands all over me.

1982
02:10:46,150 --> 02:10:50,550
Just because I'm young and foreign it doesn't
mean you can do as you please.

1983
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:54,650
Did you really imagine that I might be interested
in you?

1984
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:56,949
I think you're disgusting.

1985
02:10:56,949 --> 02:11:01,480
If you were the last man on earth, I wouldn't
look at you twice!'

1986
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:07,020
Doug didn't respond for a moment, then he
burst out suddenly.

1987
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:10,630
'How dare you!' he shouted.

1988
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:13,390
'You're going to regret what you just said!

1989
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:16,340
Do you hear me?'

1990
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:18,250
Francesca was shocked into silence.

1991
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:22,100
'I said, "Do you hear me?"'

1992
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:25,070
Doug repeated.

1993
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:26,929
Francesca didn't know what to say.

1994
02:11:26,929 --> 02:11:30,080
Finally, it was all too much.

1995
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:36,620
A rush of Italian spilled from her mouth - words
she didn't normally use - then she ended the

1996
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,970
call.

1997
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:42,930
With that she collapsed down onto the chair
beside her.

1998
02:11:42,930 --> 02:11:49,730
For some time afterwards she stared at the
phone, not believing what had just happened.

1999
02:11:49,730 --> 02:11:54,400
Her heart was beating very fast and her hand
was shaking.

2000
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,580
She couldn't seem to get her breath.

2001
02:11:56,580 --> 02:12:01,989
Then a dreadful feeling began to sweep over
her.

2002
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:07,980
Something terrible had just taken place, something
that couldn't be reversed.

2003
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:12,909
What had happened was like a declaration of
war.

2004
02:12:12,909 --> 02:12:17,040
From now on she wouldn't be able to relax
for a minute.

2005
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:18,670
Doug was a madman.

2006
02:12:18,670 --> 02:12:28,420
There was no telling what he might do next.

2007
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,420
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

2008
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:34,860
Learning a lesson

2009
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:40,510
Francesca didn't tell Tom - or anyone else,
for that matter - about Doug's phone call.

2010
02:12:40,510 --> 02:12:44,320
She didn't want to talk about it, or even
think about it.

2011
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:50,010
In that way she could try and pretend it had
never happened.

2012
02:12:50,010 --> 02:12:56,429
Nevertheless, when she arrived at the airfield
for her next lesson on Thursday afternoon,

2013
02:12:56,429 --> 02:13:00,610
Tom immediately spotted there was something
wrong.

2014
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:05,350
Although she might have been able to disguise
her voice on the phone, it was more difficult

2015
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:08,530
to hide it from her appearance.

2016
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:13,350
She'd hardly slept all night and she felt
terrible.

2017
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:17,510
He jumped up the moment she came into the
office and hurried over to her.

2018
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:21,040
'Are you OK?' he asked, looking concerned.

2019
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,880
'Why, don't I look it?'

2020
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,770
Francesca answered sharply.

2021
02:13:25,770 --> 02:13:28,340
Tom seemed hurt.

2022
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:33,420
Frowning a little, he immediately said, 'You
look absolutely great.

2023
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:38,330
I'm sorry, I just thought you seemed a bit
worried when you came in, that's all.'

2024
02:13:38,330 --> 02:13:43,020
'I guess I'll have to do better then,' Francesca
answered.

2025
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:48,560
Then, doubly ashamed for treating Tom so unfairly,
she said.

2026
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:49,560
'Sorry.

2027
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:52,800
I've just had a bad morning with the children.

2028
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,510
I didn't mean to be so horrible.'

2029
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:58,310
Tom look relieved.

2030
02:13:58,310 --> 02:14:01,920
They kissed briefly, then Francesca looked
around.

2031
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,909
'Where's George?'

2032
02:14:03,909 --> 02:14:05,350
she asked.

2033
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:07,250
'He's on his way,' Tom answered.

2034
02:14:07,250 --> 02:14:11,810
'He phoned a short while ago to say he's stuck
in traffic.'

2035
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:13,190
Tom paused.

2036
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:18,480
'But I've just heard some interesting news,'
he said.

2037
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,520
'What's that?'

2038
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:23,020
Francesca asked.

2039
02:14:23,020 --> 02:14:25,660
Tom gave something of a strange look.

2040
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:32,830
'Well, I've just been talking to a guy who
keeps his aircraft in the same hangar as Doug's,'

2041
02:14:32,830 --> 02:14:33,830
he said.

2042
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:34,830
'Why?

2043
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:36,179
What's happened?'

2044
02:14:36,179 --> 02:14:37,510
Francesca asked impatiently.

2045
02:14:37,510 --> 02:14:40,230
Tom raised his eyebrows.

2046
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:48,060
'Well, according to this guy, Doug spent the
night sleeping in the Fastwings office!'

2047
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:49,340
'What!'

2048
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:50,340
Francesca said.

2049
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:53,530
'That's what the guy said,' Tom went on.

2050
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:59,239
'Apparently, when he came in this morning,
he found Doug in a sleeping bag on the sofa

2051
02:14:59,239 --> 02:15:00,640
in his office.

2052
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:08,340
It seems his wife has thrown him out and he's
sleeping there until he can make other arrangements.'

2053
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:11,880
Francesca was too shocked to speak for a moment.

2054
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:15,409
Sitting down, she tried to think it through.

2055
02:15:15,409 --> 02:15:21,350
It certainly helped to explain the madness
of the phone call she'd received from Doug.

2056
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:24,170
Perhaps he was having some kind of mental
breakdown?

2057
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,810
But how would that affect her?

2058
02:15:26,810 --> 02:15:30,639
Did it make things better or worse for her?

2059
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:36,810
'I must say I've never liked Doug very much,'
Tom went on, 'but I wouldn't wish a family

2060
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,070
break-up on anyone.

2061
02:15:39,070 --> 02:15:41,909
You met his wife and kids, didn't you?'

2062
02:15:41,909 --> 02:15:45,400
'Yes,' Francesca answered distantly.

2063
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:51,760
Then, after a moment or two, she added, 'Do
you know what it's all about?'

2064
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:52,870
Tom shook his head.

2065
02:15:52,870 --> 02:15:56,130
'No, that's all Doug told this guy.

2066
02:15:56,130 --> 02:16:02,690
I don't suppose it's the sort of thing you
want to talk about very much.'

2067
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:03,920
Francesca didn't comment.

2068
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:10,450
A picture had come into her mind: Doug having
been thrown out of his home, sitting in his

2069
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:16,699
office, on his mobile phone to her, bitter
and furious, striking out at anyone who had

2070
02:16:16,699 --> 02:16:18,440
upset him.

2071
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:23,310
She had no idea where he was when he'd phoned
her, of course, but the picture stuck in her

2072
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:24,920
mind.

2073
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:31,380
He seemed suddenly more dangerous, more unpredictable
than ever.

2074
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:36,559
She was just about to tell Tom about Doug's
phone call, when George came in.

2075
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:40,279
'You two look a bit suspicious,' he said.

2076
02:16:40,279 --> 02:16:42,119
'What's up?'

2077
02:16:42,119 --> 02:16:43,829
Tom retold the story.

2078
02:16:43,829 --> 02:16:49,869
When he'd finished, George simply said, 'Sorry,
I don't have much sympathy.

2079
02:16:49,869 --> 02:16:52,849
From what I've heard he's a bit of a womaniser.

2080
02:16:52,849 --> 02:16:55,050
No doubt his wife's had enough of him.

2081
02:16:55,050 --> 02:16:58,119
He probably deserves all he gets.'

2082
02:16:58,119 --> 02:17:00,580
He smiled at Francesca.

2083
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:03,069
'Pleased you moved to us?'

2084
02:17:03,069 --> 02:17:08,929
Francesca nodded, at the same time wondering
exactly what George meant about Doug being

2085
02:17:08,929 --> 02:17:10,189
a womaniser.

2086
02:17:10,189 --> 02:17:13,319
But there was no time to ask.

2087
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:16,760
'Right, let's get flying,' George said.

2088
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:20,849
'This afternoon you're going to fly me down
to Beccles.

2089
02:17:20,849 --> 02:17:25,689
There's a nice little grass airfield there
where you can practise some more solo landings.

2090
02:17:25,689 --> 02:17:29,550
How does that sound?'

2091
02:17:29,550 --> 02:17:34,609
Francesca found it difficult to concentrate
at first when they climbed into the Cessna.

2092
02:17:34,609 --> 02:17:38,369
Her mind was still focused on the news about
Doug.

2093
02:17:38,369 --> 02:17:44,050
Besides, as they approached the runway she
kept thinking that he might have just picked

2094
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:50,079
up her call to the control tower and would
know she was at the airfield now.

2095
02:17:50,079 --> 02:17:54,569
She tried to tell herself that it made no
difference, that there was nothing he could

2096
02:17:54,569 --> 02:17:55,569
do.

2097
02:17:55,569 --> 02:17:58,439
But she still felt very nervous.

2098
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:02,729
It wasn't until they'd taken off that she
began to relax.

2099
02:18:02,729 --> 02:18:05,449
'That's better,' George commented.

2100
02:18:05,449 --> 02:18:11,309
'I was beginning to think you were a different
person from the girl who went solo last week.'

2101
02:18:11,309 --> 02:18:18,899
They flew on over farmland: large fields of
corn, and grassy fields with cattle in.

2102
02:18:18,899 --> 02:18:25,179
The cows looked tiny, like small beetles creeping
across a green sheet.

2103
02:18:25,179 --> 02:18:32,760
Every now and again a small wood, or the grounds
of a big house, provided some contrast.

2104
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:39,479
After about twenty minutes, a small group
of hangars appeared under the nose of the

2105
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:46,729
aircraft, and then the broad line of a pale
green runway cut through the grass.

2106
02:18:46,729 --> 02:18:52,329
George announced their arrival over the radio
and told Francesca to fly round to make their

2107
02:18:52,329 --> 02:18:54,829
approach from the west.

2108
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:57,019
She did as instructed.

2109
02:18:57,019 --> 02:19:04,379
Beccles was a much smaller airfield than Norwich
and the runway looked impossibly short.

2110
02:19:04,379 --> 02:19:08,319
'Just keep your eyes on the piano keys,' George
told her.

2111
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:11,550
'And use the throttle to control the height.'

2112
02:19:11,550 --> 02:19:14,239
They came in a bit too fast.

2113
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:19,929
The plane flew on far beyond the piano keys
and landed with a heavy bump.

2114
02:19:19,929 --> 02:19:25,489
But the aircraft quickly slowed to a stop
on the grass runway.

2115
02:19:25,489 --> 02:19:29,229
George told her to take the plane over to
a small group of hangars.

2116
02:19:29,229 --> 02:19:33,609
When they'd stopped, George turned to her.

2117
02:19:33,609 --> 02:19:38,279
'Right, I'm going to have a cup of tea with
my friend, Stan, in the office here.

2118
02:19:38,279 --> 02:19:43,269
And while I'm doing that, I want you to do
three landings.

2119
02:19:43,269 --> 02:19:48,159
When you've finished, don't forget to come
and pick me up.'

2120
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:54,829
After George had climbed out and hurried off,
Francesca tried to refocus her thoughts.

2121
02:19:54,829 --> 02:20:00,069
She felt more worried this time, much more
so than when George had sent her off on her

2122
02:20:00,069 --> 02:20:02,510
first solo.

2123
02:20:02,510 --> 02:20:07,109
She wondered whether he would have been happy
for her to fly if he knew all the things that

2124
02:20:07,109 --> 02:20:09,140
were occupying her mind.

2125
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:17,209
Perhaps she should have told him, confessed
that she hadn't really slept.

2126
02:20:17,209 --> 02:20:21,489
Francesca went back to the start of the runway
and a minute later she was speeding over the

2127
02:20:21,489 --> 02:20:28,489
grass and pulling back gently on the control
column, up in the air once more.

2128
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:34,600
Almost immediately, as she began climbing
to height, she felt her brain begin to clear.

2129
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:41,439
It was as if a screen in her head was being
wiped clean; suddenly all her fears and concerns

2130
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:43,890
about Doug disappeared.

2131
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:49,129
There was only Francesca and her plane.

2132
02:20:49,129 --> 02:20:53,760
She flew round in a tight circle, glancing
happily down at the hangars where she'd just

2133
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,550
left George, then concentrated on turning
for the landing run.

2134
02:20:58,550 --> 02:21:04,340
With each landing, her technique improved
and her confidence grew.

2135
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:09,829
After the third landing, she took the plane
over to where George was already waiting on

2136
02:21:09,829 --> 02:21:10,829
the grass.

2137
02:21:10,829 --> 02:21:15,279
'Well done,' he said simply, as he climbed
into the plane.

2138
02:21:15,279 --> 02:21:17,249
'Now, take me home, please.

2139
02:21:17,249 --> 02:21:19,199
It's beginning to get cold.'

2140
02:21:19,199 --> 02:21:25,550
What George had said was true: it was beginning
to feel colder.

2141
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:30,079
The wind was picking up slightly and there
was a chill in the air.

2142
02:21:30,079 --> 02:21:32,069
Francesca shivered suddenly.

2143
02:21:32,069 --> 02:21:35,859
They took off and began climbing to height.

2144
02:21:35,859 --> 02:21:42,260
Then, when they'd reached about 500 feet,
George slowly stretched forward and pulled

2145
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:44,479
out the throttle.

2146
02:21:44,479 --> 02:21:48,640
'You have engine failure,' he said.

2147
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:52,529
For a moment or two Francesca didn't know
what was happening.

2148
02:21:52,529 --> 02:21:56,819
The power died instantly, and with it, all
the speed.

2149
02:21:56,819 --> 02:22:01,540
An unnatural silence filled the cabin.

2150
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:04,420
Francesca felt panic flood through her body.

2151
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:09,510
The next second the stall-warning alarm sounded.

2152
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:14,810
At the last moment, just as George was about
to take over, Francesca reacted.

2153
02:22:14,810 --> 02:22:19,159
She pushed the control column forward and
dropped the nose.

2154
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:24,830
Almost immediately, the stall-warning alarm
fell silent, the speed picked up again and

2155
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:28,560
the frightening sense that they were about
to drop out of the sky died.

2156
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,989
But still there was no power.

2157
02:22:30,989 --> 02:22:34,130
'Where are you going to land?'

2158
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:36,060
George asked calmly.

2159
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:38,260
'The airfield?'

2160
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:39,699
Francesca replied.

2161
02:22:39,699 --> 02:22:42,189
'No,' George said firmly.

2162
02:22:42,189 --> 02:22:46,640
'Never try to turn back!'

2163
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:50,880
Francesca searched the horizon ahead for an
open field.

2164
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:55,869
Some way in front, beside some trees, there
was a long green field.

2165
02:22:55,869 --> 02:22:58,209
'That one over there, then!'

2166
02:22:58,209 --> 02:22:59,209
she shouted.

2167
02:22:59,209 --> 02:23:00,340
'Which one?'

2168
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:01,710
George asked.

2169
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:04,330
'The one on the right!'

2170
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:07,470
They continued slipping down.

2171
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:15,239
350 feet, 300; all of a sudden they were down
to 200.

2172
02:23:15,239 --> 02:23:18,169
At last George reached for the throttle.

2173
02:23:18,169 --> 02:23:23,479
The power recovered at once and the speed
picked up.

2174
02:23:23,479 --> 02:23:29,149
Francesca pulled back on the control column
in relief, her blood flowing freely once again.

2175
02:23:29,149 --> 02:23:34,499
When they'd regained some height, George looked
across at her.

2176
02:23:34,499 --> 02:23:41,140
'I thought you'd done an "engine-failure-on-take-off"
when you were with Fastwings?'

2177
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:44,050
'No,' Francesca answered.

2178
02:23:44,050 --> 02:23:46,350
George shook his head in disgust.

2179
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:48,619
'That man Barker is worse than I thought.

2180
02:23:48,619 --> 02:23:55,430
Well, let it be a lesson to you,' he went
on, more seriously than she'd ever heard him

2181
02:23:55,430 --> 02:23:56,430
before.

2182
02:23:56,430 --> 02:24:01,020
'An engine can fail at any time, especially
during take-off.

2183
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:03,529
If it fails, you've got to act quickly.

2184
02:24:03,529 --> 02:24:06,539
Drop the nose and look for somewhere to land.

2185
02:24:06,539 --> 02:24:08,590
And keep up your speed.

2186
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:19,680
If you don't, we won't need to bury you - you'll
make your own hole in the ground.'

2187
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,569
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

2188
02:24:21,569 --> 02:24:22,770
Nowhere to hide

2189
02:24:22,770 --> 02:24:30,840
The following week, at about ten o'clock in
the morning, Francesca was returning to the

2190
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:34,689
house after taking the children to school.

2191
02:24:34,689 --> 02:24:40,840
She was nearly home when she noticed the grey
Audi on the other side of Brabazon Road.

2192
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:47,329
It was just one of many other cars, but Francesca
immediately thought of Doug's.

2193
02:24:47,329 --> 02:24:53,449
His was a grey Audi, she was certain, but
was it the same model?

2194
02:24:53,449 --> 02:24:57,950
She felt her whole body tense up and tried
not to look.

2195
02:24:57,950 --> 02:25:03,949
As she turned into the drive of the Thompsons'
house, she couldn't stop herself glancing

2196
02:25:03,949 --> 02:25:05,449
across at the car.

2197
02:25:05,449 --> 02:25:09,489
Was there someone sitting in the driving seat?

2198
02:25:09,489 --> 02:25:14,810
The sun was reflecting on the glass and it
wasn't easy to see inside.

2199
02:25:14,810 --> 02:25:16,970
She looked at the number plate.

2200
02:25:16,970 --> 02:25:24,279
She only dared look for half a second, and
she could only take in the first three letters.

2201
02:25:24,279 --> 02:25:29,939
With a horrible feeling growing in her throat,
Francesca let herself into the house and hurried

2202
02:25:29,939 --> 02:25:33,180
upstairs to her room.

2203
02:25:33,180 --> 02:25:37,840
Keeping back in the shadow, she slowly approached
the window and looked out.

2204
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:44,890
The car was still there, half-visible behind
a tree, like a wolf hiding in the wood, a

2205
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:49,079
grey creature creeping about, ready to leap.

2206
02:25:49,079 --> 02:25:54,149
She watched for at least a minute, unconsciously
holding her breath.

2207
02:25:54,149 --> 02:25:58,520
Then the car suddenly pulled away and raced
off up the road.

2208
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:05,129
For the rest of the day Francesca couldn't
get the memory of the car out of her head.

2209
02:26:05,129 --> 02:26:07,590
She couldn't be sure it was Doug's.

2210
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:14,399
On one hand, she knew very well that plenty
of people drove grey Audis, but on the other

2211
02:26:14,399 --> 02:26:21,560
hand it seemed too much of a coincidence that
a car just like Doug's should be parked opposite

2212
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:22,560
her house.

2213
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:27,210
But if it was him, what on earth was he doing?

2214
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:32,289
The idea that he might be following her filled
her with sudden terror.

2215
02:26:32,289 --> 02:26:36,379
She felt sick as she remembered the day he
had given her a lift home.

2216
02:26:36,379 --> 02:26:41,810
Of course, he knew where she lived.

2217
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:44,829
Francesca's anxiety grew all day.

2218
02:26:44,829 --> 02:26:50,520
She tried to occupy her thoughts by keeping
busy: cleaning the house with extra thoroughness

2219
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:52,039
and making a cake.

2220
02:26:52,039 --> 02:26:57,800
But several times she went back to her bedroom
window to see if the car had returned.

2221
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:02,959
And when she went to fetch the children from
school, she couldn't get rid of the feeling

2222
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:09,060
that Doug might be there, hiding behind a
tree, or creeping along behind her.

2223
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:14,780
That evening Tom had invited Francesca for
a meal at his flat.

2224
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:20,090
It was the first time she'd seen where he
lived, and she could tell immediately that

2225
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:23,600
he'd gone to a lot of trouble in order to
impress her.

2226
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:30,220
He'd obviously been busy tidying because everywhere
smelt of cleaning products, and there were

2227
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:32,859
flowers and candles on the table.

2228
02:27:32,859 --> 02:27:36,079
The evening started well.

2229
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:41,850
The flat was full of Tom's drawings and paintings,
and just as Francesca had guessed, they were

2230
02:27:41,850 --> 02:27:49,899
brilliant - detailed drawings of birds like
owls and hawks, aircraft painted against beautiful

2231
02:27:49,899 --> 02:27:56,949
skies, and then a whole series of pencil drawings
of a young girl, Tom's niece apparently.

2232
02:27:56,949 --> 02:28:02,740
The expressions on the child's face were so
real that Francesca thought the girl might

2233
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:06,050
suddenly come to life and step out of the
picture.

2234
02:28:06,050 --> 02:28:10,020
'Have you ever tried to sell your work?'

2235
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:11,020
Francesca asked.

2236
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:16,100
'I didn't think it was good enough,' Tom answered.

2237
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:18,319
Francesca shook her head in astonishment.

2238
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:22,380
'Tom, you must,' she said.

2239
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:26,739
Then she added more quietly, 'Would you do
a drawing of me some time?

2240
02:28:26,739 --> 02:28:30,119
I could send it to my family - they'd love
it.

2241
02:28:30,119 --> 02:28:32,659
I'll pay you, of course.'

2242
02:28:32,659 --> 02:28:35,899
'I'd love to,' Tom replied, delighted.

2243
02:28:35,899 --> 02:28:42,869
'But if you try and give me any money, I'll
be very upset.'

2244
02:28:42,869 --> 02:28:46,399
Tom had made a great effort with the meal,
too.

2245
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:52,029
For the first course, he'd made a tomato salad
- using the very best 'buffalo' mozzarella

2246
02:28:52,029 --> 02:28:59,909
cheese, and then for the main course, a mushroom
risotto, which was delicious.

2247
02:28:59,909 --> 02:29:05,100
Francesca could see Tom felt very proud that
the meal had turned out so well, and she liked

2248
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:08,659
him even more for all the attention he gave.

2249
02:29:08,659 --> 02:29:13,580
The more she got to know him, the more she
felt that this was the sort of person he was

2250
02:29:13,580 --> 02:29:19,949
- an artist - and he'd spent his whole life
trying to be someone different.

2251
02:29:19,949 --> 02:29:26,720
Perhaps his father was to blame, wanting Tom
to be a copy of himself.

2252
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:32,569
But despite all Tom's efforts, Francesca couldn't
fully relax.

2253
02:29:32,569 --> 02:29:35,659
She kept thinking about the grey Audi.

2254
02:29:35,659 --> 02:29:38,149
Should she tell Tom about it or not?

2255
02:29:38,149 --> 02:29:42,050
Would he think she was crazy?

2256
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:48,060
After the meal, Tom made some coffee and they
went over to his sofa.

2257
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:52,470
Francesca knew that Tom was hoping that the
evening would end romantically.

2258
02:29:52,470 --> 02:29:58,279
'I was just thinking,' she said, unable to
stop herself at last.

2259
02:29:58,279 --> 02:30:03,090
'Do you know what kind of car Doug drives?'

2260
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:05,140
Tom frowned in disappointment.

2261
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:08,379
'An Audi, I think.

2262
02:30:08,379 --> 02:30:09,379
Why?'

2263
02:30:09,379 --> 02:30:12,350
'No reason,' Francesca answered quickly.

2264
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:16,670
'I just thought I might have seen his car
in our road today, that's all.'

2265
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:19,609
'But what would Doug be doing there?'

2266
02:30:19,609 --> 02:30:21,249
Tom asked innocently.

2267
02:30:21,249 --> 02:30:24,569
'I don't know,' Francesca answered.

2268
02:30:24,569 --> 02:30:27,220
'That's why I wanted to check on his car.

2269
02:30:27,220 --> 02:30:31,510
Do you know what the number plate is?'

2270
02:30:31,510 --> 02:30:34,619
Tom looked at her in confusion.

2271
02:30:34,619 --> 02:30:36,000
Francesca shook her head.

2272
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,460
'No, of course you wouldn't.

2273
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:42,879
That was a bit of a stupid question.'

2274
02:30:42,879 --> 02:30:45,930
With that she changed the subject.

2275
02:30:45,930 --> 02:30:50,409
Doing so made her even angrier with herself
than she was already.

2276
02:30:50,409 --> 02:30:56,020
She knew that she ought to tell Tom the true
reason for her concern; this was the perfect

2277
02:30:56,020 --> 02:30:59,079
moment to get the whole business out in the
open.

2278
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:01,819
But for some reason she couldn't.

2279
02:31:01,819 --> 02:31:08,279
The more time went on, the more difficult
it was.

2280
02:31:08,279 --> 02:31:14,909
After a while, Francesca asked Tom to take
her home, complaining of a headache.

2281
02:31:14,909 --> 02:31:19,739
Francesca could see that it hurt him badly
and was a blow to his confidence, but he was

2282
02:31:19,739 --> 02:31:24,199
too much of gentleman to say anything.

2283
02:31:24,199 --> 02:31:30,039
Francesca was silent on the way home, full
of anger with herself for spoiling the evening.

2284
02:31:30,039 --> 02:31:34,109
If only she'd never begun lessons with Fastwings!

2285
02:31:34,109 --> 02:31:38,100
If only she'd never met Doug!

2286
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:43,539
Tom kissed her sweetly when he dropped her
home, but Francesca ran inside before he could

2287
02:31:43,539 --> 02:31:47,060
see the tears rolling down her cheeks.

2288
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:50,199
She couldn't believe what was happening to
her.

2289
02:31:50,199 --> 02:31:55,459
This was the second time she'd cried in less
than a month.

2290
02:31:55,459 --> 02:31:56,459
***

2291
02:31:56,459 --> 02:32:02,449
The following Tuesday George sent Francesca
off on her first 'landaway'.

2292
02:32:02,449 --> 02:32:05,069
'What's that?'

2293
02:32:05,069 --> 02:32:06,069
Francesca asked.

2294
02:32:06,069 --> 02:32:12,109
'You go off on your own to land at another
airfield, and then, with a bit of luck, you

2295
02:32:12,109 --> 02:32:14,439
come back,' George replied cheerfully.

2296
02:32:14,439 --> 02:32:19,350
'I want you to fly down to Beccles just like
we did last week.

2297
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:25,489
Go into the office, get Stan to sign your
logbook, then fly straight back here.

2298
02:32:25,489 --> 02:32:28,909
Sound simple enough?'

2299
02:32:28,909 --> 02:32:31,959
Francesca couldn't wait to get into the air.

2300
02:32:31,959 --> 02:32:37,829
The last three days had been a nightmare of
anxiety - checking the street for signs of

2301
02:32:37,829 --> 02:32:40,470
Doug, trying to decide what to do.

2302
02:32:40,470 --> 02:32:45,749
When she'd arrived at the airfield earlier,
she'd resisted the temptation to go straight

2303
02:32:45,749 --> 02:32:49,279
to look for Doug's car and check the number
plate.

2304
02:32:49,279 --> 02:32:55,680
She would try to do it after her lesson, but
now she needed to concentrate on flying.

2305
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:02,069
Soon, she thought, she would be up in the
air and all those fears would melt away.

2306
02:33:02,069 --> 02:33:07,479
But as she approached the runway, she felt
as tense as ever.

2307
02:33:07,479 --> 02:33:09,970
Was Doug at the airfield now?

2308
02:33:09,970 --> 02:33:12,260
Was he listening in to the radio calls?

2309
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:14,649
Did he know she was there?

2310
02:33:14,649 --> 02:33:22,100
Once shed taken off, however, as if by magic,
her anxiety began to slip away.

2311
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:28,529
She climbed steadily to 3000 feet, then turned
south-east and headed for Beccles.

2312
02:33:28,529 --> 02:33:35,979
It was a beautiful day, the colours of the
sky and fields below intensely clear and bright.

2313
02:33:35,979 --> 02:33:41,229
Looking down the length of the wings, she
had the sensation once more that they might

2314
02:33:41,229 --> 02:33:43,180
be her arms.

2315
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:48,479
She moved the control column left and right
very gently and watched with delight how the

2316
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,119
wings responded.

2317
02:33:50,119 --> 02:33:53,720
It gave her a huge sense of freedom.

2318
02:33:53,720 --> 02:33:59,999
She was untouchable up there in the sky, completely
out of reach!

2319
02:33:59,999 --> 02:34:05,060
The landing at Beccles went well, and Stan
was friendly when she went to get her logbook

2320
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:06,060
signed.

2321
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:11,779
She loved the little airfield with its grass
runway and handful of light aircraft.

2322
02:34:11,779 --> 02:34:18,439
It made her feel connected to all the aviators
of the past, taking to the skies in wooden

2323
02:34:18,439 --> 02:34:22,039
aircraft and open cockpits.

2324
02:34:22,039 --> 02:34:26,970
Refusing a cup of tea and saying she ought
to head home, Francesca climbed back into

2325
02:34:26,970 --> 02:34:29,930
the plane and very soon took off.

2326
02:34:29,930 --> 02:34:36,909
As she turned towards Norwich, she radioed
back to Stan below and said a cheerful goodbye.

2327
02:34:36,909 --> 02:34:45,619
It was about five minutes later, when she'd
reached 3000 feet, that an odd sensation came

2328
02:34:45,619 --> 02:34:46,800
to her.

2329
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:53,819
Performing her regular check of the sky around,
she caught sight of something over her shoulder.

2330
02:34:53,819 --> 02:34:56,710
Immediately, she looked behind.

2331
02:34:56,710 --> 02:35:04,199
A plane - another Cessna - was flying very
close to her, perhaps ten metres below and

2332
02:35:04,199 --> 02:35:06,410
as many metres behind.

2333
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:10,100
The shock almost made her let go of the control
column.

2334
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:14,609
It was Doug in the Fastwings Cessna.

2335
02:35:14,609 --> 02:35:19,899
She glanced behind again and saw him quite
clearly; he was looking out of the cockpit

2336
02:35:19,899 --> 02:35:24,640
window and staring directly at her.

2337
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:26,100
Francesca wanted to scream.

2338
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:31,539
A terrible panic rushed up through her body,
paralysing her for a minute.

2339
02:35:31,539 --> 02:35:37,529
Suddenly, she didn't know how to fly the plane,
or what any of the controls were for.

2340
02:35:37,529 --> 02:35:41,039
She didn't want to look round, and yet she
couldn't stop herself.

2341
02:35:41,039 --> 02:35:48,789
But every time she did, Doug was still there,
his sunglasses staring blindly back.

2342
02:35:48,789 --> 02:35:53,829
She felt helpless, with no idea what to do.

2343
02:35:53,829 --> 02:35:59,169
All of a sudden she realised he must have
followed her to Beccles, then circled somewhere

2344
02:35:59,169 --> 02:36:02,770
overhead until he heard her make her take-off
calls.

2345
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:07,090
Then he'd come swooping down out of the sky,
just like a hawk.

2346
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:09,910
But what did he want?

2347
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:14,140
Was he just trying to scare her or would he
try to make her crash?

2348
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:20,239
She flew on, her hands shaking on the control
column, trying to imagine what would happen

2349
02:36:20,239 --> 02:36:21,649
next.

2350
02:36:21,649 --> 02:36:27,180
And then, just as suddenly as he'd appeared
on her shoulder, he was gone.

2351
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:33,239
The next time she looked round, there was
no sign of the aircraft anywhere.

2352
02:36:33,239 --> 02:36:38,420
She searched the sky, but the plane had simply
disappeared.

2353
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:44,729
When she finally landed back at Norwich, George
and Tom were both waiting for her.

2354
02:36:44,729 --> 02:36:46,470
'How was it then?'

2355
02:36:46,470 --> 02:36:47,789
Tom asked.

2356
02:36:47,789 --> 02:36:48,840
'Fine.

2357
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:52,020
Just fine,' Francesca answered weakly.

2358
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:55,949
'You look a bit pale,' he went on anxiously.

2359
02:36:55,949 --> 02:36:59,430
'Do you feel all right?'

2360
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:00,939
Francesca didn't say anything.

2361
02:37:00,939 --> 02:37:06,310
Without another word, she hurried through
to the toilets at the back of the hangar and

2362
02:37:06,310 --> 02:37:11,090
was violently sick.

2363
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:15,810
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

2364
02:37:15,810 --> 02:37:20,069
The stalker

2365
02:37:20,069 --> 02:37:25,289
Francesca was watching television that evening,
when she heard a text arrive on her phone.

2366
02:37:25,289 --> 02:37:29,699
Thinking it would be Tom, she immediately
opened the message.

2367
02:37:29,699 --> 02:37:32,729
'Sorry if I frightened you!'

2368
02:37:32,729 --> 02:37:33,729
she read.

2369
02:37:33,729 --> 02:37:37,079
'For a moment I was afraid you might crash!

2370
02:37:37,079 --> 02:37:40,840
Best of luck with the rest of your lessons.

2371
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:42,830
Doug'

2372
02:37:42,830 --> 02:37:46,689
Francesca didn't know what to do with herself
for the rest of the evening.

2373
02:37:46,689 --> 02:37:49,859
She wanted to scream out loud.

2374
02:37:49,859 --> 02:37:56,229
The man was hunting her, following her around,
keeping at a safe distance, but making sure

2375
02:37:56,229 --> 02:37:59,199
she knew he was there all the time.

2376
02:37:59,199 --> 02:38:06,880
There was a word for what he was doing - the
man was stalking her; he was a stalker.

2377
02:38:06,880 --> 02:38:10,420
It was the same word in Italian.

2378
02:38:10,420 --> 02:38:14,069
She felt a great knot of anger growing in
her chest.

2379
02:38:14,069 --> 02:38:17,430
What did he want?

2380
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:22,590
Somehow it seemed to her that Doug was no
longer interested in her for sex, it was as

2381
02:38:22,590 --> 02:38:26,109
though things had gone beyond that desire.

2382
02:38:26,109 --> 02:38:30,419
Now what he wanted was to make her suffer
as much as he could.

2383
02:38:30,419 --> 02:38:33,390
Wasn't that the point of the message?

2384
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:38,479
'Sorry if I frightened you' meant just the
opposite.

2385
02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:42,439
He wasn't wishing her good luck with her lessons.

2386
02:38:42,439 --> 02:38:46,129
Doug was determined to scare her to death.

2387
02:38:46,129 --> 02:38:53,590
Lying in bed that night, Francesca tried to
decide what she could do.

2388
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:57,119
The idea of going to the police was out of
the question.

2389
02:38:57,119 --> 02:38:58,899
What would she tell them?

2390
02:38:58,899 --> 02:39:03,199
That the man had put his hand on her knee
and touched her a couple of times?

2391
02:39:03,199 --> 02:39:05,649
What else had he done?

2392
02:39:05,649 --> 02:39:08,340
He didn't even have her money any more.

2393
02:39:08,340 --> 02:39:14,399
There had been a couple of angry phone calls,
she 'thought she'd seen his car outside the

2394
02:39:14,399 --> 02:39:18,430
house, and now he'd flown up alongside her.

2395
02:39:18,430 --> 02:39:23,649
Even the text message could be read as nothing
more than cheerful good wishes.

2396
02:39:23,649 --> 02:39:30,749
The police would laugh at her, and yet she
knew Doug was stalking her.

2397
02:39:30,749 --> 02:39:38,369
So, what about telling someone else: for instance,
telling Tom or Mrs Thompson what was going

2398
02:39:38,369 --> 02:39:39,369
on?

2399
02:39:39,369 --> 02:39:40,749
How would that help?

2400
02:39:40,749 --> 02:39:42,770
What could they do?

2401
02:39:42,770 --> 02:39:45,800
What if she told Tom the whole story?

2402
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:48,010
How would he react?

2403
02:39:48,010 --> 02:39:53,310
She knew he'd do everything he could - she
could picture him bravely marching up to the

2404
02:39:53,310 --> 02:39:57,899
Fastwings hangar and getting into a fight
with Doug.

2405
02:39:57,899 --> 02:40:03,520
Although she liked the idea of a courageous
Tom coming to her rescue, it wasn't something

2406
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:06,680
she could ever accept.

2407
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:11,979
Francesca always fought her own battles and
she didn't let others take her place.

2408
02:40:11,979 --> 02:40:18,399
By the time she finally fell asleep, Francesca
had decided that if she was going to stay

2409
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:23,439
in England, the only thing to do was to go
and see Doug herself.

2410
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:24,439
***

2411
02:40:24,439 --> 02:40:32,250
The next morning, once she'd taken the children
to school, Francesca took the bus straight

2412
02:40:32,250 --> 02:40:34,430
up to the airfield.

2413
02:40:34,430 --> 02:40:39,689
She didn't tell Tom she was coming - indeed,
she didn't even call in at the Flying Start

2414
02:40:39,689 --> 02:40:41,749
office.

2415
02:40:41,749 --> 02:40:46,740
Instead she went straight to Fastwings.

2416
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:53,100
Outside the entrance, she paused for a moment
or two and tried to calm her nerves.

2417
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:59,220
Then, before she could change her mind, she
went directly inside and down the small corridor

2418
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:01,350
to the Fastwings office.

2419
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:08,930
As soon as she reached it, she could see through
the glass door that Doug wasn't there.

2420
02:41:08,930 --> 02:41:13,160
A strange sense of anti-climax ran through
her.

2421
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:19,270
Having prepared herself so bravely for meeting
up with him, it seemed doubly cruel that it

2422
02:41:19,270 --> 02:41:22,089
should all be for nothing.

2423
02:41:22,089 --> 02:41:23,990
She didn't know what to do.

2424
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:29,859
She couldn't wait long: she had jobs to do
at home for Mrs Thompson that morning.

2425
02:41:29,859 --> 02:41:35,869
She was still trying to decide how long to
wait, when a strange feeling made her turn

2426
02:41:35,869 --> 02:41:37,039
round.

2427
02:41:37,039 --> 02:41:41,819
Doug was standing there, only a couple of
metres behind her.

2428
02:41:41,819 --> 02:41:45,149
He was holding a large hammer.

2429
02:41:45,149 --> 02:41:47,109
Francesca felt very frightened.

2430
02:41:47,109 --> 02:41:54,379
'Well, well, this is a surprise,' Doug said,
with a look of slight amusement.

2431
02:41:54,379 --> 02:41:59,659
Then, seeing Francesca's expression, he gave
a small wave with the hammer.

2432
02:41:59,659 --> 02:42:02,869
'It's all right, just a problem with the hangar
door.

2433
02:42:02,869 --> 02:42:06,399
Nothing for you to worry about,' he said.

2434
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:12,770
'Just yet...' he added, giving a short laugh.

2435
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:15,619
Francesca tried not to lose her nerve.

2436
02:42:15,619 --> 02:42:19,399
'I'd like to talk to you for a minute,' she
said.

2437
02:42:19,399 --> 02:42:22,640
'Of course, come into the office.

2438
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:30,790
Is it just you or have you got your lawyer
with you?' he asked with heavy sarcasm.

2439
02:42:30,790 --> 02:42:32,930
Francesca ignored the remark.

2440
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:36,949
She didn't want to go inside, but there seemed
little choice.

2441
02:42:36,949 --> 02:42:41,659
Swallowing hard, she followed Doug through
into the office.

2442
02:42:41,659 --> 02:42:47,510
As she did so, she caught a faint smell of
alcohol in the atmosphere.

2443
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:48,729
Had he been drinking?

2444
02:42:48,729 --> 02:42:51,600
The thought frightened her even more.

2445
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:57,350
He dropped the hammer on his desk and gestured
to her to sit down.

2446
02:42:57,350 --> 02:43:02,329
Francesca wanted to remain standing, but Doug
was already sitting behind his desk with his

2447
02:43:02,329 --> 02:43:04,989
feet on the table.

2448
02:43:04,989 --> 02:43:10,680
She sat on the edge of the sofa opposite,
trying not to look directly at him.

2449
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:12,600
There was a weird look in his eyes.

2450
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:17,479
'So, have you got fed up with Flying Start?'

2451
02:43:17,479 --> 02:43:19,810
Doug asked with a curling lip.

2452
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:27,630
'Or has lover boy tried to push his luck too
far?' he added, then smiled with satisfaction

2453
02:43:27,630 --> 02:43:30,760
at Francesca's shock.

2454
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:33,670
Francesca was taken completely off guard.

2455
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:36,270
How had he found out about her and Tom?

2456
02:43:36,270 --> 02:43:37,879
Had someone told him?

2457
02:43:37,879 --> 02:43:44,319
'Oh yes,' Doug went on, 'I know all about
you and Tom Brennan.

2458
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:47,919
You should find somewhere more private, Francesca.

2459
02:43:47,919 --> 02:43:51,999
Really - climbing all over one another in
his Ford Focus!

2460
02:43:51,999 --> 02:43:54,859
I thought you'd have more style than that.

2461
02:43:54,859 --> 02:43:56,839
And with a loser like him!

2462
02:43:56,839 --> 02:43:58,959
Honestly, Francesca!'

2463
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:01,169
He grinned once again.

2464
02:44:01,169 --> 02:44:08,100
'Anyway, I didn't mean to spoil your visit
with cheap insults about your boyfriend.

2465
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:12,170
Perhaps you've come to apologise?'

2466
02:44:12,170 --> 02:44:14,260
Francesca felt sick for a moment.

2467
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:19,899
When she'd decided to come and see Doug, she'd
imagined the meeting quite differently.

2468
02:44:19,899 --> 02:44:25,649
She'd imagined marching into his office and
making her speech confidently, without fear,

2469
02:44:25,649 --> 02:44:28,180
in a sensible adult manner.

2470
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:31,899
But Doug had caught her by surprise.

2471
02:44:31,899 --> 02:44:37,410
He must have been in Brabazon Road one night
when Tom had taken her home.

2472
02:44:37,410 --> 02:44:41,250
He must have been spying on them for ages.

2473
02:44:41,250 --> 02:44:43,869
The idea filled her with fresh anger.

2474
02:44:43,869 --> 02:44:44,890
'Me?

2475
02:44:44,890 --> 02:44:45,909
Apologise!

2476
02:44:45,909 --> 02:44:53,609
I shall never apologise to you,' she began,
trying to keep control of her voice.

2477
02:44:53,609 --> 02:44:58,699
'I came to tell you to leave me alone.'

2478
02:44:58,699 --> 02:45:00,500
Doug gave a small frown.

2479
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:09,289
'I'm sorry, Francesca,' he said, 'I don't
think I quite understand.'

2480
02:45:09,289 --> 02:45:11,640
Francesca closed her eyes.

2481
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:13,560
How had it come to this?

2482
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:17,029
Did she really deserve this misery?

2483
02:45:17,029 --> 02:45:20,079
All she wanted was to learn to fly.

2484
02:45:20,079 --> 02:45:23,590
'You're stalking me,' she said quietly.

2485
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:25,489
'I know you are.

2486
02:45:25,489 --> 02:45:31,430
You've been following me in your car; now
you're following me in your plane.'

2487
02:45:31,430 --> 02:45:34,069
Doug gave a look of astonishment.

2488
02:45:34,069 --> 02:45:37,779
It was pure acting, Francesca knew it was.

2489
02:45:37,779 --> 02:45:40,770
Even Doug seemed to know it wasn't convincing.

2490
02:45:40,770 --> 02:45:46,100
Pushing back against his chair, he put his
hands together behind his head.

2491
02:45:46,100 --> 02:45:52,749
'I'm sorry, Francesca, but I can't believe
what I'm hearing,' he said.

2492
02:45:52,749 --> 02:45:59,949
'Are you really accusing me of stalking you,
just because I happened to be flying over

2493
02:45:59,949 --> 02:46:03,489
Beccles at the same time as you a couple of
days ago?

2494
02:46:03,489 --> 02:46:12,089
Do we men have to keep out of the air every
time Francesca Bartolli takes to the skies?'

2495
02:46:12,089 --> 02:46:13,909
Francesca tried to keep herself calm.

2496
02:46:13,909 --> 02:46:15,550
'But you were!

2497
02:46:15,550 --> 02:46:18,109
You were stalking me!'

2498
02:46:18,109 --> 02:46:19,109
she exclaimed.

2499
02:46:19,109 --> 02:46:25,100
'I've seen your car outside my house in Brabazon
Road and you've just admitted seeing Tom and

2500
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:26,289
me in his car!

2501
02:46:26,289 --> 02:46:30,439
You're following me around and spying on me!

2502
02:46:30,439 --> 02:46:31,819
Why are you doing this?

2503
02:46:31,819 --> 02:46:35,449
What do you want from me?'

2504
02:46:35,449 --> 02:46:41,149
Doug watched Francesca for a little while,
all the time the same cruel smile playing

2505
02:46:41,149 --> 02:46:42,779
at his lips.

2506
02:46:42,779 --> 02:46:49,649
Then, with the amusement dying on his face,
he slowly took his feet from the desk and

2507
02:46:49,649 --> 02:46:53,170
sat forward with a cold bitter expression.

2508
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:58,079
'I don't want anything from you, Francesca,'
he said.

2509
02:46:58,079 --> 02:47:01,589
'OK, it might have been nice if you'd been
more...

2510
02:47:01,589 --> 02:47:04,680
how shall I put it... friendly?

2511
02:47:04,680 --> 02:47:10,260
Indeed, I might have reduced your flying fees
even more if you had!'

2512
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:15,439
He gave a strange laugh at the idea for a
moment, and Francesca wondered again if he'd

2513
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:16,790
been drinking.

2514
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:20,050
Then he immediately grew serious again.

2515
02:47:20,050 --> 02:47:23,689
'But that time has long gone, my dear.

2516
02:47:23,689 --> 02:47:28,560
Now I get a kick from just seeing the terror
on your face.'

2517
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:35,609
He paused, watching Francesca with cold lifeless
eyes.

2518
02:47:35,609 --> 02:47:37,990
Francesca was reminded of a snake.

2519
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:41,789
'So you admit that you've been stalking me!'

2520
02:47:41,789 --> 02:47:44,319
she said desperately.

2521
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:47,170
Doug continued staring at her.

2522
02:47:47,170 --> 02:47:50,620
'I admit nothing.

2523
02:47:50,620 --> 02:47:56,989
If you think I've been stalking you, then
prove it,' he said, his voice getting louder.

2524
02:47:56,989 --> 02:48:00,539
'Now, get out of my office before I call the
police.

2525
02:48:00,539 --> 02:48:03,359
I haven't got time for this!'

2526
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:09,119
As he said that, Doug picked up the hammer
he had left on the desk and smashed it down

2527
02:48:09,119 --> 02:48:12,159
as hard as possible on the wood.

2528
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:18,430
There was a tremendous crash and part of the
desk cracked, sending a tray spinning to the

2529
02:48:18,430 --> 02:48:19,430
floor.

2530
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:21,739
'Didn't you hear me?'

2531
02:48:21,739 --> 02:48:24,659
Doug shouted, his eyes wild with madness.

2532
02:48:24,659 --> 02:48:27,100
'I told you to get out!

2533
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:32,449
Don't you understand the English language?'

2534
02:48:32,449 --> 02:48:33,779
Francesca froze.

2535
02:48:33,779 --> 02:48:37,260
The man was completely out of control.

2536
02:48:37,260 --> 02:48:39,359
He was drunk.

2537
02:48:39,359 --> 02:48:41,180
She rushed for the door.

2538
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:45,909
As she left the office, she looked back to
see Doug getting up from his chair, the hammer

2539
02:48:45,909 --> 02:48:49,300
still gripped tightly in his hand.

2540
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:54,970
She ran down the corridor and out into the
open air in genuine fear of her life.

2541
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:59,399
She didn't stop shaking until she was safely
on the bus home.

2542
02:48:59,399 --> 02:49:05,989
There, as she sat hiding her face in her hands,
a little old lady asked her if she was feeling

2543
02:49:05,989 --> 02:49:07,350
all right.

2544
02:49:07,350 --> 02:49:11,560
'Yes, I think so,' Francesca answered.

2545
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:17,949
Then, realising it was a bit of an odd reply,
she added, 'I nearly got myself killed a minute

2546
02:49:17,949 --> 02:49:24,050
ago - when I was crossing the road.'

2547
02:49:24,050 --> 02:49:27,949
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

2548
02:49:27,949 --> 02:49:33,209
A matter of practice

2549
02:49:33,209 --> 02:49:39,319
For the next four days, apart from taking
the children to and from school, Francesca

2550
02:49:39,319 --> 02:49:41,350
didn't leave the house.

2551
02:49:41,350 --> 02:49:43,640
She simply didn't feel safe.

2552
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:49,930
Saying she had a bad headache, she even cancelled
her next flying lesson on Thursday afternoon.

2553
02:49:49,930 --> 02:49:56,880
At the weekend Tom invited her out twice,
but she refused both times.

2554
02:49:56,880 --> 02:50:04,380
She sat miserably in her room, unable to concentrate
on anything and trying not to go to the window

2555
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:06,600
to look out.

2556
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:13,629
By Monday morning she'd almost made a final
decision to go back to Switzerland - one hundred

2557
02:50:13,629 --> 02:50:16,350
percent definitely this time.

2558
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:23,270
How her relationship with Tom could survive
after that she couldn't imagine.

2559
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:28,630
Whatever the case, she decided to ring Flying
Start that morning and cancel her lesson the

2560
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:30,399
next day.

2561
02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:36,609
Listening to the number ring, she half hoped
somebody other than Tom would answer, but

2562
02:50:36,609 --> 02:50:38,890
of course it was him.

2563
02:50:38,890 --> 02:50:41,390
'Hello,' he said brightly.

2564
02:50:41,390 --> 02:50:43,359
'Flying Start.'

2565
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:48,100
'Tom,' she said quietly, 'it's Francesca.

2566
02:50:48,100 --> 02:50:55,489
Tom,' she went on before he could say anything,
'I'm just ringing to say I still don't think

2567
02:50:55,489 --> 02:50:59,199
I'm well enough for tomorrow's lesson.'

2568
02:50:59,199 --> 02:51:01,529
Tom's voice dropped immediately.

2569
02:51:01,529 --> 02:51:04,220
'Oh no, poor you!

2570
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:05,220
Really?

2571
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:09,350
Is your headache still bad?'

2572
02:51:09,350 --> 02:51:11,569
Francesca felt like a complete fraud.

2573
02:51:11,569 --> 02:51:14,699
She knew she had to talk to him.

2574
02:51:14,699 --> 02:51:17,720
She was about to say something when Tom interrupted.

2575
02:51:17,720 --> 02:51:25,339
'I was so much hoping you'd be OK - and I
heard a bit of news this morning that I thought

2576
02:51:25,339 --> 02:51:26,489
would interest you.'

2577
02:51:26,489 --> 02:51:27,489
'What?'

2578
02:51:27,489 --> 02:51:29,129
Francesca asked.

2579
02:51:29,129 --> 02:51:33,689
'Fastwings has gone out of business,' Tom
said.

2580
02:51:33,689 --> 02:51:35,709
Francesca wasn't sure she understood.

2581
02:51:35,709 --> 02:51:37,800
'What do you mean?'

2582
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:38,800
she asked.

2583
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:44,000
'I mean Doug's finished, that's what I mean,'
Tom replied.

2584
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,500
'Apparently there's a notice on his office
door this morning saying "Fastwings regrets

2585
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:53,810
to announce that, with immediate effect, it
has stopped trading".

2586
02:51:53,810 --> 02:52:00,020
What's more, I've heard his Cessna is up for
sale on the Internet.'

2587
02:52:00,020 --> 02:52:03,159
Tom finally came to the end of his speech.

2588
02:52:03,159 --> 02:52:08,569
All the while he'd been speaking Francesca
had been trying to absorb the news and what

2589
02:52:08,569 --> 02:52:09,670
it meant for her.

2590
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:15,609
Did it mean there was a chance she would be
able to continue with her flying lessons?

2591
02:52:15,609 --> 02:52:19,169
Did it mean she could stay in England after
all?

2592
02:52:19,169 --> 02:52:20,390
'Francesca?

2593
02:52:20,390 --> 02:52:21,800
Are you still there?'

2594
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:22,930
Tom asked.

2595
02:52:22,930 --> 02:52:27,319
'Yes... yes, of course,' Francesca answered.

2596
02:52:27,319 --> 02:52:30,129
'But I was just thinking...

2597
02:52:30,129 --> 02:52:33,749
I suppose that means Doug won't be up at the
airfield any more.'

2598
02:52:33,749 --> 02:52:38,079
'I can't see why he should be,' Tom replied.

2599
02:52:38,079 --> 02:52:42,170
Anyway, apparently he's left Norwich and run
off up north.

2600
02:52:42,170 --> 02:52:45,930
But you won't be sorry about that, will you?'

2601
02:52:45,930 --> 02:52:50,439
'No, no I won't,' Francesca answered.

2602
02:52:50,439 --> 02:52:53,939
It seemed to her as if ice was melting around
her.

2603
02:52:53,939 --> 02:52:57,439
For days her body had felt frozen.

2604
02:52:57,439 --> 02:53:01,579
Now the sun had come out again; there was
life!

2605
02:53:01,579 --> 02:53:05,689
'Anyway,' Tom went on, 'Thank God you got
out in time.

2606
02:53:05,689 --> 02:53:11,879
I mean, if you were still having lessons with
him, you might have lost all your money.'

2607
02:53:11,879 --> 02:53:13,129
'Really?'

2608
02:53:13,129 --> 02:53:14,129
Francesca said.

2609
02:53:14,129 --> 02:53:15,770
'Yes, sure.

2610
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:17,669
You could have lost the lot!'

2611
02:53:17,669 --> 02:53:18,779
Tom continued.

2612
02:53:18,779 --> 02:53:23,720
'Come to think of it, I guess losing your
business can't have helped him much.'

2613
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:26,850
'Yes,' Francesca answered.

2614
02:53:26,850 --> 02:53:34,819
She'd been thinking the same herself; perhaps
that was why he seemed to hate her so much.

2615
02:53:34,819 --> 02:53:37,630
'Anyway,' Tom said, breaking into her thoughts.

2616
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:40,600
Are you sure you won't be well enough for
the lesson tomorrow?'

2617
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:42,970
'What do you mean?'

2618
02:53:42,970 --> 02:53:44,260
she asked.

2619
02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:48,790
'Your headache,' Tom said, sounding a little
confused.

2620
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:54,699
'Oh, that,' Francesca answered, even more
ashamed now about her excuse.

2621
02:53:54,699 --> 02:54:00,939
'On second thoughts, perhaps it would do it
good if I got out for a while.'

2622
02:54:00,939 --> 02:54:03,199
'Brilliant,' Tom said.

2623
02:54:03,199 --> 02:54:09,340
'In that case, is there any chance I could
see you tonight?'

2624
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:11,899
Francesca felt a smile breaking out on her
face.

2625
02:54:11,899 --> 02:54:16,529
'All right, I don't see why not,' she said
happily.

2626
02:54:16,529 --> 02:54:20,779
'That would be great.'

2627
02:54:20,779 --> 02:54:21,779
***

2628
02:54:21,779 --> 02:54:26,510
The next afternoon, Francesca was 3000 feet
above the East Anglian fields, flying with

2629
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:27,810
George again.

2630
02:54:27,810 --> 02:54:34,329
They'd been practising advanced turns, first
putting the aircraft into a tight 43-degree

2631
02:54:34,329 --> 02:54:43,020
turn, and then even tighter, so that the plane
was over on its side at 60 degrees or more.

2632
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:45,220
Francesca's head was spinning.

2633
02:54:45,220 --> 02:54:50,039
Pulling back on the control column and holding
the nose level on the horizon had made her

2634
02:54:50,039 --> 02:54:53,539
feel quite dizzy.

2635
02:54:53,539 --> 02:54:57,300
Francesca was feeling a little dizzy too with
everything that was happening in the rest

2636
02:54:57,300 --> 02:54:59,329
of her life.

2637
02:54:59,329 --> 02:55:05,129
Knowing that Doug wasn't in Norwich any more,
meant life could return to normal.

2638
02:55:05,129 --> 02:55:09,779
She was still afraid though that it might
all be a dream and she would turn a corner

2639
02:55:09,779 --> 02:55:12,850
and find the grey Audi waiting there.

2640
02:55:12,850 --> 02:55:19,560
But no one had seen any sign of Doug at the
airfield and she began to believe it at last.

2641
02:55:19,560 --> 02:55:22,489
And then there was Tom.

2642
02:55:22,489 --> 02:55:28,109
In the few days since his phone call, things
had become much more serious in their relationship.

2643
02:55:28,109 --> 02:55:33,680
Perhaps the thought of returning to Switzerland
and breaking up with him had concentrated

2644
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:35,659
her mind.

2645
02:55:35,659 --> 02:55:41,689
Whatever it was, Francesca had come to see
very clearly that she wasn't just fond of

2646
02:55:41,689 --> 02:55:42,689
Tom.

2647
02:55:42,689 --> 02:55:45,430
She was most definitely in love.

2648
02:55:45,430 --> 02:55:51,800
'I think it's about time we did a PFL,' George
said, interrupting her thoughts.

2649
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:54,029
'What's that?'

2650
02:55:54,029 --> 02:55:55,089
Francesca asked.

2651
02:55:55,089 --> 02:55:57,229
'A PFL?'

2652
02:55:57,229 --> 02:55:58,229
George replied.

2653
02:55:58,229 --> 02:56:05,829
'A PFL is a practice forced landing - a bit
like we did last time - engine failure, but

2654
02:56:05,829 --> 02:56:07,810
this time from higher up.

2655
02:56:07,810 --> 02:56:14,550
I pull out the throttle, you choose a field
in which to land, then we can glide down doing

2656
02:56:14,550 --> 02:56:18,629
all the engine checks and emergency calls.'

2657
02:56:18,629 --> 02:56:21,100
'And do we actually land?'

2658
02:56:21,100 --> 02:56:22,100
Francesca asked.

2659
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:29,089
'Not unless you want to pay the farmer for
damage to his field,' George said, smiling.

2660
02:56:29,089 --> 02:56:36,020
'But we do go down to about 200 feet - low
enough to see if we'd survive the landing.'

2661
02:56:36,020 --> 02:56:42,279
'Sounds fun,' Francesca answered, who was
growing in confidence with each flying-hour

2662
02:56:42,279 --> 02:56:44,640
that passed.

2663
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:49,959
They flew on for a couple of minutes, then
George reached forward slowly and pulled out

2664
02:56:49,959 --> 02:56:51,630
the throttle.

2665
02:56:51,630 --> 02:56:58,000
Instantly, the engine noise died and Francesca
felt the plane slow.

2666
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:03,060
'You have engine failure, Ms Bartolli,' George
said quietly.

2667
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:06,739
This time Francesca reacted quickly.

2668
02:57:06,739 --> 02:57:12,550
Pushing the control column forward, she put
the aircraft into a gentle glide and felt

2669
02:57:12,550 --> 02:57:14,689
the speed pick up again.

2670
02:57:14,689 --> 02:57:17,470
'Good,' George said calmly.

2671
02:57:17,470 --> 02:57:21,750
'Now, where are you going to land?'

2672
02:57:21,750 --> 02:57:24,720
Francesca looked down to the ground far below.

2673
02:57:24,720 --> 02:57:30,619
There was a wood away to the left, then, nearer
to the plane, a series of fields.

2674
02:57:30,619 --> 02:57:35,189
The biggest was a large brown one, just below
the nose.

2675
02:57:35,189 --> 02:57:40,800
'That one,' Francesca replied, pointing with
her free hand.

2676
02:57:40,800 --> 02:57:47,560
'Mmm, I find ploughed fields a bit bumpy to
land on,' George said quietly.

2677
02:57:47,560 --> 02:57:52,669
'Don't you think a grassy one would be better?'

2678
02:57:52,669 --> 02:57:55,410
Francesca immediately felt foolish.

2679
02:57:55,410 --> 02:57:59,669
Brown meant ploughed; green meant grass.

2680
02:57:59,669 --> 02:58:03,050
She couldn't believe she had made such a basic
mistake.

2681
02:58:03,050 --> 02:58:07,780
'Come on, make a decision quickly,' George
said cheerfully.

2682
02:58:07,780 --> 02:58:11,830
'You've already lost 300 feet in height.'

2683
02:58:11,830 --> 02:58:14,720
Francesca looked down in desperation.

2684
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:18,699
Almost directly below there was a long thin
green field.

2685
02:58:18,699 --> 02:58:20,470
'That one, then!'

2686
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:23,129
she said, pointing again.

2687
02:58:23,129 --> 02:58:24,520
George glanced down.

2688
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:26,810
'Your decision,' he said.

2689
02:58:26,810 --> 02:58:29,399
'Now, you need to land into the wind.

2690
02:58:29,399 --> 02:58:32,359
Which way is the wind blowing?'

2691
02:58:32,359 --> 02:58:33,359
Francesca panicked.

2692
02:58:33,359 --> 02:58:36,239
'I can't remember,' she said.

2693
02:58:36,239 --> 02:58:38,890
'Well, look for some smoke!'

2694
02:58:38,890 --> 02:58:41,119
George called.

2695
02:58:41,119 --> 02:58:42,839
Francesca searched the sky.

2696
02:58:42,839 --> 02:58:47,430
Far away to the right she spotted the chimney
of a factory.

2697
02:58:47,430 --> 02:58:50,430
The smoke was blowing towards them.

2698
02:58:50,430 --> 02:58:57,130
That meant, to land in the field below, Francesca
had to fly round in a circle.

2699
02:58:57,130 --> 02:59:01,109
Still disturbed by her mistake, she began
to turn.

2700
02:59:01,109 --> 02:59:04,520
'2300 feet,' George said.

2701
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:09,159
'Right, don't forget your emergency calls!'

2702
02:59:09,159 --> 02:59:11,239
Francesca's mind went blank.

2703
02:59:11,239 --> 02:59:14,239
She couldn't remember a word of what she'd
learnt.

2704
02:59:14,239 --> 02:59:17,369
The panicky feeling in her chest got worse.

2705
02:59:17,369 --> 02:59:20,290
The plane was sinking fast.

2706
02:59:20,290 --> 02:59:23,959
'I can't remember,' she said.

2707
02:59:23,959 --> 02:59:25,270
George reminded her.

2708
02:59:25,270 --> 02:59:28,149
'Mayday, mayday, mayday,' he said.

2709
02:59:28,149 --> 02:59:34,550
'And don't forget this is only a practice,
so don't press the radio button!'

2710
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:36,329
Francesca swallowed hard.

2711
02:59:36,329 --> 02:59:37,329
'Mayday!

2712
02:59:37,329 --> 02:59:38,329
Mayday!

2713
02:59:38,329 --> 02:59:39,329
Mayday!'

2714
02:59:39,329 --> 02:59:42,170
she called, then came to a stop.

2715
02:59:42,170 --> 02:59:44,439
What was she meant to say next?

2716
02:59:44,439 --> 02:59:49,270
She remembered she had to say the details
of the plane and half a dozen other things,

2717
02:59:49,270 --> 02:59:52,500
but everything became confused in her head.

2718
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:54,899
'Sorry,' she said, hopelessly.

2719
02:59:54,899 --> 02:59:59,260
'All right, forget the calls,' George said,
trying to calm her.

2720
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:02,119
'It's more important to land the plane safely.

2721
03:00:02,119 --> 03:00:04,520
You're down to 1500 feet.

2722
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:09,800
You'll have to do a tight turn or you won't
make it to the field.'

2723
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:15,390
Francesca tried to concentrate, but now everything
seemed to be going wrong.

2724
03:00:15,390 --> 03:00:20,459
Unconsciously, she'd been pulling back on
the control column, so the plane was flying

2725
03:00:20,459 --> 03:00:22,489
dangerously slowly.

2726
03:00:22,489 --> 03:00:27,770
All of a sudden the stall-warning alarm sounded.

2727
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:29,629
Francesca froze.

2728
03:00:29,629 --> 03:00:31,600
This time, George didn't wait.

2729
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:34,899
'All right, I have control,' he said.

2730
03:00:34,899 --> 03:00:41,199
At once he reached for his control column
and pushed it forward, at the same time increasing

2731
03:00:41,199 --> 03:00:42,199
the power.

2732
03:00:42,199 --> 03:00:48,159
The plane picked up speed immediately and
after a few moments George took it into a

2733
03:00:48,159 --> 03:00:50,819
steady climb.

2734
03:00:50,819 --> 03:00:53,189
Francesca felt herself going red.

2735
03:00:53,189 --> 03:00:54,779
'I'm sorry,' she said.

2736
03:00:54,779 --> 03:00:57,479
'That was terrible, wasn't it?'

2737
03:00:57,479 --> 03:01:00,410
George gave a tiny nod of the head.

2738
03:01:00,410 --> 03:01:02,789
'Don't worry,' he said.

2739
03:01:02,789 --> 03:01:05,189
'Everyone makes a mess of it the first time.'

2740
03:01:05,189 --> 03:01:08,180
Then he looked across and smiled.

2741
03:01:08,180 --> 03:01:20,709
'Besides, in forty years of flying I haven't
had an engine failure once.'

2742
03:01:20,709 --> 03:01:23,359
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

2743
03:01:23,359 --> 03:01:27,069
Tempting fate

2744
03:01:27,069 --> 03:01:33,159
Whenever Francesca either saw Tom or telephoned
him over the next couple of weeks, she couldn't

2745
03:01:33,159 --> 03:01:37,350
resist the temptation of asking if there was
any news of Doug.

2746
03:01:37,350 --> 03:01:39,119
There was none.

2747
03:01:39,119 --> 03:01:42,729
No one seemed to have any idea where he was.

2748
03:01:42,729 --> 03:01:49,819
A rumour went round the airfield that he'd
gone abroad, but no one could confirm it.

2749
03:01:49,819 --> 03:01:54,999
Whatever the case, the door to the Fastwings
office remained firmly shut and there was

2750
03:01:54,999 --> 03:01:57,960
no sign of his grey Audi.

2751
03:01:57,960 --> 03:02:05,560
Then, one evening when Francesca was at Tom's
flat, he announced that he had some further

2752
03:02:05,560 --> 03:02:06,560
news.

2753
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:12,819
'I heard something else about Doug this morning,
but I'm not sure you'll want to know,' he

2754
03:02:12,819 --> 03:02:14,689
said.

2755
03:02:14,689 --> 03:02:17,109
Francesca felt herself tense up immediately.

2756
03:02:17,109 --> 03:02:21,130
'You'd better tell me,' she said quietly.

2757
03:02:21,130 --> 03:02:28,659
'Well,' Tom went on a little anxiously, 'it
seems that before he came here, when he was

2758
03:02:28,659 --> 03:02:35,289
an instructor down at Southampton, he was
accused of sexually harassing one of his female

2759
03:02:35,289 --> 03:02:36,899
students.

2760
03:02:36,899 --> 03:02:41,699
The woman brought charges against him, but
the case was dropped because she didn't have

2761
03:02:41,699 --> 03:02:44,170
any proof and Doug won damages.

2762
03:02:44,170 --> 03:02:50,060
But I can't believe a woman would go to the
lengths of bringing charges against someone

2763
03:02:50,060 --> 03:02:52,039
unless there was some truth in it.

2764
03:02:52,039 --> 03:02:58,539
And I think you said you always felt very
uncomfortable with him - I just thought that

2765
03:02:58,539 --> 03:03:03,050
might explain why.'

2766
03:03:03,050 --> 03:03:08,220
Francesca had remained silent throughout Tom's
speech and she didn't say anything now.

2767
03:03:08,220 --> 03:03:12,039
She just didn't want to think about Doug.

2768
03:03:12,039 --> 03:03:17,989
'Sorry, perhaps it was a mistake to tell you,'
Tom said, confused.

2769
03:03:17,989 --> 03:03:21,419
'No, it's all right,' she said at last.

2770
03:03:21,419 --> 03:03:26,060
'But I knew the story already.'

2771
03:03:26,060 --> 03:03:27,430
Tom looked very surprised.

2772
03:03:27,430 --> 03:03:31,930
'You knew it?' he said.

2773
03:03:31,930 --> 03:03:33,949
Francesca gave a sigh.

2774
03:03:33,949 --> 03:03:40,060
She didn't understand why she was still so
unwilling to talk about it, but she was.

2775
03:03:40,060 --> 03:03:47,810
With difficulty, she began, 'About a month
ago, I searched for Doug on the Internet and

2776
03:03:47,810 --> 03:03:50,909
I found a newspaper report about him.

2777
03:03:50,909 --> 03:03:54,319
It's one of the reasons why I decided to leave
Fastwings.'

2778
03:03:54,319 --> 03:03:58,419
'I'm not surprised,' Tom said quickly.

2779
03:03:58,419 --> 03:04:02,989
'I hope he didn't try anything like that with
you.'

2780
03:04:02,989 --> 03:04:04,569
Francesca bit her lip.

2781
03:04:04,569 --> 03:04:08,489
'Well, actually, he did,' she said.

2782
03:04:08,489 --> 03:04:11,560
'That's the other reason I had to leave.'

2783
03:04:11,560 --> 03:04:12,720
'What?!'

2784
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:14,960
Tom cried.

2785
03:04:14,960 --> 03:04:17,399
Francesca felt sick again.

2786
03:04:17,399 --> 03:04:22,300
'He used to keep putting his hand on my leg
and touching me,' she said.

2787
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:28,649
'It was horrible - and he kept saying things,
making sort of sexual suggestions.

2788
03:04:28,649 --> 03:04:31,430
It was disgusting...'

2789
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:38,270
Just as Francesca had guessed, Tom was furious
and over the next five minutes Francesca was

2790
03:04:38,270 --> 03:04:41,789
forced to relate all that had happened in
the flying lessons.

2791
03:04:41,789 --> 03:04:48,959
The memory of it all only brought Francesca's
misery back, and, on the point of tears, she

2792
03:04:48,959 --> 03:04:51,460
said she wanted to think about something else.

2793
03:04:51,460 --> 03:04:57,189
At least Tom had the sensitivity not to press
her any further.

2794
03:04:57,189 --> 03:05:02,729
Saying how sorry he was, and all the things
he would do if he ever saw Doug again, he

2795
03:05:02,729 --> 03:05:04,879
finished with a shake of his head.

2796
03:05:04,879 --> 03:05:11,890
'What I don't understand is how he ever got
an instructor's licence,' he said.

2797
03:05:11,890 --> 03:05:14,290
'Yes,' Francesca murmured.

2798
03:05:14,290 --> 03:05:19,810
'Well, at least it's all over and you're safe
now.'

2799
03:05:19,810 --> 03:05:21,750
Francesca didn't say anything.

2800
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:33,119
For some reason, she hadn't been able to bring
herself to tell Tom about any of Doug's threats.

2801
03:05:33,119 --> 03:05:34,119
***

2802
03:05:34,119 --> 03:05:35,939
Francesca's next few lessons were much more
successful.

2803
03:05:35,939 --> 03:05:42,529
She managed some difficult crosswind landings
very well and her confidence returned.

2804
03:05:42,529 --> 03:05:49,079
So the lesson after that George made her try
another PFL.

2805
03:05:49,079 --> 03:05:55,260
This time Francesca was much more focused,
choosing a landing field quickly, noting the

2806
03:05:55,260 --> 03:05:58,920
direction of the wind and turning the plane
well.

2807
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:05,669
The emergency calls didn't go so well, but
more importantly, as they glided down, it

2808
03:06:05,669 --> 03:06:11,569
soon became clear that the field Francesca
had selected was not a good choice.

2809
03:06:11,569 --> 03:06:16,590
A telephone line stretched from one side of
the field to the other.

2810
03:06:16,590 --> 03:06:22,239
If she'd attempted to land she would have
hit the wire for certain, and probably buried

2811
03:06:22,239 --> 03:06:25,209
the plane deep in the earth.

2812
03:06:25,209 --> 03:06:30,919
Nevertheless, when they'd returned to Norwich
and were back in the Flying Start office,

2813
03:06:30,919 --> 03:06:37,079
George announced that the following Tuesday
he wanted Francesca to do her 'cross country

2814
03:06:37,079 --> 03:06:38,079
flight'.

2815
03:06:38,079 --> 03:06:40,220
'What does that mean?'

2816
03:06:40,220 --> 03:06:41,220
Francesca asked.

2817
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:48,409
'It means you fly solo, landing at two different
airfields before you return here.'

2818
03:06:48,409 --> 03:06:49,909
George grinned.

2819
03:06:49,909 --> 03:06:59,060
'This is the last big flight before you do
your final flying exam.'

2820
03:06:59,060 --> 03:07:00,060
***

2821
03:07:00,060 --> 03:07:03,090
Francesca couldn't believe how much planning
was involved in such a flight.

2822
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:10,539
George had told her she was to fly to Leicester,
then Peterborough and finally back to Norwich.

2823
03:07:10,539 --> 03:07:17,959
So she examined maps, learning the route and
areas to be avoided, then studied information

2824
03:07:17,959 --> 03:07:19,249
about the airfields.

2825
03:07:19,249 --> 03:07:25,789
There were other things to consider, too:
the fuel she needed to take, the radio calls

2826
03:07:25,789 --> 03:07:28,079
she'd have to make.

2827
03:07:28,079 --> 03:07:33,260
When she went to bed the night before the
flight, her brain was full of a million facts

2828
03:07:33,260 --> 03:07:39,640
and figures all competing for a place in her
head.

2829
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:44,739
Francesca woke on the Tuesday morning with
an uncomfortable feeling.

2830
03:07:44,739 --> 03:07:51,560
It was a curious sensation: nothing precise,
just the sort of feeling that a bad dream

2831
03:07:51,560 --> 03:07:56,220
sometimes leaves, a sort of shadow cast over
the day.

2832
03:07:56,220 --> 03:08:02,899
She got up and pulled open the curtains, determined
to forget the feeling.

2833
03:08:02,899 --> 03:08:08,560
The weather was quite windy, but bright and
clear, which meant good visibility.

2834
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:15,169
That was a relief: nothing would have been
worse than discovering the flight was off.

2835
03:08:15,169 --> 03:08:21,749
Mrs Thompson had given her the whole day off
and Tom had promised to come and pick her

2836
03:08:21,749 --> 03:08:27,879
up, so at ten-thirty, Francesca was waiting
at her window, ready to leave.

2837
03:08:27,879 --> 03:08:32,439
It was then that she saw the grey Audi.

2838
03:08:32,439 --> 03:08:40,550
It crept slowly past the entrance to the drive,
disappeared, then reappeared on the other

2839
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:45,430
side of the road half a minute later and stopped.

2840
03:08:45,430 --> 03:08:48,499
Francesca's heart sank.

2841
03:08:48,499 --> 03:08:50,420
Doug was back.

2842
03:08:50,420 --> 03:08:52,959
She was certain of it.

2843
03:08:52,959 --> 03:08:56,229
She drew back from the window and collapsed
onto the bed.

2844
03:08:56,229 --> 03:08:59,819
Her hands tore at her hair in misery.

2845
03:08:59,819 --> 03:09:00,819
'Why!

2846
03:09:00,819 --> 03:09:01,819
Why!

2847
03:09:01,819 --> 03:09:02,819
Why!'

2848
03:09:02,819 --> 03:09:06,010
she thought, 'Why can't he leave me alone!'

2849
03:09:06,010 --> 03:09:11,669
She sat there, trying to fight her fears,
trying to fight against the feeling that her

2850
03:09:11,669 --> 03:09:14,399
heart was going to explode.

2851
03:09:14,399 --> 03:09:20,539
Then the next moment, full of anger, she jumped
up, determined to settle matters with the

2852
03:09:20,539 --> 03:09:22,630
man once and for all.

2853
03:09:22,630 --> 03:09:26,989
She raced down the stairs, pulled open the
front door angrily, and marched out into the

2854
03:09:26,989 --> 03:09:27,989
drive.

2855
03:09:27,989 --> 03:09:32,069
But the Audi was no longer there.

2856
03:09:32,069 --> 03:09:36,989
It had disappeared completely.

2857
03:09:36,989 --> 03:09:40,640
A couple of seconds later, Tom's car pulled
into the drive and stopped.

2858
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:46,789
'Today's the day!' he said cheerfully, climbing
out of the driver's door.

2859
03:09:46,789 --> 03:09:54,520
Then, seeing Francesca's face, he asked, 'Hey,
are you all right?'

2860
03:09:54,520 --> 03:09:56,659
Francesca stood still on the spot.

2861
03:09:56,659 --> 03:10:02,959
A sentence about Doug being back formed in
her mouth, but wouldn't come out.

2862
03:10:02,959 --> 03:10:09,689
Somehow, it seemed as long as she didn't say
it, it wouldn't be true.

2863
03:10:09,689 --> 03:10:13,720
'Fine,' she answered quietly.

2864
03:10:13,720 --> 03:10:17,339
On the way to the airfield, her spirits began
to rise.

2865
03:10:17,339 --> 03:10:20,579
Perhaps she'd got it wrong after all.

2866
03:10:20,579 --> 03:10:26,729
She couldn't actually be certain it was Doug's
car - maybe it was someone else's car.

2867
03:10:26,729 --> 03:10:29,989
Just a simple mistake.

2868
03:10:29,989 --> 03:10:35,300
She rested her head back and tried to relax.

2869
03:10:35,300 --> 03:10:38,129
George was already waiting in the office when
they arrived.

2870
03:10:38,129 --> 03:10:42,229
He gave a slight frown as Francesca walked
in.

2871
03:10:42,229 --> 03:10:46,449
'Everything all right?' he asked, looking
at her closely.

2872
03:10:46,449 --> 03:10:50,180
'Of course,' Francesca answered.

2873
03:10:50,180 --> 03:10:52,279
George didn't seem convinced.

2874
03:10:52,279 --> 03:10:54,520
'Sure?' he asked.

2875
03:10:54,520 --> 03:11:00,489
'Well, a bit nervous, I guess,' Francesca
said.

2876
03:11:00,489 --> 03:11:04,199
George nodded, apparently satisfied with the
response.

2877
03:11:04,199 --> 03:11:07,669
'Well, that'll keep you focused,' he said.

2878
03:11:07,669 --> 03:11:13,109
'Right, I've printed out the weather report
for you, so Tom and I will leave you to get

2879
03:11:13,109 --> 03:11:15,140
down to the final planning now.'

2880
03:11:15,140 --> 03:11:20,100
Francesca tried to settle at the desk.

2881
03:11:20,100 --> 03:11:25,249
She stared at the weather report George had
given her, but none of the lines and numbers

2882
03:11:25,249 --> 03:11:28,569
printed there meant anything to her.

2883
03:11:28,569 --> 03:11:33,000
All she could see was Doug's car, creeping
along the road.

2884
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:38,319
The panicky feeling rose in her chest again
as she tried to get the picture out of her

2885
03:11:38,319 --> 03:11:39,319
head.

2886
03:11:39,319 --> 03:11:45,600
Today of all days, she told herself, she really
couldn't afford to have anything else in her

2887
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:48,359
mind except the cross-country flight.

2888
03:11:48,359 --> 03:11:55,120
It would need all of her concentration - not
simply flying the plane, but all the other

2889
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:58,299
tasks, too.

2890
03:11:58,299 --> 03:12:00,789
Fifteen minutes later, George came back.

2891
03:12:00,789 --> 03:12:05,010
'How's it going?' he asked.

2892
03:12:05,010 --> 03:12:09,930
Francesca showed him her flight plan - all
the rows of figures she'd prepared.

2893
03:12:09,930 --> 03:12:14,609
George studied it for a short time, then looked
at her.

2894
03:12:14,609 --> 03:12:17,600
'Not bad,' he said.

2895
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:20,020
'Except for one small point.

2896
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:22,789
Which way is the wind blowing today?'

2897
03:12:22,789 --> 03:12:27,590
'West to east,' Francesca replied.

2898
03:12:27,590 --> 03:12:31,439
'You've calculated everything east to west.

2899
03:12:31,439 --> 03:12:36,609
Following this flight plan, you'd end up in
the middle of the North Sea.'

2900
03:12:36,609 --> 03:12:40,229
He gave her a friendly smile and left.

2901
03:12:40,229 --> 03:12:43,459
Francesca buried her head in her hands.

2902
03:12:43,459 --> 03:12:49,799
Twenty minutes later, after Francesca had
corrected her error, and George had approved

2903
03:12:49,799 --> 03:12:52,640
the plan, they left the office.

2904
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:59,299
The Flying Start Cessna was already outside
the hangar, its blue and white paintwork shining

2905
03:12:59,299 --> 03:13:01,619
brightly in the sun.

2906
03:13:01,619 --> 03:13:05,100
Tom was cleaning the windscreen.

2907
03:13:05,100 --> 03:13:10,101
Francesca walked around the plane, looking
over the body, the tyres and the lights, doing

2908
03:13:10,101 --> 03:13:12,010
an oil-check.

2909
03:13:12,010 --> 03:13:17,289
The fuel didn't need checking for water since
the plane had already been flown that morning,

2910
03:13:17,289 --> 03:13:20,689
but it needed filling up.

2911
03:13:20,689 --> 03:13:23,960
She and Tom dragged the aircraft over to the
fuel tank.

2912
03:13:23,960 --> 03:13:29,249
'For the flight you're doing, you'll need
it filled right up to maximum.'

2913
03:13:29,249 --> 03:13:30,249
Tom said.

2914
03:13:30,249 --> 03:13:33,199
'If you operate the pump, I'll take the fuel-line.'

2915
03:13:33,199 --> 03:13:38,930
'It's OK, I'll do it,' Francesca said.

2916
03:13:38,930 --> 03:13:44,120
Taking the end of the fuel-line, she climbed
up onto the wing, and opened the fuel-cap.

2917
03:13:44,120 --> 03:13:50,310
Soon, with Tom at the pump, fuel was pouring
into the tank.

2918
03:13:50,310 --> 03:13:56,270
When it was full, Francesca took the line
and climbed up onto the other wing.

2919
03:13:56,270 --> 03:14:01,869
'Stop,' she called, when the fuel reached
the maximum point.

2920
03:14:01,869 --> 03:14:03,680
Tom gave a small frown.

2921
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:06,029
'That's funny,' he said.

2922
03:14:06,029 --> 03:14:07,029
'Why?'

2923
03:14:07,029 --> 03:14:08,289
Francesca asked.

2924
03:14:08,289 --> 03:14:12,790
'I thought she'd take a couple more litres
than that.'

2925
03:14:12,790 --> 03:14:14,039
He thought for a minute.

2926
03:14:14,039 --> 03:14:19,760
'Oh well, I suppose I must have noted down
the wrong figures after the last flight yesterday.

2927
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:23,199
Not to worry.'

2928
03:14:23,199 --> 03:14:26,619
Francesca double-checked the levels, then
climbed down.

2929
03:14:26,619 --> 03:14:27,619
'Right.

2930
03:14:27,619 --> 03:14:29,470
Are you all ready?'

2931
03:14:29,470 --> 03:14:30,580
Tom said cheerfully.

2932
03:14:30,580 --> 03:14:33,949
'I think so,' Francesca answered.

2933
03:14:33,949 --> 03:14:36,890
'Good luck, then,' Tom replied.

2934
03:14:36,890 --> 03:14:41,229
He leant across and gave Francesca a brief
kiss on the cheek.

2935
03:14:41,229 --> 03:14:48,050
'See you in about five hours' time,' he whispered
in her ear.

2936
03:14:48,050 --> 03:14:49,369
Francesca didn't say anything.

2937
03:14:49,369 --> 03:15:00,209
For some reason it felt too much like tempting
fate.

2938
03:15:00,209 --> 03:15:02,270
CHAPTER NINETEEN

2939
03:15:02,270 --> 03:15:03,270
One chance

2940
03:15:03,270 --> 03:15:13,010
Francesca climbed into the cockpit, settled
into the seat and did up her safety harness.

2941
03:15:13,010 --> 03:15:19,249
Then she arranged the flight plan on her knee
and put the map on the other seat.

2942
03:15:19,249 --> 03:15:25,930
Satisfied with all that, she called to Tom
to stand clear, and started the engine.

2943
03:15:25,930 --> 03:15:31,829
When that was running smoothly, she put on
the headphones and tuned in the radio to Norwich

2944
03:15:31,829 --> 03:15:32,939
Control Tower.

2945
03:15:32,939 --> 03:15:38,409
'Norwich Tower, this is Golf Lima Yankee,'
she called.

2946
03:15:38,409 --> 03:15:40,989
The tower called back.

2947
03:15:40,989 --> 03:15:46,489
Francesca announced that she was going to
go round to the runway, then she released

2948
03:15:46,489 --> 03:15:51,379
the brakes and the aircraft began to move
forward.

2949
03:15:51,379 --> 03:15:58,590
Tom gave her a firm thumbs-up sign, and watched
as she began to move away.

2950
03:15:58,590 --> 03:16:04,299
As she went round past the hangars, Francesca's
confidence began to grow again.

2951
03:16:04,299 --> 03:16:11,220
Even if it was Doug she'd seen that morning,
she was safe now - he couldn't reach her.

2952
03:16:11,220 --> 03:16:17,399
With the Fastwings Cessna out of action, locked
away in the hangar, he couldn't come swooping

2953
03:16:17,399 --> 03:16:20,799
out of the sky as he had done previously.

2954
03:16:20,799 --> 03:16:24,439
She could forget about Doug.

2955
03:16:24,439 --> 03:16:29,270
Focusing her mind on the flight ahead, she
stopped before the start of the runway, and

2956
03:16:29,270 --> 03:16:32,220
began the power checks.

2957
03:16:32,220 --> 03:16:37,840
First she ran the engine up to full power,
then let it drop back to almost nothing, making

2958
03:16:37,840 --> 03:16:39,919
sure that it didn't cut out.

2959
03:16:39,919 --> 03:16:46,449
Happy with that, she checked all the controls,
moving the control column around, noting that

2960
03:16:46,449 --> 03:16:50,169
there was full and free movement.

2961
03:16:50,169 --> 03:16:52,589
Then she made the next radio call.

2962
03:16:52,589 --> 03:16:59,419
'Norwich Tower, Golf Lima Yankee is ready
to line up runway zero nine.'

2963
03:16:59,419 --> 03:17:07,289
'Golf Lima Yankee,' the call came back, 'You
are cleared for take-off runway zero nine.'

2964
03:17:07,289 --> 03:17:10,050
Francesca felt her heart beating faster.

2965
03:17:10,050 --> 03:17:15,729
She released the brakes and, using the throttle
carefully, powered the small aircraft onto

2966
03:17:15,729 --> 03:17:19,260
the piano keys at the start of the runway.

2967
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:21,779
Then she waited there for a moment.

2968
03:17:21,779 --> 03:17:24,799
This was the critical time.

2969
03:17:24,799 --> 03:17:30,010
When she pushed in the throttle she would
begin the take-off run, and then would come

2970
03:17:30,010 --> 03:17:32,629
the point of no return.

2971
03:17:32,629 --> 03:17:38,550
If she was going to change her mind, it had
to be now.

2972
03:17:38,550 --> 03:17:45,699
She hesitated for perhaps three seconds, then
actually spoke out loud in English, 'Come

2973
03:17:45,699 --> 03:17:46,699
on!

2974
03:17:46,699 --> 03:17:47,699
Don't be such a coward!'

2975
03:17:47,699 --> 03:17:54,770
The next moment she'd pushed in the throttle
and already the little Cessna had started

2976
03:17:54,770 --> 03:17:56,039
moving.

2977
03:17:56,039 --> 03:17:58,689
The speed picked up fast.

2978
03:17:58,689 --> 03:18:02,659
Francesca's eyes moved quickly between the
dials and the runway ahead.

2979
03:18:02,659 --> 03:18:10,029
A faint smile spread across her face, then
before she realised she'd made the decision,

2980
03:18:10,029 --> 03:18:15,979
she had already pulled back on the control
column and the plane was in the air.

2981
03:18:15,979 --> 03:18:21,020
Holding the nose down, she put the aircraft
into a climb.

2982
03:18:21,020 --> 03:18:27,910
Soon the first five hundred feet were passed,
and the airfield was left behind.

2983
03:18:27,910 --> 03:18:33,169
She was out over fields, climbing steadily
towards the clouds high up above.

2984
03:18:33,169 --> 03:18:40,659
And as she flew, she began to feel that familiar
sense of release - that sensation she had

2985
03:18:40,659 --> 03:18:43,260
whenever she was in the air now.

2986
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:49,749
It was one of complete freedom, a kind of
divorce from ordinary life, a belief that

2987
03:18:49,749 --> 03:18:54,119
she was part of a completely different world
from that of the Earth.

2988
03:18:54,119 --> 03:19:00,810
At 1000 feet, she began to turn the plane
until she was flying in the correct direction

2989
03:19:00,810 --> 03:19:02,390
towards Leicester.

2990
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:09,149
Looking down, she checked for the things she
should see: a railway line entering a large

2991
03:19:09,149 --> 03:19:10,149
wood.

2992
03:19:10,149 --> 03:19:11,379
It was there.

2993
03:19:11,379 --> 03:19:14,629
She was exactly on course.

2994
03:19:14,629 --> 03:19:20,279
She wasn't even a minute into the flight when
the radio call came.

2995
03:19:20,279 --> 03:19:21,850
'Golf Lima Yankee.

2996
03:19:21,850 --> 03:19:24,439
This is Norwich Tower.'

2997
03:19:24,439 --> 03:19:27,419
'Golf Lima Yankee,' she called back.

2998
03:19:27,419 --> 03:19:29,799
'Golf Lima Yankee.

2999
03:19:29,799 --> 03:19:33,449
Return to Norwich immediately!'

3000
03:19:33,449 --> 03:19:35,789
Francesca couldn't believe her ears.

3001
03:19:35,789 --> 03:19:40,359
Forgetting her radio language she asked, 'What
was that?'

3002
03:19:40,359 --> 03:19:44,050
The call was returned instantly.

3003
03:19:44,050 --> 03:19:48,689
'Golf Lima Yankee, you must return to the
airfield immediately.

3004
03:19:48,689 --> 03:19:53,999
We have been informed that there is water
in your fuel and you are in serious danger

3005
03:19:53,999 --> 03:19:57,569
of engine failure!'

3006
03:19:57,569 --> 03:20:00,409
Francesca felt her blood run cold.

3007
03:20:00,409 --> 03:20:01,689
'Pardon?'

3008
03:20:01,689 --> 03:20:02,720
she said faintly.

3009
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:07,890
'Golf Lima Yankee, you are in danger of engine
failure.

3010
03:20:07,890 --> 03:20:09,489
Return to Norwich immediately.

3011
03:20:09,489 --> 03:20:11,209
Do you understand?'

3012
03:20:11,209 --> 03:20:13,779
Weakly, Francesca answered.

3013
03:20:13,779 --> 03:20:16,760
'Yes, I understand.'

3014
03:20:16,760 --> 03:20:20,209
With staring eyes, she began to turn the plane
round.

3015
03:20:20,209 --> 03:20:23,619
A hand seemed to be gripping her throat.

3016
03:20:23,619 --> 03:20:25,419
She could hardly breathe.

3017
03:20:25,419 --> 03:20:27,709
Of course, it was Doug.

3018
03:20:27,709 --> 03:20:31,550
He had somehow put water in the fuel tank.

3019
03:20:31,550 --> 03:20:36,239
If it reached the engine, the engine was certain
to stop.

3020
03:20:36,239 --> 03:20:39,119
Another call came through.

3021
03:20:39,119 --> 03:20:42,050
'Golf Lima Yankee, please state your height
and position.'

3022
03:20:42,050 --> 03:20:47,770
Francesca stared at the map, at the dials,
down at the ground.

3023
03:20:47,770 --> 03:20:50,710
For a moment, she was in total confusion.

3024
03:20:50,710 --> 03:20:52,279
Then she called back.

3025
03:20:52,279 --> 03:20:56,249
'Norwich Tower,' she said slowly.

3026
03:20:56,249 --> 03:21:03,359
'Golf Lima Yankee is at 3000 feet, overhead
Branton Wood, heading zero eight zero.'

3027
03:21:03,359 --> 03:21:08,999
'Very good, Golf Lima Yankee,' the tower answered.

3028
03:21:08,999 --> 03:21:11,799
'Emergency Services are standing by at Norwich.

3029
03:21:11,799 --> 03:21:16,079
You have priority for landing.'

3030
03:21:16,079 --> 03:21:21,310
Francesca had no time to take in what had
happened, for almost at the same moment, the

3031
03:21:21,310 --> 03:21:27,790
engine coughed like an old man, went back
to full power for a second or two, then stopped

3032
03:21:27,790 --> 03:21:30,609
completely.

3033
03:21:30,609 --> 03:21:31,919
Francesca froze.

3034
03:21:31,919 --> 03:21:34,170
She couldn't move, she couldn't speak.

3035
03:21:34,170 --> 03:21:36,770
Then it hit her.

3036
03:21:36,770 --> 03:21:38,789
This was real.

3037
03:21:38,789 --> 03:21:41,419
She had to act.

3038
03:21:41,419 --> 03:21:47,319
She blinked a couple of times as if suddenly
waking up, then a new Francesca seemed to

3039
03:21:47,319 --> 03:21:49,869
slip into the seat.

3040
03:21:49,869 --> 03:21:54,699
Immediately she pushed the control column
forward and put the plane into a glide.

3041
03:21:54,699 --> 03:21:59,539
And then she was looking down through the
left-hand window to the earth beneath.

3042
03:21:59,539 --> 03:22:06,069
Fortunately, she had just left the woodland
behind and there was a choice of fields below.

3043
03:22:06,069 --> 03:22:11,720
A large green rectangular one caught her eye,
but a thin wavy line through the middle of

3044
03:22:11,720 --> 03:22:14,089
it suggested a small stream.

3045
03:22:14,089 --> 03:22:21,229
A little way ahead, Francesca spotted another
field, paler green this time - it would have

3046
03:22:21,229 --> 03:22:22,489
to be that one.

3047
03:22:22,489 --> 03:22:26,289
She tried to work out which way she would
land.

3048
03:22:26,289 --> 03:22:31,350
She'd taken off to the west, now she was flying
back in the opposite direction, so she must

3049
03:22:31,350 --> 03:22:33,489
be flying east.

3050
03:22:33,489 --> 03:22:39,369
If she was going to land into the wind, it
meant turning 180 degrees.

3051
03:22:39,369 --> 03:22:44,859
She would have to make a wide circle round,
but make sure she didn't come in short.

3052
03:22:44,859 --> 03:22:49,430
If she did, there were trees and a ploughed
field - she would crash into these.

3053
03:22:49,430 --> 03:22:50,729
'Norwich Tower.

3054
03:22:50,729 --> 03:22:51,729
Mayday!

3055
03:22:51,729 --> 03:22:52,729
Mayday!

3056
03:22:52,729 --> 03:22:53,729
Mayday!

3057
03:22:53,729 --> 03:22:57,090
Golf Lima Yankee has engine failure,' she
called.

3058
03:22:57,090 --> 03:23:01,270
'Attempting forced landing just east of Branton
Wood.'

3059
03:23:01,270 --> 03:23:06,370
'Golf Lima Yankee,' the call came back, 'Emergency
call understood.

3060
03:23:06,370 --> 03:23:09,250
Forced landing east of Branton Wood.

3061
03:23:09,250 --> 03:23:11,210
Good luck.'

3062
03:23:11,210 --> 03:23:13,119
Francesca didn't answer.

3063
03:23:13,119 --> 03:23:15,699
Already the plane was down to 1500 feet.

3064
03:23:15,699 --> 03:23:21,579
She was over the middle of the field she had
chosen - now she had to fly on and circle

3065
03:23:21,579 --> 03:23:24,640
round to come into land.

3066
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:27,149
Another cough from the engine caught her by
surprise.

3067
03:23:27,149 --> 03:23:29,260
Somehow, it must have restarted.

3068
03:23:29,260 --> 03:23:34,140
Maybe she would be able to fly on, after all;
perhaps there was hope!

3069
03:23:34,140 --> 03:23:40,020
But as suddenly as the engine had restarted,
it stopped again.

3070
03:23:40,020 --> 03:23:41,539
Francesca swore.

3071
03:23:41,539 --> 03:23:45,350
It would have been better if it hadn't restarted
at all.

3072
03:23:45,350 --> 03:23:48,140
She had to concentrate.

3073
03:23:48,140 --> 03:23:49,909
Concentrate like never before.

3074
03:23:49,909 --> 03:23:52,029
1000 feet.

3075
03:23:52,029 --> 03:23:53,680
She should begin the turn.

3076
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:57,039
There were trees beneath, and a road.

3077
03:23:57,039 --> 03:24:00,989
She could see a small white car racing along.

3078
03:24:00,989 --> 03:24:06,249
Francesca imagined the driver happily speeding
on, completely unaware of the drama taking

3079
03:24:06,249 --> 03:24:07,960
place overhead.

3080
03:24:07,960 --> 03:24:10,430
Now five hundred feet.

3081
03:24:10,430 --> 03:24:13,749
So, turn towards the field now.

3082
03:24:13,749 --> 03:24:14,999
Keep up speed.

3083
03:24:14,999 --> 03:24:20,899
Oh, God, Francesca thought, I'll never make
it, it's too far ahead.

3084
03:24:20,899 --> 03:24:22,369
She dropped the nose.

3085
03:24:22,369 --> 03:24:25,470
The ground was getting closer with every second.

3086
03:24:25,470 --> 03:24:27,689
And the trees.

3087
03:24:27,689 --> 03:24:32,029
Unconsciously her hand went to the throttle
to get more power, before she remembered there

3088
03:24:32,029 --> 03:24:35,140
was no power, the engine had failed.

3089
03:24:35,140 --> 03:24:36,250
'Stupid!'

3090
03:24:36,250 --> 03:24:38,409
she shouted out loud.

3091
03:24:38,409 --> 03:24:40,829
She looked ahead, down the nose.

3092
03:24:40,829 --> 03:24:43,510
The field was approaching.

3093
03:24:43,510 --> 03:24:44,869
There was nothing for it.

3094
03:24:44,869 --> 03:24:46,140
This was it.

3095
03:24:46,140 --> 03:24:48,380
One chance to land.

3096
03:24:48,380 --> 03:24:49,810
One chance to live!

3097
03:24:49,810 --> 03:24:51,789
'Here we go!

3098
03:24:51,789 --> 03:24:53,430
Come on, Francesca!'

3099
03:24:53,430 --> 03:24:54,760
she said.

3100
03:24:54,760 --> 03:25:00,089
She thought of her family: of her mother and
father and sister, and Tom.

3101
03:25:00,089 --> 03:25:02,779
This is for you, she thought.

3102
03:25:02,779 --> 03:25:06,529
All of a sudden the ground was rushing past.

3103
03:25:06,529 --> 03:25:12,790
The pale green suddenly formed into a line
of balls; she pulled back on the control column.

3104
03:25:12,790 --> 03:25:17,079
The plane hung in the air for a moment or
two, then dropped.

3105
03:25:17,079 --> 03:25:22,899
With a heavy bump, it came down to the ground,
all three wheels hitting the earth at the

3106
03:25:22,899 --> 03:25:24,680
same time.

3107
03:25:24,680 --> 03:25:30,189
Just before it stopped, the plane suddenly
dug into the earth and dropped forward onto

3108
03:25:30,189 --> 03:25:32,409
its nose.

3109
03:25:32,409 --> 03:25:38,729
Francesca was thrown tight against the safety
harness, then back against the seat.

3110
03:25:38,729 --> 03:25:44,220
It took her four or five seconds to realise
she wasn't moving any more.

3111
03:25:44,220 --> 03:25:48,729
She looked around, unable to understand what
she was seeing.

3112
03:25:48,729 --> 03:25:55,479
Then she realised that lettuces were pressed
up all around the window.

3113
03:25:55,479 --> 03:26:00,149
She had landed in a lettuce field.

3114
03:26:00,149 --> 03:26:04,600
Through her headphones, she heard a call.

3115
03:26:04,600 --> 03:26:06,300
'Golf Lima Yankee?'

3116
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:12,449
'Norwich Tower, this is Golf Lima Yankee,'
she said.

3117
03:26:12,449 --> 03:26:16,819
'I am safely down on the ground.'

3118
03:26:16,819 --> 03:26:27,880
The next moment she burst into tears of relief.

3119
03:26:27,880 --> 03:26:28,880
CHAPTER TWENTY

3120
03:26:28,880 --> 03:26:33,949
A final test

3121
03:26:33,949 --> 03:26:39,640
Three hours later, having left the Cessna
in the temporary care of a very surprised

3122
03:26:39,640 --> 03:26:45,720
farmer, Francesca was taken by police back
to the airfield at Norwich.

3123
03:26:45,720 --> 03:26:52,699
'So, you're telling me Doug put water in my
fuel and then he was the one who telephoned

3124
03:26:52,699 --> 03:26:54,960
the control tower?'

3125
03:26:54,960 --> 03:26:56,749
Francesca said.

3126
03:26:56,749 --> 03:27:03,579
She was back in the Flying Start office with
Tom and George, gripping a cup of coffee tightly.

3127
03:27:03,579 --> 03:27:06,819
'Yes,' Tom answered miserably.

3128
03:27:06,819 --> 03:27:10,999
'I should have known there was something up
when we couldn't get those other two litres

3129
03:27:10,999 --> 03:27:12,279
of fuel in the tank.

3130
03:27:12,279 --> 03:27:16,420
I don't know what to say Francesca; it's my
fault.'

3131
03:27:16,420 --> 03:27:19,520
'Rubbish,' George broke in.

3132
03:27:19,520 --> 03:27:23,249
'There's only one person to blame, and it's
not you.

3133
03:27:23,249 --> 03:27:26,220
Just get on with the story.'

3134
03:27:26,220 --> 03:27:30,910
Tom hesitated for a moment, then continued.

3135
03:27:30,910 --> 03:27:37,359
'Well, it seems Doug was sitting in his car
up here at the airfield, when he saw you going

3136
03:27:37,359 --> 03:27:43,270
past, and suddenly he realised the seriousness
of what he'd done.

3137
03:27:43,270 --> 03:27:47,749
He claims he never imagined you'd even get
as far as the runway - that the engine would

3138
03:27:47,749 --> 03:27:52,039
cut out long before take-off and he just wanted
to scare you.

3139
03:27:52,039 --> 03:27:58,390
But when you went past it was like waking
from a dream; he realised you might actually

3140
03:27:58,390 --> 03:28:01,840
die and that he would be responsible for murder.

3141
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:09,350
Apparently, he called the control tower from
his mobile just as you were taking off.'

3142
03:28:09,350 --> 03:28:14,689
Francesca shook her head in disbelief, and
gripped her cup of coffee even tighter.

3143
03:28:14,689 --> 03:28:21,279
'And then he gave himself up to the police,'
she said quietly.

3144
03:28:21,279 --> 03:28:23,449
'Yes,' Tom replied.

3145
03:28:23,449 --> 03:28:29,319
'Once he'd called the control tower, he phoned
the police himself and just sat in his car

3146
03:28:29,319 --> 03:28:30,600
until they arrived.

3147
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:33,239
He made no attempt to get away.'

3148
03:28:33,239 --> 03:28:35,079
Francesca shivered.

3149
03:28:35,079 --> 03:28:39,450
'The poor guy,' she said quietly.

3150
03:28:39,450 --> 03:28:41,729
'He really must be ill.'

3151
03:28:41,729 --> 03:28:45,510
'Insane, more like it,' George broke in.

3152
03:28:45,510 --> 03:28:49,930
'They should lock him up and throw away the
key.'

3153
03:28:49,930 --> 03:28:54,350
Francesca smiled, touched by the anger that
her instructor was showing.

3154
03:28:54,350 --> 03:29:01,069
George reminded her of her grandfather, who,
although the kindest and gentlest of men,

3155
03:29:01,069 --> 03:29:05,709
would be furious at any mistreatment of a
family member.

3156
03:29:05,709 --> 03:29:07,970
She tried to change the subject.

3157
03:29:07,970 --> 03:29:12,279
'So, why didn't the engine stop immediately?'

3158
03:29:12,279 --> 03:29:17,549
'Ah,' said George, 'that's the remarkable
thing.'

3159
03:29:17,549 --> 03:29:18,910
He sat up.

3160
03:29:18,910 --> 03:29:26,959
'The point is this: at some time today after
its first flight, the stupid fool got to the

3161
03:29:26,959 --> 03:29:31,470
aircraft and poured a couple of litres of
water into one of the tanks.

3162
03:29:31,470 --> 03:29:39,260
Now, as you know, fuel floats on water, so
with the tank up on the wing, the water would

3163
03:29:39,260 --> 03:29:41,850
feed very quickly into the engine.

3164
03:29:41,850 --> 03:29:48,430
However, there would have already been some
fuel in the system, so clearly in driving

3165
03:29:48,430 --> 03:29:55,289
round and taking off, you used up that fuel,
and only a minute later the water got in.

3166
03:29:55,289 --> 03:29:59,479
Then, the engine stopped!'

3167
03:29:59,479 --> 03:30:01,760
Francesca half understood.

3168
03:30:01,760 --> 03:30:06,550
If she was totally honest, she wasn't fully
listening.

3169
03:30:06,550 --> 03:30:12,180
Every now and then, the true horror of what
had happened hit her again.

3170
03:30:12,180 --> 03:30:18,659
She'd been closer to death than at any time
before in her life - at that moment, she might

3171
03:30:18,659 --> 03:30:22,779
be lying dead in a field inside a broken plane.

3172
03:30:22,779 --> 03:30:24,199
She shivered once again.

3173
03:30:24,199 --> 03:30:30,439
'I just hope the bloody fool hasn't put you
off flying,' George went on.

3174
03:30:30,439 --> 03:30:35,430
'Most experienced pilots wouldn't have made
a better forced landing than you did.

3175
03:30:35,430 --> 03:30:40,699
You've got a brilliant flying future ahead
of you.'

3176
03:30:40,699 --> 03:30:46,169
In spite of everything, Francesca felt a glow
of warmth at George's remark.

3177
03:30:46,169 --> 03:30:54,430
But then, all of a sudden, she imagined her
next flight - later that week, next week,

3178
03:30:54,430 --> 03:30:58,979
whenever it might be - and she felt a sense
of panic.

3179
03:30:58,979 --> 03:31:02,479
Something told her she wouldn't be able to
do it.

3180
03:31:02,479 --> 03:31:05,529
The longer she waited, the worse it would
be.

3181
03:31:05,529 --> 03:31:11,779
The thought of what Doug had done would stick
in her mind like a seed and grow there, filling

3182
03:31:11,779 --> 03:31:13,319
her head with fear.

3183
03:31:13,319 --> 03:31:18,359
Afraid her hand would begin to tremble, she
quickly put down her cup of coffee.

3184
03:31:18,359 --> 03:31:22,119
And then it came to her.

3185
03:31:22,119 --> 03:31:27,589
If she were ever going to fly again, it had
to be as soon as possible.

3186
03:31:27,589 --> 03:31:30,350
She sat up and turned to George.

3187
03:31:30,350 --> 03:31:36,640
'George,' she began, 'would you consider allowing
me to take the other Cessna for a flight?'

3188
03:31:36,640 --> 03:31:39,680
'Of course,' George replied.

3189
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:40,930
'When?'

3190
03:31:40,930 --> 03:31:43,560
'Now,' Francesca answered.

3191
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:44,939
'What!'

3192
03:31:44,939 --> 03:31:46,430
George exclaimed.

3193
03:31:46,430 --> 03:31:47,430
'Now.

3194
03:31:47,430 --> 03:31:50,390
This minute,' Francesca said firmly.

3195
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:57,119
'I know that if I don't go today, I'll never
get in the pilot's seat again; I'll completely

3196
03:31:57,119 --> 03:31:59,909
lose my nerve.'

3197
03:31:59,909 --> 03:32:01,800
George shook his head immediately.

3198
03:32:01,800 --> 03:32:06,149
'No, Francesca, I'm sorry, but it's quite
out of the question.

3199
03:32:06,149 --> 03:32:12,959
You've just had a terrible experience; you're
not thinking straight, you're far too emotional.

3200
03:32:12,959 --> 03:32:15,699
Look at you, you're shaking.'

3201
03:32:15,699 --> 03:32:18,640
Francesca looked at George desperately.

3202
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:21,720
'Just one short flight,' she said.

3203
03:32:21,720 --> 03:32:25,779
'Take off and land, like my first solo.

3204
03:32:25,779 --> 03:32:28,339
If I don't, I'll never fly again.'

3205
03:32:28,339 --> 03:32:32,979
'Well, I'll come with you,' George said.

3206
03:32:32,979 --> 03:32:38,039
'No, it has to be solo,' Francesca insisted.

3207
03:32:38,039 --> 03:32:41,640
George closed his eyes, then opened them.

3208
03:32:41,640 --> 03:32:44,100
He looked across at Tom.

3209
03:32:44,100 --> 03:32:46,170
'You tell her, Tom.

3210
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:47,750
You're her boyfriend.

3211
03:32:47,750 --> 03:32:51,339
Perhaps you can make her see some sense.'

3212
03:32:51,339 --> 03:32:53,560
Francesca turned to Tom.

3213
03:32:53,560 --> 03:32:57,159
He was looking down, his head in his hands.

3214
03:32:57,159 --> 03:33:00,180
Now, he looked up.

3215
03:33:00,180 --> 03:33:02,129
Francesca watched him.

3216
03:33:02,129 --> 03:33:08,119
For a moment, he reminded her of Andrea with
his head held high like that.

3217
03:33:08,119 --> 03:33:12,839
'I think you should let her go, George,' he
said quietly.

3218
03:33:12,839 --> 03:33:18,029
'I think you should let her decide.'

3219
03:33:18,029 --> 03:33:20,670
George stared at Tom in shock.

3220
03:33:20,670 --> 03:33:27,759
Then, after thinking for a while longer, he
finally gave a tiny nod of his head.

3221
03:33:27,759 --> 03:33:28,759
***

3222
03:33:28,759 --> 03:33:35,270
Less than half an hour later, Francesca was
approaching the runway for the second time

3223
03:33:35,270 --> 03:33:42,729
that day, in the other Flying Start Cessna,
G-ABJN.

3224
03:33:42,729 --> 03:33:45,310
She felt perfectly calm.

3225
03:33:45,310 --> 03:33:50,789
She stopped the plane before the runway, turned
into the wind, and did the power checks.

3226
03:33:50,789 --> 03:33:53,119
Then she called the control tower.

3227
03:33:53,119 --> 03:33:54,819
'Norwich Tower.

3228
03:33:54,819 --> 03:34:00,899
Golf Juliet November is ready to line up runway
zero nine.'

3229
03:34:00,899 --> 03:34:04,949
'Golf Juliet November, please wait.'

3230
03:34:04,949 --> 03:34:08,850
Francesca did as instructed, guessing that
another aircraft must be coming in.

3231
03:34:08,850 --> 03:34:15,659
As she waited, she thought about Tom, about
what he'd just done.

3232
03:34:15,659 --> 03:34:21,600
George must have been quite certain that Tom
would say this flight was a crazy idea.

3233
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:23,540
But he hadn't.

3234
03:34:23,540 --> 03:34:26,060
He'd taken Francesca's side.

3235
03:34:26,060 --> 03:34:31,129
He'd put his confidence in her and given her
her freedom.

3236
03:34:31,129 --> 03:34:34,880
That was the kind of love she wanted.

3237
03:34:34,880 --> 03:34:38,420
He was the sort of person she could love.

3238
03:34:38,420 --> 03:34:43,379
A small two-engined plane flew past in front
of her.

3239
03:34:43,379 --> 03:34:49,069
She watched it land, first one of the main
wheels, then the other, finally, the nose

3240
03:34:49,069 --> 03:34:53,039
wheel - a good crosswind landing.

3241
03:34:53,039 --> 03:34:55,839
Then came her call on the radio.

3242
03:34:55,839 --> 03:35:01,270
'Golf Juliet November, line up runway zero
nine.'

3243
03:35:01,270 --> 03:35:06,689
Francesca released the brakes and moved the
plane forward, then swung round onto the piano

3244
03:35:06,689 --> 03:35:08,680
keys and stopped.

3245
03:35:08,680 --> 03:35:12,569
Only then did nerves grip her stomach.

3246
03:35:12,569 --> 03:35:15,319
Did she really want to do this?

3247
03:35:15,319 --> 03:35:18,729
Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea after all.

3248
03:35:18,729 --> 03:35:24,129
In the distance the other plane had disappeared
from the runway.

3249
03:35:24,129 --> 03:35:25,819
She waited.

3250
03:35:25,819 --> 03:35:27,319
Then came the call.

3251
03:35:27,319 --> 03:35:29,720
'Golf Juliet November.

3252
03:35:29,720 --> 03:35:33,619
You are cleared for take-off.'

3253
03:35:33,619 --> 03:35:38,640
Sitting there alone in the plane, she was
suddenly overcome with fear as the memory

3254
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:41,819
of the forced landing came back to her.

3255
03:35:41,819 --> 03:35:43,989
She had nearly died!

3256
03:35:43,989 --> 03:35:47,439
What was she thinking of, going up there again?

3257
03:35:47,439 --> 03:35:50,949
Down here on the ground she was safe.

3258
03:35:50,949 --> 03:35:53,629
The seconds passed.

3259
03:35:53,629 --> 03:35:55,589
She had to do something.

3260
03:35:55,589 --> 03:36:00,260
She could head back to the hangar or go ahead
and take off.

3261
03:36:00,260 --> 03:36:05,359
She stared through the windscreen down the
runway, the white dotted line stretching away

3262
03:36:05,359 --> 03:36:06,760
into the unknown.

3263
03:36:06,760 --> 03:36:12,819
'Like the rest of my life,' she thought to
herself all of a sudden.

3264
03:36:12,819 --> 03:36:15,939
Where would she be in one year's time?

3265
03:36:15,939 --> 03:36:22,959
Would she have passed her private pilot's
exams and be studying for her commercial licence?

3266
03:36:22,959 --> 03:36:25,390
Would she still be living in England?

3267
03:36:25,390 --> 03:36:26,939
Would she still be with Tom?

3268
03:36:26,939 --> 03:36:31,270
And what about in five years' time?

3269
03:36:31,270 --> 03:36:34,129
She had her whole life ahead of her.

3270
03:36:34,129 --> 03:36:40,039
The mystery of the future suddenly filled
her with excitement.

3271
03:36:40,039 --> 03:36:44,439
Without delaying a second longer, she steadily
pushed in the throttle.

3272
03:36:44,439 --> 03:36:50,079
The little plane began running forward immediately,
quickly picking up speed.

3273
03:36:50,079 --> 03:36:51,850
This was it.

3274
03:36:51,850 --> 03:36:58,999
She pulled back on the control column and
felt the plane slowly lift into flight.
