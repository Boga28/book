00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,361
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

3
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:23,961
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

4
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:35,961
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on
forty black horses.

5
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:40,561
They stopped near a huge rock.

6
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:49,001
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

7
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:59,962
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

8
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:14,042
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali
Baba looked and looked again...

9
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:21,282
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

10
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:27,643
Behind the rock was a cave.

11
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:32,683
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

12
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:43,683
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have
their sacks.

13
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:54,003
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

14
00:01:54,003 --> 00:02:02,084
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

15
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:05,924
Ali Baba went to the rock.

16
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:12,604
"Open Sesame," he said.

17
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:24,524
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds
of sacks and wooden boxes.

18
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:33,165
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

19
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:44,085
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

20
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:50,285
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

21
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:58,765
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful
jewels!

22
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:03,925
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

23
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:14,166
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

24
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:22,646
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the
cave.

25
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:27,246
"Close Sesame," he said.

26
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:31,846
The rock closed and he went home.

27
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:37,406
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

28
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:47,647
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure
in the cave.

29
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:56,927
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

30
00:03:56,927 --> 00:04:05,847
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new
clothes?"

31
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:14,768
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

32
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:20,928
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

33
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:28,648
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

34
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:32,288
He opened the door.

35
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:41,288
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

36
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:50,369
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it
myself!"

37
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:57,449
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

38
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:18,490
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes
when you say "Close Sesame".

39
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:32,610
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went
into the cave and the rock closed.

40
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:44,530
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver...
beautiful jewels!"

41
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:55,131
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold
and silver and jewels.

42
00:05:55,131 --> 00:06:06,491
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the
rock didn't open!

43
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:13,651
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

44
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:20,451
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

45
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,931
Cassim was angry.

46
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:27,972
He couldn't remember the word!

47
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:35,092
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

48
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:39,972
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

49
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:40,732
Look!

50
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:41,692
A horse!

51
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:46,292
Someone's in our cave!

52
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:57,252
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall
man.

53
00:06:57,252 --> 00:07:06,413
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

54
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:18,573
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he
is?" she asked.

55
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:23,253
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

56
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:38,934
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men.
They'll kill him!" she said.

57
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,454
Ali went to the rock.

58
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:47,654
It was closed but he heard a noise.

59
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:53,814
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

60
00:07:53,814 --> 00:08:01,854
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

61
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:11,575
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

62
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:19,575
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

63
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:28,175
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

64
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:43,736
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the
doctor can come to the house later tonight."

65
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:51,456
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

66
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:58,016
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

67
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:10,136
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who
helped him!"

68
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:15,937
The tall man found the doctor's house.

69
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:17,697
He was angry.

70
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:28,897
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?"
he asked.

71
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:33,337
"I don't know," said the doctor.

72
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:40,537
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

73
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:51,098
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the
tall man.

74
00:09:51,098 --> 00:10:05,098
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that
night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

75
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:14,218
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

76
00:10:14,218 --> 00:10:21,419
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

77
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:30,739
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big
oil pots.

78
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:40,579
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told
the thieves.

79
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:57,260
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots.
We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

80
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,580
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

81
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:20,580
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a
place for my horses?"

82
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:28,301
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

83
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:32,301
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

84
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:41,061
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

85
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:51,941
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his
horses."

86
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:59,061
They went out of the house into the garden.

87
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:06,302
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very
quiet.

88
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:18,102
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to
kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

89
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

90
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

91
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the
pots, and one man in the house...

92
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The Forty Thieves!

93
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

94
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Open the gate."

95
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
Nasreen opened the gate.

96
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at
the horses.

97
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The horses ran out of the garden.

98
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
They ran and they ran and they ran.

99
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
They ran into the desert and never came back.

100
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was
sleeping.

101
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
His horses weren't there!

102
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
His pots weren't there!

103
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
His men weren't there!

104
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he
couldn't see his horses or his men.

105
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

106
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went
into the garden.

107
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"This is very strange," said Ali.

108
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

109
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
Where are they?"

110
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

111
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

112
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from
India."

113
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"No," said Nasreen.

114
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

115
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

116
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come
back!" said Zhila.

117
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give
some to everyone in the village!"

118
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with
ten grey donkeys.

119
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

120
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's
Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

121
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

122
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks
of treasure on the donkeys.

123
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to
the poor villagers.

124
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,102
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

125
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:18,142
"You're very clever women!"
