1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
BRAINS

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:12,360
The small monkey carefully completed the last piece of the
one-hundred-piece puzzle.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:27,281
When all the pieces of the puzzle were put together, they made a copy of Sunflowers, a picture by the famous painter,
Van Gogh.

4
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:35,041
"Well done, Max!" said a young woman in a white coat.

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:51,041
"It only took you twenty minutes this time - that's much better than the last time you tried it. Have a bite of
lovely banana."

6
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:59,761
The woman reached for the fruit from a bowl close by and
gave it to the monkey.

7
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,401
Max ate it happily.

8
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:12,082
The woman's name was Gina Capaldi and she was twenty-six
years old.

9
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:21,042
She was studying for a Ph.D. at a university in Rome.

10
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:26,682
She was hoping to become a Doctor of Science.

11
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:31,802
Her ideas had already caused much excitement.

12
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:36,202
Now her work was almost finished.

13
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:40,162
Great things were expected of her.

14
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:52,762
As Gina prepared the monkey's next drug, Max played with his
Rubik cube.

15
00:01:52,762 --> 00:02:00,723
The Rubik cube was one of Max's favourite puzzles.

16
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:14,123
He enjoyed turning around the sides of the cube in his hands
so that each of the six sides was a different colour.

17
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:21,083
Gina looked over at him and was pleased.

18
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:25,443
He was getting better every day.

19
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:32,883
Max completed the Rubik cube in five minutes.

20
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:40,804
Mr Dimitri sat behind a big desk in a large office in a huge
building in New York.

21
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:51,084
On the front of his desk was a sign in gold letters which
read: Mr Theodore Dimitri.

22
00:02:51,084 --> 00:03:06,404
On his door there was a much bigger sign which read: President of the Centre for Science and Business Development
(CSBD).

23
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:14,724
Mr Dimitri was middle-aged and wore a large dark-grey suit.

24
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:19,404
He smoked a thick expensive cigar.

25
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:24,244
The smoke from his cigar filled the room.

26
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:30,365
Today he was going to see his most promising new scientists.

27
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:39,365
They were all studying for Ph.D.s so that they could become
Doctors of Science.

28
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:48,245
They had to give him their new ideas if they wanted money
from the CSBD.

29
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:53,365
Mr Dimitri did this every year.

30
00:03:53,365 --> 00:04:01,965
If he liked their work, CSBD would give them lots of money
to develop it.

31
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:06,725
That was the way to make money in the future.

32
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:12,406
And Mr Dimitri was good at making money.

33
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:25,086
But if he didn't like the work of these scientists, or if he
didn't like them, he didn't have to give them a cent.

34
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:33,446
"After all," Mr Dimitri thought, "Business is business."

35
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:39,326
Miss Epstein, his secretary, came into his office.

36
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:47,726
"Miss Capaldi to see you, Mr Dimitri, sir," she said.

37
00:04:47,726 --> 00:05:00,647
"Send her in, Miss Epstein," said Mr Dimitri in a voice
which was cold and business-like.

38
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:08,967
Gina Capaldi stood in her best suit and shoes in front of
the big desk.

39
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:15,447
She wanted to look her best before Mr Dimitri.

40
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:21,807
In her bag was all the information needed about her work.

41
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,047
She felt ready.

42
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:41,848
"Do sit down, Miss Capaldi. I've heard so many good things about you," said Mr Dimitri in a voice that now sounded
friendly and welcoming.

43
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:48,488
"Thank you, Mr Dimitri," said Gina.

44
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:53,008
She sat down in front of the big desk.

45
00:05:53,008 --> 00:06:02,248
Then Miss Epstein seemed to appear out of nowhere with
coffee and biscuits.

46
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:07,048
She put them on the desk and was gone again.

47
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:19,968
"Allow me," said Mr Dimitri, as he put his cigar down for a
moment and poured the coffee.

48
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:25,848
Gina took her coffee and left the biscuits.

49
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:29,049
She didn't feel like eating.

50
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,569
She was nervous.

51
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:40,849
Mr Dimitri smiled at her with teeth that were large and
white.

52
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,929
Perfect teeth.

53
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:48,729
His cigar found its way back to his mouth.

54
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,689
The smoke rose up.

55
00:06:51,689 --> 00:07:00,329
"Tell me, Gina... may I call you Gina?" he asked.

56
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:06,969
"Of course, Mr Dimitri," she answered.

57
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,889
Mr Dimitri continued.

58
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:30,930
"Tell me about your latest work; I've heard very interesting things about it, but I would like you to explain it clearly
to a simple man such as myself."

59
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:38,130
Gina knew that Theodore Dimitri was far from being simple.

60
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:51,930
You don't get to be the head of CSBD, the biggest
organisation of its kind, if you aren't very clever.

61
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,970
She knew his decision could change her life.

62
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:06,771
Gina began: "I've discovered a drug which raises
intelligence."

63
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:13,611
"Hold on, Gina!" said Mr pimitri.

64
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:21,731
"You mean to say you've found a way of making people
smarter?"

65
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:26,411
"Yes," Gina answered.

66
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:34,091
"And without any harmful side effects as far as I can tell .

67
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:40,171
"As far as you can tell?"

68
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:45,052
Mr Dimitri said, his eyebrows raised.

69
00:08:45,052 --> 00:09:00,292
"I mean," said Gina, "the work has not been used on people -
I've only worked on animals. Especially Max."

70
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:05,372
"Max?" asked Mr Dimitri.

71
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:11,292
"Sorry - Max is a monkey," Gina explained.

72
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:20,732
"A monkey..." said Mr Dimitri but his voice sounded less
friendly than it had before.

73
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:28,733
Gina knew she had to persuade him somehow.

74
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:48,293
"Max has done really well - it's quite amazing. He now has the intelligence of an eight-year-old human child. He can do
many things..."

75
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:55,453
"You want money for a performing monkey?" said Mr Dimitri.

76
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:59,133
He sounded a little annoyed.

77
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:14,454
"I can go to any cheap show to see smart monkeys doing
tricks. And I don't have to pay a lot of money for it,
either."

78
00:10:14,454 --> 00:10:31,174
"Mr Dimitri," Gina said as she reached for her bag, "I have a video of Max. I think you should see it before you make
any decisions."

79
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:39,254
"Oh, you do?" His voice was lower - not a good sign.

80
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:43,254
"Yes," said Gina.

81
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:58,454
"If you would allow me. I'm sure you'll be as excited as I am once you've seen it." Gina did not want to give up
without a fight.

82
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:06,735
Her future depended on Mr Dimitri's decision.

83
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:11,975
"Let's see what you've got," he said in his low voice.

84
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:26,815
The video showed Max three years earlier, before Gina had
begun to work on him when he was still a normal monkey.

85
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:38,935
Then, three months after her work had begun, Max was seen
drawing simple pictures with a pencil.

86
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:44,055
After a year he was spelling out simple words.

87
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:50,896
After two years he could add and take away simple numbers.

88
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:58,696
After three years he could read, write and do basic
mathematics.

89
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:04,776
He also understood everything Gina said to him.

90
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:13,136
Max had come to see Gina as his mother and he loved her.

91
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:23,816
The video finished with Max putting his arms around Gina
while Gin" laughed.

92
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:27,296
"That's one smart monkey.

93
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:32,257
Can you make him any smarter?"

94
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,657
Mr Dimitri asked.

95
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:39,457
Gina knew he was interested.

96
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:42,977
She was pleased.

97
00:12:42,977 --> 00:13:00,497
"Max can be as intelligent as we want to make him, Mf Dimitri," she said, trying not to show her pleasure in whac
she had achieved.

98
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,697
"Yes," he said.

99
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:12,217
"But could that monkey be made to be as smart as a man?"(Or
a woman, thought Gina)

100
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:23,858
"As I said, Mr Dimitri," said Gina, "we can make him as
intelligent as we want to."

101
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:35,578
"You mean," asked Mr Dimitri, "that that monkey could get to
be smarter than I am?"

102
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:56,218
"I suppose it is possible - there's no reason why not, as far as I can tell. Although, of course, Max is a long way
from that just now," Gina said.

103
00:13:56,218 --> 00:14:04,059
"But you're working on it, right?" Mr Dimitri asked.

104
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:10,619
"Well, er... yes." Gina was less confident now.

105
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:26,099
"And what if you worked on a human being - could you make
them smarter?" he asked.

106
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:34,459
Gina answered: "I think so, Mr Dimitri."

107
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:39,339
Mr Dimitri narrowed his eyes.

108
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,339
"You only think so?"

109
00:14:43,339 --> 00:15:00,060
"Well," said Gina, "the brains of a monkey and a man are
built in much the same way, so I'm almost certain."

110
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:15,740
"Almost certain. Hmm..." Mr Dimitri looked out of the
window, down at the streets of the busy city far below them.

111
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,340
His cigar smoke rose lazily to the ceiling.

112
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:38,941
Gina's hopes of money and success - and her Ph.D. - depended
largely on the decision Mr Dimitri would make.

113
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:45,621
"Tell me, Miss Capaldi..." said Mr Dimitri.

114
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:53,621
Gina noticed he had stopped using her first name.

115
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,581
This looked bad.

116
00:15:55,581 --> 00:16:15,261
"... have you ever taken this stuff yourself to increase your own intelligence?" Widi that, he turned to look out of
the window again.

117
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:22,262
"Of course not, Mr Dimitri," Gina said to the back of his
head.

118
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:27,342
"But if you think I should..."

119
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:38,702
"NO!" Mr Dimitri had turned suddenly from the window as he
said this.

120
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:48,182
The speed of his action surprised her because he was such a
large man.

121
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:54,022
His eyes were wide and looked angry.

122
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,262
Gina was scared.

123
00:16:56,262 --> 00:17:21,063
"Miss Capaldi," Mr Dimitri said, lowering his voice, "your work has been very good. In fact, it has been excellent and
you have my congratulations.

124
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:31,503
Unfortunately, I must ask you to stop what you are doing. At
"once."

125
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:41,543
Gina's mouth suddenly felt very dry and she felt the hairs
on her head rise up.

126
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:55,184
"But Mr Dimitri," she said, "I've done so much... all my
work, my Ph.D!"

127
00:17:55,184 --> 00:18:11,904
"Who is going to believe you if they wonder for one moment if you took some of this stuff yourself?" Mr Dimitri's voice
softened.

128
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:24,864
"They would say that anybody could get a Ph.D. with your
wonder drug to help them. And they'd be right."

129
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:39,545
"But I never... I mean... I wouldn't dream of doing such a
thing!" said Gina.

130
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:45,905
She tried not to show the disappointment she felt.

131
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:52,665
"Wouldn't you?" said Mr Dimitri.

132
00:18:52,665 --> 00:19:05,665
"There are many people that would take this stuff. And many
that would think that you had, too."

133
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:10,225
Gina looked alarmed, but said nothing.

134
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:29,786
"Yes," he continued, "it's a sad fact but a true one. Many people would think that you had taken your own drug to make
yourself smarter.

135
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:40,746
They would see you as being no different to those athletes
who take stuff they're not supposed to take.

136
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:51,306
It might make them do better but it's not honest, is it, Miss Capaldi? And it's no different for CSBD - we do not
want people to think that we are anything other than a completely honest organisation.

137
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
If they ever thought we had anything to do with such
behaviour they would never trust us again!"

138
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"But I promise you... my work has all been done honestly,"
said Gina.

139
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"I never took anything!"

140
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"But," said Mr Dimitri as he looked straight at Gina's eyes,
"you would if I asked you to, wouldn't you?"

141
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina knew it was true, so she said nothing and looked at the
floor.

142
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Mr Dimitri turned his great weight towards her and put his
hand on her shoulder.

143
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"I understand how much you want to succeed, Miss Capaldi.
Don't worry...

144
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
I'm going to talk to the people at your university - I think
you should have a Ph.D. for the work you've done so far..."

145
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina raised her eyes.

146
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"Yes, Miss Capaldi, I believe in your honesty and believe you are a brilliant young scientist. I would very much like
you to continue to work for us..."

147
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina shut her eyes.

148
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
She was tod happy to speak.

149
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"... but in a different area," Mr Dimitri added.

150
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina opened her eyes.

151
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
She could hardly believe what she had heard.

152
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"But what about my work?" she asked.

153
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"You may carry on if you wish," said Mr Dimitri, "but you
will have no money from us if you do.

154
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And I think I can say that nobody else will help you if I
have anything to say about it - and I will."

155
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina felt bad about losing her work.

156
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
But she had been offered a job - and her Ph.D.

157
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"If you leave all your work with us, Miss Capaldi, we'll
make sure that it is properly taken care of.

158
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
After all, you have made a discovery which could change the
world someday.

159
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And you can be sure that we will recognise you as the person
behind it all when the time comes.

160
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
But it could take a long time.

161
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"But right now we would like to use your clever brain to the
full in doing important work for us.

162
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And, of course, you will be safe in the knowledge that you
have the CSBD behind you.

163
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
You will never be short of money again.

164
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
So why not join us, Gina?

165
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
What do you say?"

166
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina felt surprisingly good about the offer.

167
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And I'll get recognition for my work?"

168
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Gina asked.

169
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"Definitely" said Mr Dimitri.

170
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"Mr Dimitri, I accept!"

171
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
There were smiles and goodbyes and, soon after, a happy Gina
Capaldi left the room.

172
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Mr Dimitri sat down, lit another cigar and watched the smoke
rise up to the ceiling before it finally disappeared.

173
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
He knew that business was not good when people asked too
many questions.

174
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
If people were made to be too smart they would do just that.

175
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And once they didn't get the answers they wanted, they might
not buy things.

176
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
And if they didn't buy things there would be no money to be
made.

177
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
No-one would like that.

178
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
No-one at all.

179
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Miss Capaldi's work would be put away somewhere nice and
safe.

180
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Somewhere secret.

181
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Along with all the other dangerous ideas.

182
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Like the car that ran on water, or the shoes that never wore
out, or the battery that never stopped.

183
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
But he was glad to have Miss Capaldi.

184
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
She was bright.

185
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
He ought to give her something to do.

186
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
Something that would make a lot of money.

187
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
He picked up his telephone.

188
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"Miss Epstein... See that Miss Capaldi is sent to the
biological science centre.

189
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
I want her to be a part of that three-legged chicken plan.

190
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
She can do it, if anybody can. She's one smart lady. Oh, and
Miss Epstein..."

191
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,306
"Yes, Mr Dimitri?" said Miss Epstein.

192
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:51,346
"I want you to see that a dangerous animal from one of our
centres is killed. It's a monkey. His name is Max."
