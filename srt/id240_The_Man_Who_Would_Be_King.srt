CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
The Plan

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,670
India was a wild, strange, and dangerous place
when I worked there as a journalist many years

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,770
ago.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,349
It was even wilder, stranger, and more dangerous
than it is today.

6
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,740
It was the kind of place where you never knew
what was going to happen next.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,630
It was a place where people lived by laws
that nobody could understand, and where you

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,899
could be suddenly rich or suddenly poor and
then suddenly rich again. 

9
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:44,329
You could be a beggar one day, a prince the
next, and then a beggar again.

10
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,280
All sorts of strange people came from England
to try and make money there, and they found

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,320
very unusual ways to make it.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,870
There was enormous wealth in India, and if
you could find a way to get some of it you

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,579
could live very well.

14
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:04,339
If you couldn't find a way, you would live
very badly indeed; begging is not fun.

15
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:11,190
At the time that my story begins, I wasn't
a beggar, but I was certainly not a prince.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,909
I was traveling to Mhow from Ajmir on the
train, and because of lack of funds, I had

17
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,200
to travel in third class, which is not very
nice.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,659
There are no cushions on the seats, and the
passengers carry their food in bundles and

19
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,130
pots and drink water from the roadside.

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,399
In summer, when it is really hot, third-class
passengers are sometimes carried out of the

21
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,040
carriages dead.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,500
I was the only person in the carriage until
we reached Nasirabad, when a huge Englishman

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,149
in shirt sleeves came in and began to talk
to me.

24
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,740
He was also a traveler, and we shared stories
of our past adventures.

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,020
He then wondered how he could send a telegram
to his friend, who was in Ajmir, because he

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,729
only had enough money for his dinner.

27
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:03,280
I had no money at all, and although I would
be paid when I reached Mhow there was no telegraph

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,020
office there, so I was not able to help him.

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,650
"Did you say that you would be traveling back
along this line soon?" asked my big friend.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,830
"In about ten days," I replied.

31
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,780
"Can't you make it eight?

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,950
My business is urgent."

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,950
"I can send your telegram for you in ten days'
time if that will help you," I said.

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,860
My fellow-passenger thought about it for a
moment.

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,400
"My friend is traveling from Delhi to Bombay
on the twenty-third, so I don't think the

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,090
telegram will reach him in time, but perhaps
there is another way.

37
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,730
He will pass through Marwar Junction early
in the morning of the twenty-fourth, and you

38
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,080
might be returning through there at about
that time.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,920
Do you think you could be there to give him
a message?

40
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,300
If I don't tell him where I am, he won't know
where to go."

41
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,500
I thought that this might just be possible.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,320
"All you have to say to him is, 'He has gone
south for the week.'

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,019
He'll know what that means.

44
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,480
He's a big man with a red beard, and he'll
be asleep in a second-class carriage.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,160
Just wake him up and tell him the message."

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,710
I said that I would do it if I could, and
then he told me that he was on his way to

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,430
Degumber because he had heard that the Raja
had done something bad.

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,660
His plan was to blackmail the Raja by pretending
to be a journalist and threatening to publish

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,390
the story in his newspaper.

50
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,530
People like him generally lived a hard life
and died suddenly.

51
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,340
I kept my promise and was at Marwar Junction
on the twenty-fourth.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,030
I found the red-bearded man in a second-class
carriage, woke him up, and told him the message.

53
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,349
"I am to tell you that he has gone south for
the week."

54
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:43,879
The red-bearded man rubbed his eyes.

55
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,390
"That's just like him.

56
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,390
Did he say I was to give you anything?

57
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,390
I won't."

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,680
I told him that he did not have to give me
anything, and I watched the train pull away

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,180
from the station.

60
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,230
I didn't want the two men to get into trouble
in Degumber, so I described them to the authorities.

61
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,989
This prevented them from entering Degumber
at all.

62
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,239
I got a job at the newspaper office, where
we reported all the important events from

63
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,319
Europe as well as India.

64
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:18,690
Kings died, wars began and ended, politicians
made speeches, and ladies had afternoon teas.

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,080
During the hot summer, the only things that
happen in India happen in the hill towns,

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,419
where it is cooler, and nobody comes into
the office where I work.

67
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,330
One hot summer Saturday night, I was in the
office alone, waiting for a telegram about

68
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,780
a sick king so that the paper could be up-to-date
with the news before it was printed.

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,350
It was a very black night with a westerly
wind blowing in hot air from the desert.

70
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,330
I was surprised to see two men wearing white
clothes come into the office, and when they

71
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,650
saw me, they laughed.

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,210
One was the man I had met on the train, and
the other was the red-bearded man to whom

73
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,040
I had given a message.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,639
I asked them what they wanted.

75
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,470
"We'd like to talk to you for half an hour,"
said the red-bearded man, "and ask you for

76
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,780
some advice.

77
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,990
We think you owe it to us because you stopped
us from going to Degumber."

78
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,259
I invited them to sit down, and they introduced
themselves.

79
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,590
"This is Peachey Carnehan," said the red-bearded
man, pointing to the other, "and I am Daniel

80
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,810
Dravot, and we have been most things in our
lives, including soldiers, sailors, proof-readers,

81
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,340
photographers, street preachers, journalists,
engine drivers, and so on, but we think India

82
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,699
is not big enough for us."

83
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,340
They were certainly too big for the office.

84
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,710
Dravot's red beard filled half of it, and
Carnehan's shoulders filled the other half.

85
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,720
"We don't like all the laws that the government
makes," said Carnehan, "so we are going away

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,400
to be kings, and we have signed a contract
that we will not drink alcohol or go near

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
any women until we are kings.

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,860
It is alcohol and women that give us most
trouble and stop us from getting ahead."

89
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,169
I thought they had been out in the heat and
were affected by the sun, but they were serious,

90
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,590
and Carnehan continued to tell me their plan.

91
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:14,650
"There's a place to the north of India called
Kafiristan, where no Englishman has ever been

92
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,729
and where the people are always fighting each
other.

93
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:22,680
We will teach one of the tribes to have a
proper army and then overthrow the king and

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,259
take his place and establish a dynasty."

95
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,539
"You'll never get there," I said.

96
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,950
"No Englishman has ever crossed Afghanistan
because of its wild mountains and even wilder

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,050
people."

98
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,759
Despite my warning, they wanted to look at
maps, so I gave them some, as well as an encyclopedia

99
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,950
and some other books so that they could read
about Kafiristan.

100
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,070
I sat and smoked and watched them for a while
and then went home, leaving them with the

101
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,070
books.

102
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,930
"Come to the market tomorrow," they said as
I left, "and we will say goodbye to you then."

103
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,930
"You will never get past the border," I repeated.

104
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,660
"Stay here, and I will try to find you some
work."

105
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,770
"No, we are going," said Carnehan, and he
showed me the contract they had made as proof

106
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,250
that they were serious.

107
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,590
CHAPTER TWO

108
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,440
To Kafiristan and Back

109
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,930
I went to the market the next day.

110
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,930
It was a place where all the nationalities
of Central Asia come, as well as people from

111
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,919
all over India, and where you could buy ponies,
precious stones, cats, sheep, and hundreds

112
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,120
of other things, many of which don't even
have names in English.

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,380
A priest approached me, carrying a child's
toy, and his servant walked behind him, carrying

114
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,870
a heavy basket full of children's toys.

115
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,550
Everybody laughed at them, and a horse trader
told me they were mad.

116
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,660
"He is going to Kabul to sell the toys to
the Amir, but I think that he will have his

117
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,660
head cut off."

118
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,150
"God protects the mad," said an Uzbek, "and
they always bring good luck."

119
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,000
The Uzbek shouted to the mad priest, "Where
do you come from?"

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,770
"I come from Roum, blown by the breath of
a hundred devils across the sea!

121
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,550
Listen all you liars and thieves.

122
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,370
Who will take me north to help me sell these
magic toys to the Amir?

123
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,010
God will protect you if you protect me."

124
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,750
A trader from Eusufzai told him there was
a caravan leaving from Peshawar in twenty

125
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,990
days and that he was welcome to join it.

126
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,560
The priest and his servant leapt onto their
camels.

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,880
As they left, the priest turned to me and
invited me to come a little way along the

128
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,380
road with him, promising to give me a ring
that would make me the King of Kafiristan.

129
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,979
Suddenly, I understood, and I followed the
priest and his servant out of the market.

130
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,250
When we reached the open road, the priest
spoke to me in English.

131
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,990
It was Dravot.

132
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,630
Carnehan was his servant, and they had twenty
of the best rifles that money could buy, with

133
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,490
ammunition for them, hidden under their basket
of toys.

134
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,130
They both shook hands with me and said goodbye,
and I watched the camels go down the road.

135
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:09,329
I was certain that I would never see them
again because their plan was insane and full

136
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,910
of danger.

137
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,649
Two years passed.

138
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,380
Lots of things happened in those two years,
and all of the important ones were recorded

139
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,310
in our newspaper.

140
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,490
Kings died, but the daily work in our office
remained the same.

141
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,610
On another one of those hot dark nights, I
was again sitting alone in the office, waiting

142
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,089
for some news to come by telegram when a strange
creature crept into my room.

143
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:39,090
It was a man, but his head was sunk between
his shoulders, and he shuffled along like

144
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,120
a bear.

145
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,320
He was dressed in rags, but he called out
my name and told me that he had returned.

146
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,240
"Give me a drink!" he croaked.

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,740
"Don't you know me?

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,730
I am Peachey Carnehan, and I was the King
of Kafiristan, together with Daniel Dravot,

149
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,520
and you have been sitting here all that time!"

150
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,060
I was more than astonished and said so.

151
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,670
"We were real kings, with crowns on our heads!

152
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,790
Poor Daniel, he would not take advice, though
I begged him."

153
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,790
I gave him a whiskey and told him to stay
calm and tell me his story slowly.

154
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:20,430
"I'm not mad," he said, "but you need to look
into my eyes, or I will forget."

155
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,930
I saw his hands and they were like bird claws,
with a strange scar on the back of each.

156
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,000
Then I looked into his eyes.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,130
"You left the market on your camels, with
Dravot dressed as a mad priest, and you were

158
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,440
his servant.

159
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Can you remember that?"

160
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
I asked.

161
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,050
"Yes, and we joined a caravan, but we left
it before Jagdallak, because we heard that

162
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,230
the roads to Kafiristan were good from there.

163
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,170
We dressed in all sorts of strange clothes.

164
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,930
Dravot burned off half his beard and shaved
his head into strange patterns.

165
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,560
We went into the mountains, which were tall
and black and they always fought each other."

166
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,320
I looked at him strangely and said to him
slowly, "Here, have another glass of whiskey."

167
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,860
He continued, "After a while, our camels could
go no further.

168
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,139
We killed the camels, but first we unloaded
the guns and ammunition, and when two men

169
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,240
came along with four mules, we killed one
of the men.

170
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,190
The other one ran away, leaving us the four
mules, so we put the rifles on the mules and

171
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,260
went further into the mountains.

172
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,910
Dravot sang as he went along, but I was afraid
and begged him to stop.

173
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,570
Dravot wouldn't stop, saying that if a king
could not sing, it was not worth being a king.

174
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,550
"We marched through the mountains with our
mules and our guns for ten cold days, and

175
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,060
then we came to a wide valley.

176
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,980
The mules were almost dead, so we killed them
and sat on the boxes of guns.

177
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,540
Ten men came running into the valley, carrying
bows and arrows and chasing twenty men with

178
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,090
bows and arrows.

179
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,500
We could see that this was an opportunity
to start the business of becoming kings.

180
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,019
We took out our rifles and began to shoot
at the twenty men and killed most of them.

181
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:17,920
Then the ten men fired an arrow at us, but
Dravot fired a bullet over their heads, and

182
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,980
they all fell down.

183
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,120
Dravot walked over to them and began to kick
them, and then he shook hands with them in

184
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,810
a friendly way.

185
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,640
He made them carry the boxes of guns across
the valley and up a hill to their village,

186
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,889
as if he were already their king.

187
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,860
"In the village, there were some very large
carved rocks, and Dravot stood in front of

188
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,550
the biggest one, opened his mouth, and pointed
down it.

189
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,780
One of the men offered him some food, but
he refused.

190
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,639
Another man offered him food, but he refused
again.

191
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,620
Then the oldest and most important looking
man in the village offered him some food,

192
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,940
and he accepted it.

193
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,940
"That's how we came to our first village,
as if we had tumbled out of the sky, but later

194
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,250
we tumbled from one of those rope bridges,
and you can't laugh much after that."

195
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,820
"Have some more whiskey," I said to him, "and
tell me how you became kings."

196
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,529
CHAPTER THREE

197
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,779
Carnehan Tells How He Became a King

198
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:30,730
"Dravot sat by the large rock every day, and
the people in the village came to worship

199
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,730
him.

200
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,139
Then some other people came into the valley.

201
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,520
Dravot and I shot them before they knew what
was happening.

202
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,490
We ran down into the valley and up the other
side and found another village, and all the

203
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,760
people there were afraid of us.

204
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,070
Dravot made the two villages work together
in the valley digging up the land, and we

205
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,959
began to learn some of their language.

206
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,970
We chose twenty good men and showed them how
to use a rifle and make a military formation.

207
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,350
They were our army.

208
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,399
"Then we went into the next valley and found
another village, which was very poor because

209
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,860
the land was too rocky, so we took the people
from there and gave them some land in the

210
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,450
good valley.

211
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,820
We found another valley, but the army was
afraid to go there, so Dravot shot one of

212
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,410
them, and the others were suddenly more courageous.

213
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,930
We made friends with the people, and Dravot
left me there while he searched for more villages.

214
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,790
"A big chief came across the mountains to
us because he had heard that there was a new

215
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,790
chief in the area.

216
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,959
I shot one of his men as they were approaching
and told the big chief to come forward alone

217
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,759
and shake hands, or they would all die.

218
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,709
The big chief obeyed.

219
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:54,750
I asked him if he had an enemy, and when he
said that he did we trained some of his men,

220
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,160
and together we marched to a plain on top
of a hill where the enemy was, and we shot

221
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,640
some people there and made the others our
friends.

222
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,029
I sent a message to Dravot because I was worried
that our kingdom was becoming too big to look

223
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:13,720
after by myself, but it was two months before
he returned.

224
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,860
When he did, he had an army of hundreds of
men with him and was wearing a golden crown.

225
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,420
"He was very excited because the people all
thought that he was a god, descended from

226
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,579
Alexander the Great and Queen Semiramis, and
they thought I was his younger brother and

227
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,200
also a god.

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,199
He opened a bag and gave me a golden crown
as well.

229
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,089
It was very heavy, but I wore it for a while
because it made me look so grand.

230
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,899
He brought one of the chiefs to me and asked
me to shake hands with him.

231
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,089
Dravot had given him the name of Billy Fish.

232
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:56,670
I shook hands with him and nearly fell over;
he had given me the secret Freemason's handshake!

233
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,520
'"Does he know the secret words, too?'

234
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I asked.

235
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,741
Dravot assured me that he did, that all the
priests and chiefs knew them, and that they

236
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:11,700
had made Freemason marks in the rocks, but
that they did not know the Third Degree.

237
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,589
Dravot could hardly believe it himself, but
he declared that he would make himself Grand

238
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,259
Master, as well as king and a god, because
it would help him to run the country more

239
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,399
easily.

240
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,370
I agreed, and we ordered the women to make
lots of Freemason aprons for the men to wear.

241
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,639
"Then we held a meeting, where we told all
the people that we were gods and descendents

242
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,720
of Alexander, as well as Grand Masters, and
that we had come to make Kafiristan a place

243
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
where everyone could live happily and in peace.

244
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,780
One of the old priests saw the Freemason marks
on our aprons, which made him shout and try

245
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,750
to push over one of the large rocks.

246
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,270
It was very frightening because I thought
he was going to reveal that we were frauds.

247
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,100
But when he and his friends pushed over the
stone and cleaned the bottom of it, we could

248
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,510
see the ancient Freemason mark on the stone.

249
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,429
It was exactly like the one on our aprons.

250
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,970
The old priest fell to the ground and kissed
Dravot's feet.

251
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,550
It was a miracle, or, as Dravot said, luck.

252
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,339
"After that day, we had no trouble convincing
the villages to stop fighting each other and

253
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:30,030
to form an army to protect themselves against
people from places further away.

254
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,510
We worked very hard for the next six months,
teaching the people about farming and helping

255
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,480
them to build rope bridges across the deep
ravines.

256
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,310
We trained the army, which became quite large,
and settled complaints and disputes with the

257
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,370
help of Billy Fish and some other chiefs.

258
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,350
"Then we took some of the gold and valuable
gems that were in the country, and I took

259
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,169
them to the Ghorband country, where we bought
a hundred more rifles and ammunition and gave

260
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,610
them to the army.

261
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,720
I was very busy training the army, and Dravot
did most of the other work of kingship.

262
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
He was becoming so excited that he started
talking about establishing an empire rather

263
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,350
than just a kingdom.

264
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,970
He reckoned that there were about two million
people in his kingdom, and he could have an

265
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,780
army of two hundred and fifty thousand fighting
men, who would help England protect India

266
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,620
if the Russians ever decided to attack.

267
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,549
"He was sure that Queen Victoria would be
grateful.

268
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,090
His plans became grander and grander, and
he decided that he needed more men to help

269
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,270
him run the country, insisting that they had
to be clever and wise and have skills that

270
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,230
I did not possess.

271
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,610
I was angry when he said this because I knew
he thought I was not wise or clever enough

272
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,140
to help him.

273
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,270
However, he told me that I was still a king
and that half the kingdom was mine, and that

274
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:05,190
the men he needed had to be cleverer than
either of us because the kingdom was now so

275
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,190
large.

276
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:13,909
Then he told me something else that he wanted
to do, but this time I could not agree with

277
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,140
him at all."

278
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
CHAPTER FOUR

279
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,159
Kings, Gods, and Men

280
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,870
"'Winter is coming,' said Dravot, 'and nothing
much will happen then because it is too cold,

281
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,870
so I am going to get a wife, and I think you
should, too.'

282
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,840
"'I don't think it is a good idea,' I replied.

283
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,390
'We still have a lot to do.

284
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,480
Remember all the trouble that women have brought
us in the past.

285
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,429
We made a contract!'

286
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,120
"'But the contract was only until we became
kings, and we have been kings for many months

287
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
now.

288
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,470
We should both have nice, young, healthy girls
to keep us warm in winter, and we can take

289
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,000
any one of them that we choose, perhaps even
more than one, because we are kings.'

290
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,750
"'I'm staying away from women until we are
a lot more settled than we are now!

291
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,539
I haven't forgotten the trouble they made
for me when we were living in Mogul Street

292
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,539
in Bengal.'

293
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,909
"'But this will not be a Bengali woman.

294
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,250
This will be a queen.'

295
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,820
"I warned him that it could only lead to trouble.

296
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
'Don't do it, Daniel.'

297
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,030
"'I will do it,' he said, and walked away
from me.

298
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,809
The sun shone on his red beard and on his
crown, and he looked as if he was on fire.

299
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,150
"Getting a wife was not as easy as Dravot
thought.

300
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,560
He asked the chiefs about it, but they did
not give any advice, until Billy Fish said

301
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,360
he had better ask the girls which of them
wanted to be the queen, but this made Dravot

302
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
angry.

303
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,179
He thought that a king should not ask a girl
to be queen but that the chiefs should find

304
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,730
one for him.

305
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,600
He shouted at the chiefs about all the things
he had done for them and walked away.

306
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,070
"I asked Billy Fish what the problem was,
and he told me that no girl would marry a

307
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,000
god or a devil because they thought they would
die if they did.

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,910
I tried to explain this to Dravot, but he
would not listen and ordered the chiefs to

309
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,440
give him a wife the next day.

310
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,260
I was awake very early the next morning, and
when I went out I saw the chiefs and priests

311
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,690
standing around whispering to each other,
and they looked at me out of the corners of

312
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,690
their eyes.

313
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,000
"'What's the matter?'

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,700
I asked Billy Fish.

315
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,120
"'I can't really say, but if the king would
give up this idea of marriage it would be

316
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,900
better for him and also for us.'

317
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,929
"I knew that Dravot would not change his mind.

318
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,409
I told Billy Fish that we were not gods but
only men.

319
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,090
He said that it would be better to let the
people believe that we were gods.

320
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,409
Nevertheless, he told me that he had twenty
men who would be loyal to the two kings no

321
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,220
matter what happened.

322
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,679
"Winter was already beginning, and there was
a little snow on the ground when Dravot arrived

323
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,070
for the wedding.

324
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:09,040
I urged him once more to drop the plan and
warned him that there would be trouble, but

325
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,330
he would not take any notice.

326
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,180
"'There will be no trouble, Peachey,' he said,
'for they are my people, and they love me

327
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,820
more than they love their fathers.

328
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,980
Where's the girl?

329
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,140
Let the emperor see if his wife suits him!'

330
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,240
All the chiefs and priests were there, and
a group of priests brought a girl to Dravot.

331
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,140
"She was beautifully dressed and wore a large
number of jewels.

332
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,429
The priests blew the trumpets loudly enough
to wake the dead.

333
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:45,020
The girl looked back at the priests as she
came toward Dravot, her face as white as death.

334
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,630
"'She'll do,' said Dravot.

335
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,820
'Come and kiss me, girl.

336
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,580
You don't need to be afraid.'

337
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:57,309
He put his arms around her, and she closed
her eyes and put her face into his red beard.

338
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,660
'She's bitten me!'

339
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,340
exclaimed Dravot, putting his hand on his
neck where her teeth had broken the skin.

340
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,000
His hand had blood on it, and the priests
began to howl.

341
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,380
'Not a god, not a devil, but just a man!'

342
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:19,090
"Billy Fish pushed us both to where his loyal
twenty soldiers were, just as the army attacked.

343
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,770
The loyal twenty tried to protect us, but
the army had too many people in it now, and

344
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,140
we had to run.

345
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,890
Dravot blamed me for not keeping the army
under control and called me every bad name

346
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,940
under the sun.

347
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,140
"'We cannot escape,' said Billy Fish, 'because
the priests will be telling everybody in the

348
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,750
valley that you are not gods or devils but
just men.

349
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,260
I am a dead man.'

350
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,810
"He fell to the ground and began to pray.

351
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:53,020
We got away from the village, but only six
of the twenty men were still alive.

352
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,620
It was very steep country, and when we came
to a village, the people there began to shoot

353
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,130
at us because they had already received the
priests' message.

354
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,190
A bullet hit Dravot in the leg, and this woke
him up.

355
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,559
"'It is my fault, Billy Fish.

356
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,080
You get away from here and save yourself!

357
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,830
And you go, too, Carnehan.

358
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,390
They may not kill you.'

359
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,640
"But Billy Fish would not leave us, and I
would not leave Dravot, either.

360
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,740
We told the last six men that they could run,
and they did.

361
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,880
Then Dravot, Billy Fish, and I walked to the
village, where trumpets, drums, and horns

362
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,330
were making a lot of noise.

363
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,530
It was very cold up there, and I have a lump
of that cold in the back of my head right

364
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,530
now."

365
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,909
I realized that Carnehan's story was almost
at an end.

366
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:44,440
"What happened after that?"

367
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,700
I asked him.

368
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,210
"They took the three of us without making
a sound.

369
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,600
I shot a few of them, but they did not care.

370
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,240
The others closed in around us, and I could
smell them.

371
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,330
They cut Billy Fish's throat as if he were
a pig.

372
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,500
Then they took the king and made him walk
to the middle of one of his rope bridges.

373
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,690
They cut the ropes of the bridge, and the
king fell into the ravine, and I saw his body

374
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,659
on the rocks below, with the golden crown
next to it.

375
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,070
"They took me to some trees and nailed me
to the trees with wooden nails through my

376
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,610
hands and feet, but I didn't die.

377
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,779
They took me down the next day and let me
go.

378
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,559
Sir, you knew Daniel Dravot," he cried out.

379
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,990
"Would you like to see him now?"

380
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,940
He reached into his loose clothes and brought
out a bag, from which he pulled a red-bearded

381
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,840
head and a golden crown which he placed gently
on the head.

382
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,090
I shuddered, for it was strange to see the
head of a man you had once spoken to when

383
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,159
he was alive.

384
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,000
"I must go now," Carnehan said quietly.

385
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,150
I gave him a bottle of whiskey and a little
money, put him in my carriage, and drove him

386
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,690
to a hospital.

387
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,460
The next day, he died, and nobody ever saw
the head of the king or his crown again.
