CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,600
On board the Parvina

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
Leaning on the rail at the stern of the 
cruise ship Parvina, sipping his champagne,  

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,280
Eddie Munro looked out across the water and into 
the darkness. There was a warm, gentle breeze,  

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,200
and the sea was calm except for the dizzy trail of 
water churned up by the ship's angry propellers.  

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
It was a beautiful evening and there was no 
one else on deck. Eddie liked it that way.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
He looked down at his watch, 
which showed 10.31 p.m.,  

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
and the ship was already 
half a mile from the harbour.  

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,800
He was amazed that such a huge cruise ship could 
move so fast - he was amazed it stayed afloat at  

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,280
all! He watched St Thomas island getting further 
and further away. He stared at the silhouette of  

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,560
the island, at its faint black shapes of hills 
rising up into the night sky. Eddie smiled to  

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,520
himself as he noticed he could no longer see 
where the lights ended and the stars began.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
He finished his champagne and, for good 
luck, threw the glass far out into the sea.  

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,640
He never heard it drop. He couldn't see much 
at all in the warm Caribbean darkness, but he  

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
noticed for the first time how high up he was. 
The sea was a long, long way down, he thought.

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
At this point his wife, Lynn, came out 
looking for him, wearing her long black  

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,400
evening dress and the silk purple scarf she 
had bought on the excursion earlier in the day.  

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,000
Her hair was dark and short 
with plum-coloured highlights.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
He turned to put his arm 
around her as she joined him.  

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
He noticed her perfume, a 
powerful and luxurious scent.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,040
"Hello," he said, turning round. "You smell 
nice. And you look lovely. Are you married?"

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,000
"Yes, thank you. To a very wealthy man, 
so you have no chance," she said, smiling.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
"Ah. But so am I."

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,320
"Ah, so you're married to a wealthy man, are you?"

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,480
"I mean I'm wealthy. Very rich, in fact."

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
"Well aren't you the lucky one," Lynn said.

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
"Yes, so if you're lucky, I might buy you dinner,"  

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,080
said Eddie, turning back to 
look out to sea once more.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,680
"Well, lucky me. How can I refuse such charm?" 
She looked at him and took hold of his hand.  

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
She smiled and stared out into the night, too, 
to the island which was now even further away.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,720
"I thought I'd find you out here," she said. "How  

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,960
many glasses have you thrown 
into the sea this evening?"

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
"Only two," he said.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,860
"Eddie!"

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
"It's good luck."

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,760
"No, it isn't. Not if you're a 
fish and you get hit by a glass."

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,480
"The fish might like it. It's 
probably quite boring being a fish.  

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
The sudden arrival of a champagne 
glass might brighten up your life."

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
"Or end it," she said.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,600
"It's fun," said Eddie. "You should try it."

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,120
"I think I've had enough 
champagne," his wife said.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,320
"I love the way the glass disappears the minute 
it leaves my hand, and the sea eats it up. You  

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,640
can't see it falling and you can't hear it 
hit the water. But you know it's landed,  

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,480
dived in and sunk to the bottom. Imagine 
- a tiny glass holding a giant ocean."

45
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,240
"You think too much," she said, moving away 
and pulling him with her. "Why don't you come  

46
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,240
back inside? They're serving coffee and 
I think there's going to be some jazz."

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,600
"All right," he said. "Just a few more minutes."

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,600
"We have two more weeks on this cruise, Eddie. 
You have plenty of time to take it all in."

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
"It's incredible, though, isn't 
it? So beautiful. It's perfect."

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Lynn laughed. "It's completely black. 
I can't see anything in the dark."

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,080
"I know. But it's all out there. The blue sea, 
the white sand, the palm trees, the boats..."

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
"The champagne glasses..."

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
"Very funny," said Eddie. Then 
he pointed to the horizon.  

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,040
"Look over there at the dots of light. Do you 
think they're lights on the island or stars?"

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,880
Lynn looked hard into the night and 
gave it some thought. "Erm... lights."

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
"But you're not sure."

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
"I am sure. I'm always sure."

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
"Hmm," he said. "How is that?"

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
"Because I'm always right," she said, smiling.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,040
"Oh really?"

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
"Of course. I was right about setting 
up your own business, wasn't I?"

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,420
"Yes."

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,600
"And I was right about selling the business  

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,840
off this year for twenty million - 
only sixteen years after starting."

65
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
"Possibly," he teased. He 
wouldn't give in so easily.

66
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,400
"And I was right to let you take me on this 
cruise to relax and celebrate in style."

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
"Oh, I see. How generous."

68
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,240
"Just think. You don't have to work ever 
again. You're a millionaire, Mr Edward Munro.  

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,760
How does that sound?"

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
"Lucky me," he said proudly.

71
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,880
"Yes, lucky you. Lucky us. Now 
come inside before we lose all  

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,680
our money paying for missing champagne glasses."

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Back inside, the dining room was full of people. 
It was hot, but the lighting made it welcoming  

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,320
and comfortable. In the time Eddie had been 
outside, a space had been cleared for dancing and  

75
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,800
a few couples were already on their feet. In the 
corner, four musicians, three men and one woman,  

76
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,560
were playing a song Eddie knew well, but he 
couldn't recall its name. The singer was wearing a  

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,800
navy blue cocktail dress, and the men were wearing 
tuxedos, black ties and formal dinner suits.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,280
Eddie noticed how young the woman looked. Too 
young to have known the tune when it first  

79
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,440
appeared, Eddie thought, but her voice was strong 
and clear. And she seemed to believe in the words,  

80
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,760
at least. How old was she? Twenty-five? 
Twenty-six? Imagine singing on a cruise  

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,120
ship in your twenties! What a life! 
The fun, the parties, the people.  

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,200
The places to go and things to see 
- before your life had even started.

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,320
It seems so easy now, Eddie thought. His twenties 
had been very different. And his thirties.  

84
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,120
Eddie tried not to think about his own past. Now 
was all that mattered. The past was the past.  

85
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,200
'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,' 
Clive, his business partner, always said. 'No  

86
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,560
such thing as luck,' he once said, 'it's simply 
the moment when preparation meets opportunity.'

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,840
By now, Eddie was sitting back at 
his table and next to his wife.  

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,760
She was watching the band and tapping the table. 
She smiled at the other passengers opposite her,  

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,560
who smiled back, relaxed and enjoying the moment.  

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Eddie looked at his watch. It was almost 11 p.m., 
but he wasn't tired. Quite the opposite. He felt  

91
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,520
relaxed and energized. He'd always been 
an evening person, never a morning person.

92
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,360
He looked around at the giant lounge with 
its circular tables and well-dressed diners,  

93
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,960
and the perfect white tablecloths. The waiters 
and waitresses in their smart uniforms moved  

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,000
smoothly in and out of the room, and Eddie's 
eyes followed them as they carried plates  

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
and coffee and cakes and trays around the 
tables, along the aisles and past the bar.

96
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,520
Eddie watched the barman throwing ice cubes 
and cocktail shakers in the air and juggling  

97
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,840
them as he made the drinks in acrobatic style. 
He was confident and polished, and also young.  

98
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,200
Possibly the same age as the singer. 
Why was everyone so young these days?  

99
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,080
Where were all the cruise ship jobs when 
Eddie was trying to get started in life?  

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,320
Why hadn't he thought of working 
on a ship in the Caribbean?

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
He found himself staring 
at the bar in the distance.  

102
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
He was no longer thinking of anything 
in particular. He was simply listening  

103
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,840
to the sounds of jazz and the noise of a 
few hundred people talking and laughing.

104
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
And that was when he saw him.

105
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,160
That was the moment when he saw Dominic 
for the first time in many, many years.  

106
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,840
The man was sitting at the bar, leaning 
forward and smoking a large cigar.  

107
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,120
He was older now, clearly, and his hair was very 
grey, but Eddie had no doubt that it was him.  

108
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,880
He couldn't believe that awful 
man was here on the ship.

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,160
And then everything was different.

110
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,280
Nothing was the same. All was spoiled.

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
Just like before.
 
 
 

112
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,120
CHAPTER TWO

113
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Argument with Dominic

114
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
"You know your problem, Eddie?" 
said Dominic Stephens in his office.  

115
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,560
"You're too hands-on." He leaned back in his 
large, leather chair behind his glass desk. He  

116
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,840
seldom made eye contact. His shoulders 
looked tense and his neck was hidden.

117
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,840
"I don't understand," said Eddie. "How can that 
be a problem? The team really appreciates my style  

118
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,200
and the customers love it. It's what I do best. 
It's why I was brought here in the first place."

119
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
"Oh, really?" said Dominic, clearly unimpressed.

120
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,600
"I know for a fact that Ann and Gary 
didn't want an executive to run things.  

121
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,240
They wanted someone with practical experience, 
and drive - and lots of it. They said dull and  

122
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
uninspiring executives and 
managers have come and gone  

123
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
and there's been no direction, no 
feeling for the business. No passion."

124
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,520
"And you have passion?" said Dominic.

125
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,800
"Yes. Do you?"

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,960
"This isn't about me, Eddie. It's about you,  

127
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,360
and it takes more than passion to do 
this job. You need to be a leader."

128
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,320
"I am a leader," replied Eddie. "I've done it 
for years. My track record speaks for itself."

129
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
"Well, you can't do it all by yourself."

130
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,560
"I'm not trying to do it all by 
myself, Dominic. I'm building a team.  

131
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,080
I'm training new people. Resources 
are limited. It takes time."

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,080
"We don't have time, Eddie."

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,080
What did Dominic Stephens know about passion 
or time? wondered Eddie. The only passion he  

134
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,600
seemed to have was being in charge. And golf. 
He seemed to have a lot of time for that.  

135
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,280
He even kept his clubs in the corner 
of his office. And today was Thursday.  

136
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,080
On Thursdays he always left early to play 
golf and he didn't even try to hide it.

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Eddie was so angry his mouth was dry. "I 
don't know why you have a problem with me,  

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Dominic. There's nothing wrong with my 
performance. Quite the opposite in fact."

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,880
"Oh, really?"

140
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,000
"Yes. When I joined Fenton's, they were only 
producing software for small businesses in the UK.  

141
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
They had some accounting packages and sales 
and marketing databases, but not much else.  

142
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,880
I was brought in to expand the business and 
build exports, and that is exactly what I have  

143
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,440
done. I brought in some very talented people to 
develop our products, and we now offer some unique  

144
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,720
and very powerful programs used by the biggest and 
best companies globally. When I proposed and won  

145
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,600
the Moscow account, you said it couldn't be done, 
and now we supply the entire Russian region."

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,400
"Erm, excuse me, Mr Passion. I won the 
Moscow contract for you," said Dominic,  

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,160
pointing firmly at his own chest.

148
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,320
Eddie could not believe his ears. This was so 
unfair. Rage filled his whole mind and body.  

149
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,560
"You did not win that contract. You knew some of 
the people in the Russian state department there,  

150
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,560
that's all. I spent most of last year - and the 
year before - going to Russia and working long,  

151
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,280
long hours to build a business plan that would 
work. Don't take the credit away from me,  

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,480
Dominic. Without me, this company could 
never have won such a high-profile project."

153
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,320
"Well, I still haven't seen the final numbers, 
and I still haven't seen the new business plan,"  

154
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,280
Dominic said, throwing his arms around.

155
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,560
"Yes, you have. I've kept you informed 
the whole time with numerous emails."

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,080
"Oh, emails, emails! I don't have time for 
emails. I get about three hundred a day.  

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
How on earth can I keep up with all that?"

158
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,240
Well, it would help if you didn't play so much 
golf, Eddie wanted to say. It would help if you  

159
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,800
let me do my job and didn't interfere. It would 
help if you weren't so aggressive. Instead,  

160
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,200
he tried to remain diplomatic and said, "Well, if 
you don't read my emails, how can we communicate?"

161
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,320
"Simple. Pick up the phone."

162
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,680
He made it sound so easy. This was ridiculous. 
"I do call you, Dominic. You're never there.  

163
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
I leave messages but you don't call 
back. When we do get time to meet,  

164
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't think you're really listening."

165
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
"I'm always listening to you, Eddie," 
said Dominic in a weary voice.  

166
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,800
"Because you talk so much, that's 
all you ever do. Talk, talk, talk."

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
"You're making personal comments, and that is 
not professional. I talk because I'm passionate.  

168
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
And I deliver. If I say I'll do something, I 
do it, and within budget, and you know it."

169
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
"You were not on budget. Last year 
you went over budget by 25,000 pounds"

170
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,600
Not this again. Eddie was so tired of 
the same story. "I can account for every  

171
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
penny my department spent. No one seems to 
know what happened to that 25,000 pounds."

172
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,200
Dominic looked at him accusingly.

173
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,480
"Don't look at me like that," said Eddie.

174
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,000
"Like what?"

175
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,600
"Look, the way I see it..." Eddie began, but 
again he was cut off in mid-sentence. Dominic  

176
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,960
always interrupted everyone. 
He was like a spoilt child.

177
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,000
And so the situation was 
impossible. Eddie simply wanted  

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
to leave. He could no longer 
focus. He could never win.

179
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,040
Eddie came out of the office. His whole body was 
trembling, and he tried very hard not to slam the  

180
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,920
door, scream or break something. He realized he 
was too angry and too upset to go back to the team  

181
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,880
or finish his work. He decided to slip 
out of the office for ten minutes,  

182
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,520
just to calm down. He would have a coffee. 
Or call Lynn. Come on, Ed, he told himself.  

183
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
Get things in perspective. It's only a job.

184
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,920
He was almost at reception and the main door, when 
Clive passed him on the way to the photocopier.  

185
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,440
"Ed, what's wrong?" he asked, 
stopping in the corridor.

186
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,520
Eddie couldn't speak. He was afraid to say 
anything, as he didn't know what might come out.  

187
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
His face was red and tears were 
stinging his eyes. He looked down,  

188
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,720
ignored Clive and walked out of the door into 
the street and towards the local cafe.
 
 
 

189
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
CHAPTER THREE

190
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
Someone from the past

191
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,640
"You all right, Eddie?" asked Lynn, who 
had noticed Eddie staring at the bar.  

192
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,240
Eddie took a moment and then said, "Yes, 
fine. Why?" But he was still lost in thought.  

193
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,080
He wasn't sure if the ship 
was moving or if he was dizzy.

194
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,520
"You look so serious. Come on, let's dance."

195
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,600
He was still staring at the bar. The man 
was still there. It was Dominic. Sitting  

196
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,480
at the bar barely fifty meters away, 
drinking and smoking. As simple as that.  

197
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,320
Was the world so small? thought Eddie. 
Couldn't it be a bit bigger? Why here?  

198
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,840
Why now? After all this time. Why on this ship? 
A familiar sickness in his stomach returned.

199
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,920
"Well, don't get too excited, will 
you?" Eddie heard his wife say.

200
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,600
"Sorry?" he said, turning his attention to Lynn.

201
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,560
"A dance! Can we dance?" Lynn said impatiently.

202
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
"Yes, sure. Sorry."

203
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,400
They both got up and walked to the dance 
floor. They held each other and danced  

204
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,720
slowly for the final verse of yet another 
song whose name Eddie couldn't remember.

205
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,240
Turning in the dance, Eddie was 
pleased that Lynn was there with him  

206
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,760
as he tried to take in the fact that he was now 
staring at the distant shape of Dominic Stephens,  

207
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,360
on the far side of the ship's dining room. 
The man, Eddie saw, now turned to watch  

208
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,400
the dining room and the dancing. He was 
hidden in a fog of his own cigar smoke.  

209
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,200
How Eddie had hated him. And how, after 
all this time, he still hated him.

210
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,560
The memories.

211
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,840
The anger.

212
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,120
The pain.

213
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,640
"Are you sure you're feeling 
all right, Eddie?" asked Lynn  

214
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
when they got back to their cabin. Eddie 
was sitting on the bed staring into space.

215
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,760
"Yes. Just tired. I think I'm still jet-lagged, 
and I'm tired after walking on the island today."

216
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,060
"You sure?"

217
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,100
"Yes."

218
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,560
"That trip on the glass-bottomed 
submarine was amazing, wasn't it?"

219
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,040
"Yeah," said Eddie. But he 
still couldn't think straight.  

220
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,880
His mind was filling up more and more with the 
terrible realization that Dominic was on the ship.

221
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Lynn knew him too well. "Eddie," 
she said, sitting down beside him,  

222
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,080
taking his hand and looking at him. She 
stroked the back of his head. "What's wrong?"

223
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,640
Eddie had decided to accept 
that the trip was now spoiled.  

224
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,320
Did he need to spoil it for his 
wife? She didn't have to know.  

225
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,640
They would have their luxury cruise and go home 
to a new life. The ship was big enough. Dominic  

226
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,680
and Eddie both looked older and Dominic probably 
wouldn't even remember him, so why worry about it?

227
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,800
But all the old feelings were there 
again, and Eddie could sense his energy  

228
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,920
slipping away just thinking about it. It 
showed on his face and Lynn could see it.  

229
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,840
Eddie could never hide much from his wife, and 
before he knew it he found himself weakening.

230
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,000
"It's Dominic. He's on the ship." It sounded 
so strange to Eddie to even say those words.

231
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
There was a pause.

232
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Lynn looked more closely at her husband.

233
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
"What?" said Lynn quietly. 
"Dominic Stephens? You're kidding."

234
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,840
"I'm not kidding, Lynn. I wish I was," said Eddie.

235
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
"I haven't heard that name in a long time."

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
"Well, he's here."

237
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
"How do you know he's here?"

238
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,000
"I saw him. He was sitting at the bar this 
evening when we came in from the deck."

239
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,880
"Eddie, we were sitting on the other side 
of the dining room - you could hardly see  

240
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,280
anything. How can you be sure it was him?"

241
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
"Oh, I'm sure, Lynn. No mistake.  

242
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,680
The same fat, lazy bloke. But less 
hair now. And grey. And fatter."

243
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,000
Lynn was still trying to take it in. 
"Dominic Stephens is on this ship?"

244
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,540
"Yes."

245
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
She waited a moment. "Oh, Eddie."

246
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,320
They both sat there for a moment. Then Lynn 
spoke again. She was already recovering.  

247
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,280
"Well, look, it's a long time ago, 
Ed. It doesn't matter any more.  

248
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,320
He doesn't matter any more. He's 
nothing. You don't have to talk to him."

249
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
"I know."

250
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,040
"It's a big ship," Lynn continued. "It's 
extremely unlikely you're going meet him..."

251
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,840
"I saw him at the bar!" said Eddie.

252
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,760
"... and even if you met him by chance, 
as I said, he won't remember you."  

253
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Then she looked closely at Eddie and asked 
softly, "You didn't speak to him, did you?"

254
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,880
"No," replied Eddie. "Of course not."

255
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
"And did he see you?"

256
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,640
"No." Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic 
had seen him or not. Probably not.  

257
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,320
"Well, that's OK then," Lynn said, but 
she knew it was an unhelpful thing to say.

258
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,320
"It's not OK, Lynn. It's not 
OK at all. That man is back."

259
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,880
"He's not back. Try to calm down."

260
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,520
"Calm down?!" said Eddie, raising his voice and 
standing up. "We lost everything because of him,  

261
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,040
Lynn, everything - he cheated and 
bullied and took it all away!"

262
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,920
"Yes, I know, Ed, but it was sixteen years ago.  

263
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,640
We've come a long way since then. You and Clive 
have each just put ten million quid in the bank!"

264
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,480
"So what? Dominic got away 
with it all at Fenton's!"

265
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
"It's all in the past. It doesn't matter anymore."

266
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,080
"It does matter. He's still getting away with 
it. He still looks very pleased with himself."

267
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,400
"You don't know that.  

268
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,320
You don't know his life now. I can't believe 
we're talking about all this after so long."

269
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,640
"Because he's here, Lynn. 
On the ship. On our cruise!"

270
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,120
"Eddie, listen to me. Calm down. He and Neal 
gave you a bad time, I know. But you fought back  

271
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,680
and survived, and you became successful anyway. 
Without him. In spite of him and the things he  

272
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,480
said and did. You're here with me now, on holiday, 
with financial security for the rest of our lives.  

273
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,280
You did it. You climbed back out of the hole 
and it's OK. He can't hurt you anymore."

274
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
"He nearly destroyed us, Lynn."

275
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,840
"But he didn't, did he? We didn't let him."

276
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,880
Eddie wiped the tears from his eyes. 
"I can't believe he's on board! Why?  

277
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,760
He's still out there getting in 
the way. Spoiling everything."

278
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,760
"He's not spoiling anything. Only if you let him. 
You've come a long way since he pushed you out."

279
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,240
"So why do I suddenly feel so angry? 
I can't believe it. I think of him and  

280
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,200
those days at Fenton's from time to time, 
sometimes a lot, and it never upsets me.

281
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,240
"Well, you went through a tough time. It was 
very hard. If you really did see him tonight,  

282
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,600
of course that's going to upset you. It's 
not the same as the occasional memory."

283
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,040
"Oh, I saw him all right. He still 
smokes those hideous cigars."

284
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
"OK," said Lynn.

285
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
"You went through it too, 
you know," he reminded her.

286
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,020
"I know."

287
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,000
Another pause.

288
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,360
"We lost so much, Lynn: the house, the money. 
Us. I was off sick for a year. A year!"

289
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,320
"I know," said Lynn. "There's no getting away 
from the damage the man caused. But you have  

290
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,720
to calm down. Nothing is going to happen. You 
don't have to see him again or talk to him."

291
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,240
"Well, what if he takes the same excursion as us 
at some point? Or sits at our table for dinner?"

292
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,360
"Eddie, there are almost 2,000 
people on board. It won't happen.  

293
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,160
We can ignore him. Being the sort of person 
Dominic is, he's probably treated lots of  

294
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,960
people the way he treated you, so he won't 
know who you are or remember what he did."

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,600
"Somehow that makes it worse."

296
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,000
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it. 
If we see him again or he even recognizes  

297
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,120
you, we'll cross that bridge 
when we come to it, all right?"

298
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,280
Eddie was quiet.

299
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,560
"All right?" Lynn repeated, 
holding his face in her hands.

300
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
"OK," said Eddie.
 
 
 

301
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,200
CHAPTER FOUR

302
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
After the argument

303
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Eddie sat in a cafe not far from the office, 
dipping his teaspoon into a large cappuccino,  

304
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,320
and tried to think of what he could do about his 
job. He could leave, but that would mean giving in  

305
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,320
and letting Dominic have exactly what he wanted. 
Besides, it would take several months, possibly a  

306
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,480
year, to find another good job, and he would still 
have to put up with him in the meantime. He could  

307
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,000
officially complain about Dominic's behavior. He 
had a strong case. But that would only make things  

308
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,440
worse. Somehow Dominic had Gary, the CEO, on 
his side. And Ann Blake, the Financial Director,  

309
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,600
would never support getting rid of Dominic, 
since she had hired him in the first place.

310
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,720
"He's unbelievable. He actually said 
I was too hands-on," said Eddie,  

311
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
stabbing at his drink with his spoon.

312
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,160
"Really?" said Clive, who had left the 
office and found Eddie sitting in the cafe.

313
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,520
"Yes. He also said I wasn't a leader 
and that Moscow was his deal."

314
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,960
"You're joking," said Clive. 
He seemed genuinely surprised.  

315
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
"That deal was yours. Everyone knows that."

316
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,720
"Then he said my communication 
wasn't good enough."

317
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,480
"Eh? He can talk. He's got no people skills 
whatsoever. Anyway, he never reads his emails."

318
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,240
"I know. I told him that. He says I should 
phone him," and Eddie laughed in disgust.

319
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,080
"He's never there!"

320
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,240
"Exactly! I said that too. It's pointless, Clive. 
He doesn't listen and he interrupts all the time.  

321
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
He's so smug. He thinks he's 
right about everything."

322
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,480
"At least you're not alone. Everyone 
has the same problem with him."

323
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
"Well, what is his problem?"

324
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
"It's obvious. He's insecure."

325
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
"Well, it's not obvious when you're 
sitting in a meeting with him."

326
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,120
"He's a bully in a shirt and 
tie. All bullies are insecure.  

327
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,600
Maybe his dad didn't show him 
any love. Maybe his dad's worse!"

328
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
Eddie tried to smile as he 
looked out of the window,  

329
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,320
as if the answer were out there somewhere. 
Maybe if he were to look long enough,  

330
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,880
the answer would come and find him. 
He doubted it. He was exhausted.

331
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,040
"Clive, how do they get to be in charge, these 
people? They're utterly useless. He's useless."

332
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,760
"Yes, and he knows it. Deep down. That's why 
he picks on people and moves responsibility.  

333
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
No one actually knows what he does."

334
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
"Yeah, and by the time they find out 
they have to pay him a year's salary,  

335
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
and then he gets another job."

336
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
"That's his skill, though. He 
talks well to the top guys.  

337
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,840
But the real people don't respect him. I spoke 
to someone at Gallagher's the other week,  

338
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,040
where Dominic worked for about two 
years. They said the same thing."

339
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
"Do you think he has any idea what 
people really think and say about him?"

340
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:27,280
"No, I don't think he does. He's so superior in 
his own mind he probably thinks we're all losers."

341
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,560
"But he knows I'm good. He knows you're good 
too, and that really irritates him, because we  

342
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,600
know this job and he doesn't. He just moves tasks 
and people around all day and calls it strategy."

343
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,000
"I know," said Clive.

344
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,000
They both stared out of the window.

345
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,520
"Did you hear what he said to Steve the 
other day?" asked Clive. "No, what?"

346
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,960
"'Dominic told Steve that he got the top  

347
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,160
job because Ann and Gary saw 
him as a wise ambassador.'"

348
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,320
"Wise? Ambassador? Ambassador for what?"

349
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,680
"Who knows? He's in his own dream world."

350
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
"Did he really say that?"

351
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,600
"Yes. And when Steve questioned it, Dominic 
then said he was older than anyone else anyway."

352
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
"Unbelievable."

353
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,040
"Who knows what he thinks? He's not 
like us. I think that scares him."

354
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
"Where do these people come from?"

355
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,440
"I don't know, mate, but they soon 
move on. We just have to hold on.  

356
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Look on the bright side - 
it couldn't get any worse."

357
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,640
But Eddie wasn't so sure. Eddie had the feeling 
that things were going to get a lot worse.

358
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,320
And he was right.

359
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Back at home, Eddie spent the evening trying to 
catch up on the work he'd missed that afternoon,  

360
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,840
and looking at the many emails he 
had sent Dominic. It was a nightmare.

361
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,000
Again and again he considered walking away 
from the job, but it hurt him more simply to  

362
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,920
give up. Besides, he was enjoying the Moscow 
project, and he had done so much work for it.  

363
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,920
When he was in Moscow, he 
could get on with things. He  

364
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,280
loved Russia and he loved the people there. 
It was such a different world from the UK;  

365
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,160
and the owners of Zariya, Dima and Tatiana, always 
made him feel so welcome. Over time Eddie had  

366
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,720
had to explain to them some of the difficulties 
back in London, and they had been very helpful.  

367
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,000
Eddie was reading one of Dima's emails and 
smiling again when Lynn walked into the room.

368
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
"Will you be much longer?" asked Lynn.

369
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,920
"Maybe. I'm behind on some deadlines, and 
today's battle with Dominic didn't help."

370
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,440
"Just leave it now, Ed. Come to bed," said Lynn.

371
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,040
"I can't. There's so much. Too much."

372
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,800
"There's always too much," Lynn replied. 
"It will still be there in the morning.  

373
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,840
Give yourself a break."

374
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,320
"Yeah, well, that's true, but with Dominic I have 
to be extra careful. He picks on everything."

375
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,760
"He's an idiot."

376
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,440
"Yeah, I know it, and you know it, and everyone 
else knows it, but he's still the boss."

377
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,040
"Well, what I mean is just ignore him."

378
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,560
"How can I ignore him, Lynn? He's the 
boss! He runs the division. He runs me."

379
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,760
"Well, don't let him," said Lynn.

380
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,120
"I'm not letting him!" shouted Eddie. "I'm 
trying to stop him. That's the problem!"

381
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,560
"There's no need to shout, Eddie. I'm not deaf."

382
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,960
"Well, you're not being very helpful."

383
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,760
"Thanks a lot," she said 
sarcastically. "I'm doing my best."

384
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,280
"Sorry. I was hired to build a team, win a project 
like the one in Moscow and make things profitable.  

385
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,280
He was brought in to oversee the whole division. 
Then he gets bonuses for doing very little,  

386
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,240
and I get the blame when the 
numbers suddenly don't add up."

387
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,160
"Your numbers are fine."

388
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
"Not according to Dominic."

389
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,380
"Why?"

390
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,600
"Oh, well, during our useless meeting today, 
he brought up that old story about being 25,000  

391
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,720
pounds over budget, when everyone knows he fixed 
the numbers. Somehow he gets his bonuses and puts  

392
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,120
any blame on me. I'm almost certain 
now that he wants me out, Lynn."

393
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,920
"Surely not. He needs you. If it weren't for you,  

394
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,360
good people would have left ages ago. 
Besides, who else could move Russia along?"

395
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,120
"Oh, don't mention Russia."

396
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,320
"Why? That's your big success story."

397
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,000
"Oh, he keeps going on about the fact 
that he won the Moscow contract, not me."

398
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,960
"What? That's just not true."

399
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,260
"I know."

400
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,320
"What about Ann and Gary? Can't 
you talk to them about all this?"

401
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,480
"They've changed, Lynn. I've hardly seen 
them since the new partners came in.  

402
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
Besides, Gary and Dominic are 
always playing golf at the weekends.  

403
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,920
Ann's OK still, but she's very political, 
and I think she's embarrassed that Dominic's  

404
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,000
upsetting everyone. After all, she 
was the one who recruited him."

405
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,920
'And Human Resources? Can't 
you report him to them?"

406
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,080
"What do I tell them? That he's 
got the people skills of a goat!"

407
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,600
"Well, that's one thing. And the 
intimidation, the lies and the..."  

408
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,040
It's very hard to prove, Lynn. 
He's got his back covered,  

409
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,640
and they would only report the whole 
thing to Ann and Gary. And then what?"

410
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,840
"Well, presumably they tell Dominic and 
you all get together and sort it out."

411
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,320
"Easy, really. Why didn't I think of that?"

412
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,440
"You know what I mean, Eddie. 
There's no need to be sarcastic.  

413
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm only trying to help. I 
hate it when you're like this."

414
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,560
"Well, you're not living in the real world, 
are you, Lynn? You're a Primary school teacher,  

415
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,280
for goodness' sake. If things go wrong, you 
all get into a circle and sing a song about  

416
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,160
it. Or draw a picture. It's not that simple when 
you're in a multi-million pound business and..."

417
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
But Lynn had heard enough.

418
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:14,240
She was already leaving the room. Eddie stared 
back at the open screen on his laptop at hundreds  

419
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,840
and hundreds of emails. He thought about how 
much more he had to do before he could go to bed,  

420
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,080
about the hurt he had caused Lynn and about the 
injustice of Dominic and of people like him.

421
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,360
Eddie slammed down the laptop lid.

422
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,680
The job was broken, the evening was broken, 
and now his relationship was broken.
 
 
 

423
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
CHAPTER FIVE

424
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Eddie's dream

425
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,440
Although the sea was calm, 
Eddie didn't sleep well.  

426
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
He had a dream that seemed to last all night.

427
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,240
It began with him lying in 
bed in the cabin of the ship,  

428
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,480
and waking up to find himself in 
his old bedroom from his childhood.  

429
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,840
But the bedroom was on the ship. He sat up in 
the top bunk of some familiar bunk beds. In the  

430
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,080
bottom bunk should have been his sister Ellen, 
but he knew his wife was the occupant now. The  

431
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,680
bottom bunk was empty, however, and he saw water 
coming in quietly but rapidly under the door.

432
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,840
In his dream, he jumped out of his bunk 
and straight into half a meter of water.  

433
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,240
It was ice-cold and Eddie gasped in shock. He was 
wearing a grey suit and black shoes, but no socks,  

434
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,880
shirt or tie. With his feet already going numb 
in the cold water, he opened the small wardrobe  

435
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,760
to look for them and found a public telephone. 
Business cards were stuck all over the wall. He  

436
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,160
noticed his own from years ago with the familiar 
Fentons logo. But his details were in Russian.

437
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,440
His stomach was tight.

438
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,880
His head ached.

439
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,800
In his dreaming mind, a thousand tasks and 
deadlines seemed to weigh upon his shoulders.

440
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,680
The phone started ringing. He picked it up.

441
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,520
"Where are you?" a voice shouted on the other end.

442
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,240
It was Dominic.

443
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,760
"The unmistakable, cold, demanding tone 
of voice: "Do you know what time it is?"

444
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,960
Eddie lifted the sleeve of his suit to look at his 
watch, but its face was frosted over and unclear.  

445
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,400
Water had got into it somehow. 
The hands were barely visible.

446
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
"I can't tell," he heard himself say.

447
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
"You can't tell the time?  

448
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,920
Typical! What's the matter with you? 
We're all waiting for you. Come on."

449
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
"Who's waiting for me? Where are you?"

450
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,600
Eddie heard laughter in the background.

451
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
"On the bridge. Where do you 
think?" Then the line went dead.

452
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,440
The water was up to Eddie's knees now, and rising 
fast. He decided to leave the socks, shirt and  

453
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,320
tie and make his way to the bridge - dressed 
or not dressed. How much worse could it be?

454
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,840
As Eddie opened the door, water poured in at waist 
level, and with it thousands of champagne glasses.  

455
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,800
Most of them were intact, but many 
were broken. Too many for Eddie to  

456
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,240
avoid. His chest and legs were cut many 
times as he waded out into the corridor.

457
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
He saw Clive at the far end.

458
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,200
"Clive!" he shouted. "Clive, it's me! Over here!"

459
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,040
But Clive didn't hear him. He, too, was 
struggling with the strong current of water  

460
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,840
dragging him down and away at 
the far end of the corridor.

461
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,840
"CLIVE!" shouted Eddie in his sleep.

462
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,680
Opposite Eddie in the dream was a metal ladder 
which went up to the next level of the ship  

463
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,320
through a small hole. It was big 
enough for him to get through.  

464
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,680
This ladder led to another 
ladder and another hole.  

465
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,400
And another. And another. Ladders stretched all 
the way in a giant tunnel leading upwards. Eddie  

466
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,920
climbed and climbed. He could hear the laughter 
getting louder, so he decided to follow the sound.

467
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,560
When he reached the top, he suddenly 
found himself on the ship's funnel.  

468
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,320
It was dark, and a strong sea wind took his breath 
away. He was scared and excited at the same time.  

469
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,520
He thought the funnel would 
be hot, but it was not.  

470
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,520
It was at an angle, and he was looking up into 
the sky, almost touching the stars themselves.

471
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,240
"They're stars, Lynn. Not lights. You were wrong,"  

472
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,160
he shouted again (in reality, 
his shouting woke Lynn up).

473
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,000
Then he looked around and saw 
that the front part of the ship  

474
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,560
was already underwater and the ship was sinking.

475
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,840
"Lynn!" he shouted. This time it was a scream. 
That was when he slipped and fell and, in his  

476
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,120
sleep, flung out his arms to save himself. But 
there was no impact. Instead he was now standing  

477
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,680
on the bridge of the ship, which was full of 
people from work - from his days at Fenton's.  

478
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,040
People he hadn't thought of in all this time. 
People he thought he'd never remember again.  

479
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,160
People he certainly didn't want to see again.

480
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,320
Ann and Gary were there, but they were behind 
Dominic, who stood by the wheel in his captain's  

481
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,480
uniform staring at him. He was older now and 
heavier. The way Eddie had seen him at the bar.

482
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
"Glad you could join us. 
We're only sinking, you know!"

483
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,000
"What's going on?" said Eddie, looking around.  

484
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,720
The jazz band was playing in the corner, 
but the female singer was not the girl he  

485
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,440
had seen earlier. Instead it was Lynn. 
Singing a song whose name escaped him.

486
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,580
"Lynn?"

487
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,320
She didn't look at him. She 
was looking away and singing.

488
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,840
"LYNN! What are you doing here?" 
shouted Eddie, confused and frightened.

489
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,560
"I'm the captain. What does 
it look like?" said Dominic.

490
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,720
"No. Not you. Lynn. What's she doing 
here?" She wasn't paying him any attention.

491
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,240
More and more people were coming on to 
the bridge. He saw Dima and Tatiana.  

492
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,560
They spoke in Russian. Eddie couldn't 
hear them over the laughter of the crowd.

493
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,040
"Ssh. I can't hear what they're saying. 
And I can't remember the name of the song."

494
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,880
"Never mind that, Eddie. We've 
got more important things to do."

495
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,020
"What?"

496
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:12,980
Laughter.

497
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
"We're sinking, no thanks to you."

498
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,600
"Why? What have I done?"

499
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,840
More laughter from the crowd.

500
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,000
A familiar face appeared. It was Neal.

501
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,200
"Champagne glasses, Eddie. 
Champagne glasses," he said.

502
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,840
"What about them?"

503
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,600
What about them?" shouted Dominic. 
"They put a hole in the ship, you fool."

504
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,640
"That's impossible." Fear 
filled Eddie's mind and body.

505
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,760
"Oh, really? Take a look around. Glass 
everywhere. Holes in the side of my ship."

506
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
"It's not your ship!" protested Eddie.

507
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,640
"Who cares? We'll be underwater in ten 
minutes. Fifteen at the most," added Neal.

508
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,280
"Shut up, Neal. You're only 
here because of Dominic."

509
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,840
Then he heard a loud buzzing.

510
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,840
A giant helicopter arrived and flew over the front 
decks. And another. Three, four, five. Dozens.  

511
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:14,000
Like bees around a beehive. Buzzing, louder 
and louder. They flew around and shone powerful  

512
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,880
lights on to the bridge. So many lights. The 
noise and lights were unbearable. Then sirens.  

513
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,960
Police sirens. People screaming. Eddie covered 
his ears and shut his eyes. He cried out: "LYNN!"

514
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
The noise lessened but the 
lights were bright, so bright.  

515
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,160
He was trying to open his eyes, but he 
couldn't. Now someone was pulling at his arms.

516
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,360
"Let me go! Let me go!" he shouted.

517
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,080
"Eddie..." Lynn said, trying to wake him up.

518
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,320
"Lynn?" His eyes were opening. It was so bright.

519
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,560
"It's all right, I'm here," she said, holding him.

520
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,720
"We've got to get off! We're sinking!"

521
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,840
"It's all right," she said again.

522
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,160
Then his eyes opened and he was finally awake.
 
 
 

523
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,160
CHAPTER SIX

524
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,840
Another bad meeting

525
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,360
The next morning Eddie woke early and his mind 
was racing. The house was quiet and there was  

526
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:19,840
little traffic outside. He felt like he hadn't 
been to sleep at all, and he was still angry.

527
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,400
Lynn was still asleep. It was 5.50 a.m. He 
listened to the radio for a while until he heard  

528
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,480
the news, and then he got up, had a shower and 
got dressed. By 6.45 a.m. he was ready for work  

529
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,440
and quickly said goodbye to Lynn before walking to 
the station to get the train into central London.

530
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,320
The train was full, but Eddie 
managed to get a seat by the window.  

531
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,240
It was a fast train with only a 
couple of stops before Paddington.  

532
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
As the train picked up speed and aimed for 
the city, Eddie looked out at the fields  

533
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,200
and industrial estates passing by. He took deep 
breaths and tried to calm himself before the day  

534
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,600
started. He thought about his conference call 
with Moscow at 9.30 a.m., his scheduled sales  

535
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,640
meeting at 12 noon, and a lunch appointment at 
1.30 p.m. with Neal Skinner in Production. Then  

536
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,680
he was hoping to block off a couple of hours in 
the afternoon to catch up on emails and paperwork.

537
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,480
He got to the office at 8.15 a.m. and sat at 
his desk with a double espresso and a bagel.  

538
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,040
As his PC started up, Eddie sorted through some 
of his papers and wrote a quick to do list for  

539
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,240
the day ahead. He logged on to his email and took 
care of a few basic queries, before noticing that  

540
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,880
Dominic had sent a meeting schedule for 10 a.m. 
There was no subject heading. Eddie saw that it  

541
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,240
clashed with his Moscow call, so he rejected 
it and suggested rescheduling for 11 a.m.,  

542
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,080
and wrote a line to ask what the meeting was 
about. To support his message, he mentioned  

543
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,600
that he had an important call at 9.30 a.m. and 
asked Dominic for his patience in the matter.  

544
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,440
It annoyed him to think that his day with 
Dominic was already starting on a negative note,  

545
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,840
but he tried to put it to the back of his mind.

546
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,640
By 9 a.m. the open-plan office was filling 
up, and Maxine, Paula and Gavin arrived,  

547
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,320
who all worked in Eddie's department 
and sat near him in the office.

548
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,360
"Hi, Ed! How's it going?" asked Paula.

549
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
"Fine, thanks," replied Eddie.

550
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,600
"How was the meeting with Dominic yesterday?" 
asked Gavin. "Oh, well, you know. A challenge,  

551
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,080
shall we say," said Eddie, trying 
to smile and not give too much away.

552
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,600
"I bet it was. Rather you 
than me, mate," said Gavin.  

553
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,840
Eddie knew that Gavin and the team were 
on his side, but what could they do?

554
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,000
Eddie went back to dealing with his emails and 
preparing for the call to Moscow at 9.30 a.m.

555
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,120
At 9.20 a.m. his phone rang. It was Dominic. 
"Did you get the meeting schedule I sent?  

556
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,240
10 a.m. this morning."

557
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,440
"Yes, I replied. I can't do that time. I've got 
a call at 9.30 with Dima and his team in Moscow.  

558
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,800
I'm dialing in Adam in IT, who needs an update on 
the platform they're using for the new software."

559
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,040
"It's too early for IT. Why are 
you bothering them with this?"

560
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,360
"Because we need their input on..."

561
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,760
"Look, Eddie. Forget IT and 
forget your call. Do it tomorrow."

562
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,320
"I can't. It's taken ages to 
find a time when we can all..."

563
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,880
"You and I have a meeting at 10."

564
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,920
"What about?"

565
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,080
"Let's discuss that then. OK?" Dominic hung up.

566
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,720
Eddie glanced around and 
noticed Maxine looking at him.

567
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,480
"You OK?" she asked.

568
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,120
"Not really. Max, can you get hold of Dima for me  

569
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,320
and ask if he can reschedule the 
call for any time this afternoon?"

570
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,880
"He won't like it," she said.

571
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,480
"I know. Tell him I'm really sorry, and 
tell him Dominic has to see me at 10 a.m.  

572
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,600
Tell him I didn't have any 
warning. He'll understand."  

573
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,000
Eddie tried to smile again. This smile was more 
fake than the last, and Maxine could see it.

574
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,000
"OK," she said.

575
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,760
Eddie calmly got up out of his seat and walked 
across to the far side of the office floor,  

576
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,320
took the lift upstairs and went into 
the gents' toilet. It was empty.

577
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,840
He went to the sink, turned on the cold tap,  

578
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,240
collected water in his cupped hands and 
splashed it on his face to freshen up.  

579
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,320
The situation was impossible, he thought. 
Eddie felt he could no longer do his job.

580
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,920
For a moment or two he stayed where 
he was, leaning over the sink,  

581
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,280
staring at the pouring water and 
watching it go down the plughole.  

582
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,200
Then he looked up, reached for 
some towels and dried his face.

583
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,080
At that moment the phone in his 
pocket announced the arrival of a text  

584
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,120
with the sound of a mystical 
harp. It was from Lynn.
 
 

585
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,840
sorry about last night, hope u r ok. stay strong.  

586
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,360
D is a useless robot and 
he knows it. love u. L. x
 
 

587
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,120
Eddie smiled and punched back a quick reply:

588
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,240
thanks, love u 2. X
 
 

589
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,040
The text and cold water seemed 
to give Eddie enough strength  

590
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,200
to go back and face another meeting with Dominic.  

591
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,520
It was almost ten o'clock. He had enough time to 
grab a coffee before going to Dominic's office.

592
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,640
Eddie knocked on the door, walked in and sat 
down. Dominic was engrossed in something on his  

593
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,280
PC. Without looking up he muttered, "I'll be with 
you in a moment," and spent the next five minutes  

594
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,960
doing more work and ignoring Eddie. He even made 
a phone call to someone Eddie had never heard of.  

595
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,480
Eventually, Dominic turned his attention 
away from his computer and on to Eddie.

596
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,360
"Right. What's the latest from Moscow?"

597
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,920
"I haven't called them yet."

598
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,840
"Why not?" Dominic's tone was sharp. Eddie was 
always amazed at how unpleasant and cold this  

599
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,520
man was. Was he like this at home? What kind of 
friends did he have? Did he have any friends?

600
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,200
"I had a call planned for this morning at 9.30,  

601
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,920
but you asked me to change it so 
that we could have this meeting."

602
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,760
"So when are you talking to them?"

603
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
"I don't know yet," said Eddie.

604
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,040
"You need to get a call 
sorted as soon as possible."

605
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,880
"Maxine's doing that now."

606
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,360
"Maxine shouldn't be doing that 
sort of thing. She's only a temp."

607
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,800
"Well, she sometimes takes phone calls for 
us in the office and sets UP meetings."

608
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,320
"She's not a secretary, Eddie, she's a student!  

609
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,880
She types in data. You can't ask her 
to phone our biggest customers..."

610
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,160
Eddie's face was red, he could feel 
it. Already things were out of control.

611
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,240
"She's only setting up a 
conference call," he said.

612
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,120
"Do it yourself," said Dominic impatiently.

613
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,960
"Fine," Eddie. It wasn't fine at all.

614
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,200
"And copy me in on the schedule. 
I want to join the call."

615
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,500
"Why?"

616
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,440
"I want to find out when Dima's going to order the  

617
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,000
rest of the software for all 
the offices in the region."

618
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,000
"Dominic, please leave that to me. This call  

619
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,840
is more for product training and 
looking at any specific problems so far.  

620
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
I don't want to distract him with pressure 
for more orders. We have time for that."

621
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,120
"We don't have time, Eddie."

622
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,520
"Yes, we do. At least until my next visit to 
Moscow. That's when we will be looking at the next  

623
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,640
orders. As a matter of fact I've got a meeting 
with Neal in Production today to look at costs."

624
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,160
There was a knock on the door and Neal Skinner, 
Head of Production, walked into the office.

625
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:46,800
"Well, well. Here he is!" said Dominic. "Come 
in, Neal. We were just talking about you."

626
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,240
"Nothing bad, I hope," said 
Neal. His smile was insincere.

627
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,680
He was a very tall, thin man who 
always looked pale and wore dull suits.  

628
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,000
The Grey Man, they called him in the office. 
Neal was Eddie's main contact in Production  

629
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
for all things related to the Moscow project.

630
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,800
He was a cold character who 
took himself very seriously  

631
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,640
and had little sense of humor. Like Dominic, 
he had a superior manner and was stubborn.  

632
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,960
When engaged in conversation he looked at the 
other person critically, judging them negatively.  

633
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,640
Neal always tried to give the impression that 
he knew everyone and that he was in charge,  

634
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,520
but it was clear he was not really comfortable in 
his role and didn't really know what he was doing.  

635
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,520
He hid behind business jargon, name-dropping 
and things he had learned from going on too  

636
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,720
many training courses. But bosses liked 
him. Employees and customers did not.  

637
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,360
They thought he was a waste of time. 
Eddie knew he was a waste of time.

638
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
"Neal, thanks for joining us."

639
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,400
"No problem," Neal replied. So 
agreeable. So good with a boss around.  

640
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,200
Neal crossed his long legs and folded his arms.

641
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,040
Eddie now had a feeling that 
this meeting had been arranged,  

642
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,680
and that Neal was part of it. It was no 
coincidence that he had turned up at that point.

643
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,960
"Did you see the match last night?" 
Neal asked Dominic. Still no smile.

644
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,040
"No, I missed it. I heard that new defender Slater  

645
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,400
scored an own goal and saved us. 
That was very kind, thank you."

646
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,160
"We're still five points ahead of you, though."

647
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,880
"Not for long. You've got Chelsea on Saturday, and 
then you're away to Liverpool the following week."

648
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,040
"Gentlemen," interrupted Eddie, "if it's OK 
with you... could we get back to business?"

649
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,440
"The thing is, Eddie," said Dominic, "we 
need more people on the Moscow account..."

650
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,960
Eddie wasn't sure where this was going, but he 
was slightly encouraged by the possibility of  

651
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,840
getting more assistance. "Right. That's 
good," he said, trying to be positive.  

652
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,000
"We're short-staffed, as you know, and we could 
use more help." But he still wasn't sure why  

653
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,040
Neal was there - he remained still and quiet, 
looking first at Dominic and then at Eddie.

654
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,040
"... so Neal has agreed to take charge and give 
you guys a hand." Dominic looked back at his  

655
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,680
computer screen, then tapped something 
on his keyboard. Eddie looked at Neal.

656
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,640
"Take charge of what, exactly?" 
he asked, looking back at Dominic.

657
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,320
"Take charge of the account. In 
Moscow." Dominic gave a little laugh.

658
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Eddie went cold. He could feel the sharp 
blade of realization enter his back.  

659
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,040
"Are you moving to Moscow, Neal?" 
he asked, confused but hopeful.

660
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,960
"No, mate. I'm staying in London." 
Neal smiled his superior smile.

661
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,840
Eddie did not like the sound of this. 
He didn't like being laughed at either.

662
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,680
Eddie turned his attention to Dominic. "Dominic, 
I don't quite follow. What's going on?"

663
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,000
"I've decided to make some changes in the team. 
Neal has a lot of experience in this field, so  

664
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,600
you will report to him. He is now Head of Product 
and Business Development. It's a new position."

665
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,040
Neal kept his eyes on Dominic the whole 
time. He looked very pleased with himself,  

666
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,160
as if he was waiting to be 
given a trophy of some sort.

667
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,800
'It makes sense, Eddie. Really," said Neal.

668
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,560
"I'm not interested in your 
opinion," snapped Eddie.  

669
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,120
He was trying to stay calm but inside 
he was ready to explode. He tried to  

670
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,400
keep his voice steady. He leaned forward on 
Dominic's desk and looked him in the eye.

671
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,840
"So what's my position?" he asked.
 
 
 

672
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,160
CHAPTER SEVEN

673
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,840
An encounter in Barbados

674
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:50,160
The Parvina docked quietly at Bridgetown, 
Barbados, at 7.20 a.m. Eddie and Lynn were  

675
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,400
already awake and they lay in bed listening to 
the radio. At 7.30 there was a knock on the door.

676
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,160
"Good morning. Breakfast," said the voice outside.

677
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,560
Eddie got out of bed, almost believing 
he would step into cold water once more,  

678
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,160
and opened the door. A young, smiling man 
brought in a large tray full of cereals,  

679
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,280
orange juice, pastries and a cafeteria of 
coffee. Eddie led him through the cabin  

680
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,200
to the balcony door, which he opened. 
The humid air struck him immediately.

681
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,720
"Phew, it's warm. Leave the tray 
inside," he said to the man.  

682
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,200
"Thanks." Eddie gave him a 
few dollars and the man left.

683
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,880
Eddie looked out across the harbour 
view to where blue sea met white sand,  

684
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,960
to the houses dotted about the town, and to 
the green palm trees inland. Market stalls were  

685
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
already being set up near the ship, where locals 
could sell souvenirs and fruit to the passengers.  

686
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,880
Eddie heard the distinctive metallic sound of a 
steel band and saw five boys playing down below.  

687
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,400
He could see at least three other ships 
in the harbour. Given his nightmare,  

688
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,680
he really appreciated the fact 
that this was the reality.

689
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,800
"Good morning, Mrs Millionaire. 
Another day in paradise," he said.

690
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,760
"What's for breakfast?" asked Lynn, yawning.

691
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,360
"Get up and have a look."

692
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,800
"You seem very awake and lively," she said.

693
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,680
"Yes, well, after last night's trip to 
hell and back, this comes as a relief."

694
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,800
"You were in a terrible state. Do you remember?"

695
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,160
"Yes. I'm trying not to think about 
it," said Eddie. And he really was  

696
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,800
trying not to think about it - about 
the dream, about Dominic Stephens,  

697
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,040
about the real nightmare of sixteen years 
ago. But he knew it wouldn't be easy.

698
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,320
"Damn him," he said under his breath.

699
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,880
Lynn and Eddie had decided to do different 
things that day. Eddie had chosen to go  

700
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,440
on a catamaran and snorkeling trip in the 
morning, while Lynn had booked tennis lessons.  

701
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,800
They took a taxi to the Tropical Beach 
Hotel and Spa, where they were welcomed  

702
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,280
with fruit punch and given a short talk 
about the area by one of the hotel guides.

703
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,280
The catamaran was scheduled to depart from 
the hotel's private beach at 10.30 a.m.,  

704
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,800
and Eddie put on his life jacket and joined 
several other passengers and hotel guests  

705
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,640
for the two-hour trip. He was given a mask, 
snorkel and fins, and he waved to Lynn as  

706
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,520
he walked down to where the boat was tied 
up. He was carrying his deck shoes and had  

707
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,640
a towel in his hand as he made his way, 
barefoot, across the fine, smooth sand.

708
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,720
As he waited his turn to get on board, 
he looked down at his feet in the warm,  

709
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,320
green water and thought again about 
the nightmare and about Dominic.  

710
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,160
He wondered where Dominic was today. Was 
he on a trip? Was he even still on board?

711
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,280
In the taxi on the way to the hotel, 
Eddie had worried that Dominic would  

712
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,400
be on the same excursion. But how likely 
was it that he would meet him? He started  

713
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,080
feeling angry again that Dominic was on 
the ship. And that he still existed at all.

714
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,400
In spite of this, Eddie was able to 
relax during the boat trip. After  

715
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,040
an hour of sailing around the bay and 
past some spectacular beaches and coves,  

716
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,840
the catamaran dropped anchor and the small 
group went snorkeling near an old shipwreck.  

717
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,120
They watched and fed some stingrays, and 
Eddie enjoyed the calming effect of being  

718
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:27,280
below the surface and in a very different world 
underwater. He was a good swimmer and very fit.  

719
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,640
He had swum for his school and his university, 
and he had won medals for long-distance swimming.  

720
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,280
Even now, at home, he tried to get to 
the local pool at least twice a week.

721
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,560
When he got back to the beach hotel, 
he was feeling tired but refreshed.  

722
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,400
He'd caught the sun too, and his forehead and 
nose were burnt. He found Lynn sitting on a sun  

723
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,760
lounger by a small pool with fountains. She 
was reading and sipping another fruit punch.

724
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,240
"Hello, you. I thought I'd 
find you here," he said.

725
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,600
"Oh, hi. How was it?"

726
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:00,960
"Brilliant."

727
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,200
"You've caught the sun."

728
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,120
"I know. I forgot to take some decent sun block.  

729
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,080
I borrowed some off the guys on the 
boat, but I think it was too late."

730
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,680
"Here," she said, reaching for some cream in 
her bag. "Use some of this." She passed him  

731
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,840
a tube of cream and Eddie squeezed some 
into his hand and rubbed it on his face.

732
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
"How was the tennis?" he asked.

733
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,960
"It was cancelled. The guy never turned up, 
and it was too late to get another trainer."

734
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,800
"Really? That's not good. 
We've already paid for it."

735
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,280
"I know," said Lynn, "but they're 
giving us lunch for free instead,  

736
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,000
so I don't mind really. I'm booked for tennis 
again in St Lucia in a few days, so that's OK."

737
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,880
He mocked her: "Listen to you! I 'm booked 
for tennis again in St Lucia in a few days,  

738
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,840
she says, sipping her cocktail." 
Then he said, "This is the life, eh?"

739
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,200
"It certainly is. Oh, look, here's Jen."

740
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,480
"Who's Jen?" asked Eddie, looking 
around. He thought she looked familiar.

741
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,240
"She was booked for the tennis as 
well, so we came here for a drink  

742
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,200
instead and we started chatting. 
You'll never guess who she is."

743
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,080
"I know her, don't I?" asked Eddie.

744
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,880
"Yes and no. The same thing happened 
to me when I first saw her."

745
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,080
"She's from the ship. She must be," he said. Jen 
was almost at the pool where they were sitting.

746
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,480
"Yes. Not only that. She's 
the singer in the band!"

747
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,760
"Oh yes!" said Eddie, turning to meet her. 
She had on wide sunglasses and a baseball cap.  

748
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,720
She wore a colourful sarong with palm 
tree patterns, and her T-shirt was orange  

749
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,160
with a black saxophone logo. She was carrying a 
drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other.

750
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,240
"Hi, Lynn. Is this your man then?" asked Jen.

751
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,600
"Yes, this is Eddie. Eddie, this is Jen."

752
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,600
"Nice to meet you, Jen," 
Eddie said, shaking her hand.

753
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,520
"Likewise," she said. "How was the boat trip?"

754
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,040
"Great, thanks. They took us around some fabulous  

755
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,720
beaches. Then we stopped and swam 
off the reef near an old shipwreck."

756
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,800
"Cool!" said Jen.

757
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,400
"Some stingrays came by and we 
were given some food for them."

758
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,920
"Oh, I'd love to do that, but 
I'd be terrified," said Jen.

759
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,600
"They're not that dangerous actually, 
although they can give you a nasty bite."

760
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,360
"Ugh!" said Lynn.

761
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,080
"Or sting with their tail," added Jen.

762
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,080
"Yeah, well, that's true. It's 
rare, though," said Eddie.  

763
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,160
"That usually happens if you stand on one when 
they're buried in the sand in shallow water."

764
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,880
"Aren't you afraid of sharks?" asked 
Jen, lifting up her sunglasses.

765
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,640
"I try not to stand on 
sharks," said Eddie, smiling.

766
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,160
"You know what I mean."

767
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,280
"There weren't any in the area we were in,"  

768
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,160
said Eddie, sitting down on a 
sun lounger next to his wife.

769
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,720
"How do you know?" asked Lynn.

770
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,160
"Well, you don't. You have to 
hope that there aren't any."

771
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,640
"You must be mad," said Jen.

772
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,360
"It's worth it. The fish you can 
see near the reef are so beautiful."

773
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,440
"Well, Jen and I have been doing as 
little as possible, haven't we, Jen?"

774
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
"Absolutely," said Jen, sitting back 
on her lounger and sipping her drink.

775
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,120
"So, no tennis, then?" asked Eddie.

776
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,520
"No," said Jen. "But we get 
a free lunch," she added.

777
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,720
"So I heard," said Eddie. 
"What are you doing later?"

778
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,080
"Well, my partner will be here soon and 
we're booked to go on the Island Safari."

779
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,800
"Oh, I saw that in the brochure," said Lynn. 
"Is that the trip where you get a private jeep  

780
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,120
and go around the island and 
see the Wildlife Reserve?"

781
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,920
"Yes, that's it. I love all the animal trips. 
I can't wait. Dominic isn't keen at all,  

782
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:47,600
but he says he doesn't mind as long as he gets 
his golf, Typical! It's like he's married to the  

783
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:53,520
stupid game. I find it so dull. He loves 
it, though. Do you play golf, Eddie?"
 
 
 

784
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,160
CHAPTER EIGHT

785
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,200
Eddie's departure

786
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,200
"So, what's your position?" asked Clive 
later that evening at Eddie house.  

787
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,760
Eddie had come straight home after the 
meeting and no one had been able to reach him.  

788
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,320
Clive had been worried, and so he ha 
called in to see Eddie after work.

789
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,840
"That's what I said," replied Eddie.

790
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,040
"And what did he say?" asked Clive.

791
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:26,080
Lynn, clearly angry and upset, interrupted at 
this point to add, "Oh Clive, listen to this..."

792
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:34,080
Eddie was trying to stay calm. He was in shock. 
"He couldn't give me a straight answer. He went on  

793
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,880
and on about budget control, an Neal's experience 
in Austria when he was with Gallagher's."

794
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,920
"Neal doesn't do anything. And 
Austria is very different from Russia.  

795
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,520
Doesn't he realize that? This 
project is completely different."

796
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,440
"I know, Clive, I said all that. There was 
nothing I could say. When I got a chance to speak,  

797
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,200
he either didn't listen or simply 
interrupted. Or Neal joined in  

798
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,960
with a useless reason to justify 
himself. It was pathetic to watch."

799
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,800
"No one at Gallagher's has a 
good word to say about Neal,  

800
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,080
or the work he did in Austria. In fact, the rumor 
is that he was sacked because he messed it up.  

801
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,560
That's how he got into Fenton's in 
the first place. He needed a job  

802
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,160
and Dominic is an old mate of his 
from university. It makes me sick."

803
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:24,400
"I know." That was all Eddie could say. 
He was so tired. He rubbed his eyes.

804
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:30,000
"So there's no position for you?" asked 
Clive, but he could see the answer coming.

805
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,240
"Right," said Eddie.

806
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,400
"They're making you redundant, then?"

807
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,780
"No."

808
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,640
Clive was confused, and Eddie 
could not bring himself to say  

809
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,440
any more. So Lynn continued for 
him. "They fired him," she said.

810
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,840
There was a brief silence.

811
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,680
"They what"

812
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,840
"Can you believe it? It's disgusting," said Lynn.

813
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,760
Clive turned to Eddie. "I 
don't believe it," he said.

814
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,840
"Neither do I," said Eddie, staring into space.

815
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,520
"Fired for what?"

816
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,040
"He's using the issue about the 
25,000 pounds in last year's budget,  

817
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,440
but he also said I was a negative influence 
on the project and not hands-on enough'."

818
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,960
"You have got to be joking!" Neither Eddie 
nor Lynn said anything. It was no joke.

819
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,400
"You're very hands-on. The other day he 
said you were too hands-on, didn't he?"

820
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,800
"Exactly," said Eddie.

821
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,200
"And in what way are you negative? You are  

822
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,600
more enthusiastic and positive than the 
two of them put together," said Clive.

823
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,600
Eddie didn't say anything.

824
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,680
"He just wants a yes-man," continued Clive.  

825
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,720
"Neal is the true corporate yes-man. He 
plays the game and does what he's told.  

826
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,040
But he's useless otherwise, and too 
frightened to say anything and rock the boat."

827
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,120
"Who would want to be like that?"

828
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,160
"These guys think they're above everyone else.  

829
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,640
It's as simple as that. They have no idea 
what other people really think of them.  

830
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,480
They either scare you so you won't tell them, or 
they just talk over you in case they look weak."

831
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,840
"Meanwhile, Neal gets a job 
and Eddie doesn't," said Lynn.

832
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,800
"It's funny, but I really don't care 
anymore," said Eddie. "They deserve  

833
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,800
each other. I don't want to be a part 
of their grey world with their grey  

834
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:28,080
suits and grey ideas. They have no imagination. 
Only a selfish need to justify themselves."

835
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,640
"They can't do this, surely?" Lynn asked Clive.

836
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,320
"They can and they have."

837
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,560
"But it's unfair dismissal. You 
can take them to a tribunal."

838
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,760
"I'm not sure I can cope with that," said Eddie.

839
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,880
"But you have to," said Lynn. 
"You've got to fight it."

840
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,240
"All I do with him is fight. Now 
he has Neal to do his fighting.  

841
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,840
And he says he has the full support 
of Ann and Gary, so they're no help."

842
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,640
"You should have played more golf, 
Ed," said Clive sarcastically.

843
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,920
Eddie thought about that for a moment 
and then said, "Now that I have no job,  

844
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,320
maybe I'll have the time."

845
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,000
The next morning Eddie went into the 
office early again to clear his desk.  

846
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:17,200
There were only a few people there. He 
saw Adam from IT, who came over to him.  

847
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,720
He noticed Eddie was busy emptying drawers 
and throwing files and old documents away.

848
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,080
"Hi, Ed, how's it going? Doing a spring clean? 
Good man. Long live the paperless office!"

849
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,680
"Not exactly, Adam. I'm 
leaving, as a matter of fact."

850
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,320
"No way!" he said. "I had no idea."

851
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:41,200
"Me neither," said Eddie, reaching for a 
folder and glancing quickly at its contents.  

852
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,920
He got halfway through and then 
threw the folder into the bin.

853
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,760
"What's happened?"

854
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,400
"I was fired yesterday," said Eddie. The 
words sounded unreal when they came out.

855
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:52,900
"What for?"

856
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,040
"Oh, it doesn't matter."

857
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,560
"You're one of the best 
people here, Ed. I mean it."

858
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:06,080
"Thanks, Adam, but they don't want the best here. 
They just want..." Eddie stopped for a moment  

859
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:13,040
and looked across the office, deep in thought. 
"You know what, Adam, I have absolutely no idea  

860
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,160
what they want." He turned and looked at Adam. 
"And do you know what the worst thing is?"

861
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,660
"What?"

862
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,800
"They don't know either. My guess is they just 
want to be in charge. Nothing else matters.  

863
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,680
They just want to move people 
around and feel important,"  

864
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,720
said Eddie, slamming a cupboard door shut 
and pushing his chair away from the desk.  

865
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:38,880
"They don't think about the people, their work, 
their customers. They don't care about loyalty.  

866
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,080
They don't care about building a business. 
They talk, have meetings and play golf,  

867
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,400
but they don't know the business and 
they know they need us to make it work."

868
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,880
"You know your problem," came a voice from behind 
them. "You were never a corporate man, Eddie."

869
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,600
It was Neal. Eddie was 
completely taken by surprise.  

870
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,800
He was both embarrassed and 
furious to see him standing there.

871
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,920
Adam started walking away. "Look,  

872
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,680
Ed, I'll catch you later," he said. 
"Let's have a drink before you go, OK?"

873
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,960
"Sure," said Eddie, who decided to 
ignore Neal and finish clearing his desk.

874
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,600
"You need the skin of a crocodile 
in this business, I'm telling you."  

875
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,160
Eddie tried to ignore him and carried on throwing 
away files, paper, software manuals. Everything.

876
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:31,840
"Besides," continued Neal, 
"Dominic needs someone like me.  

877
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,400
Someone more... academic. He needs 
someone who can talk to him."  

878
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,720
Eddie stopped and looked at him. Was there 
no end to Neal's patronizing arrogance?

879
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,640
"Neal, you're deceiving yourself. Dominic wants  

880
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:51,120
a yes-man. Pure and simple. Now 
he's got one. Congratulations."

881
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,080
"You're upset."

882
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,840
"No, really? Amazing. How did you guess?"

883
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:00,320
"Look, I don't have a problem 
with you. It's nothing personal."

884
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,440
"That's so generous of you, Neal. I feel so much 
better," said Eddie, moving up close to him. He  

885
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:13,600
could smell Neal's stale cigarette breath. "Well, 
I have a big problem with you, and, believe it or  

886
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:21,200
not, I am taking this very personally. I guess I'm 
human, not a crocodile. What would you rather be?"

887
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,480
"I know how you feel," said Neal.

888
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:30,480
"You have no idea how I feel, and don't talk 
to me about how to talk to people like Dominic.  

889
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:37,120
He needs someone more academic, indeed. What does 
that mean? And corporate. What is corporate?"

890
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,880
"You have to play the game, Eddie."

891
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,360
"Maybe. But I'm not interested if 
the end result is turning into a grey  

892
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,440
yes-man like you. Ask yourself the question: 
are you true to yourself? I wonder."

893
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:57,360
"Nice, Eddie. Very professional," said 
Neal, finally showing his irritation.

894
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:03,040
"And you know all about professional, do you? 
Open your eyes. Really open your eyes. Listen  

895
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,320
to what people say about you. You're deceiving 
yourself and I actually feel sorry for you.  

896
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,960
And if you want a second opinion, go and ask 
people here or your old friends at Gallagher's."

897
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,320
Neal was walking away now, so Eddie shouted after 
him: "Did they give you a good reference, by the  

898
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:28,320
way? It wasn't redundancy, was it?" Eddie carried 
on putting things in his bag before sitting down  

899
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:33,840
to write an email to all his customers and 
colleagues to inform them of his departure.
 
 
 

900
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:35,840
CHAPTER NINE

901
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,400
The fight

902
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,880
As Dominic Stephens came out of the hotel towards 
them, Eddie froze. He looked at Lynn and her face  

903
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,880
said the same. Before they could make an excuse 
to leave, Dominic was already on the cafe terrace.  

904
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:56,080
His hair was grey and combed back, 
and he was wearing white trousers,  

905
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:01,920
grey golf shoes and a green polo shirt 
which was too tight for his large stomach.

906
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:08,000
It was definitely Dominic. The same hard face 
but now with a dark tan, though his chin and  

907
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,800
cheeks were fuller than the last time Eddie 
had seen him. He looked older and different.

908
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,120
"Hello, everyone. New friends, I 
see," he said, putting out his hand.  

909
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,080
In a reflex action, Eddie noticed 
his hand go out to shake Dominic's.  

910
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:29,840
He instantly felt he had betrayed himself. 
Dominic's handshake had not changed:  

911
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,520
his palm at an angle, the fingers locked tight, 
difficult to grip. Do Not Enter, it said.

912
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,560
Again, automatically, Eddie lifted 
his sunglasses to be polite,  

913
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,160
but Dominic kept his on. Eddie waited for 
the moment when Dominic would recognise him.  

914
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:53,040
But he did not. This cannot be true, he thought. 
Is this really Dominic? After all this time, am  

915
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,120
I shaking hands with him and he does not know me? 
He looked at Lynn, who was shaking his hand, too.  

916
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,320
Eddie could see that she 
was not comfortable either.

917
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,880
"Nice to meet you," she said, 
putting on her best smile.

918
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,840
"How was the tennis?" Dominic asked, 
leaning on the back of Jen's chair.

919
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,160
"Cancelled," she said. "Then I met Lynn and we've 
been working hard on cocktails since we got here."

920
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,440
"Ah, it's a hard life," he said.

921
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:28,160
Yes, thought Eddie. It can be very hard. 
And some people make it harder. His head  

922
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,320
was quickly filling up with flashes 
of memory. Angry words and images.

923
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,120
"So, what are you guys 
going to do?" asked Dominic.

924
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,640
"Er, we've got to get back 
to the ship," said Eddie.

925
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,160
"I thought you were staying 
for the free lunch," said Jen.

926
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,440
"Ah, there's no such thing 
as a free lunch, eh, Eddie?"

927
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,160
Eddie wasn't sure if Dominic had 
recognised him. Maybe. Maybe not.  

928
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,280
Or maybe he was unsure and was playing 
for time? He never showed much emotion,  

929
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,160
and behind the dark glasses 
he looked almost robotic.

930
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,240
"I don't really know," said Eddie. He 
was still trying to recover from the  

931
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,680
shock of Dominic standing there 
in front of him after so long.

932
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,920
"Sure. I've been in business twenty-five 
years and I can tell you no lunch is free."

933
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,400
"Right," said Eddie. "Right, 
well, nice to meet you both."

934
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,360
"Come on," said Jen, "stay for lunch."

935
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,440
"No, really, I've had too much 
sun, I think," said Eddie.

936
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,480
"Well, we can sit in the shade," said Jen.

937
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,400
"No, I mean I don't feel too well," Eddie said.

938
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,160
"Hmm..." said Dominic, finally lifting 
up his glasses and having a good look at  

939
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,680
Eddie's face, "... your nose is burnt, 
but you do look quite pale otherwise.  

940
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,160
You look like you've seen a ghost."

941
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:55,440
Eddie looked into Dominic's eyes. He did not 
see any signs of recognition. He looked away.  

942
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,600
"Right. Yes. Anyway. Lynn?" he said.

943
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,560
"Yes," she said, standing up. "I'm coming."

944
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,920
"Well, maybe we could meet for a drink 
after I finish tonight?" asked Jen.

945
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,120
"She's a great singer, isn't she?" said Dominic.

946
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,960
"Yes," said Eddie.

947
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,560
"Wonderful," said Lynn.

948
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,360
'I'm off at about eleven, so I'll come over 
to the bar and we can meet you both then."

949
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,800
"We'll see how Ed feels," said Lynn.

950
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:30,720
Sure. Well, tomorrow then? Or breakfast?" 
Dominic was laughing. "We're stuck together  

951
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,560
on the ship for the next two weeks, 
so there's no getting away, is there?"

952
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:41,440
Eddie had never imagined Dominic on holiday. He 
only remembered that Dominic always came back from  

953
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,920
holidays complaining about the children. "Ah, it's 
good to be back in the office," he used to say,  

954
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,440
"away, from the kids." Eddie felt sorry for 
Dominic's family whenever he heard him say that.

955
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,000
"What would his kids say if they heard him 
say that?" Eddie had once asked Clive. "Why  

956
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,440
did he have kids or a family at all 
if he preferred to be in an office?"

957
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,960
"Because these guys like to be the center 
of the universe, and kids and partners take  

958
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,240
that away from them. Besides, family life 
and kids are all about showing emotion,  

959
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,640
and they find it too scary. That's 
why they hide behind desks and power.  

960
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,640
Can you imagine Dominic or Neal 
trying to be with their kids?  

961
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:28,080
They don't know how. They probably didn't 
know how to be with kids when they were kids."

962
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,640
"That's so sad," Eddie had said.

963
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,160
"They are sad. They've missed the best things 
in life and think money and status are enough.  

964
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,560
But they are so superior in their 
own minds that they don't know it."

965
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,080
"So they're actually happy? 
Ignorance is happiness?"

966
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:50,480
"Maybe. I'm not so sure. How often do you 
see these guys relax, laugh or even smile?"

967
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:51,940
"True."

968
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,840
"Well, there's your answer."

969
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,800
"Eddie?" Lynn's voice suddenly brought Eddie 
back to reality. "Eddie? Are you coming?"

970
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,560
"Yeah. Sorry," he said. "See you guys later."

971
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,840
"Bye," said Jen and Dominic together.

972
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,720
Eddie and Lynn walked back 
through the hotel to the taxis.  

973
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,800
As they went back to the port 
and the ship, Lynn spoke first.

974
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,180
"Well?"

975
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,840
"He looks older. He's still 
got that arrogant look.  

976
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,840
And he's put on a lot of weight." 
Eddie glanced out of the window.

977
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,200
"Are they married, do you think? 
What happened to his wife?"

978
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,680
"Don't know," said Eddie. "I 
hope she left him. For her sake."

979
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,200
"I wonder what Jen is doing 
with a man like him, then?"

980
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,640
"Goodness knows. He's old 
enough to be her father."

981
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,360
The taxi moved along the harbour 
and passed the yachts in the marina.  

982
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,840
Eddie was shaking his head in disbelief.

983
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,600
"I don't believe it, Lynn," 
he said. "Can you believe it?"

984
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,760
"No. But at least he doesn't remember you," 
she said, looking at him. Eddie kept staring  

985
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:05,040
out of the window. "Do you think not?" he 
said. "Oh, come on. It's over sixteen years,  

986
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,880
Ed. If he had remembered you, he would 
have said something - don't you think?"

987
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,200
"Not necessarily. You never know 
with him. I never knew with him.  

988
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,840
He's a snake. A fat snake now, 
of course. But still a snake."

989
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,680
"Maybe he's changed," said Lynn hopefully.

990
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,640
"I doubt it."

991
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:29,600
The taxi slowed down and stopped near the gangway 
for the Parvina. They paid the driver and got out.

992
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,640
"It doesn't matter if he's an angel now. I'll 
never forgive him. The three things I hate  

993
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,520
most in the world are arrogance, bullying 
and betrayal. He's guilty of all three."

994
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,480
"Well, let's hope he doesn't remember 
you. We don't have to see them anyway."

995
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,040
"He's with the singer of the ship's 
band, Lynn - we'll see him every night!"  

996
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,600
Lynn walked in silence on to the ship and 
into the reception deck. What could she say?

997
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,360
That night Eddie and Lynn had dinner in the 
main dining room, which was full, as it was  

998
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:09,440
every night. As the sun went down and the room got 
darker, Eddie found it harder to see if Dominic  

999
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,160
was in the room or not. Throughout dinner he had 
expected him to turn up, but he was not there.

1000
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,880
As they finished dessert and 
drank their coffee, however,  

1001
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,680
Dominic appeared and took a 
seat at the bar to watch Jen.

1002
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,320
"There he is," said Eddie.

1003
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,000
"Oh yes. Well, maybe we could go 
back to the cabin, or the casino."

1004
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,960
"No, Lynn. We're not letting 
him push us around again."

1005
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,240
"But he'll soon see us and come over."

1006
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,800
"I doubt it. He was always antisocial."

1007
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,480
"Maybe he's changed."

1008
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,480
"You keep saying that. People 
like him never change."

1009
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,720
Eddie sipped his coffee and said, "I think 
I need to know for sure if he remembers me.  

1010
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,000
I'd feel a lot happier."

1011
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,240
"But why, Ed? What good will that do?" she asked.

1012
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,840
"I can't explain."

1013
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,960
"Eddie, please... Look, he's leaving 
anyway. He's not going to bother us."

1014
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,240
But Eddie had already got up from the table and  

1015
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,880
was walking over to the bar 
and the exit to follow him.

1016
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,040
He followed Dominic down the corridor and past the 
Starlight Lounge, where people were playing cards  

1017
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,960
and reading. He followed him through the door, out 
on to the side deck and to the stern of the ship.  

1018
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,600
It was dark, and Eddie thought he had lost him. 
But then he swelled the unmistakable cigar smoke  

1019
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:32,640
and he saw him. The earlier breeze 
had been replaced by a strong wind  

1020
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,440
and the sea was quite rough. He 
noticed Dominic in a small area,  

1021
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,760
alone, sheltered from the wind, leaning 
on to the rail and looking out to sea.

1022
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,360
"Hello," said Eddie, walking up to him.

1023
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,880
"Oh, hello there. Getting some fresh air?"

1024
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,720
"I suppose so."

1025
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,680
"Me too," said Dominic. 
"Feeling better?" he asked.

1026
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,200
"Yes, thanks."

1027
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,720
They both looked out to sea together for 
a long minute. Eddie broke the silence.

1028
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,240
"You don't remember me, do you?" 
he asked, looking at Dominic.

1029
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,880
"Yes, I just asked if you were feeling better.  

1030
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,880
We met at the hotel today. Your 
wife's tennis was cancelled."

1031
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,240
"No, not here. Back home. At work."

1032
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,040
"What do you mean?" asked Dominic, 
looking at Eddie. "Where?"

1033
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,960
Eddie knew Dominic had been in many 
companies. Creeping his way in,  

1034
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,840
then getting thrown out. Dominic called 
them redundancies. Others knew better.

1035
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,840
"Fenton's."

1036
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,520
Dominic looked at him and then looked harder,  

1037
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,720
using the light coming from the spotlight on 
the wall. "What's your surname?" he asked.

1038
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,080
"Munro."

1039
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,160
Dominic appeared to be trying to remember.

1040
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,320
"I was in sales. There was the 
big project at Zariya in Moscow."

1041
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,120
"Ah," said Dominic. "Eddie Munro.  

1042
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:06,960
Yes." He smoked his cigar some more, buying 
time. "When was that?" he asked finally.

1043
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,040
"Sixteen years ago."

1044
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,640
"Wow, good memory," said Dominic.

1045
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,480
"Not really..." said Eddie, "... you fired 
me and it's not something one forgets."

1046
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,360
"Did I?" and Dominic actually laughed. Over 
the years Eddie had imagined meeting him  

1047
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,280
again and confronting him. He had 
never imagined the man laughing.

1048
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,280
"You did, yes. You found a way to blame 
me for a budget loss of 25,000 pounds."

1049
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,200
"It's a long time ago. I honestly can't 
remember," said Dominic, still smoking,  

1050
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:46,720
looking back at the sea. Eddie was staring 
at him. His mouth was dry. He was trembling.

1051
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,280
"Well, I remember."

1052
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,160
"Good for you," said Dominic, 
and now his tone was changing.

1053
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,480
Less interested. Colder.

1054
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,480
"Actually, I remember you were an incompetent 
bully. You made my life miserable."

1055
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,680
Dominic turned around and looked at Eddie. 
"Is that so?" It was too dark to see if he  

1056
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,000
was angry or not. Eddie felt that the 
situation was getting out of control,  

1057
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,360
but there was no turning back. The 
words were coming out on their own.

1058
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,080
"I was very successful at 
Fenton's," said Dominic firmly,  

1059
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,840
"and one reason was probably because I was 
able to get rid of useless rubbish like you."

1060
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,480
"They fired you from there 
eventually, I heard. Why was that?"

1061
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,560
Dominic started walking away. "An 
interesting reunion, my friend, but it's late  

1062
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,720
and I'm bored with this conversation. I suggest 
you leave the past in the past and move on."

1063
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,960
Eddie grabbed his arm. He 
felt Dominic's body stiffen.

1064
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,840
"Get your hands off me," Dominic said, putting 
his cigar in his mouth to free his hand.

1065
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,040
"I moved on, Dominic. I moved 
on after you took away my job,  

1066
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,040
my money, my peace of mind and almost my wife."

1067
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,760
Eddie was angry now. The words 
were not coming out right any more.

1068
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,560
"I've seen your wife, Eddie,"  

1069
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,760
Dominic said, laughing. "I can tell 
you that you still need to move on."

1070
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,000
"What does that mean?"  

1071
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,840
This time Eddie pushed him against the rail of 
the ship and hit the cigar out of Dominic's mouth.  

1072
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:30,240
The light was shining on Dominic's face, and 
Eddie saw a mixture of surprise and anger.

1073
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:36,800
"Hey! What is your problem?!" he shouted, but they 
were out on deck in the wind and darkness and it  

1074
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,680
was like a whisper. Dominic pushed back against 
the rail, but Eddie would not let him move.

1075
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:49,600
"You! You are my problem!" Eddie shouted. He had 
no idea what he was doing any more. He was scared,  

1076
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,840
and angrier than he had been for a long time.

1077
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,520
"Move away, Eddie. This is unacceptable."

1078
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:03,760
"Unacceptable? Unacceptable? Oh, really? So, after 
all these years you know what is acceptable and  

1079
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,560
unacceptable. What you and Neal Skinner did to 
me was unacceptable. The way you patronized and  

1080
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:18,240
intimidated me was unacceptable. You cheated 
and lied. You were so smug, so superior."

1081
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:22,320
"I was the boss. I made tough 
decisions. You were a casualty.  

1082
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,720
It happens in business. Sink or 
swim, my friend. Get over it."

1083
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,600
Without thinking, Eddie brought his knee hard and 
fast up into Dominic's groin. Dominic shouted out  

1084
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:39,760
in shock and blinding pain, but was able to push 
his hand hard into Eddie's face. Eddie lost his  

1085
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:45,680
balance for a moment, giving Dominic time to stand 
up straight. Dominic pushed Eddie in the chest,  

1086
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:52,160
but Eddie did not feel it. He was too busy getting 
his hands around Dominic's neck. He squeezed and  

1087
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:58,240
squeezed, and Dominic tried to get himself free. 
But he could not. Eddie's hands were locked around  

1088
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Dominic's throat. He dug in his nails to be 
sure. He pressed his thumbs. Dominic was trying  

1089
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:09,040
to speak, but he couldn't. He choked out some 
words but Eddie could make no sense of them.

1090
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:17,520
"Just shut up! Shut up! You stupid... 
arrogant man!" Eddie growled at him.

1091
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,400
Eddie could finally see fear in 
Dominic's face, which had gone pale,  

1092
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,760
and his eyes stared back at him. Eddie could see 
he was going to pass out, so he loosened his grip.  

1093
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,680
What am I doing? he thought. This is madness.

1094
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,480
But the moment he let go, pain suddenly shot into 
Eddie's ear as Dominic threw a punch to the right  

1095
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:45,680
side of Eddie's head, and then to his right side 
into his ribs. Eddie was wild and angry once more,  

1096
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,480
this time pushing Dominic back on to the 
ship's rail. Hard against the rail. Fast  

1097
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,840
against the rail. Dominic shouting in pain 
once more. Eddie punching and punching.

1098
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:05,440
"OK, OK, enough, enough. Stop," pleaded 
Dominic, his arms up in defense.

1099
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:12,720
Eddie stopped. He loosened his grip again and 
waited for a reaction from Dominic, but none came.  

1100
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,200
Eddie stood back and watched Dominic try 
to stand up against the rail. Dominic was  

1101
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:26,320
holding his stomach and breathing heavily. He 
coughed a couple of times. His head was down.

1102
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:30,800
Eddie was out of breath himself. He hadn't 
been in a fight since he was fifteen.  

1103
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,800
It felt just the same even as an adult - tiring,  

1104
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,640
frightening and sore. That time there was a 
crowd watching. This time there was no one.

1105
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:48,720
"Don't come near me or speak to 
me again... ever. Do you hear me?"

1106
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:56,480
Dominic was still trying to get his breath. Either 
he could not speak or he did not want to. But he  

1107
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:02,320
said nothing. Eddie took one last look at him 
and backed away until he was at a safe distance.  

1108
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,680
Then he left the deck and went back inside.

1109
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,720
That was the last time anyone 
ever saw Dominic Stephens.
 
 
 

1110
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,200
CHAPTER TEN

1111
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,040
Sinking not swimming

1112
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,840
For a few days after his dismissal from 
Fenton's, Eddie actually felt quite excited.  

1113
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,000
He was relieved. A great weight 
had been lifted from his shoulders.  

1114
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:32,240
But this feeling did not last long, and he soon 
started to feel irritable and, later on, angry.

1115
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:39,600
For weeks he couldn't get Fenton's and Neal 
and Dominic out of his mind. He thought over  

1116
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,200
and over again about the injustice of it all. He 
thought about all the arguments and frustrations.  

1117
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:51,680
All the work he had done. All the work he could 
have done. Wasted. He missed his colleagues and  

1118
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,920
a sense of belonging, and he missed going to 
Russia and working with Dima and the team.

1119
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,720
To cheer himself up, he tried to remind himself 
that, apart from people like Dominic, there were  

1120
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:09,280
things he would not miss, like emails. On the 
day Eddie left Fenton's for the last time, there  

1121
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:15,520
were over four hundred unanswered emails in his 
inbox. Eddie always tried to get back to people,  

1122
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,760
but it had become impossible. Every time he got 
rid of one email, a dozen more would appear within  

1123
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:28,240
half an hour. The world had gone mad, he thought. 
At first, like everyone else, Eddie had welcomed  

1124
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:34,880
the new form of communication. It was neat, cheap, 
fast and flexible. But soon it dragged him down.  

1125
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:40,960
He didn't like to admit it, but Dominic was right 
about not reading emails. They were never-ending.

1126
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,580
Dominic.

1127
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,320
Back in his mind again.

1128
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,240
Many times he had terrible thoughts about 
what he would like to do to Dominic,  

1129
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,480
and to Neal for that matter. He thought 
of storming into the office and using  

1130
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,320
Dominic's own golf clubs to smash 
up computers and break windows,  

1131
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:04,720
and then going into the car park and doing his 
worst on Dominic's Mercedes. The shiny paintwork,  

1132
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,200
the windows - all slashed, scratched and broken. 
It felt good but his conscience would not let him.

1133
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,840
In the end, he followed Lynn's advice, which was 
to get out of the house more and go for walks,  

1134
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:24,560
or go swimming. Keep busy. Get some exercise. They 
lived two miles from their local sports center,  

1135
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,280
so every morning Eddie got up with Lynn and then 
walked through the park to the pool at the sports  

1136
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,480
center. He made this his morning routine, but he 
couldn't get used to being in a swimming pool on  

1137
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:40,720
a weekday morning at 10 a.m. He normally swam 
after work, so it was strange for him to find  

1138
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,920
the pool almost empty, except for some elderly 
swimmers and sometimes small school groups.  

1139
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,880
As he sat in the cafe afterwards, drinking a 
coffee or two, he always felt better. He wanted to  

1140
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:58,240
stay there all day and hide. Then his heart would 
sink at the thought of heading home to nothing.

1141
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:05,440
In fairness, Eddie had started looking for jobs in 
the same week that he was fired. But as depression  

1142
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:13,680
set in, he lost interest and motivation. Then, 
to his alarm, he lost confidence. In a way,  

1143
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,400
this was worse than the depression, but these 
were all new feelings and he was overwhelmed.  

1144
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,400
Everything he had done seemed meaningless, and he 
wondered how he would ever do a serious job again.

1145
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,120
He and Lynn had enough money saved 
to last for about four months,  

1146
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:34,320
but the time soon passed and there were 
no vacancies. His chances with the best  

1147
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,360
companies in his sector were also harmed by the 
news of his dismissal over the budget fiasco.

1148
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,800
By the time there were a couple of 
opportunities, Eddie was physically unwell  

1149
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,560
and his doctor had agreed he was not fit for work. 
It took time for sickness benefits to be paid,  

1150
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:57,840
and with the two of them living on Lynn's small 
teaching salary the financial pressures grew.  

1151
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:05,040
Bills turned into reminders. Reminders turned 
into final reminders. And final reminders became  

1152
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,400
phone calls from angry gas and electricity 
companies, TV companies and insurance companies.  

1153
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:18,000
Then finally the bank called. Eddie was having a 
bad day anyway. This was the last thing he needed.

1154
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:26,720
"Hello, Mr Munro, this is CNTS bank. May I ask you 
some security questions?" said a young male voice.

1155
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,880
"Not really," said Eddie. He 
almost hung up straight away.

1156
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,560
"I just want to ask you some security questions  

1157
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,680
and then talk to you about your 
account," the voice insisted.

1158
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:43,200
"Well, how do I know you're the bank? You could 
be anyone," said Eddie. He had decided to stay  

1159
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,640
on the phone, but he wasn't going to make 
it easy for the person at the other end.

1160
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,320
"I can assure you this is the CNTS bank calling."

1161
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,520
"OK, then, well I can assure you that 
this is Mr Munro. What do you want?"

1162
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,000
"I can't do that, Mr Munro. I need 
to ask some security questions."

1163
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,560
"Well, my bank told me not to 
give my security questions away."

1164
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,480
"Mr Munro..."

1165
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:12,720
"Ah, you don't know I am Mr Munro yet, do 
you?" said Eddie. "When is your date of birth?"

1166
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,840
"I'm not telling you that until 
you prove you are the bank."

1167
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,000
"All right, sir, ask me a 
question about your account."

1168
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,480
"OK, how much money is in my account?"

1169
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:29,840
"I can't tell you that. I have to ask you 
some security questions first." Eddie hung up.

1170
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,200
Thirty seconds later the phone rang 
again. Eddie considered ignoring it,  

1171
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:39,680
but he was bored and was enjoying 
being in control for once. "Hello?"

1172
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,240
"Good morning, Mr Munro. This is CNTS bank..."

1173
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,280
"Hi, how are you?"

1174
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,880
The voice didn't know what to say for a moment,  

1175
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,480
but then sprang back into action. 
"I'm fine, thank you, sir."

1176
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,720
Eddie had to admit that the young man was 
professional. If he was annoyed, he was hiding  

1177
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:06,160
it well. Eddie felt a little guilty - the man was 
only doing his job. Then he thought of Dominic and  

1178
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:12,000
Neal and what bosses like them would do to such 
youthful enthusiasm. He realized that the voice  

1179
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,920
was still speaking, but Eddie wasn't paying 
attention. "Sorry? I wasn't listening," he said.

1180
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:22,960
"That's OK, sir. I was just saying that 
we need to talk to you about your account,  

1181
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,920
and I can get my supervisor if you wish."

1182
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,800
Eddie decided to give some 
ground. This was getting boring.

1183
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,800
"Go on, I believe you. You're 
CNTS bank. What do you want?"

1184
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,720
"Thank you, Mr Munro. I just need to ask 
you some security questions. Is that OK?"

1185
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,020
"Fine."

1186
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,840
"Thank you. Can you confirm your 
telephone banking password?"

1187
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,280
"Chinatown."

1188
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:50,400
"Thank you. And can you give me the second 
and last numbers in your security code?"

1189
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,160
"Eight and three."

1190
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,000
"Thank you, Mr Munro."

1191
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,440
"You're welcome."

1192
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,800
"That completes the security with you."

1193
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,920
"I'm so pleased."

1194
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:05,200
"I was calling because your account had 
insufficient funds to pay some direct  

1195
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,480
debits this month, and your credit card with us 
is now stopped until you make further payments."

1196
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,000
"Great. Thank you for telling me. Goodbye."

1197
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:22,400
"No, Mr Munro. You are currently overdrawn by 
3,478.11 pounds, and the balance on your credit  

1198
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:31,520
card is 4,490.30 pounds I have to ask if and when 
you will be making payments into your account."

1199
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,560
"I have no idea. I've lost my job and I can't 
work. I'm thinking of doing the lottery on  

1200
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,320
Saturday, so give me a call on Monday and 
I'll tell you if I can pay you or not.  

1201
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,080
If it helps, I'll enter my bank 
account number and see if it wins."

1202
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,360
"Mr Munro, my supervisor is here. He would like 
to have a word with you. Would that be OK?"

1203
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,480
"Not really." Eddie hung up.

1204
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,520
This time the phone did not ring 
again, which surprised Eddie in a way.  

1205
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:03,280
He walked slowly into the kitchen, made a coffee,  

1206
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:08,800
picked up the newspaper and sat in an armchair to 
flick through the pages to see what was on TV.
 
 
 

1207
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:10,960
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1208
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,320
After the fight

1209
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:19,120
Eddie went back inside the ship and made his way 
to the toilets, where he locked himself inside a  

1210
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,680
cubicle. He was shaking and sweating. He sat 
down and put out his hands in front of him,  

1211
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:32,080
watching the shaking in fascination and fear. He 
could feel the pain in his chest now, and his ear  

1212
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:37,360
was sore. He wiped his face with the palm 
of his hand; there was blood coming from  

1213
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,560
his nose. He used some toilet paper to 
stop the bleeding. He felt exhausted.

1214
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,800
Eddie stayed where he was for about ten 
minutes. The toilets were empty and no  

1215
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:54,560
one else came in during that time. He almost 
expected Dominic to come in, and he imagined  

1216
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,400
the fight starting all over again. A struggle 
by the sinks, mirrors breaking, doors slamming.

1217
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,960
He decided to make his way back to the dining 
room. He came out of the cubicle and looked in  

1218
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:13,840
the mirror to straighten his clothes and his hair. 
The bleeding had stopped. He washed his face.

1219
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,600
The dance floor was full and the 
dining area was being cleared.  

1220
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,920
Lynn was at the table talking to some 
other guests when Eddie found her.

1221
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,160
"Hello, stranger," she said. "You 
took your time. Where's Dominic?"

1222
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:32,560
Eddie wasn't ready for a conversation about 
this right now. "I couldn't find him."

1223
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,800
"So where've you been all this time?"

1224
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,680
"I went to get some fresh air,  

1225
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:41,920
then I went over to the Starlight Lounge 
and checked some emails on the internet."

1226
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,480
"Eddie, you're on holiday!" she 
said, putting her arm around him.

1227
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,680
"I know. Sorry."

1228
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,080
"Come on, what do you want to drink?"

1229
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,960
"I'll have a large scotch. No ice."

1230
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,500
"Really?"

1231
01:35:55,280 --> 01:36:01,680
"Well, why not? We're on holiday." Eddie tried 
to smile. His ear and nose were stinging.  

1232
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:04,640
His chest ached. Maybe he had a broken rib?

1233
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:11,040
"OK. Wait here. I'll get them," she said, and 
Eddie turned to watch the dancing and the band.  

1234
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:18,640
He was calmer now. The shock felt less. He glanced 
over at the band and saw Jen looking at him,  

1235
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:24,400
and she gave a small wave. He waved back, 
but suddenly wondered if she was in fact  

1236
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,040
waving to Dominic somehow. He looked 
behind him, but Dominic wasn't there.

1237
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,320
When Lynn came back, they had their drinks and 
danced for a while. Eddie was tense the whole  

1238
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:41,280
time, waiting for Dominic to launch a sudden 
attack on the table. Or maybe he had gone  

1239
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:46,240
back to his cabin to rest and would wait until 
tomorrow or the next day to continue the fight.

1240
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:50,400
"I wonder where Dominic is?" said Lynn.

1241
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:54,720
"No idea," said Eddie. "Come 
on. I'm tired. Let's go to bed."

1242
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,600
Even as they reached the cabin, Eddie was looking 
around for Dominic, but he knew now that he must  

1243
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:07,360
have gone to his own cabin. He felt relieved as 
they walked in, and he sat down on the couch.

1244
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,320
Lynn was looking in the mirror, 
taking off her necklace and earrings.  

1245
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,600
In the mirror she watched Eddie 
sitting down. "You OK?" she asked.

1246
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,160
"Not really."

1247
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,280
"What happened to your face?"

1248
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:26,320
Eddie laughed briefly. He suddenly 
saw the absurdity of it all.  

1249
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:32,320
"I had a fight with Dominic," he said, 
looking at the bruises on his hands.

1250
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,640
"You mean you had an argument?"

1251
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:42,000
"No, I mean I had a fight. A proper fight. You 
know, where people hit each other a few times."  

1252
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,000
He was trying to laugh again. But the tears in 
his eyes and on his cheeks were not happy ones.  

1253
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,320
Lynn stopped what she was doing 
and came to sit beside Eddie.

1254
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:53,920
"You're shaking."

1255
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,140
"Yeah."

1256
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,680
"What happened?" she asked.

1257
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,520
"To be honest, I can't really 
remember. It all happened so fast.  

1258
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:08,480
We were outside on deck one minute, and 
the next I was trying to strangle him."  

1259
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,520
Eddie made a strangling gesture with his 
hands, and again he saw that they were shaking.

1260
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,000
"What?"

1261
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,800
"I know. I can't really believe it myself.  

1262
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,760
At one point I think he was going to pass 
out. I almost pushed him over the side."

1263
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,060
"Eddie!"

1264
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,040
He was shaking his head.

1265
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,200
"Was anyone watching all this? 
You must have looked like madmen."

1266
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,160
"No. It was just us. By the lifeboats."

1267
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,120
"Where is he now?" asked Lynn.

1268
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:44,240
"I don't know. I thought he followed me back 
inside, but he must have gone back to his cabin."

1269
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,920
Lynn got Eddie a glass of water.

1270
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,360
"Thanks," he said. "Sorry."

1271
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:56,080
"I can't believe this. You're like a pair of 
kids. It's one thing to find him on board,  

1272
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,040
but it's another to start fighting 
like kids in a playground."

1273
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,920
"He started it," said Eddie.

1274
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,360
"Listen to yourself, Ed!"

1275
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:04,660
"I know."

1276
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:11,040
"Look, it's a shock that he's on the same cruise, 
I admit, and I know it brings it all back.  

1277
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,400
But I thought the plan was to keep a low 
profile now. Ignore him. Forget him."

1278
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,840
"How can we forget him when 
he's on the same cruise ship?"

1279
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,840
"Well, we'll have to manage, and I 
suggest we wait and see what happens.  

1280
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:32,320
If he approaches you at breakfast or something, 
don't get involved. Apologise and walk away."

1281
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,360
"Apologise?!"

1282
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:39,840
"OK, well, maybe not apologise. 
Just ignore him. Promise?"

1283
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,880
"Yes, I promise," said Eddie.
 
 
 

1284
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,120
CHAPTER TWELVE

1285
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,120
Lynn and Eddie argue

1286
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,720
Six months had passed since Eddie's departure 
from Fenton's, and no work offers were coming  

1287
01:39:54,720 --> 01:40:02,320
in. Summer was over and the evenings were getting 
darker. Eddie had lost weight and his relationship  

1288
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:08,320
with Lynn was in a bad way. Either they argued 
over most things or they didn't speak at all.

1289
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:15,760
One Thursday afternoon Lynn came in from work 
and Eddie was sitting in his armchair as usual,  

1290
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:22,080
watching a TV show from America. A couple 
and their neighbours were arguing over a dog.  

1291
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,200
Lynn was soaking wet. The rain was heavy outside.

1292
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:33,520
"These people are so stupid," he said, not looking 
up. "This guy says he can't sleep because of his  

1293
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,320
neighbours dog, and the neighbour says the other 
guy's been shooting at it with an air rifle!"

1294
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:43,200
"It's OK. I'm fine, thanks. 
Don't get up," Lynn said,  

1295
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,160
putting down heavy shopping bags 
as she came through the front door.

1296
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,360
"So this guy..." Eddie continued, 
"... the guy with the dog,  

1297
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,720
is suing the other guy for a hundred 
thousand dollars in damages!"

1298
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,840
Lynn was neither interested nor 
amused. She took off her coat,  

1299
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:05,360
picked up the bags and went into the kitchen. 
On the way, she threw the post on to the sofa.

1300
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:11,360
"But the other guy - the guy with 
the gun - he's suing the dog owner  

1301
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:15,120
because he says the dog barks all 
night and messes up his garden."

1302
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,840
Eddie knew he had already upset 
Lynn, but he stayed where he was.  

1303
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,840
She was always upset these days. He decided 
to shout out the rest of his commentary  

1304
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,520
so that Lynn could hear him in the kitchen.

1305
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:34,080
"And now their wives are complaining that the 
men are obsessed with arguing with each other.  

1306
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:38,480
They've been fighting over the dog for three 
years, and now they both want a divorce."

1307
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,920
Eddie heard Lynn say something from the kitchen.

1308
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,320
"What?" he shouted.

1309
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:45,840
"Nothing."

1310
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,600
"No, go on," he shouted. "What did you say?"

1311
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:54,800
"Nothing. Go back to your 
show. It sounds fascinating,"  

1312
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,840
she said. Eddie got up and went 
to see her. "What's wrong?"

1313
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:04,960
Lynn ignored him and started putting 
shopping away in cupboards and in the fridge.

1314
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,800
"What's wrong?" he asked again.

1315
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:17,200
This time she stopped and looked at Eddie. "Erm, 
well, let me see. I get up in the morning and go  

1316
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,480
to work while you sit and watch telly. I come in 
from work, and you're still sitting and watching  

1317
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:28,640
telly. I do the shopping, I get no help. I do the 
cooking, I get no help. I try to talk to you, and  

1318
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,440
I get nothing. You used to have breakfast with me 
in the mornings, and now you don't get up at all!  

1319
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,640
We never go out. Our friends don't call 
us. The house is a mess, and you're here  

1320
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:44,400
all day making it messier. You don't clean 
up, you don't tidy. You look a mess..."

1321
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,200
"Thanks very much."

1322
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:51,440
"... and I don't hear anything positive from 
you about anything. Anything! I'm sick of it."

1323
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,080
There was a pause after she stopped.

1324
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,080
"Bad day then?" he said.

1325
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:04,880
"It's not funny, Eddie. I worry so much about 
you, your job situation, money - and then I go  

1326
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:09,760
into work and I have at least twenty - five 
kids in my class all day. I try to keep them  

1327
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:16,160
under control and happy, but I just want to cry. 
I want to tell them all to shut up. I want to  

1328
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:21,840
tell them to enjoy drawing pictures and singing 
songs, because after that life is pointless."

1329
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,560
"So, you did have a bad day."

1330
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:28,560
"Bad year, Eddie. Bad year."

1331
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,640
"So it's all my fault?"

1332
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,360
"That is not what I mean."

1333
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,200
"Yeah, right."

1334
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:42,800
At that point, Lynn picked up a full box of eggs 
and threw it at Eddie. He ducked just in time,  

1335
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,040
and the whole thing exploded on the kitchen wall.

1336
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:51,840
"I guess we can have omelets for dinner," said 
Eddie, but he knew things had gone too far.

1337
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,600
"You can have omelets for dinner. I'm going out."

1338
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,300
"Where to?"

1339
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,520
"I'm going to Angela's."

1340
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,840
"Angela's? That's two hours 
away. When will you be back?"

1341
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,840
"Saturday."

1342
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:07,280
"Saturday?"

1343
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,840
"Maybe Sunday. I don't know."

1344
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,320
"Lynn, please."

1345
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:18,560
"No, Eddie. I've had enough. We're broke - 
worse than broke - we are in so much debt.  

1346
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:23,440
You've got no job and you can't get a 
job, or you don't want one. I don't know."

1347
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,040
"Lynn, listen to me."

1348
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,240
"You sit in the house all day, 
feeling sorry for yourself..."

1349
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:28,740
"Lynn..."

1350
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,080
She was crying now.

1351
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,600
"... and it isn't getting better," she 
sobbed. "It's getting worse and I hate it.  

1352
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:41,360
I'm sorry you lost your job, and I'm sorry it 
made you ill. I'm sorry I'm not strong enough now,  

1353
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:49,280
but I can't help you anymore. I tried. I've 
lost you. You're here, but you're not here.  

1354
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,080
I want a break. We want a break."

1355
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,240
"No, Lynn. Please, we have to talk..."

1356
01:44:58,240 --> 01:44:59,840
"I'll call you when I get to Angela's."

1357
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:05,120
She was walking out of the kitchen and 
into the hall. She opened the door under  

1358
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,920
the stairs and took out an overnight bag. 
Eddie could see she had already packed it.

1359
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,760
"I don't believe this. You're leaving me?"

1360
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,800
"No. I'll be back on Sunday. Maybe. I don't know."

1361
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,040
"This is ridiculous. You can't go. Lynn, 
we've been together for ten years."

1362
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:27,840
She was putting on her coat.

1363
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,320
"What about your job?"

1364
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:35,360
"I don't care about the job. You don't care 
about work. Now I don't care about work."

1365
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:40,720
She was walking down the hall towards 
the front door. Eddie grabbed her arm.

1366
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:41,920
"Get your hands off me."

1367
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:42,980
"Lynn."

1368
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,800
"Get your hands off me!"

1369
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,240
He let go.

1370
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:48,880
"Lynn, I'm sorry."

1371
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,320
But she had walked out of the door and got 
into her car, and was driving down the road.

1372
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,400
Eddie stood in the doorway 
and watched the car disappear.  

1373
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,120
The rain had stopped, but the 
clouds were ready for another storm.  

1374
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:10,480
He went back inside and the house felt very 
strange. Panic was in his mind, heart and stomach.  

1375
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,400
The kitchen door was open, and he saw broken 
eggs dripping off the clock and down the wall.

1376
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,680
He sat down on the sofa. The neighbours 
were still arguing about the dog,  

1377
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:25,840
which was now in the studio, and a dog 
psychologist was trying to talk to it.  

1378
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:31,920
This time last year he was in Moscow working 
on the project of his career with good money  

1379
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:38,080
in the bank, and he and Lynn had even discussed 
starting a family. Now, he had lost his job,  

1380
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:44,400
his money, his health, his confidence, and 
even his wife. Instead of taking the company  

1381
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:49,920
to the next level and building a future, he was 
sitting in his lounge watching a dog in therapy.

1382
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,840
He looked around for the remote control 
to change channels, and saw the post.  

1383
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,000
There were some letters for Lynn, 
the new programme for the theatre,  

1384
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,520
more bills, and a letter from 
Steve Scott, his solicitor.  

1385
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:10,400
He knew what the letter said before he opened it. 
It was the result of many difficult meetings with  

1386
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:16,000
his solicitor and financial adviser. The 
letter now confirmed that he was bankrupt.

1387
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,160
Bankrupt.

1388
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:19,600
A death.

1389
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,240
The end of a life with money.

1390
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:29,280
For a few more minutes Eddie watched two American 
adults fighting and a dog being hypnotized.  

1391
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,920
Then he put the letter back in its 
envelope and went into the kitchen  

1392
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,840
to clean the eggs off his kitchen wall.
 
 
 

1393
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,560
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1394
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,120
The search

1395
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:45,440
The next morning Eddie and Lynn walked 
into the dining room and saw Jen having  

1396
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:51,120
breakfast with some members of the band. Two 
men in uniform were also sitting at the table.  

1397
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,880
They were asking questions and taking notes. 
Eddie assumed it was a discussion about the  

1398
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:02,080
coming evening's performance. He was relieved 
to see that Dominic was nowhere to be seen.  

1399
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,320
He still didn't feel ready for the 
inevitable second confrontation.

1400
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,160
"She looks upset," said Lynn as they sat 
eating their breakfast at a table nearby.

1401
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
"Maybe Dominic went back last 
night and started another fight."

1402
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:18,800
"Where is he then?"

1403
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,200
"Maybe she strangled him?"

1404
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:21,700
"Eddie!"

1405
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:26,800
"Sorry. He's having a lie-in, I 
suppose. Who knows? Who cares?"

1406
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,920
At this point Jen looked 
across and saw Eddie and Lynn.  

1407
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:37,280
She pointed at them and got up to come over. 
The two men in uniform accompanied her.

1408
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,040
"Hello, Jen," said Lynn. "Is something wrong?"

1409
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:47,040
"It's Dominic. He's missing. He never 
came back last night. Have you seen him?"

1410
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:51,040
Eddie went cold. Lynn looked at him.

1411
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,200
"Not this morning, no," said Eddie. Lynn 
shook her head to say the same thing.

1412
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,520
"Did you see him last night 
at all?" said one of the men.

1413
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:08,560
"Yes, I did," said Eddie. "I went out for 
some fresh air, and Dominic was outside. We  

1414
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,840
chatted for a bit and then I came in. Dominic 
stayed outside. I didn't see him after that."

1415
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,360
Eddie could honestly say that this was the truth.  

1416
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,040
He decided not to mention the part 
about trying to kill each other.

1417
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,480
"When was this?" asked the other man.

1418
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,320
"Oh, about midnight, I think. Or just after."

1419
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,160
"What did you talk about?"

1420
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,680
"Not much really. The cruise, the 
weather, the food - that kind of thing."  

1421
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,600
Eddie decided he needed to tell them more. 
Just in case people became suspicious.  

1422
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:46,800
Get his story out first. "I remembered him 
from a long time ago, though," he said.

1423
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,280
"What do you mean?" asked the second 
man, looking up from his notes.

1424
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:57,440
"Mr Stephens used to work at the same 
company as me years ago - at Fenton's - a  

1425
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:02,960
software manufacturer in the UK. He was the 
divisional boss for a while. I was in sales.  

1426
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,760
When Lynn and I first saw him yesterday, 
we weren't sure if it was him or not.  

1427
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:12,800
I wasn't feeling well anyway, so we thought 
we'd meet him later and find out then."

1428
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:16,240
"And was it him? You knew him from work?"

1429
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:17,540
"Yes."

1430
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,880
"And did you talk to him about 
it when you saw him later?"

1431
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:27,680
"He didn't really remember me, and it was almost 
twenty years ago. I don't blame him. Anyway,  

1432
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:31,760
we're both here to get away from work, so I 
guess that's why we didn't really talk about it.  

1433
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,080
I wasn't outside with him for that long."

1434
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,840
"Did he seem upset or stressed in any way?"

1435
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:45,520
Eddie suddenly recalled Dominic's face again. He 
had looked very upset and considerably stressed  

1436
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,440
when Eddie had his hands around 
his neck. "Not particularly."

1437
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,280
"What about you, ma'am?" asked the first man.

1438
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,440
"I only met him on the cruise 
for the first time yesterday.  

1439
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:01,840
Jen introduced us when we all met by chance 
at the hotel around lunchtime yesterday."

1440
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,000
"And how did he seem to you?"

1441
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:10,560
"Normal, I suppose. Eddie wasn't feeling well, 
so we came back. I didn't see him after that."

1442
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,160
The Parvina returned to Barbados, where the 
cruise was delayed and an official search began.  

1443
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:21,440
Eddie saw helicopters come and go,  

1444
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:25,360
and he saw police coming and going at 
the harbour. There was even a TV crew.

1445
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:32,400
The atmosphere on board had not changed very much. 
The ship was so big and there were so many people,  

1446
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:37,840
with so many things going on, that Dominic's 
disappearance seemed only a minor problem. It  

1447
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:41,200
was almost like an additional activity 
for the passengers to talk about.  

1448
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,120
Who was the man? When did he disappear? Why?  

1449
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:49,440
What happened? Was he injured on the 
ship somewhere? Did he fall overboard?

1450
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:55,600
Eddie and Lynn walked into town to get 
away from things. They walked for hours  

1451
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:00,080
around the streets and marinas. Here and 
there they stopped and looked at their map,  

1452
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,640
and read their guidebook about 
the history of Bridgetown.  

1453
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,440
They tried not to talk about Dominic, or even 
to think about it. But Eddie could see that  

1454
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:15,840
Lynn was worried, and Lynn could see the same in 
Eddie. Sooner or later they had to talk again.  

1455
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:21,200
So they had lunch in a cafe overlooking a 
small bay, and Lynn was the first to speak.

1456
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,680
"What do you think has happened, Ed?"

1457
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,960
"I've no idea. I left him 
standing by the rail. He was OK.  

1458
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:36,240
After the fight, he was obviously tired and so 
was I. To be honest, I think we were both a bit  

1459
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:43,520
shocked and embarrassed - and bruised. But he was 
all right when I left him. Actually, I thought he  

1460
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:48,560
would come after me. I was in the toilet for about 
ten minutes. Then I came back in to find you."

1461
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,080
"Do you think he fell overboard?" she asked.

1462
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,680
"Not from where we were. There was another 
deck below, and the rail was too high.  

1463
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:59,520
To go overboard he'd need to jump."

1464
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,840
"So, do you think he jumped?"

1465
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,400
"The man thinks he's better than 
anyone else. Why would he do that?"

1466
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,160
"Who knows? Sixteen years is 
a long time. People change."

1467
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:16,400
"Yeah, well, people like him 
don't change. Unfortunately."

1468
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,440
When they returned to the ship, the police 
asked him to go to the office in Bridgetown  

1469
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:28,880
to give an official statement. Jen had made her 
statement and given all the information she could.  

1470
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,840
When she mentioned meeting Lynn and Eddie, 
it did not take them long to follow it up.

1471
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:40,560
"And you met at the hotel, is that right?" 
asked a tall policeman sitting at his PC.

1472
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,180
"Yes."

1473
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,680
"Were you friends?"

1474
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:48,880
"No, but I worked with him many 
years ago. We never stayed in touch.  

1475
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,240
We were only colleagues, and I never 
knew much about him or his life.  

1476
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,440
I couldn't believe it when I saw him again 
after so long. He didn't even recognise me."

1477
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,640
"So did you meet later, back on the boat?"

1478
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,640
"Not together, no. As I said, his 
girlfriend met my wife by chance.  

1479
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:12,240
We met briefly at lunch, and we agreed 
to meet later for a drink." Eddie didn't  

1480
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:16,560
mean to say that, but then he realized Jen 
had probably said that in her statement.

1481
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:22,320
Eddie waited for another question. 
The policeman looked up at him.  

1482
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:26,400
"How did he seem when you met 
him at the hotel? Happy? Sad?"

1483
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:34,080
"It was hard to tell," said Eddie. That was 
true. "He had his sunglasses on the whole time.  

1484
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,320
We only chatted for a few minutes."

1485
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:37,520
"And did you meet for a drink?"

1486
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,040
"No, we didn't. We were supposed to meet 
at the bar after Jen, his girlfriend,  

1487
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:46,800
finished her session with the band. 
I met him briefly on deck though."

1488
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:53,680
"I see," said the policeman, tapping information 
on his keyboard. "What did you talk about?"

1489
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,760
"Not much really. I was only with him for 
about five minutes, but I came inside because  

1490
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:05,760
I was cold." Then Eddie thought he should 
add something else. "I was hoping to find  

1491
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,600
out what he'd been up to since the old 
days, but I never saw him after that."

1492
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,200
"Why not?"

1493
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,760
"I'm not sure, to be honest. I 
was with my wife for the evening,  

1494
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,400
but we went back to our cabin 
earlier than we had planned.  

1495
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:24,560
We were tired. I was feeling unwell. I was 
unwell at the hotel. Too much sun, I think."

1496
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:31,920
"Ah yes, Mr Stephens' girlfriend mentioned 
that. What time did you go to your cabin?"

1497
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:37,760
"I have no idea." Eddie didn't like to end 
his statement with uncertainty, so he added:  

1498
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:43,600
"On the ship you lose track of time. We both 
went to sleep. The first thing we heard about  

1499
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:47,920
Dominic's disappearance was this morning 
when Jen came to tell us at breakfast."

1500
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,000
The policeman nodded and carried on typing.

1501
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,400
"So what do you think has happened?" 
Eddie asked the policeman.  

1502
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:01,360
"We're not allowed to say, Mr Munro. 
A thorough search of the ship and  

1503
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:06,080
the area is being carried out. If we hear 
anything, there will be an announcement."

1504
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,360
"Is that all then?" asked Eddie.

1505
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:15,280
"Yes, thank you, that's all for now. We have 
your details if we have any more questions."

1506
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:22,800
"OK," said Eddie. He got up and walked out of 
the office into the bright Caribbean sunshine.
 
 
 

1507
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,400
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1508
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,840
Swimming not sinking

1509
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:34,400
In the end, Lynn stayed with Angela for five 
months. She told Eddie that she needed some time  

1510
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:40,240
to feel normal again. They didn't argue anymore 
and it was only a separation, but it frightened  

1511
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:46,320
Eddie. When Lynn left and stayed away for five 
months instead of three nights, he really thought  

1512
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:52,880
he'd lost her forever. He was as low, lost and 
lonely as anyone can feel, but he knew this was  

1513
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:59,600
a turning point. Losing Lynn was a thousand times 
worse than losing his job, and he needed to make  

1514
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:06,160
changes. As Clive said to him during that time: 
"When you hit rock bottom, the only way is up."

1515
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:13,520
It was a mess, however. Eddie's mental health was 
not good, and it got much worse when Lynn left.  

1516
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:21,600
He couldn't find work, and his depression made it 
impossible to do so. Lynn also lost her job when  

1517
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:27,360
she didn't come back immediately. They had to sell 
the house and furniture to cover all their debts,  

1518
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:30,400
and they were no longer in a position 
to borrow money to start again.

1519
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:37,360
Steve Scott, their solicitor, was an enormous 
help to both of them, handling their finances  

1520
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:42,880
and their legal problems. He did everything 
except start a divorce action for them,  

1521
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:49,120
and they had Clive to thank for that. Clive 
realized that the separation could not last long,  

1522
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:53,520
and he kept in touch with both of them to make 
sure that it didn't result in total breakdown.

1523
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:59,600
By Christmas that year Eddie was staying at 
Clive's and Lynn was I still at Angela's.  

1524
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,840
On New Year's Day Eddie called 
Lynn to give her his best wishes.

1525
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,640
"Happy New Year," he said.

1526
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,760
"Same to you. All the best," she said.

1527
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,480
"I hope it's better than the last one," he said.

1528
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,960
"That won't be difficult. It 
couldn't be worse," she said.

1529
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:20,160
Silence.

1530
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,480
"It's strange," said Eddie. "We have 
never been apart on New Year's Eve."

1531
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,400
"No," said Lynn.

1532
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:28,080
"What did you do?"

1533
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:35,680
"Well, you know me. I don't like it much. Angela 
and I stayed in on our own and watched DVDs.  

1534
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,560
Then some neighbours came around just before 
midnight. We got to bed around two o'clock."

1535
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,000
"Sounds good."

1536
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:43,200
"Not really."

1537
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:44,500
"Why?"

1538
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:48,240
"Well, you know..." she said.

1539
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:51,040
Eddie knew. "Yes," he said.

1540
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,840
"You?" asked Lynn.

1541
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:54,900
"What?"

1542
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,000
"What did you do?"

1543
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,760
"Oh, Clive and I went to the pub and 
stayed there until about one. It was OK."

1544
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,520
"How is Clive?"

1545
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,160
"He's here. Do you want to speak to him?"

1546
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,160
"No, it's all right. I'll text him."

1547
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:09,460
"OK."

1548
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:10,880
A pause.

1549
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:14,400
"Lynn?" said Eddie eventually.

1550
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:15,840
"I'm still here."

1551
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,280
"I miss you."

1552
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:18,580
"I know."

1553
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,640
"Come back. Please."

1554
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,000
"I can't."

1555
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:23,780
"Why?"

1556
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,840
"Because... you haven't got 
a house, and neither have I!"

1557
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,840
They both laughed a little.

1558
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,480
"OK. If I get a house, will you come back?"

1559
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,400
"Only if you get a big one."

1560
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,540
"OK."

1561
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,800
"Very big."

1562
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,300
"OK."

1563
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,880
"With a garden."

1564
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:39,520
"Right."

1565
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,800
"A big garden."

1566
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,080
"I'l1 try."

1567
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,320
"And a swimming pool."

1568
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,360
"Erm, OK."

1569
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:46,580
"Liar."

1570
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,240
"OK, the swimming pool will 
take time. I'll work on that."

1571
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:55,120
"Fine. A large bathroom and modern 
kitchen will be OK instead."

1572
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,560
"With or without egg on the walls?"

1573
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,520
He heard her laugh on the other end.

1574
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,040
Another pause.

1575
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,880
"How are you feeling?" she asked. "Generally."

1576
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,840
"Not bad. Clive makes me go swimming 
and read his car magazines."

1577
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,120
"Good for you."

1578
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,680
"Hmm," muttered Eddie.

1579
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:16,900
Silence.

1580
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,080
Eddie wanted to tell Lynn 
again that he missed her.

1581
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,560
"Don't give up, Ed," she said.

1582
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,320
"I know," he said.

1583
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:32,560
Lynn was Eddie's motivation to rebuild his life, 
and Clive was his support. But Eddie realized  

1584
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:38,480
that only he could turn things around. He was 
encouraged that over the time he was out of work,  

1585
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:44,720
he had actually started missing his work and his 
friends in the business. Over the next few years,  

1586
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:49,040
Eddie put together a business plan and 
borrowed money from friends and family.

1587
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:57,040
He began as an export agent in London for various 
UK software companies. He still had a strong and  

1588
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:02,000
loyal commercial network throughout Europe, 
and many of his old customers and contacts  

1589
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:07,120
were glad to have him back. Some had already 
become disillusioned with the larger companies  

1590
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:13,120
like Fenton's, and Eddie's introduction of new 
products and a faster and more personal service  

1591
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:19,360
brought good results. His enthusiasm and 
energy returned, and every day he enjoyed the  

1592
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,800
thought that he was his own boss; no one could 
undermine his plans or take away the credit.

1593
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:31,680
He set up a small office not far from Notting Hill 
and started off with a part-time office assistant.  

1594
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:38,320
At the end of the first year he had taken on 
three full-time people. By the following year  

1595
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:44,160
he had moved to larger offices and had a team 
of ten. It was the beginning of a sixteen-year  

1596
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:50,560
journey which turned Eddie from a bankrupt, broken 
individual into a confident and very wealthy man.

1597
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:55,680
Over time Eddie poached some 
of the team from Fentons,  

1598
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:58,400
including Clive, who soon joined him as a partner.  

1599
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:04,640
Clive then head hunted some of the best people 
from Fenton's production and development team.  

1600
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:11,680
With investment from some overseas partners, 
they then created a series of online titles  

1601
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:16,400
for companies to provide general training, 
systems and platforms to run their businesses.

1602
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:23,440
This was a turning point. Clive and Eddie's team 
developed a unique way of linking online training  

1603
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:28,320
with mobile phone technology, and their 
best-seller was a twelve-module course  

1604
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:35,200
called People Skills for Successful Business. They 
licensed it worldwide and won an innovation award.  

1605
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,120
At the awards night at the Savoy Hotel in London, 
Clive suggested they send a copy of the whole  

1606
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:47,040
series to Dominic and Neal, but Eddie said it 
was a waste. "They wouldn't understand," he said.  

1607
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:53,120
"Some people think they know everything anyway. 
Let them suffer." And they toasted their success.

1608
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:58,640
Business went from strength to strength, 
and Eddie travelled extensively  

1609
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:04,480
to build strategic partnerships using the training 
catalogue of integrated online-mobile training  

1610
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:11,520
(OMT). His contacts and friends in business 
were loyal and supportive. Within five years  

1611
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:17,920
they had offices in Hong Kong, San Francisco, 
New York, Sydney, Bucharest, Munich and Paris.

1612
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:23,360
On the day when he and Clive sold 
the business for 20 million pounds,  

1613
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,320
Eddie came home to Lynn, who was 
sitting in the garden reading.

1614
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,760
"It's done," he said, smiling.

1615
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:31,220
"Really?"

1616
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:36,400
"Really. We signed the agreement 
this afternoon. It's over."

1617
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:39,760
"Twenty million?" she asked.

1618
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:41,840
"Twenty million."

1619
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,120
"Oh, Eddie!" She jumped up 
and put her arms around him.  

1620
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:51,360
"I am so pleased for you. For us. You deserve it."

1621
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,240
"Thanks. Let's open the champagne."

1622
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,280
"It's in the fridge. I'll 
go and get it," she said.

1623
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,280
When she came back, Eddie 
handed her a large envelope.

1624
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,480
"What's this?" she asked excitedly.

1625
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,040
"Open it."

1626
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,320
Lynn tore open the envelope and pulled 
out a large, colourful holiday brochure.  

1627
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:12,960
"What's this?" she asked.

1628
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:15,120
"It's a holiday brochure."

1629
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:19,840
"I know it's a holiday brochure," she 
said, smiling. "Where are we going?"

1630
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,080
"We're going on a cruise."
 
 
 

1631
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:23,840
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1632
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,200
Revelations

1633
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:34,160
Two more days passed with no sign of Dominic. 
Then three days, then four, then five. Soon a  

1634
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:40,000
whole week had passed. Eventually the authorities 
decided to call off the search, and let the ship  

1635
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,440
continue on its voyage. The shipping line did 
not want to cause any further inconvenience for  

1636
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:51,680
the passengers. The longer they stayed there, the 
more bad publicity they faced from the press. From  

1637
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:59,040
their point of view the sooner things got back to 
normal, the better. Cruise life continued and the  

1638
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:05,840
Parvina took Eddie and Lynn, and its mystery, 
to St Lucia, Antigua, Martinique and Grenada.

1639
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:14,080
Back in Barbados, before flying home, Eddie and 
Lynn went shopping and stopped at a cafe. The  

1640
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:20,000
TV was on by the bar, but the sound was off. 
Eddie stared at the news and saw some familiar  

1641
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,360
pictures of the ship, the helicopter searches, 
and the same photograph of Dominic that was used  

1642
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:30,560
in all the reports of his disappearance. 
They had seen all these pictures before,  

1643
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:35,520
but this time the report seemed to continue 
with interviews with people back in the UK.

1644
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,880
Eddie could see a businessman 
talking to a TV journalist.  

1645
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:46,160
Then another. Then there were pictures of some 
buildings. They were offices where Dominic had  

1646
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:51,840
worked, but Eddie didn't recognise them. There 
were pictures of Dominic's house, and an interview  

1647
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:57,840
with an elderly couple. The caption read that 
they were Dominic's neighbours. There was no  

1648
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:02,480
time to get up and see if he could turn on the 
sound before the news moved on to another topic.

1649
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,160
"Lynn, they've just shown the report on 
Dominic again. But they're showing more  

1650
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:11,840
stuff from home and about where he worked 
- and interviews with his neighbours!"

1651
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:16,560
"Well, everyone loves a good 
mystery, I suppose," she said.

1652
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:20,480
"No, I think the story's 
changed. Something's going on."

1653
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,800
"Well, maybe you should get a 
newspaper or look on the internet."

1654
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:31,600
"Good idea," said Eddie, looking around. There 
were no papers, but there were two computer  

1655
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:36,960
screens in the corner. Eddie bought a username 
and password from the waiter and went online.  

1656
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:43,600
He keyed in the address for The Times' website, 
and there he saw a headline below the UK political  

1657
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:50,160
news that took him completely by surprise. Under 
a familiar photograph of Dominic, it read:
 
 

1658
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,960
Missing businessman stole 
thousands. Police suspect suicide.
 
 

1659
02:06:56,160 --> 02:07:00,480
Eddie couldn't believe it. He clicked on 
the headline and a new page revealed itself  

1660
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:04,960
on the screen. Underneath the headline 
there was a picture of a younger Dominic,  

1661
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:08,880
and a new article appeared. Eddie 
could not read it fast enough:
 
 

1662
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,280
The search for missing London businessman 
Dominic Stephens has finally been called off.  

1663
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:21,440
Authorities now believe that Mr Stephens took 
his own life whilst on a cruise in the Caribbean,  

1664
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,840
leaving behind large debts and 
a trail of fraud and corruption.

1665
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:31,280
Mr Stephens went missing over a week ago on 
the American cruise ship Parvina some time  

1666
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:37,520
after midnight on 20 June in the south 
Caribbean sea. After days of searching,  

1667
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:42,400
it is now believed that Mr Stephens may have 
jumped overboard somewhere between Barbados and  

1668
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:49,600
St Lucia in an act of suicide. The exact time of 
his disappearance is not known. Search and rescue  

1669
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:54,480
teams have been covering an area of thousands 
of square miles with no sign of Mr Stephens.

1670
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:00,480
The disappearance follows reports that Mr Stephens 
had recently been fired from Flash Electronics  

1671
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:06,640
Inc. by partners in the firm. It had been 
discovered that Mr Stephens had embezzled at least  

1672
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:12,800
145,000 pounds from the company during the 
seven years he had worked there as CEO.  

1673
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,200
Further interviews with police are 
also being held at other companies,  

1674
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:23,040
who have also reported acts of fraud, corruption 
and intimidation in connection with Mr Stephens.

1675
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:29,920
The sixty-one-year-old businessman was due to 
appear in court on 15 June, charged with theft,  

1676
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:35,120
but failed to make an appearance. He was 
reported missing by his wife, Margaret Stephens,  

1677
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,920
but it is believed Mr Stephens left 
the country on 16 June to join the  

1678
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:44,640
cruise ship Parvina. Friends and colleagues 
spoke of their shock and disappointment...

1679
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:50,880
Eddie looked up from the screen and turned 
around to Lynn who was sipping an iced tea.

1680
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:56,560
"Lynn, you're not going to believe this," he said.

1681
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:05,200
On the last night of the cruise Eddie and Lynn had 
a quiet dinner together in the Starlight Lounge,  

1682
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:08,560
danced for a while, and then went 
for a walk on deck before bed.

1683
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,960
Although the day's intense humidity 
had gone, the evening was still warm.  

1684
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:20,480
The sky was clear, and bright stars mixed once 
more with island lights on the far horizon.  

1685
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,600
Eddie leaned on the rail and looked out.

1686
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,320
"I'm going to miss all this," he said.

1687
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,560
"I know. Me too. But we 
can do it again, can't we?"

1688
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:31,840
"Yes. Definitely."

1689
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,400
"But maybe next time  

1690
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,360
we can do it without your ex-boss turning 
up and creating an international incident."

1691
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:46,800
Eddie smiled. "Well, if he does turn up next 
time, he'll have a lot of explaining to do."

1692
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:51,120
"Unbelievable. It's like a 
story from a film or a book."

1693
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,640
"Yes. Truth is often stranger than fiction."

1694
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,920
A pause. Both of them looked out to sea.

1695
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:02,560
"Do you really think he's out there?" asked Lynn.

1696
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,920
"He must be. He's not on 
the ship, that's for sure."

1697
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:11,680
"It's a scary thought. He 
must have been so desperate,  

1698
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:16,720
to jump off a ship at sea. If he did 
jump. Can you imagine?" said Lynn.

1699
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,240
"Maybe he fell."

1700
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:24,560
"Maybe you pushed him," she said, smiling 
and nudging Eddie in the side with her elbow.  

1701
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:29,840
It still hurt where Dominic had punched 
him. The man was still a pain in his side.

1702
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:33,360
"Maybe someone else pushed him?" suggested Eddie.  

1703
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,800
"Back home there was probably a long queue of 
people waiting to do something like that to him,  

1704
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:42,720
and to all the superior-minded, 
arrogant Dominic's of the world."

1705
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:45,040
"Sad," she said.

1706
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:51,280
"Very," said Eddie. "Some are pushed and 
some jump anyway. That's the way it is.  

1707
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:55,840
That's the way it's always been. 
The trick is what you do next."

1708
02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:01,040
Eddie took a deep, relaxed 
breath, let out a long sigh  

1709
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:06,320
and looked out to sea to the Caribbean 
horizon once more and for the last time.

1710
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,400
And then he smiled.

1711
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:10,960
It was very clear to him now.

1712
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:16,560
He could easily make out the difference 
between the stars and the lights of the island,  

1713
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:20,880
and he wondered why he had 
never noticed it before.
 
 
 
 

1714
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:21,380
- THE END -
