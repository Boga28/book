THE NIGHT TRAIN AT DEOLI
 

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,640
There are some moments in life that are never 
forgotten. It can be anything - a favourite  

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,800
toy from childhood, a time of shared laughter, 
the pain of lost love, the scent of a flower,  

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,640
sunlight on a distant mountain top, 
the platform of a small railway station  

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:43,840
in northern India, in the soft 
quiet light of early morning...

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,080
When I was at college, I used to spend my summer 
holidays at Dehra, at my grandmother's place.  

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
I stayed there in the hills from 
early May until late in July.  

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
Deoli was a small station 
about thirty miles from Dehra;  

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
it marked the beginning of the heavy 
jungles of the Indian Terai area.

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,680
The train used to reach Deoli at about five in 
the morning, when the station was poorly lit  

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,840
with oil lamps, and the jungle across the railway 
line was just visible in the early light of day.  

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,040
Deoli only had one platform, a waiting room, and 
an office for the stationmaster. On the platform  

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,720
there was a tea stall, a fruit seller, and 
a few thin, hungry dogs; not much else,  

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,160
because the train stopped there for only ten 
minutes before rushing on into the forests.

15
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Why it stopped at Deoli, I don't know. Nothing 
ever happened there. Nobody got off the train  

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,080
and nobody got on. But the train always stopped 
there a full ten minutes, and then a bell sounded,  

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,320
the guard blew his whistle, and soon 
Deoli was left behind and forgotten.

18
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,240
I used to wonder what happened in Deoli, 
behind the station walls. I always felt sorry  

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,520
for that lonely little platform, and for the 
place that nobody wanted to visit. I decided  

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,840
that one day I would get off the train at Deoli, 
and spend the day there, just to please the town.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,440
I was eighteen, visiting my grandmother, 
and the night train stopped at Deoli.  

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,240
A girl came down the platform, selling baskets.

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,520
It was a cold morning and the girl had a shawl 
thrown across her shoulders. Her feet were bare  

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,840
and her clothes were old, but she was 
a young girl, walking like a queen.

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,120
When she came to my window, she stopped. 
She saw that I was staring at her, but at  

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:35,040
first she pretended not to notice. She had a pale 
skin, shiny black hair, and dark, troubled eyes.  

27
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,440
And then those eyes, searching 
and expressive, met mine.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:51,680
She stood by my window for some time and neither 
of us said anything. But when she moved on,  

29
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,800
I found myself leaving my 
seat and going to the door.  

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,080
I stepped out and stood waiting on the 
platform, looking the other way, away from her.  

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,360
I walked across to the tea stall. Water was 
boiling over a small fire, but the owner of  

32
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,200
the stall was busy serving tea somewhere on 
the train. The girl followed me to the stall.

33
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,480
'Do you want to buy a basket?' she asked. 
'They are very strong, made of the finest...'

34
00:04:25,280 --> 00:06:35,680
'No,' I said, 'I don't want a 
basket.' suddenly filled with light.  

35
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
We said nothing for some time, but we 
each knew what the other was feeling.

36
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,360
I wanted to put her on the train there 
and then, and take her away with me.  

37
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,480
I hated the idea of having to watch her 
disappear into the distance of Deoli station.  

38
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,840
I took the baskets from her hand 
and put them down on the ground.  

39
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,520
She put out her hand for one of them, 
but I caught her hand and held it.

40
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,680
'I have to go to Delhi,' I said.

41
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,320
She nodded. 'I do not have to go anywhere.'

42
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,840
The guard blew his whistle for the train 
to leave. How I hated him for doing that!

43
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,840
'I will come again,' I said. 'Will you be here?'

44
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,880
She nodded again, and as she nodded, the 
bell rang and the train started to move.  

45
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
I had to pull my hand away from the 
girl and run for the moving train.

46
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
This time I did not forget her.  

47
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
She was with me for the rest of the 
journey, and for long afterwards.  

48
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,800
All that year she was a bright, living thing in 
my mind. And when college finished, I packed and  

49
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,800
left for Dehra earlier than usual. My grandmother 
would be pleased at my eagerness to see her.

50
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,680
I was anxious as the train entered Deoli, because 
I was wondering what I should say to the girl  

51
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,760
and what I should do. I was determined 
not to stand helplessly in front of her,  

52
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,240
unable to speak or express my feelings.

53
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
The train came to Deoli,  

54
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,160
and I looked up and down the platform, 
but I could not see the girl anywhere.

55
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I opened the door and stepped on to the platform, 
deeply disappointed, and fearing the worst.  

56
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,040
I ran up to the stationmaster and said, 'Do you 
know the girl who used to sell baskets here?'

57
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,640
'No, I don't,' he replied. 'And you'd better get 
on the train if you don't want to be left behind.'

58
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,960
But I walked up and down the platform, 
and stared past the station buildings.  

59
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,800
All I saw was a tree and a dusty road leading 
into the jungle. Where did the road go?  

60
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,520
The train was moving out of the station, and I 
had to run up the platform and jump for the door  

61
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,800
of my compartment. Then, as the train gathered 
speed, I sat miserably in front of the window.

62
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,720
What could I do about finding a girl I had seen 
only twice, who had said very little to me,  

63
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:35,200
and about whom I knew nothing - absolutely 
nothing - but for whom I felt a fondness  

64
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
and responsibility that I had never felt before?

65
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,120
My grandmother was not pleased with my 
visit after all, because I only stayed  

66
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,040
at her place for a couple of weeks. Feeling 
restless and worried, I took the train back,  

67
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,640
intending to ask further questions 
of the stationmaster at Deoli.

68
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:04,000
But at Deoli there was a new stationmaster. The 
previous man had been moved to another station,  

69
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,320
and the new man didn't know anything about 
the girl who sold baskets. I found the owner  

70
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
of the tea stall, and asked him if he knew 
anything about the girl with the baskets.

71
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,800
'Yes, there was such a girl here, I remember quite 
well,' he said. 'But she has stopped coming now.'

72
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
'Why?' I asked. 'What happened to her?'

73
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,280
'How should I know?' he said. 'She was nothing to 
me.' And once again I had to run for the train.

74
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,120
As Deoli platform slid away, I decided that 
one day I would have to break my journey there,  

75
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,400
spend a day in the town, make enquiries,  

76
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,280
and find the girl who had stolen my heart with 
nothing but a look from her dark, impatient eyes.

77
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,640
I cheered myself up with this thought 
during my last few months in college.  

78
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,720
I went to Dehra again in the summer and 
when, in the early hours of the morning,  

79
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,640
the night train came into Deoli station, I looked 
up and down the platform for signs of the girl,  

80
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,000
knowing I wouldn't find her 
but hoping just the same.

81
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
Somehow, I couldn't bring myself 
to break my journey at Deoli  

82
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
and spend a day there. (If 
this was a film, I thought,  

83
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,840
I'd get off the train, solve the mystery, and 
provide a suitable ending for the whole thing.)  

84
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,240
I think I was afraid to do this. I was afraid of 
discovering what had really happened to the girl.  

85
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:43,600
Perhaps she was no longer in Deoli, perhaps 
she was married, perhaps she had fallen ill...

86
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,800
In the last few years I have passed through 
Deoli many times, and I always look out of  

87
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,120
the train window, half expecting to see 
the same unchanged face smiling up at me.  

88
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,840
I wonder what happens in Deoli, behind the station 
walls. But I will never break my journey there.  

89
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,320
I prefer to keep hoping and dreaming, 
and looking out of the window up and  

90
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,720
down that lonely platform, waiting 
for the girl with the baskets.

91
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,840
I never break my journey at Deoli, but 
I pass through as often as I can.
 
 

92
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
-  

93
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,457
THE END -
