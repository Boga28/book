00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,899
CHAPTER ONE
One of the Missing

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,700
Private Jerome Searing was a Yankee scout.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,509
He was often sent to watch the movements of
enemy soldiers.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:20,630
A group of army officers was standing on a
hill in Georgia.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,699
They were looking south, toward a forest.

6
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,100
They were wearing blue Yankee uniforms.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,260
A regiment of the Confederate Army was on
the other side of the forest.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:44,210
"Is the enemy moving forward, or retreating,
or not moving at all?" one of the Union officers

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,579
asked.

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:52,640
"We'll send a scout to look," replied another
officer.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:02,380
A few minutes later, Private Searing was sent
to check the position of the Confederate regiment.

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,350
Searing was a brave man.

13
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,590
He worked alone and he did his work well.

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,850
He had sharp eyes and ears.

15
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,170
He could see far into the distance.

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,470
And he often heard sounds that other people
could not hear.

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,440
Now he moved silently through the forest toward
the enemy regiment.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,150
In his hands, he carried a powerful rifle.

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,960
Searing could shoot extremely well.

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,960
When Searing reached the edge of the forest,
he stopped.

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,200
He got down on his hands and knees and crawled
forward slowly.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,439
He was looking for the enemy's picket line.

23
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,680
Pickets guarded the men of their regiment.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,219
They dug holes-rifle-pits-in the ground around
the edge of their camp.

25
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:09,069
The pickets sat in the rifle-pits and aimed
their guns at the enemy.

26
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:15,520
Usually, there were three or four men together
in each rifle-pit.

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,920
The pickets took turns to sleep.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,250
While one man watched, the other men slept.

29
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,660
Scaring was looking for small mounds of earth
on the ground.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,740
The mounds would show Searing where the Confederates
had dug their rifle-pits.

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:43,319
The mounds would also show him where the enemy
had positioned its picket line.

32
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,810
The scout quickly lay flat on the ground.

33
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,290
Through a narrow opening in the hushes, he
had seen a small mound of yellow earth.

34
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,120
It was one of the enemy's rifle-pits.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,530
After a few moments, Searing slowly and carefully
lifted his head.

36
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,209
He looked at the mound of earth for several
more minutes.

37
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,010
Then he stood up and walked forward.

38
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,830
The enemy soldiers had left the rifle-pit.

39
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,800
Searing wanted to be sure that all the Confederate
pickets had gone.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,250
He kept his head low, and ran from one rifle-pit
to the next.

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,930
They were all empty.

42
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,849
The Confederates had left this picket line.

43
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,750
But where were they now?

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,550
Searing walked through the forest until he
came to the edge of a plantation.

45
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:58,150
Beyond the plantation, there was an old farmhouse
on a small hill.

46
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,430
The windows of the building were broken and
there was no door.

47
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,900
"This will be a good place to hide and watch,"
he thought.

48
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,560
He went into the building and looked out of
one of the broken windows.

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,070
Searing stared across the flat, empty ground
that was between the farmhouse and Kennesaw

50
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,920
Mountain.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,870
There were no trees between the farmhouse
and the mountain.

52
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,060
Half a mile away, he could see a road.

53
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,970
It was crowded with soldiers who wore gray
uniforms.

54
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,020
This was the rear guard of the Confederate
regiment.

55
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,490
The metal barrels of their rifles shone in
the morning sunlight.

56
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,650
The Confederates were moving south.

57
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,970
Searing had to return quickly to his own regiment.

58
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,440
He had to report to his commanding officers.

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,900
But the gray line of Confederate soldiers
was in front of him.

60
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,780
Private Searing had a powerful Springfield
rifle.

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,660
He wanted to shoot one of the enemy.

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,010
He lifted his rifle and aimed it at a Confederate
soldier.

63
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,240
But Searing did not kill anyone that bright
summer morning.

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,280
And he did not make a report about the enemy's
movements.

65
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,410
On the side of Kennesaw Mountain, a Confederate
captain was standing beside a cannon.

66
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,180
The distance between the cannon and the farmhouse
was two miles.

67
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,810
The captain saw the group of Yankee officers
on the hill to the north.

68
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,480
He aimed the cannon at them, and fired.

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:10,230
But the shell missed the Union soldiers and
flew off in a different direction.

70
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:16,370
Private Searing was aiming his rifle at the
Confederates on the road.

71
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,490
Suddenly he heard a whistling sound in the
air.

72
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,940
The sound became louder.

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,410
Before he could fire the gun, the roof of
the house fell in.

74
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,449
When Searing opened his eyes, he saw blue
sky.

75
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,710
Where was the roof of the house?

76
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,970
He was half-sitting and half-lying on the
floor, and there were heavy wooden beams all

77
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,090
around him.

78
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,150
The beams had been the roof of the house.

79
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,110
Searing could not move and he was covered
in dust.

80
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,530
The gray dust covered his body, face, clothes
and hair.

81
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:11,810
A large beam was lying across his legs.

82
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,270
The scout's left hand was trapped under many
heavy pieces of wood.

83
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,220
Searing could only move his right arm.

84
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,440
In front of his eyes, the scout saw a ring
of shining metal.

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,490
The ring was, in fact, the muzzle of his Springfield
rifle.

86
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,370
The gun was also trapped among the pieces
of wood and other parts of the roof.

87
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,210
And it was aimed at the center of Searings
forehead.

88
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,900
The powerful rifle was loaded with a bullet.

89
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:59,470
It was ready to fire Searing did not like
to look down the muzzle of his own gun.

90
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,120
He tried to move his body.

91
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,970
"What is holding my head?" he asked himself.

92
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,410
He was able to move one piece of wood a little.

93
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,229
Then he stopped.

94
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,169
"The rifle might fire if I move suddenly,"
he thought.

95
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:25,690
"It looks closer to my head now."

96
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,039
Searing closed his eyes.

97
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,669
"I can't get out," he said to himself.

98
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,260
"I can't move.

99
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,390
I'll sleep now.

100
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,940
The Confederates have gone and some of our
own soldiers will come here soon.

101
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,650
They'll find me."

102
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,000
The scout was extremely tired, but he did
not sleep.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,540
He felt a pain in his forehead.

104
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,270
When he opened his eyes, the pain disappeared.

105
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,560
But when he closed his eyes, the pain returned.

106
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,040
He heard birds singing.

107
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,930
"Help!" he shouted.

108
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,950
He was surprised by the sound of his own voice.

109
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,000
He sounded afraid.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,010
No one came to help him.

111
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,670
Private Searing could not sleep and he could
not look away from the gun.

112
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,750
But, at last, he became unconscious.

113
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,890
When he woke up again, Searing knew that his
hand was bleeding.

114
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:50,450
He could not see his hand, but he could feel
blood pouring from it.

115
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,430
Then he saw some small, brown animals running
over the wooden beams.

116
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,930
They were rats!

117
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,769
Rats were climbing near the rifle!

118
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,410
But the rifle did not fire.

119
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,200
At last the rats ran away.

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,029
Searing knew that they would return later.

121
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,110
Then they would attack him.

122
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,920
They would bite his face, neck and hands.

123
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,110
He hoped to be dead before that happened.

124
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:36,060
Private Jerome Searing was a brave man, but
he was tired and in pain.

125
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,380
More and more of his blood was pouring from
his injured hand.

126
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,760
He was very weak and he was terrified.

127
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,459
He was suffering, and no one was coming to
help him.

128
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,920
He tried to lift a small piece of wood with
his right hand.

129
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,730
"Can I move the piece of wood so that it touches
the rifle?" he thought.

130
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:10,959
"Maybe I can push the rifle so that it isn't
aimed at my head."

131
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,800
Searing slowly moved the piece of wood along
the barrel of the gun.

132
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,490
He could not push the barrel away, but now
he could feel the trigger of the rifle.

133
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,010
He knew that he wanted to die now.

134
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,010
He closed his eyes and pushed the wood against
the trigger.

135
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,820
Nothing happened.

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,910
The rifle did not fire.

137
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:49,110
Private Jerome Searing knew that the pain
in his head was part of his dream.

138
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,089
He dreamed that the bullet went into his head.

139
00:11:54,089 --> 00:12:03,459
At last, the fear of the bullet killed him.

140
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:06,820
Lieutenant Adrian Searing looked at his watch.

141
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,690
The time was eighteen minutes past eight.

142
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,940
The lieutenant was in command of the Yankee
pickets on the hill.

143
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,330
He knew that his brother, Private Jerome Searing,
was scouting somewhere near the hill.

144
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:31,040
Adrian was waiting for Jerome to return and
report about the enemy's pickets.

145
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,350
Suddenly, Adrian Searing heard a noise in
the distance.

146
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,149
It was like the sound of a building falling
down.

147
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:45,750
The sound was coming from the south.

148
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,400
At the same moment, an officer came toward
him.

149
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:56,980
"Lieutenant Searing," said the officer, "The
colonel orders you to move your men forward.

150
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,300
You must look for the enemy.

151
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,540
We think that the Confederates have retreated."

152
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,290
The lieutenant ordered his men to move down
the hill.

153
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,700
They went through the forest and came to the
edge of the plantation.

154
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,430
A wooden farmhouse had stood on a small hill
beside the plantation.

155
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,490
The building was now destroyed.

156
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,450
The walls and the roof had fallen.

157
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:37,420
The Yankees passed by on both sides of the
house and moved toward Kennesaw Mountain.

158
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,699
Lieutenant Searing came to the farmhouse.

159
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:46,370
He looked inside building and saw the body
of a dead man.

160
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,850
The body was buried under a pile of big, wooden
beams.

161
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,850
It was completely covered with gray dust.

162
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,120
The man s uniform was gray.

163
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,570
His skin and hair were gray.

164
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:09,450
His pale face was very thin and his eyes were
staring in terror.

165
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,720
The ground beneath his body was soaked with
blood.

166
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:23,480
"I guess that this Confederate has been dead
for a week, the lieutenant said to himself.

167
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,100
"Maybe he was killed when the building fell."

168
