00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,480
by Antoine Galland

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,480
OPEN SESAME

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,960
Ali Baba was a woodcutter.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,920
He was from Persia, in the Middle East.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,521
One day he was at work in the woods when he saw forty men on
forty black horses.

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,401
They stopped near a huge rock.

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:40,721
They had forty big, heavy, brown sacks on their backs.

9
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:47,281
Ali Baba watched the men as they got off their horses.

10
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:58,601
A tall man walked to the rock and said "Open Sesame." Ali
Baba looked and looked again...

11
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:03,361
Something amazing happened... the rock opened!

12
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:07,081
Behind the rock was a cave.

13
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,441
The forty men went into the cave with their sacks.

14
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:20,722
Later, when the men came out of the cave, they didn't have
their sacks.

15
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:28,882
"Close Sesame," said the tall man, and the rock closed!

16
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:34,882
The forty men got on their horses and went away.

17
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,922
Ali Baba went to the rock.

18
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:41,642
"Open Sesame," he said.

19
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:50,802
The rock opened... and inside the cave there were hundreds
of sacks and wooden boxes.

20
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:56,722
Ali Baba opened a sack and... it was full of diamonds!

21
00:01:56,722 --> 00:02:03,642
He opened another sack and... it was full of gold coins!

22
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:09,003
He opened a box and... it was full of silver!

23
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:16,323
He opened another box and... it was full of beautiful
jewels!

24
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:19,883
"These forty men are thieves," thought Ali.

25
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:27,723
"I'm going to take some of these coins home for my wife!"

26
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:34,683
He put some gold coins into his bag and went out of the
cave.

27
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:37,923
"Close Sesame," he said.

28
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:41,363
The rock closed and he went home.

29
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:46,283
Ali Baba's wife, Nasreen, was in the kitchen.

30
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:55,083
Ali Baba told her about the forty thieves and the treasure
in the cave.

31
00:02:55,083 --> 00:03:00,524
"This is wonderful news," said Nasreen.

32
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:08,284
"Can we take more money and buy a new house and new
clothes?"

33
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:13,844
"Yes, but we mustn't tell anyone," said Ali.

34
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:19,284
"The forty thieves are very dangerous men."

35
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:25,724
Ali's brother, Cassim, was outside the kitchen.

36
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,804
He opened the door.

37
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:33,644
"Tell me where the cave is!" he shouted.

38
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:41,124
"You must tell me or I'm going to go and look for it
myself!"

39
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:47,724
"No! Don't do that!" said Ali.

40
00:03:47,724 --> 00:04:03,245
"Go into the woods. There's a huge rock near the big baobab tree. The rock opens when you say "Open Sesame" and closes
when you say "Close Sesame".

41
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:13,525
Cassim went to the rock. "Open Sesame," he said. He went
into the cave and the rock closed.

42
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:22,285
"This is amazing," thought Cassim. "Gold, silver...
beautiful jewels!"

43
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:29,685
He had three big sacks with him and filled them with gold
and silver and jewels.

44
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:38,285
He stood in front of the rock and said "Open Wheat", but the
rock didn't open!

45
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:44,126
He said "Open Corn," but the rock didn't open!

46
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:49,166
"Oh! What is the right word?" he thought.

47
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,846
Cassim was angry.

48
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:54,366
He couldn't remember the word!

49
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:59,406
He sat down to think, but suddenly he heard horses.

50
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:03,446
The forty thieves were outside the cave!

51
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,086
Look!

52
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,846
A horse!

53
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,886
Someone's in our cave!

54
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:15,526
"He can't have our treasure! He must die!" said the tall
man.

55
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:21,726
The next morning Cassim's wife, Zhila, went to Ali Baba.

56
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:30,726
"Cassim didn't come home last night! Do you know where he
is?" she asked.

57
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:34,807
Ali told Zhila about the cave.

58
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:45,487
"Please go to the cave! The thieves are dangerous men.
They'll kill him!" she said.

59
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:48,567
Ali went to the rock.

60
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:52,967
It was closed but he heard a noise.

61
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:57,207
"Cassim, are you there?" he said.

62
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:03,767
"Yes, yes... I'm here. Help me! I'm hurt."

63
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:12,207
"Open Sesame," said Ali Baba and the rock opened.

64
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:17,087
Cassim was on the floor... he couldn't walk!

65
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,288
"The thieves said I must die but I didn't die!" he said.

66
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:33,768
"You didn't die but you're hurt! Let's go home now and the
doctor can come to the house later tonight."

67
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:39,008
The next afternoon the thieves went back to the cave.

68
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:45,048
"He isn't here!" said the tall man.

69
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:54,808
"We must find him. He was hurt! We must find the doctor who
helped him!"

70
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:59,088
The tall man found the doctor's house.

71
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,368
He was angry.

72
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:10,008
"Where's the man you helped yesterday? Where's his house?"
he asked.

73
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:13,449
"I don't know," said the doctor.

74
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,569
"It was dark and I couldn't see the road or the houses."

75
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:26,929
"Then take me to the house tonight when it's dark," said the
tall man.

76
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:38,569
The, doctor took the tall man to Ali's house later that
night and the tall man painted a white cross on the door.

77
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:45,489
"Now I know where Cassim and his family live," he thought.

78
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:51,329
"They must all die! And I've got a plan!"

79
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:59,169
The tall man went to the market and bought thirty-nine big
oil pots.

80
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:06,730
"Put the pots on your horses then hide inside them" he told
the thieves.

81
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:17,770
"I'm going to Ali Baba's house and you'll be in the pots.
We'll kill them all tonight when they are asleep!"

82
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,930
That evening he went to Ali Baba's house.

83
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:35,050
"Good evening. I'm an oil merchant from India and I'm very tired," he said "Have you got a room where I can sleep and a
place for my horses?"

84
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,930
"Of course! Welcome to my home," said Ali.

85
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,090
Zhila was in the kitchen with Nasreen.

86
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,970
"That man isn't Indian; he's Persian," said Zhila.

87
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:58,611
"I don't like him. Let's go and look at the pots on his
horses."

88
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:03,011
They went out of the house into the garden.

89
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:09,731
There were lots of stars in the sky and everything was very
quiet.

90
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:18,051
Suddenly they heard a man's voice: "When are we going to
kill Cassim and AliBaba and their wives?"

91
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"When they're asleep," said another voice.

92
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The women looked at the pots on the horses.

93
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
Thirty-nine pots in their garden... thirty-nine men in the
pots, and one man in the house...

94
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The Forty Thieves!

95
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Quickly!" said Zhila.

96
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Open the gate."

97
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
Nasreen opened the gate.

98
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Shoo, shoo, go away! Shoo, shoo, go away!" they shouted at
the horses.

99
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The horses ran out of the garden.

100
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
They ran and they ran and they ran.

101
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
They ran into the desert and never came back.

102
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The tall man went into the garden when everyone was
sleeping.

103
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
His horses weren't there!

104
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
His pots weren't there!

105
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
His men weren't there!

106
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
He ran out of the garden, he ran into the desert, but he
couldn't see his horses or his men.

107
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
He ran and he ran and he ran and he never came back.

108
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
In the morning Cassim and Ali Baba woke up early and went
into the garden.

109
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"This is very strange," said Ali.

110
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The oil merchant isn't here, and his horses aren't here!

111
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
Where are they?"

112
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"You men are very silly," said Nasreen.

113
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Yes, very silly," said Zhila.

114
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"The oil merchant from India wasn't an oil merchant from
India."

115
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"No," said Nasreen.

116
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"He was the leader of the forty thieves!"

117
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Where are the forty thieves now?" said Cassim.

118
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"They ran into the desert, and let's hope they'll never come
back!" said Zhila.

119
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Tomorrow you can go and get the treasure and we'll give
some to everyone in the village!"

120
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The next day Cassim and Ali Baba went back to the rock with
ten grey donkeys.

121
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Open Wheat," said Cassim.

122
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"No, silly! Don't you remember? It's not Wheat. It's
Sesame!" said Ali Baba.

123
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Of course, the word is "Sesame". Open Sesame," said Cassim.

124
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
The rock opened and they put all the wooden boxes and sacks
of treasure on the donkeys.

125
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
Then they went back to the village and gave the treasure to
the poor villagers.

126
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
"Thank you, Nasreen and Zhila" said the villagers.

127
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,091
"You're very clever women!"
