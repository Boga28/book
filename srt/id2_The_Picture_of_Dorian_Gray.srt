CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,440
An Extraordinarily Beautiful Young Man

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,080
The room was filled with the smell of roses. 
Sitting on a sofa, smoking a cigarette,  

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,000
was Lord Henry Wotton. Through the open door 
came the distant sounds of the London streets.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,240
In the centre of the room stood a portrait 
of an extraordinarily beautiful young man.  

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,880
Sitting a little distance in front 
of it was the artist himself,  

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Basil Hallward. As the painter 
looked at the portrait, he smiled.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
'It is your best work, Basil, the 
best thing you have ever done,'  

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,240
said Lord Henry, slowly. 'You really must 
send it next year to the Grosvenor. The  

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,080
Grosvenor is really the only place 
to exhibit a painting like that.'

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,680
'I don't think I shall send it anywhere,' the 
painter answered, moving his head in that odd  

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,120
way that used to make his friends laugh at him at 
Oxford University. 'No: I won't send it anywhere.'

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
Lord Henry looked at him in surprise through 
the thin blue smoke of his cigarette.  

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,440
'Not send it anywhere? My dear man, why 
not? What odd people you painters are!'

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,480
'I know you will laugh at me,' Basil replied,  

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,160
'but I really can't exhibit it. I 
have put too much of myself into it.'

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,680
Lord Henry stretched himself 
out on the sofa and laughed.  

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,880
'Too much of yourself in it! Basil, this man 
is truly beautiful. He does not look like you.'

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,600
'You don't understand me, Harry,' answered the 
artist. 'Of course I am not like him. I would  

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,240
be sorry to look like him. It is better 
not to be different from other people.  

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,720
The stupid and ugly have the best 
of this world. Dorian Gray -'

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,080
'Dorian Gray? Is that his name?' asked Lord Henry, 
walking across the room towards Basil Hallward.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,880
'Yes, that is his name. I 
wasn't going to tell you.'

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,880
'But why not?'

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,320
'Oh, I can't explain. When I like people 
enormously I never tell their names to anyone.  

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
I suppose you think that's very foolish?'

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,560
'Not at all,' answered Lord Henry, 'not at all, 
my dear Basil. You forget that I am married, so  

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,160
my life is full of secrets. I never know where my 
wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.  

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,520
When we meet we tell each other 
lies with the most serious faces.'

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,560
'I hate the way you talk about your married 
life, Harry,' said Basil Hallward, walking  

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,320
towards the door that led into the garden. 'I 
believe you are really a very good husband,  

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,120
but that you are ashamed of it. You never say 
a good thing, and you never do a wrong thing.'

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,400
Lord Henry laughed and the two men went out into 
the garden together. After a pause, Lord Henry  

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,920
pulled out his watch. 'I am afraid I have to go, 
Basil,' he said in a quiet voice. 'But before I go  

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,800
I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit 
Dorian Grays picture. I want the real reason.'

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
'I told you the real reason.'

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,840
'No, you did not.  

38
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,640
You said that it was because there was too 
much of yourself in it. Now, that is childish.'

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,160
'Harry,' said Basil Hallward, 
looking him straight in the face,  

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,440
'every portrait that is painted with feeling is a 
portrait of the artist, not the sitter. I will not  

41
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,120
exhibit this picture because I am afraid that 
I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.'

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
Lord Henry laughed. 'And what is that?' he asked.

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,400
'Oh, there is really very little to 
tell, Harry,' answered the painter,  

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,280
'and I don't think you will understand. 
Perhaps you won't believe it.'

45
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Lord Henry smiled and picked a flower 
from the grass. 'I am quite sure I'll  

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,840
understand it,' he replied, staring at 
the flower,' and I can believe anything.'

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,000
'The story is simply this,' said the painter. 'Two 
months ago I went to a party at Lady Brandon's.  

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,920
After I had been in the room for about ten 
minutes, I suddenly realized that someone  

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:02,640
was looking at me. I turned around and saw Dorian 
Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt  

50
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,840
the blood leaving my face. I knew that this boy 
would become my whole soul, my whole art itself.'

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
'What did you do?'

52
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
'We were quite close, almost 
touching. Our eyes met again.  

53
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.'

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
'What did Lady Brandon say about Mr Dorian Gray?'

55
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,920
'Oh, something like "Charming boy. I don't know 
what he does - I think he doesn't do anything.  

56
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Oh, yes, he plays the piano - or 
is it the violin, dear Mr Gray?"  

57
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
Dorian and I both laughed and 
we became friends at once.'

58
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,080
'Laughter is not at all a bad beginning 
for a friendship,' said the young lord,  

59
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,320
picking another flower, 'and 
it is the best ending for one.'

60
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,480
Hallward shook his head. 'You 
don't understand what friendship  

61
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,840
is, Harry. Everyone is the same to you.'

62
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,000
'That's not true!' cried Lord Henry, pushing 
his hat back, and looking at the summer sky.  

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
'I choose my friends for their beauty 
and my enemies for their intelligence.  

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,080
A man cannot be too careful 
in choosing his enemies.  

65
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,040
Of course, I hate my relations. And I hate poor 
people because they are ugly, stupid and drunk -'

66
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,560
'I don't agree with a word you have said. 
And I feel sure that you don't agree either.'

67
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Lord Henry touched his pointed 
brown beard with his finger,  

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
and the toe of his boot with his stick.  

69
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,960
'How English you are, Basil! An Englishman is 
only interested in whether he agrees with an idea,  

70
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:01,920
not whether it is right or wrong. But tell me more 
about Mr Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?'

71
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
'Every day. I couldn't be happy 
if I didn't see him every day.'

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
'How extraordinary! I thought 
you only cared about your art.'

73
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
'He is all my art to me now,' said the painter.  

74
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,760
'I know that the work I have done since I met 
Dorian Gray is the best work of my life. In some  

75
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,560
strange way his personality has shown me 
a new kind of art. He seems like a little  

76
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,200
boy - though he is really more than twenty - and 
when he is with me I see the world differently.'

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,840
'Basil, this is extraordinary! 
I must see Dorian Gray.'

78
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Hallward got up from his seat and walked up and 
down the garden. After some time he came back.  

79
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,720
'Harry,' he said. 'Dorian 
Gray is the reason for my art.  

80
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
You might see nothing in him. 
I see everything in him.'

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
'Then why won't you exhibit his 
portrait?' asked Lord Henry.

82
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,960
'An artist should paint beautiful things, but 
he should put nothing of his own life into them.  

83
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Some day I will show the 
world what that beauty is.  

84
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,840
For that reason the world will never 
see my portrait of Dorian Gray.'

85
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,400
'I think you are wrong, Basil, 
but I won't argue with you.  

86
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,720
Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?'

87
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,920
The painter thought for a few moments. 
'He likes me,' he answered, after a pause.  

88
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,240
'I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him 
too much and tell him things that I should not.  

89
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,920
He is usually very charming to me, and we 
spend thousands of wonderful hours together.  

90
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,400
But sometimes he can be horribly thoughtless 
and seems to enjoy causing me pain.  

91
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Then I feel, Harry, that I have given my whole  

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,920
soul to someone who uses it like a flower 
to put in his coat on a summer's day.'

93
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,640
'Summer days are long, Basil,' 
said Lord Henry in a quiet voice.  

94
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,200
'Perhaps you will get bored before he will. 
Intelligence lives longer than beauty.  

95
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
One day you will look at your friend and 
you won't like his colour or something.  

96
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
And then you will begin to think that 
he has behaved badly towards you -'

97
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,640
'Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I 
live, Dorian Gray will be everything to me.  

98
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
You can't feel what I feel. You change too often.'

99
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,840
'My dear Basil, that is exactly why I can 
feel it.' Lord Henry took a cigarette from  

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:04,240
his pretty silver box and lit it. Then he turned 
to Hallward and said, 'I have just remembered.'

101
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,280
'Remembered what, Harry?'

102
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,040
'Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.'

103
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,280
'Where was it?' asked Hallward with a frown.

104
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,880
'Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt's, 
Lady Agatha's. She told me that she had discovered  

105
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,320
this wonderful young man. He was going to help 
her work with the poor people in the East End  

106
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,440
of London, and his name was Dorian Gray. Of 
course I didn't know it was your friend.'

107
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
'I am very glad you didn't, Harry.'

108
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,080
'Why?'

109
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
'I don't want you to meet him.'

110
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,440
A servant came into the garden. 'Mr Dorian 
Gray is waiting in the house, sir,' he said.

111
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,480
'You must introduce me now,' 
cried Lord Henry, laughing.

112
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,320
The painter turned to his servant. 'Ask Mr Gray 
to wait, Parker. I will come in in a few moments.'

113
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Then he looked at Lord Henry. 
'Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,'  

114
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,440
he said. 'He is a beautiful person. Don't 
spoil him. Don't try and influence him.  

115
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,560
Your influence would be bad. Don't take away from 
me the one person who makes me a true artist.'

116
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
'What silly things you say!' said Lord Henry.  

117
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Smiling, he took Hallward by the arm 
and almost led him into the house.
 
 

118
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,640
CHAPTER TWO

119
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Jealous of his Own Portrait

120
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,400
As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was 
sitting at the piano, with his back to them,  

121
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,280
and he was turning the pages 
of some music by Schumann.  

122
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,880
'You must lend me these, Basil,' he cried. 'I 
want to learn them. They are perfectly charming.'

123
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,280
'Perhaps if you sit well for me today, Dorian.'

124
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,880
'Oh, I am bored with sitting, and 
I don't want a portrait of myself,'  

125
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,040
answered the boy, turning quickly. When he saw 
Lord Henry, his face went red for a moment.  

126
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
'I am sorry, Basil. I didn't know 
that you had anyone with you.'

127
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,560
'This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian. He's an old 
friend of mine. We went to Oxford together. I  

128
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,200
have just been telling him what a good sitter 
you were, and now you have spoiled everything.'

129
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,600
'You have not spoiled my pleasure in 
meeting you, Mr Gray,' said Lord Henry,  

130
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,280
stepping forward and offering his hand. 
'My aunt has often spoken to me about you.'

131
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,960
'I am afraid Lady Agatha is annoyed with me at the 
moment. I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel  

132
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,800
with her last Tuesday, and I forgot all about 
it. I don't know what she will say to me.'

133
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:06,000
Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly 
wonderfully handsome, with his curved red lips,  

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,360
honest blue eyes and gold hair. 'Oh, don't 
worry about my aunt. You are one of her  

135
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,320
favourite people. And you are too charming 
to waste time working tor poor people.'

136
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,560
Lord Henry sat down on the sofa and opened 
his cigarette box. The painter was busy mixing  

137
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,800
colours and getting his brushes ready. Suddenly, 
he looked at Lord Henry and said, 'Harry, I want  

138
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,320
to finish this picture today. Would you think 
it very rude of me if I asked you to go away?'

139
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,520
Lord Henry smiled, and looked at Dorian 
Gray. 'Shall I go, Mr Gray?' he asked.

140
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,640
'Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that 
Basil is in one of his difficult moods,  

141
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,560
and I hate it when he is difficult. And I want you 
to tell me why I should not help the poor people.'

142
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
'That would be very boring, Mr Gray.  

143
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,640
But I certainly will not run away if you 
do not want me to. Is that all right,  

144
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Basil? You have often told me that you like 
your sitters to have someone to talk to.'

145
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:29,920
Hallward bit his lip. 'If that is what Dorian 
wants. Dorian always gets what he wants.'

146
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,000
Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves. 
'No, I am afraid I must go. Goodbye, Mr Gray.  

147
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,680
Come and see me one afternoon in Curzon Street. 
I am nearly always at home at five o'clock.'

148
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,800
'Basil,' cried Dorian Gray, 'If Lord Henry Wotton 
goes, I will go too. You never open your lips  

149
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,840
while you are painting, and it is horribly 
boring just standing here. Ask him to stay.'

150
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,280
'All right, please stay, Harry. For Dorian and 
for me,' said Hallward, staring at his picture.  

151
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,400
'It is true that I never talk when I 
am working, and never listen either.  

152
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,440
It must be very boring for my sitters. Sit 
down again, Harry. And Dorian don't move about  

153
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,320
too much, or listen to what Lord Henry says. He 
has a very bad influence over all his friends.'

154
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,920
Dorian Gray stood while Hallward finished 
his portrait. He liked what he had seen of  

155
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,840
Lord Henry. He was so different to Basil! And he 
had such a beautiful voice. After a few moments  

156
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,400
he said to him, 'Have you really a very bad 
influence, Lord Henry? As bad as Basil says?'

157
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,520
'Influence is always bad.'

158
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,280
'Why?'

159
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,880
'Because to influence someone is to give them your 
soul. Each person must have his own personality.'

160
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
'Turn your head a little more to the 
right, Dorian,' said the painter.  

161
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,840
He was not listening to the conversation and only 
knew that there was a new look on the boy's face.

162
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:19,120
'And yet,' continued Lord Henry, in his low 
musical voice, 'I believe that if one man  

163
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,920
lived his life fully and completely he could 
change the world. He would be a work of art  

164
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,880
greater than anything we have ever imagined. But 
the bravest man among us is afraid of himself.  

165
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,640
You, Mr Gray, are very young but you have had 
passions that have made you afraid, dreams -'

166
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,280
'Stop!' cried Dorian Gray, 'I don't understand 
what you are saying. I need to think.'

167
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,280
For nearly ten minutes he stood there with 
his lips open and his eyes strangely bright.  

168
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,000
The words that Basil's friend 
had spoken had touched his soul.  

169
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes, there had been things in his boyhood that 
he had not understood. He understood them now.

170
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,080
With his smile, Lord Henry watched him. He 
knew the exact moment when to say nothing.  

171
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,200
He was surprised at the sudden effect of his 
words on the boy. How fascinating the boy was!

172
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,920
Hallward continued painting and did 
not notice that the others were silent.

173
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,440
"Basil, I am tired,' cried Dorian Gray, suddenly.  

174
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
'I must go and sit in the 
garden. There is no air in here.'

175
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,920
'My dear boy, I am sorry. When I am painting, my 
work is all I can think about. But you never sat  

176
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,920
better. I don't know what Harry has been saying 
to you, but there is a wonderful bright look in  

177
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,840
your eyes. I suppose he has been flattering 
you. You shouldn't believe a word he says.'

178
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,880
'He has certainly not been flattering me. Perhaps  

179
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,760
that is why I don't believe 
anything he has told me.'

180
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,280
'You know you believe it all,' said Lord 
Henry, looking at him with his dreamy eyes.  

181
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,120
'I will go out to the garden with 
you. It's horribly hot in this room.'

182
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,320
'Don't keep Dorian too long,' said the painter. 
'This is going to be my best painting.'

183
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,720
Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found 
Dorian Gray holding a flower to his face.  

184
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,840
He came close to him, and 
put his hand on his shoulder.

185
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Dorian Gray frowned and turned away. He liked the 
tall young man who was standing by him. His dark,  

186
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,880
romantic face interested him. There was something 
in his low, musical voice that was fascinating.  

187
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,400
But he felt a little afraid. Why was this stranger 
having a strong influence on him like this?  

188
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
He had known Basil Hallward for 
months, but the friendship between them  

189
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,400
had not changed him. Suddenly someone 
had come into his life and turned it  

190
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
upside down. Someone who seemed to have 
the key to the mystery of life itself.

191
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,840
And yet, what was there to be afraid of?  

192
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,720
He was not a schoolboy or a 
girl. It was silly to be afraid.

193
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,160
'Let us go and sit out of the sun. I 
don't want you to be burnt by the sun.'

194
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,800
'What does that matter?' cried Dorian Gray,  

195
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,920
laughing as he sat down on the 
seat at the end of the garden.

196
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,920
'It should matter very much to you, Mr Gray.'

197
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,600
'Why?'

198
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,800
'Because you are young, and to be 
young is the best thing in the world.'

199
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
'I don't feel that, Lord Henry.'

200
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,080
'No, you don't feel it now. Some 
day when you are old and ugly  

201
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,600
you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, 
you charm the world. Will it always be so?...  

202
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,560
You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray.'

203
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,920
'I don't think -'

204
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,560
'Don't frown. It is true. The 
gods have been good to you.  

205
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,000
But what the gods give they quickly take away. 
You have only a few years in which to really live,  

206
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,760
perfectly and fully. Live your life 
now, while you are still young!'

207
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Suddenly the painter appeared at the 
door and waved at them to come in.  

208
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
They turned to each other and smiled.

209
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,840
'I am waiting,' he cried. 'Please 
come in. The light is perfect.'

210
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
They got up and walked towards the house together.

211
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,320
'You are glad you have met me, Mr 
Gray,' said Lord Henry, looking at him.

212
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,240
'Yes, I am glad now. I wonder 
whether I will always be glad.'

213
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,080
'Always! That is a terrible word. 
Women are so fond of using it.'

214
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,640
Twenty minutes later Hallward stopped painting. 
He stood back and looked at the portrait for  

215
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,800
a few moments. Then he bent down and signed his 
name in red paint on the bottom left-hand corner.

216
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,560
'It is finished,' he cried.

217
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,280
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. 
It was certainly a wonderful work of art.

218
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,000
'My dear man,' he said. 'It is 
the best portrait of our time.  

219
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
Mr Gray, come over and look at yourself.'

220
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,320
Dorian walked across to look at the painting. 
When he saw it his cheeks went red with pleasure.  

221
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,800
He felt that he recognized his own beauty for the 
first time. But then he remembered what Lord Henry  

222
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,960
had said. His beauty would only be there for 
a few years. One day he would be old and ugly.

223
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
'Don't you like it?' cried Hallward, not 
understanding why the boy was silent.

224
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,800
'Of course he likes it,' said Lord Henry. 'It 
is one of the greatest paintings in modern art.  

225
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
I will pay anything you ask 
for it. I must have it.'

226
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,720
'It is not mine to sell, Harry.'

227
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,400
'Whose is it?'

228
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
'Dorian's, of course,' answered the painter.

229
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
'He is very lucky.'

230
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,480
'How sad it is!' said Dorian Gray, who 
was still staring at his own portrait.  

231
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,720
'I will grow old and horrible. But 
this painting will always stay young.  

232
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,960
It will never be older than this day in 
June... if only it were the other way!'

233
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,840
'What do you mean?' asked Hallward.

234
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:16,480
'If I could stay young and the picture grow old! 
For that - for that - I would give everything!  

235
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I 
would not give! I would give my soul for that!'

236
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,160
'I don't think you would like that, 
Basil,' cried Lord Henry, laughing.

237
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,840
'I certainly would not, Harry,' said Hallward.

238
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,640
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. 'You 
like your art better than your friends.'

239
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,400
The painter stared in surprise. 
Why was Dorian speaking like that?  

240
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,840
What had happened? His face was 
red, and he seemed quite angry.

241
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
'You will always like this painting. 
But how long will you like me?  

242
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
Until I start getting old. Lord 
Henry Wotton is perfectly right.  

243
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,360
When I lose my beauty, I will lose everything. 
I shall kill myself before I get old.'

244
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,480
Hallward turned white, and caught his hand. 
'Dorian! Dorian!' he cried. 'Don't talk like that.  

245
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,880
I have never had a friend like 
you, and I will never have another.  

246
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,880
How can you be jealous of a painting? You 
are more beautiful than any work of art.'

247
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,840
'I am jealous of everything 
whose beauty does not die.  

248
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,800
I am jealous of the portrait you have painted 
of me. Why should it keep what I must lose?'  

249
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,080
Hot tears came into his eyes as 
he threw himself on the sofa.

250
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,040
'You did this, Harry,' said the painter, angrily.

251
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,040
Lord Henry shook his head. 'It is 
the real Dorian Gray - that is all.'

252
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,960
'Harry, I can't argue with two of my best 
friends at once. Between you both you have  

253
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,600
made me hate the best piece of work 
I have ever done. I will destroy it.'

254
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,360
Dorian Gray watched as Hallward walked over to 
the painting- table and picked up a knife. The  

255
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,040
boy jumped from the sofa, tore the knife from 
Hallward's hand and threw it across the room.  

256
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,840
'Don't, Basil!' he cried. 'Don't murder it!'

257
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,360
'I am glad that you like my work at last, Dorian,'  

258
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,040
said the painter coldly. 'I 
never thought you would.'

259
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,360
'Like it? I am in love with it, Basil. 
It is part of myself. I feel that.'

260
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,280
'What silly people you are, 
both of you!' said Lord Henry.  

261
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,400
'Let's forget about the painting for 
one night and go to the theatre.'

262
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,880
'I would like to come to the 
theatre with you, Lord Henry.'

263
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
'And you will come too, won't you Basil?'

264
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,840
'I can't,' said Hallward. 'I 
have too much work to do.'

265
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,480
'Well, you and I will go together, Mr Gray.'

266
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,160
The painter bit his lip and 
walked over to the picture.

267
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,200
'I will stay with the real 
Dorian,' he said sadly.
 
 

268
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,480
CHAPTER THREE

269
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,680
Dorian in Love

270
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,880
One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray 
was sitting in the little library of Lord  

271
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,200
Henry's house in Mayfair. Lord Henry 
had not yet come in. He was always late.  

272
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Dorian Gray was bored and once or 
twice he thought of going away.

273
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,560
At last he heard a step outside and the door 
opened. 'How late you are, Harry!' he said.

274
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
'I'm afraid it is not Harry, 
Mr Gray. It is only his wife.'

275
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,440
He looked around quickly and got to 
his feet. 'I am sorry. I thought -'

276
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,000
'I know you quite well by your photographs. I 
think my husband has got seventeen of them.'

277
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
'Seventeen, Lady Henry?'

278
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,520
'Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the 
other night at the theatre. But here is Harry!'

279
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
Lord Henry smiled at them both. 
'So sorry I am late, Dorian.'

280
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,720
'I am afraid I must go,' said Lady 
Harry. 'Goodbye, Mr Gray. Goodbye, Harry.  

281
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,840
You are eating out, I suppose? I am 
too. Perhaps I will see you later.'

282
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,040
'Perhaps, my dear,' said Lord 
Harry, shutting the door behind her.  

283
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,360
Then he lit a cigarette and 
threw himself down on the sofa.

284
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,880
'Never marry a woman with 
fair hair, Dorian,' he said.

285
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,720
'Why, Harry?'

286
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,120
'Because they are romantic.'

287
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,240
'But I like romantic people.'

288
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
'Never marry at all, Dorian.'

289
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,040
'I don't think I will marry, 
Harry. I am too much in love.'

290
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
'Who are you in love with?' 
asked Lord Henry, after a pause.

291
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,080
'With an actress,' said Dorian Gray.

292
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
'How ordinary.'

293
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
'You would not say that if you saw her, Harry.'

294
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
'Who is she?'

295
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
'Her name is Sibyl Vane.'

296
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,920
'I've never heard of her.'

297
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,800
'No one has. People will some 
day, though. She is an artist.'

298
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,000
'My dear boy, no woman is an artist. 
Women never have anything to say  

299
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
but they say it charmingly. 
How long have you known her?'

300
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
'About three weeks.'

301
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
'And where did you meet her?'

302
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,760
'I will tell you, Harry, but you must 
not laugh. After all, it was you who  

303
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,280
gave me a passion to know everything 
about life. For days after I met you  

304
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,320
I searched the streets for beauty. I walked around 
the East End until I found a dirty little theatre.  

305
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,320
I see you are laughing. It is horrible of you!'

306
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,040
'I am not laughing, Dorian. 
Go on with your story.'

307
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,240
'The play was Romeo and Juliet. At first I was 
annoyed at the thought of seeing Shakespeare  

308
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,720
in such a terrible place. And when a fat old 
gentleman came out as Romeo I nearly walked  

309
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:56,000
out. But then I saw Juliet! Harry, she was the 
loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.'

310
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
'When did you meet her?'

311
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,760
'I went back the next night and the 
night after that. On the third evening  

312
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,840
I waited for her outside the theatre.'

313
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,840
'What was she like?'

314
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,040
'Sibyl? Oh, she was shy and gentle. She is 
only seventeen and there is something of a  

315
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:24,080
child in her. She said to me, "You look like 
a prince. I must call you Prince Charming".'

316
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,840
'Miss Sibyl knows how to flatter you.'

317
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,000
'You don't understand her, Harry. She thinks 
that I am like a person in Shakespeare.  

318
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,440
She knows nothing of life. Sibyl 
is the only thing I care about.'

319
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,640
'That is the reason, I suppose, that 
you never have dinner with me now.  

320
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I thought it might be something romantic.'

321
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,560
'My dear Harry, we eat together 
every day,' said Dorian.

322
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,200
'You always come very late.'

323
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,200
'Well, I have to see Sibyl play,' he cried.

324
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,840
'Can you have dinner with me tonight, Dorian?'

325
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,560
He shook his head. 'Tonight she is Ophelia,' he 
answered, 'and tomorrow night she will be Juliet.'

326
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
'When is she Sibyl Vane?'

327
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,520
'Never.'

328
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
'That's good.'

329
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,720
'How horrible you are! But when you see her you 
will think differently. I want you and Basil to  

330
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,440
come and watch her tomorrow night. You are 
certain to recognize that she is wonderful.'

331
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,960
'All right. Tomorrow evening. Will you see 
Basil before then? Or shall I write to him?'

332
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,920
'Dear Basil! I haven't seen him for a week. 
It is rather horrible of me as he sent me my  

333
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,280
portrait a few days ago. I love looking 
at it. Perhaps you should write to him.  

334
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,440
I don't want to see him alone. He says things 
that annoy me. He gives me good advice.'

335
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,440
Lord Henry smiled. 'People are very fond of 
giving away advice they need themselves.'

336
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,840
'Oh, Basil is a good man, but I don't think 
he really understands about art and beauty.  

337
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,840
Since I have known you, Harry, 
I have discovered that.'

338
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,240
'Basil, my dear boy, puts everything 
that is charming in him into his work.'

339
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,120
'I must go now, Harry. My Juliet is waiting 
for me. Don't forget about tomorrow. Goodbye.'

340
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,240
As Dorian left the room, Lord Henry began to think 
about what he had just learned. Certainly few  

341
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,200
people had ever interested him so much as Dorian 
Gray. Yet the mad worship of this actress did not  

342
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,000
make him annoyed or jealous. He was pleased by 
it. It made the boy more interesting to study.

343
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,280
Later that night, when he arrived home from 
dinner, Lord Henry saw a telegram on the table  

344
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:09,840
near the door. He opened it and read that 
Dorian Gray was going to marry Sibyl Vane.
 
 

345
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,040
CHAPTER FOUR

346
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,680
The Worship of Sibyl Vane

347
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,840
'I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?' 
said Lord Henry the following evening.  

348
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,800
They were in the dining-room of the Bristol Hotel.

349
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,920
'No, Harry,' answered the artist, giving his 
hat and coat to the waiter. 'What is it?'

350
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,240
'Dorian Gray is going to be married,' 
said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.

351
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,360
Hallward frowned. 'Dorian going to 
be married!' he cried. 'Impossible!'

352
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,520
'It is perfectly true.'

353
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,360
'To whom?'

354
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
'To some little actress.'

355
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
'But it would be absurd for him 
to marry someone like that.'

356
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:00,000
'If you want to make him marry this girl tell 
him that, Basil. He is sure to do it, then.  

357
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,840
Whenever a man does a completely stupid 
thing, it is always for a good reason.'

358
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
'I hope this girl is good, Harry.'

359
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,040
'Oh, she is better than good - she is 
beautiful,' said Lord Henry. 'Dorian says  

360
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,440
that she is beautiful and he is not often wrong 
about these things. Your portrait has helped him  

361
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,440
understand beauty in others. We are to see 
her tonight, if that boy doesn't forget.'

362
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,240
'But how can Dorian marry an actress, Harry?  

363
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,440
It is absurd,' cried the painter, walking 
up and down the room, biting his lip.

364
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,200
'Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful 
actress who plays Juliet. He asks her to marry  

365
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,320
him. Why not? I hope that Dorian Gray marries 
this girl and worships her for six months.  

366
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,880
Then he can suddenly become 
fascinated by another woman.'

367
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,440
'You don't mean a word of that, Harry! I 
know you don't really want Dorian Gray's  

368
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,120
life to be spoiled. You are much 
better than you pretend to be.'

369
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,440
Lord Henry laughed. 'The reason we all like 
to think so well of others is because we  

370
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,920
are afraid for ourselves. But here is Dorian 
himself. He will tell you more than I can.'

371
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,080
'My dear Harry, my dear Basil, 
you must both congratulate me!'  

372
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,160
said the boy, throwing off his coat 
and shaking each of his friends' hands.  

373
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,080
'I have never been so happy. Of course 
it is sudden - all the best things are.  

374
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,960
And yet it seems to me to be the one thing 
I have been looking for all my life.'

375
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,200
'I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,' 
said Hallward, 'but why did you not tell me?  

376
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,840
You told Harry.'

377
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,840
'There really is not much to tell,' cried Dorian. 
'Last night I went to see her again. After,  

378
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:12,080
when we were sitting together, there came into 
her eyes a wonderful look. It was something I had  

379
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:20,080
never seen there before. We kissed each other. I 
can't describe to you what I felt at that moment.'

380
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,480
'Have you seen her today?' asked Lord Henry.

381
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,840
Dorian Gray shook his head. 'I have 
left her in Shakespeare's forest.  

382
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,320
I will find her in his garden.'

383
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,840
'At what exact point did you 
use the word "marry", Dorian?  

384
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
And how did she answer? Perhaps 
you forgot all about it.'

385
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,280
'My dear Harry, it was not a business meeting.  

386
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,840
I told her I loved her. The whole world 
is nothing to me compared to her.'

387
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,280
'But my dear Dorian -'

388
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
Hallward put his hand on Lord Henry's arm.  

389
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,840
'Don't Harry. You have annoyed Dorian. He is 
not like other men. He would never harm anyone.'

390
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,960
Lord Henry looked across the table. 'Dorian 
is never annoyed with me,' he answered.

391
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,040
Dorian Gray laughed. 'When I am with Sibyl Vane 
I don't believe in anything you have taught me.  

392
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
I forget all your fascinating, terrible ideas.'

393
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,080
'And those are... ?' asked Lord 
Henry, helping himself to some salad.

394
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,160
'Oh, your ideas about life, your ideas about love, 
your ideas about pleasure. All your ideas, Harry.'

395
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,240
'Pleasure is the only thing worth having ideas 
about,' he answered, in his slow, musical voice.  

396
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,920
'When we are happy we are always good, but 
when we are good we are not always happy.'

397
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,840
'I know what pleasure is,' cried Dorian 
Gray. 'It is to worship someone.'

398
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,840
'That is certainly better than 
when someone worships you.'

399
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,680
'Harry, you are terrible! I don't 
know why I like you so much.  

400
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,920
Let us go down to the theatre. When you 
see Sibyl you will change your ideas.'

401
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,040
They got up and put on their coats. The painter 
was silent and thoughtful. He felt very sad.  

402
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,960
Dorian Gray would never again be to 
him all that he had been in the past.  

403
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
Life had come between them.

404
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,840
When he arrived at the theatre it seemed to 
Hallward that he had grown years older.
 
 

405
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,320
CHAPTER FIVE

406
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,480
Dorian Leaves Sibyl

407
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,320
The theatre was crowded that night. It was 
terribly hot and there were young people shouting  

408
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,320
to each other from across seats. Women were 
laughing loudly and their voices sounded horrible.  

409
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,080
People were eating oranges 
and drinking from bottles.

410
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,840
'What a place to find the perfect 
girl in!' said Lord Henry.

411
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,520
'Yes!' answered Dorian Gray. 'It was here 
I found her. When you see her as Juliet  

412
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,840
you will forget everything. These ugly people 
become quite different when she appears.'

413
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,760
'I understand what you mean, Dorian,' said 
the painter, 'and I believe in this girl.  

414
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,880
Anyone you love must be wonderful.'

415
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,480
'Thanks, Basil,' answered Dorian Gray. 
'I knew that you would understand me. In  

416
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,160
a few minutes you will see the girl 
who I am going to give my life to.  

417
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,760
The girl who I have given 
everything that is good in me.'

418
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,800
Then Sibyl appeared. The crowd 
shouted and called her name.  

419
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at, 
Lord Henry thought. Basil Hallward jumped  

420
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:12,560
to his feet excitedly. Dorian Gray sat 
staring at her like he was in a dream.

421
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,520
'Charming! Charming!' cried Lord Henry.

422
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
A quarter of an hour later, Lord 
Henry whispered to Hallward.  

423
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,960
'She's one of the loveliest girls I have 
ever seen. But she is a terrible actress.'

424
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,560
Dorian Gray's face turned white as he watched 
her speak. She was so different tonight! Now  

425
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,400
she was not Juliet but a very bad actress 
who did not understand Shakespeare's words.

426
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,320
Even the crowd became bored 
and began to talk loudly.  

427
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,920
The only person who did not seem 
to notice was the actress herself.

428
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,360
Lord Henry got up from his 
chair and put on his coat.  

429
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,080
'She is beautiful, Dorian,' he 
said, 'but she can't act. Let's go.'

430
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,960
'I am going to stay until the end,' 
answered the boy in a cold voice.  

431
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,360
'I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste 
an evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.'

432
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,880
'My dear Dorian, perhaps Miss Vane is ill,' 
said Hallward. 'We will come some other night.'

433
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,600
'Come to the club with Basil and 
myself. We will smoke cigarettes and  

434
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,600
drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She 
is beautiful. What more do you want?'

435
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,160
'Go away, Harry,' cried the boy. 'I want to 
be alone. Can't you see my heart is breaking?'  

436
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,240
Hot tears came to his eyes as Lord 
Henry and Hallward left the theatre.

437
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,400
When it was over, Dorian Gray 
rushed to see Sibyl Vane.  

438
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,960
The girl was standing there alone, with a 
look of extraordinary happiness on her face.

439
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,080
'How badly I acted tonight, Dorian!' she cried.

440
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,280
'Horribly!' he answered, staring 
at her. 'It was terrible.  

441
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,200
Are you ill? Why did you 
make me suffer like that?'

442
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,840
The girl smiled. 'Dorian, don't yon understand?'

443
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,800
'Understand what?' he asked, angrily.

444
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:40,400
'Why I was so bad tonight. Why I will always 
be bad. Why I will never act well again.'

445
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,760
'You are ill, I suppose. When 
you are ill, you shouldn't act.  

446
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,880
My friends were bored. I was bored.'

447
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,320
'Dorian, Dorian,' she cried, 'before I knew you, 
acting was the one important thing in my life.  

448
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:03,200
It was only in the theatre that I lived. 
I thought that it was all true. Tonight,  

449
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,760
for the first time in my life I saw that I 
was playing at love. Our love for each other  

450
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,000
is the only true love. Take me away with you, 
Dorian! I don't want to be an actress any more.'

451
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,000
He threw himself down on the 
sofa, and turned away his face.  

452
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,640
'You have killed my love,' he said quietly. 
Then he jumped up and went to the door. 'My God!  

453
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,200
How mad I was to love you! What a fool I 
have been! You are nothing to me now. I  

454
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,080
will never see you again. I will never think 
of you. I will never speak to you again.'

455
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,920
The girl went white. 'You are not serious, Dorian?  

456
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,320
You are acting?' she whispered, 
putting her hand on his arm.

457
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,240
He pushed her back. 'Don't touch me!' he 
cried. Then he turned and left the room.

458
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,480
After walking the streets of London all night, 
he arrived home just after sunrise. As he passed  

459
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,560
through the library, he saw the portrait that 
Basil Hallward had painted of him. He stared at  

460
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,520
it in surprise and walked on into his bedroom. 
He took his coat off and stood next to his bed.  

461
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,280
A few moments later he returned to the picture 
and looked at it closely. In the poor light the  

462
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:39,360
face seemed to have changed a little. Now the 
mouth looked cruel. It was certainly strange.

463
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,920
He walked to the window and opened the 
curtains. The light changed the room,  

464
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,280
but the face stayed the same. In fact, the 
sunlight made the mouth look even crueller.

465
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Going back to his bedroom, he found a 
small mirror that had been a present  

466
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:07,920
from Lord Henry. He looked at his real face 
and saw no sign of cruelty. What did it mean?

467
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,160
He threw himself into a chair, and began 
to think. Suddenly he remembered what  

468
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,160
he had said in Basil Hallward's house 
the day the picture had been finished.  

469
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,880
Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had asked that 
the painting grow old so that he himself could  

470
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,680
remain young. But such things were impossible. 
It was terrible even to think about them.  

471
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,440
And, yet, there was the picture in front 
of him. There was the cruelty in the mouth.

472
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:53,680
Cruelty! Had he been cruel? No, why think 
about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.

473
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,640
But the picture? What was he to say of that?  

474
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,920
It held the secret of his life, and told his 
story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.

475
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:13,840
Would it teach him to hate his own 
soul? Would he ever look at it again?

476
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,600
He would save himself! He would not see Lord Henry 
again. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, marry her  

477
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:29,760
and try to love her again. She had suffered more 
than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and  

478
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,920
cruel to her. They would be happy together. 
His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

479
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
He got up from his chair, 
and covered the portrait.  

480
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,880
'How horrible!' he said to himself, and he 
walked across to the window and opened it.  

481
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,680
When he stepped out on to the grass he 
took a deep breath. He thought only of  

482
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,040
Sibyl. The birds that were singing in the garden 
seemed to be telling the flowers about her.
 
 

483
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,800
CHAPTER SIX

484
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,680
Love Becomes Tragedy

485
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,640
It was nearly one o'clock the 
next afternoon when he woke up.  

486
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,360
His servant brought him a cup of tea and some 
letters. One of them was from Lord Henry,  

487
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,760
and had been brought by hand that 
morning. He put it to one side.

488
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,040
He went into the library for 
breakfast feeling perfectly happy.  

489
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,360
Then he saw the open window 
and the covered portrait.  

490
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:40,800
Was it all true? Or had it just been a dream? 
But he remembered that cruel mouth so clearly.

491
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,160
Dorian Gray sent his servant away and locked 
all the doors. Then he pulled the cover off the  

492
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:56,240
painting, and saw himself face to face. 
It was true. The portrait had changed.

493
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,880
For hours he did not know what to do or think.  

494
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,080
Finally, he went over to the table and 
wrote a passionate letter to the girl  

495
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,280
he had loved. He asked her to forgive him 
for the terrible things he had said to her.

496
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:21,600
Suddenly he heard a knock on the door, and he 
heard Lord Henry's voice outside. 'My dear boy,  

497
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,400
I must see you. Let me in at once.'

498
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:34,160
He made no answer, but remained quite still. 
The knocking continued and grew louder.  

499
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,400
Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in. He would 
explain to him the new life he was going to lead.  

500
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,360
He jumped up, covered the 
picture and opened the door.

501
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,440
'I am sorry about it all, Dorian,' 
said Lord Henry, as he entered.  

502
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
'But you must not think too much about it.'

503
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,640
'Do you mean about Sibyl Vine?' asked the boy.

504
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:06,080
'Yes, of course,' answered Lord Henry, sitting 
down and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves. 'It  

505
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:13,040
is terrible, but you are not to blame. Tell me, 
did you go behind and see her after it was over?'

506
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,920
'Yes.'

507
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,840
'I felt sure that you had. 
Did you have an argument?'

508
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:28,320
'I was cruel, Harry - terribly cruel. But 
it is all right now. I am not sorry for  

509
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,480
anything that has happened. It has 
taught me to know myself better.'

510
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,280
'Oh, Dorian, I am so glad 
that you see it that way.'

511
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:45,840
'I want to be good, Harry. I don't want my soul 
to be ugly. I am going to marry Sibyl Vine.'

512
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,920
'Marry Sibyl Vine!' cried Lord Henry, 
standing up, and staring at him in surprise.  

513
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,360
'But, my dear Dorian -'

514
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,960
'Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to 
say. Something horrible about getting married.  

515
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,480
Don't say it! Sibyl will be my wife!'

516
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:12,240
'Your wife! Dorian!... Didn't you get 
my letter? I wrote to you this morning.'

517
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,160
'Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. 
I have not read it yet, Harry.'

518
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,040
'You know nothing yet then?'

519
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,920
'What do you mean?'

520
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,480
Lord Henry walked across the room 
and sat down next to Dorian Gray.  

521
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,800
Taking both his hands in his own, he held them.  

522
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,640
'Dorian,' he said, 'my letter was to 
tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.'

523
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,520
A cry of pain came from the boy's 
lips and he jumped to his feet. 'Dead!  

524
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,280
Sibyl dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie!'

525
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,520
'It is true, Dorian,' said Lord Henry. 
'It is in all the morning newspapers.  

526
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,480
The police will be asking questions, and you 
must keep your name out of any scandal. Things  

527
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,320
like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But 
in London they are a disaster for any gentleman.  

528
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,920
I suppose they don't know 
your name at the theatre?  

529
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,200
If they don't, it is all right. Did 
anyone see you going round to her room?'

530
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,720
Dorian did not answer for a few moments. 
Finally he said in a strange voice,  

531
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,960
'Harry, did you say that the police are 
asking questions? What did you mean by that?  

532
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,800
Did Sibyl -? Oh, Harry this is terrible!'

533
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,920
'I am sure that it was not an accident, though 
it must be described that way officially.  

534
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,760
She swallowed something 
horrible they use at theatres.'

535
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,240
'Harry, Harry, it is terrible!' cried the boy.

536
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,160
'Yes, it is very sad, of course, 
but it is nothing to do with you.  

537
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,080
Come with me to dinner, and 
after we will go to the theatre.'

538
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:22,240
'So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,' said Dorian 
Gray, half to himself. 'Yet the roses are not less  

539
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:30,480
lovely. The birds still sing happily in my garden. 
And tonight I will have dinner with you and go to  

540
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:42,000
the theatre. How extraordinary life is! My first 
passionate love letter was to a dead girl. Yet why  

541
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,440
is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as 
I want to? I don't think I am heartless. Do you?'

542
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,680
'You have done too many foolish things in 
the last fortnight to be heartless, Dorian,'  

543
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,840
answered Lord Henry, with his sweet, sad smile.

544
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,720
The boy frowned. 'I don't like that explanation,  

545
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,440
Harry,' he said, 'but I am glad 
you don't think I am heartless.'

546
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:20,320
'A woman has killed herself for the love of 
you,' said Lord Henry. 'That is very beautiful.'

547
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,440
They were silent. The evening darkened in the 
room. After some time Dorian Gray looked up.  

548
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,800
'How well you know me! But we will 
not talk again of what has happened.  

549
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,160
It has been something wonderful. 
That is all. Now, I have to dress,  

550
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:56,000
Harry. I feel too tired to eat anything, 
but I will join you later at the theatre.'

551
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,200
As Lord Henry closed the door behind him Dorian 
rushed to the portrait and tore off the cover. No,  

552
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,160
there was no further change in the picture.  

553
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,320
It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's 
death before he had known of it himself.  

554
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,400
Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her. He 
brushed them away and looked again at the picture.

555
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,760
He felt the time had come to 
choose. Or had he already chosen?  

556
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:37,840
Yes, life had decided that for him. The portrait 
was going to carry his shame: that was all.

557
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,720
An hour later he was at the theatre, 
and Lord Henry was sitting beside him.
 
 

558
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,240
CHAPTER SEVEN

559
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,600
'What Is Past Is Past?'

560
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,600
As he was eating breakfast the next morning, 
Basil Hallward was shown into the room.

561
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,280
I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,' he 
said. 'I called last night, and they told me  

562
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,280
that you were at the theatre. Of course I knew 
that was impossible. I had a terrible evening  

563
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,360
worrying whether one tragedy would be followed 
by another. I can't tell you how heart-broken I  

564
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:27,760
am about the whole thing. Did you go and see the 
girl's mother? What did she say about it all?'

565
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:38,000
'My dear Basil, I don't know,' said Dorian Gray. 
He looked very bored. 'I was at the theatre.'

566
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,280
'You went to the theatre?' said 
Hallward, speaking very slowly.  

567
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,320
'You went to the theatre where 
Sibyl Vane was lying dead?'

568
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,520
'Stop, Basil! I won't hear it!' cried 
Dorian, jumping to his feet. 'You must  

569
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,800
not speak of such things. What is 
done is done. What is past is past.'

570
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,760
'You call yesterday the past? Dorian, this is 
horrible! Something has changed you completely.  

571
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,560
You look exactly the same as the wonderful boy 
in my picture, but now there is no heart in you.  

572
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,800
It is all Harry's influence. I see that.'

573
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,840
The boy went to the window and looked 
out at the garden for a few moments.

574
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,160
'Harry has taught me many 
things, Basil.' he said at last.  

575
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,840
'You have only taught me to love my own beauty.'

576
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,600
'I am truly sorry for that, Dorian.'

577
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,720
I don't know what you mean, 
Basil,' he said, turning round.  

578
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,680
'I don't know what you want. What do you want?'

579
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,560
'I want the Dorian Gray I used 
to paint,' said the artist sadly.

580
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,240
'Basil,' said the boy, going over to him 
and putting his hand on his shoulder,  

581
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,240
'you have come too late. Yesterday when I 
heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself-'

582
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,200
'Killed herself! My God! Is there no 
doubt about that?' cried Hallward.

583
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,560
'My dear Basil! Of course she killed herself.'

584
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:29,680
The older man put his face in his hands. 
'How terrible,' he said in a quiet voice.

585
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,800
'No,' said Dorian Gray, 'there is nothing 
terrible about it. It is one of the great  

586
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:42,560
romantic tragedies of our time. I know you 
are surprised at me talking to you like this.  

587
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,560
You have not realized how I have changed. I 
was a boy when you knew me. I am a man now.  

588
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,000
I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas -'

589
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,520
'But Dorian -'

590
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,200
'I am different, but you must not like me less.  

591
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,640
Of course I am very fond of Harry. But 
I know that you are better than he is.  

592
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:14,240
You are not stronger - you are too afraid of 
life - but you are better. And how happy we  

593
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,840
used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, 
and don't argue with me. I am what I am.'

594
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,840
The painter felt strangely sad. Dorian 
Gray was extraordinarily important to him.  

595
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:37,120
The boy had changed his art. Perhaps his 
cruel talk about Sibyl Vane was just a mood  

596
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,360
that would pass away. There was 
so much in him that was good.

597
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,840
'Well, Dorian,' he said with a sad smile, 'I won't 
speak to you again about this horrible thing.  

598
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,960
I only hope that your name is kept out of any 
scandal. Have the police asked to see you?'

599
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,840
Dorian shook his head. 'They don't 
even know my name,' he answered.

600
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,640
'She didn't know your name?'

601
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,440
'Only my first name, and I am sure that she 
did not tell it to anyone. She told her family  

602
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:20,480
that I was Prince Charming. It was pretty of 
her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil.  

603
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,400
I would like to have something more of 
her than the memory of a few kisses.'

604
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,920
'I will try and do something,  

605
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,760
Dorian. But you must come and sit for me 
again. I can't work so well without you.'

606
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,760
'I can never sit for you again, 
Basil. It is impossible!' he cried.

607
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:48,800
'My dear boy, what is this foolishness!' Hallward 
cried. 'Did you not like what I did for you? Where  

608
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:56,240
is it? Why have you covered it? Let me look at it. 
It is the best thing I have ever done. It is very  

609
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,000
bad of your servant to hide my work like that. 
I felt the room looked different as I came in.'

610
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,600
'It was not my servant who covered 
it, Basil. I did it myself.  

611
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
The light was too strong on the portrait.'

612
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,080
'Too strong! No, the light is 
perfect in here. Let me see it.'  

613
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,120
And Hallward walked towards 
the corner of the room.

614
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,680
A terrible cry came from Dorian Gray's 
lips, and he rushed between the painter  

615
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,640
and the covered portrait. 'Basil, you 
must not look at it! I don't want you to.'

616
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:38,480
'Not look at my own work! Are you serious? Why 
shouldn't I look at it?' cried Hallward, laughing.

617
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,920
'If you try and look at it, Basil, I promise I 
will never speak to you again. I am very serious.'

618
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,040
Hallward looked at Dorian Gray in surprise. 
He had never seen him like this before.  

619
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,840
The boy's face was white and angry.

620
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,680
'Dorian!'

621
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,200
'Don't speak!'

622
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,720
'But what is the matter? Of course I won't look 
at it if you don't want me to,' he said coldly,  

623
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,160
walking over to the window. 'But it seems 
rather absurd that I cannot see my own work  

624
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,520
when I am going to exhibit 
it in Paris in the autumn.'

625
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,040
'To exhibit it? You want to 
exhibit it?' cried Dorian Gray.  

626
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,800
A terrible fear was building inside 
him. Was the world going to see his  

627
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,720
secret? Were people going to stare at the 
mystery of his life? That was impossible.

628
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,560
'Yes, George Petit is going to exhibit 
all my best pictures in October.  

629
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,360
Don't worry, it is only for one month.'

630
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,760
Dorian Gray passed his hand across his face.  

631
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:55,200
It felt hot and wet. He felt that he was about 
to face horrible danger. 'You told me a month ago  

632
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:02,240
that you would never exhibit it,' he cried. 'Why 
have you changed your mind?' He stopped suddenly  

633
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,880
and a cruel look came into his eyes. He had 
remembered something Lord Henry had said to him,  

634
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,200
'Ask Basil why he won't exhibit your picture. 
He told me once and it is a very strange story.'  

635
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,960
Yes, perhaps Basil too had his 
secret. He would ask him and try.

636
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,680
'Basil,' he said, coming over quite close, 
and looking him straight in the face.  

637
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:38,400
'We all have secrets. What was your reason 
for not wanting to exhibit my picture?'

638
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:45,840
'Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less 
than you do now. And you would certainly laugh  

639
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:51,840
at me. If you don't want me ever to look 
at your picture again, I won't. I have  

640
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,960
always you to look at. Your friendship is more 
important to me than exhibiting a painting.'

641
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:05,600
'No, Basil, you must tell me,' said Dorian 
Gray. His feeling of fear had passed away.  

642
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,760
Now he just wanted to find 
out Basil Hallward's mystery.

643
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,400
'Dorian,' said the painter, 
who did not look happy.  

644
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,760
'Have you ever noticed something 
in the picture, something strange?'

645
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,040
'Basil!' cried the boy, 
staring at him with wild eyes.

646
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,880
'I see you did. Dorian, from the moment I met you,  

647
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,160
your personality had the most 
extraordinary influence over me.  

648
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,440
I worshipped you. I was jealous of everyone you 
spoke to. I wanted to have you all to myself.  

649
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,480
I was only happy when I was with you. When you 
were away from me you were still there in my art.'

650
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,800
'Basil -'

651
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:58,400
'No, don't speak. I must tell you now what 
I did not tell you then. That I decided to  

652
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,680
paint a wonderful portrait of you. I put 
all my feelings for you into that picture.  

653
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:10,320
I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much. 
I had put too much of myself into it.  

654
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,560
So I decided never to exhibit the 
portrait. I told Harry and he laughed.  

655
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,240
When the picture was finished, and I sat 
alone with it, I felt that I was right...  

656
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,480
Later, I thought that perhaps I was being 
foolish and when this Paris offer came...  

657
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,600
but I see now that the picture cannot be shown.'

658
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:43,680
Dorian Gray breathed deeply. The colour came 
back to his cheeks and a smile crossed his lips.  

659
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,320
The danger was over and he was safe for a while.  

660
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:57,200
What a sad story Basil had told. Would he ever 
be so influenced by the personality of a friend?  

661
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,360
Lord Henry had the charm of being 
very dangerous. But that was all.

662
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,200
'It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,' said 
Hallward, 'that you saw this in the portrait.'

663
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:21,840
T saw something in it,' he answered, 
'something that seemed to me very strange.'

664
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,680
'Well, you don't mind me 
looking at the thing now?'

665
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,360
Dorian shook his head. 'You 
must not ask me that, Basil.  

666
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,080
I cannot let you stand in front of that picture.'

667
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,440
'You will one day, won't you?'

668
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:38,880
'Never.'

669
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,200
'Well, perhaps you are right.  

670
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:50,560
And now goodbye, Dorian. You have been the one 
person in my life who has really influenced my  

671
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,360
art. But you don't know what it cost me 
to tell you all that I have told you.'

672
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,760
'My dear Basil,' said Dorian,  

673
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:06,640
'what have you told me? Only that you worshipped 
me too much. That is not even flattery.'

674
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,400
'It was not meant as flattery. 
And now that I have told you,  

675
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,040
something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps 
you should never put what you worship into words.'

676
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,760
'You mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish.  

677
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,400
You and I are friends, Basil, 
and we will always be friends.'

678
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,960
'You have got Harry.' said the painter, sadly.

679
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:40,800
'Oh, Harry!' laughed the young man. 'Harry spends 
his life saying and doing extraordinary things.  

680
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,520
He lives the sort of life I want 
to live. But I don't think I would  

681
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,080
go to Harry if I was in trouble. I 
would prefer to go to you, Basil.'

682
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,520
'You will sit for me again?'

683
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,840
'Impossible! There is something terrible 
about a portrait. It has a life of its own.  

684
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,960
I will come and have tea with you instead.'

685
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,240
'Well, goodbye then. I am sorry that you 
won't let me look at the picture again.  

686
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,840
But I understand what you feel about it.'

687
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:23,680
As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to 
himself. Poor Basil! How little he knew of  

688
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:29,760
the true reason. And now he understood more 
the painter's wild and jealous feelings,  

689
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,600
and he felt sorry. There was something tragic 
in a friendship so corrupted by passion.

690
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,840
He rang the bell to call his servant. 
He had to hide the portrait immediately.  

691
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,840
It had been mad of him to leave it in a place 
where it could be discovered by his friends.
 
 

692
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,560
CHAPTER EIGHT

693
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,560
The Portrait Is Hidden

694
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,280
When the servant entered, Dorian Gray asked 
him to send Mrs Leaf to him in the library.  

695
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:06,000
Mrs Leaf had been with his family for many years. 
He asked her for the key to the old schoolroom.

696
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:13,520
'The old schoolroom, Mr Dorian?' she cried. 
'But it is full of dust! I must clean it first.'

697
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,240
'I don't want it cleaned, Mrs 
Leaf. I only want the key.'

698
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,400
'Well, sir, you'll be covered 
with dust if you go into it.  

699
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,680
It hasn't been open for nearly five 
years, not since your grandfather died.'

700
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,000
He frowned at this reminder of his grandfather. 
He had bad memories of all his family.  

701
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,960
'That does not matter,' he answered. 'I just want 
to see the place - that is all. Give me the key.'

702
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,920
'Here is the key, sir,' said the old lady. 'But 
you are not going to live up there, are you, sir?'

703
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,360
'No, no,' he cried. 'Thank 
you, Mrs Leaf. You can go.'

704
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,240
An hour later two men 
arrived to move the portrait.

705
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,840
'It's very heavy, sir,' said one of 
the men, as they climbed the stairs.

706
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:09,360
'I am afraid it is rather heavy,' 
said Dorian, as he opened the door  

707
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,520
of the old schoolroom where he was going 
to hide the secret of his corrupted soul.

708
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:20,800
He had not entered the room since he was a child. 
It was a large room built by his grandfather to  

709
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:27,040
keep him at a distance. Every moment of his lonely 
childhood came back to him as he looked round.

710
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,320
It was a room full of terrible 
memories, but it was safe.  

711
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:39,040
He had the key, and no other person could enter 
it. The face in the portrait could grow old and  

712
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,920
ugly. What did it matter? No one could see 
it. He himself would not see it. He did not  

713
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:52,080
have to watch the terrible corruption of his 
soul. He would stay young - that was enough.

714
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,640
When the men had gone, Dorian locked the door, 
and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now.  

715
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,720
No one would ever look at that horrible 
thing. Only he would ever see his shame.

716
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:14,560
He went back to the library and found a note 
from Lord Henry. In it was a report from the  

717
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,400
newspaper about Sibyl Vane. Her death 
was officially described as an accident.

718
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,920
He frowned, and tore the paper in two. Then he 
walked across the room and threw the pieces away.  

719
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:34,000
How ugly it all was! And how 
horribly real ugliness made things!

720
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,920
Perhaps the servant had read the report, 
and had begun to suspect something.  

721
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,200
And, yet, what did it matter? What had 
Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?  

722
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,720
There was nothing to be afraid of. 
Dorian Gray had not killed her.
 
 

723
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,440
CHAPTER NINE

724
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,920
'I Will Show You my Soul'

725
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,000
Many years passed. Yet the wonderful beauty 
that had so fascinated Basil Hallward,  

726
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,160
stayed with Dorian Gray. Even those who had heard 
terrible rumours against him, could not believe  

727
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:17,280
them when they met him. He always had the 
look of someone who had kept himself pure.

728
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,120
Many people suspected that there was 
something very wrong with Dorian's life,  

729
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,760
but only he knew about the portrait. Some 
nights he would secretly enter the locked room.  

730
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,680
Holding a mirror in his hand, he would stand in 
front of the picture Basil Hallward had painted.  

731
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,840
He would look first at the 
horrible, old face in the picture,  

732
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:47,680
and then at the handsome young face that laughed 
back at him from the mirror. He fell more and more  

733
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:53,840
in love with his own beauty. And more and more 
interested in the corruption of his own soul.

734
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
Then something happened that changed everything.

735
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,880
It was on the ninth of November, the 
day before his thirty-eighth birthday.  

736
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,280
He was walking home from Lord Henry's and the 
night was cold and foggy. At the corner of  

737
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:15,840
Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man 
passed him in the fog. He was walking very fast,  

738
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:23,280
and had the collar of his coat turned up. He had 
a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized him. It was  

739
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:29,680
Basil Hallward. A strange fear made Dorian walk 
off quickly in the direction of his own house.

740
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,040
But Hallward had seen him. Dorian 
heard him hurrying after him.  

741
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,000
In a few moments his hand was on his arm.

742
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,960
'Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck!  

743
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,000
I have been waiting for you in your 
library ever since nine o'clock.  

744
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:52,560
I am going to Paris on the midnight train, and I 
wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was  

745
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:59,040
you, or at least your coat, as I passed you. 
But I wasn't sure. Didn't you recognize me?'

746
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,800
'In this fog, my dear Basil? I can't 
even recognize Grosvenor Square.  

747
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:11,264
I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I 
don't feel at all certain about it. I am sorry you  

748
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:18,160
are going away, as I have not seen you for such a 
long time. But I suppose you will be back soon?'

749
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,600
'No, I am going to be out 
of England for six months.  

750
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,920
Here we are at your door. Let me come in for 
a moment. I have something to say to you.'

751
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,840
'That would be lovely. But won't you 
miss your train?' said Dorian Gray,  

752
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,560
as he went up the steps and 
opened the door with his key.

753
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,600
'I have plenty of time,' he 
answered. 'The train doesn't go  

754
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,320
until twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.  

755
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,680
All I have with me is this bag, and I can easily 
get to Victoria Station in twenty minutes.'

756
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,880
Dorian looked at him and smiled. 'Come 
in or the fog will get into my house.'

757
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,080
Hallward followed Dorian into the library. There 
was a bright wood fire on one side of the room  

758
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,440
and two lamps on the other.

759
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,360
'Would you like a drink?'asked Dorian.

760
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,280
'No thanks, I won't have anything more,' said 
the painter, taking his hat and coat off.  

761
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,720
'And now, my dear Dorian, I 
want to speak to you seriously.  

762
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,560
Don't frown like that. You make it 
so much more difficult for me.''

763
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,160
'What is it all about?' cried Dorian, throwing 
himself down on the sofa. 'I hope it is not  

764
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:37,200
about myself. I am tired of myself tonight. 
I would prefer to be somebody different.'

765
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:44,560
'It is about yourself,' answered Hallward, in 
his deep voice, 'and I must say it to you.'

766
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:52,000
Dorian breathed deeply and lit a 
cigarette. 'Is it really necessary, Basil?'

767
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,880
'I think you should know some of the terrible 
things that people are saying about you.'

768
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,800
'I don't want to know anything about 
them. I love scandals about other people,  

769
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,600
but scandals about myself don't interest me.'

770
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,320
'Every gentleman is interested 
in his good name, Dorian.  

771
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,160
You don't want people to talk of you 
as something terrible and corrupt.  

772
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,600
But I don't believe these rumours at all. At 
least I can't believe them when I see you.  

773
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,560
Corruption is a thing that writes itself 
across a man's face. It cannot be hidden.'

774
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,760
'My dear Basil -'

775
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:35,440
'And yet, I rarely see you now and you never come 
to my house. When I hear all the terrible things  

776
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:42,000
people are whispering about you, I don't know what 
to say. Why have so many of your friends killed  

777
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,080
themselves? Young men from good families like 
Adrian Singleton and that poor young soldier?'

778
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:54,160
'Stop, Basil. You are talking about things 
of which you know nothing,' said Dorian.  

779
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,360
'I know how people talk in England. This is 
a country where people have two faces. They  

780
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:06,320
whisper rumours about people like myself, and then 
do much worse things when others are not looking.'

781
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,960
'Dorian,' cried Hallward, 'that is not the 
question. I know England is bad, but that's  

782
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,320
the reason I want you to be a good influence on 
your friends. Instead you have lost all belief  

783
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:23,920
in goodness and honesty. You have filled those 
poor young men with a madness for pleasure.'

784
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,320
Dorian smiled.

785
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:34,720
'How can you smile like that? I only want you to 
have a clean name. You have a wonderful influence.  

786
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:41,440
Let it be for good. Yet I wonder whether I 
know you? But I can't answer that question.  

787
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,760
I would need to see your soul.'

788
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,920
'To see my soul!' cried Dorian Gray. He jumped 
up from the sofa, turning almost white with fear.

789
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,920
'Yes,' answered Hallward. There 
was a deep sadness in his voice.  

790
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,560
'To see your soul. But only God can do that.'

791
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,960
A bitter laugh came from 
the lips of the younger man.  

792
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,880
'You will see it yourself, tonight!' he 
cried, picking up a lamp from the table.  

793
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:20,400
'Come, it is your own work. Why shouldn't you look 
at it? You can tell the world all about it after,  

794
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:26,000
if you want. Nobody will believe you. If they 
do believe you, they will like me better for it.  

795
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,640
Come, I tell you. You have talked enough about 
corruption. Now you will see it face to face.'

796
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,040
There was madness in every word he said. 
He felt a terrible delight that someone was  

797
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,000
going to share his secret. The man who had 
painted the portrait was going to share his  

798
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,120
shame. The painter would suffer for the rest of 
his life with the memory of what he had done.

799
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,320
'Yes,' he continued, coming closer to him.  

800
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,120
'I will show you my soul. You will 
see what you think only God can see.'

801
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:01,760
Hallward jumped back.

802
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,680
'You cannot say things like 
that, Dorian!' he cried.  

803
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,840
'They are horrible and they don't mean anything.'

804
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,680
'You think so?' He laughed again.

805
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,960
'I know so. Dorian, you have to tell me -'

806
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,160
'Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say.'

807
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:26,320
The painter felt extraordinarily sad. He 
walked over to the fire and stood there.

808
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,960
'I am waiting, Basil,' said the 
young man, in a hard, clear voice.

809
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:40,640
He turned round. 'What I have to say is this,' 
he cried. 'You must give me some answer to the  

810
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,960
horrible things people are saying against you. 
Tell me that they are not true, Dorian! Can't you  

811
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:54,320
see what I am going through? My God! Don't tell 
me that you are bad and corrupt and shameful.'

812
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Dorian Gray smiled. 'Come 
upstairs, Basil,' he said, quietly.  

813
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,160
'I keep a diary of my life from day to day. I 
will show it to you if you come up with me.'

814
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,240
'I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.  

815
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,960
I see I have missed my train. It 
does not matter. I can go tomorrow.  

816
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,280
But don't ask me to read anything tonight. 
All I want is a simple answer to my question.'

817
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,200
'I will give it to you upstairs. 
I could not give it to you here.  

818
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:35,840
You will not have to read for long.'
 
 

819
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,520
CHAPTER TEN

820
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,840
Basil Sees the Portrait

821
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:47,520
He passed out of the room and began climbing the 
stairs. Basil Hallward followed close behind. They  

822
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:53,600
walked softly, as people always do at night. The 
lamp made strange shadows on the wall and stairs.

823
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,480
When they reached the top, Dorian 
put the lamp down on the floor.  

824
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,960
He took the key out of his 
pocket and turned it in the lock.

825
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,640
'You really want to know, 
Basil?' he asked in a low voice.

826
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,480
'Yes.'

827
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:16,640
'I am delighted,' he answered, smiling. Then 
he added, 'You are the one man in the world I  

828
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,680
want to know everything about me. You have 
influenced my life more than you think.'  

829
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:28,160
Taking up the lamp, he opened the door 
and went in. Cold air passed between them.  

830
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,000
'Shut the door behind you,' he whispered, 
as he placed the lamp on the table.

831
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,840
Hallward looked around the room in surprise. The 
room had clearly not been lived in for years. The  

832
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,360
whole place was covered with dust, and there were 
holes in the carpet. A mouse ran across the floor.

833
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,080
'So you think that it is only 
God who sees the soul, Basil.  

834
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,840
Take the cover off the portrait, 
and you will see mine.'

835
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,360
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.

836
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,840
'You are mad, Dorian,' said Hallward, frowning.

837
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,960
'You won't take the cover off? Then I 
will do it myself,' said the young man,  

838
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,120
throwing the old purple curtain to the ground.

839
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,680
A cry of fear came from the painter's 
lips when he saw the face in the portrait.  

840
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:27,360
It was Dorian Gray's face he was looking at, and 
it still had some of that wonderful beauty. But  

841
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,280
now there were terrible signs of age and 
corruption. But who had done it? He held  

842
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:38,160
the lamp up to the picture. In the left 
hand corner was his name, painted in red.

843
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,840
What had happened? He had never done that.  

844
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:50,880
Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and it 
made his blood turn to ice. His own picture! What  

845
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:58,560
did it mean? Why had it changed? He turned, and 
looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.

846
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,440
The young man was standing 
near the wall, watching him.  

847
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,880
He had taken the flower out of 
his coat, and was smelling it.

848
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,920
'What does this mean?' cried Hallward, at 
last. His own voice sounded high and strange.

849
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,960
'Years ago, when I was a boy,' said Dorian Gray, 
closing his hand on the flower, 'you met me and  

850
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:29,200
flattered me. You taught me to love my beauty. 
One day you introduced me to a friend of yours.  

851
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,080
He explained to me how wonderful it was 
to be young. You finished a portrait of  

852
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:40,800
me that showed me how wonderful it was to be 
beautiful. In a mad moment I made a wish -'

853
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,360
'I remember it! Oh, how well I remember 
it! No! The thing is impossible.  

854
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,840
There must be something wrong with the 
paint. I tell you the thing is impossible.'

855
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:58,000
'Is anything really impossible?' said 
the young man, going over to the window.

856
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,440
'You told me you had destroyed it.'

857
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,840
'I was wrong. It has destroyed me.'

858
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,760
'I don't believe it is my picture. There 
was nothing bad in it, nothing shameful.  

859
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,160
You were perfect to me. This is a face from hell.'

860
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:24,240
'It is the face of my soul. Each of us has Heaven 
and Hell in him, Basil,' cried Dorian wildly.

861
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:31,920
Hallward turned again to the portrait, and 
stared at it. 'My God! Is this true?' he cried.  

862
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,680
'Is this what you have done with your life? 
You must be even worse than people say!'

863
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,760
Hallward threw himself into the chair by 
the table and put his face in his hands.  

864
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,240
The lamp fell to the floor and went out.

865
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:57,200
'Good God, Dorian! What an awful lesson! What 
an awful lesson!' There was no answer, but he  

866
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:05,040
could hear the young man crying at the window. 'We 
must ask God for forgiveness. I worshipped you too  

867
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:12,240
much. I am punished for it. You worshipped 
yourself too much. We are both punished.'

868
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:19,680
Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked 
at him. There were tears in his eyes.  

869
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,160
'It is too late, Basil,' he said.

870
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,840
'But don't you see that 
hellish thing staring at us?'

871
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:38,000
Dorian Gray looked at the picture. Suddenly 
he felt that he hated Basil Hallward. He  

872
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,840
hated the man sitting at the table more 
than he hated anything in his life.

873
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:49,040
He looked wildly around. Something shone on top 
of the painted cupboard that faced him. It was a  

874
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:55,280
knife he had left there some days before. He moved 
slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.  

875
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:00,560
He took the knife in his hand and turned 
around. Hallward moved in his chair.  

876
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,040
He rushed at him, and stuck the 
knife into his neck again and again.

877
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:12,000
He threw the knife down on 
the table and stood back.  

878
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,400
He could hear nothing but the sound 
of blood falling on to the carpet.  

879
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:26,560
He opened the door and went out on to the stairs. 
The house was completely quiet. No one was there.

880
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:35,120
How quickly it had all been done! Feeling 
strangely calm, he walked over to the window  

881
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:40,720
and opened it. The wind had blown the fog 
away and the sky was clear. He looked down  

882
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:45,120
and saw a policeman walking down the street. 
He was shining a lamp in all the houses.

883
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:51,040
Closing the window, he went back into the 
room. He did not look at the murdered man.  

884
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,360
He felt that the secret of the whole 
thing was not to think about it at all.  

885
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:01,120
The friend who had painted the terrible portrait 
had gone out of his life. That was enough.

886
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,560
He picked up the lamp and walked out of 
the room, locking the door behind him.  

887
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,840
As he walked down the stairs he thought that 
he heard what sounded like cries of pain.  

888
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:18,880
He stopped several times, and 
waited. No, everything was still.

889
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,720
When he reached the library, he 
saw the bag and coat in the corner.  

890
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,240
They must be hidden away somewhere. He 
unlocked a secret cupboard and threw them in.  

891
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,880
He could easily burn them later. Then he pulled 
out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.

892
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:43,360
He sat down and began to think. Basil 
Hallward had left the house at eleven.  

893
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:52,560
No one had seen him come in again. The servants 
were in bed… Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that  

894
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,240
Basil had gone. And by the midnight train as he 
had planned. It would be months before anyone  

895
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:03,840
suspected anything. Months! He could 
destroy everything long before then.

896
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:11,680
Suddenly he had a thought. He put on his coat 
and hat and went into the front room. From the  

897
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:17,840
window he could see the policeman passing 
the house. He waited, and held his breath.

898
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,040
After a few moments he went out of the house, 
shutting the door very gently behind him.  

899
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,560
Then he began ringing the bell. In 
about five minutes a servant appeared.  

900
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,840
He was half dressed and looked very sleepy.

901
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,120
'I am sorry I had to wake you up, 
Francis,' he said, stepping in.  

902
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,040
'But I have forgotten my key. What time is it?'

903
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,320
'Ten minutes past two, sir,' 
answered the man, looking at a clock.

904
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:53,760
'Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must 
wake me at nine tomorrow. I have some work to do.'

905
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,760
'All right, sir.'

906
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,720
'Did anyone call this evening?'

907
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:04,560
'Mr Hallward, sir. He stayed here until eleven, 
and then he went away to catch his train.'

908
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,440
'Oh! I am sorry I didn't see 
him. Did he leave any message?'

909
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,840
'No, sir. He said he would 
write to you from Paris.'

910
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:18,080
'That is all, Francis. Don't forget 
to call me at nine tomorrow.'

911
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:19,920
'No, sir.'

912
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,720
The man went off to his bedroom.

913
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,120
Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon 
the table and passed into the library.  

914
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,920
For a quarter of an hour he walked up and 
down the room, biting his lip and thinking.  

915
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,400
Then he took down a book from one of the 
cupboards, and began to turn the pages.  

916
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:49,280
'Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, 
Mayfair.' Yes, that was the man he wanted.
 
 

917
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,840
CHAPTER ELEVEN

918
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,280
The Problem of the Body

919
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,120
At nine o'clock the next morning his 
servant came in with a cup of chocolate,  

920
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:07,680
and opened the curtains. Dorian was sleeping quite 
peacefully, lying with one hand under his cheek.

921
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,240
As he opened his eyes a 
smile passed across his lips.  

922
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,240
He turned round, and began to drink his chocolate.  

923
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,760
The November sun came into the room, and the sky 
was bright. It was almost like a morning in May.

924
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,920
Slowly he remembered what had 
happened the night before.  

925
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,480
The dead man was still sitting 
there, and in the sunlight now.  

926
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:37,840
How horrible that was! Such terrible 
things were for the darkness, not the day.

927
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,120
After he had drunk his cup of chocolate, he 
went over to the table and wrote two letters.  

928
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,600
One he put in his pocket, and the 
other he handed to his servant.

929
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:55,840
'Take this round to 152 Hertford Street, Francis. 
If Mr Campbell is out of town, get his address.'

930
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,320
When the servant had gone, he lit a cigarette, 
and began drawing on a piece of paper.  

931
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:08,640
First he drew flowers, then houses, then 
human faces. Suddenly he realized that  

932
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:14,000
every face he drew looked like Basil Hallward. 
He frowned and went over to lie on the sofa.

933
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,320
An hour went past very slowly. Every 
second he kept looking up at the clock.  

934
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,680
As the minutes went by he became horribly worried.  

935
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,560
He got up and walked around the 
room. His hands were strangely cold.

936
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,920
At last the door opened, and his servant entered.

937
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,920
'Mr Campbell, sir,' said the man.

938
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,480
The colour came back to his cheeks.

939
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:45,840
'Ask him to come in at once, Francis.' He 
felt himself again. His fear had gone away.

940
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:52,240
In a few moments Alan Campbell walked in. 
He looked very angry and rather worried.

941
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,560
'Alan! This is kind of you. 
I thank you for coming.'

942
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:03,280
'I hoped never to enter your house again, Gray. 
But you said it was a question of life and death.'  

943
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,320
His voice was hard and cold, and he kept 
his hands in the pockets of his coat.

944
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:15,840
'Yes, it is a question of life and death, 
Alan. And to more than one person. Sit down.'

945
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:24,320
Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian 
sat opposite him. The two men's eyes met. In  

946
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:29,840
Dorian's there was great sadness. He knew 
that what he was going to do was terrible.

947
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,280
After a moment of silence, 
Dorian said very quietly,  

948
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:41,200
'Alan, in a locked room at the top of the house, 
a dead man is sitting at a table. He has been  

949
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:47,120
dead for ten hours now. Don't stir, and don't 
look at me like that. You don't need to know  

950
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:54,000
who this man is. You don't need to know how 
or why he died. What you have to do is this -'

951
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,040
'Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything 
more. I don't care if what you tell me is  

952
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,920
true or not true. I don't want any part in your 
life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.  

953
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,160
They don't interest me any more.'

954
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:13,040
'Alan, they will have to interest you. I am 
awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can't help  

955
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:19,040
myself. You are the one man who can save me. Alan, 
you are a scientist. You know about chemistry,  

956
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,160
and things of that kind. What you have got to 
do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs.'

957
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,400
'You are mad, Dorian. I will 
have nothing to do with this.'

958
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,880
'He killed himself, Alan.'

959
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,520
'I am glad of that. But who 
made him do it? You, I suppose.'

960
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,720
'Do you still refuse to do this for me?'

961
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,960
'Of course I refuse.  

962
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,160
You have come to the wrong man. Go to 
some of your friends. Don't come to me.'

963
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:50,320
'Alan, it was murder. I killed him. 
You don't know what he made me suffer.'

964
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:56,560
'Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have 
come to? I will have nothing to do with it.'

965
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,520
'You must have something to do with 
it. Don't ask any more questions.  

966
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:07,600
I have told you too much already. But you 
must do this. We were friends once, Alan.'

967
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,760
'Don't speak of those days, 
Dorian. They are dead.'

968
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,480
'They will hang me for this, 
Alan. Don't you understand?  

969
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,080
They will kill me for what I have done.'

970
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:21,280
Campbell got up to leave. 'I will 
not have anything to do with this.'

971
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,200
'You refuse?'

972
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,320
'Yes.'

973
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,880
The same look of sadness 
came into Dorian Gray's eyes.  

974
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,400
Then he took a piece of paper 
and wrote something on it.  

975
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,320
He read it over and pushed it across the table. 
Then he got up and went over to the window.

976
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,560
Campbell looked at him in 
surprise and picked up the paper.  

977
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,800
As he read it, his face went white, 
and he fell back in his chair.

978
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,760
After two or three minutes without 
speaking, Dorian came and stood next to him.

979
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,560
'I am very sorry for you, Alan,' he 
said, putting his hand on his shoulder.  

980
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,720
'But there is no other way. I have a 
letter written already. Here it is.  

981
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,000
You see the address. If you 
don't help me, I will send it.  

982
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,960
You know what will happen. But you are going to 
help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now.'

983
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,840
Campbell put his face in his hands.

984
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,120
'The thing is quite simple, Alan. It 
has to be done. Face it, and do it.'

985
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,200
A terrible sound came from Campbell's lips.

986
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,840
'Come, Alan, you must decide now.'

987
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,160
Alan paused for a moment. 'Is 
there a fire in the room upstairs?'

988
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,560
'Yes, there is a gas fire.'

989
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,840
'I must go home and get some... things.'

990
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,200
'No, Alan, you must not leave the house.  

991
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,960
Write out what you want, and my 
servant will get the things for you.'

992
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,520
It was nearly two o'clock when 
the servant returned with an  

993
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,040
enormous wooden box filled with 
the things Campbell had asked for.

994
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,080
'You can have the rest of the 
day to yourself, Francis.'

995
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,160
'Thank you, sir.'

996
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,640
When the servant had left, the two men carried 
the box up the stairs. Dorian took out the key  

997
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:20,480
and turned it in the lock. Then he stopped and 
Campbell saw that his eyes were full of tears.  

998
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,560
'I don't think I can go in, Alan,' he said.

999
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,960
'I don't need you,' said Campbell coldly.

1000
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:36,400
Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw 
the face of the portrait staring in the sunlight.  

1001
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,920
He remembered that the night before 
he had forgotten to cover the picture.  

1002
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,520
He was about to rush forward when he 
saw something that made him jump back.

1003
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:49,760
There was blood on one of the hands 
in the portrait. How horrible it was!

1004
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,840
He hurried into the room, trying not to look 
at the dead man. Picking the curtain off the  

1005
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,840
floor he threw it over the picture. Then he 
rushed out of the room and down the stairs.

1006
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,720
It was long after seven when 
Campbell came back into the library.  

1007
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:15,360
He was quiet and white in the face, but very calm. 
'I have done what you asked me to do,' he said.  

1008
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,240
'And now goodbye. Let us 
never see each other again.'

1009
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,440
'You have saved me, Alan. I cannot 
forget that,' said Dorian, simply.

1010
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:34,160
When Campbell had left he went upstairs. 
There was a horrible smell in the room.  

1011
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,960
But the thing that had been 
sitting at the table was gone.
 
 

1012
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,240
CHAPTER TWELVE

1013
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,120
'Why Do You Look so Young?'

1014
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,720
'Don't tell me that you are going 
to be good,' cried Lord Henry.  

1015
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,280
'You're quite perfect. Don't change.'

1016
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,280
Dorian Gray shook his head. 'No, Harry,  

1017
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,840
I have done too many terrible things in my life. 
I am not going to do any more. But tell me,  

1018
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,560
what is happening here in London? I have been 
out of the country for more than a month.'

1019
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,600
'People are still discussing 
poor Basil's disappearance.'

1020
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,400
'Are they not bored with that yet?' said 
Dorian, pouring out some wine and frowning.

1021
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:24,640
'My dear boy, they have only been 
talking about it for six weeks.

1022
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,640
The British only need one subject 
of conversation every three months.  

1023
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:34,800
They have been very lucky recently, though. First 
there was the scandal of my wife leaving me,  

1024
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,560
and then Alan Campbell killed himself. Now there 
is the mysterious disappearance of an artist.  

1025
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,080
The British police are saying that Basil did 
take the midnight train on the ninth of November,  

1026
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,320
but the French police are sure that 
he never arrived in Paris at all.'

1027
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:57,280
'What do you think has happened to Basil?' asked 
Dorian, holding up his wine against the light.

1028
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:04,800
'I have no idea. If Basil wants to hide himself, 
it is no business of mine. If he is dead,  

1029
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:10,240
I don't want to think about him. Death is the 
only thing that ever frightens me. I hate it.'

1030
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,480
'Why?' said the younger man, in a tired voice.

1031
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:21,840
'Because,' said Lord Henry, 'it is the only 
thing that is final. Let us have our coffee  

1032
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:27,680
in the music room, Dorian. You must play Chopin 
to me. The man who ran away with my wife played  

1033
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:34,400
Chopin beautifully. Poor Victoria! I was very fond 
of her. The house is quite lonely without her.'

1034
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,480
Dorian said nothing, but went into 
the next room and sat at the piano.  

1035
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:44,480
After the coffee had been 
brought in, he stopped playing.

1036
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,760
'Harry,' he said, looking over at Lord 
Henry. 'Do you think Basil was murdered?'

1037
01:38:53,200 --> 01:39:00,080
Lord Henry yawned. 'Everyone liked Basil. Who 
would want to murder him? He was not clever enough  

1038
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:06,000
to have enemies. Of course he was a wonderful 
painter. But a man can paint like Velasquez  

1039
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,480
and yet still be rather boring. 
Basil was really rather boring.  

1040
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:14,400
The only thing that interested me 
about him was that he worshipped you.'

1041
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:23,120
'I was very fond of Basil,' said Dorian 
sadly. 'But don't people say he was murdered?'

1042
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,360
'Oh, some newspapers do. But 
I don't think it is likely.  

1043
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:32,320
I know there are awful places in Paris, but 
Basil was not the sort of man to go to them.'

1044
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,840
'What would you say, Harry, if I 
told you that I had murdered Basil?'  

1045
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,640
said the younger man. He watched 
him carefully after he had spoken.

1046
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,280
'No, Dorian, you would not murder 
anyone. It is ordinary people who  

1047
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:55,520
murder. It is their way of finding the 
extraordinary pleasure that art gives us.'

1048
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,840
'A way of finding the extraordinary pleasure?  

1049
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:05,360
Do you think that a man who has murdered 
could do it again. Don't tell me that.'

1050
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:11,520
'Oh! Anything becomes a pleasure if you do 
it too often,' cried Lord Henry, laughing.  

1051
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,320
'That is one of the most important 
secrets of life. I believe, though,  

1052
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:21,840
that murder is always a mistake. One should never 
do anything one cannot talk about after dinner.  

1053
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:28,000
But let us pass from poor Basil. I wish I could 
believe that he has died some romantic death,  

1054
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,560
but I can't. He probably fell into the Seine 
off a bus. I can see him now lying on his back  

1055
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:39,440
in the dirty green water. During the last 
ten years he had not been painting well.'

1056
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,480
Lord Henry walked across the room 
and touched the head of a strange  

1057
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,640
grey bird that he kept in the music 
room. Then he turned to face Dorian.

1058
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,040
'Yes,' he continued, taking his 
handkerchief out of his pocket,  

1059
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,880
'his painting seemed to me to have lost something. 
When you and he stopped being great friends,  

1060
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:06,480
he stopped being a great artist. What was it that 
separated you? I suppose he bored you. If so,  

1061
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:11,760
he never forgave you. By the way, what happened 
to that wonderful portrait he did of you?  

1062
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,000
I don't think I have ever 
seen it since he finished it.'

1063
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,840
'I told you years ago that it was stolen.'

1064
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,080
'Oh! I remember. You never got it back?  

1065
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:28,480
What a shame! It really was wonderful. I remember 
I wanted to buy it. I wish I had it now.'

1066
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:34,000
'I never really liked it,' said 
Dorian. 'I am sorry I sat for  

1067
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,320
it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me.'

1068
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:43,680
'How sad you look! Don't be so serious. Play 
me some music, Dorian. And, as you play,  

1069
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:50,080
tell me in a low voice why you still look so 
young. I am only ten years older than you are,  

1070
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:55,280
and I have grey hair and yellow skin. 
You are really wonderful, Dorian.'

1071
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,000
'Harry, please -'

1072
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,480
'You have never looked more 
charming than you do tonight.  

1073
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:07,120
You remind me of the day I first saw you. You 
were very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.  

1074
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,320
You have changed, of course, but not 
in appearance. You are still the same.'

1075
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,360
'I am not the same, Harry.'

1076
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:20,560
'Yes, you are the same. I wish I 
could change places with you, Dorian.  

1077
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,280
The world has cried out against us 
both, but it has always worshipped you.  

1078
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,920
It always will worship you. 
Life has been your art.'

1079
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,800
Dorian got up from the piano, and 
passed his hand through his hair.  

1080
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,840
'Yes, life has been beautiful,' he said, quietly, 
'but I am not going to have the same life,  

1081
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:46,400
Harry. And you must not say these things 
to me. You don't know everything about  

1082
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:53,520
me. I think that if you did, even you would 
turn away from me. You laugh. Don't laugh.'

1083
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,040
'Why have you stopped playing, 
Dorian? Let us go to the club.  

1084
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,400
It has been a charming evening, 
and we must end it charmingly.  

1085
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:08,400
There is someone I want to introduce to you - 
young Lord Poole. He has already copied your  

1086
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:13,360
ties and he very much wants to meet you. He 
is quite charming and he reminds me of you.'

1087
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:20,400
'I hope not,' said Dorian, with a sad 
look in his eyes. 'But I am tired tonight,  

1088
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:25,120
Harry. I won't go to the club. It is nearly 
eleven, and I want to go to bed early.'

1089
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,000
'Please stay. You have never 
played so well as tonight.'

1090
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,560
'It is because I am going to 
be good,' he answered, smiling.  

1091
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,840
'I am a little changed already.'

1092
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,000
'You can't change to me, Dorian,' said Lord Henry.  

1093
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,840
'You and I will always be friends. Come 
round tomorrow. We shall go to lunch.'

1094
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,360
'Do you really want me to come, Harry?'

1095
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,960
'Certainly. The park is quite 
lovely now. I don't think there  

1096
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,440
have been such flowers since the year I met you.'

1097
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:05,840
'Very well. I shall be here at eleven,' 
said Dorian. 'Good-night, Harry.'
 
 

1098
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,200
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1099
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,280
'To Kill the Past'

1100
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:17,840
It was a lovely night. He walked home, with his 
coat on his arm, smoking his cigarette. Two young  

1101
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,680
men in evening dress passed him. He heard one of 
them whisper to the other, 'That is Dorian Gray'.  

1102
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,880
He remembered how pleased he used to be 
when he was stared at, or talked about.  

1103
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,000
He was tired of hearing his own name now.

1104
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,880
When he reached home, he found 
his servant waiting up for him.  

1105
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,400
He sent him to bed, and threw himself 
down on the sofa in the library.  

1106
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,720
He began to think about some of the 
things that Lord Henry had said to him.

1107
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,320
Was it really true that one could never change?  

1108
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:55,280
There had been a time when he had been good 
and innocent. He had corrupted himself,  

1109
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:00,320
and become a terrible influence on others. He 
had even got pleasure from this corruption.  

1110
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:07,680
Yet his soul had once been the purest of all. 
Was all that gone? Was there no hope for him?

1111
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,920
In one terrible moment of passion, he 
had asked to stay young for all time.  

1112
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:19,120
All his failure had been because 
of that. He had not been punished,  

1113
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:24,400
but perhaps punishment was what he had 
needed. Punishment cleaned the soul.

1114
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:32,640
The mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so 
many years ago now, was standing on the table. He  

1115
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:37,280
picked it up, remembering that horrible night when 
he had first noticed the change in the picture.  

1116
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,240
Once, someone who had loved him 
passionately had written him a mad letter.  

1117
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:49,600
It had ended with these words: 'The world 
is changed because you are made of gold.'  

1118
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,920
He repeated them to himself and suddenly 
realized that he hated his own beauty.  

1119
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,640
Throwing the mirror on the floor, he broke 
the glass into little pieces with his foot.  

1120
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,600
It was his beauty that had spoiled him.

1121
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:12,000
It was better not to think of the past. Nothing 
could change that. He had to think of his future.  

1122
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,320
Alan Campbell had shot himself one night, 
and his terrible secret had died with him.  

1123
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:21,920
The interest in Basil Hallward's disappearance 
would soon pass away. He was perfectly safe there.

1124
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:28,400
What worried him was the death of his own soul. 
Basil had painted the portrait that had destroyed  

1125
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:34,480
his life. He could not forgive him that. It 
was the portrait that had done everything.  

1126
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,280
The murder had just been 
the madness of the moment.  

1127
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:43,040
As for Alan Campbell, he had killed himself. 
It was nothing to do with Dorian Gray.

1128
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,200
A new life! That was what he wanted. 
That was what he was waiting for.  

1129
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:55,600
Perhaps it had begun already. He would never 
again spoil innocence. He would be good.

1130
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,720
He began to wonder if the portrait 
in the locked room had changed.  

1131
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,520
Was it still as horrible as it had 
been? Perhaps if his life became pure,  

1132
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,120
the face in the portrait would become 
beautiful again. He would go and look.

1133
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,720
He took the lamp from the table and went upstairs.  

1134
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:20,960
As he opened the door, a smile of happiness passed 
across his young face. Yes, he would be good,  

1135
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:27,040
and the ugly thing he had locked away would not 
frighten him any more. He felt happier already.

1136
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,760
He went in quietly, locking the door behind him.  

1137
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,960
Walking straight over to the portrait, he took 
off the purple curtain that was covering it.  

1138
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:44,880
An angry cry of pain came from him. He could see 
no change. The thing was still hateful - more  

1139
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,240
hateful, even, than before. The red mark on the 
hand seemed brighter and more like new blood.  

1140
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:56,800
And why was the red mark larger than it had 
been? It was all over the fingers now. There  

1141
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,800
was blood on the painted feet, and blood 
on the hand that had not held the knife.

1142
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,840
What did it all mean? That he should go to the 
police? That he should tell the whole story, and  

1143
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:15,040
be put to death? He laughed. He felt the idea was 
absurd. If he did tell them now, who would believe  

1144
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:20,720
him? There was nothing left of the murdered man 
anywhere. He had destroyed everything belonging  

1145
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:27,040
to Basil Hallward. He himself had burned the bag 
and the coat. They would simply say he was mad.

1146
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,160
Was this murder to follow him all his life? Was 
he always going to suffer because of his past?  

1147
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,440
Yet what could he do? Go to the police? Never.

1148
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:46,960
There was only one thing they could use against 
him and that was the picture itself. He would  

1149
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:53,120
destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it 
had given him pleasure to watch it changing and  

1150
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:58,560
growing old. Recently he had felt no such 
pleasure. It had kept him awake at night.  

1151
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,760
When he had been away, he had been 
frightened that another person would see it.  

1152
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:07,120
Just the memory of it spoiled many 
moments of happiness. He would destroy it.

1153
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:13,280
He looked around and saw the knife that had 
killed Basil Hallward. He had cleaned it many  

1154
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:20,240
times until there was no mark left on it. It was 
bright, and it shone. It had killed the painter.  

1155
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:25,200
Now it would kill the painter's work, and 
all that it meant. It would kill the past.  

1156
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:33,840
When that was dead he would be free. He picked 
up the knife and pushed it into the picture.

1157
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:42,880
There was a cry, and a crash. The cry was so 
horrible that frightened servants woke and  

1158
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,680
came out of their rooms. Two gentlemen, who 
were passing in the Square below, stopped,  

1159
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:52,400
and looked up at the great house. They hurried on 
until they met a policeman, and brought him back.  

1160
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,960
The policeman rang the bell several 
times, but there was no answer.  

1161
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,520
Except for a light in one of the 
top windows, the house was all dark.  

1162
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:07,200
After a time, he went away and stood in 
the garden of the next house and watched.

1163
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:12,160
'Whose house is that?' asked 
the older of the two gentlemen.

1164
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,080
'Mr Dorian Gray's, sir,' answered the policeman.

1165
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:23,840
They looked at each other as they walked away, and 
laughed cruelly. They knew who Dorian Gray was.

1166
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,280
Inside the house the servants were 
talking in low whispers to each other.  

1167
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:34,720
Old Mrs Leaf was crying. 
Francis was as white as death.

1168
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:39,920
After about a quarter of an hour, 
they went fearfully upstairs.  

1169
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:49,280
They knocked, but there was no reply. They called 
out. Everything was still. They tried the door.  

1170
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:55,840
It was locked. Finally, they got on the roof 
and came into the room through the window.

1171
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,760
When they entered the room they 
found a portrait hanging on the wall.  

1172
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:10,640
It showed Mr Dorian Gray as they had last seen 
him, young and beautiful. Lying on the floor was  

1173
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:20,160
a dead man in evening dress. He had a knife 
in his heart. He was old and horribly ugly.  

1174
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:30,320
It was not until they saw his rings that 
they recognized who the man was.
 
 
 
 

1175
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:30,835
- THE END -
