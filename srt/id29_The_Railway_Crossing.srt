1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:07,950
Dunstan Thwaite looked at the railway crossing
and decided that it was time for John Dunn

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,000
to die.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,970
It was a very suitable place for a murder.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:20,270
There were trees all around, and they hid
the trains which came so fast along the railway

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,370
line.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:30,180
The nearest house was Thwaite's own, and this
was also hidden by the trees.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,620
People and traffic did not use the crossing
very often, and the big gates were kept locked.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,719
There was a small gate used by passengers
going to the station, but at night it was

9
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,989
always quiet.

10
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:51,249
Thwaite was a worried man.

11
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:55,440
He had to use sleeping powders to help him
sleep.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,639
But after tonight, things were going to be
different.

13
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:05,239
The time had come to stop the blackmail.

14
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,960
The time had come for John Dunn to die.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,710
It all began five years earlier...

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,250
Thwaite worked in the offices of a large company,
and his only money was the money that the

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,770
company paid him.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,930
It was not much, but it was enough.

19
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:36,340
Then he met the beautiful Miss Hilda Lorraine
and asked her to marry him.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,100
She came from an important family who were
supposed to be very rich, but in fact they

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,079
had less money than Thwaite had thought.

22
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,649
He learned that he would have to pay for the
wedding himself.

23
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,280
And he did not have enough money for the expensive
kind of wedding that Miss Lorraine wanted.

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,880
So Thwaite stole a thousand pounds, by changing
the figures in the company's books.

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,140
He planned to put the money back after he
was married, but someone discovered that it

26
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,520
was missing.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,790
Thwaite kept quiet.

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,020
Another man was thought to be the thief, and
he lost his job.

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,140
Thwaite still said nothing.

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,540
But John Dunn worked in the same office.

31
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,720
He worked closely with Thwaite and guessed
Thwaite's crime.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,930
He searched through the company's books until
he found what he was looking for.

33
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,070
Then he went to Thwaite.

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,600
'Sorry to have to ask you, Mr Thwaite,' he
said.

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,740
'I need a hundred pounds... for my son.

36
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,870
He's in a bit of trouble, you see...'

37
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,330
'But you don't have a son,' said Thwaite.

38
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,090
Dunn just smiled.

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,430
It wasn't a very nice smile.

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,010
'A hundred pounds,' he said again.

41
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,930
And then Thwaite knew that he was being blackmailed.

42
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,090
He paid Dunn one hundred pounds, and Dunn
said nothing more for a year.

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,920
During that time, Thwaite got married.

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
Then the day came when Dunn asked him for
more money.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,810
'Two hundred and fifty pounds,' he said to
Thwaite.

46
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,650
'I can't pay-' began Thwaite.

47
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,590
But he did.

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,480
Either he paid or he went to prison.

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,100
It went on for five years, and each time Dunn
wanted more money.

50
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,160
Thwaite found it difficult to live on the
money that he was left with.

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,840
His wife liked expensive things.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,820
An expensive house, an expensive car, visits
to expensive restaurants.

53
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,120
She also discovered that some of the money
her husband was paid each year seemed to disappear.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,290
He tried to lie about it, but he knew that
she thought he was paying to keep another

55
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,630
woman.

56
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,470
Oh, how he hated John Dunn!

57
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,610
Something must happen!

58
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,850
And then he remembered the railway crossing.

59
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,230
It was not a new idea.

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,430
Weeks before, he had thought about what could
happen there.

61
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,030
The idea came when the doctor gave him some
powders to help him sleep.

62
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,560
He thought about giving Dunn enough of them
to kill him, but then he got a better idea.

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:00,410
Although he was afraid, Thwaite slowly realized
that murder was the only answer to his problem.

64
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,930
Then Dunn asked for more money.

65
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,930
'Five hundred pounds, Mr Thwaite,' Dunn told
him.

66
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,760
'Five hundred!' said Thwaite.

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,630
'Why not ask for the moon?

68
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,600
You'll get neither one nor the other.'

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,060
'Five hundred,' repeated Dunn, calmly.

70
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,180
It was then that Thwaite decided to murder
the other man.

71
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,480
He pretended to think about the money for
a moment, then he said, 'Come to my house

72
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,940
tomorrow night and we'll talk.'

73
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,210
He remembered his wife was going to be away
in London all night.

74
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,890
'And bring those papers from the office which
you want me to look at.'

75
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,680
'All right,' said Dunn.

76
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,310
The following evening, Thwaite put two hundred
pounds in his pocket.

77
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,580
Then he put half of one of his sleeping powders
into a whisky bottle.

78
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,880
There was only enough whisky for two glasses,
but there was an unopened bottle next to it.

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,590
Next he put a hammer into one pocket of his
overcoat, and a torch into the other pocket.

80
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,840
The coat was outside the door of his study.

81
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:32,540
Lastly, he moved the hands on his watch and
on the study clock forward by ten minutes.

82
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,650
Those extra ten minutes would give him his
alibi.

83
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,060
Thwaite knew that he must be extra careful.

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,530
He knew that people at the office thought
there was some secret between him and Dunn.

85
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,730
A secret that Thwaite didn't want anyone to
know.

86
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:59,770
'If Dunn is killed,' he thought, 'they'll
wonder if it was really an accident, or if

87
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,090
I murdered him.'

88
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:08,210
But if his plan went well, the police would
believe that he hadn't left the house.

89
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,710
Thwaite sat down to wait for John Dunn.

90
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,740
He thought about what he was going to do.

91
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,320
Murder!

92
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,140
He could almost see his hand holding the hammer
above Dunn; could hear the awful sound of

93
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,480
it crashing down on to the man's head.

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,870
He could see Dunn's dead body!

95
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:39,550
Dead all except the eyes, which looked at
Thwaite... followed him everywhere he went...

96
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,850
He tried to calm himself.

97
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,940
He remembered why he was doing this.

98
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,250
When Dunn was dead, his problems were over.

99
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,490
Half an hour later, Dunn arrived.

100
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,720
Jane opened the door.

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,090
Jane was the servant who lived in the house
with Thwaite and his wife.

102
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,580
She brought Dunn into the study.

103
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,860
Thwaite smiled in a friendly way.

104
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,460
'Oh, good.

105
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,520
You've brought those papers for me to see,
Dunn.

106
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,330
Thank you.'

107
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,740
After Jane left, the two men looked at each
other.

108
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,430
'Give me the papers,' Thwaite said.

109
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,870
'I'll look at them now that you've brought
them.'

110
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:31,070
Fifteen minutes later, he gave the papers
back to Dunn and sat back in his chair.

111
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,289
'Now, about that other matter.'

112
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,419
He got up.

113
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,139
'But why not have a drink first?'

114
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,449
'No, thank you,' said Dunn.

115
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,740
He looked afraid.

116
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,740
'What are you afraid of?' said Thwaite.

117
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,129
He gave Dunn the opened whisky bottle and
two glasses.

118
00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:00,130
'We can both drink the same whisky, if you
like.

119
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,690
Here, you do it.'

120
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,559
After a moment, Dunn put whisky into each
glass, then he waited until Thwaite drank

121
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,759
before he drank his own.

122
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,500
Thwaite watched him.

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,970
How long before the other man began to feel
sleepy?

124
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,790
Thwaite needed all of one sleeping powder
to make him sleep, but Dunn did not usually

125
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,209
take them.

126
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:36,649
'Listen, Dunn,' said Thwaite, 'I haven't got
five hundred pounds, but I can give you this.'

127
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:41,749
He took the money from his pocket and put
it on the table.

128
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,850
Dunn counted it.

129
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,839
'Two hundred?' he said, with a laugh.

130
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,879
'Are you trying to be funny?'

131
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,790
'I'm not saying it will be the last,' said
Thwaite.

132
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,619
'Take it now and be pleased that you've got
it.'

133
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,790
Dunn shook his head.

134
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,129
'Five hundred, Mr Thwaite.'

135
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,509
'I've told you, I can't do it,' said Thwaite.

136
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,759
'And I won't do it.

137
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,089
You can tell everyone what I did - I don't
care anymore.

138
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,300
It's been five years, and I've done a lot
of good work for the company during that time.

139
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,069
I saved them a lot more than a thousand pounds.

140
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,410
I'll sell this house and pay them back.

141
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,339
I'll take my punishment, then I'll go and
live in another country and give myself a

142
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:35,339
new name.'

143
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,610
'And your wife?' said Dunn.

144
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,740
'My wife will leave the country first,' Thwaite
told him.

145
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,009
'She'll wait for me to come out of prison.

146
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,819
It won't be more than two or three years.

147
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:58,269
So you can take the two hundred pounds, or
you can do your worst!'

148
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,589
The powder in the whisky was beginning to
make Dunn sleepy.

149
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,580
He looked stupidly at Thwaite, and Thwaite
began to worry.

150
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,410
Had he given the other man too much?

151
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,800
He looked at the clock.

152
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,779
There was not much time left.

153
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,600
'Will you take it, or leave it?' asked Thwaite.

154
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,180
'Five hundred,' said Dunn, in a heavy voice.

155
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,309
'I want five hundred.'

156
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:38,029
'You can go and do your worst,' said Thwaite.

157
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,940
Dunn held out a shaking hand.

158
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,519
'Come on, pay me.'

159
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,699
Thwaite began to worry again.

160
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,259
'Are you feeling all right, Dunn?

161
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,470
Have some more whisky.'

162
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,089
He opened the other bottle and put some whisky
in Dunn's glass.

163
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,680
Dunn drank it, and it seemed to make him feel
better.

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,730
'That was strange,' he said.

165
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,239
'I didn't feel very well, but I feel a little
better now.'

166
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,950
'If you're going to catch your train, you
must go,' said Thwaite.

167
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:19,790
'Tell me tomorrow what you finally decide
to do.

168
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,939
Take the two hundred with you.'

169
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:27,890
Dunn thought for a moment, then picked up
the money.

170
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,009
He looked at his watch, then looked at the
study clock.

171
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,929
'Your clock is wrong,' he said.

172
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,920
'I have ten more minutes.'

173
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,209
'Wrong?'

174
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,620
said Thwaite.

175
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,319
He looked at his own watch.

176
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:46,060
'It's your watch that's wrong.

177
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,800
Look at mine.'

178
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,750
Dunn looked and seemed unable to understand
it.

179
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:59,199
He stood up... and almost fell back again.

180
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,999
Thwaite hid a smile.

181
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,459
This was how he wanted Dunn to be.

182
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:08,179
'You're not feeling well,' he said.

183
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,930
'I'll take you to the station.

184
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,810
Wait until I get my coat.'

185
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,290
Now that the time was here, Thwaite felt cool
and calm.

186
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,220
He put on his coat, feeling the hammer in
the pocket, then went back into the study.

187
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,529
'We'll go out this way,' he said.

188
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,540
There was a side door from the study into
the garden.

189
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:42,429
Thwaite closed it silently and it locked automatically
behind him.

190
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:49,249
It was his plan to return that way, go in
quietly again, and then to change the clock

191
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,189
and his watch back to the right time.

192
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:59,670
Then he would shout 'Goodnight', and close
the front door very loudly, pretending that

193
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,529
somebody had left just then.

194
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:10,319
Next, he would call Jane and ask for some
coffee, making sure that she saw the clock.

195
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:18,269
Then, if the police asked her later, Jane
could say that Thwaite did not leave the house

196
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:24,470
and that Dunn went to catch his train at the
right time.

197
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,019
It was a dry night, but very dark.

198
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,399
A train carrying freight went slowly by.

199
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,139
Thwaite smiled to himself.

200
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:39,069
There were plenty of freight trains at that
time of the night.

201
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,999
He needed one of them to hide his crime for
him.

202
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:48,199
He planned to hit Dunn on the head with the
hammer, then put his body on the railway line.

203
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,910
A freight train would do the rest.

204
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:58,089
Slowly, the two men walked on, Thwaite holding
Dunn's arm.

205
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,709
A light wind moved among the trees.

206
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,809
Thwaite gently pushed the half-asleep Dunn
forwards.

207
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:11,910
He put his hand into his pocket for the hammer...

208
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,910
And stopped.

209
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,149
His keys!

210
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:23,879
They were still inside the house, and he could
not get back in without them!

211
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,230
He would have to ring the front door bell.

212
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,329
His alibi was destroyed!

213
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,899
It was a bad mistake.

214
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,309
Everything was wrong now.

215
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,569
He couldn't go on with the murder.

216
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:44,920
'Most murderers make mistakes,' thought Thwaite,
trying to calm himself.

217
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,509
'I've been the same.'

218
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,290
But he was shaking with fear as he thought
about the mistake.

219
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,089
Suddenly, he could not walk another step with
Dunn.

220
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,999
'Goodnight,' he said to the other man.

221
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:06,629
And before they reached the crossing, he turned
and walked back to the house.

222
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:14,899
For ten minutes, Thwaite walked up and down
outside until he began to feel calm again.

223
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:16,420
Then he rang the bell.

224
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,589
A few moments later, Jane opened the door.

225
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,610
'Thank you, Jane,' he said.

226
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,920
'I went to see Mr Dunn over the crossing,
and I forgot my keys.'

227
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,259
He went to bed a happier man.

228
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,369
He was not a murderer.

229
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:42,949
When he was eating his breakfast the next
morning, he decided what to do.

230
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:49,089
'I'll tell them at the office that I stole
the thousand pounds,' he said to himself.

231
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:55,059
'I'll take my punishment, and then I can have
some peace again.'

232
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:58,799
It suddenly seemed so easy.

233
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,550
Until Jane came in.

234
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,120
'Have you heard the news, sir?'

235
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,329
she said.

236
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,339
'Mr Dunn was killed by a train on the crossing
last night.

237
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,370
A man who was working on the railway line
found him this morning.'

238
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,039
Thwaite slowly went white.

239
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,579
Jane was looking at him strangely.

240
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,809
What was she thinking?

241
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,640
What story did he tell her the night before?

242
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,220
He couldn't remember!

243
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,670
'Dunn killed!' he said.

244
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,760
'How terrible, Jane!

245
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,039
I'll go down.'

246
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,539
The body was in a small railway building,
near the line.

247
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,669
There was a policeman outside.

248
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:50,260
'A sad accident, Mr Thwaite,' the policeman
said.

249
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,779
'You knew the man, didn't you, sir?'

250
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,580
'He worked in my office,' replied Thwaite.

251
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,010
'He was with me last night, discussing business.

252
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,289
I suppose this happened on his way home.

253
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,510
It's terrible!'

254
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,720
'It's very sad, sir,' said the policeman.

255
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,230
'But accidents will happen.'

256
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,809
'I know that,' said Thwaite.

257
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,399
'But I wish he hadn't drunk so much of my
whisky.

258
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,760
I was going to walk with him to the station.'

259
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,970
The policeman looked closely at Thwaite.

260
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,860
'And did you, sir?'

261
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,029
'No,' said Thwaite.

262
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,279
'The cold night air seemed to make him feel
better.

263
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,740
I turned back before the crossing.'

264
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,340
The policeman said no more, but later that
day two more policemen came to the office.

265
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,500
'Have they talked to Jane?' wondered Thwaite.

266
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,720
Again he told them, 'I left Dunn before we
reached the railway crossing.'

267
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,380
They wrote down what he said to them, then
went away.

268
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,960
Next day, they came back.

269
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,200
There were things that Thwaite could not explain
to them.

270
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,310
Why did the whisky bottle contain what was
left of a sleeping powder?

271
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,610
Why was the study clock wrong by ten minutes?

272
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:23,799
(At dinner-time earlier on the same evening,
Jane had noticed that it was right.)

273
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,779
And why was a hammer found in his overcoat
pocket?

274
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:33,889
Then the police found papers in Dunn's house.

275
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,660
The handwriting on them was Dunn's.

276
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:44,980
It told the story of Thwaite and the thousand
pounds, and it told how Thwaite was a thief.

277
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,350
The police then discovered that money taken
from Thwaite's bank account over the last

278
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,429
five years always appeared a few days later
in Dunn's bank book.

279
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:03,650
Lastly, the time of death was known to be
10.30 pm because Dunn's blood was found on

280
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,690
the train that went through the railway crossing
at that time.

281
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:14,490
It was also seven minutes before Jane opened
the front door to let Thwaite back in.

282
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,149
At first, Thwaite had no answers to all their
questions.

283
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:27,870
Finally, on his last morning, he told them
the true story.

284
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,510
Then he went to his death bravely.

285
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,870
- THE END -
