00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,520
Farmer and Soldier

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,400
At the height of its power, the great Roman Empire stretched from the deserts of Africa to the borders of northern
England.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,600
Over one quarter of the world's population lived and died
under the rule of the Caesars.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:28,720
In the winter of A.D. 180, Emperor Marcus Aurelius's twelve - year war against the people of Germania was coming to an
end.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,320
There was one last battle to win.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Then there would be peace across the Roman Empire.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,920
The man walked through the sun-warmed Spanish field, his
hand touching the wheat.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,120
He looked past apple trees to a farmhouse.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,960
He heard a child laughing somewhere near.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
A bird flew onto the branch of a tree close to him and they
looked at each other.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
The man smiled.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,520
Suddenly, the sound of shouts and horses frightened the bird
and it flew up into the air.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,640
The noise broke through the man's daydream and he came back
to the real world with a crash.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,520
He was not dressed in farmer's clothes, as he had imagined,
but in the proud armor of the Roman army.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,680
The field was burnt and muddy from battle, without a green
leaf on it.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,480
Beyond the tree line ahead, somewhere in the forest, the
German armies were preparing to attack again.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,920
The man knew that behind him an enormous army waited.

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,560
The Roman army, 40,000 men, his army.

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,280
Maximus the farmer was Maximus the Commanding General of the
Army of the North for one more battle.

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,600
One last battle, and then he could go home to Spain.

22
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,640
He turned his horse and rode back to his men.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Thirty-year-old Maximus was a great general-a man they could
trust.

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,040
He moved among them, checking that they were ready for
battle.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,440
He looked back frequently to the line of trees.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,160
Some of his officers were warming themselves around a fire,
and Maximus joined them.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,720
"Still nothing?" he asked Quintus, his second-in-command.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,720
Quintus shook his head.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,400
"He's been gone for almost two hours," he said.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,160
"Why are they taking so long? They only have to say yes or
no."

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,600
A young officer gave Maximus a bowl of hot soup.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,960
He drank it slowly as they talked, always keeping one eye on
the line of trees.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,280
"Snow in the air," said Maximus.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
"I can smell it."

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,120
"Anything's better than this German rain," Quintus said,
looking out at the mud in front of his men.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Suddenly, there was a shout.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,000
"He's coming!"

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,080
All eyes turned to the trees.

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,920
A horseman rode out, toward the Roman army.

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,560
There was something strange about the way he was riding.

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,160
Maximus was the first to understand.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,720
"They say no," he said.

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,720
As the horse came closer, the other men could see what had
happened.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,080
The Roman messenger was tied to his horse.

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,400
His head had been cut off.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,040
Maximus knew now what he had to do.

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Life was suddenly simple.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Far away, at the edge of the trees, a German chief appeared.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,480
In one hand he was holding the head of the messenger.

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,280
He screamed his anger at the Roman army, then threw the head
toward them.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Maximus's men stared back and waited for their general's
order to attack.

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Several carriages traveled along the road toward the battle
area, protected by Roman soldiers.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,560
Inside the first carriage were the royal family-the
Emperor's son and daughter.

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Twenty-eight-year- old Commodus and his beautiful older
sister Lucilla were dressed in rich, warm clothes.

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,080
They had left Rome two weeks before.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,480
"Do you think he's really dying?" Commodus asked Lucilla.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,880
"He's been dying for ten years," she replied.

58
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:26,960
"I think he's really sick this time. And he's sent for us."
He pointed to the following carriages.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,760
"He sent for the senators, too. If he isn't dying, why does
he want to see them?"

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,800
"Commodus, you're giving me a headache. Two weeks on the
road with you is more than enough," said Lucilla,
impatiently.

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Commodus moved closer to her.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,160
"No, he's made his decision," he said.

63
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,760
"He will name me as Emperor. And I know what I shall do
first. I shall organize some games..."

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
"I shall have a hot bath," said Lucilla.

65
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,400
The carriage stopped.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
Commodus stepped down and spoke to one of the guards.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,760
"We are almost there, sir."

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880
"Good," said Commodus.

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,840
"Bring me my horse."

70
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,480
Under his warm traveling coat Commodus was wearing Roman
armor.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,200
He looked handsome and brave, the perfect picture of a new,
young emperor.

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,920
The guard brought Commodus his horse.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,840
"Take me to my father. And take my sister to the camp."
Commodus reached out a hand to Lucilla.

74
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,440
"Kiss," he said, smiling like a little boy.

75
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,520
Lucilla brushed his fingers with her lips, then watched him
ride away.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:50,320
Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, sat on his horse and
stared at the army below.

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,040
His hair and beard were white, but only his eyes really
showed his age and state of health.

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,360
Marcus knew he was dying and soon he must name the next
emperor.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,480
But first this battle must be won.

80
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,760
From another hill, Maximus also looked down onto the Roman
army.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,080
His men were ready to fight.

82
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,120
The German soldiers started to move out from the trees.

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,080
There were thousands of them, dressed in animal skins,
shouting at their Roman enemies.

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,240
Maximus bent down from his horse and took some earth in his
hands, as he did before every battle.

85
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,120
Then he let it fall through his fingers.

86
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,840
It was a sign his men had seen many times before and they
knew what it meant.

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Maximus gave the command and a flaming arrow shot into the
sky.

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Hundreds more followed.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,760
Thousands of German soldiers rushed forward and met the
first line of Romans.

90
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:59,360
The air was filled with the sound of screaming as more
arrows landed and men from both armies died terrible deaths.

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:08,480
Maximus led soldiers on horseback into the battle at the same time as 5,000 Roman foot soldiers moved forward from
another side.

92
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,120
Each man marched behind a large shield, each carried a
sword.

93
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,000
The Germans were caught between two walls of death.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Above them the sky was full of flaming arrows.

95
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,080
They were fighting for their lives.

96
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,600
Suddenly, Maximus was trapped between two Germans.

97
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,320
He swung his sword around in a circle, striking both men
dead.

98
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Then he rode forward again, and his sword cut through the
enemy soldiers in his path.

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,160
Maximus's horse suddenly fell forward, a German sword in its
neck.

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,960
The General flew over his horse's head and crashed to the
ground.

101
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,120
There was danger all around him, but he continued fighting.

102
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,400
He found the Roman flag, still in the hand of a dead
soldier, and held it high.

103
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,000
His men fought their way toward it and defended their
position bravely.

104
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,000
More and more Roman soldiers moved forward onto the
battleground.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,760
They were well-trained and had the best equipment and armor.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,600
The Germans were not as good as the confident Roman army and
finally they began to tire.

107
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,200
Maximus saw that he was winning and moved up a little higher
on the hill.

108
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,040
From there he could see and command his men better.

109
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,000
The enemy began to lose confidence and some turned and ran.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,160
More joined them and soon the only Germans on the
battlefield were dead or dying.

111
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,600
Maximus went back down and walked among them.

112
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,280
As he stepped over bodies, he began to relax and let his
sword arm fall to his side.

113
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,120
Behind him, a dying German suddenly lifted himself from the
ground and rushed forward with his sword.

114
00:08:50,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Maximus was calling an order to one of his officers when he saw the sudden look of terror on the officer's face and
immediately swung his sword around, cutting off his attacker's head.

115
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:06,400
There was so much power behind the sword that it flew from
his hand and landed in a tree.

116
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Maximus had no strength left to pull it out again.

117
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,400
The battle had ended.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:21,160
As he looked at the dead around him, he could only think
that his men had won, and he had lived.

119
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,800
CHAPTER TWO

120
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,520
The Last Battle

121
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Emperor Marcus Aurelius sat on his horse, on the top of the
command hill, with guards on each side to protect him.

122
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,680
He watched as the battle slowly progressed and it became
clear that the Roman army had won.

123
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,480
Marcus hoped it would be many years before they had to go to
war again, certainly not before he died.

124
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,880
He had no wish to see another battle.

125
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
He turned to his guards.

126
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,520
"I will leave now," he said.

127
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,200
"I have seen enough."

128
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,640
Maximus looked at his sword in the tree.

129
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,560
His face was covered with blood and mud.

130
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,920
The beat of his heart was beginning to slow down as the
noise of the battle became quieter.

131
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,120
There were other sounds now-screams from the dying and cries
for help.

132
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,000
A small bird flew down from the top of the tree and sat on
Maximus's sword.

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Could it possibly be the same bird he had seen before the
first explosion of battle?

134
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
That seemed like a hundred years ago.

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,520
He shook his head and reached for the sword.

136
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,320
The frightened bird flew away as Maximus pulled his sword
out of the tree.

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,560
Across the field, doctors were trying to help any Roman
soldiers who were still alive.

138
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,360
Other soldiers were walking slowly through the men on the ground, looking for Germans left alive and killing them
quickly.

139
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:11,560
Maximus walked back toward the command point, sometimes stopping to speak to a dying soldier, sometimes calling for
water or medical help.

140
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,080
He came to a low hill where the bodies of Roman soldiers had
been placed, side by side.

141
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,280
"Let the sun always be warm on your back," he said softly.

142
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,200
"You've come home at last."

143
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:34,520
"You're a brave man, Maximus, and a good commander," said a
voice behind him.

144
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,480
"Let us hope it is for the last time."

145
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Maximus turned and saw the Emperor.

146
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,280
"There's no one left to fight, sir," he said.

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,280
"There are always people to fight. More glory."

148
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,520
"The glory is theirs, Caesar," said Maximus, looking at the
lines of dead soldiers.

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,120
"Tell me," said Marcus.

150
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,280
"How can I reward Rome's greatest general?"

151
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,760
"Let me go home," replied Maximus, quickly.

152
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,360
"Ah, home..." said Marcus.

153
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,440
He gave his arm to Maximus, and they walked together back
across the battlefield.

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,440
All eyes followed the long purple coat and white hair of
their emperor.

155
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,280
They could see that he moved slowly and with difficulty.

156
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,520
He was clearly in pain.

157
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,320
Most of the soldiers realized that they were probably seeing
him for the last time.

158
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,880
And they knew Rome was not likely to have such a good
emperor again.

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:51,280
Marcus Aurelius and his general walked along the road, past
lines of tired soldiers.

160
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,920
Hundreds of men resting on a hill stood and raised their
swords high in the air when they saw them pass.

161
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,440
"They honor you, Caesar," said Maximus.

162
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:09,800
"No, Maximus, I believe they honor you," replied the
Emperor.

163
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Maximus looked across at the crowd of brave men and raised
his own sword.

164
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,520
The men cheered him loudly.

165
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,800
Suddenly, Prince Commodus and his guards rode into view.

166
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,120
When he heard the cheering and saw the reason for it,
Commodus was filled with jealousy.

167
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:36,640
Roman soldiers were honoring a Spaniard above the Emperor
and his family-it was not right.

168
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,480
But he tried to look pleased as he rode up to Marcus and
Maximus.

169
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,720
"Have I missed the battle?" he said, jumping from his horse.

170
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,840
"You've missed the war," said Marcus.

171
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,280
"We're finished here."

172
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,560
Commodus put his arms around his father.

173
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,880
"Father, congratulations," he said.

174
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,040
"I shall kill a hundred animals to honor your success."

175
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,120
"Let the animals live and honor Maximus," said Marcus.

176
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,440
"He won the battle."

177
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:22,400
"General," Commodus said, turning to Maximus, "Rome salutes you, and I salute you as a brother." He opened his arms and
put them around Maximus.

178
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,640
"It has been too long since we last met. How long? Ten
years, my old friend?" Commodus turned to Marcus.

179
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,960
"Here, Father, take my arm."

180
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:44,280
Marcus let his hand rest on his son for a minute, then said,
"I think maybe I should leave you now."

181
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Commodus called for Marcus's horse and some of the guards
ran forward to help him.

182
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,920
The old man waved them away and looked at Maximus.

183
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,560
Maximus came quickly to his side and helped him onto the
horse.

184
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,400
Without a word to his son he rode slowly away.

185
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:13,680
Commodus and Maximus stood together and watched the Emperor
go, each thinking their own thoughts about him.

186
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:23,960
Marcus had won many battles for the glory of Rome, but
Maximus would always remember him first as a good man.

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
Commodus's thoughts were very different.

188
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,000
He was angry that his father had not put his arms around
him.

189
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,880
He was jealous because Maximus was asked to help Marcus onto
the horse and the Emperor had spoken privately to him.

190
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,560
He swung himself back onto his horse and rode away, followed
by his guards.

191
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,000
A city of hospital tents had been built.

192
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,680
There were thousands of wounded Roman soldiers, and the
doctors were busy all night.

193
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,640
Maximus came out of one of the tents.

194
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,440
He was sad that so many men were badly hurt, and he knew
that many more would not live until morning.

195
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,240
He turned and walked back to the main camp.

196
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,840
In the biggest tent many of the officers were celebrating.

197
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,320
There was wine and food; they were laughing and shouting.

198
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,880
These were the lucky men who had cheated death.

199
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,440
The Emperor sat in a chair in the center of the tent and
received visitors.

200
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,800
Two senators, Falco and Gaius, had just arrived.

201
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,680
"We greet you, Marcus Aurelius," Falco said.

202
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,080
"And we bring greetings from Senator Gracchus. He waits to
honor you when you return to Rome."

203
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,760
When Maximus entered the tent, officers came forward to meet
him.

204
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Someone gave him wine, others held their hands out to him,
Quintus stopped his conversation when he saw his friend.

205
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,080
"Still alive! The gods must love you!" they both said
together, laughing.

206
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,120
Maximus moved through the tent, with Quintus and some of his
other officers following behind.

207
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,160
Through the forest of men Maximus could see Marcus Aurelius
surrounded by a group of people.

208
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,840
As he got nearer, he saw Commodus at the Emperor's side,
with the two senators.

209
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,080
Maximus paused to speak to another officer.

210
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,840
"Back to Rome now, General?" the man asked.

211
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,760
"I'm going home," Maximus said.

212
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,880
"To my wife, my son, and my fields of wheat."

213
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,520
"Maximus the farmer!" Quintus said, laughing.

214
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,400
"I still can't imagine that."

215
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,680
"Dirt washes off more easily than blood, Quintus," replied
Maximus.

216
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,920
Commodus, Gaius, and Falco came toward Maximus.

217
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,040
"Here he is," said Commodus.

218
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
"The hero of the war!"

219
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,200
Maximus was not happy that Commodus had said this in front
of his brave officers.

220
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
To him they were all heroes.

221
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Commodus introduced the two senators.

222
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,760
They were smart politicians and they saw that Maximus could
have an interesting future in Rome.

223
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
The real power was not with the Emperor.

224
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,600
It was with whoever had control of the army.

225
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Commodus led Maximus away to a quieter corner.

226
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
He spoke softly.

227
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,840
"Times are changing, General. I'm going to need good men
like you."

228
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,920
"How can I help, sir?"

229
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:46,240
"You're a man who can command. You give orders, the men follow your orders, the battle is won." Commodus looked
across at the senators.

230
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:54,360
"We must save Rome from the politicians, my friend. Will you
be with me when the time comes?"

231
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:02,080
"When your father allows me to go, I will return to Spain,
sir," said Maximus.

232
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:27,240
"Home? Ah yes. But don't get too comfortable-I may call on you soon." Then, seeming suddenly to remember, Commodus
said, "Lucilla is here. Did you know? She hasn't forgotten you- and now you are the great hero." He turned away to watch his father leaving the tent with his guards.

233
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,280
"Caesar will sleep early tonight," he said.

234
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,720
When he turned back again, Maximus had gone.

235
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,280
Commodus was anxious.

236
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,840
Who did the great general really support?

237
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,880
Could he be trusted?

238
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,840
Commodus took some more wine and thought carefully about
Maximus.

239
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,840
Marcus's slaves helped him into the royal tent.

240
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,160
Lucilla was already there.

241
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,080
"It's a pity I only have one son," Marcus said to her.

242
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:13,920
"You would be a better Caesar than Commodus... stronger. I
wonder if you would also be fair?"

243
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,400
"I would be whatever you taught me to be," she replied,
smiling.

244
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,680
She came to his side and kissed him.

245
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,680
"How was the trip?" Marcus asked.

246
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,640
"Long. Boring. Why have I come?" asked Lucilla.

247
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,200
"I need your help," said her father.

248
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:49,960
"With your brother. He loves you-he always has. Soon he is going to need you more than ever." Lucilla did not know what
to say.

249
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,480
"No more. It is not a night for politics," Marcus said.

250
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:11,040
"It is a night for an old man and his daughter to look at the moon together. Let us pretend that you are a loving
daughter and I am a good father."

251
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,600
Lucilla took his arm and they walked together into the cold
night air.

252
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,480
"This is a pleasant fiction" she said, smiling at him.

253
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,680
Lucilla understood him.

254
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,280
She knew that her father would love to be just a simple old
man sharing a little time with his daughter.

255
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:40,960
But he was Emperor of Rome, and for him life was much more
complicated.

256
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,960
In the cold morning, at the edge of the forest, a group of
men were training for battle.

257
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,600
Commodus and his guards were practicing sword fighting,
striking at small trees.

258
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,800
The young prince was proud of his body.

259
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,040
He was strong and healthy as a result of the strict training
he did every morning.

260
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,280
His training program was taken straight from the gladiator
schools, where men learned to fight for their lives.

261
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,680
His greatest wish was to fight against real gladiators,
although he knew that his father would never allow it.

262
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,560
Marcus had ended the tradition of gladiator fights in Rome.

263
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:31,120
Maximus passed by the small group of men in the early
morning light and noticed that the Emperor's son was among
them.

264
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,560
He was not surprised.

265
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,920
He had heard plenty of stories about Commodus, how strong
and skilled he was.

266
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,400
He had also heard that Commodus was a cruel man, but he
tried not to believe that.

267
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,640
There were always jealous people saying bad things about the
royal family.

268
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,440
Maximus walked to Marcus's tent.

269
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,440
The Emperor's guards let him through the entrance without
any questions.

270
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,600
They were expecting him.

271
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,480
CHAPTER THREE

272
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,360
One More Duty

273
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,880
The only light in the Emperor's tent came from oil lamps.

274
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,840
Marcus sat with his back to Maximus.

275
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,080
He was writing his diary and at first he did not realize
Maximus had arrived.

276
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,160
"Caesar. You sent for me," said Maximus.

277
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,800
Marcus, lost in his thoughts, did not reply.

278
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,880
"Caesar?" Maximus repeated.

279
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,680
"Tell me again, Maximus," Marcus said.

280
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,280
"Why are we here?"

281
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,960
"For the glory of the Empire, sir."

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
At first he thought Marcus had not heard him.

283
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:58,000
Then Marcus slowly got up from his desk and softly said,
"Yes, I remember..."

284
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,240
He walked over to a large map of the Roman Empire and waved
a hand across it.

285
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:23,600
"Do you see it, Maximus? This is the world I have made. For twenty years I have tried to be a student of life and of
men-but what have I really done?" He touched the map.

286
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:43,960
"For twenty years I have fought and won battles. I have defended the Empire and increased it. Since I became Caesar
I have only had four years of peace. And for what?"

287
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,920
"To make our borders safe," said Maximus.

288
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,960
"To bring teaching and law."

289
00:24:49,960 --> 00:25:09,840
"I brought the sword! Nothing more! And while I have fought,
Rome has grown fat and diseased. I did this. And nothing can change the fact that Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here."

290
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,600
"But Caesar ..." Maximus started, but Marcus interrupted
him.

291
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,200
"Don't call me that," he said.

292
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:26,880
"We have to talk together now. Very simply. Just as men. Can
we do that?"

293
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,040
"Forty thousand of my men are out there now, freezing in the
mud," said Maximus.

294
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,920
"Eight thousand are wounded and two thousand will never leave this place. I won't believe they fought and died for
nothing."

295
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,000
"What do you believe, Maximus?"

296
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,680
"That they fought for you-and for Rome," he replied.

297
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,080
"And what is Rome, Maximus? Tell me."

298
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:04,040
"I've seen too much of the rest of the world and I know it's
cruel and dark. I have to believe that Rome is the light."

299
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,560
"But you have never been there," said Marcus.

300
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,560
"You have not seen Rome as it is now."

301
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,040
Maximus had heard stories about Rome.

302
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,680
People in the cities were hungry and food prices were much
too high.

303
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,960
Some Romans had become very rich, but most were poor.

304
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,280
Bridges, roads, and ports all needed repairs, while tax
money went into the pockets of the rich.

305
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,760
There were many things wrong at the heart of the enormous
empire.

306
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:50,400
"I am dying, Maximus. And I want to see that there has been
some purpose to my life." Marcus sat down again.

307
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:08,760
"It's strange. I think more about the future than the present. How will the world speak my name in future years?"
He held out his hand to Maximus, who took it and came to sit next to Marcus.

308
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,360
"You have a son," said the Emperor.

309
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,760
"You must love him very much. Tell me about your home"

310
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,640
"The house is in the hills above Trujillo," Maximus began.

311
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:42,400
"It's a simple place, pink stones that warm in the sun. There's a wall, a gate, and a small field of vegetables."
Maximus looked up and saw that the old man had closed his eyes as he listened.

312
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
He was smiling.

313
00:27:44,000 --> 00:28:01,600
"Through the gate are apple trees. The earth is black, Marcus. As black as my wife's hair. And we grow fruit and
vegetables. There are wild horses near the house-my son loves them."

314
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,720
"How long is it since you were last home?"

315
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,760
"Two years, two hundred sixty-four days-and one morning."

316
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,120
Marcus laughed.

317
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:30,880
"I am jealous of you, Maximus. Your home is good-something to fight for. I have one more duty to ask of you before you
go home."

318
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,160
"What would you like me to do, Caesar?"

319
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:51,560
"Before I die, I will give the people a final gift. An empire at peace should not be ruled by one man. I want to
give power back to the Senate."

320
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,520
Maximus was shocked.

321
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:01,720
"But sir, if no one man holds power, all men will reach for
it"

322
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:17,480
"You're right. That is why I want you to become the Protector of Rome. Give power back to the people of Rome."
Maximus said nothing.

323
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,160
"You don't want this great honor?"

324
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,000
"With all my heart, no."

325
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,200
"That is why it must be you," Marcus replied.

326
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,360
"But what about Commodus?"

327
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:53,960
"Commodus is not a good man. I think you already know that. He must not rule. You are more of a son to me than he is."
Marcus stood up.

328
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,440
"Commodus will accept my decision-he knows the army is loyal
to you."

329
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,160
A piece of ice struck Maximus's heart.

330
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,040
"I need some time sir" he said.

331
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:26,160
"Of course. By sunrise tomorrow I hope your answer will be yes. Now let me hold you as a son." Marcus put his arms
around Maximus.

332
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,480
Maximus left the Emperor's tent feeling anxious.

333
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,800
One more duty, one he did not want-but could he refuse?

334
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,400
He was a loyal soldier, loyal to Rome and to Caesar.

335
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,840
He stood outside the tent trying to think clearly.

336
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,000
Suddenly, there was a voice behind him.

337
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,760
"You are my father's favorite now."

338
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,680
Maximus turned and saw Lucilla.

339
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,040
As their eyes met, a shock of emotion ran through them both.

340
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,920
"It was not always true," said Lucilla.

341
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:14,480
"Many things have changed since we last met," said Maximus,
and he turned to walk away.

342
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,080
"What did my father want with you?"

343
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,480
'To wish me luck, before I leave for Spain," he replied,

344
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:29,080
"You're lying," said Lucilla. "I could always tell when you
were lying.

345
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
You're not very good at it."

346
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,520
"I was never as good as you, my lady."

347
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,880
Lucilla did not try to deny it.

348
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,760
Again, Maximus tried to leave.

349
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,680
"Maximus, please... is it really so terrible to see me
again?"

350
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,360
"No, I'm sorry. I'm tired from battle," he said.

351
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:08,600
"And you're upset to see my father so weak. Commodus expects our father to name him in a few days as the next Caesar.
Will you be as loyal to him as you have been to Marcus?"

352
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:16,120
This was a difficult question, but Maximus never forgot that
he was talking to one of the royal family.

353
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,000
"I will always be loyal to Rome," he said.

354
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,280
"Do you know I still remember you when I speak to the gods?"
said Lucilla, smiling.

355
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:36,200
"I was sorry to hear of your husband's death, I understand
you have a son."

356
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,920
"Yes," said Lucilla.

357
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,360
"Lucius. He's almost eight years old."

358
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,080
"I, too, have a son who is eight years old."

359
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,800
They smiled at each other again.

360
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,760
"I thank you for your kind thoughts," said Maximus, and then
he walked slowly back to his tent.

361
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,280
Lucilla watched him go.

362
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Her thoughts were confused, and her emotions reminded her
that she had once loved this man.

363
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:14,360
Maximus sat in front of a low table in his tent.

364
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,520
On the table were small wooden figures of his family-parents
and grandparents.

365
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,320
In the center, protected by the others, were the two
smallest figures.

366
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,200
These were his wife and child.

367
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,800
As he looked at his family, he tried to imagine what his
father or grandfather would do in his situation.

368
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,920
What would they decide?

369
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
How would they advise him?

370
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,360
He picked up the figure of his wife and kissed it.

371
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,640
"Cicero," he called out.

372
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,600
Behind him, his servant Cicero appeared and gave him a
drink.

373
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,480
"Do you ever find it difficult to do your duty?" Maximus
asked him.

374
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,120
Cicero, a tall, thin man with long hair, thought about the
question for a few seconds.

375
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,760
"Sometimes I do what I want to do, sir," he said.

376
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,080
"The rest of the time I do what I have to do."

377
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,360
Maximus smiled.

378
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,440
"We may not be able to go home," he said, sadly.

379
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:31,840
Marcus Aurelius sat in his great tent, lit only by the light of a fire, and prepared himself to tell Commodus of his
decision.

380
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,720
Finally, he said, "You will do your duty for Rome."

381
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,320
Commodus stood in front of him, proud and tall, waiting to
hear his father name him as the next Caesar.

382
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,960
"Yes, Father," he said.

383
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,600
"But you will not be Emperor," Marcus said.

384
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,760
Commodus froze as his future suddenly disappeared.

385
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,480
"Who will take my place?" he asked.

386
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:06,960
"My power will pass to Maximus, to hold until the Senate is ready to rule. Rome will be a republic again. I can see that
you are not happy, my son..."

387
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
"You break my heart," Commodus said.

388
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:27,920
"I have tried to make you proud... but I could never do it. Why do you hate me so much? I only wanted to be your son,
but I was never quite good enough." Marcus put his arms around his son, and Commodus cried.

389
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,160
"Why does Maximus deserve this instead of me? Why do you
love him more than me?"

390
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,960
His voice grew louder as he held his father's head tighter
and tighter.

391
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Marcus could not breathe.

392
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,520
He began to move, trying to get away, but Commodus held his
father's face close against his chest.

393
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,200
His strength was too great; Marcus could not escape.

394
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,760
Commodus did not relax until he felt his father's body drop
in his arms.

395
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,640
He placed him on the bed, dead.

396
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,920
"You didn't love me enough," he said softly.

397
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,520
Quintus woke Maximus in the middle of the night.

398
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,120
Maximus realized immediately that there was trouble.

399
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,920
"The Emperor needs you," Quintus said.

400
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
"It's urgent."

401
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,440
"What is it?" Maximus asked.

402
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,440
"They did not tell me," said Quintus.

403
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
They hurried to Marcus's tent together.

404
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,240
At the entrance, the guards let them through without a word.

405
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:28,120
Inside, Maximus saw Commodus first.

406
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,840
His face was white but showed no emotion.

407
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,160
Lucilla stood in a corner of the tent, looking down at the
floor.

408
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,360
Then Maximus saw Marcus, lying on his bed.

409
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,640
He knew immediately that he was dead.

410
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,200
"How did he die?" he asked.

411
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,520
"In his sleep," said Commodus.

412
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,840
"The doctors say there was no pain."

413
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,160
Maximus looked at Lucilla, but she turned away.

414
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,200
He walked to the bed, bent over Marcus, and kissed the top
of his head.

415
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,280
Then he stood and faced Commodus.

416
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,400
Commodus looked back at him and held out his hand.

417
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,040
"Your Emperor asks for your loyalty," he said.

418
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:20,960
"Take my hand, Maximus." Maximus understood the situation
exactly.

419
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,840
He knew, without a doubt, that Commodus had killed his
father.

420
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,440
"I shall only offer it once," said Commodus.

421
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,920
Maximus walked past him and out of the tent.

422
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,880
Quintus already had his orders from the new Caesar.

423
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,200
Commodus looked across at him and he followed his general
out into the night.

424
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,120
Lucilla bent over her father and kissed him.

425
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,640
Then she turned to her brother.

426
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,760
Their eyes met.

427
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,880
She hit his face twice, hard.

428
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,680
He stepped back, shocked.

429
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,000
Then she took his right hand, lifted it to her lips, and
kissed it.

430
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,760
"I greet you, Caesar," Lucilla said without emotion.

431
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,720
Back in his own tent, Maximus called to Cicero.

432
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,600
"I must talk to the senators," he said.

433
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,600
"Wake Gaius and Falco! I need their advice."

434
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:29,760
Quintus arrived just then, and caught the servants arm to
stop him.

435
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,240
"Maximus, please be careful..."

436
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,160
"Careful? The Emperor was murdered!" said Maximus.

437
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,840
"No," said Quintus.

438
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,800
"The Emperor died in his sleep."

439
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:56,360
Maximus looked toward the entrance of the tent and saw four
royal guards with their swords ready.

440
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,640
They came in and quickly tied his hands and arms.

441
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,200
"Please don't fight, Maximus," said Quintus.

442
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,520
"I'm sorry. . . Caesar has spoken."

443
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,720
Maximus understood.

444
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,120
Quintus was a soldier, and his orders had come from the top.

445
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
He had to obey.

446
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,040
"Quintus... promise me you'll look after my family" said
Maximus.

447
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:30,600
"Your family will greet you in the next world," Quintus
said, quietly.

448
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,480
Maximus jumped at him in anger.

449
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:44,640
One of the guards hit the prisoner on the back of the head
with the handle of his sword and Maximus fell to the ground.

450
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,200
"Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him," said
Quintus.

451
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,440
It was nearly sunrise, and the five horses on the forest
road had not passed anybody for several hours.

452
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,880
Here there was nothing- no help, no hope.

453
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:08,840
"All right, this is far enough," said Cornelius, the oldest
of the guards and their leader.

454
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,320
"Take him down there. No one will ever find him."

455
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:20,840
Two of the guards climbed from their horses and pulled
Maximus from his horse.

456
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,000
His hands were still tied in front of him.

457
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,000
Cornelius searched in his bag for something to eat.

458
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,840
He would make sure the orders from Caesar were obeyed but he
did not want to have Roman blood on his hands.

459
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,960
The other man, Salvius, stayed with the three horses.

460
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,800
The two guards led Maximus down the hill.

461
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,280
They thought he had given up the fight, but he was like a
cat watching a mouse.

462
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,240
He could see they were young and their armor was still new.

463
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,320
These were royal guards-they almost never left Rome and they
did not usually go into battle.

464
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,320
They were not experienced fighters.

465
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,200
"This is good enough," said one of them.

466
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,920
"On your knees."

467
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,080
Behind Maximus, one of the guards was ready with his sword
to cut off his head.

468
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:20,320
The second guard stood facing Maximus.

469
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,080
Maximus sunk to his knees and closed his eyes.

470
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:34,880
As the sword came down, he turned very quickly and caught it
between his hands.

471
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,000
Then he brought the handle of the sword up into the guards
face.

472
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,640
In the next second he turned again and struck the sword
through the other guard.

473
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,720
As he got to his feet and turned back to the first man, he
saw his chance and pushed the sword through his body.

474
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,520
On the road above, Cornelius and Salvius were waiting on
their horses.

475
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,920
They heard a cry from below, and then it was quiet again.

476
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,600
Cornelius sent Salvius down to make certain Maximus was
dead.

477
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,000
The guard rode down the hill but saw nothing of his friends.

478
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,200
Suddenly, he felt there was someone behind him.

479
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,480
He turned in time to see Maximus's sword as it flew through
the air toward him and landed in his chest.

480
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,600
He fell to his death.

481
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,760
Cornelius was still on his horse, eating his bread and meat.

482
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,840
He heard some noises below, moved across the road, and
looked down into the trees.

483
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,040
With no sound at all Maximus came onto the road behind him.

484
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,040
"Guard!" he shouted.

485
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,960
Cornelius turned around and rode toward Maximus at full
speed, his sword ready.

486
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,440
As they met, Maximus struck his sword upward and back.

487
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,240
It cut right through Cornelius's body.

488
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,480
Cornelius fell off his horse and lay down to die.

489
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,880
But Maximus had also been wounded, with a deep cut to his
shoulder from Cornelius's sword.

490
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,840
He fought the pain and moved toward the horses.

491
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,360
CHAPTER FOUR

492
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,040
A Prisoner Again

493
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:15,240
Maximus rode fast through the German forests on Cornelius's
horse.

494
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,120
He was leading one of the other horses behind him.

495
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,600
He had put a cloth around the cut in his shoulder, but it
was bad and gave him a lot of pain.

496
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,320
Blood ran down his arm as he rode, but he did not have time
to stop.

497
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,760
By the middle of the day he had crossed into the east of
France.

498
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,400
He rode his horse as hard as he could-he had to get home
before it was too late.

499
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,720
Into the night he continued riding, not stopping for water,
food, or rest.

500
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,160
He saw nothing as he passed through the country and he
remembered nothing.

501
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,920
He could only think that time was passing so quickly.

502
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,120
He became hot and tired and decided to throw off his armor.

503
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,400
His horse was also tired, and he knew it could not go much
further.

504
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,520
He changed horses and continued his urgent flight toward
Spain and the faraway hills above Trujillo.

505
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:16,520
In the light of early day, the Spanish hills around the farm
and house were unbelievably beautiful.

506
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,080
An eight-year-old boy with dark hair was in a field beside
the pink stone house.

507
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,680
He was training a wild horse, making it walk around the
field.

508
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,880
A beautiful, black-haired woman watched her son working with
the horse and smiled.

509
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,120
He would have a fine riding horse by the time his father
returned.

510
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,120
The boy stopped-he saw something.

511
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,600
Over a hill he could just see a battle flag, coming in their
direction.

512
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,560
He shouted with excitement and happiness and ran out of the
field.

513
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,600
He ran toward the flag, calling, "Father! Father!"

514
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,480
The woman, too, looked toward the flag.

515
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,520
But there was something about it that worried her.

516
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,120
Something was not right, and she suddenly felt anxious.

517
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,320
The boy continued to run along the road.

518
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,720
Soon soldiers appeared over the hill.

519
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,120
But they were not the Roman soldiers he expected to see.

520
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,680
He slowed down, then stopped, confused.

521
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,600
Twenty royal guards were riding down the road, and his
father was not among them.

522
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,560
He searched their faces again, looking for his father,
hoping.

523
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,200
Behind him his mother started shouting out his name.

524
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,560
The horses suddenly came faster, riding over the small boy
and crashing him into the dirt of the road.

525
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,080
Then they rode straight toward his screaming mother.

526
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:50,880
At the hills turned pink and gold with the sunset, a rider
raced for his life killing the horse under him.

527
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,800
His shoulder was bleeding badly.

528
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,640
He came to the top of a long, low hill and stopped.

529
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:03,400
There was a line of thick, black smoke in the distance and
he tried to see where it was coming from.

530
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,040
With a cry of pain he forced the horse forward, racing down
the far side of the hill.

531
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,880
Would he arrive in time?

532
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,240
Maximus's worst dream did not equal the sight in front of
him.

533
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,120
His family home and farm were burning, completely destroyed.

534
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,280
The wheat and the apple trees were burnt black, and smoke
still curved upward from the last stones of his house.

535
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,400
Two pink stone chimneys were left standing-nothing else.

536
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,760
He stopped the horse violently.

537
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,200
It fell over onto its side and Maximus was thrown off.

538
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,960
His stomach was sick with fear.

539
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,680
He knew now what he would find.

540
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:56,000
He stopped before the field of vegetables, looked up, and
forced himself to breathe.

541
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,120
There, hanging on ropes, were the burnt bodies of his wife
and son.

542
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,280
There was almost nothing left of them.

543
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,720
He reached up with both hands to touch his wife's feet.

544
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,840
A terrible scream came from him, and he sank to the earth.

545
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,880
His world was now dead.

546
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,800
Maximus dug one deep hole in the black earth on the hillside
for his wife and son.

547
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,600
He pushed the earth back over their broken, burnt bodies and
cried.

548
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:40,720
He looked down toward the ruin of the house he had built, to
the dead apple trees.

549
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,600
He spoke to his loved ones through his tears.

550
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:52,120
"Lie in the shadow of the trees, my loves, and wait for me
there..."

551
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,440
He fell onto the earth beside them.

552
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,920
They came because they had smelled the smoke in the air.

553
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,440
Fire meant there was something to be found and taken.

554
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,840
These were Spanish thieves, and their chief was a big
mountain man with a black beard.

555
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,560
They found the man lying dead on the black earth.

556
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,080
Hands touched his shoes-expensive, leather shoes.

557
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,720
Other hands moved over his soldiers clothes-fine, dark red
cloth.

558
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,040
Suddenly, the dead man moved.

559
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,600
The hands on his body stopped.

560
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,080
Something was said in a strange language.

561
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,680
Everyone waited.

562
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,360
The big man on the ground did not move again.

563
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,800
The chief made a sign to his men, and the hands roughly took
hold of Maximus and pulled him away.

564
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:54,280
Days and nights passed, and for Maximus it was like a never-
ending feverish dream.

565
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,640
Terrible pictures crossed his mind as he lay close to death
in the open carriage they had thrown him into.

566
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,120
He dreamed of wild animals, close to his face... then he was
on a ship, traveling across water.

567
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:17,000
A large African man smiled down at him ... he saw views of the desert... far-away mountains... heard shouts in a
strange language.

568
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,160
It was hot, too hot to breathe...

569
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,760
Maximus's eyes opened slowly.

570
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:33,640
Centimeters away from his face was a wild tiger-and this one did not go away when he closed his eyes and opened them
again.

571
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:41,040
He looked around and realized that he was one of several men
chained together in a dirty slave carriage.

572
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,280
There were small windows at the front and back and on both
sides.

573
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,840
He looked through one of the windows and saw other carriages
traveling with them.

574
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,000
Wild animals in chains were walking along with them, some
close to the window that he was looking through.

575
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,320
He fell back onto the floor, thinking, "This must all be a
terrible dream."

576
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:09,680
When Maximus woke again, he saw twelve slaves, all chained
together, all looking at him.

577
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,400
Outside the carriage he could hear men talking in a language
he did not understand.

578
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,480
Someone was looking down at him, a big African man.

579
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,640
"Juba," said the African, giving his name.

580
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,720
He, too, was chained.

581
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:31,760
Maximus moved with great pain and saw that the sword wound
on his shoulder was worse than he had realized.

582
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,880
Juba was putting something on the wound.

583
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,760
Maximus fell back again and slept.

584
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,560
When he woke again, the African was still with him.

585
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,520
"You see?" he said.

586
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:51,040
"Now your arm is getting better-it's clean." He put his
finger gently on the wound.

587
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,480
"Don't die," said Juba.

588
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,560
"They'll feed you to the tigers. They're more expensive than
we are."

589
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,360
Maximus stared at him, and Juba looked down with a small
smile on his lips.

590
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:12,280
The desert heat of Morocco was not like anything that
Maximus had known.

591
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,800
The hot air made breathing difficult.

592
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,800
He did not care about breathing, though.

593
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,920
Maximus did not care about anything.

594
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,640
All around him men were standing in the sand in a slave
market.

595
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,080
The buyers walked slowly around, looking at the men and
touching them.

596
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,760
There was a man with a black beard standing near them,
calling out to tell people about his slaves.

597
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,360
Maximus stood with the others, looking far away, beyond the
people and the market.

598
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,040
Physically, he was getting better with Juba's help.

599
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,360
But nobody could help the darkness inside him.

600
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,400
He did not even care about his own life.

601
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,720
Maximus the Roman

602
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,240
General, Maximus the farmer and husband was already dead.

603
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:09,240
Across the market square Aelius Proximo sat in a small,
dirty cafe and watched everything with interest.

604
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,080
Proximo was a large man with big, blue eyes and white hair
and beard.

605
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,520
He looked like a man who enjoyed the good things in life.

606
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,480
He drank his tea slowly, as a man measured his feet for new
shoes.

607
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,600
Two slave girls sat beside him.

608
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,080
"Proximo, my friend!" said the man with the black beard.

609
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,760
Proximo recognized the man immediately and turned away.

610
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,720
"Every day you are here is a great day," the man said,
smiling.

611
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,800
He came to sit with Proximo.

612
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,440
"And today is your lucky day"

613
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,440
Proximo caught hold of his arm and held it tight.

614
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:58,120
"It wasn't my lucky day the last time you sold me some animals. They're no good-they only run around and eat. Give
me my money back!"

615
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,080
The slave-seller tried to pull his arm away.

616
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:10,240
"I'll give you a special price today-because you are
unhappy. Just for you. Come and see the new tigers."

617
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,320
Proximo let him go and followed him across the square.

618
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,880
"Look at this one," said the man.

619
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,000
"Isn't he a beauty?"

620
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,360
Proximo looked at the tigers through the bars.

621
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,080
"Do they fight?" he asked.

622
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:33,120
"Of course! For you, my special price, only eight thousand."

623
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,640
"For me," said Proximo, "four thousand. That's my special
price."

624
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,000
"Four? I have to eat..."

625
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,800
Proximo looked around at the group of men in chains.

626
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,280
"Do any of them fight?" he said.

627
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,360
"There's a contest soon."

628
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:59,120
"Some are good for fighting, some for dying. You need both."

629
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,160
Proximo walked over to Juba.

630
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,640
"Get up," he commanded the big African.

631
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,560
Juba lifted his head and looked at him.

632
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,160
He got up slowly.

633
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,800
Proximo looked at him carefully.

634
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,040
He turned over Juba's hands and felt the hard skin.

635
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,880
Then he moved on to Maximus.

636
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:35,200
He saw the wound on his arm and then he saw the mark just above it-the letters "SPQR." Proximo knew that they meant
Senatus Populusque Romanus: The Senate and the Roman People.

637
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,880
"A soldier," said Proximo.

638
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,360
"Did you run away?" he asked Maximus.

639
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,440
But Maximus said nothing.

640
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,840
"Probably," said the slave-seller.

641
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,760
"They say he's a Spaniard."

642
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,520
Proximo walked on and looked at the others.

643
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,880
"I'll take six-a thousand for all of them," he said.

644
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,640
His servant handed him a small brush with red paint on it.

645
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,000
"A thousand!" the slave-seller cried.

646
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:15,520
"The African alone should cost two thousand." He whispered
to Proximo, "Turn your back on him, he'll kill you."

647
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,400
"These slaves are no good," said Proximo, as he walked away.

648
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,120
"Wait, wait... we can discuss the price."

649
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:30,680
Proximo made a mark in red paint on the chests of the slaves
he had chosen.

650
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:39,400
"I'll give you two thousand," he said, "and four for the
animals. But it will be five thousand for an old friend."

651
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,520
The slave-seller thought for a second and then accepted.

652
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,760
"But those tigers have to fight," said Proximo.

653
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:54,400
"Don't feed them for a day and a half," said the
slave-seller, "and they'll eat their own mothers."

654
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,320
"Interesting idea," said Proximo, as he walked away.

655
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,720
His servants pulled the chains tied to Juba, Maximus, and
the others, and they were led away.

656
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:11,920
Proximo's carriages arrived in a crowded, Moroccan port
city.

657
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,240
Maximus and Juba sat together with twelve other new slaves.

658
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,920
One was a small, very frightened Greek man.

659
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,520
He was probably a teacher or a writer.

660
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,280
He was definitely not a fighter.

661
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,280
The carriage of slaves was followed by several others
carrying wild animals-including the tigers.

662
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,480
Most of the chained men looked back at the tigers from time
to time, not with interest but with fear.

663
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:46,040
They knew what a hungry tiger could do, and they guessed why
they and the animals had been bought together.

664
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,640
They drove through some large iron gates.

665
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:57,320
There was no sign on the gates or on the buildings inside,
but everyone in the city knew the place as Proximo's School.

666
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,720
It was not a place to learn Latin, Greek, or mathematics.

667
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:08,120
It was a school where men learned how to fight-to live one
more day in the face of death.

668
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,040
It was a gladiator school.

669
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,320
Proximo's school was like a castle prison.

670
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,200
In the center was a square.

671
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,480
On one side were the cages for the animals, and on the
opposite side the human prisoners were kept.

672
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:30,320
Maximus and the other new slaves were pushed into their
prison, and the doors crashed shut behind them.

673
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,560
Maximus noticed the guards.

674
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,520
They all carried short swords and some also had arrows or
spears.

675
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,640
At the far end of the square a group of about ten men were
training.

676
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,080
"Battle practice," thought Maximus.

677
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,920
"Like Commodus."

678
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:53,080
A very big man was teaching two new gladiators how to throw
a spear.

679
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:57,240
They were trying to hit a picture of a man, but they were
not very good.

680
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,000
Both students missed it.

681
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,720
The teacher threw his spear and hit the picture in the
stomach.

682
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,880
"Haken," said a voice from behind, naming the teacher.

683
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,840
Maximus turned to see Proximo, who was admiring Haken's
strength.

684
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,240
He and Maximus stared at each other.

685
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,200
"Spaniard..." Proximo said, naming Maximus.

686
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,080
Then he moved along the line, naming each new slave.

687
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,520
"Thief... murderer..."

688
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,360
Suddenly, he stopped and smiled.

689
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,200
"Proximo!" he said.

690
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,240
"Anyone know the meaning of that?"

691
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,920
'Nearest.'

692
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,640
'Dearest.'

693
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,320
'Close to.'

694
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,040
'I am Proximo.

695
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,840
I shall be closer to you in the next days than your own
mothers were.

696
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:51,160
I did not pay good money to buy you," Proximo said. "I paid
to buy your death.

697
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,560
You may die alone, in pairs, or in groups-who knows?

698
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,240
Many different ways with just one ending."

699
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,360
He walked around his new slaves, enjoying himself.

700
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:14,640
"And when you die-and you will die-the sound of cheering
will send you to the next world."

701
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,760
Proximo raised his hands and stretched them out to the group
of slaves.

702
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,160
"Gladiators, I salute you," he said.

703
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,520
CHAPTER FIVE

704
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,360
New Gladiators

705
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,960
Proximo never missed training for the new boys.

706
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,680
He could learn so much about them.

707
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:47,160
The more experienced gladiators trained against each other,
working with swords and spears and with shields and armor.

708
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,080
The new ones were put together into a small arena in the
center.

709
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,400
One by one they were given heavy wooden swords and sent in
to face the teacher.

710
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,440
He had a similar sword.

711
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,840
Proximo watched from a short distance.

712
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,680
Very quickly his trained eye could sort the new class into
two groups.

713
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,520
The fighters were marked with red paint, and the others with
yellow.

714
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,600
Haken enjoyed his job as gladiator teacher.

715
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,560
He took great pleasure in knocking away the swords of his new students and then hitting them hard so they fell onto
the dirt.

716
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,080
It was soon Maximus's turn to face Haken.

717
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,920
"Spaniard," Haken called to him.

718
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,000
Maximus went forward slowly.

719
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,160
Proximo watched more closely, to see what would happen.

720
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,840
Maximus picked up the sword and stood facing Haken.

721
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,560
Suddenly everyone, especially Haken, saw that this man was a
fighter.

722
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:58,040
There was something about the way he held the sword, the way
he stood-but most of all there were his eyes.

723
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,600
There was no doubt-he knew how to fight.

724
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,240
Maximus lifted the sword and then dropped it to the ground.

725
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,640
He seemed to be saying, "I could kill, but I choose not to."

726
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,720
Haken was surprised.

727
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,400
Was this an insult?

728
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,240
He looked to Proximo for orders.

729
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,640
Proximo made a sign to him to continue.

730
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,160
Haken struck Maximus across the stomach.

731
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,080
Maximus fell forward but then stood straight again and faced
him.

732
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,360
Haken looked again to Proximo, and again he was told to
continue.

733
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,000
This time Haken struck Maximus across his wounded arm.

734
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,600
Maximus almost fell to the ground but managed to stay on his
feet.

735
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:54,160
All the time he stared straight at Haken, who was becoming
very angry.

736
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:05,000
Maximus's thoughts were clear: "I may be low, but I'm not as
low as you. I won't kill for sport."

737
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,160
Proximo found it very interesting.

738
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:15,560
Haken lifted the sword again, ready to hurt Maximus really
badly, but Proximo stopped him.

739
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,800
"That's enough for now" he said.

740
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:24,360
"His time will come." He looked behind him to the servant
with the pots of paint.

741
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,960
"Mark that one," he said.

742
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:37,760
In the heat of the late afternoon Haken, Juba, the Greek,
and the other new gladiators sat on the ground in the
shadows.

743
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,200
Maximus lay by the wall to one side.

744
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:48,600
He had a small, sharp stone and was using it to try to
remove the letters SPQR from his arm.

745
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:56,800
Juba called out to him, "Spaniard! Why didn't you fight? We
all have to fight."

746
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,760
Maximus did not answer.

747
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,720
The young Greek was very frightened.

748
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,720
"I don't fight," he said.

749
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:10,960
"I shouldn't be here. I'm a secretary-I can write in seven
languages."

750
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,400
"Good," said Haken.

751
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,000
"Tomorrow you can scream in seven languages."

752
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,080
The other gladiators laughed.

753
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:24,520
Juba moved closer to Maximus and watched him digging the
stone into his skin.

754
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:29,320
"Is that the sign of your gods?" he asked.

755
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,800
Maximus did not answer.

756
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,640
Behind them Haken was making fun of the Greek.

757
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,440
"Maybe the secretary will be the one who wins his freedom,"
he laughed.

758
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,600
"Freedom!" the Greek replied.

759
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,120
"What do I have to do?"

760
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:51,840
"You go into the arena and you kill me," Haken replied.

761
01:03:51,840 --> 01:04:00,200
"Then you kill him, and the African, and him, and a hundred
more. And when there are no more men to fight, you're free."

762
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,040
"I can't do that," cried the Greek.

763
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:17,040
"No," said Haken, suddenly serious, "but I can." He looked from one gladiator to the next until his eyes rested on
Maximus.

764
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,880
Maximus stared back at him, his face like stone.

765
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:29,400
Proximo and his gladiators walked through the streets of the
town on their way to the arena.

766
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,480
Haken and the gladiators were chained together, and
Proximo's guards walked with them.

767
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,000
They were all carrying short swords.

768
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,360
The arena was small.

769
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:47,960
It was not like the enormous Colosseum in Rome, although it
was there for the same reason-to entertain the people.

770
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:53,160
This arena was just a circle of sandy ground with a lot of
seats around it.

771
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:58,600
But the seats were filled with people, and the people were
expecting to see blood.

772
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:04,640
Maximus and the other gladiators were taken to a small area
behind the seats.

773
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:10,240
Above them were Proximo's seats, next to the seats of
several other gladiator trainers.

774
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:17,760
This special position gave the trainers a good view of the arena and they could also see the gladiators preparing to
fight.

775
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:24,040
They discussed their gladiators together before the contest
started-who would live and who would die.

776
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:29,680
"Has the African fought before?" one of the men asked
Proximo.

777
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,560
"No, first time."

778
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,120
"And that one?" he asked, pointing to Maximus.

779
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,960
"Soldier?"

780
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,240
"Him? He's no good," said Proximo.

781
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,920
"But I have an idea."

782
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,480
He called down to his guards.

783
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,080
"Chain the Spaniard to the African." he said.

784
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,680
The other man was not sure about Maximus.

785
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,080
He liked the look of the Spaniard.

786
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:04,240
"I think he'll live through this fight, you think he'll
die," he said.

787
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,000
"Let's put money on the result-a thousand?"

788
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,760
"Against my own man? I don't do that," said Proximo.

789
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,360
"And if I make it five thousand?"

790
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,120
Proximo thought about it.

791
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,360
That was a lot of money.

792
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:29,320
Proximo liked to see his new boys before they went to fight.

793
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,000
A guard called for silence as he walked into the waiting
area.

794
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:47,560
"Some of you are thinking that you won't fight," Proximo said, "and some that you can't fight. They all say that
until they're out there." He pulled a sword down from a shelf.

795
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:58,360
"Push this into another man and the crowd will cheer and love you. You may even begin to love them back." He stuck
the point of the sword in a table.

796
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:20,080
"In the end, we are all dead men. Sadly, we cannot choose how. But we can decide how we accept that end, so we are
remembered as men. You go out into the arena as slaves. You come back-if you come back-as gladiators."

797
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,600
Outside, the crowd was getting impatient.

798
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:30,200
Before he left, Proximo walked down the line of men, saying
who must be chained together.

799
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:37,720
They were all put in teams of two-and it soon became clear
that the method was to chain a "Red to a "Yellow."

800
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,000
Each good fighter was with a certain loser.

801
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,080
Haken was chained to the crying Greek secretary.

802
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:51,800
Maximus- a "loser" because he had refused to fight Haken-was
chained to Juba.

803
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,000
Maximus turned to look at the closed door.

804
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,440
From the other side they could hear the shouts of the crowd.

805
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:07,440
Suddenly, Maximus bent down and picked up a little sand from
the ground, then let it fall through his fingers.

806
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,160
Juba watched him but did not understand.

807
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,840
When Maximus stood up again, he looked different.

808
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,480
He was ready for battle.

809
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,240
Outside, the crowds were cheering and shouting.

810
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,840
There was the sound of drums.

811
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,320
Everyone stood anxiously waiting.

812
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:31,000
Suddenly, the doors to the arena crashed open and sunlight
poured in.

813
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,720
For a few seconds the men were blinded by it.

814
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:39,800
There were trained gladiators already in the arena, waiting,
their swords and spears ready for killing.

815
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,920
The new gladiators ran out, some to immediate death.

816
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,120
Side by side, their chain loose between them, Maximus and
Juba ran out into the arena.

817
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,800
It was not a fair fight.

818
01:08:52,920 --> 01:09:01,000
The new men had only one small sword and no armor; the
experienced gladiators had much better equipment.

819
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,080
Maximus and Juba fought together.

820
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:10,600
Juba was surprised to see that his partner-marked with the
yellow of cowards-was fighting bravely.

821
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:17,200
All the anger and pain inside Maximus had come out, and he
was better than any man in the arena.

822
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,560
He knew this was not his day to die, not like this.

823
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:26,600
Together they killed the first pair of gladiators.

824
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,680
Others came to fight them and, for a second, Juba lost his
sword as he attacked.

825
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,480
Maximus pulled him clear of the other man's sword and then
struck the attacker hard.

826
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,280
His sword point came out the man's back.

827
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,960
He and Juba worked together as a team.

828
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:47,040
They were strong and fast, and many of the attacking
gladiators were killed by them.

829
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,800
Haken fought with great power.

830
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:56,440
The Greek was soon killed, and Haken cut off the man's hand
so it was easier for him to move about in the arena.

831
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,320
Proximo watched everything closely.

832
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:07,760
The crowd quickly realized that Juba and Maximus were a
strong fighting pair and began to cheer them.

833
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,840
Soon all the attackers were on the ground.

834
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,800
Juba and Maximus looked around, and then at each other.

835
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,240
But then, as they began to relax, one of the gladiators
tried to get to his feet.

836
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,480
They ran forward together and pulled their chain tightly
around his neck.

837
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,160
The fighting had ended.

838
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,000
The crowd were on their feet, cheering.

839
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,280
Maximus looked at the many bodies around him, and then at
the excited faces of the crowd.

840
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,640
It made him sick that people were entertained by the sight
of men killing other men.

841
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,040
He walked toward the entrance and threw his sword into the
crowd.

842
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,720
It only made them cheer louder.

843
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,880
Proximo was pleased with the day's work.

844
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,760
He had lost a lot of money but he had found a new fighter.

845
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,880
CHAPTER SIX

846
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,800
Caesar's Arrival in Rome

847
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,240
It was a special day in Rome, a holiday.

848
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:16,280
Fifty black-armored royal guards marched down the main
street of Rome, followed by hundreds of men on horses.

849
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,640
Behind them came the royal carriage.

850
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,960
Commodus, the new Emperor of Rome, was coming home.

851
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,240
His sister Lucilla was sitting next to him.

852
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,080
Another fifty guards marched behind them.

853
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:35,520
Close to the royal carriage, on a beautiful black horse,
rode Quintus, the new Commander of the Royal Guards.

854
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:43,840
Commodus had told the Senate that he was now the Commander
of the Roman Army, and that the army was loyal to him.

855
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:50,000
Many senators doubted it, but there was no one in Rome with
enough power to take control.

856
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,280
And so nothing could stop Commodus.

857
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,120
The people had been told that their new Emperor would arrive
in Rome on this date, at this time.

858
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,920
The city was cleaned up and purple flags were hung outside
the most important buildings.

859
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:10,880
The citizens of Rome lined the streets at the time he was
expected.

860
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,040
The crowd was not very big and it was not very enthusiastic.

861
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,680
They cheered, but not loudly.

862
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:25,160
Commodus was young and had no experience, but the people
could forgive that.

863
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:31,080
They were more worried about the stories they had heard-that
Commodus was selfish and cruel.

864
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,200
He was not his father, and they had loved Marcus Aurelius.

865
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:41,840
Commodus had much work to do to make himself popular and win
the support of the people.

866
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:50,640
Ahead, on the steps of the Senate, a group of senators stood
waiting: Falco, Gaius, and Gracchus were among them.

867
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,040
Lucius, Lucilla's eight-year-old son, was standing with
them.

868
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:02,040
Senator Gracchus, a white-haired man in his sixties, was not
happy about the new Emperor.

869
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:09,680
"He is entering Rome like a hero-but what has he ever done?"
he said.

870
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,320
"Give him time, Gracchus," Falco answered.

871
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,120
"He's young. I think he could do very well."

872
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,680
"For Rome?" asked Gracchus.

873
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,360
"Or for you?"

874
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,880
Falco turned to Lucius.

875
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:31,520
"It's a proud day for all of us, isn't it, Lucius?" he said.

876
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,080
"I'm sure Senator Gracchus never thought he'd live to see
such a day."

877
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:43,040
Lucius watched as the royal carriage came closer, then ran
down the steps when it arrived.

878
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,440
He jumped up into his mother's arms and she held him tight
and kissed him.

879
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:54,960
Commodus raised his arm in salute to the crowd, but he could see that the crowd was small and the cheering was only
polite.

880
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,600
"Rome greets her new Emperor," Falco said.

881
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,600
"Your loyal people are here to welcome you, sir."

882
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:13,920
"Thank you, Falco," replied Commodus, "for bringing out the loyal people. I hope they weren't too expensive." He turned
to Gracchus.

883
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,240
"Ah, Gracchus," he said.

884
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,280
"The friend of Rome."

885
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,880
"We are happy that you are home, Caesar," Gracchus said.

886
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,560
Then he became more serious.

887
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:32,320
"There are many problems that need your attention."

888
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,920
In the royal palace Commodus was meeting with the senators.

889
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,040
He was following his sister's advice and listening to them
patiently.

890
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,880
Senator Gracchus had a list of problems in the city.

891
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:58,280
He was anxious that Commodus look at them without delay. "... and here are some suggestions from the Senate-ideas for
solving the problems," he said.

892
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,000
Commodus walked around the room, losing interest.

893
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,440
Lucilla listened carefully-and watched her brother.

894
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,800
Finally, Commodus could not listen any longer.

895
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,360
"You see Gracchus, this is exactly the problem," he
interrupted.

896
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,480
"My father spent too much time listening to the Senate, and
the people were forgotten."

897
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,840
"The Senate is the people, Caesar," said Gracchus.

898
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,520
"Chosen from among the people, to speak for the people."

899
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:39,040
"I doubt many of the people eat as well as you do, Gracchus. Or have the beautiful home you have, Gaius. I think I
understand my own people." Commodus said.

900
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:46,760
"Would Caesar kindly teach us, from his own great
experience?" replied Gracchus.

901
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:55,640
"I call it love, Gracchus. I am their father. The people are
my children," said Commodus.

902
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,400
He was getting angry.

903
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,720
Lucilla stepped forward.

904
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,920
"Senators, my brother is very tired," she said.

905
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:11,800
"Please leave your list with me. Caesar will do everything
that Rome needs." She called for a slave to show them out.

906
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,680
The senators left, but they were not pleased.

907
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,480
It was not a good start for the new Emperor.

908
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,800
When they had gone, Lucilla turned to Commodus.

909
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,920
"The Senate can be useful," she said.

910
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,840
"How?" he replied.

911
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:34,160
"They only talk" He moved to a window and looked out over
the great city.

912
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,960
"It should be just you, and me, and Rome."

913
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,160
"There has always been a Senate..." said Lucilla.

914
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,040
"Rome has changed," he answered.

915
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,440
"It takes an emperor to rule an empire."

916
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,480
"Of course, but leave the people their traditions."

917
01:16:53,480 --> 01:17:01,280
It had been a "tradition" for the last two hundred years to
believe that the Senate ruled Rome, through the Emperor.

918
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,400
But everyone knew the real situation.

919
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:10,920
The army held the political power in Rome, and the real
ruler was whoever the army was loyal to.

920
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:15,120
Commodus's thoughts were moving ahead.

921
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:27,920
"All the years of my father's wars gave the people nothing-but still they loved him. Why? They didn't see the
battles. They knew nothing of the people we fought and killed, or their countries," he said.

922
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,600
"They care about the greatness of Rome," said Lucilla.

923
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,120
"And what is that? Can I touch it, see it?"

924
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:41,800
"It's an idea. It's something they want to believe in," said
Lucilla.

925
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,000
Commodus was suddenly excited.

926
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:52,600
"I'll give them something to believe in-I'll give them great ideas. And they'll love me for it," he said, raising his
arms to the sky.

927
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,680
"I will give them the greatest ideas, the most wonderful
Rome ever!"

928
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:05,640
There were artists at work in the streets, painting enormous
pictures on walls.

929
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:12,960
Their pictures showed scenes of gladiators and wild animals fighting, and the sand on the floors of the arenas was red
with blood.

930
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,960
Crowds stood and stared, watching as the pictures were
completed.

931
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,600
This was the start of the advertising for Commodus's new
idea.

932
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:29,960
"Games!" Gaius complained to Gracchus and a group of other
senators as he joined them in a cafe.

933
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,960
"One hundred and fifty days of games!"

934
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:39,240
The senators watched the wall painters working outside the
cafe.

935
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,200
"He's smarter than I thought," said Gracchus, quietly.

936
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:48,200
"Smart?" said Gaius.

937
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:59,640
"All of Rome would laugh at him if they weren't so afraid of his guards. You can't really think that the people will
forget Rome's problems and sit back to enjoy these games?" he asked.

938
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,800
"It's completely mad."

939
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,560
"I think he knows what Rome is," Gracchus replied.

940
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:23,200
"He will give them magic, and then they'll have something else to think about. He will take their lives, and he will
take their freedom. And still they will shout and cheer." He shook his head, sadly.

941
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:36,520
"The beating heart of Rome isn't in the walls of the Senate. It's on the sand of the Colosseum. He will give them death.
And they will love him for it."

942
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:40,680
The other senators knew he was right.

943
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,800
It was a lesson from history.

944
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:48,560
But they did not know that Commodus was planning better and
longer games than any emperor before him.

945
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,080
And it was all for one reason.

946
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,480
Commodus knew he had no choice.

947
01:19:54,520 --> 01:20:00,960
He and the Senate did not agree about anything and he could
not be certain of their support.

948
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,600
So he had to look beyond the Senate and go straight to the
people for his power.

949
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,880
The games were the key.

950
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,880
As Lucilla had said, the people must have their traditions.

951
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,320
And he would not deny his citizens their traditional games.

952
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,280
Sitting behind the senators in the cafe, with his back to
them, was a small man.

953
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,680
None of the senators noticed him, but he was close enough to
hear everything they said.

954
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,040
The face of the listener was quite ordinary, except that his
right eye was missing.

955
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,400
He did not see well with only one eye, but he could hear
perfectly and he had a good memory.

956
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,840
He was able to collect a lot of information and he was paid
well to repeat it to other ears.

957
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,360
CHAPTER SEVEN

958
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:23,680
The Spaniard and the Crowd

959
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,880
Crowds of people came down the hillside from their small
houses above the Moroccan town.

960
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,880
They were all going toward the arena, hoping to put a little
excitement into their difficult lives.

961
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,560
Maximus's arm, now without the letters SPQR, was covered
with an arm guard.

962
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,760
He had earned the extra protection of armor because of his
brave fighting.

963
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:35,640
He bent and picked up some dirt from the ground, watched it disappear through his fingers, and walked quickly toward the
entrance to the arena.

964
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,040
Proximo walked with him.

965
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,520
"You just kill, kill, kill!" Proximo shouted at Maximus.

966
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:47,640
"You make it look too easy. The crowd wants a hero, not just someone cutting up meat. We want them to keep coming back.
Don't kill so quickly-take more time!" The cheers of the crowd grew louder as they got closer to the arena.

967
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,400
"Give them an adventure to remember!" Proximo shouted above
the noise.

968
01:20:49,400 --> 01:23:37,440
"Fall to one knee-they'll think you're finished. Then force yourself to your feet-our hero!" He was rushing along to
keep up with Maximus.

969
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,120
"Remember, you're an entertainer!"

970
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,160
Without a word to Proximo, Maximus walked out into the
arena.

971
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,640
There was a cheer immediately.

972
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:51,480
He was a known fighter now, and the Moroccans knew they were
going to see some real action.

973
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:56,080
Out in the bright sunlight, six fighters waited.

974
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:01,360
Maximus looked at them and decided immediately on his method
of attack.

975
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,640
He chose the strongest and most confident man first.

976
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,600
When that man went down, the others would know they had no
chance.

977
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:17,720
He cut them down, one by one, his sword striking through
their bodies with great speed.

978
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,960
It was all finished in a few minutes.

979
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,680
The crowd stood and cheered.

980
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:27,240
They shouted, "Spaniard! Spaniard!"

981
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,160
Proximo got up from his seat and walked out.

982
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:35,720
Maximus dropped his arm to his side, stepped over a body,
and walked back toward the exit.

983
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:40,960
He picked up a sword from the sand and threw it into the
crowd.

984
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:48,400
As it fell to the floor, the screaming crowd grew silent,
watching and waiting.

985
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,320
"Are you not entertained?" Maximus shouted at them.

986
01:24:52,320 --> 01:25:02,920
"Is this not why you came?" He threw down his own sword and
walked out of the arena gates and back to the prison area.

987
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,840
In the cool of the evening, Maximus and Juba stood inside
the gates of Proximo's school.

988
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,640
They looked out over the desert to the mountains in the
distance.

989
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,840
"My country-it's somewhere out there," Juba said.

990
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:34,120
"My home. My wife is preparing food and my daughters are carrying water from the river. Will I ever see them again? I
think not."

991
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,080
"Do you believe you'll meet them again-after you die?"
Maximus asked.

992
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,520
"I think so," Juba said.

993
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,240
"But I will die soon. They will not die for many years."

994
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,000
"But you would wait for them."

995
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,520
"Of course," Juba said.

996
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,160
"I almost died, coming here," said Maximus.

997
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:57,640
"You saved me. I never thanked you" Maximus looked at Juba,
and there was pain in his eyes.

998
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:02,000
"Because my wife, and my son, are waiting for me."

999
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,240
Juba understood.

1000
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,720
"You'll meet them again," he said.

1001
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,160
"But not yet, yes?" He laughed.

1002
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,160
This team was not ready for death.

1003
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,840
Later that evening, two guards came to find Maximus.

1004
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,400
They took him to Proximo.

1005
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,240
"Ah, Spaniard," he said, sending the guards away.

1006
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:25,680
"It worries me that although you're good, you could be
better. You could be the greatest."

1007
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,000
"You want me to kill. I kill," Maximus said.

1008
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
"That's enough." He turned to walk out.

1009
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,200
"Enough for a small Moroccan town like this," Proximo called
after him.

1010
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:45,520
"But not for Rome."

1011
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,600
Maximus stopped.

1012
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,960
"Rome?" he said, suddenly interested.

1013
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,800
"My men have just brought the news," Proximo said.

1014
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:13,240
"The young Emperor has arranged some games in honor of his dead father, Marcus Aurelius. It's strange to think that I
had to leave my school in Rome years ago because his father stopped all gladiator contests. But his day has ended now."

1015
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:17,240
"Yes," said Maximus, quietly, angrily.

1016
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,640
Proximo laughed.

1017
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:31,320
"We're going back! After five years in this terrible place
we're going back to the Colosseum," he said.

1018
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:46,760
"Ah, Spaniard, wait until you fight in the Colosseum. Fifty thousand Romans following every move of your sword. The
silence before you strike. The cry that comes after-like a storm!" He stopped and looked to the heavens, his eyes shining.

1019
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:54,520
Maximus saw the memories lighting up Proximo's face and
suddenly he understood.

1020
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,960
"You were once a gladiator," he said.

1021
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,840
Proximo looked back at him.

1022
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,720
"The best," he said.

1023
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,240
"You won your freedom?" Maximus asked.

1024
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:15,000
"A long time ago." Proximo went into the next room and came
back carrying a small wooden sword.

1025
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:24,600
"The Emperor gave me this. A sign of freedom. He touched me
on the shoulder and I was free."

1026
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:31,720
On the handle of the sword was Proximo's name and the words,
"Free man-By Order of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius."

1027
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,960
"I, too, want to stand in front of the Emperor, as you did."

1028
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,320
"Then listen to me," said Proximo.

1029
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:48,440
"Learn from me. I was not the best because I killed quickly. I was the best because the crowd loved me. Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom."

1030
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,480
Maximus knew that he was right.

1031
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,560
"I'll win the crowd. I'll give them something they've never
seen before."

1032
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,280
In the royal palace Commodus stood looking down at Lucius,
asleep in his bed.

1033
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,240
Lucilla entered quietly behind him.

1034
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,760
She stood in the doorway, watching, worried.

1035
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,720
"He sleeps so well because he is loved," said Commodus,
gently brushing a hair from Lucius's face.

1036
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,040
Lucilla moved forward quickly.

1037
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,440
Lucius turned over and she thought he was waking.

1038
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,840
"Shh... go back to sleep now," she said.

1039
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:29,080
She pulled his blanket closer and watched him breathe
deeply, already dreaming again.

1040
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:37,360
"Come, brother, it's late," she said, turning away and
knowing he would follow her.

1041
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,520
Back in his own room Commodus sat on the bed and picked up a
document.

1042
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,840
He looked at it, then let it fall to the floor.

1043
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:53,800
The table next to his bed was covered in other papers-plans
for the New Rome and documents from the Senate.

1044
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,320
"I can't sleep," he complained.

1045
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,640
"The Senate is always sending me papers. And my own dreams
for Rome are making my head ache."

1046
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,480
Lucilla prepared a drink for him, secretly mixing in some
medicine.

1047
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:15,960
"Quiet, brother, this will help." She held out the drink to
him and watched as he drank it.

1048
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:23,600
"Are the people ready for me to close the Senate yet? What do you think? Should I have the senators killed? Some or all
of them?" he asked Lucilla.

1049
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,440
"We'll talk about it tomorrow. Sleep now," she said.

1050
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:38,680
She thought to herself, "Rome is in frightening hands. Thank
the gods that I am here to control him."

1051
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:45,240
"Will you stay with me?" Commodus asked Lucilla.

1052
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,600
"Still afraid of the dark, brother?" Lucilla smiled gently,
kissed him, and then started to go.

1053
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,320
She stopped at the door and looked back.

1054
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,200
Commodus lay on the bed, a lonely figure, his eyes wide
open.

1055
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:01,200
"Sleep, brother," Lucilla said.

1056
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,880
"You know my dreams would bring terror to the world," he
said.

1057
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,360
Lucilla left.

1058
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,720
When she was certain that Commodus was asleep, Lucilla
quietly left the palace.

1059
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,400
She went to Senator Gracchus's house, and there in the
darkness Gaius was waiting for her.

1060
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,880
He took her arm and led her into the house, where Gracchus
met them in the hall.

1061
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,840
He turned to Lucilla.

1062
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:27,760
"Do you know, there was a time, not very long ago, when I
held two children on my knee," he said with a kind smile.

1063
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:33,560
"They were the most beautiful children I'd ever seen. And their father was very proud of them. I, too, loved them very
much, like my own."

1064
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
"And they loved you," said Lucilla.

1065
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,040
"I saw one of them grow strong and good," Gracchus
continued.

1066
01:31:40,040 --> 01:32:03,760
"The other grew... dark. I watched as his father turned away
from him. We all turned away from him. And as he became more and more lonely, there was more hate than love in his heart." Gracchus shook his head sadly.

1067
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,200
They went into the main room and Gracchus gave his guests
glasses of wine.

1068
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,800
Lucilla spoke first.

1069
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:18,640
"Anyone who says anything against the Emperor is in danger
now," she said.

1070
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:25,920
"Students, teachers, writers... we must be careful."

1071
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:37,560
"All to feed the arena. I'm afraid to go out after dark,"
said Gaius.

1072
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:40,360
"You should be more afraid in the day," said Gracchus.

1073
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:49,840
"The Senate is full of Falco's spies." He took a glass of
wine and sat next to Lucilla.

1074
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:59,880
"What is in Commodus's mind? These games are all he seems to
care about."

1075
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,320
"And how is he paying for them?" asked Gaius.

1076
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:11,160
"They must cost a fortune each day, but we have no new
taxes."

1077
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,080
"The future is paying," Lucilla answered.

1078
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:23,840
"He's started selling the wheat we have saved. In two years time the people will die of hunger. I hope they're enjoying
the games now because soon these games will be the reason their children are dead."

1079
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,400
"This can't be true," said Gaius.

1080
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,120
"Rome must know this."

1081
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,680
"And who will tell them?" asked Lucilla.

1082
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:41,520
"You, Gaius? Or you, Gracchus? Will you make a speech in the Senate and then see your family killed in the Colosseum?"
She looked from one man to the other.

1083
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,640
"He must die," she said.

1084
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:53,400
"Quintus and the guards would take control themselves," said
Gaius.

1085
01:33:53,400 --> 01:34:00,600
"And we haven't got enough men. The army may not be loyal to
us," said Gracchus.

1086
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:22,840
"No, we must wait, prepare, and be ready. We can do nothing while he has the support of the people. But every day he
makes more enemies. One day he will have more enemies than friends, and then we will strike. Until then, we must be patient."

1087
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:26,720
Proximo and his gladiators were near Rome by late afternoon.

1088
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:32,600
Proximo could see that something had changed since he left
five years before.

1089
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:35,800
Rome had become an army camp.

1090
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,440
When they were inside the city walls, he noticed other
things.

1091
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,400
The city was poorer and dirtier than he remembered it.

1092
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:50,160
At last they arrived at Proximo's old school, where the
gates were still locked as he had left them.

1093
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:54,400
The gladiators were glad to get out of the box they had
traveled in.

1094
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,880
They looked around.

1095
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:04,800
Across the rooftops of Rome, only a short distance away, was
an enormous building: the great Colosseum.

1096
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:15,640
Maximus, Juba, and the others stared at it, listening to the
sound of 50,000 voices shouting for blood.

1097
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:23,680
Each man was thinking, "Is that where I die?"

1098
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:31,320
From the great arena came another sound: "Caesar! Caesar!

1099
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:44,760
Proximo knew this meant that the Emperor had just arrived. He looked across at Maximus. "Win the crowd" he said softly.
Maximus had only one thought: "He is there.

1100
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,160
He is close.

1101
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,600
The time is coming when I will see him myself: the man I
live to kill."

1102
01:35:53,640 --> 01:36:01,840
It was late morning of the following day when Maximus and
the other gladiators were taken to the Colosseum.

1103
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,760
They were put into cages under the seats of the arena.

1104
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:13,680
Crowds of people came past to look at the new fighters, to
guess which ones were winners and which would die.

1105
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:21,960
Maximus sat at the back of the cage, taking no notice of
them.

1106
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:32,480
He could hear Proximo talking loudly to a man called
Cassius, whose job was to organize the contests in the
Colosseum.

1107
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,520
He also had to please the Emperor.

1108
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,680
"The Emperor wants battles?" Proximo shouted.

1109
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:45,440
"My men are highly trained single fighters. I refuse to let them die like that. They will be wasted in this stupid piece
of theater."

1110
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:56,360
"The crowd wants battles, so the Emperor gives them battles," Cassius replied, "and your gladiators are going to
act the Battle of Carthage. You have no choice."

1111
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,000
Their voices grew quieter as they walked away.

1112
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,360
Among the passing crowds were some young boys from rich
families, watched by their servants.

1113
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:11,880
Maximus took no notice of them until a voice suddenly made
him turn his head.

1114
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:19,480
"Gladiator!" It was one of the boys, fair-haired and about
the same age as Maximus's son.

1115
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:25,760
"Gladiator, are you the one they call 'the Spaniard?'" he
asked.

1116
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,040
Maximus moved closer to the boy.

1117
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,640
"Yes," he said.

1118
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:43,600
"They said you were enormous. They said you could squeeze a man's head until it broke, with just one hand," said the
boy.

1119
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,120
Maximus looked down at his hand.

1120
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,000
"A man's? No..." he said He held out his hand and smiled.

1121
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,200
"But maybe a boy's..."

1122
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:57,360
The boy smiled back.

1123
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,080
"I like you, Spaniard," he said.

1124
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,600
"I shall cheer for you."

1125
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:05,720
Maximus was shocked.

1126
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:08,200
"They let you watch the games?" he asked.

1127
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:13,320
"My uncle says they will make me strong," the boy replied.

1128
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,960
"But what does your father say?"

1129
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,040
"My father's dead."

1130
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,000
The boy's servant came to him and took his hand.

1131
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,480
"Come, Lucius. It's time to go."

1132
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,920
"Your name's Lucius?" asked Maximus.

1133
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,760
"Lucius Verus, like my father," Lucius said proudly.

1134
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,160
He turned and left, followed by the servant.

1135
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:37,160
With a shock, Maximus suddenly realized that the boy must be
Lucilla's son.

1136
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,920
He searched the crowd-was Lucilla somewhere out there?

1137
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:46,800
But although he kept looking, he could not see her.

1138
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,440
He could only see the faces of people who were thirsty for
blood.

1139
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

1140
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,160
The Colosseum

1141
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:59,720
The gladiators waited for their contest in an area that was
at the same level as the sand of the arena.

1142
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,400
In there they were given helmets, body armor, and swords.

1143
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:16,720
Proximo's guards led his gladiators into the area and Maximus walked over to a window He looked out at the sand
that seemed to continue forever.

1144
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:21,520
Maximus spoke in a low voice to one of the guards.

1145
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,720
"Is the Emperor here?" he asked.

1146
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:29,120
"He'll be here," the guard replied.

1147
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,560
"He comes every day."

1148
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:34,160
One of the guards held out a helmet to Maximus.

1149
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:42,280
He shook his head and looked instead at the other helmets.

1150
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,560
He chose one with a better face guard and tried it on.

1151
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:53,360
He turned his head back toward the arena, knowing that now
his face could not be recognized.

1152
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:59,760
Proximo's gladiators were armored and ready.

1153
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,240
They were dressed to look like soldiers from Carthage.

1154
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:09,080
They carried spears and long, curved, heavy shields.

1155
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:14,760
As they waited to go out into the arena, an official spoke
to them.

1156
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:20,960
"You have the honor of fighting in front of the Emperor
himself," he said.

1157
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:29,600
"When the Emperor enters, raise your spears in salute. When
you salute him, speak together," he said.

1158
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:35,720
"Face the Emperor. Don't turn your backs."

1159
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,360
"Go," Proximo said.

1160
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:51,760
"Die with honor." His five best gladiators walked past him
and onto the sand of the arena.

1161
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,800
Maximus was the last to step onto the floor of the great
Colosseum.

1162
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,960
He had never imagined such a sight.

1163
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:04,080
There were thousands and thousands of screaming, shouting
people.

1164
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,280
All around him was an ocean of cheering faces.

1165
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,160
It took his breath away.

1166
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,000
The gladiators moved into the center of the sand.

1167
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:21,360
At the same time, three other teams appeared in the arena
from different entrances.

1168
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:27,080
There was now a total of twenty gladiators on the Colosseum
stage.

1169
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:33,560
All wore the same armor and carried long double-pointed
spears and heavy metal shields.

1170
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:38,200
They stood in a line and faced the Emperor's seat.

1171
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,040
It was still empty.

1172
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:45,600
Fifty royal guards surrounded the area where Commodus and
his friends would sit.

1173
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:53,920
Then Commodus and Lucilla entered-and the crowd went wild,
cheering and shouting salutes.

1174
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,600
Lucilla and Lucius went to their seats.

1175
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,120
Commodus moved forward and waved to the crowd.

1176
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,440
Gaius and other senators near the Emperor watched in
silence.

1177
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:13,760
They had just heard the latest news: To help pay for the games, Commodus was taking the houses and money of senators
he disliked.

1178
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:21,760
Commodus looked down at the gladiators, and Maximus froze as
he felt his eyes rest on him.

1179
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,400
He stared up at the man he hated and wanted to kill.

1180
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,920
On one side of Commodus he saw Quintus.

1181
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,760
On the other side, Lucilla and Lucius.

1182
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,120
The distance between them was too great-this was not his
chance.

1183
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,080
He knew there would be a better one.

1184
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:52,600
When Cassius gave a sign, the gladiators all saluted with their spears and shouted, "Caesar-we salute you before we
die!" Only Maximus was silent.

1185
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:58,160
Cassius stepped forward to introduce the afternoon's event.

1186
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:06,440
"On this day we reach back into history to bring you the
Battle of Carthage!" The crowd cheered loudly.

1187
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:17,160
They laughed at the gladiators, dressed as the soldiers of
Carthage, the battle's losers.

1188
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:24,760
Then Cassius continued, "On that great day the gods sent
them against Rome's greatest soldiers-the Army of Africa!"

1189
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:31,840
The crowd cheered again as the doors at the ends of the arena suddenly opened with a crash, and six chariots came in
from each end.

1190
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,600
The chariots raced through the line of gladiators, who
jumped out of the way.

1191
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:42,920
They turned and came back, running over one gladiator.

1192
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:49,800
Then the chariots raced around the outside of the arena,
forcing the gladiators back into the center.

1193
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:59,760
It was difficult for the men on foot to see well through the
cloud of dust and sand from the wheels of the chariots.

1194
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:09,440
As they thundered past, Maximus saw a spear flying through
the air.

1195
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,680
It hit one of the gladiators in the neck and killed him
immediately.

1196
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:29,280
Maximus could see that he must take control and he called to the other gladiators, "If we work together, we can win!" He
made them move in closer.

1197
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:33,960
"Shields together! Shoulders against the shields!" he
called.

1198
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:37,880
The gladiators followed his orders-except for one.

1199
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:43,240
Haken stood alone, ready to fight his own battle.

1200
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,800
The crowd was very surprised.

1201
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:52,880
They had never seen anything like this before!

1202
01:44:52,880 --> 01:45:01,000
The men in the chariots circled around the group firing
arrows and spears, but they only hit the gladiators'
shields.

1203
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,840
A Roman spear from one chariot hit Haken in the leg.

1204
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:11,120
Juba threw his spear and killed the driver, and Maximus
pulled Haken into the safety of the group.

1205
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,680
Two chariots drove straight at the gladiators.

1206
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:19,680
Fixed to their wheels were short, sharp spears.

1207
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:22,720
As the wheels turned, they could cut a man to pieces.

1208
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:28,680
But the shields were good protection, and the wheel spears
broke when they hit them.

1209
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:36,240
The wheel of one chariot hit the corner of a shield, and the
chariot turned over.

1210
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,920
Another driver, close behind, crashed into it and was thrown
out.

1211
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:49,240
His chariot raced on, and its wheel spears killed him as he
tried to get away.

1212
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:58,520
A third chariot was very close, and both vehicles crashed
into the gate.

1213
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:03,680
Maximus ran for one of the broken chariots and cut the horse
free.

1214
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:08,800
He jumped onto the horse and rode fast toward one chariot.

1215
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,240
The driver was watching Maximus carefully.

1216
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:16,840
He did not see that he was very close to another vehicle.

1217
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,680
Their wheels touched.

1218
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,440
Both drivers were thrown onto the sand.

1219
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,760
One was killed by Maximus's spear, and the other died under
the feet of his horse.

1220
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:31,800
The gladiators pulled two crashed chariots into the path of
the others, who were forced to slow down.

1221
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:35,560
Then they rushed at the drivers, striking them with their
spears.

1222
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,720
Maximus looked around.

1223
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,000
All their enemies were dead.

1224
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,400
He climbed down from his horse, and the gladiators stood on
either side of him.

1225
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,280
Haken was among them.

1226
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:52,080
In the arena, Maximus, for the first time, raised his right
arm and sword high.

1227
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,960
It was the gladiators' traditional sign of beating death.

1228
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,640
The crowd cheered wildly.

1229
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,720
Commodus called for Cassius.

1230
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:04,440
"My history is not so good," he said, "but I thought we won
the Battle of Carthage."

1231
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:11,920
"Yes, sir," said Cassius, his voice shaking with fear.

1232
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,000
"Forgive me."

1233
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,600
"Oh, I'm not unhappy," said Commodus.

1234
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,680
"I enjoy surprises." He pointed to Maximus.

1235
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,920
"Who is he?"

1236
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,960
"They call him the Spaniard, sir."

1237
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,120
"I think I'll meet him," said Commodus.

1238
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:35,040
The gladiators were almost at the gate.

1239
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:41,240
Maximus turned and saw the Emperor walking out onto the
sand, smiling at him.

1240
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:48,840
He noticed a broken arrow in the sand and, as he fell to his
knees he quickly closed his hand around it.

1241
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,080
This would be his chance.

1242
01:47:50,120 --> 01:48:00,320
Commodus was nearly there... just a little further... almost
close enough to kill.

1243
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,960
Maximus was ready...

1244
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:09,280
Suddenly, Lucius ran out and took Commodus by the hand.

1245
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:19,320
Commodus laughed and moved the boy in front of him, facing
the gladiator hero.

1246
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,600
Maximus could not strike-Lucius was in the way.

1247
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:26,280
"Stand, stand," said Commodus to Maximus.

1248
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:35,040
"Now, why doesn't the hero tell us his real name?" Maximus
stood and said nothing.

1249
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:38,880
"You do have a name?" asked Commodus.

1250
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,120
"My name is Gladiator," Maximus said.

1251
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:44,040
Then he turned and walked away.

1252
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,040
It was a great insult to turn his back on the Emperor.

1253
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,160
The crowd were shocked.

1254
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:51,040
Commodus was very angry.

1255
01:48:51,080 --> 01:49:00,040
He made a sign to Quintus, who moved the royal guards into
the arena.

1256
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:06,400
They stood at the gate, swords ready, and did not let
Maximus pass.

1257
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,000
Commodus spoke calmly and clearly.

1258
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:15,920
"Slave," he said, "you will remove your helmet and tell me
your name."

1259
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,440
Slowly, Maximus turned to face him.

1260
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,280
He knew he had no choice now.

1261
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,880
He took off his helmet.

1262
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,880
Commodus stared.

1263
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,800
Quintus could not believe his eyes.

1264
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:34,960
Lucilla recognized Maximus from her seat in the arena and
put her hand over her mouth in total shock.

1265
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,560
Maximus spoke in a clear, proud voice.

1266
01:49:41,760 --> 01:50:00,200
"My name is Maximus Decimus Meridas, Commander of the Army of the North, General of the Western Armies, loyal servant
to the true Emperor, Marcus Aurelius" The Colosseum was completely silent.

1267
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,480
Then he turned to Commodus and spoke more quietly.

1268
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:13,760
"I am father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife,
and I will punish their killer, in this life or the next."

1269
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,360
Commodus gave a sign to his guards and they moved closer.

1270
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,720
The crowd shouted out.

1271
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:29,200
They had seen enough deaths for one afternoon and they did
not want their hero to be the next one.

1272
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:35,360
They reached out a forest of thumbs, pointing up to the
heavens.

1273
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,400
Their meaning was clear-Let him live!

1274
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:47,640
Commodus looked around at his people and with great
difficulty he forced himself to smile.

1275
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,800
He slowly lifted his own thumb.

1276
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,520
The crowd cheered.

1277
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:54,080
"Maximus! Maximus!" they shouted.

1278
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:58,360
Lucilla and the senators could not believe the scene
happening in front of them.

1279
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:05,040
Another shocked face was watching from his seat in the
Colosseum.

1280
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,400
It was Cicero, Maximus's servant in the army.

1281
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:14,640
As he watched the General, his mind saw many possibilities.

1282
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,600
Maximus led his men from the arena.

1283
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:24,640
He looked back just once, from the gate, and thought, "The
battle hasn't ended yet."

1284
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:29,520
In the darkness of the palace Lucilla stopped in front of
the doors to Commodus's room.

1285
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,800
She took a deep breath before she entered.

1286
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:38,600
Commodus sat calmly at his desk, signing papers.

1287
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:42,480
Lucilla was surprised that he was not still in a violent
temper.

1288
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:48,440
When he returned from the Colosseum, he had screamed in
anger and attacked a picture of Marcus Aurelius.

1289
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:55,040
Now he was quieter and behaving quite normally.

1290
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,040
She walked up to the desk.

1291
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,640
"Why is he still alive?" he asked her.

1292
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,360
"I don't know," she said.

1293
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:06,720
"He shouldn't be alive," her brother said.

1294
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:09,280
"That makes me angry. I am terribly angry."

1295
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:12,080
Lucilla watched him carefully, waiting for an explosion.

1296
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,440
"I only did the things I had to do," said Commodus.

1297
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:24,000
"Father's plan was crazy-the Empire... Rome... they must
continue. You do understand that, don't you?"

1298
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,120
"Yes," replied Lucilla.

1299
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:30,720
He moved to the tall window and looked out at Rome, quiet
now in the late night.

1300
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:39,920
"They lied to me in Germany. They told me he was dead. If they lie to me, they don't honor me. If they don't honor me,
how can they ever love me?"

1301
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:45,640
Maximus was lying awake in the dark of the prison when he
heard a guard coming.

1302
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:47,760
He was on his feet immediately.

1303
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:54,840
The guard entered and took Maximus along to another prison
room.

1304
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,560
He chained him to the wall and left without a word.

1305
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,640
And into the light stepped a woman.

1306
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:01,320
Lucilla.

1307
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,680
Maximus stared at her.

1308
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:05,160
"I knew your brother would send one of his killers," he
said.

1309
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,120
"I didn't think he would send his best."

1310
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:13,680
"Maximus, he doesn't know..." Lucilla began.

1311
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,480
"My family were burnt alive!" Maximus interrupted, throwing
the words at her in anger.

1312
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,880
"I knew nothing of that, you must believe me. I cried for
them."

1313
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,920
"As you cried for your father?" said Maximus.

1314
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:36,920
"I have been living in a prison of fear since that day,"
Lucilla said.

1315
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:43,520
"I live in terror for my son because he will be the next
emperor..."

1316
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,960
"My son was innocent," said Maximus.

1317
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,920
"So is mine," she replied.

1318
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,560
"Must my son die, too, before you'll trust me?"

1319
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:54,920
Maximus began then to relax.

1320
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:00,000
"Why does it matter if I trust you or not?" he asked.

1321
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:08,360
"The gods have allowed you to live. Today I saw a slave
become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome," she said.

1322
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:21,040
"Use that power, Maximus. My brother has many enemies, but until today no one was strong enough to face him. The people
were with you, they would follow you."

1323
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:25,480
"I am only one man. What possible difference can I make?"

1324
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:36,000
"Some politicians have worked all their lives for the good of Rome-one man above all. If I can arrange it, will you
meet him?" she asked.

1325
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:45,560
"Don't you understand? I could be killed tonight in this
prison-or tomorrow in the arena. I'm just a slave now."

1326
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:50,560
"This man wants the same things as you," said Lucilla.

1327
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:57,400
"Then let him kill Commodus!" Maximus said in anger.

1328
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:01,840
Lucilla searched for a way to make him understand.

1329
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:04,680
"I knew a man once," she said.

1330
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:15,880
"He loved my father very much and my father loved him. This
man served Rome well."

1331
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:21,040
"That man is gone," said Maximus.

1332
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:25,480
"Your brother did his work well."

1333
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:26,880
"Let me help you," said Lucilla.

1334
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:32,320
"Yes, you can help me. Forget you ever knew me," Maximus
replied.

1335
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:39,680
"And never come here again." He shouted for the guard.

1336
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,560
"This lady has finished with me," he said.

1337
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:48,240
The guard unlocked the door and led Maximus away.

1338
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,200
CHAPTER NINE

1339
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,640
A Man for the People

1340
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:57,120
Senator Gracchus climbed the many stairs inside the
Colosseum.

1341
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:03,560
He listened to the shouting crowd and he was not
enthusiastic about being there.

1342
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,800
He joined a group of other senators near the top of the
arena.

1343
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,400
"Senator Gracchus," Falco said with surprise.

1344
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,440
"We don't often see you enjoying the pleasures of the
crowd."

1345
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,640
"I don't pretend to be a man of the people," said Gracchus.

1346
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:23,320
"But I do try to be a man for the people."

1347
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,160
The Colosseum was full.

1348
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:33,280
The crowd was already beginning to shout the name of their
hero and favorite gladiator.

1349
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:36,120
"Maximus... Maximus... Maximus."

1350
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:39,840
Cassius started to introduce the next event of the day.

1351
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:51,240
"Now, as we celebrate the sixty-fourth day of the games, you will see how kind the Emperor is and how he loves his
people!"

1352
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:55,080
Servants came into the arena pulling great boxes.

1353
01:56:55,080 --> 01:57:00,120
They removed the covers and took out loaves of bread.

1354
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:02,600
Then they started to throw them into the crowd.

1355
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:07,960
Other servants appeared at the top of the steps and threw
the bread down.

1356
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:13,040
There were thousands of loaves.

1357
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:19,640
The crowd cheered and caught as many loaves as they could.

1358
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:24,160
Commodus chose this as the best time for him to enter.

1359
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:29,520
Below, in the prison area, Proximo stood with Maximus.

1360
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:32,080
They heard a great cheer go up from the crowd.

1361
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:37,920
"He certainly knows how to please them," said Proximo.

1362
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:45,600
"Marcus Aurelius had a dream for Rome, Proximo," said
Maximus.

1363
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,840
"This is not it."

1364
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:52,400
"Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus," Proximo reminded him.

1365
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:58,960
In the arena the servants had thrown all the bread to the
crowd, and Cassius spoke again.

1366
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:22,080
"The Emperor has decided there will be a special contest today. Five years after his last fight in the Colosseum, we
bring you the greatest gladiator in Roman history! Today Tigris of France returns!"

1367
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:28,760
The crowd loved a surprise and they cheered in excitement as
Tigris drove his chariot into the arena.

1368
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,080
He was a large man of about forty-five and he looked
dangerous.

1369
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:37,560
He wore silver armor and a silver tiger helmet with a face
guard.

1370
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:43,920
The bright sun shone off his helmet as he rode around the
arena with his arm held high.

1371
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,600
The crowd shouted and cheered even more loudly.

1372
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:51,440
Tigris stopped his chariot, got down, and waited in the
center of the arena.

1373
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:55,480
He was carrying a sword and a spear and he looked
frightening.

1374
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:59,840
When the crowd became quieter, Cassius started to speak
again.

1375
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:08,240
"And from the great school of Aelius Proximo... Caesar is
pleased to give you... the Spaniard, Maximus!"

1376
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:11,280
There were more cheers and shouts from the crowd.

1377
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:14,160
Maximus appeared from his gate.

1378
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:20,320
He was carrying only a short sword and a round silver
shield.

1379
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,800
He had no armor or helmet.

1380
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:29,080
Among the crowd that day were a group of people who did not
usually go to watch gladiator games.

1381
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:35,600
They were soldiers from the Army of the North, with Valerius
and Cicero at their center.

1382
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:39,960
They had come to see if it was true that their general was
really still alive.

1383
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:43,080
When he got close enough for them to recognize him, they
were very happy.

1384
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:50,560
They shouted to Maximus, but he could not hear their voices
among so many others.

1385
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,280
Commodus was also watching Maximus closely.

1386
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,280
"They love him like one of their own," he said to Lucilla.

1387
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:05,320
"The crowd has its favorite for a time-then they find
someone new. He'll be forgotten in a month," she replied.

1388
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,400
"No," said Commodus, smiling.

1389
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:12,400
"Much sooner than that. It's been arranged."

1390
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,320
Down on the arena sand, Maximus looked at Tigris.

1391
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:21,880
"Only one man with a sword and spear?" he thought.

1392
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:27,040
"Something's wrong. What don't I know?"

1393
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:33,120
Maximus stopped a short distance from Tigris.

1394
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:43,840
They saluted each other, and then Tigris turned to the
Emperor and raised his sword.

1395
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,440
"Before we die, we salute you," he said.

1396
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:51,240
Maximus did not turn to the Emperor, or salute him.

1397
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:58,720
Instead, he bent down and picked up some sand, then let it
run through his fingers.

1398
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,480
Tigris pulled down the face guard on his helmet.

1399
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,920
Then he immediately attacked Maximus.

1400
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:07,800
Maximus struck back at him.

1401
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:13,120
The two men were equal contestants-both strong and fast.

1402
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:16,200
Maximus was the younger man and he was very confident.

1403
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:20,240
He believed that he would not be killed that day.

1404
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:25,360
As they fought, Maximus suddenly heard a strange noise.

1405
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:30,360
He could not understand where it was coming from.

1406
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,000
Then he felt the ground move.

1407
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:42,360
Suddenly, a door opened in the sand behind him and an
enormous tiger came out.

1408
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:44,000
It jumped at him.

1409
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:56,880
He felt the tiger's breath on his back as he moved quickly to one side, and he expected the animal to land on top of
him.

1410
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,400
But when he looked, he saw that it was on the end of a long
chain.

1411
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:03,480
This was held tightly by three men near the wall.

1412
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:09,520
Tigris attacked again with great strength, forcing Maximus
back toward the tiger.

1413
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,440
Maximus also attacked, and drove Tigris in a new direction.

1414
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:17,840
Then a second door opened in the sand, and another tiger
jumped into the arena.

1415
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,960
Maximus found a new position and continued to fight, as two
more tigers suddenly appeared from the ground.

1416
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:27,640
There were now four tigers, one in each corner of the
battlefield.

1417
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:31,880
Maximus had five enemies to fight and he looked for a weak
point.

1418
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:36,360
Then it seemed that all four tigers were suddenly closer!

1419
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:39,200
Maximus realized what was happening.

1420
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:43,280
When Tigris was near a tiger, the men holding the chain
pulled it in a little.

1421
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:46,480
When Maximus was near, they let the chain out further.

1422
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:51,400
Finally, Maximus's strength and speed began to beat Tigris.

1423
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:54,760
He knocked Tigris back and they fell onto the sand together.

1424
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:59,000
Maximus quickly jumped to his feet and stood over him, his
sword at his throat.

1425
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:04,600
But then one of the teams of servants let go of the chain
and a tiger ran at Maximus.

1426
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:09,120
He just had time to turn and push his sword upward into the
tiger's shoulders.

1427
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,760
The animal fell on top of him and died.

1428
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:17,520
This gave Tigris enough time to get to his feet, pick up his
sword, and prepare to attack again.

1429
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:24,760
Maximus was under the heavy body of the dead tiger but he
still had enough strength to throw his shield up at Tigris.

1430
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:28,440
It hit Tigris hard on the face guard of his helmet and bent
it.

1431
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:30,880
It was impossible for him to see through it.

1432
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:35,920
Tigris was forced to drop his sword again so he could use
both hands to try to pull the cover up.

1433
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:40,800
Maximus was able to squeeze out from under the tiger and
pick up Tigris's sword.

1434
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:45,760
The Frenchman was still blindly pulling at his helmet as
Maximus knocked him to the ground.

1435
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,960
Maximus stood over Tigris with his sword point at his
throat.

1436
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,160
He looked to Commodus.

1437
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:55,360
All eyes in the Colosseum turned to the Emperor.

1438
02:03:55,360 --> 02:04:00,080
Commodus was very angry but tried not to show it.

1439
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:03,760
He slowly stood and looked down at Maximus.

1440
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,880
He raised his arm and held out his hand-thumb down.

1441
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:18,880
Maximus raised his sword to kill Tigris... but suddenly
threw it down on the sand, next to his head.

1442
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:20,840
"You fought with honor," he said.

1443
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:28,520
The crowd was silent, then suddenly there was an enormous
cheer.

1444
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:33,680
The shouts of "Maximus... Maximus..." grew louder and
louder.

1445
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:37,800
Commodus turned and disappeared from sight.

1446
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:44,440
Senator Gracchus suddenly sat forward and started to take a
real interest in the behavior of the crowd.

1447
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:51,400
Maximus was almost at the gladiators' exit from the arena
when a group of royal guards appeared in front of him.

1448
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:55,800
They stepped back as Commodus walked through them and toward
the great fighter.

1449
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:01,000
Maximus and Commodus stared at each other, just an arm's
length away.

1450
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,120
The crowd was quiet now but they could not hear what was
said.

1451
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:13,360
"What am I going to do with you?" said Commodus.

1452
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,240
Maximus did not reply.

1453
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:21,680
"Once more I offer you my hand," Commodus said.

1454
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:25,640
He held out his arm, but Maximus did not move.

1455
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:31,720
"Are we so different, you and I?" said Commodus.

1456
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:36,200
"You take life when you have to, just as I do."

1457
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:41,080
"I have one more life to take," said Maximus.

1458
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:42,960
"Then it is finished."

1459
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:47,840
"Then take it now," said Commodus.

1460
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:54,760
Maximus knew he only had to take one step toward Commodus
and the guards would kill him.

1461
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:58,560
He turned his back on the Emperor and walked away.

1462
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,000
The crowd went mad!

1463
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,040
They cheered Maximus, their hero.

1464
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:09,000
And then some started laughing at the Emperor and throwing
bread at him.

1465
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Gracchus could not believe his eyes.

1466
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:16,440
Such insults to the Emperor usually resulted in death.

1467
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:19,480
But the people were not afraid now.

1468
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,040
All this, because of one brave man.

1469
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:32,240
Maximus and the gladiators were chained together again for
the walk back to Proximo's school.

1470
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:36,440
There were guards walking with them, trying to keep back
hundreds of people.

1471
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:39,480
They all wanted to get a close look at their hero.

1472
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:45,080
Suddenly, Maximus heard a familiar voice and saw Cicero
ahead in the crowd.

1473
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:49,320
"Where are you camped?" he shouted to Cicero.

1474
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:52,760
"A day's ride from Rome-at Ostia," replied Cicero.

1475
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,480
"We've been there all winter. The men are getting fat.
They're bored."

1476
02:06:57,480 --> 02:07:01,280
"How soon could they be ready to fight?" asked Maximus,

1477
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:05,400
"For you, sir? Tomorrow," Cicero said proudly.

1478
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:09,280
The guards pushed Cicero back into the crowd.

1479
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:13,880
He ran ahead and came out in front of Maximus again, further
along the street.

1480
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:17,480
This time he pushed a small package into Maximus's hand.

1481
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:21,440
The guards were close and Maximus knew he only had one
chance.

1482
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,880
"Cicero! Listen carefully!" he said.

1483
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:30,400
"You must contact Lucilla, the Emperor's sister. Tell her I
will meet her politician."

1484
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:32,200
There was no more time.

1485
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:37,320
Cicero disappeared into the crowd, and Maximus was forced to
move on.

1486
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:45,520
Later, alone in the prison at Proximo's school, Maximus took
the little package out of his pocket and looked at it.

1487
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,840
Inside were the two wooden figures of his wife and son.

1488
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:55,080
"Do they hear you?" a voice suddenly asked.

1489
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:59,200
Maximus looked up into Juba's eyes.

1490
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:04,840
"Your people," said Juba, "in the next world."

1491
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:10,560
"Yes" said Maximus, looking down at the figures.

1492
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,960
Juba thought about it.

1493
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,080
"What do you say to them?"

1494
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:18,240
Maximus looked at his friend.

1495
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:25,440
"To my son, to keep his head up when he rides his horse," he
said.

1496
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:28,920
"And to my wife... that's private."

1497
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,640
Juba smiled.

1498
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,880
CHAPTER TEN

1499
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,560
Secrets and Lies

1500
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:42,080
Commodus walked up and down in his room.

1501
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:43,360
He was a worried man.

1502
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:47,560
There was one other person with him: Senator Falco.

1503
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:54,120
"An emperor cannot rule if he is not loved!" Commodus said
to Falco.

1504
02:08:54,120 --> 02:09:06,200
"And now they love Maximus because he let Tigris live. I can't kill him now or they will hate me. But I can't just
let him continue like this-every day he adds another insult. It's like a bad dream."

1505
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:10,480
"Every day his power is greater," said Falco.

1506
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:21,080
"And the people are getting braver. The Senate sees it, too. This is not something that will go away in a few days or
weeks. Rome is beginning to move against you. He must die."

1507
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:25,000
"Then they will love him even more!" shouted Commodus.

1508
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,720
He began walking again and soon he was calmer.

1509
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:37,840
"When I went to the Senate today," he said, "I purposely told them about selling the wheat to pay for the games. And
what happened?"

1510
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,440
"Nothing," said Falco.

1511
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:44,320
"Exactly! Nothing!" said Commodus.

1512
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:53,400
"Even Gracchus was as silent as a mouse. Why?" He stopped
and looked out his window over Rome.

1513
02:09:53,400 --> 02:10:00,760
"We must be quiet and patient, Caesar. We must let the enemy
come to us," said Falco.

1514
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:03,280
Commodus began to relax a little.

1515
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:09,160
"Have every senator followed," he ordered.

1516
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,840
"I want daily reports."

1517
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:19,400
It was easy to find Lucilla, but much harder to speak to
her.

1518
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:23,560
For two days Cicero stayed in the streets around the palace.

1519
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:24,960
Finally, he was lucky.

1520
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:29,800
Lucilla's carriage came toward him, surrounded by royal
guards.

1521
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,840
There were two other men following her carriage- but they
were not in uniform.

1522
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:37,440
One, a small man, was blind in one eye.

1523
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,840
He was one of Falco's secret police.

1524
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:46,320
He had been very good at watching senators, but now he had
been given a different job.

1525
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:47,960
He was watching Lucilla.

1526
02:10:47,960 --> 02:11:00,600
As the carriage passed, Cicero called out, "My lady! I served your father at Vindobona!" Lucilla heard but did not
pay him much attention.

1527
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:04,720
The guards pushed him away, and he ran around to the other
side of the carriage.

1528
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:09,960
"And I served General Maximus!" he said, when he got close
enough.

1529
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:13,200
Lucilla called for her carriage to stop.

1530
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:17,160
She asked her servant for a coin and held it out to Cicero.

1531
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:23,760
"And I serve him still," he said, as he came closer to take
it.

1532
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:27,680
Lucilla understood at once that he was a messenger.

1533
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,280
She told her guards to step back.

1534
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:34,880
"This is for your loyalty, soldier," she said.

1535
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:38,360
Cicero took the coin and kissed her hand.

1536
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:43,600
He whispered, "A message from the General. He'll meet your
politician."

1537
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:45,280
It was enough.

1538
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:50,720
Cicero stepped back into the crowd, and Lucilla's carriage
moved on.

1539
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:56,160
Proximo's school was dark and quiet.

1540
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:59,120
The men were all asleep, except one.

1541
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:04,680
Proximo went quietly to wake Maximus and then took him to
his own rooms.

1542
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:08,960
Lucilla and Gracchus were there, waiting for Maximus.

1543
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:12,520
Proximo turned and left immediately.

1544
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,360
Lucilla introduced Gracchus to Maximus.

1545
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:20,200
"The Senate is with you?" asked Maximus.

1546
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:27,400
"The Senate? Yes, I can speak for them," Gracchus replied.

1547
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:34,080
"Can you buy my freedom and get me out of Rome?" asked
Maximus, wasting no time.

1548
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:35,360
"Why would I do that?"

1549
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:48,440
"Get me out of the city. Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army is camped there. By the second night, I'll
be back with 5,000 men," said Maximus.

1550
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:51,800
"But there are new commanders," said Lucilla.

1551
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:53,360
"Loyal to Commodus."

1552
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,840
"Let my men see me alive. They are still loyal to me."

1553
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,640
"This is crazy," said Gracchus.

1554
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:13,280
"No Roman army has entered the city in 100 years. This may be no better than the rule of Commodus. And what next? After
the battle to take control of Rome you'll take your men and just... leave?"

1555
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:14,920
"I will leave," said Maximus.

1556
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:21,240
"The soldiers will stay to protect you, under the command of
the Senate."

1557
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:28,800
"When all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the
people?" asked Gracchus.

1558
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,280
"Tell me why."

1559
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:37,920
"Because that was the last wish of a dying man," said
Maximus, quietly.

1560
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,480
"I will kill Commodus and leave Rome to you."

1561
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:46,960
There was silence, then Gracchus spoke again.

1562
02:13:47,000 --> 02:14:02,560
"Marcus Aurelius trusted you, his daughter trusts you. So I will trust you, too. Give me two days." He held out his hand
to Maximus.

1563
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:03,720
"And stay alive."

1564
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:12,800
In his beautiful house Senator Gracchus listened to the
cheers coming from the Colosseum.

1565
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:16,400
His servant helped him pack a large amount of money into a
bag.

1566
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:22,080
"Wait outside the Colosseum. He'll come to you," he told the
man.

1567
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:27,160
Gracchus's servant left the house and walked toward the
Colosseum.

1568
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:31,640
All the way he was followed by one of Falco's secret police.

1569
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:35,280
Proximo sat in a cafe and waited.

1570
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:40,840
He seemed to be watching the crowd passing, but really he
was looking for Gracchus's servant.

1571
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:45,960
He knew immediately when he saw him, but just continued
drinking his wine.

1572
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:47,800
He looked up and down the street.

1573
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:53,400
Suddenly, he saw a man standing by a door and he did not
like the look of him.

1574
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:56,160
It was Falco's one-eyed secret policeman.

1575
02:14:56,240 --> 02:15:02,960
Gracchus's servant stood patiently for a long time with his
bag of money, but no one came to him.

1576
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:06,960
In the cafe Proximo's table was now empty.

1577
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,120
He knew when to disappear.

1578
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:17,920
Maximus was brought to Proximo's room by two guards just
after sunset.

1579
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:20,480
He was impatient, ready to start.

1580
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:23,520
Proximo looked at Maximus and shook his head.

1581
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,680
"I tried," he said.

1582
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:32,760
"It won't work. The Emperor knows too much. And this has
become too dangerous for me."

1583
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:39,080
"Let me go," said Maximus, "and you'll be paid when I
return. I promise you."

1584
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:43,280
"And what will happen if you don't return?" asked Proximo.

1585
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:48,600
"Trust me - I will kill Commodus," said Maximus.

1586
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:52,920
Proximo looked hard at Maximus, studying him.

1587
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:56,920
"I know I can trust you, General," he said.

1588
02:15:56,920 --> 02:16:07,800
"I know you would die for honor, or for Rome, or the memory of your family. I, on the other hand, am just an
entertainer." He called for his guards.

1589
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,000
"Take him away."

1590
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:15,360
Maximus looked straight into Proximo's eyes.

1591
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:20,240
"He killed the man who freed you," he said.

1592
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:29,080
After Maximus had gone, Proximo picked up the wooden sword
that Marcus Aurelius had given him, the sign of his freedom.

1593
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,840
And he thought for a long time.

1594
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:34,240
Falco's spies were good at their job.

1595
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:42,200
They had followed Gracchus and the other senators, then
Lucilla, and now Proximo.

1596
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:48,040
Lucilla knew their lives were in great danger and she tried
to keep her brother calm.

1597
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,360
Maximus also knew it.

1598
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:53,720
Commodus would come for him soon, he was certain.

1599
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:59,240
In the dark of night in his prison room, he suddenly heard
footsteps coming toward him.

1600
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:00,440
It was Proximo.

1601
02:17:00,440 --> 02:17:02,960
He woke Juba and threw him out.

1602
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,080
Then he turned to Maximus.

1603
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,880
"Congratulations, General," he said.

1604
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:14,440
"You have very good friends." He stepped back and Lucilla
came into the room.

1605
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:16,400
Proximo left them together.

1606
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:21,920
"My brother plans to put Gracchus in prison," she said.

1607
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:29,880
"We can't wait any longer. You must leave tonight. Proximo will come for you at midnight and take you to a gate. Cicero
will be there with horses."

1608
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:34,600
"You've done all this? You're very brave, Lucilla."

1609
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:38,720
"I am tired of being brave," she said.

1610
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:42,200
"My brother hates everyone-and you most of all."

1611
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,440
"Because your father chose me."

1612
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:47,240
"No," she said.

1613
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:51,280
"Because my father loved you... and I loved you."

1614
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:54,360
Maximus took her hands in his.

1615
02:17:54,360 --> 02:18:00,760
"I've felt alone all my life-except with you," she said.

1616
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:07,080
She turned to go, but Maximus held her and they kissed.

1617
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:14,200
It was their first kiss for many years, and, for a short
time, they rested in each other's arms.

1618
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:21,320
They separated, with one last look, and Lucilla went quickly
back into the dark night.

1619
02:18:21,320 --> 02:18:27,200
Back in the palace, Lucilla hurried to her son's bedroom.

1620
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:30,240
She looked around and called to the servant.

1621
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:31,680
"Where is Lucius?"

1622
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:35,360
"He's with the Emperor, my lady," she replied

1623
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:39,920
Lucilla rushed down the palace halls, looking in all the
rooms she passed.

1624
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,040
Finally, in great fear, she opened her brother's door.

1625
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:47,840
Commodus and Lucius were sitting together, looking at some
papers.

1626
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:53,560
"Sister, come and join us," said Commodus, smiling.

1627
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:55,000
A frightening smile.

1628
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:02,520
"I've been reading to dear Lucius about the great Julius
Caesar." He took Lucius on his knee.

1629
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:09,920
"And tomorrow, if you're very good, I'll tell you the story
of the Emperor Claudius," he said.

1630
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,440
Commodus looked right into Lucilla's eyes.

1631
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:21,000
"He trusted the people closest to him, but they didn't
deserve his trust."

1632
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,160
Lucilla felt faint.

1633
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:26,400
She sat down opposite them.

1634
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:36,280
"The Emperor knew they had been very busy, planning against him," Commodus went on, watching his sister's terror all the
time.

1635
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:48,640
"And one night he sat down with one of them and said to her, 'Tell me what you have planned, or I shall kill the person
you love the most. You will see me wash in their blood."

1636
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:56,160
Lucilla kept her eyes on her son, and a tear ran down her
face.

1637
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:09,040
"And the Emperor's heart was broken because she had wounded him more than anyone else could. And what do you think
happened next, Lucius?"

1638
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:14,760
"I don't know, Uncle," said Lucius, nervously.

1639
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:20,000
"She told him everything," Commodus said.

1640
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,760
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1641
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:27,400
Broken Plans

1642
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:34,640
The sound of marching feet broke the silence of night in the
area around the Colosseum.

1643
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:39,480
In his room Proximo was packing his bags, planning to leave
Rome fast.

1644
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:45,000
He heard the marching feet coming toward the school and he
knew then how he was going to die.

1645
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:50,080
He picked up his bunch of keys and hurried across to the
prison rooms.

1646
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,600
He was almost there when the royal guards arrived and
stopped in front of his gates.

1647
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:59,040
"Open up in the name of the Emperor!" the captain called out
loudly.

1648
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:03,000
For a few seconds Proximo paused, without turning to look at
them.

1649
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,920
Then he continued toward the prisons.

1650
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,440
Maximus had also heard the marching feet and knew their
meaning exactly.

1651
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:13,920
He watched as Proximo appeared through the prison entrance,
keys in hand.

1652
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:16,160
"Everything is ready," said Proximo.

1653
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:19,080
He handed the keys to Maximus.

1654
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:21,320
"It seems you've won your freedom."

1655
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:28,360
"Proximo," said Maximus, as he took the keys, "are you in
danger of becoming a good man?"

1656
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:30,880
Proximo walked back to his rooms.

1657
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:36,560
The guards could see him through the gates, but he did not
look across at them once.

1658
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:41,960
"The Emperor commands you to open these gates, Proximo!"
shouted the captain.

1659
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:51,480
"Do you want to die, old man? Tonight all enemies of the Emperor must die!" Proximo walked on, and up the stairs to
his room.

1660
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:55,840
"Break the locks!" shouted the captain.

1661
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,200
Maximus quickly unlocked his door.

1662
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:02,720
Then he and Juba let Haken and the others out.

1663
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:06,120
The sound of metal hitting metal came from the gates.

1664
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:08,680
Maximus knew he had to go, now.

1665
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:10,720
He handed the bunch of keys to Juba.

1666
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,520
Juba took them, understanding.

1667
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:14,360
"Go!" he said.

1668
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:19,520
The gates to Proximo's school flew open and the guards
rushed in.

1669
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,760
Maximus ran for the back entrance.

1670
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:29,160
Juba, Haken, and the other gladiators threw themselves between the guards and Maximus and slowed them down enough
for him to get away.

1671
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:33,640
By the back entrance Maximus found his army sword and armor
waiting for him.

1672
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:38,200
In the fighting, Juba was knocked to the ground and left for
dead.

1673
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:43,200
Haken was first wounded by a Roman sword and then shot
through the chest with four arrows.

1674
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:47,160
His enormous body fell, dead, at the bottom of the stairs.

1675
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:52,240
The guards climbed over Haken's body and raced up to
Proximo's room.

1676
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:56,560
When they broke through the door, they found him at his desk
with his back to them.

1677
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:01,280
In his hand was the wooden sword Marcus Aurelius had given
him with his freedom.

1678
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:03,080
He did not turn to see death coming.

1679
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:09,280
The end came quickly, with three deep wounds to his neck and
back.

1680
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:14,960
He died with the wooden sword hanging at his side, held
tightly in his hand.

1681
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:23,640
Maximus came out of the back entrance to the school and
waited quietly in the shadows.

1682
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:25,880
Suddenly, he heard a horse move.

1683
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,640
He looked toward the sound and moved out into the street.

1684
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,480
There were two horses waiting, one with a rider.

1685
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:35,920
As he got closer, he could see that it was Cicero.

1686
02:23:35,960 --> 02:23:37,320
But something felt wrong.

1687
02:23:37,320 --> 02:23:42,560
Maximus hid behind some rocks and whispered Cicero's name.

1688
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:43,680
Cicero turned.

1689
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,640
"Maximus!" he shouted.

1690
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:48,440
"No!"

1691
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:53,000
As he shouted, his horse suddenly ran and Cicero was pulled
from it by a rope around his neck.

1692
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,200
He was left hanging from the tree above.

1693
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:59,240
Maximus rushed forward and caught him by the legs.

1694
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:03,240
At the same time six arrows flew into Cicero's chest,
killing him immediately.

1695
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:05,000
Maximus had his sword ready.

1696
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,040
But there were too many guards and he had no chance.

1697
02:24:08,040 --> 02:24:14,200
A voice called out, "Take him alive!" and the guards quickly
caught him, making him a prisoner again.

1698
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:24,040
At sunrise, even before their servants were awake, Senator Gaius and his wife were murdered in their bed by royal
guards.

1699
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:30,320
Seven other senators were killed the same morning, also many
private citizens.

1700
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:34,560
All these people had upset Commodus in some way.

1701
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,160
His secret police had done a good job.

1702
02:24:37,160 --> 02:24:45,000
Senator Gracchus was not killed, but the guards took him
away from his home and threw him into prison.

1703
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,840
In his room at the palace Falco came to tell Commodus the
news.

1704
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:53,600
Commodus was pleased that so many of his enemies were
finished.

1705
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:56,960
After Falco had gone, he spoke to Lucilla.

1706
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:03,840
"Lucius will stay with me now," he said, walking across the
room toward her.

1707
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:17,000
"And if his mother even looks at me in a way that upsets me, he will die. If she decides to take her own life, he will
die." He smiled and touched her hair.

1708
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,640
"Kiss me, sister," he said.

1709
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:25,200
It was hot and dusty in the Colosseum.

1710
02:25:25,240 --> 02:25:33,080
Hundreds of servants at the top of the arena were throwing
red flowers down onto the sand.

1711
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:36,200
Fifty-five thousand Romans were waiting.

1712
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,280
They had been told to expect something special.

1713
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,040
Maximus was also waiting.

1714
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,880
He knew there was only death ahead of him.

1715
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:50,000
But he still hoped for a soldier's death, and he kept his
back straight and his head up.

1716
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,760
On his way to the arena he passed a prison room where Juba
and Proximo's other gladiators were.

1717
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:01,120
When he saw Maximus, Juba stood in a silent salute to a
brave man and a friend.

1718
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:07,960
Under the floor of the Colosseum arena was a large elevator,
operated by servants with ropes.

1719
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,280
It was the way the tigers had entered the arena when Maximus
fought Tigris.

1720
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:16,720
Maximus was led there now by Quintus and the royal guards.

1721
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:21,200
They fastened his chains to the elevator and Quintus himself
checked them.

1722
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:26,400
As he bent to do this he whispered softly, "I'm a soldier. I
obey."

1723
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:30,080
Someone was walking toward them.

1724
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:33,440
Quintus stood up again and moved back.

1725
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:39,400
Emperor Commodus suddenly appeared with a group of servants
carrying armor.

1726
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:42,800
The Emperor himself was wearing his own gold armor.

1727
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:46,560
He wore this armor when he wanted to feel like a god.

1728
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:52,200
Commodus and six of his guards joined Maximus on the
elevator.

1729
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:57,440
Maximus expected to die immediately, but Commodus smiled at
him.

1730
02:26:57,440 --> 02:27:02,640
"Listen to the crowd," he said.

1731
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:17,120
"They are calling for you. The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who insulted
an emperor." He called his servants forward with the armor.

1732
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,560
"It's a good story" he said.

1733
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:28,200
"And now the people want to know how the story ends. Only a
great death will be good enough," Commodus continued.

1734
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:33,840
"And what could be better than to fight the Emperor himself
in the greatest arena?"

1735
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,440
Maximus did not believe him.

1736
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:39,040
"You will fight me?"

1737
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,600
"Why not?" Commodus said.

1738
02:27:42,600 --> 02:27:45,240
"Do you think I'm afraid?"

1739
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:52,480
The servants began to fix armor to Maximus's body, first his
arms, legs, and shoulders.

1740
02:27:52,480 --> 02:27:54,520
They left the body armor until last.

1741
02:27:54,520 --> 02:28:00,800
"I think you've been afraid all your life," Maximus
answered.

1742
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:04,360
He knew Commodus would never have a fair fight with him.

1743
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:06,440
What would he do to make sure he won?

1744
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:12,760
"Unlike Maximus the Brave, who knows no fear?" said
Commodus.

1745
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:24,840
"I've been afraid, But you took away from me everything I loved. Since then, you're right, I have not known fear,"
said Maximus.

1746
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:32,160
"There is one thing left-you still have your life to lose,"
said Commodus.

1747
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:41,240
"I once knew a man who said, 'Death smiles at us all. A man
can only smile back,'" said Maximus.

1748
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:47,400
"I wonder," said Commodus, "did your friend smile at his own
death?"

1749
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:51,480
"You must know," Maximus replied.

1750
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:55,240
"He was your father."

1751
02:28:55,240 --> 02:29:00,800
Commodus was silent, and they stared at each other.

1752
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:05,680
"You loved my father, I know," Commodus said.

1753
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:17,040
"But I did, too. That makes us brothers, doesn't it?" He
reached out his arms to Maximus and put them around him.

1754
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:20,160
Maximus suddenly let out a cry of pain.

1755
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:23,480
The Emperor had a small, sharp knife in his hand.

1756
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,480
He had wounded Maximus in the side, cutting him deeply.

1757
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:35,400
"Smile for me now, brother," Commodus said, as he pulled the
knife out.

1758
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:37,040
Quintus stared, shocked.

1759
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:44,560
"Now put on his body armor. Hide the wound," Commodus said
to his servants.

1760
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:52,040
All eyes in the Colosseum watched the center of the arena as
the elevator came up.

1761
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:54,720
Commodus stepped off and onto the sand.

1762
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:57,000
It was covered with red flowers.

1763
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:02,760
Commodus took his sword from Quintus and turned slowly to
all sides of the arena.

1764
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:06,600
Maximus stood straight, but he was in great pain.

1765
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:12,280
He looked up to the royal seats and saw Lucilla there with
Lucius and Senator Gracchus.

1766
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:14,160
They were surrounded by guards.

1767
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:19,440
Commodus raised his sword high and the sun shone off it.

1768
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:24,760
Maximus slowly bent down and picked up some sand from the
arena.

1769
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:29,000
Quintus threw Maximus's sword down on the ground near his
feet.

1770
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,600
Maximus picked it up, slowly, and stood facing the Emperor.

1771
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:35,520
And the fight began.

1772
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:41,520
Commodus rushed at Maximus and knocked him to the ground.

1773
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,400
Maximus got to his feet with difficulty.

1774
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,720
The arena seemed to be turning around.

1775
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:50,040
The sun danced off the Emperor's armor and blinded him.

1776
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:55,280
He heard the noise of the crowd-now it seemed to be far
away, now close.

1777
02:30:55,280 --> 02:31:01,640
Standing behind the entrance, Juba saw a thin line of blood
running out from under Maximus's armor.

1778
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:03,320
Lucilla watched him in fear.

1779
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:06,680
He seemed to be looking straight at her.

1780
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:08,080
Could he see her?

1781
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:11,560
She held out her hand and called his name.

1782
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:12,920
Commodus struck him again.

1783
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:16,200
Then he raised his arms to the crowd.

1784
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:20,960
One or two people shouted, "Commodus!" The crowd loved a
winner.

1785
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:23,680
Maximus almost fell again.

1786
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,840
The sun was bright, very bright.

1787
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:31,920
And then suddenly, beyond all this, he saw the sun shining
on a pink wall...

1788
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:36,760
He saw a gate in the wall... and a field of apple trees
beyond it...

1789
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:42,360
He pushed himself forward and, as he did so, he struck
Commodus.

1790
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:44,160
The crowd cheered.

1791
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:48,920
Commodus came forward again and knocked Maximus back to the
ground.

1792
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:50,360
The crowd were silent.

1793
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:53,400
Only the sound of the two men could be heard.

1794
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:56,160
Maximus saw something else now...

1795
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:01,080
A woman stood in the doorway of a pink stone house...

1796
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:03,920
There was a field of wheat behind the house...

1797
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:09,760
Commodus stood over Maximus with his sword ready for the
kill.

1798
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:16,040
"Maximus!" One person in the crowd called out in the
silence.

1799
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:18,080
Commodus looked around, angrily.

1800
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:20,440
The crowd repeated the cry.

1801
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:25,600
"Maximus!" Commodus turned back and brought his sword down.

1802
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:31,360
But the sound of the crowd had brought Maximus back to the
arena and given him new strength.

1803
02:32:31,360 --> 02:32:34,680
He pushed his sword up and knocked Commodus's sword away.

1804
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:39,480
Suddenly he got to his feet and attacked the Emperor,
forcing him back.

1805
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:41,040
The crowd cheered loudly.

1806
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:45,760
Then Maximus saw an opportunity and pushed his sword
forward.

1807
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:49,400
It caught Commodus under his arm and he dropped his sword.

1808
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,560
Commodus called to Quintus.

1809
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:54,160
"Give me your sword!"

1810
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:57,200
But Quintus just stared through him.

1811
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:00,560
Commodus turned to the guards.

1812
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:03,960
"A sword! Give me a sword!"

1813
02:33:03,960 --> 02:33:08,040
Some started to come forward, but Quintus stopped them.

1814
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:10,200
"Put your swords away!" he ordered.

1815
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:13,280
Commodus looked around, suddenly frightened.

1816
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:19,160
He saw the great crowd and heard the name of his enemy on
all sides.

1817
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:24,480
"Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!" they shouted.

1818
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:26,080
Senators joined in the cry.

1819
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:29,680
Juba and the gladiators shouted the name, too.

1820
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:33,600
Lucilla stood in silence, her hand to her mouth.

1821
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,800
But Maximus was dying.

1822
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,480
He could not stand.

1823
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:41,240
He dropped his own sword.

1824
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:51,600
He seemed to be reaching out toward something... a pink stone wall with a gate... a wheat field... the sound of a
child's laugh...

1825
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:58,400
Commodus saw Maximus fall to his knees and he stood over
him.

1826
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:05,800
He took the small knife in his hand again and lifted it,
ready to strike Maximus one last time.

1827
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:09,240
Maximus saw the knife coming toward him.

1828
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:13,880
He held Commodus's arm and pulled him onto the ground.

1829
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:21,480
Suddenly finding power from somewhere, Maximus turned the
knife around and pushed it deep into Commodus's neck.

1830
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:28,040
There was a look of surprise on the Emperor's face, then he
took one last breath and died.

1831
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:37,520
Maximus slowly stood, took one step forward, and reached out
a hand.

1832
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:39,760
Quintus went to him.

1833
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:42,480
"Maximus..."

1834
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:46,760
"Quintus, free my men," said Maximus.

1835
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:50,960
The crowd was completely quiet.

1836
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:57,080
Maximus saw his own hand on the gate, pushing it open...

1837
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:01,120
Walking away from him was a woman, and a child running...

1838
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:03,640
They looked back and smiled at him...

1839
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:06,080
Maximus fell to the sand.

1840
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:14,200
Out of the silence, Lucilla crossed the arena to the place
where he lay.

1841
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:16,000
She took him in her arms.

1842
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:22,560
She could see that she could not save him, but she wanted
him to hear her before the end.

1843
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:26,040
"Maximus," Lucilla said softly.

1844
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:31,000
Maximus's dying eyes opened again.

1845
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,360
"Lucius is safe?" he asked.

1846
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:37,320
"Yes."

1847
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:38,840
"Our sons live."

1848
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:42,760
Lucilla smiled.

1849
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:55,920
"Our sons live. And they are proud." She kissed him, crying,
and whispered, "Go to them. You're home."

1850
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,600
Maximus walked through the wheat field...

1851
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:04,080
The beautiful woman stopped and turned.

1852
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:05,920
She called to the boy.

1853
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:08,400
He stopped running and looked back.

1854
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:16,480
The boy then started running back along the road, toward the man in the wheat field, toward his father, who was coming
home at last.

1855
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:22,680
Maximus died in Lucilla's arms, as she placed him gently on
the sand.

1856
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:27,080
When she stood up, the whole arena was watching her.

1857
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:29,360
She turned and spoke to the senators.

1858
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:32,680
"Rome is free again," she said.

1859
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:42,600
Lucilla stood over Maximus's body as Gracchus and the
senators came down onto the sand.

1860
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:45,160
"He was a soldier of Rome," Lucilla said.

1861
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:47,880
"Honor him."

1862
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:53,640
Quintus's voice rang out, "Free the prisoners!"

1863
02:36:53,640 --> 02:37:02,880
A hand turned a key, and Juba led the last of Proximo's
gladiators into the silent arena.

1864
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:04,440
Gracchus stood by the body.

1865
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:08,000
"Who will help me carry this man?"

1866
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:15,040
A few voices broke the silence, calling Maximus's name.

1867
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,840
Then many more voices joined in.

1868
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:19,360
The sound grew and filled the arena.

1869
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:23,560
The gladiators picked Maximus up on their shoulders.

1870
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:30,600
Silent and proud, following Gracchus and the other senators
in a slow march, they carried him out of the arena.

1871
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:41,000
Lucilla stood for a long time, watching them go, while her
mad brother lay dead on the bloody sand behind her.

1872
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:42,640
CHAPTER TWELVE

1873
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:44,080
Home, At Last

1874
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:50,000
The games had ended.

1875
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:57,840
The Colosseum was empty and silent as Juba walked across the
sand.

1876
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:02,960
Juba, now dressed in his African clothes, was a free man
again.

1877
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:05,160
And soon he was going home.

1878
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:08,360
He still heard one voice in the arena, though.

1879
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:18,040
He heard Maximus, the great fighter, asking about his home
in Africa and talking to him about his own home in Spain.

1880
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:26,120
Juba moved to the center of the arena and found the exact
place he was looking for: a small area of blood on the sand.

1881
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:30,960
He dropped to his knees and made a little hole in the
ground.

1882
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:37,600
He took something from his pocket-the small wooden figures
of Maximus's wife and son.

1883
02:38:37,720 --> 02:38:44,160
He carefully put them in the hole and covered them with the
earth that carried their loved one's blood.

1884
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:49,520
Now it would be easier for them to find each other in the
next world.

1885
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:58,720
"Now we are free," he said loudly, looking around at the
empty, silent arena.

1886
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:03,160
"This place will become dust, but I will not forget you."

1887
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:09,200
He stood above the place where Maximus had died.

1888
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:11,560
"I will see you again," he said to his friend.

1889
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:21,640
He smiled the wide smile that he had smiled for Maximus in
life and would soon smile for his own wife and daughters.

1890
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:23,440
"But not yet."

1891
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:41,360
He walked slowly out of the arena, looking back just once at the place, as the wind blew red flowers across the killing
ground.
