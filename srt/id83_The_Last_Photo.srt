1
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,229
It is Saturday afternoon.

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:11,790
Martin and his sister Pam are in Cambridge
for the day.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,830
They are looking at the beautiful old buildings
of this University City.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,390
Pam has a camera with her.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,900
She likes taking photos and sometimes they
are very good.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,860
But sometimes they are not very good and Martin
laughs at them.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,399
It is five o'clock.

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,310
Pam and Martin are going home now.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,500
They are tired after their long day.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,420
They are in the garden near the bus station.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,170
"Let's have a last photo of you," says Pam.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,989
"Oh no, not again," says Martin.

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,090
"Come on," says Pam.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,550
"It's the last one, I want to finish the film
in my camera."

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,109
"Oh, all right," says Martin,

16
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:01,579
He stands in front of the flowers.

17
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,519
"Look at me," says Pam and takes a photo.

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,190
A man with a big rucksack on his back walks
between Pam and Martin.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,190
"Oh no," says Pam.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,410
"Now I've got a picture of that man, not of
you, Martin."

21
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,260
The man looks at Pam.

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,650
He is angry.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,360
He goes across the road without a word.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,040
"That man isn't very nice, is he?" says Martin.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,790
"No," says Pam.

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,130
"And that was the last picture on the film,
too."

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,030
The man with the rucksack on his back goes
into the bus station.

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,750
He has got sunglasses and a blue hat.

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,630
"Come on," says Martin.

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,750
"Let's find our bus."

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,150
They go into the bus station.

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,780
"Look," says Martin.

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,820
"There's that man again.

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,480
He's getting into that bus.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,090
He's going to Aberdeen.

36
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,130
That's in Scotland."

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,360
"Good," says Pam.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,479
"Far from here and far from me!"

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,550
She is angry with the man.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,330
Three days later, on Tuesday, Pam has got
her photos from the shop.

41
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,540
"Look at these," she says to Martin.

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,120
"They're the photos of us in Cambridge."

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,110
"Oh, these are all very good," says Martin.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,319
"But not this last one," says Pam.

45
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,870
"Look, it's that man with the rucksack."

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,590
In the photo, the man is in front of Martin.

47
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,950
You cannot see Martin behind the man's rucksack.

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,290
"Wait a minute," says Martin.

49
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,160
"I know that face.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
It's in the newspaper.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
Have you got it?"

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,230
"Today's newspaper?" says Pam.

53
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,970
"Yes, it's here.

54
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,040
Why?"

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,840
"Yes, here he is.

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,569
Look at this picture," says Martin.

57
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:06,550
Pam looks at the photo in the newspaper.

58
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,430
"Who's that?"

59
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,650
she asks.

60
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,450
"It says in the paper his name's Alan Rook,"
says Martin.

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,360
"And he works in a bank in London.

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,240
But on Monday morning - yesterday morning
- no Alan Rook!

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,980
The people at the bank don't know where he
is.

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,750
And they say he's got a hundred thousand pounds
with him.

65
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,840
The police are looking for him, too."

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,150
"But is that the man in my photo?" asks Pam.

67
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,700
"He hasn't got a beard and he hasn't any hair."

68
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,380
"Look at his ears.

69
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,470
Look at his nose," says Martin.

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,180
"It's him.

71
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,640
I know it is."

72
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,740
Martin has an idea.

73
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,070
He takes a pencil and starts to draw on the
newspaper.

74
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,090
"What are you doing?" asks Pam.

75
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,360
"Look," says Martin.

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,319
"I'm putting dark glasses and a two-day beard
on the man in this photo.

77
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,300
Now I'm drawing a hat on his head.

78
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,730
See?

79
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,010
Now look at the two pictures."

80
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,530
"You're right," says Pam.

81
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,019
"It's him.

82
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,360
It's Alan Rook."

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,090
"Come on," says Martin.

84
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,190
"Let's take these pictures to the police."

85
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,280
At the police station Pam and Martin, speak
to a policeman.

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,890
They put Pam's photo and the newspaper on
the table and they tell their story.

87
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,410
"That's Alan Rook," says the policeman, "In
Cambridge at 5 o'clock on Saturday.

88
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,110
The big question is - where is he now?"

89
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,470
"We think we know.

90
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,320
He's in Scotland, in Aberdeen," says Pam,
"Or he's near there."

91
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,530
They tell the policeman about the man and
the bus to Aberdeen.

92
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,320
"He's got a rucksack and a tent on his back
in the photo," says the policeman.

93
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,630
"He Isn't living in a hotel.

94
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,310
He's camping.

95
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,979
If we're lucky, he's still in Scotland.

96
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,160
I must make a telephone call."

97
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,010
The policeman telephones the police station
in Aberdeen.

98
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,389
"Alan Rook's in Scotland," he says.

99
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,530
"We think he's camping near Aberdeen.

100
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,560
He's got a short beard now," The next day
the police in Aberdeen find Alan Rook in a

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,919
tent in the mountains near Aberdeen.

102
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,460
The money from the bank is in his rucksack.

103
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,120
The next morning Pam and Martin's story is
in all the newspapers.

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,250
There is Pam's photo of Alan Rook at the bus
station.

105
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,630
There is a picture of Martin and Pam, too.

106
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,430
In the newspaper, it says:

107
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,490
CAMERA GIRL GETS PHOTO OF ROOK POLICE IN ABERDEEN
FIND BANK MONEY

108
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,710
The people at the bank are very happy.

109
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,910
They give Pam and Martin a thousand pounds.

110
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,540
"My last photo's a good one after all," laughs
Pam.

111
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,850
"Now I can buy a very good new camera."

112
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,090
- THE END -
