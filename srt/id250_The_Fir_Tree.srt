CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:36,020
The Tree in the Forest

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,760
Just outside a village, there was a beautiful
forest.

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,120
It was full of so many kinds of trees.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,289
On the edge of the forest, there was a pretty
Fir tree.

6
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,590
He was still a small tree.

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,559
He lived in a very nice place.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,220
There was a lot of sunshine and fresh air.

9
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,909
Around him, there were many other fir trees.

10
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,330
Some were much bigger and others were the
same size.

11
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,600
There were also many pine trees.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,100
They all looked so big.

13
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,409
He wanted to be big too.

14
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,290
His life was very good.

15
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,869
But he did not know that.

16
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:38,710
He did not care about the warm sunshine or
fresh air.

17
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,710
Many children came to pick strawberries in
the woods.

18
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,159
Sometimes, they sat under the little Fir tree.

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,060
They often said, "Let's sit under that little
Fir tree.

20
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,880
It is so pretty."

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,330
But the Fir tree did not like this.

22
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:12,800
He did not like being 'little.'

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,300
Every year, the Fir tree grew bigger.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,910
But he was still not happy.

25
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,720
He looked at other trees around him.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,830
He thought, "I want to be big like those trees.

27
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,629
I want to have big branches with many leaves.

28
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,349
I want to stand tall, and see many things
in the sky.

29
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:47,140
I want birds to build nests in my branches.

30
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,540
I want to bend elegantly in the wind."

31
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,870
He was never happy.

32
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,850
Two more years went by and he grew and grew.

33
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,769
He was now much bigger.

34
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,820
"I am getting bigger," he thought.

35
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,129
"Grow!

36
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:24,830
I must grow taller!"

37
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,270
Every autumn, the woodcutters came to cut
down the largest trees.

38
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,960
The Fir tree heard the sounds "Chop!

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,659
Chop!

40
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,360
Chop!"

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:47,080
Then, there was a "Crash!!"

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,239
The trees tumbled down.

43
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,129
The Fir tree became very frightened.

44
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:02,870
The Fir tree thought, "Why did the men cut
down the trees?

45
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,770
Where did they go?

46
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:13,909
What will happen to them?"

47
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,709
He saw some swallows, and asked them.

48
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,700
"Yes, I think I saw them," they answered.

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,650
"I flew to Egypt and I saw many ships.

50
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,280
On the ships, there were gigantic masts.

51
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,710
They had huge white sails and danced in the
wind.

52
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,479
They were very elegant.

53
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,210
You should be proud."

54
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,760
This made the Fir tree happy.

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,130
He thought, "I want to sail across the sea.

56
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,669
I want to be a gigantic mast with dancing
sails.

57
00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:00,190
I would be so happy."

58
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,650
The air and the sunshine heard the tree and
said, "Don't wish for another life.

59
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,550
Be happy now.

60
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,949
You have warm sunlight.

61
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:15,550
You have a healthy trunk."

62
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:29,740
But the tree did not understand them.

63
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,650
This year, the woodcutters came before Christmas.

64
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,840
They did not cut down big trees.

65
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,740
They cut down young trees.

66
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,139
The Fir tree was very confused.

67
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,560
"Why are they cutting down such young trees?"

68
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,180
There were some sparrows sitting in his branches.

69
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,069
So the Fir tree asked them, "Where are the
trees going?

70
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,280
Those are smaller than me.

71
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:10,349
Why did the men cut them down?"

72
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,060
This time, the Sparrows said, "We know!

73
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,419
We looked in through some windows in the village.

74
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,030
The trees will go there.

75
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,530
They will be so beautiful.

76
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,479
They will wear so many colors and lights.

77
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,990
They will be so happy.

78
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:39,030
They will live in a warm room with many presents
under them."

79
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,810
The Fir tree was very interested in this.

80
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,840
The tree thought, "It sounds wonderful.

81
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,289
It is better than sailing across the sea.

82
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,410
I want to live in such a place.

83
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,650
I suffer so much in this forest!

84
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,699
Something better must be waiting for me."

85
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:08,140
Again, the sunlight and the air heard the
tree.

86
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,300
They said to him, "Do not be so foolish.

87
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,720
Your life in the forest is the best.

88
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,100
Be happy with that."

89
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,949
But the tree ignored them.

90
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,690
Finally, the woodcutters came.

91
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:39,409
They stood in front of him, and said, "This
one will be perfect."

92
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:44,240
A few moments later, the tree felt a sharp
pain.

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,920
It was the axe.

94
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,909
Whack!

95
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,900
Whack!

96
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,880
Whack!

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,580
He fell to the ground.

98
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,379
Crash!!

99
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,759
It was not the happiness he dreamed of.

100
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,030
He suddenly felt very sad.

101
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:19,620
He thought, "My home!

102
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,440
I am separated from my home.

103
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,530
I will never see it again.

104
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,560
I will never feel the fresh air or the warm
sunlight.

105
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,279
I will never hear the birds sing again.

106
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:52,620
I am so sad."

107
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
CHAPTER TWO

108
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:19,800
A Very Sad Life

109
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,360
The Fir tree was put into a large room.

110
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,690
He looked around the room curiously.

111
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,130
Soon after, many servants and young girls
came in.

112
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,200
They started to decorate the tree.

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,550
They hung many colored decorations on the
tree.

114
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:47,620
On the top, they put a large golden star.

115
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,330
The tree looked at his branches.

116
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,230
He was dressed in many colors.

117
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,399
He looked very beautiful.

118
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,190
"Now my life will be wonderful," thought the
tree.

119
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,980
"I will live my life in this warm room.

120
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,540
The sunlight and the air were all wrong.

121
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,880
Maybe the sparrows will come to see me.

122
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,600
Maybe they will tell other trees about my
grand life."

123
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,950
He was so happy now.

124
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:37,930
He felt very good about his future.

125
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,950
A few moments later, the door to the room
opened.

126
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,300
Many children came in.

127
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,890
They ran to the tree and stopped.

128
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,850
Just after them, the adults walked in.

129
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:58,420
Together, they all admired the beautiful tree.

130
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,260
The tree felt so happy.

131
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,170
It was very noisy in that room that night.

132
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:16,350
The children screamed joyfully and danced
around the tree.

133
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,970
Later, all the people sang Christmas carols
together.

134
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,940
The tree enjoyed watching all of this.

135
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,670
He thought, "This is all for me!

136
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,760
I will enjoy this every night."

137
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:47,540
He was very content.

138
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,420
The next morning, the tree wanted to see the
children.

139
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,639
But they did not come to see him.

140
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,820
Instead, some servants came into the room.

141
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,630
He thought, "Yesterday, the servants decorated
me.

142
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,579
Today, they will decorate me again."

143
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,000
But this did not happen.

144
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,970
The servants pulled the tree down.

145
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,470
They took him out of the room.

146
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:28,130
Then, they took him up many stairs and put
him into a dark room.

147
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:36,670
He was forgotten.

148
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,670
Many more lonely nights passed.

149
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,730
One night, there was a sound, "Squeak!

150
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,100
Squeak!"

151
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,490
They were little mice.

152
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,430
The curious mice wanted to know about the
tree.

153
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,300
The tree told stories about the forest.

154
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,560
They were amazed.

155
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,260
They said, "Your life is interesting!

156
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,120
You were very happy in the forest!"

157
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,460
The tree replied, "Yes, I was happy there.

158
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,810
But my life is not interesting anymore."

159
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:25,800
At night they went to hear his story.

160
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,670
He told them many stories about Christmas
Eve.

161
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,440
This continued for a few more nights.

162
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:44,730
Finally, the tree had no more stories and
had to tell the same stories over.

163
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,149
The mice thought, "Maybe the stories are not
very interesting after all."

164
00:13:50,149 --> 00:14:00,050
So, the mice did not go to the tree at night.

165
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:06,519
It became very lonely in that dark room.

166
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:13,839
"Why don't the mice come to visit me?" he
thought.

167
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,550
"It was better when the mice came to listen
to me.

168
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,140
I must enjoy those happy times more.

169
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,040
I will be careful next time.

170
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,450
When I leave this room, I will really enjoy
everything.

171
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,330
But when will that be?"

172
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:43,360
One day, the door to that dark, lonely room
opened.

173
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,620
Many people came in.

174
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,930
"At last," thought the tree.

175
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:56,680
"They come to give me a new life."

176
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,920
One man came and pushed the tree down onto
the floor.

177
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,800
Ouch!!

178
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,240
The tree landed very heavily.

179
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:23,510
Then two servants picked up the tree and took
it outside.

180
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,550
Now the tree was lying in the sunlight.

181
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,310
"This is wonderful.

182
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,019
My new life is beginning.

183
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:33,750
It is spring now.

184
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:41,139
They will plant me and I will grow."

185
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,880
The tree really enjoyed the fresh air.

186
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
He looked around at the garden.

187
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,450
It was so beautiful.

188
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,120
There were roses and carnations.

189
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,630
He saw many birds flying in the garden.

190
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:09,670
It was a wonderful day for the tree.

191
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,920
The tree relaxed in the sunlight, and spread
out his branches.

192
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,389
Just then, he discovered something terrible.

193
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,019
He couldn't move his branches.

194
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,240
He looked at them and was shocked.

195
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
They were all yellow.

196
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,660
His branches were weak.

197
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:39,630
He was a very sad tree now.

198
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,270
Some children were running around the garden.

199
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,960
They cried, "Look!

200
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,930
It is the Christmas tree.

201
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,580
It is so old and ugly.

202
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
But look!

203
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,839
It still has the yellow star on top of it."

204
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:03,260
One of the children took the star from the
tree.

205
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,189
The children didn't care about the old tree.

206
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:19,860
There was nothing beautiful about the tree
anymore.

207
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:32,780
"This is terrible," he thought.

208
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,270
"I really am an old, ugly tree.

209
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,750
I want to go back to my dark, lonely room.

210
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,000
My life in the forest really was the best.

211
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,470
I wasted my life.

212
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,900
I always wished for something more interesting.

213
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,360
I never enjoyed the simple things in my life.

214
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,290
Now, it is over.

215
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,260
There is nothing I can do."

216
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,789
Soon, the gardener came with an axe.

217
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:15,000
"This really is the end," groaned the tree.

218
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,970
He chopped the poor Fir tree into many pieces.

219
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,250
Then, he placed each piece into a fire.

220
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:31,669
The poor tree burned in the flames.

221
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:36,059
As he burned, he could see the children playing.

222
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,919
They were playing with his golden star.

223
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,679
But it was too late for regrets now.
