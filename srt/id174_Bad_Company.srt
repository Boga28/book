00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,840
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,880
A body on the beach

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,920
Noise. Headache. Dry mouth.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
Half asleep, Helen Shepherd turned 
over in bed, but the noise didn't stop.  

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
A moment later she woke up.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,640
The noise. It was her phone. She took 
it off the table next to her bed.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,680
'Yes?' she said. Her dry mouth 
made it difficult to talk.  

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,160
And her head hurt quite badly. 
Too much wine last night!

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,280
'Is that Detective Inspector 
Shepherd?' asked a voice.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,800
'Yes,' said Shepherd.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,600
'I'm sorry to wake you,' said the voice. The 
voice waited for Shepherd to say something,  

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,000
but she didn't. She looked at 
the clock. It was six thirty.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:27,120
'Er, well, my name's Webb,' said the voice. 
'Brian Webb. I'm your new sergeant. I start  

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:37,600
working for you today. Well, this morning, 
actually. Erm... I'm sorry to wake you up, but...'

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,640
'Sergeant,' said Shepherd. 'People call 
me at all times of the day and night.  

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
Forget the "sorry". Just 
tell me what the problem is.'

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,680
'There's a body on the 
beach,' said Webb. 'In Hythe.  

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,600
About two hundred metres from 
the Grand Hotel. I'm there now.'

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,920
'I'll be twenty minutes,' replied Shepherd 
and put her phone back down on the table.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
Shepherd stood under the shower for five minutes.  

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
The hot water got the blood 
moving around her tired body.

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:30,080
She drank half a litre of water and took three 
aspirins. Five minutes later she was in her car.

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
The drive from her house in Folkestone to 
Hythe took Shepherd less than ten minutes.  

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,880
It was the start of autumn and small seaside 
towns like Hythe were becoming quiet again  

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,840
after the busy summer. The school holidays 
were over, the beaches were almost empty,  

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
and this early in the morning 
there were few cars on the roads.

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,480
As she came into Hythe, Shepherd passed the Sea 
view Cafe on her right. It was just opening for  

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,360
breakfast. Two hundred metres down the road, also 
on the right, she could see a large building - the  

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,840
Grand Hotel. On her left was the sea wall. And 
on the other side of the wall were the beach  

30
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,880
and the sea. There were a number of cars by the 
side of the road. Shepherd stopped behind them.

31
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,880
She looked quickly at herself in the car mirror:  

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,520
grey-blonde hair tied back, intelligent 
eyes, small nose, thin mouth.  

33
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:57,200
'I don't look too bad,' she thought. But she 
felt tired and old, and her head still hurt.

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,800
She got out of her car and looked over the wall.  

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:12,320
A cold wind was coming off the sea. The sun 
was only just up. About fifty metres along  

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,680
the beach some people were standing around 
and looking down at something. The body.

37
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,320
One of them, a young man in a blue 
suit, looked round and saw Shepherd.

38
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
'That must be Webb,' thought 
Shepherd. 'He looks about sixteen.'

39
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,840
It was true what people said: as you 
get older, police officers look younger.

40
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
Webb came to meet Shepherd as she walked over.

41
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,000
'I'm Brian Webb, madam,' he 
said. 'Your new sergeant.'

42
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
'I know,' said Shepherd.

43
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
'You know?' asked Webb.

44
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,200
'Yes, Sergeant,' replied Shepherd. She 
waved a hand at the others. 'You're the  

45
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,440
only person here I don't know, so you must be 
my new sergeant. I'm a detective, remember.'

46
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,960
'Oh!' said Webb, looking down and then up again.

47
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
Shepherd looked him in the eye.

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,080
'And don't call me madam,' she said. 'It's 
Shep. That's what everyone calls me.'

49
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,640
'Right, madam - Shep,' said Webb.

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
'OK,' said Shepherd. 'Let's 
go and see what we've got.'

51
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
They walked over to the other people. On the beach  

52
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,080
was the body of a young woman wearing a dark blue 
skirt, a white blouse and a short red jacket.  

53
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,520
She had a pretty face and short blonde hair. 
The back of her head was dark with blood.

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
A man in white clothes was down 
on one knee looking at the body.  

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
He heard Shepherd arrive and looked up.

56
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
'Morning, Shep,' he said.

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
'Dr Atkinson,' replied Shep.

58
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
Atkinson stood up and took the 
plastic gloves off his hands.

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,400
'It's murder,' he said. 'Someone hit her 
on the back of the head. It killed her.'

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
'Hit her with what?' asked Shepherd.

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,440
'I don't know at the moment,' answered Atkinson. 
He looked up and down the beach. 'But it could  

62
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,640
still be here on the beach. Not a stone, I don't 
think. Something longer. A piece of wood, maybe.'

63
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,560
Shepherd looked up and down the beach. There 
were lots of bits of wood, brought in by the sea.

64
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,320
'What time did she die?' asked Shepherd.

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
'Late last night or early this 
morning,' replied Atkinson.  

66
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,400
'Say between eleven and two. I 
can probably tell you more later.'

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,080
'OK, thanks,' said Shepherd.

68
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,880
She said nothing for a moment and just looked 
out to sea. Her head was feeling better already.  

69
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Three aspirins and a dead body - a quick 
way to make a headache go away. Not funny  

70
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:33,280
really - not for the poor woman dead on the 
beach. 'Excuse me, ma-, I mean Shep,' said Webb.

71
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
Shepherd looked at him. Webb moved 
uncomfortably from one foot to the other.  

72
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
He was a bit like a young dog, 
wanting to please her all the time.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,840
'The man who found her... er, the body,' 
began Webb. 'He's a waiter at the Grand Hotel  

74
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,080
and he thinks she was staying there. Well, 
actually, he's quite sure she was staying there.'

75
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
'And where is he now?' asked Shepherd.

76
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,720
'Erm... he's at the hotel,' replied 
Webb. 'He had to go to work.'

77
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,240
'What?' said Shepherd, giving Webb an angry look.

78
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,920
'Well... erm... he was late 
already,' replied Webb.

79
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,520
And what if I want to speak to 
him?' asked Shepherd. 'Now?'

80
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,880
'Well...' Webb looked more 
uncomfortable. 'I can always.'

81
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:44,000
'No,' said Shepherd. 'Later. First, I want you to 
get as many officers as you can down here on the  

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,400
beach. They're looking for the piece of wood 
or some other thing that killed this woman.'

83
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
'Right, Shep,' replied Webb.

84
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Shepherd turned to Dr Atkinson.

85
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,680
'Let the photographer finish his work, 
then you can take the body away,' she said.

86
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,840
'OK, Shep,' replied Atkinson.

87
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,880
Shepherd walked back up the beach 
and sat on the top of the sea wall,  

88
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,800
enjoying the smell of the sea air. She 
looked in her bag for some cigarettes,  

89
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,840
then remembered she didn't smoke any more. 
Three weeks without a cigarette - not bad.

90
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,280
She watched Webb finish his call. 'He must 
be one of these university police officers,'  

91
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,840
she thought. 'They leave 
university, become a police officer,  

92
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,760
then a sergeant by the age of twenty-five, 
and know little about real police work.'

93
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,320
Webb walked up the beach to Shepherd.

94
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,400
'Have you worked on many murders 
before, Sergeant?' asked Shepherd.

95
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,000
'No, Shep,' he replied. 'Not 
many. Well, not any really.'

96
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,440
'So,' thought Shepherd, 'this could be a 
difficult job for Webb - his first murder.'

97
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,800
'The first twenty-four hours are the most 
important,' said Shepherd. 'Don't forget that.'

98
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,080
'Yes. I mean no. I won't,' replied Webb.

99
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,880
'I want the person who did this,' said Shepherd. 
'And I want him or her by this time tomorrow.  

100
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
After that our job starts to get more difficult.'

101
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,920
'Right, Shep,' said Webb.

102
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:48,240
'Now,' said Shepherd. 'You go to the Grand Hotel. 
Talk to the waiter who found the body. Find out  

103
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,840
who the dead woman is and what she was doing here. 
And get us a room where we can talk to people.'

104
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
'OK, Shep,' said Webb.

105
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
'I'm going over the road for 
some breakfast,' said Shepherd,  

106
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,120
looking at the Seaview Cafe. 'I'll 
see you at the hotel in half an hour.'

107
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,680
Webb watched Shepherd walk over to the cafe.

108
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,920
'She wants the job done quickly,' he thought 
to himself, 'but first she wants breakfast.  

109
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
This could be a long and difficult day.'
 
 
 

110
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,400
CHAPTER TWO

111
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,000
McNab Music International

112
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,760
Twenty-five minutes later Shepherd walked 
through the front doors of the Grand Hotel.  

113
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,640
She felt much better after a bacon 
sandwich and a cup of coffee.  

114
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,080
It was eight o'clock and Webb was waiting 
for her. There were a number of comfortable  

115
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,880
sofas and chairs near the front desk, but at this 
time in the morning not many people were around.

116
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,360
'I've got us a room,' said Webb, leading 
the way to the back of the hotel.  

117
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,640
'It's the Wells room - named after 
H.G. Wells, the famous writer.  

118
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
Did you know that he lived near here 
- between Hythe and Folkestone?'

119
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,520
'No,' said Shepherd, her voice uninterested.

120
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,640
Soon they came to a door 
with the word 'Wells' on it.

121
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
Webb opened the door.

122
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,840
'It's not a very large room,' he said. 'The 
hotel uses it for small meetings and parties.'

123
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,040
'It's fine,' said Shepherd 
looking round. There was a table  

124
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,840
in the centre of the room and four 
chairs down each side of the table.

125
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
Shepherd took a chair and waved 
a hand for Webb to sit down too.

126
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
'OK,' she said. 'What have you got?'

127
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:08,080
'The dead woman is Claudia Engel,' said Webb. 
He took a piece of paper from inside his jacket  

128
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,280
and looked at it. 'She's German, but she lived in 
London. She was here with three other people from  

129
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,920
a company called MMI - McNab Music International. 
They're a music company from London.

130
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
They use the hotel for 
meetings from time to time.'

131
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
'Who are the others?' asked Shepherd.

132
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Webb looked down at his piece of paper again.  

133
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,680
'James McNab. It's his company. Then 
there's Ajit Chowdury and Harriet Johnson.'

134
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Just then the door opened. A man 
came into the room and stopped.  

135
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,480
He was tall, in his early forties, clean-shaven 
and good-looking. He was well dressed:  

136
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:05,840
expensive dark grey suit, clean white shirt and 
red tie. Shepherd could almost smell the money.

137
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,440
The man looked at Webb, then at Shepherd.

138
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,640
'I'm James McNab,' he said to Shepherd. 
'Your sergeant said you wanted to see me.'  

139
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,320
His voice was rather high for a tall man. 'I 
asked him why, but he said he couldn't tell me.'

140
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Shepherd got the feeling that this 
was a man who liked to be the boss.  

141
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,360
He certainly didn't mind walking 
into a room without knocking first.

142
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,440
'Well, what's the problem?' said 
McNab, looking at his watch.  

143
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,560
'I've got a meeting at nine 
o'clock and a lot to do before it.'

144
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,360
With Webb so new to the job, 
Shepherd couldn't see him  

145
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,840
asking many questions. She looked at 
McNab and tried to decide how to begin.  

146
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,480
'I'd like him to feel less sure of 
himself from the beginning,' she thought.

147
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,840
'Does Claudia Engel work for you?' asked Shepherd.

148
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
'Yes, she does,' replied McNab. 'And?'

149
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,600
'I'm afraid I've got some bad news,' said 
Shepherd. 'We found a body on the beach  

150
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,480
this morning. We believe it is Claudia Engel. 
We also believe that someone murdered her.'

151
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:41,600
'What?' McNab's mouth fell open. 'Claudia? 
I don't believe it. It can't be true.'

152
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,280
'I'm afraid it is,' said Shepherd.

153
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,320
'That's terrible!' said McNab. 'Terrible!'

154
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,720
'I need to ask you some questions,' 
said Shepherd. 'Take a seat.'

155
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,440
'Well,' said McNab, looking at his watch 
again. 'Of course, I'll do what I can to help.'  

156
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
He pulled a chair out and sat down.

157
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,080
'Tell me why you're here in Hythe,' said Shepherd.

158
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,920
McNab took a moment to think. He 
looked at Webb and then at Shepherd.

159
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,120
'Two or three times a year we come here for a day 
or two,' he began. 'Our offices are in London, but  

160
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,600
it's sometimes easier to work without 
the phone going every five minutes.  

161
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,840
We come here to get away and 
talk about important business.'

162
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,280
'What important business?' asked Shepherd.

163
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,080
McNab moved on his chair. 'Why 
do you want to know?' he asked.  

164
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
'I don't like to tell people too much about 
our business. Do you need to know this?'

165
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,360
Shepherd put both hands on the table and sat up.

166
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,040
'Mr McNab,' she said quietly, a hard look 
in her eyes, 'we're talking about a murder.  

167
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,680
I'm going to ask any question I 
want and you're going to answer it.'

168
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,560
McNab put both hands up in front of 
him, as if keeping Shepherd away.  

169
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,160
'OK, OK,' he said. 'I was only asking.'

170
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,720
Shepherd sat back.

171
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,200
McNab put his hands down 
and started speaking again.  

172
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:44,960
'MMI is a music company. We make and sell CDs. 
We sell music over the internet. We work with  

173
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,400
musicians. Anything to do with music, we do 
it - like I say, we're in the music business.'

174
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
'So what did you come here to 
talk about?' asked Shepherd.

175
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,720
'We had to decide a number of things,' 
replied McNab, but said no more.

176
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,840
Shepherd looked at him. 'Mr 
McNab,' she said angrily,  

177
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,760
'this is going to be much easier if you help 
me. What things did you have to decide?'

178
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,560
'We have some new bands we're interested 
in - we wanted to talk about them,'  

179
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,280
answered McNab, not looking at Shepherd. 'Two 
of them are very good. And I wanted to talk to  

180
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,840
the others about where the company 
is going over the next few years.'

181
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,920
'Tell me about the other people 
who work for you,' said Shepherd.

182
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,400
McNab looked happier now he was talking about the 
people in the company and not company business.

183
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,760
'Well, there's Ajit Chowdury,' said McNab. 'He's 
the money man, the company accountant. Harriet  

184
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:10,480
Johnson looks after sales. She sells MMI's music 
all round the world. And then Claudia looks...  

185
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,280
looked after the music side of things. The 
music itself, and the musicians and the bands.'

186
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
'And how does everyone get on?' asked Shepherd.

187
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,800
McNab thought for a moment.

188
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
'I think we get on well,' he said. 'Of course,  

189
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
we don't always agree with each other, but 
we're always adult about it. Nobody takes  

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,320
their ball home and says they don't want 
to play anymore, if you see what I mean.'

191
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,840
McNab smiled. Shepherd didn't smile back.

192
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,840
'Tell us about last night,' she said.

193
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,560
'There's not much to tell,' answered McNab. 'We 
worked until about five. Then we met in the bar  

194
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,920
sometime between seven and seven 
thirty. We had dinner together in  

195
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:12,080
the restaurant and finished about nine 
thirty. Then we went our different ways.  

196
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,840
I went to my room and watched TV for half an 
hour. Then I had a shower and went to bed.'

197
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,480
Shepherd looked at Webb to 
see if he had any questions.

198
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,480
'Did anything unusual happen 
yesterday evening?' he asked.

199
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,040
'Good question,' thought Shepherd. 'Maybe 
there's more to Webb than I thought.'

200
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,360
'No.' began McNab, but then 
he stopped and thought.  

201
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,640
'Actually, yes. There was something strange.'

202
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,480
Webb didn't say anything. He just 
waited for McNab to speak again.

203
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,480
'When we were in the bar,' said McNab, 'a 
man came in. As soon as he saw Claudia,  

204
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,880
he turned round and walked out again - 
but she saw him. It was very strange.  

205
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,800
Her face turned white. For a 
moment she looked terrible.  

206
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:26,320
We asked her if she was OK. She said yes, she was 
fine. She said it was just someone she once knew.'

207
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,040
'What did the man look like?' asked Webb.

208
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,520
'I really don't remember,' said 
McNab. 'Fair hair, not tall,  

209
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,600
not short, nothing unusual. I 
only saw him for a few seconds.'

210
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,800
Shepherd felt it was important 
to find out more about this man  

211
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
and decided to end the conversation, 
but McNab was speaking again.

212
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,240
'Inspector,' he said, 'I hope 
you find this man soon. I mean,  

213
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm sure the news of Claudia's 
murder will be in the newspapers.  

214
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
But I'd like to keep MMI away from 
this kind of news as much as I can.'

215
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,240
Shepherd smiled to herself. McNab, the 
boss, was looking after his company again.

216
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
'It'll take as long as it 
takes, Mr McNab,' she said.  

217
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:27,120
'I'll probably want to talk to you again, after 
we've spoken to Ms Johnson and Mr Chowdury. I'll  

218
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,360
also want my officers to look round all your hotel 
rooms. You can go now, but don't leave the hotel.'

219
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,840
McNab opened his mouth to say something, 
but then he saw the look in Shepherd's eye.  

220
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
He closed his mouth, looked at 
Webb, then back at Shepherd.

221
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,800
'Right,' he said.

222
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
'Thank you,' said Shepherd.

223
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,880
McNab left the room, closing the door behind him.

224
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
Shepherd turned to Webb.

225
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,600
'With people like McNab, you've got 
to let them know who's the boss,'  

226
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,240
she said. 'It's us - the police 
- not them. Don't forget that.'

227
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
'Right, Shep,' replied Webb.

228
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:21,520
'Now,' said Shepherd. 'Harriet Johnson next. But 
before that, we need to know more about that man  

229
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,600
who came into the bar last night. Get someone to 
ask around the hotel. Did anyone see a man - our  

230
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Mr X - come into the hotel between seven and seven 
thirty, go into the bar and then leave quickly?  

231
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,720
If so, who is he? I also want to know when Claudia 
Engel left the hotel. And was anyone with her?'

232
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,440
'OK,' said Webb. He stood up.

233
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,760
'And we need a look at these people's rooms,' 
said Shepherd, 'Engel's room and the other three.  

234
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,320
Two officers to each room. If they find 
anything strange or unusual, I want to know.'

235
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
'Right, Shep,' said Webb, going to the door.

236
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,680
'And, Sergeant?' said Shepherd.

237
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,080
'Yes,' said Webb.

238
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,960
Shepherd looked at her watch. It 
was too early for a glass of wine.

239
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,400
'Get someone to bring us some coffee.'
 
 
 

240
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,280
CHAPTER THREE

241
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
Questions for Ms Johnson

242
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,320
Harriet Johnson was wearing black jeans and 
a pink blouse. She had long dark hair and  

243
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,840
looked very sure of herself. She sat 
down in front of Shepherd and Webb.

244
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,520
'James told me the news,' she said. 
'I understand you want to talk to me.'

245
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:02,000
'Yes,' said Shepherd slowly, giving Johnson a 
long look. 'How well did you know Ms Engel?'

246
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,320
'Well enough,' replied Johnson. 
'We worked together for two years.'

247
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,840
Shepherd gave her another long 
look. Something was wrong.

248
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,960
'You don't look sad,' said Shepherd.

249
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,480
Johnson gave a short laugh.

250
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,520
'No, I don't, do I?' she said. Her 
mouth smiled, but not her eyes.  

251
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,280
'Well, I didn't like Claudia Engel 
at all. Actually, I hated her.'

252
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
Shepherd looked questioningly at Johnson.

253
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,440
'The old, old story,' said Johnson, again 
with a short laugh. 'I had a boyfriend.  

254
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,000
She took him away from me. They started going 
out while I thought he and I were still together.  

255
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,600
Then I found out what was happening. He 
left me for her - well, I told him not  

256
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,040
to come back actually. Then later she left him.'

257
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
'I see,' said Shepherd.

258
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,080
'She made me very unhappy. Then 
she made my boyfriend unhappy.  

259
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,000
Mind you, he never really did know what he 
wanted anyway. This all happened two years ago,  

260
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,960
when she started at MMI. It all meant nothing 
to her. But it didn't mean nothing to me.'

261
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,920
'And you hated her,' said Shepherd.

262
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
'I did,' said Johnson. 'I probably still do.'

263
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,920
'Yes,' thought Shepherd. 'You do.'  

264
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,640
She could almost feel the hate coming 
across from the other side of the table.

265
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,880
'But I didn't kill her,' said Johnson.

266
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,200
'How did the others feel about Engel?' 
asked Shepherd. 'McNab, Chowdury.'

267
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:04,800
Johnson smiled again. 'They didn't like 
her much,' she answered. 'Ajit Chowdury  

268
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,600
wanted her job. OK, he's the accountant, 
but he thinks he knows a lot about music.  

269
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,160
He doesn't want to sit in an office all day. He 
wants to be out and about with famous musicians.'

270
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,200
'And McNab?' asked Shepherd.

271
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:30,160
'Dear old James,' answered Johnson. 'He likes 
everyone to think he's the boss, doesn't he? But,  

272
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:38,080
actually... well, he's just a little bit afraid 
of women. You probably saw that, Inspector.'

273
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,800
For a moment Shepherd thought about 
smiling, but decided against the idea.

274
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,080
'Anyway,' Johnson was speaking again, 
'he was certainly afraid of Claudia.  

275
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,000
Over the last two years she was the real brains 
behind the company. The musicians loved her. She  

276
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,720
knew what music the public wanted to buy. And 
James knew he just had to agree to her ideas.'

277
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,480
'How long have you worked 
for MMI?' asked Shepherd.

278
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,840
'Fifteen years,' answered Johnson. 
'Since James started the company.'

279
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,560
'And the company is doing well?' asked Shepherd.

280
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:31,040
'Fine,' replied Johnson quickly. 
Too quickly maybe, thought Shepherd.

281
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,640
'Some of our musicians are big names all 
over the world,' said Johnson. 'And we're  

282
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,840
taking on two new bands. I haven't heard 
them, but people say they're excellent.'

283
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,920
'Tell us about last night,' said Shepherd.

284
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,480
Johnson told Webb and Shepherd about the 
four of them having drinks in the bar.

285
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,560
'Then we had dinner,' said Johnson. 
'We finished about nine thirty.'

286
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,440
'McNab told us about a man who came into the bar.  

287
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,880
Someone Claudia Engel knew,' said 
Shepherd. 'You haven't told us about him.'

288
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,720
'I didn't see him,'  

289
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,400
replied Johnson. 'I had my back to the door, 
and by the time I turned round, he was gone.'

290
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,560
'But you're sure Ms Engel knew 
him?' Shepherd made it a question.

291
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,400
'Oh yes,' said Johnson. 'The look 
on her face told me that. Actually,  

292
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,720
I think she met him later. 
She certainly met someone.'

293
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Shepherd looked questioningly at Johnson.

294
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,200
After dinner I sat in the lounge, had a 
coffee and read a book,' began Johnson.  

295
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,080
'While I was there, Claudia came down from 
her room and went out of the front doors.  

296
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,960
From where I was sitting I could see 
through the doors - they're glass - and  

297
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,240
she was standing there. Outside. Waiting. 
I'm sure she was waiting for someone.  

298
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,200
Then she walked away to the left. It was as 
if she could see the person she was meeting.'

299
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,440
'Why did you think that?' asked Shepherd.

300
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,920
'Just the way she was walking,' said Johnson.

301
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,680
'But you didn't see the person 
she was meeting?' asked Shepherd.

302
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,880
'No,' said Johnson. 'It was too dark.'

303
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,120
'What time was this?' asked Shepherd.

304
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,440
'Probably about ten thirty,' answered 
Johnson. 'Maybe ten forty-five.  

305
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,640
I went up to my room soon after that.' 
She moved uncomfortably on her chair.

306
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,720
'And you didn't see Ms Engel 
again?' asked Shepherd.

307
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,840
'No,' replied Johnson.

308
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,960
Shepherd looked at Webb.

309
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,480
'There's salt on your shoes,' he said to Johnson.

310
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
'What do you mean?' asked Johnson.

311
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,360
'They're white round the bottoms,' 
said Webb. 'That's salt. From the sea.  

312
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,440
Have you been on the beach?'

313
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,720
Shepherd looked at Johnson's shoes.  

314
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,840
They were black trainers. And there 
was salt round the bottom of them.

315
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,640
'Not bad, Webb,' she thought.

316
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,920
'Well, I went for a walk on the beach 
yesterday afternoon,' replied Johnson.

317
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,520
'Yesterday afternoon?' Webb made it a question.

318
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
'Yes,' replied Johnson.

319
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,000
'You didn't go out again in the evening? 
After ten thirty perhaps?' asked Webb.

320
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:08,000
'No,' answered Johnson, her voice not as strong 
as before. 'I've told you. I went up to my room.'

321
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,320
Webb said nothing. He just looked at Johnson.

322
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,120
Shepherd could see Johnson's face 
beginning to go a little red.  

323
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,120
Maybe there was something she 
didn't want the police to know.

324
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,280
Johnson moved uncomfortably on her chair again.  

325
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,680
'I've told you,' she said 
again. 'I went up to my room.'

326
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Webb looked at Shepherd.

327
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,440
'OK, Ms Johnson,'  

328
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,080
said Shepherd. 'You can go. We'll want to talk 
to you again, so don't leave the hotel. OK?'

329
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,360
'Right,' said Johnson quietly, 
and she left the room, head down.

330
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,640
Shepherd and Webb looked at each other.

331
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,840
'She wasn't very happy about 
something, was she?' said Shepherd.

332
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,880
'There's something she's not telling us,'  

333
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,560
answered Webb. 'Or maybe she 
just didn't like my questions.'

334
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,480
Shepherd stood up.

335
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,320
'I need some air,' she said, taking 
her bag off the back of the chair.  

336
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,000
'And I've got a call to make. Go and 
see if there's any news about our Mr X  

337
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,920
or from the officers in the rooms. I'll 
be outside the front of the hotel.'

338
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
***

339
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,600
Fifteen minutes later Shepherd was standing 
outside the front doors of the hotel.  

340
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,520
Her phone was in her hand.

341
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,240
Webb came out of the hotel at a fast 
walk. He had a piece of paper in his hand.

342
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,200
'Two things, Shep,' he said.

343
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,120
Shepherd closed her phone. 'Well?' she asked.

344
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,880
'We know who Mr X is,' said Webb, 
looking pleased with himself. 'And  

345
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,200
one of the receptionists agrees with Johnson 
that Engel left the hotel at ten thirty.  

346
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:05,840
But she also saw Chowdury leave the 
hotel at about ten forty-five.'
 
 
 

347
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,000
CHAPTER FOUR

348
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,080
How well is MMI doing?

349
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,320
Shepherd waited for Webb 
to say more, but he didn't.  

350
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,520
'He probably wants me to say, 
"Well done,"' she thought.

351
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,600
'Come on. Don't just stand 
there. Tell me,' she said.

352
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Webb looked uncomfortable. His face went a little 
red. He looked at the piece of paper in his hand.

353
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,640
'Well... erm... the man's called Darren 
Fleming. We talked to some of the people  

354
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,840
who work in the bar. He comes into the 
hotel for a drink from time to time.  

355
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,400
He lives in Hythe somewhere. 
We're trying to find him now.'

356
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,080
'Right,' said Shepherd. 'When you do, 
bring him here. What about Chowdury?'

357
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,000
Webb looked at the paper in his hand again.

358
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:15,840
'Do you always write things down?' asked 
Shepherd. 'Do you have problems remembering?'

359
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,600
'No, Shep,' said Webb, smiling a little, 
but still looking rather uncomfortable. He  

360
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,880
waved the paper at her. 'Someone gave me this. 
Detective Constable Fox I think his name is.'

361
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,960
'All right, all right,' said Shepherd. 
She preferred not to think about DC  

362
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,000
Fox. Fox loved writing everything down, 
putting everything in the right place,  

363
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,520
doing everything just right. Not 
Shepherd's sort of person at all.

364
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,840
'I know he's a lot older than you,' said Shepherd. 
'But don't take too many lessons from Fox.'

365
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
'I'll try not to,' replied Webb.

366
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,400
For a moment Webb thought he saw the start of a 
smile on Shepherd's face, but then it was gone.

367
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,680
'The receptionist remembered Chowdury leaving 
the hotel at about ten forty-five last night,'  

368
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
said Webb. 'He was dressed in running clothes.'

369
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,760
Shepherd thought for a moment. 
'OK,' she said. 'Get Ajit Chowdury.  

370
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
We'll have a talk with him next.'

371
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,400
She put her phone away in her bag.  

372
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,360
'I've just been on the phone to a friend of 
mine in London,' she told Webb. 'She told me  

373
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,840
some interesting things about MMI. I hope the 
company accountant has some good answers.'

374
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
***

375
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,160
Twenty minutes later Chowdury was sitting in 
the Wells room in front of Shepherd and Webb.  

376
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,720
It was ten thirty. Chowdury was a tall 
good-looking man in his early thirties.  

377
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:17,680
He had on a dark brown suit, cream shirt and 
light brown tie. His fingers were playing  

378
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,680
with the front of his jacket; his eyes were 
looking from Shepherd to Webb and back again.

379
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,080
'Softly, softly,' thought Shepherd.  

380
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,640
'Don't make him uncomfortable, or he won't 
say anything. Start with some easy questions.'

381
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,240
'Tell us about your job, Mr Chowdury,' she began.

382
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,240
Chowdury sat back in the chair and stopped playing 
with his jacket. 'I'm the company accountant.  

383
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I look after the money,' he 
answered, smiling a little.

384
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,160
'So I understand,' said Shepherd. 'And is 
it a good job? A good company to work for?'

385
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
'Well, yes. I think so,' he replied.

386
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,960
'Do you all like each other? I mean, do 
you work well together?' asked Shepherd.

387
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,640
'We aren't all great friends,' he 
replied. 'But we work well together. Yes.'

388
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,920
'Claudia Engel too?' asked Shepherd quietly.

389
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,160
Chowdury looked away to one side for a moment  

390
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,880
then back at Shepherd. 'She could 
be rather difficult,' he said.

391
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,200
'Tell me about it,' said Shepherd. 'Believe me, 
I know all about working with difficult people.'

392
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,680
Chowdury gave her a small smile. 'She was a hard 
woman,' he began. 'She knew what she wanted.  

393
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,160
She knew how to get it. And she didn't 
allow anybody to get in her way.'

394
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,080
'I understand you know quite a bit about 
music,' said Shepherd, 'as well as money.'

395
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:14,160
'Yes,' replied Chowdury. 'But Claudia never 
listened to what I thought. I spend a lot of  

396
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,680
time in clubs. I've seen a lot of good 
new bands. But she always knew best.'

397
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,320
There was something strange in Chowdury's 
voice that made Shepherd ask her next question.

398
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
'Were you lovers?' she asked.

399
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Webb turned quickly to look at Shepherd.

400
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,840
There was fire in Chowdury's eyes. 
'It's nothing to do with...' he started.

401
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,400
'It's murder,' said Shepherd, her voice 
hard, before Chowdury could finish.

402
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:58,640
Chowdury's head went down. Then he looked at 
her again. 'We slept together once,' he said,  

403
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,480
an angry look in his eyes. And then she 
said that was it. It was over. Finished.'

404
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,320
'And that made you angry,' said 
Shepherd. It wasn't a question.

405
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,280
'It still does,' said Chowdury. 'But not 
enough to kill her. It hurt me at the time,  

406
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,840
but it was just one night. And she didn't tell 
everyone about it. No-one in the office knew.'

407
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,960
'Did she like working for McNab?' asked Shepherd.

408
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,480
'When she started, she was 
quite happy,' began Chowdury,  

409
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,840
'but things have been difficult 
for the last month or two.'

410
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,280
'In what way?' asked Shepherd.

411
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:50,720
'Well, at first she and James always agreed on 
everything,' replied Chowdury. 'But, like I said,  

412
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:58,400
for the last month or two they haven't. I was 
walking past McNab's room yesterday afternoon -  

413
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,920
we're all on the second floor - and I could hear 
her in there. They were shouting at each other.'

414
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
'What about?' asked Shepherd.

415
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,400
'I didn't hear much,' answered Chowdury. 
'One of the hotel cleaners was near,  

416
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,320
so I couldn't stop and listen. But 
I did hear her say, "You need me,  

417
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:28,160
James. Give me what I want, or your company 
is finished." That was all I heard.'

418
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,040
'What do you think she wanted?' asked Shepherd. 
'Money.' Chowdury didn't stop to think for a  

419
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,200
moment. 'Ah!' said Shepherd, thinking about the 
telephone conversation with her friend in London.

420
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:52,480
And how is the company doing?' asked Shepherd. 
'I've heard it's not doing too well.'

421
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,680
'Who told you that?' asked Chowdury quickly.

422
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,800
'How is the company doing?' Shepherd 
asked again, her voice a little harder.

423
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,680
Chowdury thought for a moment.

424
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:15,920
'Not great,' he said. 'I mean, I'm the accountant. 
I can make the numbers look good on paper,  

425
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:25,280
but actually they're not great. Some of our big 
stars aren't as good as they were. Sales fell last  

426
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,640
year and will fall again this year. There are two 
new bands out there that we think are very good.  

427
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,160
Claudia was trying to get them to work with 
MMI, but they're still thinking about it.'

428
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:49,280
'I see,' said Shepherd. She said 
nothing for a moment. Then Webb spoke.  

429
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,720
'What about last night?' he asked. 'Where 
were you going at about a quarter to eleven?'

430
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,120
'For a run. Why?' asked Chowdury.

431
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,800
'Which way did you go?' asked Webb.

432
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,280
'Out of the hotel and right,' replied Chowdury. 'I 
ran along by the beach for four or five kilometres  

433
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,440
and then came back. I got 
back about eleven thirty.'

434
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,560
Shepherd thought, 'Claudia Engel's body was a 
few hundred metres to the left of the hotel.  

435
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,240
The other way.'

436
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,040
At that moment DC Fox's head came round the 
door. 'Shep,' he said. 'You'll want to see this.'

437
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,840
Shepherd left the room for a 
moment and then came back in.  

438
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,440
Fox stood by the door. In Shepherd's hand 
was a golf club in a long plastic bag.

439
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,160
'One of my officers found this in your room,' 
she said to Chowdury. 'Is it yours?'
 
 
 

440
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,120
CHAPTER FIVE

441
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,320
More about Claudia Engel

442
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,440
Chowdury opened his mouth and closed it again.

443
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,080
'Yes, it's mine,' he said.

444
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,000
'You only have one golf club?' asked Shepherd.

445
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,120
'It's a new one,' answered Chowdury. 
'I bought it the day before yesterday.  

446
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,360
My other clubs are in the golf 
bag in the back of my car.'

447
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,120
'We'll need to look at those too,' said 
Shepherd, putting out a hand. 'Keys, please.'

448
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,800
Chowdury gave his car keys to Shepherd. She 
passed his keys and the golf club to Fox.

449
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,240
'You know what to do,' she said.

450
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
'Yes, Shep,' Fox replied.

451
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,920
Shepherd looked at her watch, then at Chowdury.

452
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,680
'You can go,' she said, 'but don't leave the 
hotel. I'll have more questions for you later.'

453
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,400
Chowdury left the room.

454
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,480
Webb looked at Shepherd. 'Your phone call,' he 
said. 'That's how you know business is not good.'

455
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,600
'Yes,' replied Shepherd. 'A friend in 
the music business. It's a small world.'

456
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,080
'And how did you know that Chowdury and 
Engel were lovers at one time?' Webb asked.

457
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,840
'I didn't,' said Shepherd.  

458
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,320
'But there was something in his voice that 
made me think it was a good question to ask.'

459
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,080
Shepherd took a pen from the 
table and started playing with it.  

460
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,760
'And DC Fox told me that Darren Fleming is here.

461
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:01,280
Get him in here next. Ask for some sandwiches 
for later too. And more coffee, if you want it.'

462
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,240
Shepherd looked at her watch. It was 
twelve o'clock. Time for a real drink.

463
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,600
And you can get me a glass of 
red wine from the bar,' she said.

464
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,600
Webb looked at Shepherd as he stood up.  

465
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,920
She was certainly different from 
other police inspectors he knew.

466
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,520
But he just said, 'Right, Shep.'

467
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,800
And this time you ask the questions,' 
said Shepherd. Webb smiled.

468
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,400
'Thanks.'

469
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:42,200
'Don't thank me yet,' replied Shepherd, not 
smiling back. 'I'll be in here with you.'

470
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,200
***

471
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,360
A few minutes later, they were back in the Wells 
room. Shepherd and Webb were in their usual seats;  

472
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,760
Darren Fleming was opposite them.  

473
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,240
Fleming was in his late twenties, 
wearing jeans and a brown shirt.

474
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,240
'Why am I here?' he asked Shepherd.

475
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,080
'You were in the hotel last night,' said Webb.

476
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,200
'Yes, but only for a short 
time,' answered Fleming.

477
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
'Why was that?' asked Webb.

478
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,920
'Because I saw someone...' 
began Fleming. He stopped.  

479
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,200
He looked at Shepherd, then back at 
Webb. 'What's all this about?' he asked.

480
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,840
'We found a body on the beach early this morning,' 
said Webb. 'Claudia Engel's body. She was dead.'

481
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
'Murdered?' asked Fleming.

482
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,520
'Yes,' said Webb.

483
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,440
'Poor Claudia,' said Fleming. 'Poor Claudia.'

484
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
'You knew her?' asked Webb.

485
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:02,560
'Yes. We were students together in London,' said 
Fleming. 'We lived in the same house. For a year.  

486
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,840
Not happy times.'

487
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,960
'Why not?' asked Webb.

488
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,840
'It was an unhappy house - mainly 
because of Claudia,' said Fleming.  

489
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,120
He was quiet for a moment, 
remembering. Then he spoke again.

490
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,920
'We were studying the same thing - 
business - so I saw a lot of her.  

491
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,760
She wasn't a nice person. When she said 
something, you never knew if it was true.  

492
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:44,240
She sometimes told stories about people - other 
students - and I knew the stories were untrue.  

493
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:53,520
She could be really nice if she wanted 
something - help with her studies, someone to  

494
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:02,160
cook her a meal - but you had to do what she 
wanted. If you didn't, she told everyone else  

495
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,000
how terrible you were. By the end of the 
year I just wanted to get out of that house.  

496
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
There were five of us living there 
and everyone felt the same way.'

497
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,920
'Did she know how you felt?' asked Webb.

498
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:26,560
'Oh yes,' said Fleming. 'She certainly knew how I 
felt. One time she wanted to borrow a piece of my  

499
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:34,960
work. She wanted to use it in something she was 
doing. I wasn't having any of it. I told her no.  

500
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,240
She could do her own work. She said some bad 
things about me to other people and I found out.'

501
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,600
'And?' asked Webb.

502
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,160
'I told her what I thought of her.  

503
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,000
In front of most of the students from 
one of our classes. I was so angry.'

504
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:01,680
Then Fleming smiled. 'But that 
was ten years ago,' he said.

505
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,120
And are you still angry?' asked Webb.  

506
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,440
'Because you just turned round and 
walked out of the hotel last night.'

507
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,760
Fleming sat up in his chair and looked at Webb.

508
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:21,840
'No,' he said. 'I'm not angry now. 
If anything, I feel sorry for her.  

509
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:30,160
She had no real friends. But yes, I walked out 
last night. The past is sometimes a dangerous  

510
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:38,720
place. I didn't want to go there. I went back 
home. I was unlucky enough to see Claudia Engel  

511
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:46,800
for about five seconds yesterday evening. That's 
all. I didn't see her again. Now can I go?'

512
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,280
'You didn't meet her later 
that evening?' asked Webb.

513
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,560
'Certainly not,' replied Fleming.

514
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,960
'Was anyone with you when you 
were at home?' asked Webb.

515
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
'No,' replied Fleming.

516
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,360
'Did you phone anyone? Email anyone?' asked Webb.

517
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,440
'No,' replied Fleming.

518
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,920
Webb looked at Shepherd.

519
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,840
'Put all this in writing for one of my officers,'  

520
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Shepherd told Fleming. 'Then you 
can go. But don't leave Hythe.'

521
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
***

522
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,200
Ten minutes later Shepherd and Webb were 
standing outside the front doors of the hotel.  

523
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,320
Webb had a sandwich, Shepherd her glass of wine.

524
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,880
'What a nice young woman Claudia 
Engel was!' said Shepherd.

525
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,640
Webb smiled.

526
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,880
Shepherd drank some wine.

527
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,200
'Good questioning in there,' she said.

528
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,840
'Thank you,' said Webb.

529
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,480
'Don't get too pleased with yourself,' said 
Shepherd. 'We've still got a long way to go.'

530
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,600
Webb smiled to himself. 'By the way, Shep,' he 
began, 'there's a door at the back of the hotel  

531
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,160
where you could go out without anyone seeing you.'

532
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,840
'Right,' said Shepherd. 'That's good to know.'

533
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,560
Shepherd thought for a moment.

534
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:29,280
'Let's go and have a look round Engel's room,' 
she said. 'I know DC Fox has been there already,  

535
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,800
but I want to see it for myself. Fox is a 
good officer, but sometimes he's too careful.  

536
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:45,840
He doesn't let his brain run free. Get the key 
from reception and meet me on the second floor.'

537
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
***

538
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,880
A few minutes later Webb met Shepherd 
outside Claudia Engel's room.

539
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,360
'Reception gave me a key, but it isn't Engel's,'  

540
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:03,520
said Webb as he opened the door. 'No-one 
can find her key and it wasn't on the body.'

541
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,240
'Oh,' said Shepherd, 'that's interesting.'

542
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,840
Claudia Engel had a large double 
room looking over the sea.

543
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,280
'I'll start in the bathroom,' said 
Shepherd. 'You look round here.'

544
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,120
'What are we looking for?' asked Webb.

545
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,840
'We'll know it when we see it,' answered Shepherd.

546
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,720
Shepherd took a quick look round the bathroom. 
There wasn't much to see - Engel was only staying  

547
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,920
two or three nights. Shepherd saw nothing 
unusual. She went back into the bedroom.

548
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,920
Webb was looking through Engel's clothes.

549
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,720
'Anything?' asked Shepherd.

550
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,280
'No, Shep,' answered Webb.

551
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,840
Shepherd looked round the room.  

552
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,840
There was a book, a clock and a music magazine 
on the table next to the bed. Some keys on the  

553
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:07,360
table too - house and car, thought Shepherd. A 
raincoat behind the door - nothing in the pockets.

554
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,920
She looked round the room again. Something 
was wrong. She didn't know what. She could  

555
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,520
feel her morning headache coming 
back, just when she didn't need it.

556
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:28,720
Just then she heard Webb's phone. He answered 
it. Shepherd looked out of the window at the sea,  

557
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,800
not listening to Webb's conversation, but 
thinking about the room. What was wrong with it?  

558
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:41,040
And where was Engel's key? She 
heard Webb finish his conversation.

559
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,440
Shepherd looked at Webb.

560
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,720
'Well?' she asked.

561
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,080
'Nothing important,' replied Webb.

562
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,440
Shepherd looked round the room a third time.

563
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,360
'You know I said, "We'll know 
it when we see it,"' she began.

564
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,720
'Yes?' said Webb questioningly.

565
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,120
'Well, we'll also know it if we 
don't see it,' said Shepherd.

566
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,560
'What do you mean?' asked Webb. Then he smiled.  

567
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,360
'Oh, I see. So what have we not 
found - other than the key?'

568
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,480
'The thing that business people all 
around the world carry with them  

569
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,880
at all times,' said Shepherd.

570
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,840
'A laptop computer,' replied Webb.

571
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,760
'Let's start again,' said Shepherd.

572
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,080
Five minutes later they were finished. 
There wasn't a laptop in the room - not  

573
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,520
in the cupboard, not under the 
bed, not in the bed, nowhere.

574
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:57,760
'We need to find it,' said Shepherd. 'First, find 
out if she had one here - I can't believe she  

575
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,360
didn't - and find out what sort it was. Then put 
all our officers on it. Look all around the hotel.  

576
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,240
Have another look in the rooms of those other 
three jokers - McNab, Johnson and Chowdury. Send  

577
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,760
someone round to Fleming's house. And get as many 
people as you can to go along the beach again.'

578
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,640
'Right, Shep,' said Webb.

579
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:29,840
'After that, you'll find me 
in the bar,' said Shepherd.
 
 
 

580
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,720
CHAPTER SIX

581
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,960
Unanswered questions

582
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,120
At two o'clock Webb found 
Shepherd, sitting at the bar,  

583
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,640
talking to the barman. She looked round 
as Webb came in. The barman moved away.

584
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,000
'Engel had a laptop,' said 
Webb, sitting next to her.  

585
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,920
'We know what sort it is. I've got 
all our officers looking for it.'

586
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:06,080
'Good,' said Shepherd. 'Now, there are a 
number of things I want to know. For a start,  

587
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:13,680
what's on Engel's laptop? Second, why did 
Engel think that MMI needed her so much?  

588
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,000
Remember what Chowdury heard her say - "Give 
me what I want, or your company is finished."  

589
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,240
What could she do to bring an end to the 
company? Next, what's Harriet Johnson  

590
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:37,200
not telling us? She was very uncomfortable 
about some of our questions. And last,  

591
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,080
why do McNab and Johnson say 
that the business is doing well  

592
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:49,040
when Chowdury says it isn't, and my friend 
in the music business knows it isn't?'

593
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:56,080
Shepherd waved at the barman. 'I'll have 
a glass of red wine, please,' she said.

594
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,200
Webb gave Shepherd a funny look. Shepherd saw it.

595
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,680
'When you've done this job 
as long as I have, Sergeant,'  

596
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,640
she said, 'you'll find you need a 
glass of red wine now and then.'

597
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,200
'While you're working?' asked Webb.

598
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
'It helps me think,' replied Shepherd.

599
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,920
A grey-haired man came into the room 
and stood at the far end of the bar.  

600
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,720
He put his keys on top of the bar and 
waited for the barman to come over.

601
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,840
DC Fox came to the door and waved.

602
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:43,120
'See what he wants,' said Shepherd and stayed 
sitting. Webb left the room to talk to Fox.

603
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,400
Shepherd sat and thought. She 
looked at the grey-haired man,  

604
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,480
now sitting at the other end of the bar. Then 
she looked at his keys. There were four or five.  

605
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:06,560
And something else. What was it? Oh 
yes! A memory stick for a computer.

606
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:16,400
Webb came back. 'They've found Engel's room key 
and her laptop,' he told Shepherd. 'They were  

607
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,520
hidden in an old garage at the back of the hotel. 
But I don't think we're going to get anything  

608
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,000
from the laptop. Someone's broken it up. It was in 
pieces. And I'm not sure we've got all the bits.'

609
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,840
Shepherd put her head in her hands for a moment.  

610
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Then she looked up and saw the memory stick 
on the bar again. It gave her an idea.

611
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,080
'Wait a minute,' she said. She looked out 
of the window, and thought for a minute.  

612
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,840
Then she looked at Webb. 'I've had an idea.'  

613
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,560
She thought for a few moments more, a 
finger to her mouth, her eyes half closed.

614
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:05,280
'OK. Let's do it,' said 
Shepherd. 'I want to see McNab,  

615
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:12,560
Johnson and Chowdury in the Wells room. 
Fleming too. Send a car for him. Let's  

616
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,800
say we'll meet in forty-five minutes. 
I've got a few things to do first.'

617
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,680
'Right, Shep,' said Webb and left the room, 
asking himself what her idea could be.

618
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,720
Shepherd sat for a few minutes, 
thinking through her idea.  

619
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,120
Then she left too, taking her wine with her.

620
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
***

621
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,800
It was four thirty by the time Webb got everyone 
together in the Wells room. Shepherd walked in  

622
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:52,000
and looked round. Webb was already sitting in 
his usual place. Across the table sat Chowdury,  

623
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:59,840
McNab and Johnson. Fleming sat a little away from 
the table. DC Fox stood just inside the door.

624
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:08,240
'Good afternoon, everyone,' said Shepherd. 'This 
is Mr Fleming.' She waved a hand at Fleming. 'You  

625
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:15,680
will know him from last night. He knew Ms Engel 
some years ago.' She looked at Fleming. 'Over here  

626
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:21,920
are Mr McNab, Ms Engel's boss, and Mr Chowdury 
and Ms Johnson, who worked with Ms Engel.'

627
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,280
Shepherd walked round the table. 
There was an envelope in her hand,  

628
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,400
which she put on the table in front 
of her chair. Then she sat down.

629
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,920
'I've asked you all here together because one 
of you killed Claudia Engel,' said Shepherd.

630
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:46,400
Everyone started speaking at the 
same time. Shepherd put up a hand.

631
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:52,320
'Stop talking,' she said. 
Everyone stopped speaking.

632
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,960
'I don't know how many friends Ms Engel had,'  

633
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,320
began Shepherd, 'but certainly 
no-one here was friends with her.'

634
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,840
McNab started to say something, 
but Shepherd put up a hand again.

635
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,800
'Later, Mr McNab,' she said. 
'You can say something later.'

636
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:21,680
'Not one of you liked her. Each of you could be 
the killer. Mr Fleming, you say you were at home,  

637
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:30,000
but we don't know if that's true. Mr Chowdury, you 
say you turned right for a run along the beach,  

638
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,840
but what if you went the other way? 
Ms Johnson, you say you sat in the  

639
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:42,720
lounge and then went to your room, but 
what if you went outside? And Mr McNab,  

640
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,160
you say you watched TV in your room and 
then went to bed, but how do we know that?'

641
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,520
Shepherd saw Johnson look at 
McNab and move on her seat.

642
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,960
'Now look here-' said McNab.

643
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:05,840
'Shut up,' said Shepherd. She looked at the 
four faces in front of her, then at McNab.

644
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,920
'MMI isn't doing well, is it?' she 
said. And don't try and tell me it is.'

645
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,360
McNab gave Chowdury an angry look.

646
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,960
'I didn't tell her,' said 
Chowdury. 'She knew already.'

647
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,760
McNab looked back at Shepherd.

648
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,920
'How...' he began.

649
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,600
'Is it?' said Shepherd.

650
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,480
'No, it isn't,' said McNab. 'But 
there are these two new bands.'

651
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:42,400
'Ah, yes!' said Shepherd. 'The 
two bands. Are they real?'

652
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,960
'Yes,' said McNab and Chowdury at the same time.

653
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:55,920
'Good,' said Shepherd. 'Now have I 
got this right? If these two bands  

654
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:02,320
come to MMI, your company is OK. But if 
these two bands go to a different company,  

655
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,320
then that's the beginning of 
the end for MMI. Is that right?'

656
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,320
'Well...' began McNab.

657
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,320
'Yes,' said Chowdury. 'He'll try 
and tell you something different,  

658
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:20,800
but MMI is just a small company. 
It can't get much smaller.'

659
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:29,680
'So, if the bands don't come to you, that's 
the end of MMI. And you all lose your jobs,'  

660
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,400
said Shepherd. And the person who was 
bringing the bands to MMI was Claudia Engel.'

661
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,600
'What are you saying?' asked McNab.

662
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,640
'I'm not saying anything,' said Shepherd. 'I'm 
just making sure we all understand where we are.'

663
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,920
She looked round the room at everyone again.

664
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:58,160
'The next thing I want to talk about is Ms 
Engel's laptop,' she said. 'We've just found it.  

665
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,800
In pieces. Hidden in an old 
garage at the back of the hotel.'

666
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,920
At that moment the door opened. A 
police officer said something to DC Fox.  

667
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,400
Fox came over to Shepherd and spoke 
to her quietly. She looked at Johnson.

668
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,800
'Just what I need,' thought Shepherd. 
A way to make Harriet Johnson talk.

669
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,960
'Ms Johnson, one of the cleaners saw 
you leaving the hotel this morning  

670
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:39,120
at six thirty. You were carrying a laptop bag. 
Perhaps you could tell us what you were doing.'
 
 
 

671
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,000
CHAPTER SEVEN

672
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,440
Who killed Claudia Engel?

673
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,000
Everyone in the room looked at Harriet Johnson.

674
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,720
'I...' began Johnson. Her face turned dark 
red. She stopped and then started again.

675
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:11,840
'I was taking my laptop out to my car,' she said. 
'This was our last day here. I knew I didn't need  

676
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:19,120
my laptop again, so I went to put it in my car. 
But it was my laptop. You have to believe me.'

677
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,840
'Excuse me, Shep.' It was Fox who spoke.  

678
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,520
'When we asked to see everyone's 
laptop, Ms Johnson's was in her room.'

679
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,920
'Yes, yes,' said Johnson. 'I know. I brought 
it back. When I knew we had to stay longer  

680
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:45,920
because of... because of Claudia, I went 
and got it. I thought I could do some work.'

681
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:53,840
Shepherd looked at Johnson for a few 
seconds. 'Tell me, Ms Johnson,' she began,  

682
01:06:53,840 --> 01:07:01,840
her voice hard, 'tell me everything that 
you did after ten thirty last night.'

683
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,640
For a moment Johnson didn't speak. 
She looked at McNab, then at Shepherd.

684
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,640
'And don't tell me you just went 
to your room and went to bed,'  

685
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,800
said Shepherd, 'because I won't believe you.'

686
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,320
Johnson looked down at her hands for 
a moment and then up at Shepherd.

687
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:33,440
'I went to James's room,' she said. 
'I wanted to ask him something about a  

688
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,880
problem we're having with sales in North 
America. I needed to send an email to  

689
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,120
the States before I went to bed. But James 
wasn't there. He didn't come to the door.'

690
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:52,720
Johnson looked at McNab. 
'I'm sorry, James,' she said.  

691
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:04,640
'Well, Mr McNab?' asked Shepherd. 'Where 
were you?' Now McNab's face went red.

692
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:13,520
'I was probably in the shower,' he answered. 'I 
told you I had a shower before I went to bed.'

693
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:24,080
'You didn't go out?' said Shepherd. 'You 
didn't use the door at the back of the hotel?'

694
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,840
'No,' he replied.

695
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Shepherd looked round the room at everyone.  

696
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,200
Her fingers started playing with the 
envelope on the table in front of her.  

697
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:42,080
The envelope was open and there was writing on 
the front of it. She looked back at James McNab.

698
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:50,160
'Maybe what you're saying is true; maybe 
it's not,' said Shepherd. 'I don't know yet,  

699
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:59,280
but one way or another I'm going to find out.' She 
looked round the room again. 'And I do know this.  

700
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:08,480
Claudia Engel's laptop is important. Her killer 
knows it's important too. There's something on her  

701
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:16,240
computer - an email, a letter, something like that 
- something that will tell me who the killer is.'

702
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,920
Nobody spoke. The room was very quiet.

703
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,720
'I also think Ms Engel knew she 
was in danger,' said Shepherd,  

704
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:35,440
looking in turn at each of the people sitting 
in front of her. She turned the envelope over  

705
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:41,520
so that everyone could see the writing on the 
front. There were two words: 'Claudia Engel'.

706
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,480
'She left this at the hotel reception 
yesterday afternoon,' said Shepherd,  

707
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:56,320
opening the envelope and turning it over. A memory 
stick fell out onto the table in front of her.  

708
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:03,280
'Do you know what's on this?' she asked 
and then answered the question herself.  

709
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:11,200
'Everything that was on her computer. Claudia 
put everything important from her laptop onto  

710
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:18,480
this memory stick and gave it to reception 
to keep safe. It could take me some time to  

711
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:25,760
find what I'm looking for - the important 
email or letter - but I will find it.'

712
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,120
Again nobody spoke. Shepherd 
watched everyone carefully.  

713
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:40,720
Johnson's hand went to her mouth. Chowdury 
looked like he had a lot of questions to ask.  

714
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:47,440
Fleming was sitting back in his chair looking 
from Shepherd to the MMI people and back again.  

715
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,080
But it was McNab who looked most uncomfortable.

716
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,160
Shepherd watched him carefully.

717
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:04,880
At that moment the door opened. A police 
officer gave DC Fox a piece of paper. Fox  

718
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,880
passed the paper to Shepherd, who 
looked at it, then smiled at Webb.  

719
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,480
Webb looked at her questioningly. 
Shepherd looked round the room again.

720
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:21,440
'You'll be interested to know that one of 
my officers has had a look at the door at  

721
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,960
the back of the hotel,' she said. 'He's found 
quite a few fingerprints on it from a number  

722
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:34,160
of different hands. We've also found the 
piece of wood used to hit Ms Engel, and  

723
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:40,320
we're looking for fingerprints on that. But then, 
of course, I'm sure the murderer wore gloves...'

724
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:48,280
She stopped speaking for a moment and 
watched McNab. All the colour left his face.

725
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:54,080
'... or maybe not,' finished Shepherd.

726
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,080
McNab's mouth opened and closed. He started 
to speak, then stopped, then started again.

727
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,800
'Yes, Mr McNab?' said Shepherd quietly.

728
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,080
'I had to,' he said. 'I just 
had to. She wanted too much.  

729
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,920
She always wanted too much. She earned 
good money, but she wanted double.'

730
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,920
And you didn't want to pay that,' said Shepherd.

731
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:28,320
'I couldn't,' said McNab. 'I couldn't, but she 
didn't believe me. "Double, or else..." she said.'

732
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,040
'Or else what?' asked Shepherd.

733
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:38,640
'She said, "I'll start a new company. The 
two new bands will come to me; in time  

734
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:45,040
most of your old bands will come to me too. 
You're finished, James." That's what she said.'  

735
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:53,760
McNab's voice became stronger. 'I started 
MMI fifteen years ago. I built the company.  

736
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,800
I couldn't let her end it 
all. Not someone like her.'

737
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,840
'So you invited her for a walk 
on the beach,' said Shepherd.

738
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:12,800
'Yes,' said McNab. 'I told her I was sure we 
could agree something. I went out through the  

739
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:18,800
back door so no-one saw us together. Then 
I met her outside the front of the hotel.'

740
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,200
He pushed his fingers through his hair and spoke 
again. 'I told her I wanted to talk about it.  

741
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,840
I tried one last time. I said I'd give her fifty 
percent more money. "Double or nothing," she  

742
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:45,280
said. She laughed at me. That made me so angry. 
She turned her back on me to look out to sea.  

743
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:54,720
There was a piece of wood on the beach. I hit her 
with it. Just once. She fell. It was all over.'

744
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:02,000
'Then you took her room key, went to her 
room and took the laptop,' said Shepherd.

745
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,640
'Yes,' said McNab. 'I went  

746
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,640
in and out through the back door again. I took the 
laptop out to that old garage behind the hotel.  

747
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,200
I broke it up into pieces with a large 
stone and hid it.' His head went down.

748
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:27,840
'Fox,' said Shepherd. 'Get another officer 
and take Mr McNab to the police station.'  

749
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,640
She looked at the other people in 
the room. 'OK. You all need to put  

750
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:41,840
in writing what you've done over the last 
twenty-four hours. Then you're free to go.'

751
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,240
Fifteen minutes later Shepherd 
and Webb were sitting in the bar.  

752
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,960
There was a half-empty glass of red wine in front 
of Shepherd, and an orange juice in front of Webb.  

753
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,480
Shepherd's fingers were 
playing with the memory stick.

754
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,640
'When did I say I wanted someone to 
look at the back door?' she asked.

755
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,200
'You didn't,' replied Webb.

756
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,600
'Good for you,' said Shepherd. 'I like 
having a sergeant who uses his brain.'

757
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,240
'Well, I knew the killer didn't have 
much time to decide how to kill Engel,'  

758
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,680
said Webb. 'I just thought it would be a good 
idea to look for fingerprints on the back door.  

759
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:28,640
I mean, nobody has gloves with 
them in September anyway.'

760
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,800
Shepherd smiled.

761
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,840
'It's lucky for us too that Claudia Engel 
put everything onto the memory stick and  

762
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,280
left it at reception,' said Webb. 'And 
that you thought to ask them about it.'

763
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,920
'It's not lucky at all,' said Shepherd.

764
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,960
'What do you mean?' asked Webb.

765
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,440
'It's not her memory stick,' said Shepherd.  

766
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:57,520
'I borrowed it from reception 
just before I talked to that lot.'

767
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,840
'But the writing on the envelope...' said Webb.

768
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,280
'Engel wrote her name at reception 
when she arrived two days ago.  

769
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,520
I thought I did quite a good 
job of making it look the same.'

770
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,280
'But...' began Webb. 'You mean...'

771
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:22,880
'That's right,' she said. 'McNab believed 
we knew everything, but actually we didn't.'

772
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,000
Shepherd took a drink of her wine.

773
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,080
'So what was on her computer?' 
asked Webb. 'What was so important?'

774
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,480
'I have no idea,' said Shepherd and laughed.  

775
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,120
'If we're lucky, McNab will 
tell us. But if he doesn't,  

776
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:49,120
that's OK too. He's told us that he killed Engel. 
That's the important thing. And from the look on  

777
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:55,040
his face he didn't bring any gloves with him. 
So we'll probably have his fingerprints too.'

778
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,160
Webb drank some of his orange 
juice and looked at Shepherd.  

779
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,480
She really wasn't the usual 
kind of police inspector.

780
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,680
'We found the murderer...' Shepherd looked at her  

781
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:15,840
watch '... in under twelve hours. I call 
that a good day's work. Well done us!'

782
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,320
Webb smiled.

783
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,520
'Right,' said Shepherd, standing 
up and finishing her drink.  

784
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:29,840
'I'm going to give this memory stick back to 
reception. Mine's another glass of red wine.'
 
 
 
 

785
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,374
- THE END -
