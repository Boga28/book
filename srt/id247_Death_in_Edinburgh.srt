00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,590
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,509
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,219
Angus groaned and hugged the pillow closer
to him.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,990
Maybe if he pretended to be asleep the noise
would just go away.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,390
Buzz, buzz.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,020
It stopped.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,710
But there was someone hammering on the wall.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,260
Or, no, it seemed to be closer.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,640
It seemed to be coming from inside his head.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,219
Buzz, buzz, buzz.

11
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:39,680
Angus groaned again, stretched out his arm
and pulled the ringing phone to his ear.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,590
"Good morning, Angus," he heard Ross's voice
say, "Or should that be 'Good afternoon'?

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,750
How're you feeling?"

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,540
"I'm dying.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,649
Leave me alone," was Angus's mumbled reply.

16
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,390
"Nah, that wouldn't be much fun."

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,070
Ross sounded like he was enjoying himself.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,019
Angus turned over, wincing as the sunlight
hit his eyes.

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,890
"What are you doing up so early?

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,040
Why are you so cheerful?"

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,250
"I'm not cheerful, it's just Schadenfreude.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,700
And it's not early, it's 1 o'clock and I've
been up since eight.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,049
Some of us have real jobs,
you know."

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,280
"Uh-huh," was Angus's response.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,110
"So, you had a good time last night, then?

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,860
Susie and you seemed to be having a good chat
when I left."

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,200
"Oh?"

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,530
The mention of Susie's name had finally woken
Angus up.

29
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,110
"In fact, I was wondering if you know where
she is?

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,479
A body's been found and everyone has to get
to Arthur's Seat now."

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,869
Angus pulled himself into a sitting position,
and rubbed his eyes while he tried to understand

32
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,670
the implications of Ross's question.

33
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,789
It
took a moment but then he felt himself blush

34
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,990
to his ears.

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,250
"No, no!

36
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,030
I've no idea where she is," he protested.

37
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,490
"Wh-why?

38
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,149
Can you not get hold of her?"

39
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,580
"No, she's not answering her phone, so I put
two and two together..."

40
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,230
Ross still sounded amused, but became serious,
"But she really needs

41
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,170
to come to work, the boss is not pleased,
so if you hear from her..."

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,450
"Of course.

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,629
You said Arthur's Seat and a body?"

44
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:28,860
"That's right.

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,099
I'm heading over there now."

46
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,209
"OK, well I hope you find Susie soon."

47
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,379
"Right you are, bye."

48
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,130
Angus sat a moment, the phone quiet in his
hand.

49
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:49,500
A body on Arthur's Seat, now that didn't happen
every day of the week, maybe he'd walk up

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,130
there himself, see what was going on.

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,330
He might see Susie... and some fresh air would
help his sore head.

52
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,870
But first things first: he needed a cup of
tea.

53
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,170
Thirty-five minutes later, Angus stumbled
out of the front door of the Marchmont tenement

54
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:15,239
he had lived in for a little over a year and
began to walk in the direction of Newington.

55
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,810
It was warmer than he had expected and he
was soon regretting the jacket he'd grabbed

56
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,799
on his way out.

57
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,530
He quickly forgot about that as he turned
into Holyrood Park Road and saw the police

58
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,250
vans parked at the end, sirens off but blue
lights flashing.

59
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,980
He was surprised that they were still there,
as he had taken a long time to get ready.

60
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,030
It must be very serious.

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,850
As he neared the entrance to Holyrood Park,
he could see a police-tape barrier strung

62
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,980
across the road and pavement.

63
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,280
A group of students
from the nearby university accommodation were

64
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,640
smoking and texting; a couple of joggers had
also paused and were chatting to an elderly

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,280
couple; off to the side was a young woman.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,390
She stood out with her amazing, fiery-red
hair which was blowing across her face in

67
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,390
the breeze.

68
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:17,010
It contrasted perfectly with her green dress,
and Angus was momentarily distracted by this

69
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,070
vision.

70
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,680
He quickly turned his attention, however,
to the men and women on the other side of

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,610
the plastic barrier: police officers, forensic
scientists and other miscellaneous people

72
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,040
who had a job to do at a crime scene.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,699
He caught sight of Ross standing near a van,
talking to his superior.

74
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:46,100
Looking around, he saw Susie approach them
- so Ross had managed to find her.

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,449
He watched as she greeted Ross and their
chief, who didn't look very pleased.

76
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:59,229
He gestured towards the crowd of people and
Susie started walking in their direction.

77
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,949
As he waited for her to cross the 100 yards
or so to where he and the others were standing,

78
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,350
his attention was again diverted, this time
to

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:15,360
two paramedics carrying down a covered body
and a police officer pulling at the lead of

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,009
a dog.

81
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:23,169
The animal, a Border Collie, was tugging at
its restraint and barking quite fiercely.

82
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:28,290
The uniformed officer was clearly having some
trouble keeping the dog under control.

83
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,100
"Thank you everyone, there's nothing to see
here.

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,530
Please be on your way and clear the area,
so that we can get on with our investigation."

85
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,360
Susie seemed less than happy to have this
task and stood with arms crossed as the collection

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,000
of people moved off a few more yards.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,890
Job done, she turned to Angus.

88
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,130
"Afternoon.

89
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,340
What you doing here then?"

90
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,970
The tone was neutral but there was a hint
of a smile on her face.

91
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,440
"Well, Ross woke me up and so I thought I
might as well come and have a look..."

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,500
Angus smiled and trailed to a halt.

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,050
"Um, so how are you?"

94
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,650
"Couldn't be better."

95
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,259
Angus nodded at the sarcasm and asked: "What
happened here anyway?"

96
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,410
"Now Angus, you know I can't tell you anything.

97
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,070
You'll just have to read about it in the paper.

98
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,110
Besides, I'd better be getting on.

99
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,790
See you
later."

100
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,940
"Yes, fine.

101
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,080
Take care."

102
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,710
Angus watched as Susie started to walk away.

103
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,660
Behind her he could see the struggling officer
and dog, which was still pulling at its lead.

104
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,139
Angus imagined it desperately trying to return
to its master's side, the story of Greyfriar's

105
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,500
Bobby, the dog who wouldn't leave his master's
grave, coming to mind...

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,539
And at that moment, the collie finally broke
free of the young officer and went tearing

107
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,000
off, dodging
parked cars and outstretched arms, before

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,509
vanishing into the undergrowth.

109
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,139
There were shouts and arm-waving from the
police officers but nothing more of interest

110
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,009
to see.

111
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,629
Angus turned his back on the scene, and
wondered what he should do now.

112
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:27,791
It was a lovely day and he was in no hurry
to return to his messy flat; he'd go for a

113
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,009
walk and clear the cobwebs.

114
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:36,810
Removing the too-warm jacket, he meandered
off, with only one more glance at the action

115
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:47,229
behind him, the mound of the Crags and
Arthur's Seat bathed in the soft April sunlight.

116
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,730
CHAPTER TWO

117
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,139
Edinburgh had been Angus Fleming's home for
eleven years now, but he hadn't lost the feeling

118
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:02,259
of wonder at walking through its winding
streets with their grey-yellow sandstone buildings,

119
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,099
small gardens and multitude of chimneys.

120
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,810
He had arrived here as a naive 18-year-old
and the move from a small Hebridean island

121
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,000
to this elegant and eerie city had been a
shock to the system.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,840
In time, however, the streets,
at least in the area around the university,

123
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,610
had become as familiar to him as the paths
he'd played on as a child growing up on Harris.

124
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:36,800
Today, he wasn't concentrating on the buildings
but was instead thinking about recent events.

125
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,479
Nine months earlier his first novel, a crime
story, had been published and had been an

126
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,839
instant success.

127
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,250
After years of uncertainty about his future,
it had come as a complete surprise and still

128
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,450
hadn't really sunk in.

129
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,920
He'd just returned from a few weeks of PR
stuff in England - the party the night before

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,399
had been in
celebration of that - and now he had some

131
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,960
time to recover from it all.

132
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,311
His publisher wanted him to start work on
the next book, but he didn't fee under any

133
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:11,250
pressure to get started.

134
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,700
Plus he had no idea what it should be about.

135
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:21,360
Pushing those thoughts to one side, he remembered
how touched he was that his friends, Ross

136
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,690
especially, had organized a party for him.

137
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,160
He
smiled to himself; everyone had been so complimentary

138
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,630
and Susie in particular had looked at him
differently.

139
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,700
Or, at least, so it had seemed to him.

140
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,490
He just hoped he hadn't made a fool of himself
- the end of the evening was a bit of a blur.

141
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,640
Sighing, he stopped to work out where he was.

142
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,320
Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight
of a black shape.

143
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,360
It disappeared as he turned
around.

144
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,350
Was he still hungover?

145
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:05,779
No, there it was again: two dark eyes, a pink
tongue and a quizzical expression.

146
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,120
The lead hanging from its collar confirmed
Angus's suspicion.

147
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,760
The runaway dog.

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,540
Now, would it let him catch it?

149
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:24,459
Angus stood, eyes fixed on the dog; the dog
stared back; they both seemed to be thinking.

150
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,140
Then Angus raised his eyebrows, he'd had a
brainwave.

151
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,720
The dog sat down, intrigued by Angus's actions.

152
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,571
He had lifted up his jacket and was patting
the pockets, muttering to himself, "I'm sure

153
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,089
it's still here.

154
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:43,690
What did I do with it?"

155
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,190
before smiling, "Aha!"

156
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,880
He pulled out a crumpled crisp bag, opened
it and lay it flat on

157
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,240
the ground, the flattened contents letting
off an appetizing aroma of salt and vinegar.

158
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,550
He took a step back and waited.

159
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,279
The dog looked at the crisp bag, looked at
him, looked back at the bag, and after a brief

160
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:15,649
hesitation moved forward to lick up the tasty
mixture, tail wagging.

161
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,279
Angus saw his chance and picked up the end
of the lead.

162
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,779
The dog raised its head again but with a seemingly
defeated air, finished off the crisps before

163
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:32,080
letting Angus quietly lead him down the
road.

164
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,450
CHAPTER THREE

165
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,380
Walking back the way he had come, Angus could
see police officers clustered around the police

166
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,550
station on St Leonard's Street.

167
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,740
Ross and
Susie were there, too.

168
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,950
They spotted him with the dog and a small
group came to meet him a few steps away from

169
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,650
the station.

170
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,730
The dog started whining, then began barking
again.

171
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,690
"How'd you find her?

172
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,220
We've been looking everywhere!" asked a young
officer, taking the lead from Angus.

173
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,910
The dog pulled on it.

174
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,470
"Well, I was just walking through Dumbiedykes,
when I..."

175
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,080
Angus didn't get any further, because everyone
turned to watch as a car drew up.

176
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:22,350
An elegant woman, her face set tight in disbelief,
got out.

177
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,880
Susie muttered, "That must be the wife."

178
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,810
Beside them the dog's barking grew louder
and it pulled at the lead.

179
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,269
Taking the officer by surprise, it once again
got free and ran in the

180
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,580
direction of the woman.

181
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:46,089
She turned and was greeted by outstretched
paws, a wagging tail and silence...

182
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,800
Angus frowned slightly but before he could
articulate his thoughts - the quietness of

183
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
the dog around somebody it knew - the others
were

184
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,630
patting him on the back, "Well done Angus"
and wandering off, back to their duties.

185
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,389
"I'll give you a call later, thanks for your
help," Ross shouted over his shoulder and

186
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:07,260
was gone.

187
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,170
Angus stuck his hands, now free of a lead,
in his pockets, his jacket slung over the

188
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,360
crook of his arm, shrugged and turned towards
home.

189
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,350
He was hungry so he popped into a cafe for
something to eat before walking over the Meadows.

190
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,750
As he crossed the grass on his way to Jawbone
Walk, he spotted the red haired girl from

191
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,120
earlier.

192
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,199
The intensity of the colour combined with
the emerald green dress she was wearing made

193
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,000
her unmistakeable.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,870
She was standing at the edge of the path talking
to a young man.

195
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,040
Something in her body language - her shoulders
hunched, one arm held

196
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,750
tight around herself - said here was someone
who was unhappy.

197
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:00,110
There was something else about her posture
that reminded Angus of something but he couldn't

198
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,649
pinpoint what.

199
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,570
As he walked past them he caught bits of what
they were saying.

200
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,570
From her:

201
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,709
"... can't believe he's gone.

202
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,649
What am I going to do?"

203
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,649
And him:

204
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,310
"You're well rid of ..."

205
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,860
When he was safely past them, Angus stopped
and turned back, but they had also started

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,019
walking, going up the hill towards George
IV

207
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:31,620
Bridge, her long red hair moving in rhythm
to her step.

208
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,350
CHAPTER FOUR

209
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,759
Angus found the events of the day difficult
to put out his mind.

210
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,450
Who was the murdered man?

211
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,010
Was the girl with red hair connected to him?

212
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,910
But until he saw Ross and Susie, he'd have
to leave his questions unanswered.

213
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,149
And even when he saw them, he knew there was
little they'd be allowed to tell him.

214
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:03,320
Instead, he decided to try and do some writing,
get back into a routine after weeks of being

215
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,510
on the road.

216
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,509
But his heart wasn't in it, and
he spent the following two days staring at

217
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:16,589
a blank computer screen, pacing his flat and
trying to persuade his brain to cooperate.

218
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:22,690
It ignored all his entreaties and so Angus
contemplated the pile of ironing instead,

219
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,639
pondered about dinner, wondered at the football
results

220
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,139
and dreamt about Susie's blue eyes and dimply
smile.

221
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:37,410
The only break from this mental torture had
been popping out to buy some milk and the

222
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,720
evening newspaper.

223
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,199
This could at least satisfy some
of his curiosity regarding the dead man: news

224
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,630
of the murder had been made public and the
local paper provided some basic details about

225
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,060
the victim.

226
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:01,060
He was the owner of a small gallery in Stockbridge,
married with no children.

227
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,230
The police had released his name, Geoffrey
Brodie, and were

228
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:12,980
asking for witnesses to come forward with
any information about the night of the murder.

229
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:20,149
Having read these few facts, Angus was about
to Google the name when his phone beeped.

230
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,550
Ross hadn't been in touch since Angus had
returned

231
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:29,050
the dog - no doubt working day and night on
the case - so Angus was surprised but happy

232
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,470
to read his text message:

233
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,509
"Drink?

234
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,600
Blind Poet?

235
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,730
In 20 mins?"

236
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,139
Angus tapped in "Great!

237
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,190
CU at the pub!"

238
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,980
while he looked for his keys and jacket, all
thought of Geoffrey Brodie suddenly forgotten.

239
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,811
He was
about to leave when he had a thought: maybe

240
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,130
Susie would be there...

241
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,310
There was a sudden panic as he quickly shaved,
dug out a crumpled but clean T-shirt and dragged

242
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,529
a comb through his hair.

243
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,110
Ten minutes later he ran out the door.

244
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:11,610
Arriving late, cheeks pink and out of breath,
he found Ross alone except for a half-finished

245
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,230
beer.

246
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,549
They exchanged greetings, Angus got
himself a pint and sat down.

247
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:19,770
"How's it going?"

248
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,559
"Well, could be better.

249
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,640
It's been mad at the station, as you can imagine.

250
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,930
It's not been going well, though we think
we've got a lead now.

251
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,320
But all these people keep calling with information
that turns out to be completely bogus."

252
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,900
"Umm," Angus said sympathetically, "So, what's
the theory?"

253
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,240
"I can't say much.

254
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,320
But, well, let's put it this way: Brodie seems
to have had some very shady friends."

255
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,790
"What kind of thing?

256
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,640
Handling stolen goods?

257
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Drugs?"

258
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,679
Ross gave a non-committal shrug.

259
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,660
Angus was quiet a moment: "So, do you think
a deal went wrong, or something, and ended

260
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,470
badly for him?"

261
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,250
"Something like that."

262
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:13,370
Angus nodded, the germ of an idea had been
planted, perhaps the start of a new story?

263
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,640
His mind wandered as he supped his pint and
looked

264
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,520
unseeingly at the familiar poster-covered
walls of their favourite pub.

265
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,120
His daydreaming was interrupted by Ross getting
up to greet Susie, who had just walked in

266
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,340
the door.

267
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,000
Angus's heart began beating just that
little bit faster.

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,150
"You made it then.

269
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,820
Angus is in his own world again, so I could
use the company."

270
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,179
Ross grinned, "Same as usual?"

271
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,059
Susie just nodded as she sat down with a sigh.

272
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,100
"Hi, Susie, lo-long day?"

273
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,610
Angus stammered.

274
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,370
"Urn, yeah.

275
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,159
It's been non-stop."

276
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,760
She did look tired, but Angus would never
have let on he thought this.

277
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,750
They were silent while they waited
for Ross to return with her drink.

278
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,740
"Thanks," was her reply, when Ross brought
over her G&T.

279
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,299
She took a sip and finally smiled: "That's
better!

280
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,500
So, Angus, how are you?

281
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,809
What have you been up to?..."

282
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,900
With that the conversation started up again.

283
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,950
A few hours later, as they stood on Buccleuch
Street, ready to go home, Angus remembered

284
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,860
the
girl: "Ross, mate, I meant to tell you, there

285
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,320
was this girl - had amazing red hair - standing
watching at Arthur's Seat the other day.

286
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,440
And, well, I saw her again and overheard her
talking.

287
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,020
Something about it being good he was gone.

288
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,659
Do you think she had anything to do with
the murder?"

289
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:56,540
Ross thought a moment but then shook his head,
"I doubt it, she could have been talking about

290
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
anything.

291
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,500
But I'll get someone to look into
it, just in case."

292
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
"OK.

293
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,110
'Night then.

294
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,850
'Night Susie."

295
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,850
"'Night."

296
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,720
"'Night Angus, sleep tight..."

297
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,429
Susie answered with a giggle and a wave.

298
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:18,419
Angus went home, feeling happy to be back
in Edinburgh and to already have a vague idea

299
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:23,410
for his next book.

300
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,990
CHAPTER FIVE

301
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,970
In the cold light of day, the story idea still
seemed to have potential, but Angus knew he

302
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,910
would need to do some research before he could
start building on it.

303
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:43,570
He jotted down a few notes but quickly turned
his attention to Google and Wikipedia, surfing

304
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,059
for anything he could find on gallery owners,
contemporary painting and the Edinburgh art

305
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,840
scene.

306
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,640
As a child he'd loved reading, losing himself
in new worlds which couldn't have been more

307
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,159
different from the reality of his island life.

308
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,280
He'd also written short stories and poems,
but it was only when he started writing his

309
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,799
first novel that he felt he'd finally found
something he was good at.

310
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,220
Nevertheless, the amount of research involved
had surprised him but had also thankfully

311
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,630
turned out to be a
pleasant, if sometimes frustrating, task.

312
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,360
At the moment, though, he could relax and
enjoy it.

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,690
After hour or two's work, while taking a break
from the computer, Angus remembered a

314
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:39,380
university friend, who conveniently worked
in a local gallery run by a Kathleen Reid.

315
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,690
She could perhaps help with some general information
about what was involved in running a gallery,

316
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,559
and also might have some gossip about Geoffrey
Brodie, who Angus still couldn't get out of

317
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,390
his mind.

318
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,880
He sent her a message on Facebook to ask if
they could meet.

319
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,559
She clearly had time to kill, as an answer
arrived only half an hour later.

320
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,240
By 12.30 Angus and Amy were sitting on a bench
with take-away rolls from the deli, a few

321
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,340
tulips swaying in the breeze beside them.

322
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,150
"So, what is it you'd like to know?"

323
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,279
Amy asked as she tucked into her panini.

324
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,340
"I've got an idea for a story and it's revolves
around a gallery owner from Edinburgh..."

325
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,890
"Is this to do with Brodie?"

326
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,690
"Um, yes, in a way.

327
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,950
He's the spark for the whole thing.

328
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,279
Why, did you know him?"

329
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:42,610
"Only by reputation: Kathleen knows - knew
- him and I've often heard her talk about

330
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,620
him.

331
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,340
From what I can gather, he was a terrible
flirt

332
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,080
with a penchant for young female artists.

333
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,530
He'd offer them his support and, as his gallery
was successful, it was good to have him on

334
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,230
your side.

335
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,400
In return...

336
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,720
well, who knows what he expected in return,
but I wouldn't have wanted to be in his debt."

337
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,050
"But his wife...

338
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,050
Did she know?"

339
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,299
"Must have done.

340
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,909
But she had a good life with him, could swan
about the city and jet off to Paris for the

341
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:16,830
weekend, so why would she rock
the boat?"

342
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:23,299
They were quiet for a moment, eating their
lunch; Angus turned over this new information.

343
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:28,450
He wondered if this was common knowledge ...
maybe he should give Ross a call and tell

344
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,850
him, though he probably knew about it already.

345
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:36,200
"Was there anyone in particular he was meant
to be involved with?"

346
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,090
"I don't know.

347
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,110
There seem to have been several over the years.

348
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,429
Can you use that for your story?"

349
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:45,310
Amy looked at him hopefully.

350
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,040
"Ah, yes, possibly.

351
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,929
It's still in the very early stages, and I'm
not sure what direction it might take, so

352
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,419
everything could be useful.

353
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,419
Thanks."

354
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,950
"Not at all," she replied, satisfied, "Glad
I could help.

355
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,660
But I've got to be getting back.

356
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,850
Catch up again soon?"

357
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,990
Angus nodded and watched Amy as she walked
back towards her work.

358
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,870
He found his phone and called Ross.

359
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,190
He repeated the gossip Amy had
passed on, but Ross didn't seem that interested.

360
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,420
"We think we've got our man.

361
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:25,049
Found a connection between Brodie and a guy
we've been watching for years, deals in stolen

362
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,290
art, but has never
been convicted.

363
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,059
He's being brought in for questioning."

364
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:37,660
The call ended, but Angus stayed sitting,
people watching and enjoying the spring sunshine.

365
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,370
A group of art students walked past and he
was

366
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,760
reminded of the red-headed girl in the green
dress: who was she?

367
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,279
And was she connected to Brodie?

368
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,270
Why did he even assume she was an artist?

369
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,760
And what about Brodie's wife, would she really
just sit back and let her husband have affairs?

370
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,029
The police may well have found the
murderer, but Angus couldn't help wanting

371
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:08,610
to know more about the people connected to
the dead art dealer.

372
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:16,790
Perhaps a visit to Brodie's gallery would
provide some of the answers.

373
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,299
CHAPTER SIX

374
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:26,200
As the sun burned through the morning haar,
Angus set off on foot in the direction of

375
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,810
Stockbridge, the arty area of the New Town.

376
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,360
Brodie's
gallery was located in Raeburn Terrace, the

377
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,990
main street running through Stockbridge.

378
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,909
It would be a fairly long walk but a pleasant
one, taking him through the Old Town and into

379
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,040
the Georgian terraces of the New.

380
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,620
With any luck the mist would lift enough to
allow a view over

381
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,179
to Fife and the hills to the north of the
city.

382
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,549
Angus found walking helped the creative process.

383
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:04,279
Today though, he simply let his mind wander;
it was too glorious a day to think about

384
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,940
work.

385
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,990
And in no time, it seemed, he'd arrived at
the gallery, 'Brodie's' written in chic silver

386
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,799
lettering above the door.

387
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,500
Looking through the
window, Angus could see the cliched interior

388
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:25,050
of a gallery: white walls, pale wooden floors,
minimal furniture.

389
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,909
Some brightly-coloured canvases were hung
on the walls and a roughly-hewn sculpture

390
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:32,610
sat in the corner.

391
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:38,440
Stopping to compose himself, he was surprised
to see the crisp-loving Border Collie tied

392
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,419
up to some railings: Brodie's wife must be
here.

393
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:50,130
As he turned towards the door, he almost collided
with two large men striding out of the door,

394
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,860
their leather jackets and aggressive
demeanour not what you'd expect in an Edinburgh

395
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,770
gallery.

396
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:01,649
Slightly flustered, he watched them walk away
before entering the gallery.

397
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:05,669
He stopped in front of the first picture and
stared at it, but

398
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,559
didn't really see it.

399
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,780
He was wondering who the men were and what
they wanted.

400
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:18,990
Slowly, he forced himself to focus; he'd tie
himself in knots if he weren't careful, always

401
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,149
imagining the worst.

402
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:28,590
Calm again he concentrated on what he was
looking at: a landscape of a sunny beach,

403
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,840
the sea gently lapping at the shore.

404
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,309
Adopting the manner associated with people
looking at paintings, he moved slowly and

405
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:41,159
quietly around the room, head tilted slightly
so as

406
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,840
to better enjoy the pictures.

407
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,720
As he walked past, he noticed that a door
at the back of the gallery - probably to an

408
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,380
office or a storeroom - was slightly ajar.

409
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,340
However, he couldn't hear anything, so continued.

410
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,590
Back at the front door he started again, this
time

411
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,559
reading the captions and moving more randomly
here and there.

412
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,809
It didn't take long to realize the paintings
were all by the same person, a woman called

413
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,470
Katrina McPhair.

414
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:20,789
Finding a leaflet on the desk at
the front, he read a short biography of her.

415
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:26,740
She was from Inverness, in her late 20s, had
studied in Edinburgh and was a fan of the

416
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,840
Colourist movement, something which was evident
in her paintings: bold colours, vivid landscapes

417
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,300
and still-lifes, an enthusiasm for all
things Scottish.

418
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,280
There was no photo of her, but Angus couldn't
help wondering if this was the girl with the

419
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,220
red hair.

420
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,860
Deep in thought, he was startled by a voice:
"Hello, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come

421
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,400
in."

422
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,530
He recognized the tall woman as Mrs Brodie.

423
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:03,409
She was expensively dressed and could have
been anything between 40 and 60.

424
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,890
She looked poised
and steady, but a slight redness around the

425
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,399
eyes and nose belied this.

426
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:12,850
She also didn't look too happy to have a visitor.

427
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,279
"Hello, the paintings caught my eye so I came
in for a closer look."

428
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:21,929
He stopped and waited for a reply.

429
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,809
Mrs Brodie turned to look at the painting
nearest them, a brief appearance of pain on

430
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,059
her face.

431
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,840
"Is... is everything all right?

432
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,029
You look...

433
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,520
I'm sorry..."

434
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,980
Angus reached out a hand towards her.

435
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,390
He suddenly felt very guilty for intruding
on this woman's grief and misfortune.

436
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,500
He was ashamed of letting his curiosity get
the better of him, but didn't know how to

437
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,760
put it right.

438
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,590
She had now completely turned away from him,
her hands held up to cover her face, clearly

439
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,260
trying not to cry.

440
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,480
"Should I go?

441
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,990
I should go."

442
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,940
Angus took a step towards the door.

443
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,380
"No, no, please stay.

444
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
I'm sorry.

445
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,020
I just need a moment.

446
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,159
Please have a look around."

447
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,680
With her head bowed, she walked back to the
small office.

448
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,790
Angus hovered, unsure of what to do but, as
she had left the door open, he took

449
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,510
a few steps towards it.

450
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:28,340
He could see her sitting at a small table
and on the counter beside her a kettle and

451
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,510
some mugs.

452
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,350
"Would you like me to make a cup of tea?"

453
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:41,140
He asked hesitantly and received a nod in
reply.

454
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,799
CHAPTER SEVEN

455
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,320
Shortly after, they were sitting opposite
each other, cups of tea on the table.

456
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,690
Mrs Brodie had recomposed herself.

457
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,649
Angus introduced
himself: "I'm Angus."

458
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,059
"Eleanor Brodie.

459
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,040
Did you know my husband?"

460
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,130
"No, I didn't."

461
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,660
"Well, that's no great loss."

462
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,799
She sounded bitter.

463
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,950
"He's gone and now I have to clear up his
mess.

464
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:15,070
It appears the successful gallery owner
wasn't so canny after all.

465
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,940
Seems he wasn't just cheating on me..."

466
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,049
Angus raised his eyebrows slightly but didn't
say anything.

467
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,429
Mrs Brodie didn't appear to notice.

468
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:32,010
"I thought Geoffrey had saved, but it
turns out he owes thousands of pounds.

469
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,310
And to whom?

470
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,350
Some thug!

471
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,350
God!

472
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,840
I don't know what I'm going to do."

473
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,230
The muscles in her jaw tightened as she said
this.

474
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,480
She glanced at him quickly before continuing.

475
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,260
"I don't why I'm telling you this.

476
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,970
I
don't even know you."

477
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:54,659
She stiffened a moment, her gaze once more
directed at him: "You're not from the press,

478
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:55,679
are you?

479
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,290
You look familiar."

480
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,480
Angus blushed, "No, I'm not a journalist,
Mrs Brodie.

481
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,399
But I've written a book, maybe..."

482
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,080
She interrupted him, "Of course, you're the
crime writer.

483
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,700
What exactly are you doing here?

484
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
What do you want?"

485
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,919
Her tone was accusatory.

486
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,360
Angus squirmed in his seat, feeling deeply
ashamed.

487
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,740
The words came tumbling out as he tried to
explain.

488
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,240
"I'm sorry.

489
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,420
I really didn't mean to pry.

490
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:34,299
I heard about what happened and I'm trying
to write a new story and it seemed like a

491
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,169
good idea,
you know, and I saw the dog run away and then

492
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,130
stumbled across her and brought her back,
and then I saw her, and...

493
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,429
I'm sorry."

494
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,590
"It was you who found Jessie?"

495
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,570
Angus nodded.

496
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,179
They sat in silence while Eleanor Brodie thought
about this piece of information.

497
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:03,049
At last, she spoke, "You're going to use my
husband's death in a story?"

498
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,139
"No, not exactly, I'm not sure."

499
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:13,250
Angus took a deep breath, "I'm not explaining
myself very well, I'm sorry.

500
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,250
I'm...

501
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm here because I'm
nosy, I really am sorry, it was very thoughtless

502
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,909
of me.

503
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,860
The story is just a vague idea at the moment,
I don't know how it'll turn out, what it'll

504
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,049
be about."

505
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:31,860
Mrs Brodie didn't answer and Angus wondered
how he could make the situation better.

506
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,800
"Is there anything else I can do for you?"
he asked,

507
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,269
as Mrs Brodie stood up to clear the table.

508
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:44,470
She placed the mugs in the sink and turned
to face him, hands tightly gripping the edge

509
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,950
of the sink.

510
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,200
She looked exhausted.

511
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,330
"You seem to be good with dogs... you could
take Jessie for a while.

512
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,130
I can't look after her at the moment.

513
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,700
You can come round to the house
to collect some food and things for her."

514
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,320
All Angus could do was agree.

515
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,480
CHAPTER EIGHT

516
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,919
Back at his flat, Jessie exploring her temporary
home, Angus thought back over the afternoon.

517
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:21,750
It occurred to him that he should check if
it was OK for him to have the dog, seeing

518
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,609
as it was involved in a police investigation.

519
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:30,429
And he wanted to fill Ross in anyway, so he
dialled his number.

520
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,619
Ross sounded angry and began talking before
Angus could really speak.

521
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:40,700
Apparently the main suspect, the guy who had
been questioned, had an

522
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:46,210
airtight alibi, so he was free, and the police
were back to square one.

523
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,089
They had done some research regarding Brodie's
indiscretions - something which had been brought

524
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:56,639
up by more than one acquaintance of the
deceased, and had a new suspect.

525
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,550
Some officers were on their way at that moment
to bring her in for questioning.

526
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,440
Angus felt himself go cold, "Wh-who are you
bringing in?"

527
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,030
"The wife," was the grim reply.

528
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,609
"Are you sure?"

529
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,660
"Not yet but she had a motive and knew where
her husband was going.

530
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,820
We just need to establish her whereabouts
more exactly at the time of

531
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,410
the murder.

532
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,910
Why?"

533
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:28,380
Angus told Ross about his meeting with Eleanor
Brodie, ending with his question about Jessie.

534
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,370
"Well, it's a bit irregular, but I'll ask
the chief and let you know.

535
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,500
And I know she seems respectable and he was
a scumbag but that

536
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,560
doesn't mean she didn't do it.

537
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,849
I've got to go but I'll get back to you shortly.

538
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,940
In the meantime, keep the dog with you and
take care of her."

539
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,089
With that they hung up and Angus went to find
Jessie.

540
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,730
Sitting down beside her on the living room
floor, he couldn't help but feel

541
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,900
sorry for Mrs Brodie.

542
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:07,589
He also felt a shiver at the idea that he
may have just had tea with a murderer.

543
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:11,160
CHAPTER NINE

544
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,830
Angus had a restless night.

545
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,569
He couldn't stop thinking about the case.

546
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:19,381
What had started as a bit of harmless nosiness
- just research for a

547
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:26,369
story - had turned into something more serious:
he'd had tea with a suspected murderer and

548
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,300
was looking after her dog.

549
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,940
He knew he should disentangle himself but
was finding the whole situation quite thrilling.

550
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,349
It was a puzzle and he liked puzzles.

551
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:41,540
Though he
didn't have access to all the information

552
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,100
the police did, he still wanted to solve the
mystery of the red-haired girl, even if it

553
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,230
was only for his own satisfaction.

554
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,970
He struggled with his conscience telling him
to leave well alone and only finally fell

555
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:01,560
asleep, having decided to put off the decision
until the morning.

556
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,160
It was another sunny day, white clouds dotted
a blue sky, as Angus got up and went to get

557
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,500
showered.

558
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,069
With the water beating down on him, he
reached a decision: he'd stop meddling in

559
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:17,349
the case.

560
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:23,210
He had wanted to relax after all his PR stuff
and that was what he'd do, no more research

561
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,030
and asking questions.

562
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:31,450
With the decision made, he hurried to get
dressed - he wanted to be outside and making

563
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,560
the most of the
lovely weather.

564
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,480
He had a quick breakfast and then left the
flat, Jessie following behind him.

565
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,880
It felt a bit tactless to take her to Arthur's
Seat, so the

566
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,270
Meadows would have to do for a morning walk.

567
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:52,540
With one of the many paperpacks beside his
bed stuffed into his pocket - in this case,

568
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,380
one that Susie had recommended - they set
off along the quiet street.

569
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,940
The park looked lovely in the early-morning
light.

570
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:05,920
The cherry trees which lined Middle Meadow
Walk had only just blossomed and a glorious

571
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,280
haze of pink set against sharp green leaves
and the blue sky created a gorgeous canopy

572
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,130
over his head.

573
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,890
He turned off the path in the direction of
the tennis courts.

574
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,619
Arriving at the triangle of grass at the east
end of the park, he let Jessie off her lead

575
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,700
and found a stick to throw to her.

576
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,910
She brought
it back so obediently to him that he sat down

577
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:38,400
on a bench and started to read his book, only
looking up when she reappeared.

578
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,220
Time passed and he was so absorbed in the
novel, everything to do with the case forgotten,

579
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,670
that he didn't immediately notice that Jessie
hadn't come back.

580
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,069
When he did, he stood up to get a better look
but couldn't see her.

581
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:59,150
Panic mounted as he pictured her running out
into the road behind him.

582
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,349
He rushed towards the centre of the grass,
hoping to see around the hedge that bordered

583
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:09,910
the tennis courts while also
looking over his shoulder for any signs of

584
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,990
a black and white shape on the road.

585
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:19,960
With a sigh of relief he spotted her wagging
tail after only a few steps.

586
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,790
He found her being petted by a red headed
girl he recognized at

587
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:33,130
once: it was the girl from Arthur's Seat,
and possibly, if he was right, the artist

588
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,770
in Brodie's gallery.

589
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,450
Should he speak to her?

590
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:44,810
"Hello, hi there," he said to the figure crouched
down beside Jessie.

591
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,750
She looked up, startled, and blushing slightly
stood up.

592
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:55,630
He understood at once what had struck him
about her before: she was pregnant,

593
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,180
perhaps five or six months along.

594
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,910
"I'm sorry, is she your dog?

595
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,300
I thought I recognized her ..." she trailed
off.

596
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:11,460
"Uh, yes, well no, I'm just looking after
her for someone."

597
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,490
There was a moment's awkward silence and she
looked as if she was about to go: "I think

598
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,119
I've seen you before.

599
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,141
At Arthur's Seat when the
body was found," Angus voiced the first thing

600
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:28,430
that came to mind, wanting to see how she
would react.

601
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:34,630
And was both pleased and disappointed to see
the colour drain from her face and her air

602
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,950
of discomfort be replaced by one of anxiety.

603
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,300
"No, I think you must be mistaken.

604
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,220
I really must be going now."

605
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,980
And with that she turned and was halfway up
the path before Angus could do

606
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,859
anything.

607
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:57,640
He knelt beside Jessie, stroking her soft
ears while his mind went over what had just

608
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,780
happened.

609
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,210
For a dog that so disliked strangers,
Jessie had been incredibly calm and quiet

610
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,900
with the woman.

611
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,910
She must know her, but what did that prove?

612
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:16,069
Suddenly, he realised that he just had to
find out who she was, and all his intentions

613
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:18,800
of doing the right thing went straight out
the

614
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,140
window.

615
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,589
Attaching Jessie's lead to her collar, they
set off in the direction the woman had gone

616
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:28,069
in.

617
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:33,880
Rounding a corner, he saw her and then continued
to follow her as she walked along Bucchleuch

618
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,490
Terrace and over George Square.

619
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,040
He almost
lost sight of her as she weaved around the

620
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,230
students that were going to and from classes.

621
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,630
At Bristo Square, she turned right and, disappearing
under the overpass at Potterrow and going

622
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:56,609
against the stream of law students, hurried
down the cobbled lane to Chamber's Street.

623
00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:01,599
Nearly colliding with a skateboarder, he reached
the street corner and didn't know at first

624
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,240
which way she had gone.

625
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,089
Standing on tiptoe,
trying to get a better look, he finally thought

626
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:14,589
he saw someone with red hair going through
the revolving door of the museum.

627
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:20,660
Apologizing to Jessie as he tied her up outside,
he also entered the light-filled Victorian

628
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,900
atrium and stopped again.

629
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,920
The place was
packed: tourists, pensioners meeting for lunch,

630
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,900
school kids crowded round the fountains with
the goldfish and museum wardens directing

631
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,940
people to different parts of the collection.

632
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,540
She could have gone anywhere - Angus would
just have to take his chances, maybe he'd

633
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,260
be lucky.

634
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,760
Climbing the stairs to the second floor, he
walked into the calm and quiet of the Asian

635
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,230
collections: ceramics, glassware and textiles
were

636
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,700
all neatly displayed behind glass in metal-framed
cabinets.

637
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:04,250
The museum was a maze and it wasn't long before
Angus was lost in its charm, his hope of finding

638
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,849
the girl fading.

639
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:10,630
He became absorbed in
the artefacts around him and nearly jumped

640
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,910
out of his skin when someone said:

641
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,700
"Why are you following me?"

642
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:22,200
It was the girl with red hair and, though
she spoke quietly, she was clearly angry.

643
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,330
Angus again said the first thing that came
to mind:

644
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,760
"Are you Katrina McPhair?"

645
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,220
"Why do you want to know?"

646
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,079
Angus took that as a yes.

647
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:40,180
"I saw you at Arthur's Seat when they found...
when they brought down the body."

648
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:47,210
The girl didn't react, so Angus
continued: "He was - or still is - exhibiting

649
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,619
your paintings.

650
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:51,030
So you must have known him.

651
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,290
And I think you knew him very well, is that
right?"

652
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,170
"Who are you?

653
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,400
What has this got to do with you?"

654
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,430
"Nothing, it's got nothing to do with me,"
Angus admitted.

655
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:07,230
"I was just intrigued."

656
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,359
He was aware of how lame this sounded and
waited for her reply.

657
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:17,010
She looked him up and down and must have decided
he looked harmless as her

658
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,060
posture relaxed a little.

659
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:27,380
"Yes, I knew him, knew him well," she touched
her rounded stomach and her look confirmed

660
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,369
what Angus had suspected - Brodie was the
father.

661
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,819
"But I didn't kill him, if that's what you
think.

662
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:40,180
I was angry but I would never have done that.

663
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:45,500
I loved him," she added softly, eyes on the
ground.

664
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,940
Then she looked up at him, expression firm
once again, "So, leave me alone!

665
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,380
I don't ever want to see you again."

666
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,589
Angus nodded shamefacedly, and waited until
she had left before slowly making his way

667
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,460
to the exit to collect Jessie and go home.

668
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:14,880
He believed her and only wondered what that
meant for Eleanor Brodie.

669
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
CHAPTER TEN

670
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:23,020
He heard nothing from Ross or Susie for a
few days and didn't want to bother them by

671
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,130
calling.

672
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,540
He had to make do with the newspaper and
whatever they printed but, besides learning

673
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:35,270
more about Brodie in his obituary, there was
very little new information.

674
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:41,580
He tidied his flat, walked Jessie and spent
as much time outside as he could.

675
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,420
Coming out of the cinema one afternoon - a
sudden shower

676
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:50,600
having forced him to take cover - he turned
on his phone to find Ross had tried to call.

677
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,839
Dialling his number, he was surprised when
Susie answered:

678
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,079
"Hi, Angus, Ross is just at the bar.

679
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,800
We're at the Peartree House.

680
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,710
Do you want to come and join us?"

681
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,820
"Hi, Susie, does that mean you've solved the
case, then?"

682
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,820
"Yes!

683
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,200
We're celebrating, or rather recovering from
the whole thing.

684
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,530
So, are you going to come or not?

685
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,190
I haven't seen you for a few days."

686
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:21,250
Angus's smile widened at her use of the first
person singular and assured her that he was

687
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,150
on his way.

688
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,210
But could she say first who they'd
charged with the crime?

689
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:33,500
"Well, you know I can't do that, but I suppose
there's no harm in you guessing..."

690
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,670
"Was it Eleanor Brodie?"

691
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,670
"Yup.

692
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,970
But you'll have to wait for the papers to
find out more.

693
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,869
Now, get a move on, your beer won't wait forever!"

694
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,599
Angus laughed and
hurried off towards the pub and his friends.
