CHAPTER ONE
The Charm

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,790
'He's a brave man,' people say about me.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,990
'He's never afraid.'

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,720
They are wrong.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:21,340
I wasn't always a brave man, and at times
I was afraid - very afraid.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,090
I am an important man now.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,029
I have an important job.

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,230
People know me and like me.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,100
They don't know that I wasn't always brave.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,180
I will tell yon the story.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,590
I was a very shy young man.

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,190
I didn't like talking to other young men;
I was afraid.

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,239
'They'll laugh at me,' I thought.

14
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:51,399
Women were worse.

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,110
I never spoke to them; I was always afraid
of them.

16
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,449
I try to help shy people now.

17
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,210
I never laugh at them, because I remember
that time.

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,020
I was very unhappy then.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,960
Then there was a war between my country and
another country.

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,440
I had to be a soldier.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,990
Me!

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,350
I was always afraid, but I had to be a soldier!

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,380
And it was very dangerous.

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,850
I was afraid.

25
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,570
The other soldiers didn't talk about it, but
they knew.

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,700
'They're laughing at me,' I thought.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,009
'They aren't afraid.'

28
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,660
I was wrong, but I didn't know that.

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,690
I felt very bad.

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,990
One day, I was in the town.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,850
I had two days holiday, away from the other
soldiers.

32
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,840
I wasn't with friends; I didn't have any friends.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,409
I was very unhappy.

34
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,240
I walked slowly past some shops.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,289
An old man stood by the road.

36
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,560
There weren't many cars on it.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,530
'Why doesn't he walk across the road?'

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,750
I thought.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,900
'Is he afraid?'

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,890
I went near him, and then I saw his eyes.

41
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,660
'Oh,' I thought.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,260
'Now I know.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,069
He can't see!

44
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,580
He wants to go across, but he can't go without
help.'

45
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,940
Other people walked quickly past him.

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,209
They had to go to work, or to their homes.

47
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,510
They didn't help him; they didn't have time.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,970
But I had time - a lot of time.

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,239
'I'm not doing anything,' I thought.

50
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,849
'Why can't I help him?

51
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,940
I won't be afraid of him.'

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,230
I took the old man's arm, and I helped him
across the road.

53
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,340
'Thank you!' he said.

54
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,380
His hand felt my coat.

55
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,379
'This is a soldier's coat,' he said.

56
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,800
'Are you a soldier?'

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,230
'Yes.'

58
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,970
Perhaps I said it in a sad voice.

59
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,970
The old man put a hand in his jacket.

60
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,239
He took something out and gave it to me.

61
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,159
'Take this,' he said.

62
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,629
'It will help you.

63
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,650
Wear it, and you'll be all right.

64
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,860
Nothing bad will happen to you.'

65
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,540
He walked away, and I looked at the thing
in my hand.

66
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,750
It was a small charm - pretty, but strange.

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:56,290
'It's a girl's thing,' I thought, and I put
it in my coat.

68
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,930
The next day we went to war.

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,690
I was afraid - very afraid - but I remembered
the charm in my coat.

70
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,849
'Perhaps the charm will help me,' I thought,
so I took it with me.

71
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,730
Suddenly I wasn't afraid.

72
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,900
Why?

73
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
I didn't know.

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,380
Was it the charm?

75
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,960
It was bad that day.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,720
Men died all round me.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,080
'Perhaps I'll die next,' I thought.

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,060
But I wasn't afraid!

79
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,340
Our leader was a brave man.

80
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,610
He was in front of us, and we followed him.

81
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,080
Suddenly he was down.

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,750
He fell to the ground and didn't move.

83
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,210
The other soldiers stopped.

84
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,290
They were afraid.

85
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,280
I thought, 'Perhaps our leader isn't dead.

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll go and see.'

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,530
I went to him.

88
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,410
The fighting was worse now, but I wasn't afraid.

89
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,120
'I've got the charm with me,' I thought.

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,919
'I'll be all right.'

91
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,210
I brought our leader back to a better place,
and then I looked at him.

92
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,810
He was very white and ill, but he wasn't dead.

93
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,930
His eyes opened, and he smiled at me.

94
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,259
He spoke - not easily, but I heard him.

95
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,040
'Go in front!' he said.

96
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,210
'The men will follow you.'

97
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,490
The men followed me, and we fought well that
day.

98
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,320
After that, I was fine.

99
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,160
Later, I was a leader, too.

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,940
The men were happy and followed me.

101
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,030
People didn't laugh at me then.

102
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,520
'But is it right?'

103
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,949
I thought.

104
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,389
'I'm not very brave.

105
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,900
It's only the charm.'

106
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,880
I didn't tell people about the charm.

107
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,350
I had friends for the first time, and I was
happy.

108
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,020
One day we had to take an important bridge.

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,729
There were a lot of soldiers on it, and they
had big guns.

110
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,490
The country was open, without any trees.

111
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,400
It was very dangerous, and my men were afraid.

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,670
'We're going to die,' they said.

113
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,110
'Listen,' I told them.

114
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,080
'I'll go first, and we'll run very quickly
to the bridge.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,860
Don't be afraid.

116
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,550
They can't kill us all.

117
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,600
Follow me, and we'll take that bridge.'

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,470
I put my hand in my coat.

119
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,289
But the charm wasn't there!

120
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,139
'What am I going to do?'

121
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,289
I thought.

122
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,880
'I can't be brave without the charm.'

123
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,830
I looked at the faces of my men.

124
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,050
They weren't afraid now.

125
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,860
I thought, 'My words have helped them.

126
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,240
They aren't afraid now.

127
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,310
They're waiting for me.

128
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,150
They'll follow me everywhere.

129
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm their leader, and I can't be afraid.'

130
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,440
I shouted: 'Let's go!'

131
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,430
We ran.

132
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,430
We got to the bridge.

133
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,870
We lost some men, but we got there!

134
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,490
And we took the bridge!

135
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,090
I will never forget that day.

136
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,970
I learnt something then about brave men.

137
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,670
Brave men are afraid, too.

138
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,520
But that doesn't stop them.

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,550
I will also remember that old man with the
charm.

140
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,060
'It will help you,' he said.

141
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,520
He was right.

142
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,410
I learnt to be brave without it.

143
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,759
I was a young man then, and now I am old.

144
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,569
I am a brave man, people think.

145
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,370
And, yes - they are right.

146
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,370
I am.

147
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,372
- THE END -
