CHAPTER ONE
The Stranger

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:10,950
It was night and we were sitting around a
camp fire in the Arizona desert.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:19,810
In this dry, empty land of rocks and high
hills, we had seen only snakes and birds.

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,539
We had seen no other people.

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,640
Beyond the light of our fire, the darkness
was like a black wall.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,800
Suddenly, a stranger walked into our camp
and sat down.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,710
"You're not the first men to explore this
desert," he said.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,080
We were astonished.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Several men in our group put their hands on
their guns.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,380
But the stranger took no notice of this.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,710
He went on speaking and we listened.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,880
"Four men came here thirty years ago," the
stranger said.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:16,079
"Their names were Ramon Gallegos, William
Shaw, George Kent and Berry Davis.

14
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,140
They came from the town of Tucson.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,940
They were going to California.

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:33,659
Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw, George Kent
and Berry Davis were traveling west.

17
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,020
They were crossing the desert without a guide."

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,299
The stranger repeated the four names.

19
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,100
His voice was soft and he spoke slowly.

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,569
Later, we asked each other these questions.

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,090
Where had this man come from?

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,340
Was he alone?

23
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,899
Where was his own camp?

24
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,360
Why was he in the middle of this desert?

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:11,620
We guessed that the stranger was a lonely
traveler who wanted the company of other men.

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,530
A man can go crazy if he is alone in this
empty place.

27
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,460
The stranger was on the other side of our
camp fire.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:29,060
I could not see his face clearly because my
hat was pulled down over my forehead.

29
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,080
I lifted the brim a little.

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,380
What did the stranger look like?

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,921
Well, there was nothing unusual about the
man.

32
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,310
He looked like any of our own men.

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,950
We were all wearing broad hats and he was
wearing one too.

34
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,840
We looked and listened as he told his story.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,900
Later, we remembered his words, but not his
face.

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,950
"This place was different thirty years ago,
the stranger said "Only Apache Indians and

37
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,960
a few soldiers lived here.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,090
Many men have disappeared in this desert.

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,420
The Apaches killed some of them.

40
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,960
Others died of thirst because they could not
find any water.

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:36,280
The Apaches killed strangers slowly, and in
a terrible way.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,930
We did not want to meet them."

43
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,720
The stranger was silent for a few seconds,
then he went on with his story.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:04:07,510
"The four of us-Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw,
George animals.

45
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:46,810
We were 

46
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,160
able to shoot several of the animals, so at
last we had some food.

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,620
We ate and slept, and soon we felt stronger.

48
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,870
But a few days later, the Apaches found us.

49
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,260
The stranger stared at the flames of the fire
as he spoke.

50
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,270
"The Indians were behind us," he said.

51
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,880
They started shouting.

52
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,020
They had rifles and they started firing them
at us.

53
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,910
There were about forty Apaches, and only four
of us.

54
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,330
We could not fight them all.

55
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:39,590
We tried to hide in the mountains hut the
Apaches followed us closely.

56
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,330
At last, we came to a steep cliff.

57
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,710
We couldn't escape now-we were trapped.

58
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,940
What could we do?

59
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,889
We took our guns and left our horses at the
bottom of the cliff.

60
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,639
Then we started to climb up the wall of rock.

61
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:12,400
There were four of us-Ramon Gallegos, William
Shaw, George Kent and Berry Davis."

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,150
"We've heard those names before," said one
of our own men.

63
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,150
"Tell us what happened."

64
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,919
The stranger took no notice of these words.

65
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,730
He continued his story.

66
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:36,139
"We climbed up the steep cliff and found the
entrance of a cave," he said.

67
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,790
"The Apaches didn't follow us immediately.

68
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,260
They were busy with our horses.

69
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,970
They looked at the equipment that our horses
were carrying.

70
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:56,070
While the Apaches were stealing our equipment,
we went into the cave.

71
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:03,470
The entrance of the cave was narrow, and we
could shoot anyone who came into it.

72
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,760
But we had a problem.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,540
We could not get out at the back of the cave.

74
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,290
For a while, we were safe from the Apaches.

75
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,870
But we were not safe from hunger and thirst.

76
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,680
"The Apaches made their camp outside the cave.

77
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,370
We saw the light of their camp fire.

78
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,190
They were waiting for us to come out.

79
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:38,100
They knew that we would become hungry and
thirsty.

80
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:47,120
We would have to leave the cave after two
or three days, because we had no food or water.

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,979
When we came out of the cave, the Apaches
would kill us... slowly.

82
00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:02,889
"We stayed in that cave for three days and
three nights," said the stranger.

83
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,630
"We took turns to sleep.

84
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:12,180
While three slept, one of us guarded the others.

85
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,140
But we had no food and no water.

86
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,600
No man can live for long in this desert without
water.

87
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,919
A man goes crazy without water.

88
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,760
First he goes crazy, and then he dies.

89
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:38,060
"Ramon Gallegos died first," said the stranger.

90
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,710
"He died in the morning, on the fourth day.

91
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,060
'I'm going to die today,' Ramon said to us.

92
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,110
'But the Apaches won't kill me.'

93
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,140
Then he took out his gun.

94
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,020
He put the muzzle to his head and fired.

95
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,600
And so Ramon Gallegos escaped from hunger
and thirst.

96
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,680
And he escaped from the Apaches.

97
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:20,750
That left three of us- William Shaw, George
Kent and Berry Davis.

98
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,540
"I was the leader," the stranger said.

99
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,790
"I spoke to the others.

100
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,610
'Ramon Gallegos was a brave man,' I told them.

101
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,630
'He knew when to die, and he knew how to die.

102
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,640
It's foolish to go crazy from thirst.

103
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,380
And none of us wants to be slowly killed by
the Apaches.

104
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,930
Let's join Ramon Gallegos.'

105
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,980
William Shaw and George Kent agreed with these
words.

106
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:08,380
"I laid the body of Ramon Gallegos on the
ground and put a handkerchief over his face.

107
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,529
Then William Shaw pointed toward Ramon's body.

108
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,620
'I want to be as peaceful as him,' he said.

109
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,330
George Kent agreed with him.

110
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:27,170
"A few minutes later, William Shaw and George
Kent put the muzzles of their own guns to

111
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,370
their heads.

112
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,010
Then they fired.

113
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:40,550
I laid their bodies beside Ramon Gallegos,
and covered their faces with their handkerchiefs."

114
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,990
One of the men in our group stood up suddenly.

115
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,130
"And you!" he shouted at the stranger.

116
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,709
"You let your friends die, and you escaped!

117
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,779
We ought to shoot you!"

118
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,290
The captain of our group took hold of the
man's arm.

119
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,390
"Quiet, now," he said.

120
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,430
"You're listening to a story.

121
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,300
This stranger has been in the desert a long
time."

122
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:19,350
"The stranger has told us four names," I said.

123
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,590
"His story is about four men.

124
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,670
Is he the fifth man?

125
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,110
How does he know this story?

126
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,209
It can't be true."

127
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:38,810
"It's an old story," said our captain, "And
there is some truth in it.

128
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,920
I heard the story when I was younger.

129
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Many years the army found the bodies of four
men in the desert.

130
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,040
The soldiers said that the Apaches had killed
the men.

131
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,510
The men's bodies were buried near the entrance
of a cave.

132
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,120
I think that the soldiers found the bodies
somewhere near here.

133
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,810
This stranger is telling us the same story.

134
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:16,480
Rut there was never a fifth traveler."

135
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,300
Suddenly the stranger stood up and stepped
away from the camp fire.

136
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:28,580
The flames of the fire were low-they gave
only a little light.

137
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,209
Beyond the firelight, there was darkness.

138
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:38,930
"There were only four men..." the stranger
said,

139
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:46,190
"...Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw, George Kent
and Berry

140
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,640
Davis."

141
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,310
Then he turned and disappeared into the dark,
black night.

142
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,550
At that moment, one of our men ran into the
camp.

143
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,550
He had been guarding our horses.

144
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,690
"There are three men near the camp!"

145
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,990
the guard said.

146
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,540
"I've been watching them.

147
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,680
They're standing out there."

148
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,339
The guard pointed beyond the light of the
fire.

149
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,930
"The men have been there for a while," he
said.

150
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,740
"Something strange is happening here!

151
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,980
The men don't move, and they don't speak.

152
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,970
They're just standing outside our camp.

153
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,950
Who are they?

154
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,089
Are they waiting for something-or someone?

155
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,200
They're frightening me."

156
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:51,170
"Ramon Gallegos, William Shaw and George Kent,"
I said.

157
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:57,720
"I guess that we've been talking to Berry
Davis.

158
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,040
"What kind of fools walk around here at night?"
asked the guard.

159
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,150
"They're standing in the dark, outside our
camp.

160
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,050
They don't speak and they don't move.

161
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,930
I didn't know if we were in danger.

162
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,130
I might have shot them.

163
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,959
I might have killed them.

164
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,170
"You can't kill them," said our captain.

165
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,410
"They're already dead."

166
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:29,660
- THE END -
