1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,860
The Gift of the Magi

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,559
One dollar and eighty-seven cents.

3
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:16,920
That was all.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,430
Della counted it three times.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,810
She was very careful with money and bought
only the cheapest food.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,439
But she only had one dollar and eighty-seven
cents.

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,390
And the next day was Christmas.

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,809
There was nothing to do so she sat down and
cried.

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,830
Della lived in New York City in a poor, little
apartment.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,980
The rent was $8 a week.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,379
The name on the front door of their flat was
"Mr James Dillingham Young".

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:51,800
In the past he earned $30 a week, but now
he earned only $20 a week.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,580
When he came home after work Della always
hugged him.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,690
And this was very good.

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,580
Della stopped crying and dried her face.

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,220
She stood by the window and looked at a gray
cat on the gray street.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,230
"Tomorrow will be Christmas Day and I have
only one dollar and eighty-seven cents to

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,850
buy Jim a Christmas present," she thought.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,100
She wanted to buy him something fine and beautiful.

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,170
She wanted to show him that she loved him
a lot.

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,640
There was a small mirror on the wall and Della
stood in front of it.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,600
Her eyes were bright.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,910
She pulled down her beautiful long hair.

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,540
It went below her knees.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,830
Now, the James Dillingham Youngs had two very
special things.

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,160
One was Jim's gold pocket watch.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,500
It belonged to his father and before that,
to his grandfather.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,120
The other special thing was Della's hair.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
She put up her hair again.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,270
A tear or two fell on the old red carpet.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,590
Then she put on her old brown coat and her
old brown hat and quickly went out with her

32
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,050
eyes still shining.

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,060
She stopped in front of a door with a sign:
Madame Sofronie, Hair Goods.

34
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,570
Della opened the door and saw a big woman.

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,170
"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.

36
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,310
"I buy hair," said Madame Sofronie.

37
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,530
"Take your hat off and show me your hair."

38
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,400
Della's beautiful brown hair fell down.

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,450
"Twenty dollars," said Madame Sofronie and
she touched the long hair with her expert

40
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,450
hand.

41
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,510
"Cut it off, quickly!

42
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,480
And give me the money," said Della.

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,200
During the next two hours Della went to many
stores and looked for Jim's present.

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,060
She found it at last.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,450
It was perfect for Jim: a simple gold chain
for his pocket watch.

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,230
He was proud of his pocket watch but it had
no chain.

47
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,790
The gold chain cost twenty-one dollars, and
Della hurried home happily with it and the

48
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,090
eighty-seven cents.

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,730
When she got home she looked at her very short
hair in the mirror.

50
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,800
"Oh dear, what can I do with my hair?"

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,930
she thought.

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,650
She was very busy with her hair for the next
forty minutes.

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,020
Then she looked in the mirror again.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,430
She looked like a schoolboy with tiny curls
all over her head.

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,959
What's Jim going to say when he sees me?"

56
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:24,959
she thought.

57
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,630
"But what could I do with one dollar and eighty-seven
cents?"

58
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,640
At seven o'clock the coffee was ready and
the frying pan was on the stove.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,180
Jim was never late.

60
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,100
Della had the gold chain in her hand and she
waited for him near the door.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,190
Then she heard his footsteps on the stairs
and she was afraid for a moment.

62
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,260
"I hope Jim still thinks I'm pretty," she
thought.

63
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,560
The door opened and Jim came in.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,930
He was thin and serious.

65
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,730
He needed a new overcoat and he had no gloves.

66
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,030
Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two years
old and he already had a family.

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,630
His eyes were fixed on Della.

68
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,690
She could not understand the look on his face.

69
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,379
He was not angry or surprised.

70
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,180
He simply looked at her with a strange expression
on his face.

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,799
Della ran to him.

72
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,759
"Jim, darling," she cried.

73
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,719
"Don't look at me that way.

74
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:28,190
I sold my hair because I wanted to give you
a present.

75
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,490
My hair will be long again, it grows quickly.

76
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,509
Oh, Jim, say 'Merry Christmas' and let's be
happy!

77
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,379
I have a beautiful gift for you."

78
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,620
"Did you cut off your hair?" asked Jim slowly.

79
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,699
"Yes, I cut it off and sold it," said Della.

80
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,289
"Don't you like me anymore?

81
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,379
I'm still Della!"

82
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,099
Jim looked around the room.

83
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:57,080
"You cut your hair?"

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,650
Jim said again, almost stupidly.

85
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,909
"Yes, I sold it because I love you so much,
Jim.

86
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,520
Shall I get dinner ready now?"

87
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,749
Jim put his arms around Della.

88
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:14,139
Then he took a package from his overcoat pocket
and threw it on the table.

89
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,930
"Don't worry about me, Della," he said.

90
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,879
"I will always love you.

91
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,400
It doesn't matter if your hair is short or
long.

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,879
But if you open the package, you'll see why
I was strange before."

93
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,789
Della was excited and she quickly opened the
package.

94
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,100
She gave a little scream of happiness, but
then she started crying.

95
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:43,749
There were The Combs-two beautiful, tortoise-shell
combs with little jewels.

96
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:46,509
They were the perfect color for her hair.

97
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,939
When Della saw them the first time in a store
window on Broadway, she wanted them.

98
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,289
She knew they were expensive combs and now
they were hers.

99
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,610
But she did not have long hair anymore!

100
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,590
Della held The Combs in her hand and looked
at them.

101
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,400
She smiled lovingly at Jim and said, "My hair
grows very fast, Jim!"

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,610
Then Della jumped up like a cat and cried,
"Oh, oh!"

103
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,610
She showed Jim his beautiful gift.

104
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,759
"Isn't it splendid, Jim?

105
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,749
I looked everywhere to find it.

106
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,710
Now you'll look at your watch a hundred times
a day.

107
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,110
Give me your watch!

108
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,589
Let's see how it looks on the new chain."

109
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:31,499
Jim sat down and put his hands behind his
head and smiled.

110
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:37,669
"Della," he said, "Let's put our Christmas
presents away and keep them a while.

111
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,909
They're too nice to use now.

112
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,580
I sold my watch to get the money to buy you
The Combs.

113
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,080
And now, let's have dinner."

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,219
- THE END -
