CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,560
A Big Day for Ricki

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,640
Ricki wakes up and looks 
out of his bedroom window.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,400
It's a nice sunny morning.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,360
The sky is blue.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,320
He sits up in bed and remembers that 
this is an important day for him.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,080
"Today is the day!" he says to himself.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,040
"Today, I'm going to try out 
for the basketball team!"

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,480
Ricki's school, Howard High, has the 
best basketball team in the state.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,080
They win every game that they play.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,640
They also have the best coach, Mr Bergman.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Training with Coach Bergman 
is difficult and tiring.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,720
He makes the team practice every day 
after school and twice on the weekends.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,920
He's a tough coach, but that's why 
the "Howard Hawks" are the best.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,400
All the boys want to be on the team,  

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,360
and today Coach Bergman is going to 
choose the players for next season.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,920
Ricki's a good player, but he's only a junior and  

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,880
there are a lot of senior 
boys who want to play too.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,640
Ricki's mom interrupts his daydreaming.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,400
"Ricki, time to get up!" 
she calls from the kitchen.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
"Yeah, Mom!" Ricki answers.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
He jumps quickly out of bed.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
He has a shower and goes downstairs.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
His father is at the stove cooking 
breakfast and his mother is making coffee.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,480
"Good morning, Ricki.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,040
Do you want two eggs and toast 
this morning?" his father asks.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,800
"It's a big day for you, son.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
You have your team try-outs!

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,240
You need a good breakfast inside you!"

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,080
"Yes, thanks.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Two eggs, please, Dad," replies Ricki, grinning.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,520
"I'm nervous too!" he adds.

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,000
He takes some milk from the 
fridge and sits down at the table.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
"Don't be nervous, Ricki.

35
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,360
You're a good player.

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,160
I know you're going to get on 
the team," his mom says, smiling.

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
"You practice enough!"

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,720
"Thanks, Mom," says Ricki, 
"but I'm only 16 years old.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,120
Don't forget, I'm only a junior.

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,600
There are lots of seniors who want to play.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,880
They are big and strong."

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,480
Mr Anderson puts Ricki's 
eggs and toast on the table.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
"There you go, Ricki.

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,160
Have some orange juice too - 
you need all your energy today!"

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,520
Ricki eats his eggs and drinks the orange juice.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,640
The doorbell rings and Ricki's 
best friend, Tony Caruso, comes in.

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,440
"Hi, Ricki!

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
Hi, Mr and Mrs Anderson!

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Still eating, Ricki?"

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,760
Tony asks and sits down next to his friend.

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
"Hello, Tony.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,120
You have a big day today, too!" says Mrs Anderson, 
"You're trying out for the team too, aren't you?

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,480
Would you like some orange juice or coffee?"

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000
"Yes, thanks, some juice, please," replies Tony.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
"Yeah, we all need all our strength today!

56
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,360
Coach Bergman's going to be really tough 
on us this afternoon!" laughs Tony.

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,080
"You and Ricki are both talented players 
and you're better than some of the seniors.

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
You're going to do well," says Mrs Anderson.

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,400
"Thanks," says Tony.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
He looks at Ricki's father.

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,480
"What are you reading, Mr Anderson?

62
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,000
Isn't that a photo of Howard High School 
on the front page of the newspaper?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
What does the article say?"

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
"Crime in our high schools is 
increasing," quotes Ricki's dad.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,960
"It says someone broke three windows 
at the high school last night.

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:48,360
They think vandalism and crime is 
increasing in schools in our area."

67
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
At that moment, the phone rings.

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,960
Mrs Anderson answers it.

69
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
"Yes, he is.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
Just a minute, please.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,600
Ricki, it's for you.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
It's Stacy."

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,840
Stacy is Ricki's new girlfriend.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,400
She's in his class at Howard High.

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,880
She's the prettiest girl in 
their year and she's intelligent.

76
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Ricki likes her a lot.

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,320
"Hi, Stacy!" Ricki laughs.

78
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
"What?

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, thanks!

80
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,760
We need some luck.

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Yeah, see you at school.

82
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Bye!"

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,520
"Stacy's a great girl, Ricki.

84
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,280
You're really lucky," says Tony.

85
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,920
Ricki is a bit embarrassed.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,880
He doesn't like to talk about his 
girl-friend in front of his parents.

87
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,720
"Uh, yeah, I know, Tony.

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
Your girl, Trish, er...

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
is nice too," he says.

90
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
"Listen, we want to go to a movie this weekend.

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,600
Do you and Trish want to come with us?" he asks.

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
"Sounds fun!

93
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,880
But, we have to think about basketball 
today, not movies!" says Tony.

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,800
He picks up his glass of orange juice.

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
"Here's to us!

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,120
Today we're going to play like Michael Jordan!" 
The boys touch their glasses and drink.

97
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Ricki looks at the clock.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,560
"Oh!

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,840
It's late.

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,200
We have to go!" he says.

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,760
He picks up his plate, puts it into 
the dishwasher and gets his bag.

102
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,080
"Thanks!

103
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,320
Mom, Dad, see you later!" he calls.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
"Bye, honey.

105
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Good luck!" calls his mom.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,640
"Good luck, son!" shouts his 
dad.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

107
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
CHAPTER TWO

108
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Mysterious Messages

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Ricki and Tony get off the school 
bus and walk towards Howard High.

110
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,520
They're both very tense and excited.

111
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,760
They talk about the try-outs all the way.

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,080
"It's going to be hard to 
study today," says Ricki.

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,640
"I'm too excited, and we have an 
English test this morning, too."

114
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
"Yeah, I know.

115
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,880
It's going to be difficult," says Tony.

116
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,800
They walk to their lockers to get their books.

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
"Hey, Tony!

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,240
Look," says Ricki, "there's 
a note on my locker door."

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
"What does it say?" Tony asks him.

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Ricki opens the note and reads it aloud.

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,120
"Don't go to basketball practice today 
- something bad is going to happen!"

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Ricki looks at his friend, 
puzzled, "What does it mean, Tony?"

123
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,400
"I don't know," says Tony.

124
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,480
"It's probably just a joke.

125
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,680
Maybe someone wants to frighten you.

126
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Maybe someone wants to make the team and 
doesn't want you to come to the try-outs.

127
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,280
Forget it, Ricki."

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
He opens his locker.

129
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,520
A note falls out onto the floor.

130
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,400
"Hey, Ricki!

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
I have a note, too!" he says, surprised.

132
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,480
He reads his note to Ricki: 
"Basketball is for men, not boys.

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't try out for the team or 
something bad is going to happen!"

134
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
"Who is sending these notes?

135
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,080
Who wants to threaten us?" asks Ricki.

136
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,800
"I don't know, but I don't like it," replies Tony.

137
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,240
"Hi, Ricki!" says a friendly voice then, and 
Stacy Johnson walks over to their lockers.

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,640
She is tall, with long blonde hair and blue eyes.

139
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,760
She is smiling at Ricki.

140
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,960
"Hi, Ricki!

141
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,720
Hi, Tony!

142
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
How are you?" she says.

143
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,240
She gives Ricki a hug.

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,520
"Oh, hi, Stacy!" replies Tony.

145
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,920
"Great, how're you?"

146
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,560
"What's the matter?" she asks then, 
seeing his worried expression.

147
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,520
"Is something wrong?"

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,880
"Oh, it's probably nothing," says Ricki.

149
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,920
"We found two notes in our lockers," says Tony.

150
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,840
"We think it's a joke, but..."

151
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
"Can I read them?" asks Stacy.

152
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,040
She looks at the notes.

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,240
"Mmm.

154
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,520
I don't think this is a joke.

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,320
Let's tell the principal!"

156
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,160
"Hey, wait a minute," replies Ricki.

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
"We don't need to do that.

158
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
I think Tony is right.

159
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,200
The notes are jokes.

160
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm not scared.

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
Let's forget them."

162
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,760
"Ricki, these notes aren't jokes!" says Stacy.

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,600
"Someone wants to frighten you.

164
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
But why?

165
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Okay, don't tell the principal, 
but please tell Coach Bergman."

166
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,760
Suddenly the bell rings for their first class.

167
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,160
"Time to go," says Ricki.

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,000
"Look Stacy, don't worry.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,520
These notes are nothing.

170
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,120
See you at lunch."

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,520
"Oh, okay, see you then!" and Stacy walks 
down the hall with a worried expression.

172
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,480
Tony and Ricki go to their computer class.

173
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,680
They switch on their PC's before class starts.

174
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,960
"I want to look at last night's 
basketball scores," says Tony.

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,840
He goes into the Internet.

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,320
"Yeah!

177
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
The Los Angeles Lakers did it.

178
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
They won!

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
They beat the Chicago Bulls!" he shouts.

180
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,600
"I want to check my e-mail," says Ricki, laughing.

181
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,720
Ricki types in the password for his e-mail.

182
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,400
"You have mail," the computer voice says.

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,640
Ricki opens up the first message.

184
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,760
It's from Stacy.

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,680
See you at school!

190
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,240
Love, Stacy
 
 
 
 
 
 

191
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
He opens up the second message.

195
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,080
"Tony, look!" Ricki whispers 
as their teacher comes in.

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,160
"It's another mystery message!"

197
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
"Wow, this is weird!" replies Tony.

198
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,040
"Who is 'Caper'?"

199
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
"I don't know.

200
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,400
The message doesn't come from our school.

201
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
Look at the e-mail address.

202
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Quick!

203
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,200
Check yours and see if you have 
any messages from 'Caper'."

204
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,880
Tony types in his password.

205
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
"You have mail," says the computer voice.

206
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,880
Ricki and Tony look at each other.

207
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
Tony clicks on the new message.

208
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
"Oh my God, it's from 'Caper', 
too!" he says, opening it.

213
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,680
"What are we going to do?" asks Ricki.

214
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,800
"I don't know," says Tony.

215
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,120
"But I know one thing - these stupid 
messages aren't going to stop us.

216
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,920
We're going to go to basketball practice 
tonight and we're going to try out for  

217
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:24,520
the team and nobody is going to stop 
us!!!"

CHAPTER THREE

219
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,480
The Basketball Try-outs

220
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,240
"It's lunchtime.

221
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,080
Thank God!

222
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm so hungry!" says Ricki to Tony as they leave 
their English class and walk to their lockers.

223
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
"Me too!

224
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,720
English is so hard, I'm always hungry 
after our English lessons!" replies Tony.

225
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,960
"It isn't hard, it's easy," says Ricki, laughing, 
"but you have to do the homework, Tony!"

226
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,240
"Yeah, okay, I know," replies his friend.

227
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,880
They put their books away, lock their 
lockers and walk to the lunchroom.

228
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,080
"Hey, there's Stacy and Trish.

229
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,400
Let's eat with them," says Tony.

230
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,080
They walk over to the table 
where the two girls are sitting.

231
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,720
"Hi!

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,760
What's the matter, girls?" asks 
Ricki, seeing their worried faces.

233
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
"Ricki, we're scared," replies Stacy.

234
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
"About what?" asks Ricki.

235
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,080
"About those notes you and Tony 
found in your lockers," says Trish.

236
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,720
"Please show them to the principal," says Stacy.

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
"They could mean trouble."

238
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,880
Just then two tall senior 
boys stop at their table.

239
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
"Hey, Anderson!

240
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,520
Hey, Caruso!

241
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you trying out for the team 
today?" Kyle Martin asks them.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,920
"Yeah, and I'm going to make the 
team, too!" replies Ricki, laughing.

243
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
"Oh yeah?

244
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,040
Well, watch out, kid, you don't 
want anything bad to happen today,  

245
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,440
eh?" says the other senior, 
Pat Jones, with a nasty smile.

246
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Pat and Kyle walk away, laughing, 
to go sit at another table.

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
"I don't like Kyle Martin and Pat Jones.

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
They're bullies.

249
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,600
They always make trouble," 
says Trish, uncomfortably.

250
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,880
"Do you think they wrote the 
mysterious notes?" asks Stacy.

251
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,080
"Remember what Pat said - 'You don't want anything  

252
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,480
bad to happen today'- the same 
words as your note, Ricki."

253
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,280
"No, I don't think they wrote 
the notes," replies Ricki.

254
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,360
"They're creeps but they 
just want to play basketball.

255
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
Writing notes and sending 
e-mails is not their style."

256
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,920
"Sending e-mail threats...?

257
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,280
What do you mean?" says Stacy, looking at him.

258
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,960
"Oh nothing, honey, forget it," replies 
Ricki quickly, as he sees Tony's expression.

259
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,680
"Let's talk about something else," says Tony.

260
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,720
"What movie do you want to 
see this weekend, girls?"

261
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,560
After school, Ricki and Tony go to the changing 
rooms to get ready for the basketball try-out.

262
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,520
While they are putting on their 
sports clothes, Pat Jones comes in.

263
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,400
He pushes Ricki roughly.

264
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,480
Ricki falls against the lockers.

265
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,720
"Hey, watch out, Pat!" shouts Ricki angrily.

266
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,120
"Why?

267
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,520
What are you going to do, kid?" Pat 
laughs and walks out of the changing room.

268
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,960
"Forget it, Ricki," says Tony 
calmly, "he wants you to get angry.

269
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,480
He wants you to play badly so 
you can't get on the team."

270
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,640
"Yeah, you're right, Tony.

271
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,640
He's a moron," says Ricki after a moment.

272
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,240
"Come on!

273
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,920
Let's go out there and show them who's the best!"

274
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Ricki and Tony walk out onto 
the basketball court, grinning.

275
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,200
"Okay!

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,840
Everyone, onto the court!" shouts Coach Bergman.

277
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,200
Twenty-five boys get up and 
run onto the basketball court.

278
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Twenty-five boys want to be on the 
team but only twelve boys are needed.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,680
Everyone is nervous.

280
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,920
The players practice for an hour.

281
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
Finally, Coach Bergman shouts, "Okay, 
we are going to play a game now.

282
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,360
I want to watch you play so I can choose 
the boys to be on the school team.

283
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,640
Play hard and play well, boys!

284
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,000
Good luck!" Tony and Ricki and three other 
boys are in Team A in the white shirts.

285
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,120
Pat Jones and Kyle Martin are in 
Team B with some of their friends.

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,080
They're wearing the red shirts.

287
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,680
Coach Bergman blows his whistle and shouts,  

288
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,640
"Let's play!" He blows the 
whistle again and the game begins.

289
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,200
Tony takes the ball and throws it to Ricki.

290
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,160
Ricki dribbles down the court, 
dodging his opponents, to the basket.

291
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
He plays the ball well.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,960
He sees Pat Jones coming towards 
him and tries a shot at the basket.

293
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,520
It's a good shot but he's too far from the basket.

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,800
He misses.

295
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,440
Tony catches the ball on the rebound and shoots.

296
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,360
Swish!

297
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,880
The ball goes straight into the basket!

298
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,080
Two points for Team A!

299
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Kyle Martin catches it and 
runs off down the court.

300
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,600
He crashes into Tony who falls to the floor.

301
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,200
"Hey, Martin!

302
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Watch out!" shouts Coach Bergman.

303
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,360
"Sorry, Coach!" shouts Kyle hut Ricki 
sees him look at his friend Pat and grin.

304
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,600
The teams play for fifteen minutes.

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,760
In the end, Team A wins by 
sixteen points to twelve.

306
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,200
"What do you think?" asks Ricki, as 
he wipes his face with his towel.

307
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
"I don't know.

308
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,920
It's going to be a really difficult 
decision for Coach Bergman.

309
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,000
I sure hope we make the 
team, Ricki!" replies Tony.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
"Me, too," says Ricki.

311
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,520
"Anyway, Tony, one thing is sure - those 
mysterious messages were just a joke.

312
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,880
Nothing bad happened at the try-out."

313
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,920
"No, it didn't - not yet," says 
Tony.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

314
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,160
CHAPTER FOUR

315
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,280
A Hit-and-Run

316
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,960
The next day Ricki and Tony 
arrive at school early.

317
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,600
There is a van from the local 
newspaper in front of the school.

318
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,080
Two journalists are talking to a group 
of students outside the school gates.

319
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,000
"Why are those news reporters 
here?" asks Ricki, surprised.

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,080
"I don't know," replies Tony.

321
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,680
"Look!

322
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,840
Trish, Stacy and Mr Stockton are talking to them.

323
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,240
Let's find out what's going on."

324
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,360
"Mr Stockton, we are doing another news article  

325
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,840
about the increasing problem 
of crime in our high schools.

326
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,120
Is there a lot of crime at Howard High?" 
one news reporter is asking the principal.

327
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,760
Mr Stockton says, "No, we 
don't have much crime here.

328
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,320
Sure, we have some vandalism and we 
have some minor discipline problems.

329
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,280
A few students have truancy 
problems, but there's nothing major.

330
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,920
I think our students feel safe here."

331
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,680
"Stacy and Trish, do you feel safe at this 
school?" the other reporter asks the girls.

332
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,760
"Yeah, usually I feel safe," replies Trish, 
"but there are some bullies at the school."

333
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
"What exactly do you mean?

334
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
What do they do?" asks the reporter.

335
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,200
"Well, some students are 
using notes and e-mail..."

336
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,080
But Stacy interrupts her friend, "No, we 
don't have a lot of crime at our school, sir.

337
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,200
We feel very safe here."

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,880
She frowns at Trish and whispers, "Not yet.

339
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,600
We don't have any proof, Trish."

340
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,240
Trish nods her head.

341
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,560
She smiles at the reporters.

342
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,960
"Yes, all in all we feel safe at 
Howard High - it's a good school."

343
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,240
"Well, thank you, Trish,  

344
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,480
Stacy and Mr Stockton for your time," 
says the reporter, closing his notebook.

345
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
"Don't mention it," replies the principal.

346
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,000
"You're welcome," say Stacy and Trish.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,360
Tony and Ricki run to catch 
up with Stacy and Trish.

348
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,240
"Hey, what did they want?" asks Ricki.

349
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,960
"They're writing another story on crime in high 
schools like the one in the newspaper yesterday.

350
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Remember the broken windows at 
school the other day?" says Trish.

351
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,240
"They're trying to find out what happened, 
who the vandals are and why they did it."

352
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,480
"So why were they asking you?" asks Tony.

353
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,840
"I don't know, maybe because 
we're so gorgeous!'' jokes Trish.

354
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,520
"Ricki, you and I have two famous 
girlfriends!" he replies and everybody laughs.

355
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,800
"Hey, what happened at the try-outs 
yesterday?" Stacy asks then.

356
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,440
"Are you two on the team?"

357
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,680
"We are going to find out 
at lunchtime," says Ricki.

358
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,440
"Let's meet at the gym then," says Trish.

359
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,000
"Okay!

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,320
See you there!" replies Ricki.

361
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,640
The four friends meet at the gym later.

362
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,160
Tony and Ricki see two boys 
standing near the coach's door.

363
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
Their heads are down.

364
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,320
They're not smiling.

365
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,200
"Oh no!" says Ricki.

366
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
"Eric Caplin and John 
MacMillan aren't on the team.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,280
Look at their faces!

368
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
They're seniors, too.

369
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,200
I think they're very good players."

370
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,360
"Well, obviously, Coach doesn't agree.

371
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,840
Keep your fingers crossed," says Tony.

372
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,680
"Let's hope we make the team."

373
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,840
They walk to the noticeboard outside Coach  

374
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,280
Bergman's door and look at 
the team list anxiously.

375
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,960
"Yahoo!

376
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,440
Congratulations, Ricki and 
Tony!" cries Trish suddenly.

377
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
"You're on the team!

378
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,520
Look, there are your names!"

379
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,600
"Hey, that's great!" shouts Stacy, hugging Ricki.

380
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,760
"You're the best!"

381
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,920
Eric Caplin comes over to them.

382
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,760
"You were lucky this time, Caruso 
and Anderson!" he says furiously.

383
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,520
"But remember you're just kids.

384
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,360
Coach made a big mistake," and he walks away.

385
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,160
"Why is he so angry with you?" asks Trish.

386
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,280
"I suppose it's because he's 
a senior but he isn't on the  

387
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,840
team," replies Tony, shrugging his shoulders.

388
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,320
"Okay, bur why is he so nasty?

389
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,360
He's really hostile," says Trish, puzzled.

390
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,800
"Hey, forget Eric Caplin - 
he's an idiot," says Stacy.

391
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
"Let's celebrate guys!

392
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,840
Let's go have pizza for lunch!"

393
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,120
Ricki, Tony, Stacy and Trish walk out of the 
school towards the pizzeria, laughing and talking.

394
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,240
Ricki turns to say something to 
Stacy as he steps off the curb.

395
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,160
Suddenly, a car with dark 
windows comes round the comer.

396
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,800
It speeds towards Ricki, 
getting faster and faster.

397
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,840
Nobody knows whose car it is.

398
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,280
They can't see the driver.

399
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,800
"Ricki, watch out!" shouts Tony, and 
Stacy screams, but it's already too late.

400
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,000
The car hits Ricki and knocks him down onto 
the road, then speeds off without stopping.

401
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,760
He lies on the road; his face is white.

402
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,680
His friends surround him.

403
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,040
"Ricki, Ricki, are you all right?" cries Stacy.

404
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,080
"Ricki, can you hear us?" shouts Tony.

405
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,320
A small pool of blood is 
forming under Ricki's head.

406
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
His eyes are closed.

407
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,520
He doesn't 
reply.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

408
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
CHAPTER FIVE

409
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,520
Emergency

410
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,600
"Ricki?

411
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
Ricki, can you hear me?" asks Mr Stockton.

412
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,120
The principal kneels next to Ricki 
and puts his hand on his head.

413
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,640
Ricki is lying on the ground but he isn't moving.

414
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,720
His eyes are still closed.

415
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,040
"Stacy, call Ricki's parents and 
tell them about the accident.

416
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,880
Tony and Trish, ask for an ambulance.

417
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,360
Ricki needs to go to hospital."

418
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,920
Stacy uses her cell phone 
to call Mr and Mrs Anderson.

419
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,440
Trish runs into the school to call the 
hospital but she can't find a telephone.

420
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,560
She stops one of the students 
and says, "Please help me.

421
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
This is an emergency.

422
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,560
We need an ambulance - can I use your cell phone?"

423
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,000
The girl looks shocked.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
She gives Trish the phone.

425
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,120
"Hello?

426
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
911?

427
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,200
We need an ambulance at Howard 
High School immediately.

428
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,720
There has been a road accident.

429
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
It's an emergency!

430
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,000
Please hurry!"

431
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,320
"Ricki, can you hear me?" asks Mr Stockton again.

432
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
He looks at Stacy.

433
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,040
"Stacy, you try.

434
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,720
He knows your voice," he says.

435
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,040
Many of the students are 
coming out from the school now.

436
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,080
They stand together, pointing 
at Ricki and talking.

437
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
"What's the matter?" asks one girl.

438
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,160
"Ricki Anderson had an accident.

439
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,360
A car hit him," replies another girl.

440
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,680
"Is he dead?" says the first.

441
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,040
"Oh God, I don't know, but he isn't moving."

442
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
Stacy is trying to talk to Ricki.

443
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,080
She is crying but she tries 
to make him hear her voice.

444
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,280
"Ricki, can you hear me, honey?

445
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,760
Ricki, it's Stacy.

446
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,520
Please, say something!" Mr Stockton looks 
carefully at Ricki, "He's breathing normally.

447
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,240
I don't think he is hurt badly 
but his head is bleeding.

448
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,280
He could have concussion."

449
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
Mr Stockton looks at the 
crowd of curious students.

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,520
"Did any of you kids see the accident?" he asks.

451
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,800
"Yes, me," says Charlie Bell.

452
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,440
"A red car came out of the parking lot very fast.

453
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,200
It went straight at Ricki and knocked him down."

454
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,160
"What about the driver?" asks Mr Stockton.

455
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
"Who was it?"

456
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,640
"I don't know.

457
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,200
The car had dark windows, but I think there 
were two people in the car," replies Charlie.

458
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,400
"Did you recognise them?" asks Mr Stockton.

459
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,800
"No, sorry, Mr Stockton," replies Charlie.

460
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,080
Suddenly, Ricki moves a little bit.

461
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
He groans.

462
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,240
"Ohhh, my head hurts!" he says.

463
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,280
"Oh, Ricki, you're okay!" cries Stacy.

464
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,720
She holds his hand.

465
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,240
She is crying.

466
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,840
"My leg, I can't feel my leg," Ricki says weakly.

467
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,680
"Help me, please."

468
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,920
Tony kneels down next to his friend.

469
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,840
"Ricki, listen.

470
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Don't move.

471
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
The ambulance is coming.

472
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Your parents are going to the hospital," he says.

473
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,920
Ricki is very weak.

474
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,400
He can't speak hut he nods his head.

475
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,440
The ambulance drives up to the school, its 
siren flashing, and two paramedics get out.

476
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
"Move please, kids," says one of the men.

477
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,080
"We want to talk to the boy."

478
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,960
"What's your name?" the paramedic asks Ricki 
while his colleague examines him carefully.

479
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,920
"Ricki...

480
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,560
Anderson," replies Ricki very quietly.

481
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,760
He tries to move and groans with pain.

482
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,280
"No, don't move, son.

483
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,040
Where's the pain?" asks the paramedic.

484
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,320
"In my head and in my leg," replies Ricki.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,680
"What happened?" asks the other 
man, looking at Mr Stockton.

486
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,960
"It was a hit-and-run," says Mr Stockton.

487
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,960
"A car knocked him down, then drove away."

488
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,080
"In that case we must inform the 
police," replies the paramedic,  

489
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,840
pressing a number on his cell phone.

490
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,120
They put Ricki on the stretcher 
and take him to the ambulance.

491
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,840
Stacy gets into the ambulance too.

492
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,320
"Ricki, don't worry.

493
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,640
You're going to be okay.

494
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm going to the hospital with you."

495
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,320
She holds his hand.

496
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,320
"Are you a relative, Miss?" asks one of the men.

497
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,040
"No...

498
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,680
but..."

499
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,320
begins Stacy.

500
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,960
"I'm sorry, Miss, but you can't come 
in the ambulance," says the paramedic.

501
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
Stacy gets out again.

502
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,680
She is very upset.

503
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,360
"Don't worry, Stacy, we're going 
to the hospital," says Tony.

504
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,680
"Come on, we can go by bus."

505
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,400
Trish, Tony and Stacy are 
shocked by Ricki's accident.

506
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,520
They sit in silence on the bus.

507
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,800
All of them are thinking that 
maybe it wasn't really an accident.

508
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,680
"We have to find the driver 
of that red car," says Stacy.

509
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,400
"I'm sure he has some connection with 
the notes and e-mails you guys got.

510
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Those notes were not a joke.

511
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,360
Someone wants to hurt Ricki.

512
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:23,720
And Tony - you're 
next!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

513
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,800
CHAPTER SIX

514
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,240
In Hospital

515
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,920
The ambulance arrives at the hospital.

516
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,160
Mr and Mrs Anderson are already there.

517
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,560
They watch anxiously as the paramedics 
pull the stretcher out of the ambulance.

518
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,680
"Oh Ricki!

519
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,080
Are you all right?" asks his mother.

520
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,600
She runs to her son's side.

521
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,040
"Yes, I think I'm all right, Mom," replies Ricki.

522
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,920
"Don't worry."

523
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,800
"What happened, son?" asks his father.

524
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,760
"You can tell your parents the story 
later," says one of the paramedics.

525
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,000
"You must rest now.

526
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,120
Then the doctor is coming to see you."

527
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,720
They take Ricki to the Accident and 
Emergency department and put him to bed.

528
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,680
When they move him from the 
stretcher his leg hurts very much.

529
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,960
His parents are worried when 
they see the pain on his face.

530
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,200
What's the matter with Ricki's leg?

531
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,360
"The doctor is coming soon," the paramedic tells 
them and leaves the family alone in the room.

532
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,160
Ricki starts to tell his 
mother and father the story.

533
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,720
"We were all walking out of the school gates.

534
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,240
One minute Tony and I were 
talking about the basketball team,  

535
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,800
and the next minute a car knocked me down.

536
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,680
I don't remember anything after that," he says.

537
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,040
"Basketball team?" asks Mrs Anderson.

538
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,160
"Oh yeah, Mom - I made the team!

539
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,080
Our names are on Coach 
Bergman's list," says Ricki.

540
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,080
He smiles and then he groans in pain 
as his leg starts to hurt again.

541
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,720
His mom takes his hand.

542
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,560
"Don't worry, honey, the doctor 
is coming now," she says.

543
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,960
At that moment, Trish, Tony and Stacy arrive.

544
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,560
"Ricki, how are you?" asks Stacy.

545
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,280
She comes over to the bed.

546
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,920
She takes his other hand.

547
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
"I'm all right, Stacy.

548
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,960
Thanks," Ricki says smiling.

549
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,720
"The doctor is coming to examine him 
now, Stacy," Mrs Anderson tells her.

550
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,480
"We know about the accident," 
says Mr Anderson to Tony.

551
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,280
"Do you know who the driver of the car could be?"

552
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,760
"No, I'm sorry, Mr Anderson, I don't.

553
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,360
I didn't recognize the car," replies Tony.

554
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,880
"The car has dark windows," adds Trish.

555
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,200
"But Charlie Bell thinks 
there were two people inside."

556
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,000
"It must be someone who hates 
Ricki," says Stacy sadly.

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,560
"Hates Ricki?

558
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,440
Who could hate him?" asks Mrs Anderson, surprised.

559
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,080
Tony frowns at Stacy.

560
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,240
He doesn't want her to tell Ricki's 
parents about the mysterious messages.

561
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,680
A nurse comes in then and introduces himself.

562
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,640
"Hello, I'm Drew Carlson.

563
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm your nurse.

564
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,920
Ricki, please put this thermometer under your arm.

565
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm going to give you an 
injection to stop the pain,  

566
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,360
then the doctor wants to 
do some tests on your leg."

567
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,960
He turns to the others, "I'm sorry, but you 
must all wait outside for a few minutes."

568
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
"Hello, Ricki, I'm Dr.

569
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,320
Brown.

570
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,680
How are you feeling?" she asks kindly.

571
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,440
"Not too bad, Doctor, but my 
leg hurts a lot," replies Ricki.

572
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,720
"Hmmm...

573
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,880
Let's have a look," she says.

574
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
She feels Ricki's left leg.

575
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,200
Ricki cries in pain.

576
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,800
"I want some X-rays of that leg," 
says the doctor to Nurse Carlson.

577
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,520
"Please take Ricki to the X-ray room.

578
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,560
I think your left leg might be fractured, Ricki.

579
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,160
But don't worry, it's not too serious.

580
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,040
We can fix it."

581
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
"Can I still play basketball, Doctor?

582
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,600
I made the school team today and I want to play 
in the championship this year," says Ricki.

583
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,680
"Congratulations!" replies Dr.

584
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,240
Brown.

585
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,960
"But I don't think you can 
play basketball for some time.

586
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,920
We must put a plaster cast on your leg 
and you need to rest it for a few weeks."

587
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,520
"But we start basketball practice 
on Monday!" says Ricki, desperately.

588
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,080
"Sorry, Ricki," says Dr.

589
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,640
Brown.

590
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,160
"Now I want to talk to your 
parents," and she leaves him alone.

591
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Ricki's friends come back in.

592
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,240
"Ricki, we were talking about the 
notes you and Tony received at school.

593
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,400
The notes were right - something 
bad did happen," says Stacy.

594
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,240
"But who is behind all these threats?" asks Trish.

595
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,080
"I don't know," says Tony.

596
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,600
"What about 'Caper'?

597
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,720
That's the name on the e-mails."

598
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,560
"I think we have to find the 
driver of the car," says Trish.

599
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,560
"Who has a red car in our school?"

600
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,760
"That's going to be impossible, Trish.

601
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:03,480
I think it was a Subaru, but there are a lot of 
red Subaru’s in town and the car could be stolen."

602
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,080
"Wait a minute, I remember 
something," says Stacy slowly.

603
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,920
"The car has an unusual wheel!

604
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,400
The back wheel on the right 
was different from the others."

605
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,880
"That's a good clue," says Tony.

606
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,680
"I'm sure 'Caper' and the red car are connected.

607
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,000
When we find Caper, we find the mystery driver!"

608
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,680
"Don't worry, Ricki, we're going to find 
out who is doing all this," says Trish to  

609
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,080
her friend, and Stacy and Tony nod in agreement.

610
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:42,040
"You bet!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

611
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,960
CHAPTER SEVEN

612
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,760
More from Caper

613
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,680
The next day Ricki comes home from the hospital.

614
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,960
His friends telephone him from school.

615
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Stacy puts her phone on "speaker" so that 
they can all talk to Ricki and hear him.

616
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,600
"Hi Ricki!

617
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,400
It's us.

618
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,880
How are you?" asks Stacy.

619
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,400
"I'm fine," says Ricki.

620
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,720
"But my leg's in a cast so I have to stay in bed.

621
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,760
I want to be at school with all of you.

622
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,080
It's boring here at home alone."

623
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,720
"You need to rest so that your 
leg can get better," says Tony.

624
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,280
"I'm going to talk to Coach Bergman today.

625
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,600
I think he's going to let you stay on the team.

626
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,160
He's a good guy."

627
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,200
"Thanks, Tony," replies Ricki.

628
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,840
"Oh, and a news reporter is 
coming over to my house today.

629
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,520
She wants to interview me about the accident.

630
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,360
I'm going to be on TV!"

631
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
"Mr Stockton wants to see us today, too.

632
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,400
We're going to tell him about Caper," says Stacy.

633
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
"I don't think that's a good idea.

634
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,720
He's going to think we're 
just stupid kids," says Ricki.

635
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,600
"We have to find out some more about Caper first.

636
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,080
We need more proof.

637
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,520
Then we can tell the principal."

638
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,640
"Okay," agrees Tony after a 
pause, "but I don't like it.

639
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,880
These people could be dangerous - 
look what happened to you, Ricki!"

640
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,000
Ricki hears the school bell ringing.

641
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,560
"We have to go to class now," says Trish.

642
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,720
"See you after school!

643
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,200
Bye."

644
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,040
Later that day the doorbell 
rings at Ricki's house.

645
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:15,160
Mrs Anderson brings a news reporter, a sound 
technician and a camera man into the living room.

646
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Ricki is lying on the sofa.

647
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,440
The camera man sets up his camera 
and begins to film the interview.

648
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,800
The sound technician holds the microphone over  

649
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,800
their heads and begins to 
record their conversation.

650
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,440
The news reporter introduces herself to Ricki.

651
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,920
She asks him a lot of questions about crime 
in his school, the accident, and his injuries.

652
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,040
She thinks Ricki's accident could be 
connected to the vandalism at school.

653
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,480
Ricki isn't sure.

654
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,440
He tells her about the basketball team 
and how he can't play in the championship  

655
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,520
until his leg gets better, but he doesn't 
tell her about Caper and the messages.

656
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,360
He doesn't tell her that he suspects 
some of the basketball players.

657
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,880
He knows they can't prove there is a 
connection between them and the accident.

658
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,480
Not yet.

659
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,400
During lunchtime at school, Tony, Trish 
and Stacy go to the computer room.

660
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Tony opens his e-mail.

661
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
There is another strange message.

662
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,760
It says:
 
 
 
 
 
 

663
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,880
From: caper@whosemail.com

664
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:24,067

665
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,800
Subject: warning

666
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,760
Message: Anderson's accident wasn't an accident.

667
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,200
You are next Caruso!
 
 
 
 
 
 

668
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,240
"Tony, I don't like this," says Trish.

669
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,320
"Let's tell Mr Stockton now."

670
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,360
"Not yet, Trish.

671
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,160
I want to send our friend Caper 
an answer this time," says Tony.

672
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,840
He hits the "Reply" button 
and writes his message.
 
 
 
 
 
 

673
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,693
From: tonyc@hhs.k-12.il

674
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,840
To: caper@whosemail.com

675
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,880
Subject: challenge

676
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,160
Message: I'm not afraid.

677
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,120
We're going to find you.

678
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,920
Start running sucker!
 
 
 
 
 
 

679
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,160
"Tony, do you think that's 
a good idea?" asks Stacy.

680
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,560
"If Caper gets angry, who 
knows what he's going to do?"

681
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,680
"I want to provoke him," replies Tony.

682
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,960
"I want to know who 'Caper' is.

683
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,240
I think if he gets mad, he's going to make 
a mistake, and then we can identify him."

684
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,400
"Let's go to Ricki's house and talk to him 
about it after school," suggests Stacy.

685
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,320
"We can make a plan."

686
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,040
"Good idea," agrees Trish.

687
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,640
"Four heads are better than three!"

688
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,080
After school, the friends 
go over to Ricki's house.

689
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,480
"How's your leg, Ricki?" asks Tony.

690
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,880
"It really hurts.

691
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,840
I don't know when I'm going to be able to walk,  

692
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,240
much less play basketball," 
answers Ricki, gloomily.

693
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,640
"How was school?"

694
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,040
"Tony got another e-mail 
from Caper," Trish tells him.

695
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,280
"We're worried."

696
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,360
Tony tells Ricki about the message and his reply.

697
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,960
"We have to find out who Caper is," says Ricki.

698
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,640
"That's the key to the mystery."

699
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,440
"I think he's a basketball player," says Stacy.

700
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,280
"He wants to hurt you and Tony 
because you made the team.

701
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,760
It you two can't play, Coach Bergman 
is going to need two more players.

702
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,320
Maybe Caper hopes to get on the team that way."

703
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
"Maybe it's Kyle!" says Trish.

704
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
"Remember, he knocked you down at practice, Tony."

705
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,720
"Yeah, but maybe it's Pat.

706
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,160
He said something bad was going to 
happen in the lunchroom," answers Ricki.

707
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,200
"Or, maybe it's Eric, or John.

708
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,760
They're seniors and they're 
not on the team," adds Tony.

709
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,280
"How can we find out who Caper is?

710
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
There are too many suspects," says Stacy.

711
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:08,080
"Listen," replies Ricki, "I have an 
idea."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

712
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
CHAPTER EIGHT

713
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
Ricki's Plan

714
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,080
His friends listen carefully 
as Ricki explains his plan.

715
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,800
"I want to have a party.

716
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,960
I want to invite all the 
players from the try-outs.

717
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,240
Maybe one of the players knows something 
about the messages and the accident!" he says.

718
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,360
"Do you think 'Caper' is 
going to come?" asks Stacy.

719
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,920
"If he's one of the players, he's 
going to be invited," replies Ricki.

720
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
"I think it's a dangerous idea," says Trish.

721
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,760
"This Caper is a dangerous person.

722
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,880
He could do something to hurt 
you or Tony at the party."

723
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,760
"But we want to find out 
who Caper is," answers Tony.

724
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,200
"He wants to stop us from playing 
basketball but I'm not going to let him."

725
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,000
The friends plan the party.

726
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,280
They're going to have a lot of food and drinks.

727
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,800
They are also going to have music and dancing.

728
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,760
The party is going to be in Ricki's back yard.

729
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,080
Tony says he can bring his new CD player, and 
Trish and Stacy are going to buy the food.

730
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,320
Ricki makes a list of twenty-five 
people to send invitations to.

731
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,960
The friends write the text 
of the invitation together.

732
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,600
It says:
 
 
 
 
 
 

733
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,080
You are invited to Ricki's "Get 
well soon" and birthday party!

734
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,560
On : Friday, February 4th At : 9:00 p.m.

735
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,240
Where : Ricki Anderson's 
house 495 Columbus Drive
 
 
 
 
 
 

736
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Friday night comes at last.

737
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,120
Everything is prepared for the party.

738
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,520
There are hot dogs, burgers, salads and chips.

739
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,960
Tony brings the Cokes and sodas.

740
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,160
Ricki walks with his crutches 
out into the back yard.

741
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,440
Tony is putting up lights 
and setting up the CD player.

742
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,440
"Sorry that I can't help much," says Ricki.

743
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,760
"Hey, don't worry.

744
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,400
You have to rest so you can get better 
quickly, then you can play basketball again."

745
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,440
The doorbell rings.

746
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:58,760
"Oh!

747
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,520
Here is our first guest!" says Ricki.

748
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,000
"I want to answer the door.

749
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,320
Remember our plan, everybody."

750
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,480
The others nod.

751
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,320
They are going to try and find out about Caper 
by talking to the players during the party.

752
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,680
They need to know who is jealous of Ricki 
and Tony and who drives a red Subaru.

753
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,320
They also need to find out who uses e-mail a lot.

754
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,560
Could the name "Caper" be 
a code word for something?

755
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,120
The friends all feel excited and tense.

756
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,440
What's going to happen tonight?

757
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
Two of the basketball players 
from the team are at the door.

758
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,240
"Hi, Ricki!" says Anthony.

759
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
"Good to see you.

760
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,360
How are you?

761
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,000
We miss you at practice."

762
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,200
"I miss it too, but Tony always 
tells me about it," replies Ricki.

763
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
"You guys work hard!

764
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,680
The party's out back in the yard.

765
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Have fun!" Later Stacy is talking 
to Ricki when the bell rings again.

766
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,800
"Oh, hi, Pat.

767
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
Hi, Kyle," says Ricki.

768
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
"Nice to see you!

769
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,000
Come in - the party's in the yard."

770
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,440
"Thanks, Anderson.

771
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,200
We're here with Eric Caplin and John Roberts."

772
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
"I don't see them," says Stacy, 
looking out into the street.

773
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
"Where are they?"

774
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
"Oh, they're parking the car," 
replies Pat, looking away.

775
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
"In the next street?" asks Stacy, incredulously.

776
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,360
"Oh, umm...

777
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,720
Eric's car makes a lot of noise, so he's parking 
it in the next street," replies Kyle quickly.

778
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
"He doesn't want to annoy your neighbors."

779
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,960
"That doesn't sound like Eric 
Caplin at all," thinks Stacy.

780
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,440
"He's not usually so considerate!"

781
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,320
Eric and John arrive soon after 
and join the rest of the party.

782
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,280
The music is playing loudly and 
a lot of people are dancing.

783
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,720
Trish notices Eric and Pat talking 
together in a dark corner of the garden.

784
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,880
She looks around to see if anyone is watching her,  

785
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,080
then goes around the trees behind 
them so that they can't see her.

786
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
She goes nearer and listens to them.

787
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,400
"They don't suspect anything," Eric is saying.

788
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,000
"They're too stupid."

789
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,720
"Well, it was a risk to bring the car tonight.

790
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,200
That wasn't clever, Eric," replies Pat.

791
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,520
"I parked it in the next street so they can't see  

792
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,560
it and the mechanic is going 
to change the wheel on Monday.

793
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,560
No one will recognize my car then," says Eric.

794
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,800
"I hope not.

795
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,440
We could get into trouble."

796
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,840
Pat is nervous.

797
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,800
"Hey, don't worry, Pat.

798
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,720
Anderson isn't going to play basketball again, and 
we're going to stop Caruso, too," replies Eric.

799
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,480
"Mmm.

800
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Let's go back to the party before 
someone notices us," Pat says.

801
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,040
Trish quietly comes out of the 
shadows and goes over to Tony.

802
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,160
"Tony, quick!

803
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,720
Get Stacy and Ricki and meet me 
in Ricki's room in five minutes.

804
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,640
I have something important to tell all of you."

805
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,120
The four friends are sitting on Ricki's 
bed looking expectantly at Trish.

806
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,920
"What is it, Trish?" asks Stacy.

807
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,240
"I think I know who the driver of 
the red car is!" replies her friend.

808
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,800
"Who?" asks Ricki.

809
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,320
"Eric Caplin.

810
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,040
Now he wants to stop Tony too."

811
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,680
Tony's face is white.

812
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,640
"How do you know that, Trish?" he asks.

813
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,680
"I heard them talking in the garden.

814
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
They didn't see me," she explains.

815
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,640
"What are we going to do now?" asks Stacy, afraid.

816
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,120
"I don't know yet," replies Ricki.

817
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,640
"Let's go back to the party before 
they notice we're not there.

818
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,080
Perhaps we can catch them 
out if they think we don't  

819
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,120
know anything."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

820
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,200
CHAPTER NINE

821
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,000
The Caper Mystery Is Solved

822
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's 1: 00 a.m.

823
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,440
and the party is finished.

824
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,880
The last guests leave and the 
four friends start clearing up.

825
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,520
"The party was a success," Tony 
is saying, "and so was our plan.

826
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,880
Now we know the driver of the car but 
the seniors don't think we know anything.

827
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,840
Trish, you're a good detective!

828
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,080
I'm going to call you Miss 
Marple!" They all laugh.

829
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,920
"Yes, you are like Agatha Christie's 
detective, Miss Marple!" jokes Ricki.

830
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,760
Trish smiles.

831
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,680
"Sorry, everyone," says Stacy with a serious face,  

832
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,400
"but in fact we don't know Eric is the driver, 
all we know for sure is that the red car is his.

833
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,960
Maybe another person drives it sometimes.

834
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
We need more information."

835
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,560
"And we need more proof to connect 
Eric with 'Caper'," adds Tony.

836
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,080
They sit in silence, thinking.

837
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,960
"There must be a clue in the e-mails that 
can lead us to the culprits," says Stacy.

838
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,320
"Caper.

839
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,760
C-A-P-E-R...

840
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,600
hmmm.

841
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,840
Eric Caplin.

842
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,200
But I where's the connection?" She 
writes the name "Eric Caplin" on a piece!

843
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,440
of paper and studies it.

844
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,120
Eric Caplin

845
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,600
Caplin Eric

846
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,040
E C C E

847
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,200
E Caplin Eric C Er Cap CapEr I

848
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,520
"Look!" she shouts suddenly, "Caper!"

849
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,360
Stacy shows them the paper.

850
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,880
"Look at Eric's name.

851
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,040
Eric Caplin.

852
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,000
Do you see the connection?"

853
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,240
"I don't see anything," says Tony, puzzled.

854
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,920
"Stacy, you're right!" shouts Ricki.

855
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,560
"Look, Tony, Trish, she's right!

856
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,720
'Caper' is Eric's user name on the computer.

857
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,280
He uses the initial parts of 
his name for his user name.

858
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,320
In this case the first three 
letters of his last name,  

859
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,880
and the first two letters of 
his first name: C-A-P-E-R.

860
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,600
Congratulations, Stacy!

861
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,640
You're too clever to go out with an idiot like me.

862
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,360
"Good work, Stacy!" says Trish, 
"Now, let's catch 'Caper'!"

863
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,240
"How, Trish?" asks Tony.

864
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,800
"We're going to send him an e-mail," she replies.

865
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,480
"But he mustn't know it's from us," says Ricki.

866
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,600
"Yes, you're right, but we can send the message  

867
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,400
from my dad's computer and use a 
false user name," replies Trish.

868
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,720
"He's going to think the message is from Pat!"

869
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,480
"How?" asks Stacy.

870
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,320
"We don't have Pat's password."

871
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,800
"We can trick Eric.

872
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,600
We can write to him with a new user name 
and tell him that it's Pat's new user name.

873
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,960
We can say that he has a new user name 
now because the old one isn't safe."

874
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,720
"What are we going to write 
in the message?" asks Tony.

875
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,640
"It's too late to write the 
message now," replies Trish.

876
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,720
"We have to think about it carefully.

877
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,880
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon at 
my house to prepare the message.

878
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,560
Tony, can you give Stacy and me a ride home?"

879
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,120
"Sure, I have my mom's car tonight.

880
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,640
It's parked outside.

881
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,400
Come on, girls, let's go.

882
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,600
Ricki, see you tomorrow."

883
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,840
"Okay, guys, bye.

884
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,760
See you," replies Ricki sleepily.

885
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,240
On the way home in Tony's car, Tony and 
the girls are talking about the party.

886
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,560
Tony comes to a red light and 
puts his foot on the brake.

887
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,840
But something is wrong.

888
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,440
The car doesn't stop.

889
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,040
Tony pushes and pushes on the 
brake pedal, but nothing happens.

890
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,760
"Tony!

891
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,440
Tony!

892
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,560
What are you doing?

893
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,400
Stop the car!" shouts Stacy.

894
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
"I can't!" cries Tony.

895
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,480
"The brakes aren't working!"

896
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,200
Another car is coming towards them very fast.

897
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,040
Tony turns the wheel hard to avoid the other car.

898
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,440
The girls see the black post of the 
traffic lights in front of them.

899
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,640
Stacy screams as the car smashes 
violently into the traffic lights.

900
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,400
They all fall from their seats.

901
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,640
A few minutes pass.

902
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
They sit immobilized with shock.

903
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,600
Trish recovers first and turns 
to look at her two friends.

904
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,640
Tony is slumped over the steering wheel.

905
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,560
He isn't moving.

906
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,720
His eyes are shut.

907
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,080
He looks very pale.

908
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,040
"Tony!" cries Trish.

909
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,560
"Oh my God!

910
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:36,960
Tony!

911
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:47,760
Tony!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

912
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,080
CHAPTER TEN

913
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,200
A Close Call

914
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,520
"Tony, Tony, are you all right?" 
repeats Trish, shaking him.

915
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,840
At first Tony doesn't react.

916
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,560
Then, slowly, he lifts his head.

917
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,680
"Trish?

918
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,280
What...

919
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,520
what happened?"

920
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,120
"We hit the traffic lights," says Stacy.

921
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,640
"Are you okay?"

922
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,880
"The brakes!" says Tony.

923
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
"The brakes don't work...

924
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,960
it's strange.

925
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,560
Oh, look at my mom's car!

926
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,200
It's a wreck!''

927
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,240
"Don't worry about that now, Tony.

928
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,080
Let's leave the car here and call a taxi.

929
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,120
We all need to go home and rest."

930
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,200
"Caper said I was next," says Tony, slowly.

931
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,080
"This situation is getting really dangerous.

932
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,720
I'm scared."

933
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,880
"Don't think about it now," says Stacy.

934
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,760
"Let's just go home."

935
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,680
The next day Tony, Ricki and Stacy 
arrive at Trish's house after lunch.

936
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,440
Trish is sitting at the computer.

937
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,600
She types a new user name and starts 
writing the message to Eric Caplin.

938
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:55,200
To: caper@whosemail.com

939

Subject: Change of user name

941
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:09,920
Eric,

942
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,200
It's P.

943
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,080
I have a new user name - the 
old one wasn't safe anymore.

944
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,880
We must be very careful.

945
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,080
No one must be able to 
connect us to the accidents.

946
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,800
C and A aren't going to do 
anything - they're too scared,  

947
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,960
they're ready to quit the team I think 
- but we need to cover our tracks.

948
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,160
Let's talk tomorrow after school.

949
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,520
Cool Guy.
 
 
 
 
 
 

950
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,480
"There," says Trish.

951
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,400
"Now let's see if Eric, or 'Caper,' 
replies and gives us some written proof."

952
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,920
She sends the e-mail.

953
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,840
The friends go to make some coffee.

954
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,400
When they come back there 
is a reply to their message.

955
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,680
It says:

Subject: Change of user name

959
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,200
Cool Guy,

960
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,240
Anderson and Caruso don't know anything.

961
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,680
No one can connect the accidents to us.

962
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,640
Quit worrying - no one can touch us.

963
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,000
See you tomorrow.

964
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,920
Caper
 
 
 
 
 
 

965
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,960
"That's it!" shouts Trish.

966
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,880
"We've got them!" She prints the 
message and puts it in her school hag.

967
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,200
"Tomorrow afternoon we can go and see Mr 
Stockton and tell him everything we know."

968
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,680
"But we still don't know exactly what Eric 
and Pat did, or who helped them," says Ricki.

969
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,920
"You're right, but Mr Stockton 
can investigate that," says Stacy.

970
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,640
"We don't want any more trouble."

971
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,240
The next morning Tony and 
Ricki are in the computer  

972
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,400
room at school working on a math’s problem.

973
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,520
Suddenly Pat, Kyle and Eric come into the room.

974
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,240
They close the door and Kyle puts a chair 
in front of it so no one can come in.

975
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,880
Tony is nervous.

976
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,560
"What do you want, Pat?" he asks.

977
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,840
"Don't move, Caruso!" says Eric sharply.

978
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,800
"Sit down.

979
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,720
Now!"

980
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,120
"You think you're really 
smart, you two, don't you?

981
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,360
Well, we're on to you," says Pat.

982
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,480
"I don't know what you're talking 
about," replies Ricki, defiantly.

983
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:21,040
"Now, Anderson, that's not very honest for a 
good little boy scout like you," sneers Eric.

984
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,640
"Yeah, a boy that's always 
top of the class and sucks  

985
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,640
up to Coach Bergman to get on the team!" adds Pat.

986
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,800
Eric shows them a print-out of their 
e-mail with the false user name.

987
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,000
"Kyle was at my house yesterday when I got this.

988
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,680
He went to play billiards with Pat.

989
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,760
He asked Pat about his new user 
name, but Pat didn't know anything."

990
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,600
Tony and Ricki say nothing.

991
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,480
They feel scared.

992
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,800
"I suppose now you want to go blab 
to old Stockton, eh, Anderson?

993
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,720
Well, we're going to teach you a lesson.

994
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,400
You have to understand we mean business."

995
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,200
Ricki stands up but Eric steps 
forward and pushes him to the ground.

996
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,760
He's very angry.

997
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,880
Ricki tries to get up but Eric pushes him again.

998
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,920
He pulls Ricki's hair and 
lifts his arm to punch him.

999
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,320
"Get off the basketball team, Anderson.

1000
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,360
I'm going to fix you!"

1001
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,200
Tony tries to catch Eric's arm, 
but Kyle and Pat hold him back.

1002
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,960
"Eric, don't!" he shouts.

1003
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,000
"That's not the way.

1004
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,320
Don't make any more trouble."

1005
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:26,560
"Shut up, Caruso, you're next!" shouts 
Eric.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1006
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,200
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1007
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,400
Return to the Team

1008
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,360
Suddenly they hear voices in the corridor outside.

1009
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,240
Ricki sees Stacy's face at 
the glass panel in the door.

1010
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,320
Someone tries to open the 
door from the other side.

1011
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,160
Kyle shouts to Pat to help him keep it shut.

1012
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,760
Eric is too angry to notice.

1013
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,120
He hits Ricki on the head.

1014
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,320
Ricki is on the floor.

1015
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,040
He can't get up because of his leg.

1016
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,600
Then he sees his crutches 
next to the computer table.

1017
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,360
If he can reach one of them...

1018
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,080
He grabs Eric's leg and pulls him down.

1019
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:07,560
Eric falls and, at that moment Ricki grabs 
the crutch and pins him down with it.

1020
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,720
The door opens with a crash and Mr Stockton and 
some of the senior boys burst into the room.

1021
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,520
"That's enough, boys!" he shouts.

1022
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,480
"Caplin, Martin, Jones - go 
to my office immediately.

1023
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
You're in serious trouble.

1024
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,560
The police are coming for you."

1025
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,360
Eric is furious.

1026
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,800
As the seniors lead him and the others away,  

1027
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,480
he shouts at Ricki and Tony, 
"I'm going to finish you!

1028
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,160
I'm going to break your other leg, 
Anderson - and yours too, Caruso!"

1029
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,520
Later the four friends are in the lunch room at 
school when Mr Stockton walks over to the table.

1030
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,640
He smiles at the four students.

1031
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,200
"Kyle, Pat and Eric are not going 
to be in school for a while.

1032
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,440
The police are investigating their part in Ricki's 
accident and the problems with Tony's mom's car.

1033
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,880
Kyle and Pat aren't going to 
play basketball this year.

1034
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,200
Coach says he doesn't want 
trouble-makers on the team."

1035
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,480
He turns to Ricki, "I see you don't have 
your crutches any more, Ricki," he adds.

1036
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,120
"When are you going to start 
basketball practice again?"

1037
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,640
"Well, the doctor says my leg is much better.

1038
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,480
I can start playing again 
next month," replies Ricki.

1039
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,080
"That's good, but take it easy - you don't 
want to hurt your leg again," says Mr Stockton.

1040
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,080
"Now, there's a newspaper reporter 
in my office who wants to talk you.

1041
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,720
He wants to do a story in the local 
newspaper about Eric and your accidents.

1042
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Come to my office in thirty minutes.

1043
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,040
Stacy, Trish - you two girls, too."

1044
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,840
Later in the afternoon, Ricki 
and Tony are in the locker room.

1045
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,920
Tony is getting ready for practice when 
Anthony comes in and talks to them.

1046
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,960
"Kyle Martin and Pat Jones are off the team.

1047
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Coach says I'm on the team!

1048
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,440
I'm going to play in the game on Friday night!"

1049
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,960
"That's great, Anthony - you're a good 
player, you deserve it," says Ricki, smiling.

1050
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,520
"I hope your leg gets better and you can start 
playing again soon, Ricki," replies Anthony.

1051
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,640
"We're going to be a fantastic team this year!"

1052
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,800
They walk out onto the basketball court.

1053
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,040
Ricki sits down to watch the practice session.

1054
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,400
He thinks, "Now all the trouble 
is finished, I just want to play  

1055
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:23,960
basketball!"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1056
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,200
CHAPTER TWELVE

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,480
Ricki's Long Shot

1058
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,960
Four weeks later the 
basketball championship starts.

1059
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,840
The boys from Howard High are in the gym 
practicing for their first game on Saturday.

1060
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,240
Ricki is back!

1061
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,760
It's his first practice since the accident.

1062
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,920
He wants Coach Bergman to 
choose him to play on Saturday.

1063
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,520
He tries to run fast but his leg hurts a bit.

1064
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,640
"Take it easy, Anderson!" shouts Coach Bergman.

1065
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,000
"Don't force your leg.

1066
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,520
We need you for the game on Saturday night!"

1067
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,080
Ricki is pleased.

1068
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,120
He is going to play in the game!

1069
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,000
He works hard during practice.

1070
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,320
He shoots well, he plays intelligently in  

1071
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,680
the practice game, he plays 
well with the other players.

1072
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,720
After practice, he and Tony walk to the showers.

1073
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,880
"You played great tonight, Ricki," says Tony.

1074
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,240
"If you play like that on Saturday, 
Redwood High doesn't have a chance!"

1075
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,840
Coach Bergman comes into the 
locker room to talk to Ricki.

1076
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,560
"Anderson," he says, "I think you're 
ready to play in a real match.

1077
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,320
I want you there on Saturday.

1078
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,680
You and Caruso are a great duo!"

1079
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,320
"Thanks, Coach, that's fantastic!" replies Ricki.

1080
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,000
"Oh, and Ricki, I'm sorry for 
what happened to you and Tony.

1081
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,080
Caplin and the others were really out of 
control but they're going to be punished.

1082
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,640
I hope now they understand 
their behavior was very wrong.

1083
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,200
You can't become a good basketball player by 
threatening other players or hurting them.

1084
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,960
You and Tony are not only better players 
but you're better sportsmen than they are."

1085
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,680
"Thanks, Coach," says Tony.

1086
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,440
"We're going to work hard.

1087
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,600
We appreciate that you chose us to be on the 
team, even if we're juniors," says Tony sincerely.

1088
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,720
"Okay, boys.

1089
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:16,960
Show me I was right - win the match against 
Redwood High on Saturday!" laughs Coach Bergman.

1090
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,360
It's Saturday night and the arena is full.

1091
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,760
There are a lot of people watching the game.

1092
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,320
The band is playing loud music and the 
cheerleaders are dancing with their pompoms.

1093
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,400
The two teams run onto the court.

1094
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,240
They practice shooting and throwing the ball.

1095
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,960
Then the buzzer sounds and the game begins.

1096
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,400
Coach Bergman calls his players into a group.

1097
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,560
"Well, guys, this is our first game of the year.

1098
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,960
Redwood has a good team.

1099
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,600
It's going to be a tough match.

1100
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,800
Do your best."

1101
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,120
All the players nod.

1102
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,440
They join hands in a circle 
and shout, "Go, go, go!

1103
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,520
Fly high, Howard Hawks!!!"

1104
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,320
The crowd jumps to its feet.

1105
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,360
Everyone is clapping and 
shouting, "Go Hawks!" Some  

1106
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,120
people wave flags with pictures of hawks on them.

1107
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,680
The team feels the energy of the crowd.

1108
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,440
They are excited and tense.

1109
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,160
They want to win.

1110
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,200
At half time, the score is 46-40 for Redwood.

1111
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,120
Both teams are playing very well.

1112
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,080
At the end of the second half 
the score is even at 63-63.

1113
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,800
There are only 15 seconds left.

1114
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,040
The crowd is wild with excitement.

1115
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,240
Coach Bergman calls a timeout.

1116
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,160
"Okay, boys.

1117
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,440
We only have one more shot.

1118
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,400
Anderson, do you want to take the shot?"

1119
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,480
"You bet, Coach," Ricki replies.

1120
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,000
"Okay, then.

1121
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,440
Do all of you remember the set-up?"

1122
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,160
"Yes, Coach," the players say.

1123
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,280
The buzzer sounds.

1124
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,720
They go back onto the court.

1125
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,400
Tony passes the ball to 
Anthony who throws it to Don.

1126
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,200
Don dodges two Redwood 
players and passes to Ricki.

1127
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,787
Ricki jumps, takes aim quickly 
and throws the ball at the basket.

1128
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:53,320
Is the shot too short?

1129
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,440
He's still a long way from the basket.

1130
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,600
It doesn't go in.

1131
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,080
Ricki's heart sinks but the 
referee is blowing his whistle.

1132
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,920
Ricki has two free shots!

1133
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,160
He goes to the free-throw line.

1134
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,600
He takes aim and shoots.

1135
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,480
The hall hits the basket but it doesn't go in.

1136
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,800
He misses the shot!

1137
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,800
"I have to make this second 
shot," he thinks to himself.

1138
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,160
"It's our last chance!"

1139
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,520
This is the longest shot of his life.

1140
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,720
He takes a deep breath, fixes his 
eye on the basket, and shoots.

1141
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,520
The hall goes around the edge of the basket twice.

1142
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:30,160
He thinks, "Go in, please go in!" 
Then, the ball drops - it's in!

1143
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,280
Ricki scores!

1144
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,080
The crowd goes crazy!

1145
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,220
The Hawks win the game by one point!

1146
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:40,880
The players carry Ricki on their shoulders 
around the arena and the crowd shouts and cheers.

1147
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,800
He sees his parents standing, 
waving to him - they are very proud.

1148
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,440
He sees Stacy jumping and 
cheering and Trish next to her.

1149
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,000
He knows that this is the 
happiest moment of his life.

1150
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,160
After all the difficulties 
he had before this game,  

1151
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:22,800
now he knows it was worth it - 
the day he played the long shot.
