1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,330
Netty Sargent and the House

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:11,460
Netty Sargent lived with her uncle in that
lonely house just outside the grounds of the

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,610
squire's big house.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,360
She was a tall young woman, with black hair
and dancing eyes.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,000
And she had a little laughing smile that sent
all the young men wild.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,110
All the young men of that time were after
her, but in the end she decided that Jasper

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,280
Cliff was her favourite.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,410
He was good-looking, but he only ever thought
about himself, not other people.

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,000
But Netty wanted Jasper, and none of the others.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Jasper liked Netty too, but he was more interested
in her uncle's house.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,750
The house was built by Netty's great-great-grandfather,
and had a garden and a little field next to

12
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
it.

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,600
But it was a leasehold house, because the
ground belonged to the squire.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,000
'And what happens,' Jasper asked Netty one
day,' when your uncle dies?'

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,150
'The house, garden and field will go back
to the squire,' said Netty.'

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,320
But if Uncle pays a few pounds, he can renew
the leasehold and put another name on it.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,759
Then the squire can't get the house back until
that person dies.'

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,570
'And what is your uncle going to do?' asked
Jasper.

19
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,100
'Oh, he' s going to renew the leasehold, and
put my name on it.

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,450
He told me that months ago.'

21
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,850
Netty's uncle knew that it was important to
renew the leasehold, because the squire was

22
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,790
very anxious to get the house back.

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:03,469
The squire didn't like all those little leaseholds
on his ground, and he wanted to pull the house

24
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:08,539
down and make it all nice and tidy.

25
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,860
Netty's uncle knew this very well - but he
still didn't renew the leasehold.

26
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:22,200
He didn't like Jasper Cliff, so perhaps he
didn't like to think of Jasper marrying Netty

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,319
and living in the house when he was dead.

28
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:33,670
Every week Jasper asked Netty about the leasehold,
and Netty asked her uncle, and her uncle said,

29
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,760
'I'll go and see the squire' s agent next
week.'

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,940
But still nothing happened.

31
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,720
At last old Mr Sargent fell ill, and Jasper
got tired of waiting.

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,739
'Why doesn't your uncle do it?' he asked Netty.

33
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:56,510
'I tell you, if you lose the house and ground,
I won't marry you.

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,500
And there's an end of it.'

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,370
Poor Netty hurried indoors to talk to her
uncle.

36
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,260
'Please do something, Uncle!'

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,370
she said.'

38
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,110
If I don't get the house, I won' t get a husband!'

39
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,500
'And you must have Jasper, must you, my dear?'

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,690
'Yes, Uncle, I must!'

41
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:27,549
Old Sargent didn't want to make Netty unhappy,
so he asked for a meeting with the squire's

42
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,549
agent.

43
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,670
The squire was very cross when he heard this.

44
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,700
He was hoping that old Sargent would die and
the leasehold would come to an end.

45
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,860
But he had to agree to renew the leasehold
if Sargent paid the money.

46
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,200
So the squire' s agent got the new papers
ready for old Sargent to sign.

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,450
By now Netty's uncle was really ill, and couldn't
leave the house.

48
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,239
The agent agreed to visit him.

49
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,379
'I'll come at five o'clock on Monday,' he
told Netty,' and Mr Sargent can pay the money

50
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,170
and sign the papers then.'

51
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,139
At three o' clock on that Monday Netty brought
her uncle a cup of tea.

52
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,990
When she came in the room, her uncle gave
a little cry and fell forward in his chair.

53
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,810
Netty ran to him, but he could not speak or
move.

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:35,240
And in a few minutes, she saw that his face
and hands were cold and white.

55
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,760
He was dead, stone-cold dead.

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,960
Netty was very unhappy.

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,580
'Why didn't he live two more hours?'

58
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
she thought.

59
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,410
'Now I've lost everything - house, garden,
field, and a home for myself and my lover.

60
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,080
What am I going to do now?'

61
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,039
Then, suddenly, she knew what she had to do.

62
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,210
It was a dark December afternoon, which was
very helpful for her.

63
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,120
First, she locked the front door.

64
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,910
Then she moved her uncle's table in front
of the fire.

65
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,590
Her uncle's body was still in his chair, which
was a big old chair on wheels.

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,500
So she pushed the chair, with her uncle in
it, to the table, putting the chair with its

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,250
back half-turned to the window.

68
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,110
On the table she put the large family Bible
open in front of him, and put his finger on

69
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,110
the page.

70
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,250
Then she opened his eyes a little, and put
his glasses on his nose.

71
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,140
When it got dark, she lit a candle and put
it on the table beside the Bible.

72
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,400
Then she unlocked the door, and sat down to
wait.

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,130
When she heard the agent's knock at five o'
clock, she hurried to the door.

74
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,300
'I' m sorry, sir,' she whispered, 'Uncle's
so ill tonight.

75
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,780
I'm afraid he can't see you.'

76
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,160
The agent was not very pleased.

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
'So I've come out all this way for nothing,
have I?'

78
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,639
'Oh, no, sir, I hope not,' said Netty.'

79
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,800
We can do the business about the leasehold,
can't we?'

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,470
'Of course not.

81
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,660
He must pay the money, and sign the leasehold
papers in front of me.

82
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,710
I have to be a witness.'

83
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,710
Netty looked worried.

84
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,419
'Uncle is so afraid of business things like
this.

85
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,630
His hands were shaking when I told him that
you were coming today.'

86
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,550
'Poor old man - I' m sorry for him,' said
the agent.

87
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,800
'But he must sign the papers, and I must be
a witness.'

88
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,539
'Yes, I understand that, sir,' said Netty.

89
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,699
She thought for a minute.'

90
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,419
You have to see him.

91
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,430
But can you still be a witness, sir, if he
doesn't see you?'

92
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,810
'How do you mean, girl?' said the agent.

93
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,050
'Come with me a minute,' she said.

94
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,150
She took him into the garden and round to
the window.

95
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,449
Inside, the agent could see, at the other
end of the room, the back and side of the

96
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:40,000
old man's head, and his arm.

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,879
He could see the glasses on his nose, and
the book and the candle on the table.

98
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,479
'He's reading his Bible, sir,' said Netty,
in her softest, sweetest voice.

99
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:57,210
'Yes, I see that,' said the agent.

100
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,680
'But nobody ever sees him in church, do they?'

101
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,550
'No, but he loves his Bible,' said Netty.

102
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:11,620
'I think he's sleeping a little at the moment,
but that' s not surprising in an old man,

103
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,120
who's so unwell.

104
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,100
Now, sir, can you stand here at the window
and watch him sign the papers?

105
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,380
Then he won't see you, and he won't be worried
and unhappy about it all.

106
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,040
Can you do that for him, sir?'

107
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,410
'Very well,' said the agent.

108
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,570
He took out a cigar, lit it, and began to
smoke.

109
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,650
'Have you got the money ready?'

110
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,269
'Yes,' said Netty.

111
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,330
'I'll bring it out.'

112
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,149
She hurried inside, and brought out the money.

113
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:52,830
The agent counted it, then gave Netty the
leasehold papers.

114
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,820
'Uncle's hand is very shaky now,' she said.

115
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,910
'And he' s so sleepy.

116
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,150
I don' t think he signs his name very well.'

117
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,730
'He doesn't have to have beautiful writing.

118
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,730
He just has to sign,' said the agent.

119
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,940
'Can I hold his hand, to help him?'

120
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,980
'Yes, hold his hand, girl - that'll be all
right.

121
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:26,360
'Netty went into the house, and the agent
went on smoking his cigar outside the window.

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,450
He saw Netty put the pen and the papers in
front of her uncle, and touch his arm, and

123
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,070
speak to him.

124
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:43,700
She showed him where to write his name on
the papers, and put the pen in his hand.

125
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,000
Then she stood behind him, and held his hand.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,570
But the agent could still see a bit of his
head, and he saw the old man's hand write

127
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,840
his name on the papers.

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,810
Then Netty came out and gave the papers to
the agent, and the agent signed his name as

129
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,550
witness.

130
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,530
He gave her the paper signed by the squire,
and left.

131
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:18,709
And the next morning Netty told the neighbours
that her uncle was dead in his bed.

132
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:26,700
So that's how Netty Sargent lost her house
and field, and got them back again - with

133
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,630
a husband.

134
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,310
But Jasper was a mistake as a husband.

135
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:41,490
After a few years he started hitting Netty
- not very hard, but it made her angry.

136
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,950
Then she told a neighbour about the leasehold
business, and the story got around.

137
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:53,770
By then the old squire was dead, and the squire's
son got to hear the story.

138
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:03,500
But Netty was a pretty young woman, and the
squire's son never did anything about it.

139
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
***

140
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,240
Soon the carrier's wagon came down the hill
into Longpuddle, and everybody got out and

141
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
went home.

142
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,920
John Lackland's son went to find a room at
the Dog and Fox.

143
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,130
He stayed in Longpuddle for a few days, walking
around, looking at things, and talking to

144
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,130
people.

145
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,360
Then he left, and no one saw him again.

146
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,089
'Where did he go?' the schoolteacher asked
Mrs Weedle in the post office one day.

147
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,370
'I don't know,' said Mrs Weedle.'

148

149
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,980
He just went.'

150
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:51,040

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,350
'He said he just wanted to see the place where
he was a child.

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:05,430

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:14,320
