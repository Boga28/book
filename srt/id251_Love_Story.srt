CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:10,620
Stupid and rich, clever and poor

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,289
What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old
girl who died?

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:21,740
You can say that she was beautiful and intelligent.

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,539
She loved Mozart and Bach and the Beatles.

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,250
And me.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,140
Once, when she told me that, I asked her who
came first.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,860
She answered, smiling, "Like in the ABC.'

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,610
I smiled too.

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,110
But now I wonder.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,090
Was she talking about my first name?

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,660
If she was, I came last, behind Mozart.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,680
Or did she mean my last name?

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,270
If she did, I came between Bach and the Beatles.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,950
But I still didn't come first.

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,830
That worries me terribly now.

17
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,570
You see, I always had to be Number One.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,160
Family pride, you see.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:28,170
In the autumn of my last year at Harvard University,
I studied a lot in the Radcliffe library.

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,250
The library was quiet, nobody knew me there,
and they had the books that I needed for my

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,490
studies.

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:43,439
The day before an examination, I went over
to the library desk to ask for a book.

23
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,460
Two girls were working there.

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,259
One was tall and sporty.

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,729
The other was quiet and wore glasses.

26
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,009
I chose her, and asked for my book.

27
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,409
She gave me an unfriendly look.

28
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,090
'Don't you have a library at Harvard?'

29
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,729
she asked.

30
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:10,110
'Radcliffe let us use their library,' I answered.

31
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,000
'Yes, Preppie, they do - but is it fair?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,550
Harvard has five million books.

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,630
We have a few thousand.'

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,610
Oh dear, I thought.

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,980
A clever Radcliffe girl.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,500
I can usually make girls like her feel very
small.

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,880
But I needed that damn book, so I had to be
polite.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,480
'Listen, I need that damn book.'

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
'Don't speak like that to a lady, Preppie.'

40
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,690
'Why are you so sure that I went to prep school?'

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,110
She took off her glasses.

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,959
'You look stupid and rich,' she said.

43
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,980
'You're wrong,' I said.

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,020
'I'm actually clever and poor.'

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,500
'Oh no, Preppie,' she said.

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,730
'I'm clever and poor.'

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,310
She was looking straight at me.

48
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:19,780
All right, she had pretty brown eyes; and
OK, perhaps I looked rich.

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,310
But I don't let anyone call me stupid.

50
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,980
'What makes you so clever?'

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
I asked.

52
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,110
'I'm not going to go for coffee with you,'
she said.

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,860
'Listen - I'm not going to ask you!'

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,400
'That', she said, 'is what makes you stupid.'

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,930
Let me explain why I took her for coffee.

56
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,239
I got the book that I wanted, didn't I?

57
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,069
And she couldn't leave the library until closing
time.

58
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:55,480
So I was able to study the book for a good
long time.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,630
I got an A in my exam the next day.

60
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:06,780
I gave the girl's legs an A too, when she
came out from behind the library desk.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,349
We went to a coffee shop and I ordered coffee
for both of us.

62
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,730
'I'm Jennifer Cavilleri,' she said.

63
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,829
'I'm American, but my family came from Italy.

64
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,829
I'm studying music'

65
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:23,360
'My name is Oliver,' I said.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,759
'Is that you're first or your last name?'

67
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,310
she asked.

68
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,860
'First.

69
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,090
My other name is Barrett.'

70
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,810
'Oh,' she said.

71
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,910
'Like Elizabeth Barrett the writer?'

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,289
'Yes,' I said.

73
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:41,530
'No relation.'

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,310
I was pleased that she hadn't said, 'Barrett,
like Barrett Hall?'

75
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,160
That Barrett is a relation of mine.

76
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,660
Barrett Hall is a large, unlovely building
at Harvard University.

77
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,360
My great grandfather gave it to Harvard long
ago, and I am deeply ashamed of it.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,230
She was silent.

79
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,920
She sat there, half-smiling at me.

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,000
I looked at her notebooks.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,830
'Sixteenth-century music?'

82
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,830
I said.

83
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,520
'That sounds difficult.'

84
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,700
'It's too difficult for you, Preppie,' she
said coldly.

85
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,220
Why was I letting her talk to me like this?

86
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,870
Didn't she read the university magazine?

87
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,410
Didn't she know who I was?

88
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,150
'Hey, don't you know who I am?'

89
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,150
'Yes,' she answered.

90
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,280
'You're the man who owns Barrett Hall.'

91
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
She didn't know who I was.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,880
'I don't own Barrett Hall,' I argued.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,419
'My great-grandfather gave it to Harvard,
that's all.'

94
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,949
'So that's why his not-so-great grandson could
get into Harvard so easily!'

95
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:05,100
I was angry now.

96
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,690
'Jenny, if I'm no good, why did you want me
to invite you for coffee?'

97
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,590
She looked straight into my eyes and smiled.

98
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,090
'I like your body!'

99
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,410
she said.

100
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,919
Every big winner has to be a good loser too.

101
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
Every good Harvard man knows that.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,940
But it's better if you can win.

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,750
And so, as I walked with Jenny to her dormitory,
I made my winning move.

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,770
'Listen, Friday night is the Dartmouth hockey
match?

105
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,770
'So?'

106
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,819
'So I'd like you to come.'

107
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,740
These Radcliffe girls, they really care about
sport.

108
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,740
'And why', she asked, 'should I come to a
stupid ice-hockey match?'

109
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,030
'Because I'm playing,' I answered.

110
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,919
There was a moment's silence.

111
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,259
I think I heard snow falling.

112
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,680
'For which team?'

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,729
she said.

114
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:20,569
By the second quarter of the game on Friday
night, we were winning 0:0.

115
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:26,120
That is, Davey Johnson and I were getting
ready to score a goal.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,500
The crowd were screaming for blood - or a
goal.

117
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,370
I always feel that it's my job to give them
both these things.

118
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,240
I didn't look up at Jenny once, but I hoped
she was watching me.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,590
I got the puck and started off across the
ice.

120
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,250
Davey Johnson was there on my left, but I
didn't pass the puck to him.

121
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,180
I wanted to score this goal myself.

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,650
But before I could shoot, two big Dartmouth
men were after me.

123
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,440
In a moment, we were hitting the puck and
each other as hard as we could.

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,139
'You!' said a voice suddenly.

125
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,080
'Two minutes in the penalty box.'

126
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,620
I looked up.

127
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,780
He was talking to me.

128
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,800
'What did I do?'

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,070
I asked.

130
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,330
'Don't argue.'

131
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:30,370
He called to the officials' desk: 'Number
seven, two minutes in the penalty box, for

132
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,770
fighting.'

133
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,260
Angrily I climbed into the penalty box.

134
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,120
'Why are you sitting here when all your friends
are playing?'

135
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,300
The voice was Jenny's.

136
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,830
I didn't answer.

137
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,360
'Come on, Harvard, get that puck!'

138
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
I shouted.

139
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,580
'What did you do wrong?'

140
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,770
Jenny asked.

141
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,860
'I tried too hard.'

142
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,640
Out there on the ice Harvard were playing
with only five men.

143
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,070
'Is that something to be ashamed of?'

144
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,820
'Jenny, please.

145
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,070
I'm thinking.'

146
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,570
'What about?'

147
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,010
'About those two Dartmouth men.

148
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,459
When I get back onto the ice, I'll break them
into little pieces.'

149
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:23,420
'Do you always fight when you play hockey?'

150
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,340
'I'll fight you, Jenny, if you don't keep
quiet.'

151
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,930
'I'm leaving.

152
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,220
Goodbye.'

153
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,440
I looked round, but she had gone.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,480
Just then, the bell rang.

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,930
My two-minute penalty had finished.

156
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,220
I jumped onto the ice again.

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,970
'Good old Barrett!'

158
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,029
shouted the crowd.

159
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,740
Jenny will hear them shouting for me, I thought.

160
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,480
But where was she?

161
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,950
Had she left?

162
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,840
As I went for the puck, I looked up into the
crowd.

163
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,339
Jenny was standing there.

164
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,420
I took the puck and went towards the goal
line.

165
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,700
Two Dartmouth players were coming straight
at me.

166
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,190
'Go, Oliver, go!

167
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,500
Knock their heads off!'

168
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,350
That was Jenny's voice above the crowd.

169
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,570
It was crazily, beautifully violent.

170
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,820
I pushed past one Dartmouth man.

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,240
I knocked hard into the other.

172
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,529
Then I passed the puck to Davey Johnson, and
he banged it into the Dartmouth goal.

173
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,260
The crowd went wild.

174
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,490
In a moment we were all shouting and kissing
and banging each other on the back.

175
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,530
The crowd were screaming with excitement.

176
00:10:51,530 --> 00:11:00,320
After that, we murdered Dartmouth - seven
goals to zero.

177
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,750
After the match, I lay in the hot bath and
thought with pride about the game.

178
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,800
I'd scored one goal, and helped to score another.

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,950
Now the water felt wonderful on my tired body.

180
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,360
Ahhhh!

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,519
Suddenly I remembered Jenny.

182
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,139
Was she still waiting outside?

183
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:27,500
I hoped so!

184
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,769
I jumped out of that bath and dressed as fast
as I could.

185
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,500
Outside, the cold winter air hit me.

186
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,190
I looked round for Jenny.

187
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,170
Had she walked back to her dormitory alone?

188
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,370
Suddenly I saw her.

189
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,670
'Hey, Preppie, it's cold out here.'

190
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,130
I was really pleased to see her, and gave
her a quick kiss.

191
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,390
'Did I say you could kiss me?'

192
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,390
she said.

193
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,390
'Sorry.

194
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,339
I was just excited.'

195
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,839
'I wasn't.'

196
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,510
It was dark and quiet, out there in the cold.

197
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,640
I kissed her again, more slowly.

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,720
When we reached her dormitory, I did not kiss
her goodnight.

199
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,120
'Listen, Jenny, perhaps I won't telephone
you for a few months.'

200
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,760
She was silent for a moment.

201
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,090
'Why?'

202
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,330
she asked at last.

203
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,560
'But perhaps I'll telephone you as soon as
I get back to my dorm.'

204
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,140
I turned and began to walk away.

205
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,440
'Damn Preppie!'

206
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,050
I heard her say.

207
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,870
I turned again.

208
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,649
From twenty feet away I scored another goal.

209
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,990
'You see, Jenny, that's the kind of thing
you say.

210
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,070
And when other people do it to you, you don't
like it.'

211
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,430
I wished I could see the look on her face.

212
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,579
But I couldn't look back.

213
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:17,899
My pride wouldn't let me.

214
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,610
When I returned to my dorm, Ray Stratton was
there.

215
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,560
He and I slept in the same room.

216
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,180
Ray was playing cards with some of his football-playing
friends.

217
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,030
'Hello, Ollie,' said Ray.

218
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,430
'How many goals did you score?'

219
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,570
'I scored one, and I made one,' I answered.

220
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,130
'With Cavilleri?'

221
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,079
'That's none of your business!'

222
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
I replied quickly.

223
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,130
'Who's Cavilleri?'

224
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,310
asked one of the footballers.

225
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,130
'Jenny Cavilleri.

226
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,380
Studies music.

227
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,320
Plays the piano with the Music Group.'

228
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,580
'What does she play with Barrett?'

229
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,870
Everyone laughed.

230
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,529
'Get lost!'

231
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,089
I said as I entered my room.

232
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,589
There I took off my shoes, lay back on my
bed and telephoned Jenny's dormitory.

233
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,199
'Hey, Jen...'

234
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,380
I said softly.

235
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,610
'Yes?'

236
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,930
'I think I'm in love with you.'

237
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,940
She was silent for a few moments.

238
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:36,070
Then she answered, very softly: 'Oliver, you're
crazy.'

239
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,660
I wasn't unhappy.

240
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,420
Or surprised.

241
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,000
CHAPTER TWO

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,360
Blood and stone

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,199
A few weeks later, I was hurt in the hockey
match at Cornell University.

244
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,149
My face was badly cut and the officials gave
me the penalty for starting the fight.

245
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:06,710
Five minutes!

246
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:13,620
I sat quietly in the penalty box while the
team manager cleaned the blood off my face.

247
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,149
I was ashamed to look out onto the ice.

248
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,209
But the shouts of the crowd told me everything.

249
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,230
Cornell scored a goal.

250
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,040
The score was 3-3 now.

251
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,949
Damn, I thought.

252
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:35,699
We're going to lose this match, because of
me.

253
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,889
Across the ice, among the crowd, I saw him.

254
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,220
My father.

255
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,079
Old Stony face.

256
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,029
He was looking straight at me.

257
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:57,110
'If the meeting finishes in time, I'll come
to Cornell and watch you play,' he had told

258
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,880
me on the phone.

259
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,810
And there he was, Oliver Barrett the Third.

260
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,769
What was he thinking about?

261
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,120
Who could say?

262
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,620
Why was he here?

263
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,930
Family pride, perhaps.

264
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,779
'Look at me.

265
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:25,250
I am a very busy, important man, but I have
come all the way to Cornell, just to watch

266
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,800
my son play in a hockey match.'

267
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,170
We lost six goals to three.

268
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,889
After the match the doctor put twelve stitches
in my face.

269
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:44,389
When I got to the changing-room, it was empty.

270
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:47,889
They don't want to talk to me, I thought.

271
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,870
I lost that match.

272
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,190
I felt very ashamed as I walked out into the
winter night.

273
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,699
'Come and have dinner, son,' said a voice.

274
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,380
It was Old Stony face.

275
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,799
At dinner, we had one of our non-conversations.

276
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,209
We spoke to each other, but didn't actually
say anything.

277
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:22,450
These non-conversations always started with
'How have you been, son?' and ended with 'Is

278
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,520
there anything I can do for you?'

279
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,660
'How have you been, son?'

280
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,200
my father began.

281
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,160
'Fine, sir.'

282
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,740
'Does your face hurt?'

283
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,669
'No, sir.'

284
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:38,570
(It hurt terribly.)

285
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,520
Next, Old Stony face talked about Playing
the Game.

286
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,289
'All right, son, you lost the match.'

287
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:52,370
(How clever of you to notice, Father.)

288
00:17:52,370 --> 00:18:00,290
'But after all, in sport, the important thing
is the playing, not the winning.'

289
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,120
Wonderful, I thought.

290
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,540
Father was chosen for the Olympic Games.

291
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:11,650
And now he says winning is not important!

292
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:18,870
I just looked down at my plate and said 'Yes,
sir, at the right times.'

293
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,150
Our non-conversation continued.

294
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,100
After playing the game, he discussed My Plans.

295
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,830
'Tell me, Oliver, has the Law School accepted
you yet?'

296
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,240
'Not yet, sir.'

297
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,800
'Would you like me to telephone them?'

298
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
'No!'

299
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,260
I said at once.

300
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,560
'I want to get a letter like other people,
sir.

301
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,740
Please.'

302
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,510
'Yes, of course.

303
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,040
Fine...

304
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,549
After all, they're sure to accept you."

305
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,679
Why?

306
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,929
I thought.

307
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,950
Because I'm clever and successful?

308
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,590
Or because I'm the son of Oliver Barrett the
Third?

309
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,020
The meal was as uninteresting as the conversation.

310
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,299
At last, my father spoke again.

311
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,010
'There's always the Peace Corps,' he said
suddenly.

312
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,570
'I think the Peace Corps is a fine thing,
don't you?'

313
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,490
'Oh, yes, sir,' I said politely.

314
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,380
I knew nothing about the Peace Corps.

315
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,770
'What do your friends at Harvard think about
the Peace Corps?' he asked.

316
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,510
'Do they feel that the Peace Corps is important
in our world today?'

317
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:49,070
'Yes, sir,' I said politely, just to please
him.

318
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,110
After dinner, I walked with him to his car.

319
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:58,120
'Is there anything I can do for you, son?'
he asked.

320
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,950
'No, thank you, sir.

321
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,080
Good night, sir.'

322
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,580
Our non-conversation was finished: he drove
away.

323
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:16,740
Yes, of course there are planes, but Oliver
Barrett the Third chose to drive.

324
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,150
My father likes to drive - fast.

325
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:30,780
And at that time of night, in an Aston Martin
DBS, you can go very fast indeed.

326
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,580
I went to telephone Jenny.

327
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,700
That was the only good part of the evening.

328
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,390
I told her about the fight.

329
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,390
She enjoyed that.

330
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,150
Her musical friends never got into fights.

331
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,799
'I hope you hit the man who hit you,' she
said.

332
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,480
'Oh, yes.'

333
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
'Good!

334
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,870
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to watch you.

335
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,680
Perhaps you'll hit somebody in the Yale match?'

336
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,049
I smiled.

337
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:05,900
Jenny really made me feel better.

338
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,330
Back at Harvard the next day, I called at
her dorm.

339
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,510
Jenny was talking to someone on the telephone
in the hall.

340
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,510
'Yes.

341
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Of course!

342
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,460
Oh yes, Phil.

343
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,500
I love you too.

344
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,570
Love and kisses.

345
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,570
Goodbye.'

346
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,120
Who was she talking to?

347
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:34,429
I had only been away forty-eight hours, and
she had found a new boyfriend!

348
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,980
Jenny did not seem ashamed.

349
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,279
She kissed me lightly on the unhurt side of
my face.

350
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,240
'Hey - you look terrible!'

351
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,470
'Twelve stitches, Jen.'

352
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,970
'Does the other man look worse than you?'

353
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,520
'Much worse.

354
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,159
I always make the other man look worse.'

355
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,890
We walked to my MG sports car.

356
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,600
'Who's Phil?'

357
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,700
I asked as carelessly as I could.

358
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,030
'My father.'

359
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,070
I could not believe that!

360
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,980
'You call your father Phil?'

361
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,260
'That's his name.

362
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,830
What do you call your father?'

363
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,429
'Sir.'

364
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,039
'He must be really proud of you.

365
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:23,640
You're a big hockey star - and you're always
successful in your exams.'

366
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,750
'You don't know anything, Jenny.

367
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,290
He was good at exams and sport, too.

368
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,029
He was in the Olympic Games.'

369
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,799
'My God!

370
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,169
Did he win?'

371
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,659
'No.'

372
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:45,570
(Actually, Old Stony face was sixth, which
makes me feel a little better.)

373
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,510
Jenny was silent for a moment.

374
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,090
'Why do you hate him so much?'

375
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,320
she asked at last.

376
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,529
'I'm Oliver Barrett the Fourth,' I answered.

377
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:01,890
'All Barrett's have to be successful.

378
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,070
And that means I have to be good at everything,
all the time.

379
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,340
I hate it.'

380
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,029
'Oh, I'm sure you do,' laughed Jenny.

381
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:15,840
'You hate doing well in your exams.

382
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,190
You hate being a hockey star...'

383
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,200
'But he expects it!'

384
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,210
I said.

385
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,659
'If I'm successful, he isn't excited, or surprised.

386
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:32,120
He was a big success, and he expects me to
be the same.'

387
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:40,610
I told her about our meal and our non-conversation
after the Cornell match, but she didn't understand

388
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,110
at all.

389
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,289
'You say your father is a busy man,' she said.

390
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:52,659
'But he found time to go all the way to Cornell
to watch you play.

391
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,669
How can you say these terrible things about
him, when he drove all that way, just to watch

392
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,400
your hockey match?

393
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,620
He loves you, Oliver - can't you understand?'

394
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,809
'Forget it, Jenny,' I said.

395
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,700
She was silent for a moment.

396
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,730
'I'm pleased you have problems with your father,'
she said at last.

397
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,159
'That means you aren't perfect.'

398
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,400
'Oh - you mean you are perfect?'

399
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,620
'Of course not, Preppie.

400
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,130
That's why I go out with you!'

401
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,980
Jenny loved to have the last word.

402
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,360
CHAPTER THREE

403
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,950
We belong together

404
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,270
I had not yet made love to Jenny.

405
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,960
In the three weeks we had been together, we
had held hands.

406
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,809
Sometimes we had kissed, but that was all.

407
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:04,210
Usually I moved much faster - ask the other
girls that I'd been out with!

408
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,770
But Jenny was special.

409
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:13,840
I felt different about her and I didn't know
what to say to her.

410
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,529
'You're going to fail your exams, Oliver.'

411
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:21,789
We were studying in my room one Sunday afternoon.

412
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,760
'Oliver, you'll fail your exams if you don't
do some work.'

413
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,990
'I am working.'

414
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,130
'No, you aren't.

415
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,380
You're looking at my legs.'

416
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,580
'Only once every chapter.'

417
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,200
'That book has very short chapters.'

418
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,240
'Listen, you aren't as good-looking as all
that!'

419
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,919
'I know, but you think I am, don't you?'

420
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,929
'Dammit, Jenny, how can I study when all the
time I want to make love to you?'

421
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,320
She closed her book softly and put it down.

422
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,780
She put her arms around me.

423
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,110
'Oliver, will you please make love to me?'

424
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,350
It all happened at once.

425
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:17,330
It was all so unhurried, soft and gentle.

426
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,669
And I was gentle too.

427
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,550
Was this the real Oliver Barrett the Fourth?

428
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:33,020
'Hey, Oliver, did I ever tell you that I love
you?' said Jenny finally.

429
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,340
'No, Jen.'

430
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,060
I kissed her neck.

431
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,880
'I love you very much, Oliver.'

432
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,399
I love Ray Stratton too.

433
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:55,539
He's not very clever, or a wonderful footballer,
but he was a good friend to me.

434
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,990
Where did he go to study when I was in our
room with Jenny?

435
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:05,929
Where did he sleep on those Saturdays when
Jenny and I spent the night together?

436
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,760
In the old days, I always told him all about
my girlfriends.

437
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,620
But I never told him about Jenny and me.

438
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,180
'My God, Barrett, are you two sleeping together
or not?' asked Ray.

439
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,350
'Raymond, please don't ask.'

440
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,600
'You spend every minute of your free time
with her.

441
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,570
It isn't natural...'

442
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,020
'Ray, when two adults are in love...'

443
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
'Love?

444
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
At your age?

445
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,779
My God, I worry about you, I really do.'

446
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:40,809
'Don't worry, Raymond, old friend.

447
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:44,860
We'll have that flat in New York one day.

448
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,529
Different girls every night...'

449
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:50,060
'Don't you tell me not to worry, Barrett.

450
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,690
That girl's got you, and I don't like it!'

451
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,350
That evening I went to hear Jenny play the
piano with the Music Group.

452
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,910
'You were wonderful,' I said afterwards.

453
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:10,240
'That shows what you know about music, Preppie.'

454
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,320
We walked along the river together.

455
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,850
'I played OK.

456
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,320
Not wonderful.

457
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,890
Not "Olympic Games".

458
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,190
Just OK.

459
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,370
OK?'

460
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:26,769
'OK - but you should always continue your
music'

461
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:27,769
'Of course I will.

462
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:33,150
I'm going to study with Nadia Boulanger, aren't
I?'

463
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,150
'Who?'

464
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,940
'Nadia Boulanger.

465
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,690
She's a famous music teacher in Paris.

466
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,649
I'm very lucky.

467
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:43,830
I won a scholarship, too.'

468
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,820
'Jennifer - you're going to Paris?'

469
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,040
'I've never seen Europe.

470
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,899
I'm really excited about it.'

471
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:55,480
I took her by the arms and pulled her towards
me.

472
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,500
'Hey - how long have you known this?'

473
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,450
Jenny looked down at her feet.

474
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,539
'Oliver, don't be stupid.

475
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,570
We can't do anything about it.

476
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,120
After we finish university, you'll go your
way and I'll go mine.

477
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
You'll go to law school -'

478
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,299
'Wait a minute!

479
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,880
What are you talking about?'

480
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,490
She looked into my eyes.

481
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,429
'Ollie, you're a rich Preppie.

482
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:30,299
Your old man owns a bank.

483
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,390
My father's a baker in Cranston, Rhode Island...
and I'm nobody.'

484
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,350
'What does that matter?

485
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,740
We're together now.

486
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,240
We're happy.'

487
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,230
'Ollie, don't be stupid,' she repeated.

488
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,980
'Harvard is full of all kinds of different
people.

489
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,910
You study together, you have fun together.

490
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,409
But afterwards you have to go back to where
you belong.'

491
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,429
'We belong together.

492
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,030
Don't leave me, Jenny.

493
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,030
Please.'

494
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,860
'What about my scholarship?

495
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,982
What about Paris?'

496
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:09,220
'What about our marriage?'

497
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,330
'Who said anything about marriage?' said Jenny
in surprise.

498
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,529
'Me.

499
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:19,049
I'm saying it now.'

500
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,909
'Why?'

501
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,020
I looked straight into her eyes.

502
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,570
'Because,' I said.

503
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,090
'Oh,' said Jenny.

504
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,250
'That's a very good reason.'

505
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,799
She took my arm and we walked along the river.

506
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:44,620
There was nothing more to say, really.

507
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,549
The next Sunday we drove to visit my parents
in Ipswich, Massachusetts.

508
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,490
Jenny said it was the right thing to do, and
of course, there was also the fact that Oliver

509
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,260
the Third paid for my studies at Harvard.

510
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,929
'Oh my God,' Jenny said when we drove up to
the house.

511
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:08,850
'I didn't expect this.

512
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,730
It's like a damn palace!'

513
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,399
'Please, Jen.

514
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:15,190
Everything will be fine.'

515
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,620
'For a nice all-American girl of good family,
perhaps.

516
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:26,210
Not for Jennifer Cavilleri, baker's daughter,
from Cranston, Rhode Island.'

517
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,809
Florence opened the door.

518
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,559
She has worked for the Barrett family for
many years.

519
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,929
She told us that my parents were waiting in
the library.

520
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:42,920
We followed her past a long line of pictures
of famous Barrett's and a glass case full

521
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,990
of silver and gold cups.

522
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,220
'They look just like real silver and gold,'
said Jenny.

523
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,540
'They don't give cups like those at the Cranston
Sports Club!'

524
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,010
'They are real silver and gold,' I answered.

525
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,690
'My God!

526
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,210
Are they yours?'

527
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,730
'No, my father's.'

528
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,760
'Do you have silver and gold cups too, Oliver?'

529
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
'Yes.'

530
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,440
'In a glass case, like these?'

531
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
'No.

532
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,860
Up in my room, under the bed.'

533
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,370
She gave me one of her good Jenny-looks.

534
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:27,370
'We'll go and look at them later, shall we?'

535
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,159
Before I could answer, we heard a voice.

536
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,190
'Ah, hello there.'

537
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,400
It was Old Stony face.

538
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,460
'Oh, hello, sir.

539
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
This is Jennifer -'

540
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,559
'Hello there.'

541
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,460
He shook her hand before I could say her full
name.

542
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,809
There was a smile on his usually rock-like
face.

543
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:52,400
'Do come in and meet Mrs Barrett...

544
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,460
My wife Alison.

545
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
This is Jennifer -'

546
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:05,039
'Calliveri,' I said - for the first and only
time, I got her damn name wrong!

547
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,159
'Cavilleri,' said Jenny politely.

548
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,799
Mother and Jenny shook hands.

549
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,200
All through dinner, Mother kept the polite
small talk going.

550
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,840
'So your people are from Cranston, Jennifer?'
said my mother.

551
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,080
'Mostly.

552
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,269
My mother came from Fall River.'

553
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:31,940
'The Barrett's have factories at Fall River,'
said Oliver the Third.

554
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,899
'Where they cheated their workers for centuries,'
said Oliver the Fourth.

555
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:42,600
'In the nineteenth century,' said Oliver the
Third.

556
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,650
'What about the plans to put automatic machines
in the factories?' said Oliver the Fourth.

557
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,399
'What about coffee?'

558
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,990
my mother said quickly.

559
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,070
We moved back into the library.

560
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,000
We sat there with nothing to say to each other.

561
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,850
So I started a new non-conversation.

562
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:12,619
'Tell me, Jennifer,' I said, 'what do you
think about the Peace Corps?'

563
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,810
She looked at me in surprise.

564
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,570
'Oh, have you told them, O.B.?' asked my mother.

565
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:26,669
'It isn't the time for that, my dear,' said
Oliver Barrett the Third, with an "Ask me,

566
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:27,669
ask me!"

567
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:28,669
look on his face.

568
00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:31,240
'What's this, Father?'

569
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,950
I asked just to please him.

570
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,589
'Nothing important, son.'

571
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:42,000
'I don't know ho0w you can say that,' said
my mother.

572
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,500
She turned to me.

573
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,339
'Your father is going to be Head of the Peace
Corps.'

574
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:51,200
'Oh,' I said.

575
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,320
'Oh!' said Jenny in a different, happier kind
of voice.

576
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,640
'Well done, Mr Barrett.'

577
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,180
She gave me a hard look.

578
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,310
'Yes.

579
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:12,270
Well done, sir,' I said at last.

580
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,010
CHAPTER FOUR

581
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,750
Two different kinds of father

582
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:25,369
'Jenny he isn't going to be President of the
USA, after all!'

583
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,829
We were driving back to Harvard.

584
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:31,020
'You still weren't very nice to him about
it, Oliver.'

585
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,300
'I said, "Well done"!'

586
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
'Ha!

587
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,140
Oliver, why are you so unkind to your father?

588
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,119
You hurt him all the time.'

589
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,380
'It's impossible to hurt Oliver Barrett the
Third.'

590
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,619
'No, it isn't - if you marry Jennifer Cavilleri...

591
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,849
Oliver, I know you love me.

592
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:59,760
But in a strange way you want me because I'm
not a suitable woman for a Barrett to marry.

593
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,109
You are rebelling against your father.'

594
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:09,349
My father said the same thing a few days later
when we had lunch together at the Harvard

595
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:11,870
Club in Boston.

596
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:16,020
'Son, you're in too much of a hurry.

597
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,630
The young lady herself is fine.

598
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,180
The problem is you.

599
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,099
You are rebelling, and you know it.'

600
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,180
'Father, what worries you most about her?

601
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,339
That she's Italian?

602
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:30,390
Or that she's poor?'

603
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,950
'What do you like most about her?'

604
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,950
'I'm leaving.'

605
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,960
'Stay and talk like a man.'

606
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,240
I stayed.

607
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,819
Old Stony face liked that.

608
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,750
He's won again, I thought angrily.

609
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,770
'Wait a while, son,' Oliver Barrett the Third
continued.

610
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,040
'That's all I ask.

611
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,369
Finish law school.'

612
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:59,490
'Why do I have to wait?'

613
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,850
I was rebelling now.

614
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,700
'Oliver, you are still under twenty-one.

615
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,290
In the eyes of the law you are not yet an
adult.'

616
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,440
'Stop talking like a lawyer, dammit!'

617
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,460
'If you marry her now, you will get nothing
from me.'

618
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,280
'Father, you've got nothing that I want.'

619
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:29,619
I walked out of his club and out of his life.

620
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:34,900
After that, I was not looking forward to meeting
Jenny's father.

621
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,180
She was his only child and her mother was
dead.

622
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,800
She meant a lot to him...

623
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,630
I could see a lot of problems there.

624
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,630
And I was penniless.

625
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:53,819
How is Mr Cavilleri going to feel, I thought,
when he hears that young Barrett can't support

626
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,349
his daughter?

627
00:37:55,349 --> 00:38:03,380
Worse, she will have to work as a teacher
to support him while he is at law school!

628
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:10,040
As we drove down to Cranston on that Sunday
in May, I worried a lot about Mr Cavilleri's

629
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
feelings.

630
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,900
'Tell me again, Jen.'

631
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
'OK.

632
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,960
I telephoned him, and he said OK.'

633
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,770
'But what does he mean by "OK"?'

634
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:28,160
'Are you trying to tell me that Harvard Law
School has accepted a man who doesn't know

635
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
the meaning of "OK"?'

636
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,319
'It isn't a word that lawyers use much, Jen.

637
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:36,030
Just tell me again.

638
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,030
Please.'

639
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,600
'He knows you're poor, and he doesn't mind.

640
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,610
Stop worrying, Oliver.'

641
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,410
Jenny lived on Hamilton Street.

642
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:54,900
It was a long line of wooden houses with children
playing in front of them, and whole families

643
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,150
sitting on their front steps.

644
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:09,770
I felt like a stranger in a strange land as
I parked the MG outside 189A Hamilton Street.

645
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,800
Mr Cavilleri's handshake was warm and strong.

646
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,910
'How do you do, sir?'

647
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,910
I said.

648
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,400
'I'm Phil,' he said.

649
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,300
'Phil, sir.'

650
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,040
It was a frightening moment.

651
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,130
Then Mr Cavilleri turned to his daughter.

652
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:36,750
Suddenly they were in each other's arms, laughing
and crying and kissing.

653
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,370
I felt like a stranger.

654
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,890
For some time I did not have to speak much.

655
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:51,180
'Don't speak with your mouth full,' my family
had told me when I was a child.

656
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,320
Phil and his daughter kept my mouth full all
afternoon.

657
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,579
I don't know how many Italian cakes I ate.

658
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:03,640
Both Cavilleri's were very pleased.

659
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,280
'He's OK,' said Phil at last.

660
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,540
'I told you he was OK,' said his daughter.

661
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,119
'Well, I had to see for myself.

662
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,710
Now I've seen him.

663
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,710
Oliver -'

664
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,270
'Yes, sir?'

665
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,840
'Call me Phil.

666
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,550
You're OK.'

667
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,800
Later Phil tried to have a serious talk with
me.

668
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,150
He thought he could bring Oliver Barrett the
Third and Oliver Barrett the Fourth together

669
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,150
again.

670
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,640
'Let me speak to him on the telephone,' he
said.

671
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,609
'A father's love is a very special thing...'

672
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:47,810
'There isn't much of it in my family,' I said.

673
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,080
'Your father will soon realize,' he began.

674
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,770
'When it's time to go to the church -'

675
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:01,069
'Phil,' said Jenny gently, 'we don't want
to be married in church.'

676
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:08,260
He looked surprised, then unhappy.

677
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,060
But he spoke bravely.

678
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,819
'It's your wedding, children.

679
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:16,290
You choose.

680
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:21,349
It's OK by me.'

681
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:25,230
My next meeting was with the Head of Harvard
Law School.

682
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:31,730
'I'll need a scholarship for next year, sir,'
I said politely.

683
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,950
'A scholarship?

684
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,450
I don't understand.

685
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,450
Your father -'

686
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,630
'My father has nothing to do with it, sir.

687
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,619
We've had a disagreement, and he isn't supporting
me anymore.'

688
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,589
The Head took off his glasses, then put them
on again.

689
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:56,540
I continued, 'That's why I've come here to
see you, sir.

690
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,970
I'm getting married next month.

691
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,030
We're both going to work during the summer.

692
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,670
Then Jenny will support us by teaching.

693
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,730
But her teaching won't pay enough to send
me to law school.

694
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,850
Sir, I need a scholarship.

695
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,319
I have no money in the bank.'

696
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,910
'Mr Barrett, our scholarships are for poor
people.

697
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,760
And it's too late to ask for one.

698
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,980
I do not wish to enter into a family disagreement,
but I think you should go and talk to your

699
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,980
father again.'

700
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,810
'Oh no!'

701
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,280
I said angrily.

702
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:45,260
'I am not, repeat not, going back to my father
to ask for money!'

703
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,480
When Jenny graduated from university that
summer, all her relations came from Cranston

704
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,780
to watch.

705
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,381
We didn't tell them about our marriage plans
because we wanted a quiet wedding, and didn't

706
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:02,210
want to hurt their feelings.

707
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,400
I graduated from Harvard the next day.

708
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,640
Was Oliver the Third there in the university
hall?

709
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,349
I don't know.

710
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:16,630
I didn't look for Old Stony face in the crowd.

711
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:24,090
I gave my parents' tickets to Jenny and Phil,
but as an old Harvard man, my father could

712
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,460
sit with the Class of 26.

713
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,980
But why should he want to?

714
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,050
I mean, weren't the banks open that day?

715
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,250
The wedding was on the next Sunday.

716
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,890
It was very quiet and very beautiful.

717
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:48,210
Phil was there, of course, and my friend Ray
Stratton.

718
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,790
Jenny and I spoke about our love for each
other and promised to stay together until

719
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,370
death.

720
00:43:55,370 --> 00:44:04,160
Ray gave me the ring and soon Oliver Barrett
the Fourth and Jennifer Cavilleri were man

721
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,010
and wife.

722
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,559
We had a small party afterwards, just the
four of us.

723
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,880
Then Ray and Phil went home and Jenny and
I were alone together.

724
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,760
'Jenny, we're really married!'

725
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,990
'Yes.

726
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:29,540
Now I can be as terrible to you as I like!'

727
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,150
CHAPTER FIVE

728
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,230
The first three years

729
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:43,530
For three years, we had to make every dollar
do the work of two.

730
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,770
All through the summer holidays we worked
at the Boat Club in Dennis Port.

731
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:55,560
It was hard work, but we were never too tired
to be kind to each other.

732
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:04,740
I say 'kind' because there are no words to
describe our love and happiness together.

733
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,869
After the summer, we found a 'cheap' flat
near the university.

734
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:16,420
It was on the top floor of an old house and
was actually very expensive.

735
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,410
But what could we do?

736
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,740
There weren't many flats around.

737
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:25,330
'Hey, Preppie,' said Jenny when we arrived
there.

738
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,800
'Are you my husband or aren't you?'

739
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,740
'Of course I'm your husband.'

740
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,240
'Show me, then.'

741
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,380
(My God, I thought, in the street?)

742
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,880
'Carry me into our first home!'

743
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,030
I carried her up the five steps to the front
door.

744
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,260
'Why did you stop?'

745
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,260
she asked.

746
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,069
'This isn't our home.

747
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:53,410
Upstairs, Preppie!'

748
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:59,859
There were twenty-four stairs up to our flat,
and I had to stop halfway.

749
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:03,280
'Why are you so heavy?'

750
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,060
I asked her.

751
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,530
'Perhaps I'm expecting a baby.'

752
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,630
'My God!

753
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,630
Are you?'

754
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,630
'Ha!

755
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,069
I frightened you then, didn't I?'

756
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:18,620
'Well, yes, just for a second or two.'

757
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,910
I carried her the rest of the way.

758
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:28,150
There were very few moments in those days
when we were not worrying about money.

759
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,920
Very few, and very wonderful - and that moment
was one of them.

760
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:43,230
A food shop let us 'eat now, pay later', thanks
to the Barrett name.

761
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,690
But our famous name did not help us in Jenny's
work.

762
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,300
The Head of the school thought we were rich.

763
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,460
'Of course, we can't pay our teachers very
much,' said Miss Whitman.

764
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,180
'But that won't worry you, Mrs Barrett!'

765
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,869
Jenny tried to explain that Barrett's had
to eat, just like other people.

766
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:09,859
Miss Whitman just laughed politely.

767
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:13,560
'Don't worry,' Jenny said to me.

768
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,240
'We'll manage.

769
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,400
Just learn to like spaghetti.'

770
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,829
I did.

771
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:26,520
I learned to like spaghetti and Jenny learned
lots of different ways of cooking it.

772
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,859
With Jenny's pay from school, and our money
from our summer work and my holiday jobs,

773
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:34,910
we managed.

774
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:38,339
Our lives had changed a lot, of course.

775
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,079
There was no more music for Jenny.

776
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:46,400
She had to teach all day, and came home very
tired.

777
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,880
Then she had to cook dinner - restaurants
were too expensive for us.

778
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,490
There were a lot of films that we didn't see,
and places and people that we didn't visit.

779
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:03,550
But we were doing OK.

780
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,770
One day a beautiful invitation arrived.

781
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,040
It was for my father's sixtieth birthday party.

782
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,349
'Well?' said Jenny.

783
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:20,290
I was in the middle of a thick law book and
did not hear her at first.

784
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,569
'Oliver, he's reaching out to you.'

785
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,450
'No, he isn't.

786
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,530
My mother wrote it.

787
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,530
Now be quiet.

788
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,530
I'm studying.

789
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,100
I've got exams in three weeks.'

790
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,260
'Ollie, think.

791
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,460
Sixty years old, dammit.

792
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,950
How do you know that he'll still be alive
when you decide to forget your disagreement?'

793
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,800
'I don't know, and I don't care.

794
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,329
Now let me get on with my work!'

795
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:53,020
'One day,' said Jenny, 'when you're having
problems with Oliver the Fifth -'

796
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,990
'Our son won't be called Oliver, you can be
sure of that!'

797
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,510
I said angrily.

798
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,160
'You can call him Bozo if you like.

799
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:10,440
But that child will feel bad about you, because
you were a big Harvard sportsman.

800
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,660
And by the time he goes to university, you'll
probably be a big, important lawyer!'

801
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:24,670
She continued, 'Oliver, your father loves
you, in the same way as you will love Bozo.

802
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:32,140
But you Barrett's are so full of pride - you'll
go through life thinking that you hate each

803
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,730
other.

804
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,310
Now...

805
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:38,040
what about that invitation?'

806
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,490
'Write them a nice letter of refusal.'

807
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,859
'Oliver, I can't hurt your father like that...

808
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:49,640
What's their telephone number?'

809
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,950
I told her and was at once deep in my law
book again.

810
00:49:53,950 --> 00:50:01,359
I tried not to listen to her talking on the
telephone, but she was in the same room, after

811
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,660
all.

812
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:09,339
Suddenly I thought how long does it take to
say no?

813
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,270
'Ollie?'

814
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,920
Jenny had her hand over the telephone mouthpiece.

815
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,660
'Ollie, do we have to say no?'

816
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,560
'Yes, we do.

817
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,290
And hurry up, dammit!'

818
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:27,589
'I'm terribly sorry,' she said into the telephone.

819
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,980
She covered the mouthpiece again and turned
to me.

820
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,460
'He's very unhappy, Oliver!

821
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,060
Can you just sit there and let your father
bleed?'

822
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,220
'Stones don't bleed, Jen.

823
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,970
This isn't one of your warm, loving Italian
fathers.'

824
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,240
'Oliver, can't you just speak to him?'

825
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,660
'Speak to him!

826
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,339
Are you crazy?'

827
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,040
She held the telephone towards me.

828
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,080
She was trying not to cry.

829
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,300
'I will never speak to him.

830
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,380
Ever,' I said.

831
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,370
Now she was crying, very quietly.

832
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,710
Then she asked me once more.

833
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,869
'For me, Oliver.

834
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:16,810
I've never asked you for anything.

835
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,339
Please.'

836
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:22,390
I couldn't do it.

837
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,569
Didn't Jenny understand?

838
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:27,010
It was just impossible.

839
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:32,520
Unhappily, I shook my head.

840
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,380
Then Jenny spoke to me quietly and very angrily.

841
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:43,589
'You have no heart,' she said.

842
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:46,520
She spoke into the telephone again.

843
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,460
'Mr Barrett, Oliver wants you to know...'

844
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,930
She was crying, so it wasn't easy for her.

845
00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:04,290
'Oliver loves you very much,' she said, and
put the telephone down quickly.

846
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,550
I don't know why I did it.

847
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,800
Perhaps I went crazy for a moment.

848
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,580
Violently I took the telephone and threw it
across the room.

849
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,150
'Damn you, Jenny!

850
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,760
Why don't you get out of my life?'

851
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,410
I stood still for a second.

852
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:32,400
My God, I thought, what's happening to me?

853
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,540
I turned to look at Jenny.

854
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,540
But she had gone.

855
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,630
I looked round the flat for her.

856
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:48,810
Her coat was still there, but she had disappeared.

857
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:56,090
I ran out of the house and searched everywhere
for her: the law school library, Radcliffe,

858
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,160
the music school.

859
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,070
Was she in one of the music rooms?

860
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:05,710
I heard somebody playing the piano, loudly
and very badly.

861
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,930
Was it Jenny?

862
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,839
I pushed the door open.

863
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,530
A big Radcliffe girl was at the piano.

864
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,809
'What's the matter?'

865
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:17,190
she asked.

866
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:22,030
'Nothing,' I answered, and closed the door
again.

867
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,210
Where, oh where, had she gone?

868
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,700
I felt terrible.

869
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:34,350
I searched the university, the streets and
the cafes.

870
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,170
Nothing.

871
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,010
Had she taken a bus to Cranston, perhaps?

872
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:44,840
At midnight, I found a telephone box and called
Phil.

873
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,359
'Hello?' he said sleepily.

874
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,839
'What's the matter?

875
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,319
Is Jenny ill?'

876
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,150
My God, I thought, she isn't there!

877
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,760
'She's fine, Phil.

878
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,790
Uh - I just called to say hello.'

879
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,290
'You should call more often, dammit,' he said.

880
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:09,440
'Is Cranston so far away that you can't come
down on a Sunday afternoon?'

881
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,920
'We'll come, some Sunday, Phil, I promise.'

882
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:18,250
'Don't give me that - "some Sunday" indeed!

883
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,859
This Sunday, Oliver.'

884
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:21,460
'Yes, sir.

885
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,460
This Sunday.'

886
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:27,210
'And next time you telephone, I'll pay, dammit.

887
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,210
OK?'

888
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,420
He put down the telephone.

889
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,839
I stood there and wondered what to do.

890
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,480
At last, I went back to the flat.

891
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,490
Jenny was sitting on the top step.

892
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:47,309
I was too tired to cry, too glad to speak.

893
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:52,880
'I forgot my key,' said Jenny.

894
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,910
I stood there on the bottom step.

895
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,190
I was afraid to ask how long she had been
there.

896
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:05,369
I only knew that I had hurt her terribly.

897
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,530
'Jenny, I'm sorry -'

898
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,020
'Stop!'

899
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,780
she said.

900
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:20,760
Then she added, 'Love means you never have
to say you're sorry.'

901
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,900
We walked up to our flat.

902
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,780
As we undressed, she looked lovingly at me.

903
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:33,200
'I meant what I said, Oliver.'

904
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:39,349
And that was all.

905
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:42,280
CHAPTER SIX

906
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,230
Money can't buy everything

907
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,940
When the letter came from the Law School,
it changed our lives.

908
00:55:53,940 --> 00:56:00,880
I came third in the final examinations and
suddenly everyone wanted to offer me jobs.

909
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,450
It was a wonderful time.

910
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:12,109
Think of it: an all-American boy with a famous
name, third in his examinations and a Harvard

911
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:15,000
hockey player too.

912
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,319
Crowds of people were fighting to get my name
and number on their company writing paper.

913
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:27,170
At last, I accepted a job with Jonas and Marsh
in New York.

914
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,640
I was the highest-paid graduate of my year
too.

915
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:40,500
After three years of spaghetti and looking
twice at every dollar, it felt wonderful.

916
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,450
We moved to a beautiful flat in New York.

917
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:49,730
Jonas and Marsh's office was an easy ten-minute
walk away.

918
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,869
And there were lots of fashionable shops nearby
too.

919
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:59,220
I told my wife to get in there and start spending
immediately.

920
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,480
'Why, Oliver?'

921
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,329
'Woman, you supported me for three years.

922
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:07,960
Now it's my turn!'

923
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,549
I joined the Harvard Club of New York.

924
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:19,539
Ray Stratton was working in New York too and
we played tennis together three times a week.

925
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:26,109
My old Harvard friends discovered me once
more, and invitations arrived.

926
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,950
'Say no, Oliver.

927
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:33,780
I don't want to spend my free time with a
lot of empty-headed preppies.'

928
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,380
'OK, Jen, but what shall I tell them?'

929
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,309
'Tell them I'm expecting a baby.'

930
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:44,329
'Are you?'

931
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:45,400
She smiled.

932
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:53,150
'No, but if we stay at home tonight, perhaps
I will.'

933
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,880
We already had a name for our child.

934
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,289
'You know,' I said one evening.

935
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:02,640
'I really like the name Bozo.'

936
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,440
'You honestly want to call our child Bozo?'

937
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
'Yes.

938
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,600
It's the name of a big sports star.

939
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,680
He'll be wonderfully big and strong,' I continued.

940
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:24,520
'Bozo Barrett, Harvard's biggest football
star.'

941
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,010
We had a name for our child and we wanted
him very much.

942
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:37,180
But it's not always easy to make a baby, although
we tried very hard.

943
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:44,520
Finally I became worried and we went together
to see a doctor.

944
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,890
Doctor Sheppard checked everything carefully.

945
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,970
He took some of our blood and sent it away
for examination.

946
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:57,069
'We'll know soon,' he said.

947
00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:03,480
A few days later, he telephoned me at my office
and asked me to visit him on my way home that

948
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,480
evening.

949
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,610
'Well, Doctor,' I said, 'which of us has the
problem?'

950
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:14,560
'It's Jenny,' he said.

951
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,030
'She will never have children.'

952
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:24,500
I was ready for this news, but it still shook
me.

953
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:31,119
'Well,' I said, 'children aren't everything.'

954
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:39,390
'Oliver,' said Doctor Sheppard, 'the problem
is more serious than that.

955
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,550
Jenny is very ill.

956
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,319
She has a blood disease.

957
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:50,299
It is destroying her blood, and we can't stop
it.

958
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,270
She is dying, Oliver.

959
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,640
I am very sorry.'

960
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,809
'That's impossible, Doctor,' I said.

961
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:07,609
I waited for the doctor to tell me that it
was not true.

962
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:14,890
Kindly and patiently, he explained again,
and at last, I understood the terrible words.

963
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:19,190
'Have you spoken to Jenny, Doctor?

964
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,230
What did you tell her?'

965
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:25,799
'I told her that you were both all right.

966
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:28,960
For the moment it's better that way.'

967
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:35,770
I wanted to shout and scream at the unfairness
of it all.

968
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:40,890
Jenny was twenty-four, and she was dying.

969
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,650
'What can I do to help, Doctor?'

970
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,480
I asked at last.

971
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,530
'Just be natural,' he said.

972
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,640
'Natural!

973
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,030
I began to think about God.

974
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,930
At first, I hated Him.

975
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:09,060
Then next morning I woke up and Jenny was
there beside me.

976
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,130
Still there.

977
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:14,230
I was ashamed.

978
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,650
Thank you, God, I thought.

979
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:20,660
Thank you for letting me wake up and see Jennifer.

980
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:26,480
'Be natural,' the doctor had said.

981
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:34,240
I did my best, and all the time I was living
with my terrible secret.

982
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,980
One day Mr Jonas called me into his office.

983
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:41,589
'Oliver, I have an important job for you.

984
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:44,440
How soon can you go to Chicago?

985
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,430
You can take one of the younger men with you.'

986
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,330
One of the younger men?

987
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:53,940
I was the youngest man in the office.

988
01:01:53,940 --> 01:02:01,349
I understood the message: Oliver, although
you are still only twenty-four, you are one

989
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:03,030
of our top men.

990
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:10,950
'Thank you, sir,' I said, 'but I can't leave
New York just now.'

991
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:14,780
I had decided not to tell anyone about my
troubles.

992
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,090
I wanted to keep my secret as long as possible.

993
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:25,230
I could see that old man Jonas was unhappy
about my refusal.

994
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:34,450
On the way home that day I saw a notice in
a travel shop window: 'Fly to Paris!'

995
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:40,740
Suddenly I remembered Jenny's words: What
about my scholarship?

996
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:44,029
What about Paris?

997
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:50,069
I went into the shop and bought two tickets
to Paris.

998
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:54,559
Jenny was looking grey and tired when I got
home.

999
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,050
When I showed her the tickets, she shook her
head.

1000
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:06,440
'Oliver,' she said gently, 'I don't want Paris.

1001
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:14,420
I just want you... and I want time, which
you can't give me.'

1002
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:24,020
Now I looked in her eyes and saw the sadness
in them.

1003
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:29,010
We sat there silently, holding each other.

1004
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,940
Then Jenny explained.

1005
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,080
'I was feeling terrible.

1006
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,920
I went back to the doctor and he told me.

1007
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,809
I'm dying.'

1008
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:47,730
Now I didn't have to be 'natural' any more.

1009
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:51,289
We had no more secrets from each other.

1010
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:54,470
Now we could discuss things...

1011
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:59,609
things that young husbands and wives don't
usually have to discuss.

1012
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:03,880
'You must be strong, Oliver,' she said.

1013
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,420
'For Phil.

1014
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,069
It's going to be hard for him.

1015
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:11,779
He needs your help.

1016
01:04:11,779 --> 01:04:12,779
OK?'

1017
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:13,779
'OK.

1018
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:18,279
I'll be strong,' I promised.

1019
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:23,270
I hoped Jenny could not see how frightened
I was.

1020
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:30,970
A month later, just after dinner, Jenny was
playing Chopin on the piano.

1021
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,599
Suddenly she stopped.

1022
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,300
'Are you rich enough to pay for a taxi?'

1023
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,300
she asked.

1024
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,300
'Of course.

1025
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,029
Where do you want to go?'

1026
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:43,539
'To the hospital.'

1027
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:52,000
In the next few busy, worried moments, while
I hurriedly packed a bag, I realized.

1028
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,400
This is it, I thought.

1029
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,240
Jenny is going to walk out of this flat and
never come back.

1030
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,359
I wondered what she was thinking.

1031
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,510
She sat there, looking straight in front of
her.

1032
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:15,930
'Hey,' I said, 'is there anything special
that you want to take with you?'

1033
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:19,450
'No,' she said.

1034
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,240
Then she thought again.

1035
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,230
'Yes.

1036
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,230
You.'

1037
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:29,089
The taxi-driver thought Jenny was expecting
a baby.

1038
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:33,569
'Is this your first?' he asked.

1039
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:38,680
I was holding Jenny in my arms, and I felt
ready to explode.

1040
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,740
'Please, Ollie,' Jenny said to me softly.

1041
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,870
'He's trying to be nice to us.'

1042
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:50,560
'Yes,' I told the driver.

1043
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,710
'It's our first.

1044
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,390
And my wife isn't feeling very well.

1045
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:57,000
So can you hurry, please?'

1046
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,539
He got us to the hospital in ten minutes.

1047
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:05,539
'Good luck!' he called as he drove away.

1048
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:08,420
Jenny thanked him.

1049
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,660
She was having trouble walking.

1050
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,720
I wanted to carry her.

1051
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,059
But she said clearly, 'Not this time, Preppie.'

1052
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:20,340
So we walked.

1053
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,579
'Have you got health insurance?'

1054
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,849
they asked us in the hospital.

1055
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:30,010
'No.' we had never thought about buying insurance.

1056
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:35,020
We were too busy buying furniture and kitchen
things.

1057
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:39,950
Of course, the doctors knew about Jenny and
they were expecting us.

1058
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,849
'Listen,' I told them.

1059
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:43,349
'Do your best for Jenny.

1060
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:45,480
I don't care what it costs.

1061
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,280
I want her to have the best, please.

1062
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:53,660
I've got the money.'

1063
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,319
CHAPTER SEVEN

1064
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:01,630
Strongmen don't cry

1065
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:06,420
I jumped into my MG and drove through the
night to Boston.

1066
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:13,230
I changed my shirt in the car before I entered
the offices on State Street.

1067
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,690
It was only eight o'clock in the morning,
but several important-looking people were

1068
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:21,950
waiting to see Oliver Barrett the Third.

1069
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:27,539
His secretary recognized me and spoke my name
into the telephone.

1070
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:31,270
My father did not say 'Show him in'.

1071
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:36,540
Instead, the door opened and he came out to
meet me.

1072
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,670
'Oliver,' he said.

1073
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:45,369
His hair was a little greyer and his face
had lost some of its colour.

1074
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:49,260
'Come in, son,' he said.

1075
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:53,839
I walked into his office and sat down opposite
him.

1076
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:59,740
For a moment, we looked at each other.

1077
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:08,330
Then he looked away, and so did I. I looked
at the things on his desk: the scissors, the

1078
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:14,440
penholder, the letter-opener, the photos of
my mother and me.

1079
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,569
'How have you been, son?' he asked.

1080
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:21,319
'Very well, sir...

1081
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:24,569
Father, I need to borrow five thousand dollars.'

1082
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:28,779
He looked hard at me.

1083
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:34,290
'May I know the reason?' he said at last.

1084
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,520
'I can't tell you, Father.

1085
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,940
Just lend me the money.

1086
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,100
Please.'

1087
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,720
I felt that he didn't want to refuse, or argue
with me.

1088
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:53,909
He wanted to give me the money, but he also
wanted to... talk.

1089
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:56,270
'Don't they pay you at Jonas and Marsh?'

1090
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,290
'Yes, sir.'

1091
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:01,400
So he knows where I work, I thought.

1092
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,080
He probably knows how much they pay me too.

1093
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,560
'And doesn't Jennifer teach too?'

1094
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,710
Well, I thought, he doesn't know everything.

1095
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,670
'Please leave Jennifer out of this.

1096
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:16,670
Father.

1097
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,830
This is a personal matter.

1098
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,520
A very important personal matter.'

1099
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:27,130
'Have you got a girl into trouble?' he asked
quietly.

1100
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,940
'Yes,' I lied.

1101
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,120
'That's it.

1102
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,930
Now give me the money.

1103
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,020
Please.'

1104
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,500
I think he knew that I was lying.

1105
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:45,219
But I don't think he wanted to know my real
reason for wanting the money.

1106
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:52,350
He was asking because he wanted to... talk.

1107
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:56,580
He took out his chequebook and opened it slowly.

1108
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:02,080
Not to hurt me, I'm sure, but to give himself
time.

1109
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,900
Time to find things to say.

1110
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,739
Things that would not hurt the two of us.

1111
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:16,679
He finished writing the cheque, took it out
of the chequebook and held it out towards

1112
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,610
me.

1113
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:24,699
When I did not reach out my hand to take it,
he pulled back his hand and placed the cheque

1114
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:27,620
on his desk.

1115
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,120
He looked at me again.

1116
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,300
Here it is, son, the look on his face seemed
to say.

1117
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:41,440
But still he did not speak.

1118
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,680
I did not want to leave, either.

1119
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:49,520
But I couldn't think of anything painless
to say.

1120
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:55,960
And we couldn't sit there, wanting to talk
but unable to look at each other.

1121
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:02,600
I picked up the cheque and put it carefully
into my shirt pocket.

1122
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,969
I got up and went towards the door.

1123
01:11:05,969 --> 01:11:12,350
I wanted to thank my father for seeing me,
when several important people were waiting

1124
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:15,410
outside his office.

1125
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:24,290
If I want, I thought, he will send his visitors
away, just to be with me...

1126
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:31,170
I wanted to thank him for that, but the words
refused to come.

1127
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:38,390
I stood there with the door half open, and
at last, I managed to look at him and say:

1128
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:43,100
'Thank you, Father.'

1129
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:48,890
Then I had to tell Phil Cavilleri.

1130
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:51,560
He did not cry or say anything.

1131
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,080
He quietly closed his house in Cranston and
came to live in our flat.

1132
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:03,120
We all have ways of living with our troubles.

1133
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,909
Some people drink too much.

1134
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:11,440
Phil cleaned the flat, again and again.

1135
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,690
Perhaps he thought Jenny would come home again.

1136
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:17,560
Poor Phil.

1137
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,159
Next, I telephoned old man Jonas.

1138
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:25,010
I told him why I could not come into the office.

1139
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:31,160
I kept the conversation short because I knew
he was unhappy.

1140
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:36,670
He wanted to say things to me, but could not
find the words.

1141
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:40,940
I knew all about that.

1142
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,330
Phil and I lived for hospital visiting hours.

1143
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:53,810
The rest of life - eating and sleeping (or
not sleeping) - meant nothing to us.

1144
01:12:53,810 --> 01:13:03,830
One day, in the flat, I heard Phil saying,
very quietly, 'I can't take this much longer.'

1145
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:06,150
I did not answer him.

1146
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:10,190
I just thought to myself, I can take it.

1147
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:19,370
Dear God, I can take it as long as You want
- because Jenny is Jenny.

1148
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:25,390
That evening, she sent me out of her room.

1149
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:29,840
She wanted to speak to her father, 'man to
man'.

1150
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:36,480
'But don't go too far away,' she added.

1151
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,400
I went to sit outside.

1152
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,640
Then Phil appeared.

1153
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:46,810
'She wants to see you now,' he said.

1154
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:51,429
'Close the door,' Jenny ordered.

1155
01:13:51,429 --> 01:13:55,140
'I went to sit by her bed.'

1156
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:02,080
I always liked to sit beside her and look
at her face, because it had her eyes shining

1157
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,860
in it.

1158
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:09,820
'It doesn't hurt, Ollie, really,' she said.

1159
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:20,540
'It's like falling off a high building very
slowly - you know?'

1160
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,330
Something moved deep inside me.

1161
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:28,570
I am not going to cry, I said to myself.

1162
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,980
I'm strong, OK?

1163
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:34,670
And strong men don't cry...

1164
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:42,030
But if I'm not going to cry, then I can't
open my mouth.

1165
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:44,929
'Mm,' I said.

1166
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:52,180
'No, you don't know, Preppie,' she said.

1167
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:55,370
'You've never fallen off a high building in
your life.'

1168
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:59,380
'Yes, I have.'

1169
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,600
My voice came back.

1170
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,590
'I did when I met you.'

1171
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,179
She smiled.

1172
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:11,600
'Who cares about Paris?'

1173
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,040
she said suddenly.

1174
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:18,820
'Paris, music, all that.

1175
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,210
You think you stole it from me, don't you?

1176
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,220
I can see it in your face.

1177
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:30,500
Well, I don't care, you stupid Preppie.

1178
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,780
Can't you accept that?'

1179
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,590
'No,' I answered honestly.

1180
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:38,710
'Then get out of here!'

1181
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:39,710
she said angrily.

1182
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:42,650
'I don't want you at my damn death-bed.'

1183
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:47,710
'OK, I accept it,' I said.

1184
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,030
'That's better.

1185
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:57,490
Now - will you do something for me?'

1186
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:02,949
From somewhere inside me came this sudden,
violent need to cry.

1187
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:05,750
But I was strong.

1188
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,580
I was not going to cry.

1189
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:13,340
'Mm,' I said again.

1190
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:18,630
'Will you please hold me, Oliver?'

1191
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:30,330
I put my hand on her arm - oh God, she was
so thin - and held it.

1192
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:34,090
'No, Oliver,' she said.

1193
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,770
'Really hold me.

1194
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:41,520
Put your arms round me.'

1195
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:53,040
Very, very carefully I got onto the bed and
put my arms round her.

1196
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,150
'Thanks, Ollie.'

1197
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:07,260
Those were her last words.

1198
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:10,990
Phil Cavilleri was waiting outside.

1199
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,370
'Phil?'

1200
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,730
I said softly.

1201
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:21,850
He looked up and I think he already knew.

1202
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,380
I walked over and put my hand on his arm.

1203
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:31,000
'I won't cry,' he said quietly.

1204
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,570
'I'm going to be strong for you.

1205
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:37,080
I promised Jenny.'

1206
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:42,100
He touched my hand very gently.

1207
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,570
But I had to be alone.

1208
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:48,679
To feel the night air.

1209
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:52,220
To take a walk, perhaps.

1210
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:59,020
Downstairs, the entrance hall of the hospital
was very calm and quiet.

1211
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:04,050
The only noise was the sound of my footsteps
on the hard floor.

1212
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,400
'Oliver.'

1213
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:11,250
It was my father.

1214
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:17,540
Except for the woman at the desk, we were
all alone there.

1215
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,770
I could not speak to him.

1216
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,010
I went straight towards the door.

1217
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:27,739
But in a moment he was out there, standing
beside me.

1218
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:29,679
'Oliver,' he said.

1219
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,790
'Why didn't you tell me?'

1220
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:36,130
It was very cold.

1221
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:42,409
That was good, because I wanted to feel something.

1222
01:18:42,409 --> 01:18:48,850
My father continued to speak to me, while
I stood still and felt the cold wind on my

1223
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,120
face.

1224
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,870
'I heard this evening.

1225
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:56,730
I jumped into the car at once.'

1226
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,230
I was not wearing a coat.

1227
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,830
The cold was starting to make me ache.

1228
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:04,750
Good.

1229
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,660
Good.

1230
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:10,120
'Oliver,' said my father.

1231
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,540
'I want to help.'

1232
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:20,080
'Jenny's dead,' I told him.

1233
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:28,600
'I'm sorry,' he said very softly.

1234
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,990
I don't know why I did it.

1235
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:36,430
But I repeated Jenny's words from long ago.

1236
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:43,830
'Love means you never have to say you're sorry.'

1237
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:52,600
Then I did something, which I had never done
in front of him before.

1238
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:59,140
My father put his arms round me, and I cried.
