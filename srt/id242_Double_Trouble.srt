00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,590
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,470
Tavioka Island

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:11,090
Iveri sat at the back of the boat and steered
it slowly over the water.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,700
His day's work on Papaya Island was finished.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,869
If he went fast, Iveri could get home to Tavioka
Island in fifteen minutes.

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,900
But he wasn't in a hurry today.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,240
It was a warm and sunny afternoon.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,189
Iveri stopped the boat and turned off the
motor.

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,379
He threw the anchor into the water.

10
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:41,360
The anchor hit the sand below and the boat
rocked gently in one place.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,340
Iveri sat in the bottom of the boat and lay
back with his hands behind his head.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,540
Today was a special day for Iveri.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,450
It was the day a family from New Zealand was
coming to stay on Tavioka.

14
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,019
Iveri knew all about tourists.

15
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:04,650
He had started work at the Papaya Island Resort
when he left school.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:12,060
He took the tourists horse riding along the
beaches and into the centre of the island.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,170
Sometimes he and some other Fijian boys played
music in a band while the tourists at the

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,100
resort ate their dinner.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,200
When he finished work each day, he left the
tourists on Papaya.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,090
But today was different.

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,070
Now the first tourists were going to stay
on Tavioka.

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,750
They were going to stay with Iveri's family.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,630
He wasn't very happy about that.

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,680
The boat rocked and Iveri's eyes closed.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,950
He was tired.

26
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,790
Then he remembered that his mother had told
him not to be late.

27
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,900
'The Robinsons have two children,' she'd said.

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,149
'Please be nice to them.'

29
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:03,040
Iveri sat up and pulled up the anchor.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,740
He started the boat's motor and steered towards
Tavioka again.

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:18,250
When Iveri got closer to home he saw two people
- girls on the beach near his village.

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
They weren't looking towards him.

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,620
He turned off the motor and let the boat drift
along the shore away from the young people.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,590
They still didn't notice him.

35
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,739
The girls had blond hair.

36
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,970
They both wore T-shirts and long shorts.

37
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,840
One was shouting at the other.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,310
The other one had her head down and was kicking
the sand with her toe.

39
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,909
Iveri thought, it's going to be an interesting
week!

40
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,840
The boat was drifting too far from shore.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
Iveri started the motor and steered closer.

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,140
The girls turned and looked at him as he came
into the shallow water.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,450
He dropped the anchor, climbed out of the
boat and walked towards them.

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,450
'Hello!

45
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,170
Bula!' he said.

46
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,090
Then he stopped and looked closely at the
girls.

47
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,330
The one in the red T-shirt who had been shouting
was a girl.

48
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,950
But the other one in the green T-shirt was
a boy.

49
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,250
Iveri smiled.

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,600
The boy's hair was almost as long as the girl's
hair.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,290
They were twins.

52
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,040
Michelle didn't like the way the tall Fijian
boy stared at her.

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Maybe he's never seen twins before, she thought.

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,200
'Bula to you,' she said, but she wasn't very
friendly.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,780
She wasn't feeling very happy.

56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,500
She hadn't wanted to come to Fiji.

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,340
'I've seen enough Pacific islands in my life!'

58
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,209
she'd said to her brother Peter before they
came.

59
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,209
'It's okay for you.

60
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,980
You do anything Mum wants.'

61
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,220
Michelle had wanted to go skiing in Europe.

62
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,069
She certainly didn't want to stay in a Fijian
village.

63
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,380
But their parents wanted a different holiday
this year.

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,330
'At least we could have gone to Papaya Island
Resort instead of this place,' Michelle had

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,370
said to Peter.

66
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,639
'There are lots of things to do there.'

67
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,890
Peter was quite happy to come to the village.

68
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,310
The family's holidays were usually too busy
for him.

69
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,420
Michelle asked Iveri, 'Do you live here?'

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,690
'Yes,' he replied.

71
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,979
'Tavioka is my home.'

72
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,030
He put out his hand to Michelle.

73
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,889
'My name is Iveri.

74
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,410
Your family is staying with mine.'

75
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,139
Michelle shook his hand.

76
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,419
'I'm Michelle Robinson,' she said.

77
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,139
She pointed at her brother.

78
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,139
'And that's Peter.'

79
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,910
Peter said, 'Hello!

80
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,470
Bula!'

81
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,400
Iveri shook his hand.

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,660
Michelle said, 'Our mother said your father
is the chief here.'

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,930
'Yes, I am the chief's son,' said Iveri.

84
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,010
'I must go home.

85
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,530
My mother wants me.'

86
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,270
He began to walk up the path from the beach.

87
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,100
Michelle and Peter walked with him.

88
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,920
Three small children with big smiles were
playing with a dog beside the path.

89
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,789
They called out, 'Bula!' to Iveri.

90
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:43,940
'So, if you're the chief's son, does that
mean you'll be chief one day?'

91
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,010
Michelle asked.

92
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,889
'Oh no, I'll never be chief.

93
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,150
My father has brothers and I am my father's
youngest son.

94
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,110
When my father dies, the clan will choose
another chief.

95
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,060
The clan won't choose me.'

96
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,560
Peter said, 'We met your mother.

97
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,280
She's very happy about our family coming to
Tavioka.'

98
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,660
'Yes, she is,' said Iveri.

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,639
'My mother works at the resort over on Papaya.

100
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,710
She likes tourists.'

101
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:27,200
Maybe she won't like tourists after living
with Michelle for a week, thought Peter.

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,780
CHAPTER TWO

103
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,069
A village welcome

104
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,660
They were at the village now.

105
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,280
It was quite small.

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,039
Most houses were made of cement and painted
bright colours like blue, green or pink.

107
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,730
More children looked out of windows and doors
at them.

108
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,389
'Bula!'

109
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,789
Women sat in doorways and said, 'Bula!'

110
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,460
when they passed.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,360
Michelle and Peter had already seen the house
they were going to sleep in.

112
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,290
It was a cement house next to Iveri's family
bure, a house made of wood and grass.

113
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,660
The Robinsons' house had two rooms.

114
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,310
One was for Tom and Nicola, the twins' parents,
and the other was for Michelle and Peter.

115
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,830
The rooms had beds and cupboards in them and
a chair or two.

116
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,910
The floors were covered with grass mats.

117
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,879
There was no electricity on Tavioka, so they
were going to use oil lamps at night.

118
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,120
Nicola told Michelle and Peter that it was
an adventure.

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,699
Michelle thought it wasn't her kind of adventure!

120
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:49,919
Tom and Nicola were standing with Iveri's
mother, Tema, on the rara, the village green

121
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
in the centre of the village.

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,129
Tema was a big woman.

123
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:58,789
She was wearing a long yellow dress with white
flowers on it.

124
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:04,319
Tema said, 'Iveri, I see you have met the
children.

125
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,370
Tom, Nicola, here is my youngest son, Iveri.'

126
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,789
Iveri shook hands with Tom and Nicola and
said, 'Nice to meet you.

127
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:16,789
Welcome.'

128
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,060
'We hope you like it here,' Tema said to the
Robinsons.

129
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,530
'There are a lot of things to see on Tavioka
- the beach, the reef, the river, the hills.

130
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,820
If you need anything, please ask.'

131
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,529
A noise made them all look around.

132
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:40,250
A man had begun to hit a wooden drum in the
centre of the rara.

133
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,950
Tema continued, 'Iveri, now it is time for
sevusevu.'

134
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,470
'Sevusevu?' said Michelle.

135
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,350
Peter said, 'The ceremony to welcome us to
the village.'

136
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,860
Everyone smiled at him.

137
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,130
Peter thinks he knows everything, Michelle
thought.

138
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,470
Mum thinks he can't do anything wrong.

139
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,720
The man kept hitting the drum.

140
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,870
People came from their houses.

141
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,960
Some women were carrying plates of food.

142
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,560
Tema said, 'We will all eat.

143
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,890
Our men have been working very hard.'

144
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,300
She pointed behind them.

145
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,070
'They are building a new church.

146
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,290
Our old church is too small.'

147
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,980
A small man with white hair came out of the
church.

148
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,200
He walked slowly.

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,779
His face was tired.

150
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,820
'Here is my husband, Ratu Loti,' said Tema.

151
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,390
'Ratu means "chief",' Peter explained quietly
to Michelle.

152
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,330
Ratu Loti shook everyone's hands.

153
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:59,050
Tom gave him a small paper bag and said, 'This
is a gift from us to you - kava powder.'

154
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,610
'Vinaka,' said the Ratu.

155
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,890
'Thank you.'

156
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:11,250
The women put mats on the grass and put the
plates of food on the mats.

157
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,230
The women and children and young people sat
down.

158
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,170
'You can sit with me,' Tema said to the Robinsons.

159
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,649
The men of the village sat together in a circle.

160
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,790
Ratu Loti began to speak.

161
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,290
He spoke in Fijian for a long time.

162
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,839
Other men spoke.

163
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,399
They were welcoming the Robinsons to Tavioka.

164
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,620
Then Tema said to Tom, 'You must speak now.'

165
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,279
Everyone looked at Tom.

166
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,889
He smiled and said, 'Thank you for welcoming
us to your village.

167
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,060
Nicola, Peter, Michelle and I are very happy
to be here on Tavioka Island.

168
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,630
We've been to a lot of places in the Pacific
- I do a lot of work in the islands with my

169
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:09,180
building company - but we've never really
seen the way people live outside the resorts.

170
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,290
I think we're going to enjoy staying here
and learning about your life.

171
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,700
We hope that Tema's homestay business will
help everyone here.'

172
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:26,120
One of the men opened the paper bag and put
the powder into a bowl.

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,380
Then he picked up a bucket, poured water from
the bucket into the bowl and mixed the water

174
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,690
with the powder.

175
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,530
'He is making kava,' Iveri said quietly to
Michelle and Peter.

176
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,730
The man took the bowl around the circle of
men.

177
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,600
He gave Ratu Loti a cup made from half a coconut.

178
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,000
Ratu Loti clapped once and then drank some
kava from the coconut cup.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,350
He passed the cup to the man next to him and
then clapped three times.

180
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,779
The bowl and cup went slowly around the circle
of men, then someone passed it to Tom.

181
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:15,100
He clapped, drank, passed it to Nicola, and
then clapped three times.

182
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
Nicola did the same.

183
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,720
Then Peter drank, and passed the cup to Michelle.

184
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,920
She looked at the kava in the cup.

185
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,510
It was brown.

186
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,140
'What's it like?'

187
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,090
Michelle quietly asked Peter before she drank.

188
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,630
'It's okay,' he said.

189
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,029
Michelle drank.

190
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,540
It had a taste like pepper.

191
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,110
Her tongue and mouth were burning.

192
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,900
Peter laughed.

193
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,910
Nicola said, 'Clap, Michelle!'

194
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,070
She put the cup down, clapped and got up from
the mat.

195
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,100
Nicola said, 'Michelle!'

196
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,329
but Michelle didn't stop.

197
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,829
'I need water to wash away that taste!'

198
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,700
she said.

199
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,810
Iveri watched Michelle run away from the ceremony.

200
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,079
'Where is your sister going?' he asked Peter.

201
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,459
Peter laughed.

202
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,550
'I don't think she likes kava.'

203
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,379
'Oh, well.

204
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,190
The food is good,' Iveri said.

205
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,180
He gave Peter some small cakes.

206
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,550
The boys talked a little about life in the
village and life in New Zealand.

207
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,270
Iveri was sixteen - a year older than the
twins.

208
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,920
'I wish I was still at school.

209
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,029
I left last year,' Iveri said.

210
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:43,120
'I really wanted to go to a good school in
Suva but we are a very poor village.

211
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,110
I had to leave school and get a job.'

212
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,640
After the meal Iveri said, 'I have to help
my uncle in his garden now.'

213
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,430
He said goodbye to Peter and went to look
for his uncle.

214
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,870
He was surprised that Uncle Vili hadn't been
at sevusevu.

215
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,480
Maybe he was late coming home from work on
Papaya Island.

216
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,250
Uncle Vili was a gardener at the resort.

217
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,380
Iveri went to his uncle's house.

218
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,579
Uncle Vili lived alone.

219
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,930
He wasn't there.

220
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,130
Iveri took a machete and a sack and walked
out of the village to the hills behind it.

221
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,370
The plantations, the villagers' gardens, were
there.

222
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,850
He cut bananas and coconuts down from trees
with the machete.

223
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,880
He dug tavioka and dalo from the ground.

224
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,250
He put everything in the sack and carried
it back to his uncle's.

225
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:50,149
When he got home, he found Uncle Vili, Tema
and Ratu Loti sitting together outside the

226
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,290
bure.

227
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,149
They were drinking tea.

228
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:57,110
'Uncle, I've been to your plantation.

229
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,550
I got some fruit and vegetables for you.

230
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,480
I put them in your kitchen,' said Iveri.

231
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,350
'I will bring you some later, Tema,' said
Uncle Vili.

232
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,830
'You will need a lot of food for these tourists.'

233
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,329
'Thank you,' Tema smiled.

234
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,600
'Eroni is bringing me some fish too.'

235
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,100
Eroni was one of Iveri's brothers.

236
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,770
He was a fisherman.

237
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,600
He and his wife and children lived close by.

238
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,889
'You work very hard already, Tema,' Uncle
Vili continued.

239
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,800
'These tourists will be too much work for
you.'

240
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,329
'I told her that too,' said Ratu Loti.

241
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:46,880
'We had to build new houses, a special toilet
and a new shower room.'

242
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,810
'Loti,' said Tema.

243
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,339
'The houses weren't new.

244
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,940
They were houses that belonged to our family
already.

245
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,230
We just made them better.'

246
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,089
Her face was sad.

247
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,630
They were the houses of Iveri's oldest brothers.

248
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:09,690
Aseri lived in Suva and Simoni lived in Australia,
playing rugby.

249
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,750
'And Simoni sent us money for the toilet and
shower.'

250
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,440
Uncle Vili shook his head.

251
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,510
'These people will be trouble.

252
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,920
They should stay in the resorts with the other
tourists.'

253
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,079
'The village will get all the money from the
homestay business,' said Tema.

254
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,899
'It will be good for all of us.'

255
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,000
Ratu Loti smiled at Tema.

256
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,670
'We will see, my dear.'

257
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,820
Tema told Iveri, 'Time for a wash.

258
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,699
Remember you're taking the Robinsons to the
meke on Papaya tonight.'

259
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,230
Iveri went to have a shower in the new shower
room.

260
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,550
It was nicer than washing in the water trough
behind the bure.

261
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,850
But there was someone already in the room.

262
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,449
He could hear a beautiful voice singing in
the shower.

263
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:07,819
Michelle or her mother, he thought.

264
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:14,120
He washed in the water trough then he saw
Peter come out of the shower room.

265
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,089
Peter looked at him uncertainly.

266
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,910
Iveri said, 'Good singing!'

267
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,809
Peter smiled and said, 'Thanks, Iveri.

268
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,520
I love music.

269
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,970
I'm really looking forward to the concert
tonight.'

270
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:35,049
'Yes, you'll enjoy the meke,' said Iveri.

271
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:41,180
After dinner, Iveri took the tourists to Papaya
Island Resort in Ratu Loti's boat.

272
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,510
Uncle Vili came too.

273
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,590
Uncle Vili sat with Tom and Nicola.

274
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,270
'You will like the resort,' he told them.

275
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,890
'There are many things to do there.'

276
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,110
There was singing and dancing at the meke.

277
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,610
A man played a wooden drum.

278
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,060
Iveri and his band played and sang.

279
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,530
Peter and his parents smiled and clapped.

280
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,750
Michelle didn't smile once.

281
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,650
After the meke, Iveri showed the family around
the resort.

282
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,610
It was a beautiful place with a lot of shops
and many things to do.

283
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,540
He heard Michelle say, 'I'd love to stay here.

284
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,510
It's nicer than the village.'

285
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,070
Nicola said, 'Sh!' angrily.

286
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,530
It was time to go back to Tavioka.

287
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,409
The Robinsons waited on the wharf while Iveri
looked for his uncle.

288
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:47,090
He found Uncle Vili sitting with two men outside
a bure in the resort.

289
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,539
They were drinking kava.

290
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:52,409
One of the men was a tall thin tourist.

291
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:58,350
He was bald and was wearing a red shirt with
white flowers on it and blue shorts.

292
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,300
His legs were white and hairy.

293
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,390
The other man was a Fijian called Sami.

294
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,120
Iveri said, 'Bula!' to the men.

295
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,910
'We are ready to return to Tavioka, Uncle.'

296
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,760
'Go without me, Iveri.

297
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,150
I will stay on Papaya tonight.'

298
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,480
Iveri walked away.

299
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,630
He was surprised to see Sami there.

300
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,970
Sami was a bad person.

301
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:33,190
He had once lived on Tavioka but the Ratu
had made him leave the island.

302
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,110
He had gone to Suva and got into trouble there.

303
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,910
What was Sami doing on Papaya?

304
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:47,169
And why was he drinking with Uncle Vili?

305
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,020
CHAPTER THREE

306
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,150
Nothing happens on Sunday

307
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:03,260
After breakfast, the Robinsons went to church
with Ratu Loti, Tema and Iveri.

308
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,910
They wore their best clothes.

309
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,420
Michelle wore her new silver flip-flops.

310
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,800
They all had to leave their shoes at the church
door.

311
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,679
Peter loved the church.

312
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,150
He sang all the songs.

313
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,880
The words were Fijian, but that wasn't a problem
for Peter.

314
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,570
He just sang, 'La, la, la!'

315
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,330
The Fijians all turned to look at him.

316
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,289
Michelle wanted him to stop.

317
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:32,940
She kicked him.

318
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,549
When church was over Michelle hurried outside.

319
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,640
She looked for her flip-flops, but they were
gone.

320
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,870
'What's wrong, Michelle?'

321
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,350
Tom asked.

322
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,059
'I can't find my flip-flops.'

323
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,950
'You must be looking in the wrong place,'
he said.

324
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,010
'No, I'm not,' she said.

325
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,310
'I put them by the door.'

326
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,800
'That's strange,' said Tom.

327
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,490
Then he said, 'Hey, where are my shoes?'

328
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,220
He began to look among all the shoes.

329
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,090
'I can't see your mother's shoes, or Peter's.'

330
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,980
Tema came up and asked, 'What's wrong, Tom?'

331
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,130
'Michelle can't find her flip-flops and I
can't find my shoes.

332
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,190
Nicola's and Peter's shoes have gone too.'

333
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,680
Most of the villagers had taken their shoes.

334
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,049
There were only a few shoes and flip-flops
left outside the church.

335
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:33,610
'Somebody has taken our shoes,' said Michelle
angrily.

336
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,000
Tema said, 'Sorry!

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
It must be a mistake.'

338
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:42,029
'How can somebody take four pairs of shoes
by mistake?'

339
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,029
Michelle shouted.

340
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:46,770
Tom and Nicola both said, 'Michelle!'

341
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,740
and Peter said, 'Be quiet, Michelle.

342
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,980
Maybe someone needs shoes more than we need
them.'

343
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,570
Michelle marched off angrily and sat in her
room.

344
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,779
Why did we come to this silly village?

345
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:00,779
she thought.

346
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,760
I want to go and stay at the resort.

347
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,521
After lunch, Ratu Loti asked Iveri to take
the twins to the river.

348
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:16,610
'The river is a wonderful place,' he said.

349
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:25,130
'I am too old to swim now, but when I was
a young man I went there every day.'

350
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,350
Iveri wanted to visit friends.

351
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,299
But he was a good son and always did what
Ratu Loti asked him.

352
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,929
Michelle liked the idea.

353
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,950
Swimming was something she was good at.

354
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,620
She went to change her clothes.

355
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,500
'I'm not a very strong swimmer,' said Peter.

356
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,980
'That's okay, it's an easy place to swim,'
said Iveri, and Peter went to change too.

357
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:57,360
When the twins returned, Iveri said, 'Let's
go!'

358
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,520
The young people walked through the village
towards the plantations.

359
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,390
'I didn't know there was a river on Tavioka,'
said Peter.

360
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,470
'I thought you knew everything,' said Michelle.

361
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,110
'Shut up!' said Peter.

362
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,760
Iveri didn't want them to fight.

363
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,980
'It's only a small river,' he said.

364
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,170
They walked between thick fruit trees towards
the hills.

365
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,620
Then they came to the river.

366
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,240
Peter and Michelle followed Iveri across the
river where it was very shallow.

367
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,370
The water moved fast over the rocks.

368
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,650
One of Peter's flip-flops fell off and was
carried away by the river.

369
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,830
'Oh no,' said Peter.

370
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,990
'I'll have no shoes left!'

371
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,120
When they were across the river, Iveri led
them along the bank to a sandy area.

372
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,909
'The river is deep here and it moves fast,'
he said.

373
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:00,270
'If you jump in here you will drift a long
way.

374
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,340
It's fun!'

375
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,510
He jumped into the water.

376
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,669
The river carried him downstream, away from
the twins.

377
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,950
Michelle jumped straight in after him.

378
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,630
Peter sat on the bank with his legs in the
water.

379
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,580
Iveri and Michelle swam back up the river.

380
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,299
'Come on, Peter!' said Iveri.

381
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,890
Peter shook his head.

382
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,800
'I don't really like swimming in rivers or
the sea,' he said.

383
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,539
'I like to see the bottom.'

384
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:35,570
'Just get wet,' said Michelle.

385
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,330
Iveri watched as Peter slowly walked off the
bank and into the water.

386
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,010
He sat down and let the water cover him to
his neck.

387
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,779
'It's nice,' he said.

388
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:52,340
When Iveri and Michelle were tired, they sat
with Peter in the water.

389
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,140
'You two are very different,' said Iveri.

390
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,830
'You look the same but you're not like twins
at all!'

391
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,179
Michelle looked angry but Peter laughed.

392
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,270
'Did you think twins didn't fight?

393
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,840
We're just like any brother and sister, you
know.'

394
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
'Bula!'

395
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,270
called a voice behind them.

396
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,380
It was Uncle Vili.

397
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,169
He was carrying his machete and a sack over
his shoulder.

398
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:23,300
He smiled.

399
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,650
'It's nice to be a tourist,' he said to the
twins.

400
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,450
'No work.'

401
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,659
He walked past them.

402
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,809
Iveri showed Peter and Michelle that the riverbank
was made of clay.

403
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,909
'The women in the village make pots from it,'
he said.

404
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,750
'I know something you can do with clay,' said
Michelle.

405
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,130
She dug some clay out of the bank with her
fingers.

406
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,840
Then she put the clay on Peter's nose.

407
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,929
Iveri laughed at the look on Peter's face.

408
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,669
He stopped laughing when Michelle put clay
on his nose.

409
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,280
Then he took some clay and tried to catch
Michelle.

410
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,690
The three of them had a clay fight.

411
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,039
It was good fun, and they got clay all over
them.

412
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,950
Afterwards they washed it off in the water.

413
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:19,590
The sun was going down when Iveri took the
twins back to the village.

414
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,549
Michelle suddenly stopped.

415
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,920
She pointed at something on the path.

416
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,240
'What's that?'

417
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,309
she asked.

418
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:31,779
Iveri said, 'It's a toad.

419
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,360
They live near the river.'

420
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
'Yuck!

421
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
They're ugly,' said Michelle.

422
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
'Let's go!'

423
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,380
'Can we come here again, Iveri?'

424
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Peter asked.

425
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,280
'I have to work at Papaya Island Resort most
days,' Iveri said.

426
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,200
'But you two can come here any time.'

427
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,810
Michelle and Peter were tired and went to
bed early.

428
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,940
It was very dark on the island at night.

429
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,380
There was lamplight, but when the lights went
out there was only the light from the moon

430
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,990
and stars.

431
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,180
Peter woke when something fell onto his bed.

432
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,830
He put his hand out and touched it.

433
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,570
It was wet and moved.

434
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,110
He felt something else jump onto the bed.

435
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,370
He got out of bed quickly and looked for the
lamp.

436
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,559
Something moved near his foot.

437
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,360
He lit the lamp.

438
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,720
The room was full of big toads.

439
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,770
Their eyes stared at him.

440
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,080
A fat toad jumped onto Michelle's bed and
she woke up.

441
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,231
When she saw the toad on her bed, she began
to scream.

442
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:44,429
There were screams coming from Nicola and
Tom's room too.

443
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,320
That's Mum, Peter thought.

444
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,570
Then there was the sound of feet outside and
Iveri called, 'What's wrong?'

445
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,990
Peter stepped over the toads and opened the
door.

446
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,750
Iveri and Tema were there.

447
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
'Look!'

448
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
Peter said.

449
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,820
They looked inside.

450
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,840
Michelle stopped screaming.

451
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,769
'Where did the toads come from?'

452
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:09,769
Tema asked.

453
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:10,769
'Look.

454
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:14,510
Someone has cut the flyscreen,' Iveri said.

455
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,950
There was a big hole in the flyscreen.

456
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,010
A sack was lying in the corner of the room.

457
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,880
More toads were coming out of it.

458
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,429
Tom and Nicola came to the door.

459
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:30,200
'Tema, our room is full of toads,' said Tom.

460
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,920
Then he saw that Peter and Michelle's was
too.

461
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,470
Iveri and Peter went to look at the flyscreen
in Tom and Nicola's room.

462
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,050
It had been cut too.

463
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,470
'Who did this?'

464
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,080
Tema asked.

465
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,980
'Maybe someone in the village doesn't like
tourists,' said Tom.

466
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,990
'No!' said Tema.

467
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,450
'They are just toads.

468
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,510
We won't leave because of a few toads,' Nicola
said bravely.

469
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,510
Tema tried to smile.

470
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,990
Iveri said, 'Help me get the toads out of
the rooms, Peter.

471
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,600
They won't hurt you.'

472
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
First Peter took some photographs.

473
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,870
He wished he'd taken a picture of Michelle's
face!

474
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,120
It was fun getting the toads out of the rooms.

475
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,690
Peter chased them and Iveri caught them and
put them back in the sack.

476
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,289
'I'll take them to the river before work tomorrow,'
he said.

477
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,740
Peter and Michelle went back to bed but Michelle
made Peter keep the lamp on.

478
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:37,170
'I hope there aren't any snakes on Tavioka,'
she said.

479
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,090
CHAPTER FOUR

480
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,090
Out on the reef

481
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:50,049
Iveri took the toads away from the village
early in the morning and let them go near

482
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,070
the river.

483
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:57,610
When he arrived home, the Robinsons were eating
breakfast outside their house.

484
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,029
Ratu Loti was sitting with them.

485
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:05,700
'Uncle Vili will take your mother to work
on Papaya,' said the Ratu.

486
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,900
'This morning I want you to take our visitors
out in the new boat.

487
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,850
Show them the reef.'

488
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,840
'That will be fun,' said Tom.

489
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,530
Iveri heard Michelle say to Peter, 'How many
coral reefs have we looked at?

490
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,640
I'd rather dive on one!'

491
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,980
Iveri said, 'I can take you diving one day.'

492
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,929
Michelle smiled at him.

493
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:29,929
'Thanks.'

494
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,789
'Vinaka,' Peter said.

495
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,649
'That means, "thank you".'

496
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:37,600
Michelle gave Peter a hard push.

497
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,669
'You think you know everything,' she said.

498
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,059
She walked away from the boys.

499
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,549
Iveri shook his head.

500
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:48,279
He was glad she wasn't his sister!

501
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,890
Tema was ready for work.

502
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,460
She gave the Robinsons a basket of food to
eat on the boat.

503
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,570
'I will walk to the beach with you, Iveri.

504
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,130
Your Uncle Vili will be waiting to take me
to Papaya.'

505
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,830
Iveri led the way to the beach.

506
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,169
The 'new' boat was an old one Ratu Loti had
bought from Papaya Island Resort.

507
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,390
He and Iveri had painted it blue and white.

508
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,200
It was a special boat for looking at the coral
reef.

509
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,250
When you looked through the glass boxes in
the floor, you could see the reef under you.

510
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,350
Uncle Vili was waiting for Tema.

511
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,299
He helped her into his boat.

512
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:32,019
'Bula!' he said to the Robinsons with a big
smile.

513
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,940
'Where are you taking our friends today, Iveri?'

514
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,630
'To the reef near Papaya.'

515
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,659
'Show them the Tavioka reef too.

516
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:42,659
But be careful!

517
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,649
No more surprises for the Robinsons!' said
Uncle Vili.

518
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,510
He laughed.

519
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,450
Iveri thought, My mother must have told him
about the toads.

520
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,019
Uncle Vili started his boat's motor.

521
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:02,700
Tema waved to them as the boat moved off towards
Papaya Island.

522
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,510
Iveri helped the Robinsons into the boat.

523
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,860
It had long blue seats along each side and
a seat for Iveri in the back.

524
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,779
Tom and Michelle sat on one side and Nicola
and Peter sat on the other.

525
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:20,140
The two glass boxes were in the middle of
the boat.

526
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,570
There were wooden covers over the boxes.

527
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,070
Iveri started the motor and steered the boat
away from the shore.

528
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,750
Children on the beach waved to them.

529
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,000
It was a beautiful day.

530
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,120
The sun was hot.

531
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,909
Everyone wore hats.

532
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,480
Tom said, 'Where are the lifejackets, Iveri?'

533
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,990
Iveri said, 'We don't have any!'

534
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,380
Tom wasn't happy about that.

535
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,289
'You should have lifejackets.

536
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:51,850
We could have an accident.'

537
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,179
'I'll be very careful, Mr Robinson,' said
Iveri.

538
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:58,159
'And I will ask the Ratu to buy some lifejackets.

539
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,299
Perhaps we can get some from the resort.'

540
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,980
There were other boats out on the reef.

541
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,059
Most were from the resort.

542
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:10,490
The tourists from the resort went diving and
looked at the coral.

543
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,039
In some places, the reef was in shallow water.

544
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:18,400
Iveri had to be careful not to steer the boat
near those waters.

545
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,149
In other places, the reef lay down deep.

546
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:28,070
He steered through the reef for a while and
then he said, 'This is a good place.'

547
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,841
He turned off the motor and threw out the
anchor.

548
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:34,559
'Won't the anchor hurt the coral?'

549
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,900
Nicola asked.

550
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,910
'No,' said Iveri.

551
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,920
'I am careful.

552
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,360
The anchor is in the sand.'

553
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,110
Peter said, 'It's very deep out here.'

554
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:50,570
'You'll be okay,' said Tom.

555
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,139
Iveri took the wooden covers off the boxes.

556
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:56,110
'Look down!' he said.

557
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,200
'You'll see the coral and a lot of fish.'

558
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,380
The bright colours below them were amazing.

559
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
The coral was blue, pink and red.

560
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
'Wow!

561
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:12,250
Look at the blue starfish,' said Peter.

562
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,220
'I wish I was down there with the fish,' said
Michelle.

563
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,470
They drifted on the water and watched the
fish swimming through the coral reef.

564
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,599
Some were blue and others were yellow.

565
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,070
Some were black and white.

566
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,849
Nicola said, 'Some of the coral is brown,
Iveri.

567
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,940
Is it dead?'

568
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,280
Iveri told them that too many people dived
on the reef and that pollution from the resort

569
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,940
was killing the coral.

570
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,010
'There is no pollution on Tavioka,' he said.

571
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,000
'Shall I show you the reef there?'

572
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,340
'Okay,' said Nicola.

573
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:58,760
Iveri pulled up the anchor, started the motor
and steered towards Tavioka.

574
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,100
No one noticed a white boat begin to follow
Iveri's boat.

575
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,040
It was just another tourist boat out on the
reef.

576
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,090
They passed Iveri's brother Eroni, the fisherman
in his fishing boat.

577
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,619
He waved to them.

578
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,370
He was going home to Tavioka with a basket
full of fish.

579
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,540
'Fish for dinner,' said Iveri.

580
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,200
'Again,' said Michelle very quietly.

581
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,140
Then they were alone on the deep blue sea.

582
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,060
The boat was moving fast.

583
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,250
Iveri wanted to get to the reef and then home
again before he had to go to work at two o'clock.

584
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,330
Iveri heard the sound of another motor.

585
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,650
He looked behind him.

586
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,410
A white boat was coming quickly towards them.

587
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,680
Tom looked at the white boat and shouted,
'What's that fool doing?'

588
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,520
Nicola screamed, 'He's going to hit us!'

589
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,340
The white boat was almost on top of them.

590
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,849
Iveri saw the driver.

591
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:05,940
He was a Fijian and he was wearing sunglasses.

592
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,369
He steered right at them.

593
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,660
He wasn't going to stop.

594
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,640
Iveri tried to move out of the way but his
boat was heavy and slow.

595
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,450
The white boat hit them.

596
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,410
There was a loud noise and Iveri's boat rocked
wildly.

597
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,359
Peter was scared and tried to stand up.

598
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,440
'Sit down, Peter,' his father shouted.

599
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,950
The white boat had turned and was coming towards
them again.

600
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,839
'Peter, sit down!'

601
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,190
Nicola screamed.

602
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,300
The boat hit them for the second time.

603
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,569
Peter fell into the water.

604
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:42,090
The white boat circled their boat once, then
went off very fast.

605
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,930
Iveri stopped the motor.

606
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,500
Nicola was screaming.

607
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,370
She and Iveri stared over the side of the
boat.

608
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,040
There was no sign of Peter in the water.

609
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,950
Michelle dived into the water.

610
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,640
Tom followed her in.

611
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,100
Iveri didn't know what to do.

612
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,360
Should he go into the water too?

613
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,300
Or should he stay with Peter's mother?

614
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,119
He put his hand on Nicola's.

615
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,710
'Mrs Robinson, they will find Peter.'

616
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,349
'He'll drown,' cried Nicola.

617
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:10,319
'He'll be okay.'

618
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,470
Iveri hoped he was right.

619
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,970
Then they heard a shout.

620
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,120
It was Michelle.

621
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,870
'I've got him!'

622
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,980
she called.

623
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:24,270
Nicola and Iveri watched Michelle pull Peter
through the water, holding him under the arms.

624
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,980
Tom swam beside her.

625
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,220
'His eyes are closed!' said Nicola.

626
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,930
'He's okay!'

627
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,930
Tom called.

628
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,069
'His eyes are closed because he's scared.'

629
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:39,359
Tom got back into the boat and took Peter
from Michelle.

630
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,750
Nicola covered Peter's face with kisses.

631
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,740
Iveri helped Michelle back onto the boat.

632
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,730
'You are very brave,' he said.

633
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,410
Peter opened his eyes.

634
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,130
'Thanks, Michelle,' he said.

635
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,640
'I wish I could swim like you.

636
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,730
I wish I was brave like you.'

637
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,700
Michelle's face went red.

638
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,710
'You're okay, Peter.

639
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:08,060
I couldn't let you drown.'

640
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,450
Tom and Nicola told Michelle that she was
wonderful.

641
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:20,770
Iveri thought she was too.

642
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,770
CHAPTER FIVE

643
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,650
A strange meeting

644
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:30,930
There was a small hole in the side of the
boat but it was above the water level, and

645
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,670
the motor still worked.

646
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,680
The Robinsons were very quiet as Iveri took
them home.

647
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,770
Tom sat close to Michelle and Nicola held
Peter's hand.

648
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,430
Peter was still shaking.

649
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,800
Iveri was quiet too, but his thoughts were
very busy.

650
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,200
The man in the white boat had been wearing
sunglasses but Iveri knew him.

651
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,960
It was Sami.

652
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,569
Iveri heard Nicola say to her husband, 'Perhaps
we should leave Tavioka, Tom.

653
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:09,880
Too many strange things have happened and
Peter nearly drowned.'

654
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,359
Tom said, 'I think we'll have to tell the
police.

655
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,540
There may be a police station on Papaya.'

656
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,339
When they arrived at Tavioka, the Robinsons
walked to the village together.

657
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:25,619
Michelle turned and said, 'It'll be okay,
Iveri.'

658
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:31,170
Iveri tried to smile, but he was unhappy.

659
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,700
Poor Peter!

660
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,569
And he was worried about his mother.

661
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:41,480
Tema hoped a lot of tourists were going to
come to stay on Tavioka.

662
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,650
She didn't want to work in the resort.

663
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,220
She wanted to stay at home and look after
Ratu Loti.

664
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,950
Iveri looked for his father and found him
at the church.

665
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,089
He told him what had happened.

666
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:56,210
Ratu Loti shook his head.

667
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,280
'My son,' he said.

668
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,930
'This homestay business is a lot of trouble.

669
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,770
Tonight I will talk to your mother about it.

670
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:10,030
And I will send someone to look for Sami.

671
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,220
He must explain.'

672
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:20,450
When Iveri got back from work that evening,
he found Tema, Ratu Loti and Uncle Vili sitting

673
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,640
on the mats inside the bure.

674
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,450
'Where are the Robinsons?' he asked.

675
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:32,110
'They have already gone to their rooms,' said
the Ratu.

676
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,190
'The boy isn't very well.'

677
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,650
'I think they will leave soon,' said Tema.

678
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,200
Uncle Vili said, 'I told you tourists should
stay in resorts.

679
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,000
They should stay with other tourists.'

680
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,950
'But the only way for people to understand
Fijians is to live in a village,' said Tema.

681
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,640
'And their money will come right into the
village this way.'

682
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,980
Uncle Vili looked at Ratu Loti and said, 'I
have a better idea, Tema.

683
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,550
The resort developers are always looking for
land.

684
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,680
They want to build more resorts.

685
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,240
I think we should lease some land to a developer.

686
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,609
Maybe some land near Baka Bay.

687
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:19,470
We will get a lot of money.

688
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,970
Our people can work in the resort.

689
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,650
But we can keep the village for Fijians.'

690
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,560
Ratu Loti listened carefully to his brother.

691
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,650
'There are many things to think about,' he
said.

692
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,089
'First we will see what the Robinsons want
to do.

693
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:40,660
They were talking about going to the police
tomorrow.'

694
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:47,990
In Nicola and Tom's room, the Robinsons talked.

695
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,869
Nicola said, 'I really think we should leave.

696
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:52,310
It's not safe here.'

697
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,140
Peter was lying on his parents' bed.

698
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,550
'That's not fair!' he said.

699
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,079
'I love it here.

700
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:02,450
And it wasn't Iveri's fault that I fell in.'

701
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,980
Nicola said, 'I think we've learnt enough
about village life now.

702
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,570
We could go and stay in Papaya Island Resort.

703
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,070
Michelle liked it there - didn't you, Michelle?'

704
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,359
Michelle was quiet for a minute.

705
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,640
Then she said, 'Someone wants us to leave
here.

706
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,460
I don't think we should go.

707
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,040
Ratu Loti will find them soon.

708
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,840
Then things will be okay.'

709
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,790
Nicola said, 'I don't know.'

710
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:36,430
Tom said, 'Ratu Loti said he was going to
find the driver of the white boat.

711
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,170
Maybe we should give him a day to do that.'

712
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,730
Peter and Michelle went to their room.

713
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,110
'I thought you wanted to stay at the resort,'
said Peter.

714
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,720
'I did.

715
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,950
But I've changed my mind.

716
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,280
I like the people here.

717
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
I want Iveri to take me diving.

718
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,070
And I want to swim in the river again.'

719
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,180
'I don't think I want to go near water again
for a while,' said Peter.

720
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,300
'I was very scared.'

721
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,770
They lay in the dark, talking quietly.

722
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,740
They were friends again.

723
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,440
'I'm tired,' said Ratu Loti.

724
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,559
Uncle Vili went home, and Tema and the Ratu
went to bed.

725
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,589
Iveri stayed up.

726
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:29,250
He was thinking.

727
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,330
Why did Uncle Vili want the Ratu to lease
some Tavioka land to a developer?

728
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,770
Uncle Vili had never wanted any tourists to
come to the island.

729
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,280
Iveri needed to talk to his uncle.

730
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,230
His uncle hadn't really explained his reasons.

731
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,250
Why was a resort better than Tema's homestay
business?

732
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:57,710
The light from the moon was bright as Iveri
walked to his uncle's house.

733
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,150
The house was dark.

734
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,700
Iveri called out, 'Uncle!'

735
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,650
but there was no answer.

736
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,440
He went inside and called his uncle again.

737
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,110
His foot kicked against something on the floor.

738
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,110
He picked it up.

739
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,349
It was a small shoe.

740
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:22,180
He took it outside the house and looked at
it in the moonlight.

741
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,260
It was one of Michelle's silver flip-flops.

742
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:31,920
Had Uncle Vili taken the Robinsons' shoes?

743
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,000
Why?

744
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,010
Iveri thought hard.

745
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,160
Did Uncle Vili want to make trouble?

746
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,180
Was he trying to end the homestay business?

747
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,470
Iveri remembered that he had seen Uncle Vili
and Sami together at the resort.

748
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,030
Were they working together?

749
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,589
Iveri took the flip-flop home and hid it there.

750
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:58,480
Then he walked through the quiet village to
the beach.

751
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,950
He got into his own boat, pulled up the anchor
and began to row across the water.

752
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,050
He didn't want to start the motor yet.

753
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,510
It was a windy night and it was hard to row.

754
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:20,980
When his arms were tired, Iveri stopped rowing
and started the boat's motor.

755
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,030
On Papaya, he anchored the boat away from
the wharf.

756
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,859
He walked through the shallow water to the
shore.

757
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:32,940
He looked for the bure where he had seen Uncle
Vili on Saturday night.

758
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,030
He moved from bure to bure.

759
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,890
It was easy to see in the moonlight.

760
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,620
When he found the bure, there was a light
on inside.

761
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,359
He watched and waited.

762
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,940
The door opened and Iveri saw Uncle Vili come
outside.

763
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,280
The bald white man followed him.

764
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,020
The man shook Uncle Vili's hand and gave him
something.

765
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,850
Quickly and quietly, Iveri went closer.

766
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,920
He wanted to see what it was.

767
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,790
Uncle Vili had some small pieces of paper
in his hand.

768
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,510
Was it money?

769
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,970
The bald man called someone.

770
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,710
Sami appeared with a bag.

771
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,660
Uncle Vili began to put the paper into the
bag.

772
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,859
Then the wind blew and a piece of paper flew
into the air.

773
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:29,230
It was money.

774
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,329
Sami began to chase it at the same time as
Iveri ran forward out of the shadows to pick

775
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,070
it up.

776
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,460
Sami saw him and shouted, 'Stop!'

777
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,329
Iveri didn't look behind him.

778
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,910
He held the money in his hand and ran straight
for the beach.

779
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,970
He wished he was as fast as his brother Simoni,
the rugby player.

780
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:59,040
He heard feet coming fast behind him.

781
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
CHAPTER SIX

782
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,119
Night on the beach

783
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,359
Peter woke in the middle of the night.

784
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,599
The wind was loud outside and he could hear
a tree branch hitting the roof.

785
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,849
He sat up and said softly, 'Michelle?'

786
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:17,350
'Are you awake too?'

787
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,490
she asked.

788
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,520
'The wind woke me,' said Peter.

789
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,250
'What time is it?'

790
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,579
'Just after two.

791
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:28,990
I can't sleep,' said Michelle.

792
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,720
'I've been thinking about all the things that
have happened.

793
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,070
Someone doesn't want the homestay business
on Tavioka.

794
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:38,070
Who?'

795
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:41,869
'I don't know,' said Peter.

796
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:43,290
'But someone must have a reason.'

797
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,190
It was hot in the room.

798
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,349
Michelle said, 'Let's go for a walk.'

799
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:58,590
All the houses in the village were dark, but
the moonlight was bright.

800
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,369
There were a lot of coconuts on the ground
because of the wind.

801
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:05,340
The twins walked to the beach.

802
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,920
There were more coconuts there.

803
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,750
Peter picked one up.

804
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,990
It was heavy.

805
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,599
He rolled it along the hard wet sand.

806
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,160
Then Michelle picked up a coconut and rolled
it at Peter's.

807
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,650
It was fun.

808
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,859
Suddenly they heard a boat's motor out to
sea.

809
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:27,700
It was coming towards them fast.

810
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:34,640
In the shallow water, the driver threw out
the anchor and ran up onto the beach.

811
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,220
It was Iveri.

812
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,240
He said, 'What are you doing here?'

813
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,980
at the same time as Peter said, 'Hey, Iveri,
what's happening?'

814
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,089
'Someone's coming after me,' Iveri said.

815
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:48,930
'I'm going to hide behind the bushes.

816
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,329
Don't tell him where I am.'

817
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,510
He ran off.

818
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,260
They could hear another boat coming.

819
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,730
Iveri's footprints were clear in the moonlight.

820
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,690
Peter said to Michelle, 'Quick.

821
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,809
Let's roll coconuts over the footprints.'

822
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:06,380
So they took a coconut each and rolled them
on the sand.

823
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,570
They jumped all over the footprints too.

824
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,660
Soon no one could see where Iveri had been.

825
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,020
The second boat came quickly towards the beach.

826
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,800
The driver stopped his motor and jumped out
into the water.

827
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,380
He saw the twins on the beach and came up
to them.

828
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,960
It was a Fijian man.

829
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,720
He was tall and heavy and he wasn't smiling.

830
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,740
Peter stood next to Michelle.

831
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,210
He wanted to look after her.

832
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:39,790
The man pointed at Iveri's boat and said,
'Did you see a boy in that?'

833
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,540
'No,' Peter said.

834
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,380
'You're the first person we've seen.'

835
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,640
'I don't believe you,' said the man.

836
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,070
His face was angry.

837
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,369
'There's no boy here,' said Michelle.

838
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,950
'Are you hiding him?'

839
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,480
the man asked.

840
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,420
He came closer.

841
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,079
He put his big brown hand on Michelle's arm.

842
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,480
'If you are hiding him, I'll hurt you.'

843
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,400
'No, you won't,' said Peter and moved the
man's hand off Michelle's arm.

844
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,650
'I know you!

845
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,850
You're the man who tried to drown me.

846
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,520
I'll tell Ratu Loti.'

847
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,890
The man marched back to his boat.

848
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:27,100
He sat in it for a minute, then started the
motor and steered away.

849
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:32,800
When he was gone, Iveri came out from behind
the bushes.

850
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,859
'Vinaka!

851
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:38,089
Thank you!' he said.

852
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:41,730
Michelle said, 'Peter was very brave.

853
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,460
That was the man in the boat yesterday.'

854
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,910
'He's Sami,' said Iveri.

855
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,820
'Come back to my bure.

856
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,339
I have something to show you.'

857
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:55,040
They walked through the village.

858
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:01,580
When they got to Iveri's bure, he said, 'Wait!'
and went inside.

859
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,119
He came back out with something in his hand.

860
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,980
'Can we go to your room?' he asked them.

861
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,870
'But we must be quiet.'

862
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:16,280
Michelle lit the lamp inside their room.

863
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,120
Iveri showed them two things.

864
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,230
One was Michelle's silver flip-flop, and the
other was the money.

865
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,980
He told them the story of the night's adventures.

866
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,680
Michelle's eyes shone brightly in the lamplight.

867
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,750
'I think the bald man is a developer.

868
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:41,380
I think he's paying Uncle Vili to stop the
homestay business,' said Iveri.

869
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,430
'When are you going to tell the Ratu, Iveri?'

870
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,460
Peter asked.

871
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,460
Iveri shook his head.

872
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,750
'I don't know what to do, Peter.

873
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,360
My father will be so unhappy.

874
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,340
How could his brother do this thing?'

875
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,490
'Your Uncle Vili was very nice to us,' said
Michelle.

876
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,859
'And he is very nice to your mother.

877
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:06,950
I'm surprised that he could do such bad things.

878
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,520
The developer must be giving him a lot of
money.'

879
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,549
'My uncle has no wife or family,' said Iveri.

880
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,670
'He wanted to marry my mother when they were
young.

881
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,000
My mother chose the Ratu.

882
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,559
It made Uncle Vili very unhappy.

883
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:28,069
But he stayed on Tavioka and has been a good
brother and a kind uncle.

884
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:32,799
Now my father is old and not very strong.

885
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:38,250
My uncle wants to be chief when the Ratu dies.'

886
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,250
Peter said, 'Will you tell the Ratu in the
morning?

887
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,500
He needs to know what's happening.'

888
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,440
'Yes,' said Iveri.

889
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:54,530
'I'll tell him in the morning.'

890
00:52:54,530 --> 00:53:00,430
CHAPTER SEVEN

891
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,420
Enter Mr Brown

892
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,099
Peter was tired in the morning and wanted
to sleep longer.

893
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:10,670
Nicola wanted to read a book.

894
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:15,119
So Michelle and her father went for a walk
on the island without them.

895
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,080
They watched children washing in water troughs
outside their houses.

896
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,990
They visited the village shop and bought a
clay pot for Nicola.

897
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,920
Michelle took Tom to the river and showed
him the place where she and Peter had swum

898
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,250
with Iveri.

899
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:37,069
Everywhere they went people called, 'Bula!'
and smiled big, happy smiles.

900
00:53:37,069 --> 00:53:41,020
'It's a lovely place,' said Tom.

901
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,230
'It's hard to believe someone wants us to
leave.'

902
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:49,849
Michelle wanted to tell her father about Uncle
Vili, Sami and the developer.

903
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:55,310
But she didn't want him to go to Ratu Loti
before Iveri could tell his father the story.

904
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:01,079
She just said, 'The Ratu will find the bad
person soon, Dad.

905
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,000
I know it.'

906
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,380
When they got back, Peter was awake.

907
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,920
He and Nicola were sitting in the sun outside
the house.

908
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,640
'Have you seen Iveri this morning?'

909
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,030
Michelle asked Peter.

910
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,420
'No,' he said.

911
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,910
'Mum and I went for a little walk but we didn't
see him.'

912
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:24,430
'Maybe he went to work,' said Michelle.

913
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,170
Tom and Nicola were talking.

914
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,869
Nicola called the twins over.

915
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:31,819
'We've decided to stay here for the week.'

916
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:35,390
'Thank you,' said Peter.

917
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,060
'Vinaka!' said Michelle.

918
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,940
Later, Tema returned from Papaya Island Resort.

919
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,360
She almost cried when Tom told her the family
was staying.

920
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,200
She made them a picnic and they took it to
the beach.

921
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:56,690
They sat under a coconut tree and watched
the boats out to sea.

922
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,750
A white boat was coming towards Tavioka.

923
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,950
'Isn't that the boat that hit us yesterday?'
said Peter.

924
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:08,079
The Fijian, Sami, was steering.

925
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,520
The bald man was sitting next to him.

926
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,369
Sami stopped the boat close to the shore.

927
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:17,670
The bald man climbed out.

928
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,900
He was wearing a purple shirt and white shorts.

929
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,599
'It can't be,' Tom said.

930
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:25,690
'It's Jasper Brown!'

931
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:32,630
'Isn't he the man who got you to build him
a big hotel in Nadi?' said Nicola.

932
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:37,049
Peter said, 'And the hotel burnt down before
you got paid?'

933
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:38,049
'Yes.

934
00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:42,430
That was Jasper Brown,' said Tom.

935
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,060
He put down the banana he had been eating.

936
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,060
'Dad,' Michelle said, 'there's something we
have to tell you.'

937
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,849
Tom didn't listen.

938
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:56,820
He marched down the beach towards the men.

939
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,900
Nicola and the twins followed.

940
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,599
'Hey!' said Tom.

941
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,230
'I want to talk to you!'

942
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,930
Sami walked towards Tom.

943
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,039
'What were you doing in that boat yesterday?'

944
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,039
Tom shouted.

945
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,039
'Tom!'

946
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,720
cried the bald man.

947
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,320
'Tom Robinson!

948
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,730
What a surprise!'

949
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,430
He walked forward with his hand out.

950
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,890
Tom looked at him.

951
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,849
'Brown,' he said.

952
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,890
He slowly shook Mr Brown's hand.

953
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,549
'Is that man with you?' he asked.

954
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:32,010
Mr Brown walked away from Sami.

955
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,220
Tom followed him.

956
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,760
Nicola went over to Sami and started talking
to him angrily.

957
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,440
Michelle went close to Tom and Mr Brown.

958
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,369
She wanted to hear what they said.

959
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:48,099
'Sami's helping me here in Fiji,' said Mr
Brown.

960
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:49,990
'He told me about yesterday.

961
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,900
He made a mistake.

962
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,549
He thought the Fijian boy was someone else.'

963
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:56,549
'What?

964
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:59,660
Does he always hit other boats like that?

965
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,400
He's dangerous!' said Tom.

966
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,940
'He could have killed us all!

967
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,500
I'm going to the police.'

968
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,720
'He's very sorry,' said Mr Brown.

969
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,869
'Dad,' said Michelle.

970
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:12,660
'Later, Michelle.'

971
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,640
Tom kept talking to Mr Brown.

972
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,109
'What are you doing here on Tavioka?'

973
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:22,390
'I have business with the Ratu,' said Mr Brown.

974
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,900
'Bula!'

975
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,839
Uncle Vili appeared along the path.

976
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,599
'Good morning, Mr Brown.

977
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,599
Come with me.

978
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:30,700
I will take you to the Ratu now.'

979
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,790
'We'll meet again, Tom,' said Mr Brown.

980
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,360
'Perhaps,' said Tom.

981
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,319
Sami hurried after Uncle Vili and Mr Brown.

982
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:44,010
He looked behind him at Nicola.

983
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,119
His face was scared.

984
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:49,570
'What did you say to him, Nicola?'

985
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,570
Tom asked.

986
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:55,200
'I told him I'd find his mother and tell her
what he did,' said Nicola.

987
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,960
Peter and Michelle looked at each other and
smiled.

988
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:04,030
Their mother wasn't a big woman, but she could
scare people when she was angry.

989
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,750
Tom gave Nicola a kiss.

990
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:12,390
'Let's forget about Brown and Sami and finish
our picnic.'

991
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,819
They ate their food and later Michelle and
her parents went swimming.

992
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:21,280
Peter sat in the shallow water and watched
them.

993
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,369
They were still on the beach when Iveri came
back from Papaya.

994
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:29,859
'I couldn't tell the Ratu this morning,' said
Iveri to Peter and Michelle.

995
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:32,789
'My mother was crying about the homestay business.

996
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:35,450
I'm going to tell him now.'

997
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,040
The twins told Iveri about Mr Brown and Sami.

998
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,930
He listened, then said, 'I have to go,' and
ran along the path to the village.

999
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,680
When Iveri got to the rara, he found everyone
there.

1000
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,330
There was a sevusevu ceremony.

1001
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:59,869
Mr Brown had given Ratu Loti a bag of kava
and the Ratu was welcoming him into the village.

1002
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:06,690
Iveri didn't think the Ratu was happy, but
Uncle Vili was sitting proudly with Mr Brown.

1003
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,680
Iveri looked for Sami but couldn't see him.

1004
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,569
After the ceremony, Mr Brown walked around
the village with Uncle Vili.

1005
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:20,460
He talked to everyone and went everywhere.

1006
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,349
Iveri watched them.

1007
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:28,260
Later, when Iveri went back to his family's
bure, Tema told him Mr Brown was coming for

1008
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,630
dinner.

1009
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,849
Iveri said, 'Where is my father?

1010
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:33,210
I must talk to him.'

1011
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,690
Tema said, 'He is very tired.

1012
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,470
He is sleeping.'

1013
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:43,500
Tema made a fine meal for dinner that night.

1014
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,790
Everyone sat on mats on the floor.

1015
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:51,780
The Robinsons weren't happy to be eating with
Mr Brown, but they did it for Tema.

1016
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,000
Everyone ate with their hands, but Mr Brown
asked for a fork and spoon.

1017
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,310
Mr Brown and Uncle Vili talked and laughed.

1018
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,309
After dinner, the Robinsons said goodnight
and left.

1019
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,060
Mr Brown stayed and talked.

1020
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,500
He talked about the resort business in Fiji.

1021
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,920
He told the Ratu that there were a lot of
jobs in the resorts for villages that leased

1022
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,890
land to developers.

1023
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,859
The Ratu listened.

1024
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,359
Iveri listened too.

1025
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,910
Tema went into her kitchen.

1026
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:31,809
Later Uncle Vili said, 'I will take Mr Brown
back to Papaya now.'

1027
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:33,510
Sami still had not appeared.

1028
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,790
Where is he?

1029
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,309
Thought Iveri.

1030
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:41,450
Uncle Vili didn't take Mr Brown back to the
boat.

1031
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,190
He took him to see Tom instead.

1032
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:47,880
Iveri followed them, and watched from the
shadows.

1033
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,740
Mr Brown knocked softly on the Robinsons'
door.

1034
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,070
Tom opened the door.

1035
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,910
The smile on his face disappeared.

1036
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,430
'Oh, it's you,' he said.

1037
01:00:58,430 --> 01:00:59,559
'What do you want, Brown?'

1038
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:06,250
'Tom,' said Mr Brown, 'listen to me.

1039
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,210
I want to lease a large piece of land here
on Tavioka.

1040
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,630
Some people I know plan to build a big resort
here.

1041
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,069
We'll need a good builder.

1042
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:17,510
Why don't you help me?

1043
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,700
You'll make a lot of money.

1044
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,720
Vili says the Ratu likes you.

1045
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,210
You could tell him that a resort will be good
for the village.'

1046
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,720
Iveri stood very still.

1047
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,170
He liked Tom Robinson.

1048
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,050
He wanted him to say no.

1049
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:39,980
Tom said, 'I quite like Tavioka without a
resort.'

1050
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,359
Mr Brown laughed.

1051
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,359
'Money, Tom.

1052
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:43,359
Money.

1053
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,500
We could make a lot of money.'

1054
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,140
'Mm.

1055
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,740
I'll think about it.

1056
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,430
But I still remember the Nadi hotel,' said
Tom.

1057
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,359
'That was an accident!'

1058
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,829
'Goodnight, Brown.

1059
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:02,520
My wife is waiting for me.'

1060
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,520
Tom went inside and closed the door behind
him.

1061
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:13,869
Mr Brown stood at the closed door, and Iveri
heard him quietly say, 'Fool.'

1062
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:18,839
Uncle Vili and Mr Brown walked away towards
the beach.

1063
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,609
Iveri wished Tom had just said no.

1064
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:30,660
Any resort that Mr Brown built was not going
to be good for Tavioka.

1065
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,920
CHAPTER EIGHT

1066
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,049
Answers

1067
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:45,880
Early the next morning, before work, Iveri
talked to the Ratu.

1068
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,890
He told his father that Uncle Vili was working
for Mr Brown.

1069
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:54,130
He showed him the banknote and Michelle's
flip-flop.

1070
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,809
Ratu Loti put his head in his hands.

1071
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:58,130
'Oh, Vili...

1072
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:02,569
He should have been the Ratu after me.

1073
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:04,520
The clan liked him.

1074
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,520
Now he will have to leave us.

1075
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,880
He could have had everything.

1076
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,010
Now he will have nothing.'

1077
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,570
Ratu Loti asked Iveri not to tell Tema.

1078
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,020
'I must speak to Vili first.'

1079
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:23,760
Iveri and Tema went to Papaya Island together.

1080
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,690
On the way, Tema talked about Mr Brown.

1081
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,100
'Why did your uncle bring him to Tavioka?'

1082
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,100
she asked.

1083
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,049
'I don't want the Ratu to listen to him.'

1084
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:39,099
'He won't,' said Iveri.

1085
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:42,400
The Robinsons ate breakfast outside again.

1086
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,761
The Ratu was very quiet and sad.

1087
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:48,970
He sat in the sun with his eyes closed.

1088
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:53,640
Then he said, 'I'm going to see the men at
the church now.

1089
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,160
Tema and Iveri have gone to work.

1090
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:03,200
I've asked another of my brothers, Josefa,
to take you for a walk today.

1091
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,430
Josefa will take you across the hills.'

1092
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,390
The family went to put their walking shoes
on.

1093
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:16,880
'I think Iveri has told him about Uncle Vili,'
Peter said to Michelle quietly.

1094
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,730
'I think you're right,' said Michelle.

1095
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,140
'What will he do?'

1096
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,440
Their parents were talking about Mr Brown.

1097
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,230
'If you help that man I'll never talk to you
again,' said Nicola.

1098
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,450
'I know his kind of resort.

1099
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:34,950
The villagers work hard for very little money.

1100
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:38,740
There'll be false sevusevu ceremonies and
false mekes.'

1101
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:42,660
'I was never going to help him, Nicola,' said
Tom.

1102
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,410
'Why didn't you say no last night?'

1103
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,610
Nicola asked.

1104
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:50,670
'It's better not to answer a question like
that straight away.

1105
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,549
I've seen an angry Jasper Brown before.'

1106
01:04:53,549 --> 01:05:00,150
Michelle said, 'Dad, we've been trying to
tell you about Mr Brown.'

1107
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:04,680
She and Peter told their parents about Mr
Brown giving Uncle Vili money.

1108
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,490
They told them about Michelle's flip-flop.

1109
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,130
'Right,' said Tom.

1110
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,039
'I'll talk to the Ratu.'

1111
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:16,010
He got up to go to the church to find Ratu
Loti.

1112
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:20,250
Just then, Mr Brown appeared with Uncle Vili.

1113
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,809
'Tom!' he said.

1114
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:25,829
Today he was wearing a pink shirt and black
shorts.

1115
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,200
He was smiling.

1116
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,010
The Robinsons didn't smile back.

1117
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,340
Tom walked towards him.

1118
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,100
'Do you want my answer, Brown?'

1119
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,890
'That's why I'm here,' said Mr Brown.

1120
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:42,190
'I know what you've done,' said Tom.

1121
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:45,220
'You've tried to stop Tema's homestay business.

1122
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,160
Your man nearly drowned my son.

1123
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,390
I know that was part of your plan.'

1124
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,740
He went very close to Mr Brown and spoke very
quietly.

1125
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:58,390
'I'll never help you put a resort onto this
island.'

1126
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,660
Mr Brown's smile disappeared.

1127
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,760
Tom continued, 'I have some of my own ideas
about helping the village.

1128
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,460
I'm going to talk to the Ratu about them today.'

1129
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:13,910
Mr Brown's face was as pink as his shirt.

1130
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,750
'You're a fool, Robinson.'

1131
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,180
He stared at the family one by one.

1132
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,650
'You'll be very sorry.'

1133
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:25,190
He marched away.

1134
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,030
Uncle Vili put his head down and followed
quickly.

1135
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:31,670
Tom said, 'I'll be back soon.'

1136
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,580
He hurried away to the church.

1137
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:40,559
When he returned, Josefa had arrived to take
them for the walk across the hills.

1138
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,779
Tom said, 'We'll talk later.'

1139
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:46,609
They followed Josefa quietly.

1140
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:48,710
There was a lot to think about.

1141
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:56,319
When Iveri and Tema returned to Tavioka at
the end of the day, the Ratu was sitting outside

1142
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,400
with Tom Robinson.

1143
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,460
They were drinking tea.

1144
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,210
'Have you seen Vili?'

1145
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:05,270
the Ratu asked.

1146
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,180
His face was tired.

1147
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,049
'Was he on Papaya today?'

1148
01:07:10,049 --> 01:07:13,270
'I saw him,' said Tema.

1149
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,089
'He was with Sami.'

1150
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:18,780
'Mm,' said the Ratu.

1151
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,890
'Come and sit with us, Tema.

1152
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:24,950
You too, Iveri.'

1153
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,900
He told them that Tom wanted to help the village.

1154
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,210
'Yes,' said Tom.

1155
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:33,559
'I will help you with the homestay business,
Tema.

1156
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:36,920
I know a lot of people who will come here
to stay.

1157
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,309
I will help you build some bathrooms.

1158
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:42,220
I can bring electricity to the village.'

1159
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:45,540
They talked for a long time.

1160
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,210
They made a lot of plans.

1161
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,700
Tema was very happy.

1162
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,160
The Ratu's face was still sad.

1163
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,279
Tema made a big meal for dinner.

1164
01:07:56,279 --> 01:07:57,940
Nicola helped her.

1165
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,550
The women talked and laughed happily.

1166
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,589
Uncle Vili still didn't appear.

1167
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:07,750
It was a warm night.

1168
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:12,160
After dinner, Iveri and the twins went for
a walk on the beach.

1169
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,430
Then Iveri said, 'I must go.

1170
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:17,540
I have work again tomorrow.'

1171
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,420
'You work too hard, Iveri,' said Michelle.

1172
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,609
Iveri laughed.

1173
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:26,390
'Horse-riding with the tourists?

1174
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,500
It's not so hard.

1175
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,949
Tomorrow after work, we'll meet some of my
friends.

1176
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:34,290
We'll have a game of football on the beach.'

1177
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:38,630
That night, Michelle dreamt that she was in
Austria.

1178
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,650
She'd been skiing and was very tired.

1179
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,770
She was sitting by a wood fire.

1180
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:49,219
It was warm, and she watched the orange light.

1181
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:51,230
It was so real.

1182
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,719
She could even smell the smoke from the fire.

1183
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,680
She was getting too hot.

1184
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,279
She fought to wake up - it wasn't a dream.

1185
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:04,400
There was a fire in the room, and smoke was
everywhere.

1186
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,400
'Peter!'

1187
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
she called.

1188
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,470
He didn't answer.

1189
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,850
Michelle couldn't see through the smoke.

1190
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:16,569
She remembered the lessons about fire she'd
learnt at school - Get down low.

1191
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:17,569
Go!

1192
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:22,040
She lay down on the floor and moved towards
the wall.

1193
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,080
She found the wall and then the window.

1194
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,910
She pushed the flyscreen and climbed out of
the window.

1195
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,250
'Help!'

1196
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,290
she cried, but her voice was weak.

1197
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:36,730
Suddenly someone came out of the darkness
and climbed quickly in the window.

1198
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:39,020
Michelle couldn't see who it was.

1199
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,920
She banged on her parents' door and called,
'Fire!

1200
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,900
Our room's on fire!'

1201
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,630
Tom and Nicola came running out.

1202
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,409
Nicola screamed, 'Where's Peter?'

1203
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:50,200
'He's in the room.

1204
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,430
I couldn't get to him.'

1205
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,000
Michelle was crying now.

1206
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,300
Tom ran to the twins' room.

1207
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:02,170
Just then, the door opened and out of the
smoke came Uncle Vili and Peter.

1208
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,270
Uncle Vili was helping Peter to walk.

1209
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,430
Both of them were coughing from the smoke.

1210
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:13,370
Uncle Vili gave Peter to Tom, then fell onto
the ground and lay there.

1211
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:15,940
Nicola knelt beside Vili.

1212
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:19,230
'He's been burnt,' she said.

1213
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:23,060
Suddenly Tema was there, and Ratu Loti too.

1214
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,060
'Vili!'

1215
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,420
cried the Ratu.

1216
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,480
'No!'

1217
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:32,400
Uncle Vili opened his eyes and looked at the
Ratu.

1218
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,440
'Is the boy okay?'

1219
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,130
Tom was sitting on the ground with Peter now.

1220
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:42,360
Peter was still coughing, but he wasn't hurt.

1221
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,489
Tom said, 'Yes, Peter's okay.

1222
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:46,980
We've been very lucky.'

1223
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,850
The Ratu looked down at Uncle Vili.

1224
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:56,070
'Tell me you didn't do this too?' he asked.

1225
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:58,430
'No,' said Uncle Vili.

1226
01:10:58,430 --> 01:10:59,820
'I didn't.'

1227
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,420
Tears ran down his face.

1228
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,040
He took his brother's hand.

1229
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,140
'I told Mr Brown I wasn't going to work for
him anymore.

1230
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,730
I gave him back his money.

1231
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:13,920
He said I was going to be sorry.'

1232
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,500
Uncle Vili stopped for a moment, then went
on.

1233
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,420
'I think Sami started the fire.

1234
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,079
I saw him earlier.

1235
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:23,860
He was walking through the village with a
lamp.

1236
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,090
Then I saw him later, and he didn't have the
lamp then.

1237
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:27,090
I called to him but he began to run.

1238
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:32,940
Then I saw the smoke from the fire.'

1239
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:38,290
'Thank you for getting Peter out,' said Tom.

1240
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,910
'You saved his life.'

1241
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:44,310
Other villagers appeared out of the night.

1242
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:47,590
People began to fight the fire with water
and wet sacks.

1243
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:51,590
'They've got him,' someone shouted.

1244
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:56,520
Two Fijian men were coming forward, holding
Sami between them.

1245
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:02,190
One was Eroni, Iveri's brother, and the other
was Ratu Loti's brother, Josefa.

1246
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:05,890
'We found him running to the beach,' said
Eroni.

1247
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,860
'We knew the Ratu wanted to find him.'

1248
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:13,170
'He has a lot of questions to answer,' said
the Ratu.

1249
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:16,790
Tom said, 'We need to get Vili to a doctor.'

1250
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:20,610
The Ratu said, 'There's a doctor at the resort
on Papaya.

1251
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,030
We'll take him there.'

1252
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:24,980
'What about Sami?' said Tema.

1253
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,340
'We'll take him too.

1254
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,040
The police will want to talk to him.'

1255
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,760
Tom said, 'The police need to find Mr Brown
too.'

1256
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,210
'Yes, they do,' said the Ratu.

1257
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,820
'Come, Eroni.

1258
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,540
You too, Iveri.

1259
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,110
We will go to Papaya now.'

1260
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,870
Some villagers carried Uncle Vili gently to
the beach.

1261
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,449
Sami was led away.

1262
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,250
The fire was put out.

1263
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,610
'What will happen now?'

1264
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,130
Michelle asked.

1265
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:00,800
Tom said, 'Sami and Brown should go to prison.

1266
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,880
There'll be no resort on Tavioka.'

1267
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,560
'What about Uncle Vili?'

1268
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,750
Peter asked.

1269
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:08,750
'He saved my life.'

1270
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,040
Tema said, 'The Ratu loves his brother.

1271
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,020
Vili knows he did wrong and is very sorry.

1272
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:21,170
I don't think the clan will send him away
now.

1273
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:27,600
When he's better he can come home and help
me with the homestay business.'

1274
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,310
Later that week the Tavioka villagers stood
on the beach.

1275
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:35,770
They had just sung a goodbye song for the
Robinsons.

1276
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:42,520
Iveri, Tema and Ratu Loti watched the Robinsons'
boat leave Tavioka Island.

1277
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,950
Tema waved for a long time.

1278
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:52,770
Iveri's family was sad to say goodbye to the
Robinsons, but they knew they were going to

1279
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:54,210
see them again.

1280
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:59,400
Tom was coming back with some men to rebuild
the visitors' house and to bring electricity

1281
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,040
to the village.

1282
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:07,000
More tourists were going to come to Tavioka
when Tom and Nicola and the twins told everyone

1283
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,489
about the beauty of this place and its people.

1284
01:14:10,489 --> 01:14:17,130
Tema turned to Iveri and said, 'You will soon
follow our friends, my son.

1285
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:22,980
The Robinsons are going to send for you when
school in New Zealand begins again.'

1286
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,880
Iveri smiled.

1287
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,210
Peter had told Tom and Nicola about Iveri's
wish that he still went to school.

1288
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:34,120
So Tom and Nicola had talked to Tema and the
Ratu about Iveri.

1289
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:40,000
Then they'd asked Iveri to come and live with
them while he went to school in New Zealand.

1290
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,440
'Living with the Robinsons is going to be
an adventure,' he said to his mother, 'but

1291
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,610
I'll always come back to my island home.'
