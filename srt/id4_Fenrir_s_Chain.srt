1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,840
This is the story of Loki's 
children, and what happened to them.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
The god Loki had three children, but 
these were not ordinary children.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,280
Loki's children were a snake 
whose name was Jormungand,  

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,520
a scary woman whose name was Hel, 
and a wolf whose name was Fenrir.

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
At first they lived in Jotunheim, 
the country of the giants,  

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,520
but then they all came to Asgard, where the 
gods lived, and the gods were very worried.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,040
'I don't like Loki's children!' said 
Odin, the most important of the gods.

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,440
'Loki is a dangerous man.

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,720
He's always playing tricks.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:18,000
His children will be as dangerous as he is!' 
The goddess Freyja did not think the same thing.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
'But sometimes Loki is good,' she said.

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
'He has helped us lots of times.

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
I think his children can live 
here in Asgard, with us.'

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,680
'But they're a snake, a strange-looking, 
scary woman and a wolf!' shouted Odin.

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,800
'They can't live here!'

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,840
Thor thought the same thing.

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,400
So first they took Jormungand the snake.

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Jormungand was so big the gods needed 
all the strength of Odin and Thor and  

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,720
two other gods, Tyr and Balder, to pick him up.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Then, they threw him out of Asgard, which was at 
the top of the world, all the way down to Midgard.

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,280
With a big, loud noise, the snake 
fell into the world of the humans.

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,960
In Midgard, Jormungand started 
to grow and grow and grow.

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
In the end, there was no space  

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,320
left for him there, so he went into 
the sea which was all around Midgard.

25
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:03,840
When he was in the sea, he grew and grew until 
he made a circle around the entire world.

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,440
His tail went into his mouth.

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,840
'Now then,' said Odin, 'What 
about Loki's daughter, Hel?'

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,640
The gods all looked at Hel, 
and even they were frightened.

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,600
Her head was the head of a normal woman,  

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,080
but the rest of her body was like a 
skeleton, only bones and dead skin.

31
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,400
'I know what do with her,' 
said Odin, who was very clever.

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,800
'This woman is half-alive and half-dead.

33
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,320
She can't live with us, because we're gods,  

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,080
and she can't live with the humans 
in Midgard, because she isn't human.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
We'll send her to Niflheim!'

36
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,840
'To Niflheim!' shouted Freyja.

37
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,160
'But that's a terrible place! That is the 
place where people go when they have died!'

38
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
'Exactly!' said Odin.

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
'Hel will be the best queen for Niflheim.

40
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,840
I'll give her a city there, and the 
name of that city will be Hel, too!'

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,760
Because Odin was the most important 
god he always got what he wanted.

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,000
So Hel was sent down to Niflheim where she 
became the queen of all the people who have died.

43
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,840
'So, then,' asked Thor, 'What are 
we going to do with this wolf?'

44
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,920
All of the gods - Odin and Thor and Freyja 
and Tyr and Balder looked at the wolf.

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,640
'A wolf is only a type of dog,' said Freyja.

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,400
'That's true,' said Thor.

47
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,840
'And if you're kind to a dog, the 
dog will grow up to be a good dog.'

48
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
'Perhaps that's true for 
wolves, as well,' said Freyja.

49
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Again, all the gods looked at the wolf.

50
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
It was only a baby wolf.

51
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,960
It was beautiful, grey and 
white in colour, with blue eyes.

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,320
He was quite a handsome wolf.

53
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,680
'You know what I think?' asked Thor.

54
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:20,080
'No - and I'm not sure I really want to 
know what you think!' said Odin slowly.

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Thor's father did not think 
his son was very intelligent.

56
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,200
'Tell us Thor!' said Tyr.

57
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
'I think he can live here,' said Thor.

58
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,920
'We've given homes to Loki's other two children,  

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and this one will be no trouble to 
us, the gods, here in our home.'

60
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,520
'Thor is right!' said Freyja.

61
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,840
'Very well then,' said Odin, 
'The wolf can stay here!'

62
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,240
'Thank you!' said Fenrir - and the 
gods were all surprised that a wolf  

63
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
could talk! Everybody was very pleased.

64
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,680
The gods played with the wolf like a dog.

65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:30,160
The god Tyr was his best friend, and 
they played together all the time.

66
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
At first, everything was fine.

67
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
Fenrir the wolf lived in Asgard with the gods,  

68
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,840
and played in the big fields and 
gardens like an ordinary dog.

69
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
But Fenrir was always very hungry.

70
00:07:50,960 --> 00:08:02,480
He ate and ate and ate and as he ate 
he got bigger and bigger and bigger.

71
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,440
Often, when he was hungry, 
he started to get very angry.

72
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:19,680
The gods started to worry about this very 
big, hungry, angry wolf that lived with them.

73
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,320
'We need to tie him up!' said Thor.

74
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,440
'I think you're right!' said Odin.

75
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:40,240
So the gods found the biggest, strongest, 
thickest piece of rope they could find.

76
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,840
'Here, Fenrir!' they shouted to the wolf.

77
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,720
'We're going to tie you up so you 
can stay near us all the time!'

78
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Fenrir did not like this.

79
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,320
But he thought that if he was close 
to the gods, they would not leave him.

80
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,840
He thought they would give 
him lots of food to eat.

81
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,040
So he came closer to them.

82
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,840
When he was very close, Thor pulled out 
the rope and tied Fenrir up with it.

83
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,000
But Fenrir only laughed.

84
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,040
'Ha!' he said.

85
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,400
'Do you think you can tie me up with 
that? I'm Fenrir, the strongest and  

86
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:47,120
biggest of all the wolves!' Then - very 
easily - he broke the big, thick rope.

87
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,840
Now the gods were very worried.

88
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:04,000
Every day, Fenrir ate more and 
more, and he got bigger and bigger.

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,280
'We need to tie him up, but with a 
metal chain and not a rope!' said Odin,  

90
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
and everybody agreed with him.

91
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,640
So the gods made the biggest, 
strongest chain they could.

92
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,520
'Come here!' they said to Fenrir.

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,480
'Let us tie you with this chain, 
so you can always be close to us.'

94
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,120
Again, Fenrir did not like this, but he 
let the gods put the chain around him.

95
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:51,040
The gods tied the chain as tightly as they 
could, but again, Fenrir only laughed.

96
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,240
'Ha!' he said.

97
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,840
'Do you think you can tie me 
up with this little chain?  

98
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:12,240
I'm Fenrir, the strongest and biggest of 
all the wolves!' He pushed his front legs,  

99
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:22,320
and then he pushed his back legs and he 
growled, and then - snap! The chain broke.

100
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,840
Now the gods were very worried.

101
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,480
'We have a very dangerous animal 
living in Asgard with us!' said Tyr.

102
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,840
'That wolf is dangerous for 
all of us,' said Freyja.

103
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,600
'You're right,' said Odin.

104
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
'We must tie him up.

105
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,840
And this time we'll make 
the strongest chain of all!'

106
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
'What is that going to be?' asked Thor.

107
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
'Fenrir can break rope and metal chains easily!'

108
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,160
'What is the biggest and strongest 
thing of all?' asked Odin.

109
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,840
'What can never be broken?'

110
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,840
'I don't know,' said Thor.

111
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,360
'A mountain?' said Balder.

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,920
'Exactly!' said Odin.

113
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,240
'We'll make a big, strong chain from a mountain!'

114
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,720
So the gods made a chain out of 
a mountain, a chain of stone.

115
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,480
When the chain was ready, the gods asked 
Fenrir to come to them, but Fenrir would not.

116
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,600
'You're going to try to tie me 
up again, aren't you?' he said.

117
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,480
'I know what you're like!'

118
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
'No!' said Odin.

119
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,280
'We know you're the strongest 
and biggest of all the wolves.

120
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:27,120
So we have made a chain out of a mountain, 
because we want to see how strong you are!'

121
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
'Yes!' said Freyja.

122
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
'We want to see you break this chain!'  

123
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Fenrir did not like this, but he wanted 
the gods to see how strong he was.

124
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,640
'How do I know this isn't a trick?' he asked them.

125
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,200
This was a good question, 
and the gods thought hard.

126
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,400
'I know what we'll do,' said Odin.

127
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,640
'To show you this isn't a trick, 
we'll put the chain on you,  

128
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,240
and one of the gods will 
put his hand in your mouth.

129
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,600
If you can't break the chain, then 
you can bite off the hand of the god!'  

130
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,840
This was a dangerous thing to say.

131
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,000
If a god only had one hand, 
he could not hold a sword.

132
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,840
If a god could not hold a sword, 
he would not be a strong god.

133
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,960
'Very well, then,' said Fenrir.

134
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,200
'Which god will put his hand in my mouth?'  

135
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,840
Then he laughed, because he knew this 
was a difficult thing for a god to do.

136
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,640
The gods all looked at each other.

137
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
None of the gods wanted to lose a hand.

138
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,440
The gods all looked at the 
big, strong teeth of the wolf.

139
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
Only Tyr came forward.

140
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
Tyr was the bravest of the gods.

141
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
'I will!' he said.

142
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,480
'I'll put my hand in your mouth, and if you can't 
break this chain, you can bite off my hand!'

143
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,120
'Very well!' said Fenrir.

144
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,840
'Then let's start right now!' He laughed again.

145
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,880
Fenrir opened his mouth, and Tyr put his 
hand between the wolf's strong teeth.

146
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,280
The gods took the big chain, made out of 
mountain, and tied it around the wolf.

147
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Fenrir pushed.

148
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Fenrir pulled.

149
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:25,760
Fenrir growled, then pushed and pulled again, 
trying to move his legs as hard as he could.

150
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:35,920
He became more and more angry, 
and tried harder and harder.

151
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,840
But it was no good - the wolf 
could not break the chain.

152
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,240
After an hour of trying to break the 
chain, his long teeth closed on Tyr's hand.

153
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Tyr did not even cry out in pain - 
but he knew he had lost his hand.

154
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,840
From now on, he would never be as strong again.

155
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,840
Fenrir the wolf still lives in Asgard, 
tied up with a chain made out of stone.

156
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,400
He is still a very, very angry wolf, 
waiting for a chance to escape.
