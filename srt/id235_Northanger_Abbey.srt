CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,480
Our Heroine's Adventures Begin

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,290
If you had known Catherine Morland as a young
child, you would never have imagined that

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,420
one day she would be the heroine of a novel
filled with adventure, mystery and romance.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,109
Her father was a respected clergyman, neither
rich nor poor, and her mother was a strong,

6
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,179
sensible mother of ten children.

7
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,590
The Morlands were often described as a fine
family, but that was because there were so

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,660
many of them, not because any of them were
handsome, beautiful or noticeably talented.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:49,420
For the first ten years of her life, Catherine
was as ordinary as the rest of the Morlands.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,770
She was thin and clumsy, with dull skin and
hair.

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:00,640
She spent her time throwing a ball, riding
a horse or chasing her brothers and sisters

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,280
while avoiding any lady-like activities like
arranging flowers, nursing a poor injured

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,500
pet or watering a pretty rose bush.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,880
And certainly Catherine's education could
not be described as appropriate for a heroine.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,869
In fact, she had an obvious dislike for the
classroom and never could learn or understand

16
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:32,911
anything before she was taught; occasionally
she even seemed rather stupid.

17
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:42,170
Her mother wanted her to learn music and Catherine
was sure that she would like to play the piano,

18
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,970
so at eight years old she began lessons.

19
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:51,229
But she soon gave up, and the day on which
the music teacher was dismissed was one of

20
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,229
the happiest days of her young life.

21
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,750
Her drawing ability was also disappointing;
although she enjoyed drawing animals, all

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:05,520
her pictures, from chickens to horses, looked
very similar.

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,220
Whatastrange, incomprehensible character!

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,230
Incomprehensible because, in spite of such
clear signs of a difficult nature, Catherine

25
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,690
was seldom unpleasant; she rarely quarrelled
and was very kind to her six younger brothers

26
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,610
and sisters and quite friendly with the three
older ones.

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:33,010
But it still must be admitted that she was
untidy, noisy and wild and loved nothing better

28
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,290
than rolling down her favourite hill at the
back of the house.

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:45,480
At fifteen, Catherine's appearance began to
improve; her skin was brighter, her hair was

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,810
shinier and nicely styled, her eyes shone
and her figure was pleasing.

31
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:57,450
Her love of dirt was replaced by an interest
in the latest fashions and in the possibility

32
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,989
of going to a ball.

33
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,090
She was quite thrilled one day to hear her
father remark on her personal improvement:

34
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,010
'Catherine is almost pretty today.'

35
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,520
To be almost pretty is a great prize to a
girl who has been plain for fifteen years.

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,780
Catherine had never been interested in books
full of facts and useful knowledge, but from

37
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,560
the age of fifteen she began to read the type
of books which heroines must read: stories

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,840
of romance, adventure and fantasy, set in
mysterious foreign places.

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:46,700
These supplied her memory with useful instructions
about life, death, and especially love.

40
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,420
And although she could not write poetry or
play the piano or paint a picture - achievements

41
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,840
we might expect in a heroine - she began,
nevertheless, to admire those skills in others.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,120
At the beginning of our story, Catherine was
seventeen and eager for life.

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,349
But the world around Fullerton, the village
in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, did

44
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,579
not offer the kind of adventure and romance
that a heroine needs.

45
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:23,630
Luckily for Catherine, Mr Allen, the gentleman
who owned most of the property around Fullerton,

46
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,800
was required by his doctor to go to the city
of Bath for a healthy rest.

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,000
His wife, a good-natured woman with no children
of her own, was very fond of Catherine.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,501
She understood that a young lady of seventeen
is ready to take her place in society, so

49
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:49,650
she invited our heroine to accompany her and
Mr Allen to Bath for the season.

50
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:57,759
When the time came for Catherine's first trip
away from home without her family, you can

51
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,009
imagine the excitement and anxiety in the
Morland household.

52
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,680
Would Mrs Morland warn her daughter about
the evils of city life and the dangers of

53
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,130
mixing with the wrong sort of gentleman?

54
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,280
Would her father generously hand her a blank
cheque to cover every need?

55
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,090
Would the sister closest to her in age insist
that she write to her every day and tell her

56
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,830
every detail of her life in Bath?

57
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,030
Well, no.

58
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,699
This, after all, was an ordinary family from
rural England.

59
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,800
Mrs Morland simply said: 'Catherine, please
remember to wear your warm scarf around your

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,069
throat when you are out in the evening.'

61
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:48,680
Mr Morland gave Catherine a small purse with
ten pounds and promised more if it was needed.

62
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,940
Catherine's sister, Sarah, shouted goodbye
as she ran out to meet a friend.

63
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,800
In fact, the family had not realised that
Catherine was going to be a heroine.

64
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,950
They cheerfully but quietly sent her off without
any dramatic speeches, tears or warnings.

65
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,720
The trip to Bath was both calm and safe.

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,990
The carriage was not stopped by robbers or
by stormy weather; nor were the passengers

67
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,810
lucky enough to meet a hero before arriving
at their destination.

68
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,770
But when they arrived in Bath, Catherine felt
happy immediately.

69
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:34,720
Her eyes were here, there, everywhere as the
carriage drove through the pretty streets.

70
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,750
Soon Mr and Mrs Allen and Catherine were settled
in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.

71
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:48,130
And what do we know about Mrs Allen, Catherine's
close companion and chaperone for the coming

72
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,130
weeks?

73
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,200
She was the type of woman who amazes us by
finding a husband.

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,669
Why would any sensible gentleman, like Mr
Allen, want a wife without beauty, intelligence,

75
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,599
achievements or a pretty manner?

76
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,590
Well, she was generally quiet, did not concern
herself with his business and agreed with

77
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,450
his opinions on every topic.

78
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:24,129
In addition to these qualities, Mrs Allen
had two special interests that kept her busy

79
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:29,270
and made her a suitable person to introduce
a young lady into society.

80
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:36,660
First, she loved going out and never chose
to stay quietly at home.

81
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,000
Second, she found endless pleasure in fashion;
she would not consider taking Catherine to

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,319
any of the stylish Rooms in Bath until they
had both bought new dresses in the latest

83
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,190
style.

84
00:07:51,190 --> 00:08:00,900
When they were ready to attend their first
ball, Mrs Allen declared that Catherine looked

85
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,850
exactly as she should.

86
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,490
Such admiration was always very welcome when
it came, but Catherine did not depend on it.

87
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,419
Nevertheless, on this evening it made her
confident enough to face any crowd of strangers.

88
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,280
When they entered the ballroom, Mr Allen escaped
to a side-room to play cards with a group

89
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,760
of husbands.

90
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,070
Meanwhile, the two ladies looked around a
very full ballroom and, with Catherine holding

91
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,709
her chaperone's arm rather desperately, they
struggled through the crowd.

92
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:42,120
They finally found a place on a balcony at
the top of the long room with a good view

93
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
of the company below them.

94
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,950
It was a splendid sight and Catherine began,
for the first time that evening, to feel that

95
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,760
she was really at a ball.

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,930
She hoped to dance, but did not know anyone
in the room, and Mrs Allen did not see anyone

97
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,440
she knew either.

98
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,519
'Surely I should see a familiar face soon.

99
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,280
I wish I could find a partner for you,' remarked
Mrs Allen.

100
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,550
Catherine had no time to worry about dancing
because before long everyone began to move

101
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,190
towards the tea tables.

102
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,420
But Catherine and Mrs Allen were at a distinct
disadvantage without a party of friends to

103
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,760
join or a polite gentleman to assist them.

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,320
After being pushed and squeezed by the crowd,
they finally found two empty places at the

105
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,620
end of a long table where a large group was
already seated.

106
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,400
The two ladies were ignored and left with
no one to speak to except one another.

107
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,570
'Well, I am very pleased that I have not damaged
my new dress in this terrible crowd, I assure

108
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,570
you.

109
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:02,399
It would have been shocking to have it torn,
wouldn't it?' said Mrs Allen.

110
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,490
'I must say that I have not seen one dress
in the whole room that I prefer to mine.'

111
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:16,110
'It is very uncomfortable with no friends
here, don't you think?'

112
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,400
whispered Catherine.

113
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,960
'What shall we do?

114
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,610
The gentlemen and ladies at this table do
not look happy with us here.

115
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,960
We seem to be forcing ourselves into their
party.'

116
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,700
'Yes, it is very disagreeable,' said Mrs Allen.

117
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,940
'My good friends the Skinners would rescue
us if they were here now.'

118
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,279
'Shouldn't we leave?

119
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:48,519
There are no cups or plates for us here, you
see,' Catherine said with a worried frown.

120
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,350
'I think we should sit still,' said Mrs Allen.

121
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:58,089
'We shall be pushed and pulled in every direction
if we try to find another place in this crowd.

122
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,390
My dress could easily be damaged.'

123
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:09,279
'Mrs Allen, are you sure there is nobody that
you know in this great assembly of people?

124
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,260
You must know somebody.'

125
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:18,029
'Oh, if only I could see a familiar face,'
Mrs Allen said.

126
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,290
'Oh, look!

127
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,200
There goes a strange-looking woman.

128
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,110
What an odd, old-fashioned dress!

129
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,410
Look at the back of it.

130
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,480
How awful!'

131
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,520
After some time the two ladies received a
polite offer of tea from one of their neighbours

132
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,570
at the table.

133
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:41,630
They accepted gratefully and enjoyed a little
light conversation with the gentleman, but

134
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:49,139
that soon ended and no one else spoke to them
during the entire evening.

135
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,680
When the dancing came to an end, Mr Allen
found Catherine and his wife.

136
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,610
'Well, Miss Morland,' he said, 'I hope you
have had an agreeable ball.'

137
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:07,860
'Very agreeable indeed,' Catherine replied
politely, trying unsuccessfully to hide a

138
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,940
great yawn.

139
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:16,630
As the ballroom began to empty and the crowd
grew smaller, our heroine had a better opportunity

140
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,790
to be admired.

141
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:24,930
In her hearing, two gentlemen commented on
her to one another: 'There is a pretty girl.

142
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,610
Where was she all evening?'

143
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,460
Such words had a strong effect; Catherine
immediately thought that the evening had been

144
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,730
very pleasant.

145
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,650
Perhaps an experienced heroine would expect
more, but Catherine left the ball perfectly

146
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,640
satisfied with her share of public attention.

147
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,710
CHAPTER TWO

148
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,269
Extremely Agreeable Introductions

149
00:12:53,269 --> 00:13:02,149
Every morning now brought its regular duties
for Catherine and Mrs Allen: visiting shops,

150
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:07,399
exploring Bath, attending the Pump Room, where
they walked up and down for an hour, looking

151
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,160
at everybody and speaking to no one.

152
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,269
Mrs Allen repeated her usual disappointment
every morning: 'Oh, my dear, I would very

153
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,020
much like to find someone I know in this crowd!'

154
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,350
Then on Friday evening when they arrived in
the Lower Rooms, Catherine's fortunes improved.

155
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:35,390
Mr King, whose job was to act as host, introduced
Catherine to a young gentleman as her dance

156
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,519
partner.

157
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:45,339
Mr Henry Tilney was about twenty-five years
old, rather tall, with a pleasing, if not

158
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:52,899
quite handsome, face and, in general, an intelligent
and energetic manner.

159
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,839
He spoke politely and Catherine felt lucky
to have him as a partner.

160
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,760
When the two young people retired to the tea
table, Catherine discovered that Mr Tilney

161
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,410
was very entertaining company.

162
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:13,639
After some polite conversation, he said in
a dramatic whisper, 'Miss Morland, I must

163
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,639
apologise.

164
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:22,440
I have not asked you how long you have been
in Bath; if you have been here before; whether

165
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,300
you have been in the Upper Rooms, to the theatre,
to a concert.

166
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,740
Forgive me and allow me to begin my list of
questions immediately.'

167
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:41,540
Then Mr Tilney, with a bow and in an exaggerated,
extremely polite voice asked, 'Have you been

168
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
in Bath long, madam?'

169
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,150
'About a week, sir,' answered Catherine, trying
not to laugh.

170
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,810
'A week!

171
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,810
Really!'

172
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,339
replied Mr Tilney with excessive surprise.

173
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:04,560
'Why should you be so surprised, sir?' asked
Catherine.

174
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,580
She too was now speaking like an actor in
the theatre.

175
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:15,839
'That is a good question!' said Tilney in
his normal voice, 'But reacting to your answers

176
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,410
with appropriate emotions and gestures is
my duty.

177
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,300
Now let us continue.

178
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,850
Were you ever here before, madam?'

179
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,910
'Never, sir,' replied Catherine, enjoying
the game.

180
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,830
'How interesting!'

181
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,550
cried Mr Tilney, continuing with his actor's
voice.

182
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,990
'Have you been to the Upper Rooms?

183
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,060
The theatre?

184
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,959
The concert hall?

185
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,910
And are you totally pleased with Bath?'

186
00:15:50,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Catherine smiled at her companion and said,
'Yes, I have been everywhere, and I like the

187
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,769
city very much.'

188
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,829
She turned her head away, not knowing whether
she should laugh or not.

189
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:17,360
'Miss Morland, will you be writing unkind
things about me in your journal?

190
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,070
I predict you will say: "Friday, went to the
Lower Rooms and had to dance with a silly

191
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:32,209
man who bothered me with his strange conversation,
delivered in a funny voice.'"

192
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,170
'I would never say such a thing,' objected
Catherine.

193
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,350
'May I tell you what you ought to say?' asked
Mr Tilney.

194
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,740
'Please, sir.'

195
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,250
"'I danced with a very agreeable young man.

196
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,779
We enjoyed a great deal of pleasant conversation
and he seemed a most extraordinary and intelligent

197
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,779
person.

198
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,139
I hope I get to know him better."

199
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,049
That, madam, is what I wish you to write in
your journal.'

200
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:07,890
'But perhaps I do not have a journal.'

201
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,730
'Not have a journal!

202
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:18,720
How will you re-live every dance, every flattering
word, every admiring glance?

203
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,000
My dear madam, I think writing a journal is
delightful and so particularly suited to the

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,490
talents of young ladies, whose usual writing
style is perfectly faultless except in two

205
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:40,890
areas: a lack of subject, and no attention
to the essential rules that govern the English

206
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,890
language.'

207
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:50,250
'You do not have a very high opinion of ladies'
talents.'

208
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:57,240
'Actually, I believe that in every area where
good taste is the basis for success, high

209
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,120
achievement is quite fairly divided between
the sexes,' finished Mr Tilney.

210
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,880
But then this interesting discussion was interrupted
by Mrs Allen.

211
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,480
'My dear Catherine, can you look at my dress?

212
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,789
Have I torn it?

213
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,470
It cost me more than any other dress in my
wardrobe.'

214
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,550
'Madam, I can see why it was so expensive,'
said Mr Tilney.

215
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,179
'Miss Morland's dress, on the other hand,
is pretty but the fabric is too delicate.

216
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,260
It will not wash well.'

217
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:40,280
Catherine began laughing and said, 'Sir, how
can you be so...'

218
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,000
She almost said, 'strange'.

219
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,931
But Mrs Allen was delighted to talk about
her favourite subject, and Mr Tilney was polite

220
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:55,110
enough to continue chatting about fabrics
and current fashions for another five minutes.

221
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,770
When Mr Tilney and Catherine returned to the
dance floor, he noticed a troubled look on

222
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,400
his partner's face.

223
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,700
'What are you thinking of so seriously?' he
asked.

224
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,460
Catherine blushed; she had been wondering
if Mr Tilney had been too obviously teasing

225
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,549
Mrs Allen.

226
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:21,780
But she said, 'I was not thinking of anything.'

227
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,480
'You would not look so serious if something
had not upset you.

228
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,020
I would prefer to be told at once that you
choose not to tell me what you are thinking.'

229
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:42,940
'Well, then, I choose not to tell you,' replied
Catherine with clear determination.

230
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,230
'Thank you,' said her dance partner.

231
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,900
'Now I can tease you about your serious, secret
thoughts and opinions whenever we meet.

232
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,610
Nothing brings people closer than a bit of
teasing.'

233
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:05,040
They danced again, and when the assembly closed,
Catherine, at least, hoped that there would

234
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,620
be many more opportunities to continue their
friendship.

235
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,660
She did not intend to dream of Henry Tilney
that night.

236
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:20,190
As a famous writer has insisted, a young lady
must not dream about a gentleman or fall in

237
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:25,320
love with him before the gentleman declares
his love for her.

238
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,270
As Catherine's host and protector, Mr Allen
enquired about her dance partner.

239
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:37,260
Discovering that Henry Tilney was a clergyman
from a very respectable family in Gloucestershire

240
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,299
allowed him to feel satisfied that he had
done his duty.

241
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:51,539
With more than usual eagerness, Catherine
hurried to the Pump Room the next day.

242
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,930
She felt sure that she would see Mr Tilney
there and she was ready to meet him with a

243
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,930
smile.

244
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,650
But unfortunately no smile was required.

245
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,650
It seemed that every other creature in Bath
arrived in the room during the fashionable

246
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,230
hours; only Henry Tilney remained absent.

247
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:18,840
Mrs Allen once again repeated her usual complaint:
'How pleasant Bath would be if we had some

248
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,070
acquaintances here!'

249
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:27,090
This wish had been repeated by Mrs Allen so
often that it is not surprising that on this

250
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,250
morning she had her reward.

251
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,620
When she and Catherine sat down, the woman
to their right stared at them for a few seconds

252
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:44,400
before crying, 'Madam, if my eyes do not deceive
me, your name is Allen.'

253
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Looking closely at the woman next to her,
Mrs Allen cried in delight, 'Mrs Thorpe, my

254
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,940
old school friend - it is you, isn't it?'

255
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,110
The two ladies had not been in contact for
more than fifteen years, and now their joy

256
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,029
in meeting again was enormous.

257
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:14,679
They chatted excitedly, talking both at the
same time, and each much more interested in

258
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,340
giving than receiving information.

259
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,450
Although Mrs Thorpe was a widow, and not a
very rich one, she had one great advantage

260
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:31,240
over Mrs Allen: she had three sons and three
daughters.

261
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,880
Mrs Allen had no children to talk about, but
as she listened to all the news about the

262
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,230
Thorpe children, she enjoyed noticing that
her old friend's costume was quite inferior

263
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,680
to anything in her own wardrobe.

264
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
'Look!

265
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,370
Here are my dear girls,' cried Mrs Thorpe,
pointing at three smart-looking females moving

266
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,520
towards them.

267
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:05,380
'The tallest, the most beautiful and most
elegant is Isabella, my eldest.'

268
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,340
After Mrs Allen was introduced, she presented
Catherine Morland to the Thorpe ladies.

269
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,700
'Miss Morland!

270
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,440
You are the picture of your brother!'

271
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,480
the Thorpes cried.

272
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,770
They quickly explained that their brother,
John, was at Oxford University and was a great

273
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,909
friend of James Morland, Catherine's brother,
who was studying to be a clergyman like his

274
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,159
father.

275
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,160
Catherine remembered that James had recently
visited a college friend and his family near

276
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
London.

277
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
And this was the family.

278
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
How lovely!

279
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,790
Soon the eldest Thorpe girl, Isabella, invited
Catherine to take her arm and walk round the

280
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,929
room with her.

281
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,640
Catherine was so delighted that she almost
forgot Henry Tilney while she was talking

282
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,090
to Miss Thorpe.

283
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,029
Friendship is certainly the finest medicine
for the pain of disappointed love.

284
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:08,070
Because Miss Isabella Thorpe was four years
older, Catherine felt that she could learn

285
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,040
a lot about society from her new friend.

286
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,320
When they parted, she watched Isabella as
she walked away.

287
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,659
She admired the older girl's graceful walk,
her lovely figure, her fashionable dress,

288
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:27,970
and she felt extremely lucky to have found
such a charming companion.

289
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:35,380
That evening at the theatre and the next morning
in the warm sunshine in the Crescent, Catherine

290
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,590
enjoyed the sweet pleasure of her new and
agreeable friendship with Isabella.

291
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,710
She was so much happier than she had been
in her first week in Bath, but she desired

292
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,480
another meeting with Mr Henry Tilney and could
find him nowhere.

293
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,980
He must have left Bath, although he had not
mentioned his departure on Friday evening.

294
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:04,080
Of course this sort of mysterious behaviour
is always attractive in a hero, and it made

295
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,350
our heroine anxious to know more about him.

296
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:14,570
Isabella loved to hear anything with even
a hint of romance, and wanted to know everything

297
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:20,390
about Henry Tilney; therefore, he became a
regular topic of conversation for the two

298
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,020
young ladies.

299
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,390
Catherine re-lived every moment that she had
spent with the young gentleman, and Isabella

300
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,850
analysed the situation and gave advice from
her superior experience and wisdom.

301
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:41,250
'He must be a charming young man, and I am
sure he found you equally charming.

302
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,700
He must have important business in Gloucestershire
and will soon return to Bath.

303
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,210
And he is a clergyman!

304
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:59,770
I have a particular liking for clergymen,'
Isabella said in a rather dreamy voice.

305
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,120
Not being experienced in the etiquette of
romance, Catherine did not demand to know

306
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,049
the cause of Isabella's emotional response
to clergymen.

307
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:16,809
Perhaps as a good friend she should have insisted
that her friend tell her more about her 'particular

308
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,200
liking'.

309
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,580
The friendship between the two girls nevertheless
continued to grow and to become more and more

310
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
affectionate.

311
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,510
Even if the weather was very poor, the two
young ladies walked through mud and rain to

312
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,669
sit together and read novels.

313
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:39,330
Yes, novels!

314
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,540
To many people, novels are considered to be
nothing more than foolish nonsense.

315
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,660
But why?

316
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:57,080
Novels may not be as serious as books about
history or science or even art, but novels

317
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,010
have humour, mystery, culture and elegance.

318
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,420
Do not, therefore, say, 'Oh!

319
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,830
It is only a novel!'

320
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:14,640
Read novels and learn everything about human
nature in the most delightful language and

321
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,400
through the most entertaining plots.

322
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,220
Our two young ladies, you will see, had already
learned this lesson.

323
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,740
Listen to their conversation in the Pump Room
after a friendship of only eight or nine days.

324
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:37,620
'My dear Catherine,' Isabella began, 'I saw
the prettiest hat you can imagine in the shop

325
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,870
in Milsom Street; I must say that I longed
to have it.

326
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,240
But, Catherine, what have you been doing all
morning?

327
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,690
Have you read more Udolpho?'

328
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,029
'Oh, yes!' cried Catherine.

329
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:56,279
'I am at the part with the black veil.'

330
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:01,100
'You are desperate to know what is behind
the veil, aren't you?'

331
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,120
'Do not tell me!

332
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I know it must be Laurentina's bones.

333
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,320
Oh, I love Udolpho!

334
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,900
I assure you that only a meeting with you
could persuade me to come away from it.'

335
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,970
'How charming of you.

336
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:27,690
When you finish Udolpho, I have a list of
ten or twelve other Gothic novels that I am

337
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,350
certain you will love,' Isabella said.

338
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:39,279
'But are they all frightening and full of
dark secrets and mysterious accidents?'

339
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,500
hoped Catherine.

340
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,740
'Of course,' Isabella assured her.

341
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,700
'My friend Miss Andrews has recommended them
to me.

342
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:55,419
Miss Andrews is as beautiful as an angel,
and I often scold men terribly for not admiring

343
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,419
her!'

344
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:57,529
'Scold them!

345
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:05,169
Do you really scold them for not admiring
her?' asked Catherine, who was quite shocked

346
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,320
by Isabella.

347
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,630
'Yes, in fact, I told Captain Hunt at a ball
this winter that even if he teased me all

348
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,600
evening, I would not dance with him unless
he admitted that Miss Andrews was beautiful.

349
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,900
I am determined to show men that we ladies
are capable of real friendship.

350
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,679
For example, if I heard anybody say anything
negative about you, I would quickly lose my

351
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,679
temper.

352
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,690
Of course, that will not happen, because you
will always be a great favourite with the

353
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,690
men.'

354
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,980
'How can you say that?'

355
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,279
Catherine cried, blushing bright red.

356
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,580
'Dear Catherine, Miss Andrews is really quite
dull compared to you.

357
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:58,660
I saw a young man watching you yesterday,
and I am sure he is in love with you.

358
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,360
Don't look embarrassed.

359
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,419
I understand perfectly that your heart is
attached to another man, who shall remain

360
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,419
nameless.'

361
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:13,190
'But I may never see Mr Tilney again,' said
Catherine rather desperately.

362
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,899
'Don't say that I have lost my heart to him.

363
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:22,950
I will not think about him; instead, I shall
worry about the black veil.'

364
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,750
'Well, my dear, we will change the subject.

365
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,789
Have you decided what you will wear tonight?

366
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,210
I am determined to dress exactly like you.

367
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,570
The men take notice of that sometimes, you
know.'

368
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,600
'Does it mean anything?' asked Catherine innocently.

369
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
'Mean anything!

370
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,500
I make it a rule to ignore what men notice
or what they say.

371
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,910
They are often very bold if you do not treat
them with spirit and make them keep their

372
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,910
distance.'

373
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,640
'Are they bold?

374
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,570
Men always behave very politely to me,' said
Catherine, feeling quite confused.

375
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,799
'Oh, men think they are so important!

376
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:18,960
But, listen, I have meant to ask you something:
do you prefer men with dark or fair hair?'

377
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,220
'I have not really thought about it,' answered
Catherine, 'but perhaps neither.

378
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,770
Something between the two: a medium brown.'

379
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:38,940
'That sounds like your description of Mr Tilney's
hair, and he has dark brown eyes, if I remember

380
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,590
correctly.

381
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,610
I actually prefer fair hair and blue eyes
better than any other, but do not reveal my

382
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,029
preference if you know anyone like that.'

383
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:54,179
'Why would I do that?'

384
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,370
Catherine asked, feeling more confused than
ever.

385
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,279
'Catherine, let us drop the subject for now.

386
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,210
Let us move to the other end of the room.

387
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,820
I believe there are two bold young men near
us who have been staring at me for more than

388
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
half an hour.'

389
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:16,519
The young ladies walked to the book at the
front of the room.

390
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,580
'Watch those two young men, dear Catherine.

391
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,980
I hope they are not following us.

392
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,789
I refuse to take any notice of them.'

393
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:28,440
'There is nothing to worry about, dear Isabella,'
Catherine assured her friend.

394
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,799
'They have left the Pump Room.'

395
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:37,210
'Which way did they go?' asked Isabella in
a rush.

396
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,360
'One was very good-looking.'

397
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,059
'They went towards the church.'

398
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:46,570
'Well, I am very glad that I have got rid
of them!'

399
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,570
insisted Isabella.

400
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,139
'Now please accompany me to the hat shop.'

401
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:54,620
'That would be lovely,' agreed Catherine,
'but we may see those two young men if we

402
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,980
go in that direction.'

403
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,200
'I will not take any notice of them.

404
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,870
If I did, it would spoil them and make them
believe they were important.'

405
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,190
Catherine did not know how to argue against
this logic, so she and her friend walked as

406
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,990
quickly as possible towards the hat shop,
following in the steps of the two young men.

407
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,090
CHAPTER THREE

408
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,940
A Complicated Social Life

409
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,610
The young ladies' progress was stopped at
the busiest crossroads in Bath.

410
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:35,840
Every day parties of ladies out on important
tasks like buying cakes, trying on hats, or

411
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,690
even (as in the present case) searching the
roads for two young men, were held up by the

412
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,430
traffic at this corner.

413
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:48,510
'We shall be kept here for a terribly long
time,' Isabella complained.

414
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,200
'Look at this carriage coming towards us.

415
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,039
What dangerous driving!'

416
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,139
But Isabella's attitude changed when she looked
again.

417
00:33:57,139 --> 00:33:58,500
'How delightful!

418
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,029
It is Mr Morland and my brother!'

419
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:04,720
'Good heavens!

420
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,260
It is James!'

421
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,740
uttered Catherine when she saw her blond,
blue-eyed brother.

422
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,570
John Thorpe and James Morland got out of their
carriage, and although Catherine was totally

423
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,139
surprised by the arrival of her brother, she
greeted him with the most sincere pleasure.

424
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:30,000
James could not say much to his sister for
the moment because Miss Thorpe clearly intended

425
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,710
to gain his attention with her flirtatious
eyes and sweet smiles.

426
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,750
James responded to Isabella with a mixture
of joy and embarrassment which, if she had

427
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:46,271
been more of an expert in matters of the heart,
might have given Catherine a clue to the reason

428
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:47,950
for her brother's visit.

429
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:55,599
John Thorpe, a rather fat young man of medium
height with a plain face and ungraceful style,

430
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,890
immediately claimed everyone's attention.

431
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,680
Looking at his watch, he shouted, 'Twenty-five
miles from Tetbury to Bath in two and a half

432
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
hours!

433
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,030
We left Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven.'

434
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:15,110
'You have lost an hour, John,' James Morland
corrected him.

435
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,329
We left the inn at Tetbury at ten o'clock.'

436
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:21,270
'Miss Morland, your brother is dreaming.

437
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,020
My horse could never take over three hours
for such a journey.

438
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,080
And have you noticed my carriage?

439
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,740
I just gave fifty pounds for it to a friend
at Oxford.

440
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,780
Now, lead the way to Mother's lodgings, Isabella.'

441
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:45,570
Isabella was so happy to take James's arm
and when they passed the two offensive young

442
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,500
men from the Pump Room, she only looked back
at them three times.

443
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,540
Mr Thorpe accompanied Catherine, and no sooner
had they begun their walk than he started

444
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,300
to talk about his superior carriage again.

445
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,020
'Do you like an open carriage, Miss Morland?'

446
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,869
'Very much, but I have few opportunities of
being in one.'

447
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:16,350
'I shall drive you to Lansdown Hill tomorrow,
and I shall take you out in my carriage every

448
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:20,060
day that I am in Bath.'

449
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:27,280
Catherine was not sure if this was an appropriate
arrangement, but she said, 'Thank you, but

450
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,480
won't your horse need a rest?'

451
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
'Never!

452
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,030
That horse has only covered twenty-five miles
today.

453
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,860
Too much rest ruins a good horse.

454
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:46,650
I am an expert on horses and tomorrow you
and I will drive to Lansdown, Miss Morland.'

455
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:52,390
Isabella was listening to her brother and
turned and said, 'And what about me?'

456
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:59,260
'Isabella, I did not come to Bath to drive
my sisters around, especially not those two

457
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,790
ugly younger ones.

458
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,160
Anyway, Morland must take care of you.'

459
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,070
And turning towards Catherine, he said, 'Miss
Morland, let us be dance partners this evening.

460
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,350
It is always good to get these annoying arrangements
out of the way.'

461
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:22,010
After getting her agreement, Mr Thorpe seemed
to give up chatting with Catherine.

462
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:29,160
Instead, he made comments to her about the
appearance of every woman they passed.

463
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:37,119
Some he said were pretty, some fat, some old,
some almost handsome.

464
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,460
Although Catherine was very inexperienced,
she doubted if Mr Thorpe was behaving very

465
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,160
politely, so she tried to change the direction
of his comments.

466
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,520
'Have you ever read Udolpho, Mr Thorpe?'

467
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
'Lord, no!

468
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:59,040
There has not been a good novel since Tom
Jones.'

469
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,460
'You might like Udolpho; it is so interesting,'
said Catherine.

470
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:10,760
'No, if I read any, it will be one of Mrs
Radcliff's; she knows something about real

471
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,890
life,' said Mr Thorpe confidently.

472
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:24,800
Catherine did not want to embarrass Mr Thorpe,
but she had to say, 'Udolpho was written by

473
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Mrs Radcliff.'

474
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
'Was it?

475
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,810
Oh, yes,' Mr Thorpe replied.

476
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,500
'I was thinking of that other stupid book
by that woman who married a foreigner.

477
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,079
Keep away from anything she has written.'

478
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,760
Once again Catherine felt that she had misunderstood
the reasoning behind someone's opinions.

479
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:54,050
When James Morland visited his sister and
Mr and Mrs Allen at their lodgings later that

480
00:38:54,050 --> 00:39:00,460
afternoon, he asked, 'Well, Catherine, how
do you like my friend Thorpe?'

481
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:07,130
If John Thorpe had had no connection to her
brother or to her new friend, and if there

482
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,060
had been no invitations for carriage rides
and dance partners, Catherine would have said,

483
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,650
'I do not like him at all.'

484
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:22,000
But under the present circumstances, she said,
'I like him very much; he seems very agreeable.'

485
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,200
'He is a good-natured fellow.

486
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,839
Perhaps a little too full of opinions sometimes,
but you girls like that in a gentleman, don't

487
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,839
you?

488
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,540
And how do you like the rest of the family?'

489
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,810
'Oh, very much, especially Isabella,' Catherine
said happily.

490
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,450
'I am very glad to hear you say that,' said
James.

491
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:48,230
'She has so much good sense and is so friendly
and kind.

492
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,560
Since I met her, I have wanted you to meet
her and now I learn that she already has a

493
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,640
very high opinion of you.

494
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,410
I am sure you may be very proud of receiving
praise from a girl like Miss Thorpe.

495
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:07,369
And I am sure she is greatly admired in a
place like Bath, isn't she?'

496
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:10,940
'I believe so,' agreed Catherine.

497
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,390
'Mr Allen thinks that she is the prettiest
girl in the city.'

498
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:21,190
'I do not know any man who is a better judge
of beauty than Mr Allen.

499
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,870
And, dear Catherine, are you pleased to be
here?'

500
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:31,780
'James, I have never been so happy,' admitted
Catherine.

501
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,570
'Everything is so exciting, and now I am even
more delighted.

502
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:42,290
How good it is of you to come so far to see
me.'

503
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:49,930
The Morland children had been taught not to
lie, so James chose his next words carefully.

504
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:58,560
He simply said, 'My sweet Catherine, I love
you dearly.'

505
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,110
The Thorpes and the Allens, with Catherine
and James Morland, met that evening in the

506
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,430
Upper Rooms.

507
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,180
Isabella was all smiles when she saw Catherine,
and the two girls followed their chaperones

508
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,740
into the ballroom, whispering to each other
and exchanging affectionate glances.

509
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,770
James was engaged to dance with Miss Thorpe,
and invited her to join the sets of dancers

510
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,109
when the music began.

511
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:32,099
Catherine, who you will remember was also
engaged to dance, could not see her partner

512
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,099
anywhere.

513
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:40,430
'Mr Morland, I cannot possibly begin to dance
while my dear friend is without a partner.

514
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:46,980
We will wait here with her until my brother
returns,' explained Isabella.

515
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,430
Catherine felt very grateful for this kindness,
and she continued to chat with Isabella for

516
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,860
another three minutes.

517
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:02,230
But after turning to James Morland on her
left, Isabella whispered, 'My dear Catherine,

518
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,109
your brother is so impatient to begin.

519
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:09,540
I know you will forgive me for going away,
and I am sure John will return in a moment,

520
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,130
and then you can come and find me.'

521
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,470
Catherine was too polite to oppose her friend's
plan as she watched the couple hurry on to

522
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,450
the dance floor, but she was upset and rather
cross.

523
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:28,210
Not only did she want to dance, but she also
did not want to be pointed out as a young

524
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,750
lady in need of a dance partner.

525
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:39,069
Nevertheless, such things happen in a heroine's
life; Catherine suffered, but she made no

526
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:45,359
comment about the disappointment caused by
John Thorpe's rude behaviour.

527
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,660
After another ten minutes, Catherine was shaken
from this angry state by the sight of Mr Henry

528
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,690
Tilney, who was walking towards her party
with a young woman on his arm.

529
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:02,530
Fortunately he had not seen her yet so she
was able, like a true heroine, to hide her

530
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,270
blush and sudden smile.

531
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:12,190
Mr Tilney looked as handsome and as full of
life as Catherine remembered as he chatted

532
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,020
with the stylish, good-looking young woman
at his side.

533
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,869
Instead of turning pale and filling her head
with tragic thoughts of a possible Mrs Henry

534
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:27,630
Tilney, Catherine correctly guessed that the
young lady was the sister who Mr Tilney had

535
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,070
mentioned to her and Mrs Allen on Friday.

536
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:38,099
One of the ladies in the Tilneys' party, a
Mrs Hughes, was an acquaintance of Mrs Thorpe's,

537
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:44,730
and as she spoke to Isabella's mother, Mr
Tilney saw Catherine and smiled at her in

538
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,280
recognition.

539
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,770
Catherine returned his smile very prettily
and said, 'How nice to see you again, sir.

540
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,460
I was afraid you had left Bath.'

541
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,180
'Thank you, Miss Morland, for your fears.

542
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,170
I had to leave Bath the morning after I had
the pleasure of meeting you.'

543
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,680
'Well, sir, I hope you are happy to be back
again.

544
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:15,339
I find Bath an exciting place at this time
of year,' responded Catherine.

545
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:21,300
After a few enjoyable moments of conversation,
Mr Tilney asked Catherine to dance with him.

546
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,320
This delightful invitation produced terrible
anxiety in our heroine; and in giving her

547
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,690
refusal, she expressed her genuine sorrow,
explaining that she was already engaged to

548
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,130
dance with another gentleman.

549
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,830
Just then John Thorpe inconveniently wandered
over to the group and claimed Catherine as

550
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:43,930
his partner.

551
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:50,589
As they danced, Mr Thorpe's conversation about
buying a good hunting dog allowed Catherine

552
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:55,290
to keep watch on the part of the room where
she had left Mr Tilney.

553
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:01,480
She also looked around for Isabella, wanting
to point out Henry Tilney to her dear friend,

554
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,230
but she seemed cruelly separated from friends
and acquaintances.

555
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:15,530
As Mr Thorpe continued his one-sided conversation,
Catherine began to realise a useful lesson:

556
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,819
it is not always best to arrange your dance
partners before going to a ball.

557
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:26,599
But luckily Catherine's thoughts were interrupted
by a light touch on her shoulder from Mrs

558
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,599
Hughes.

559
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,480
'I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,' Mrs Hughes
began.

560
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,609
'Would you allow Miss Tilney and her partner
to join your set?'

561
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:41,910
Catherine could not have been more pleased.

562
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,880
She now had the opportunity to chat with Henry's
sister, and she welcomed the young lady very

563
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,020
warmly and politely.

564
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:56,990
Miss Tilney was attractive in every way; she
was not as fashionable as Miss Isabella Thorpe,

565
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,530
but she was more naturally elegant.

566
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:07,089
She was polite to everyone and was capable
of being young, beautiful and at a ball without

567
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:13,609
flirting with every man near her, and without
becoming over-excited or over-dramatic about

568
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:17,079
insignificant flattery.

569
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,619
At the conclusion of the two dances, Catherine
found her arm immediately seized by her dear

570
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:29,579
Isabella, who in an excited voice cried, 'At
last I have got you.

571
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,710
Why didn't you and John join our set?

572
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,619
I have been quite miserable without you.

573
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:42,680
I kept telling your brother to search for
you, but he was extremely lazy and would not

574
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
leave my side.

575
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,680
Isn't that right, Mr Morland?

576
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,240
I have been scolding him all evening.

577
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,430
You would be amazed.'

578
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:53,230
Catherine pulled Isabella away from James
and whispered urgently, 'Do you see that young

579
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,360
lady with the white ribbons in her hair?

580
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,210
It is Mr Tilney's sister.'

581
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,210
'Oh!

582
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,480
Let me get a good look at her!'

583
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,480
cried Isabella.

584
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,599
'I have never seen anyone half as beautiful!

585
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,599
So wonderfully dressed!

586
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:12,599
But where is her famous brother?

587
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,930
I am dying to see him.'

588
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:19,690
'What is all this whispering about?' asked
James.

589
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,410
'Men are so much more curious than women,'
teased Isabella.

590
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:30,880
'This is not about you and we will not tell
you anything about it.'

591
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,550
'And is that likely to satisfy me?'

592
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,330
James asked with a smile.

593
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,890
'Please don't listen,' Isabella smiled back.

594
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:46,290
'Perhaps we are talking about you and you
may hear something disagreeable.'

595
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:53,510
This flirtatious chat continued between Isabella
and James for so long that the original topic

596
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,280
seemed entirely forgotten.

597
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,880
Although Catherine felt a sense of relief
to have the subject of Henry Tilney dropped,

598
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,010
she was a bit disturbed by Isabella's apparent
lack of interest in her news.

599
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:12,579
When the music began again, James started
to lead Isabella to the dance floor.

600
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:21,290
'Catherine, tell your brother we must change
partners after two dances together,' Isabella

601
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,290
cried.

602
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:29,240
'My dear Miss Thorpe,' objected James politely,
'in these public assemblies, we are not required

603
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,300
to change partners.'

604
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:37,710
'You men,' cried Isabella, 'always insist
that you are correct about everything!

605
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:44,180
Catherine, tell your brother that everyone,
including you, would be shocked if we danced

606
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,180
together again.'

607
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:53,589
'I do not see why anyone would be shocked,'
Catherine said innocently, 'but if you think

608
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:57,470
it is wrong, you should, of course, change
partners.'

609
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:03,640
'You see, James, your sister is on my side,
but you will not listen to her!

610
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,390
Well remember, sir, it is not my fault if
all the old ladies start gossiping about us.'

611
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,230
And off she went to dance again with Mr James
Morland.

612
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:21,390
Meanwhile, John Thorpe had disappeared again
and Catherine had to return to her seat beside

613
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,490
Mrs Allen and Mrs Thorpe.

614
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:28,740
'Oh, my dear, did you see Mr Tilney just now?

615
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:35,079
He was tired of sitting and went off to find
a dance partner,' reported Mrs Allen.

616
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:38,849
'I thought perhaps he would ask you to dance,
if he saw you.'

617
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:44,230
'Where can he be?' said Catherine desperately.

618
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,600
She looked round and saw him leading a young
lady to the dance floor.

619
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,760
Catherine had missed the most desirable opportunity
of the evening and was not in a friendly mood

620
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,580
when John Thorpe came up to her and said,
'Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I should

621
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,589
have another dance together.'

622
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:07,520
'No, thank you,' Catherine said rather coolly.

623
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,960
'I do not intend to dance again this evening.'

624
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,190
'Oh, really?

625
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:16,020
Well, let us walk around the room and examine
everyone.

626
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,570
We could start with my two younger sisters
and their partners.

627
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:25,820
Did you ever see such silly, unattractive
girls?'

628
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,569
Catherine did not enjoy Mr Thorpe's comments
and again excused herself from joining him.

629
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:37,450
She sat with the older ladies and found the
rest of the evening very dull.

630
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,570
CHAPTER FOUR

631
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:44,410
A Shift in Our Heroine's Affections

632
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:51,599
Catherine's reaction to her disappointing
evening in the Upper Rooms was to go to bed

633
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,960
and sleep for nine uninterrupted hours.

634
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,349
She awoke the next morning perfectly rested,
in excellent spirits and with fresh hopes

635
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,260
and schemes.

636
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,420
She wanted to get to know Miss Tilney better,
and with that in mind, she planned to go in

637
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,980
the early afternoon to the Pump Room, where
any new arrival in Bath was likely to be.

638
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:21,200
And so our heroine happily sat with Mrs Allen
that morning, reading her book and smiling

639
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,740
at her companion's comments about everything
that crossed her mind, from a stain on the

640
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,890
carpet to the noise of a carriage in the street.

641
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:36,380
Then at about half past twelve, an extremely
loud knock on the door made both ladies look

642
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,740
up suddenly.

643
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:44,079
Before the servant could announce him, Mr
John Thorpe came running up the stairs and

644
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,220
into Mrs Allen's sitting-room.

645
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,790
'Well, Miss Morland, here we are.

646
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,400
Isabella and your brother are waiting outside
in their carriage and are in a great hurry

647
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,400
to get going.

648
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,680
Good morning, Mrs Allen.

649
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,579
A terribly good ball last night, wasn't it?

650
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:00,150
Have you seen my fine carriage outside?

651
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,700
Far superior to the rented carriage Morland
is driving.'

652
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,510
'Mr Thorpe, what is happening?' asked Catherine.

653
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,410
'Miss Morland, what a silly girl you are.

654
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,390
You agreed to go for a drive this morning.

655
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,750
We are all going up Claverton Hill.'

656
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:25,250
'I remember that you mentioned a carriage
ride, but really I did not expect you,' Catherine

657
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,250
explained.

658
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,190
'Not expect me!

659
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,900
I wonder how you would have complained if
I had not come for you!'

660
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,830
shouted John Thorpe.

661
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:41,420
Catherine did not know what to do and so looked
to Mrs Allen for guidance.

662
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,660
She wondered if it was proper to go for a
drive in Mr Thorpe's carriage without a chaperone.

663
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,510
Would Mrs Allen approve since James and Isabella
were going too?

664
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:58,810
'Well, madam, shall I go or not?' asked Catherine.

665
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:05,170
'Do as you please, my dear,' replied Mrs Allen
calmly.

666
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,030
She did not seem to understand any of Catherine's
anxiety.

667
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:15,690
A drive in an open carriage with Isabella
and James following behind in a second carriage

668
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:21,530
was almost as exciting as the possibility
of another meeting with Miss Tilney, and,

669
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:26,670
with Mrs Allen's permission, Catherine was
ready to go in two minutes.

670
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,859
As she and Mr Thorpe hurried out of the house,
they were greeted by Isabella.

671
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:32,859
'Catherine!

672
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:33,940
My dearest creature!

673
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,290
What a delightful ball we had last night.

674
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,120
I have a thousand things to discuss with you.

675
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,280
But now I am anxious to begin our adventure.'

676
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,170
John Thorpe helped Catherine into his carriage,
saying, 'Don't be frightened, Miss Morland,

677
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:51,370
if my horse shows a bit of spirit.

678
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:57,300
You are in no danger; I am an excellent horseman!'

679
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,010
With this warning, Catherine was surprised
when the horse started and continued in the

680
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,920
quietest manner imaginable.

681
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:12,500
A silence of several minutes was broken when
Mr Thorpe suddenly asked, 'Old Allen is one

682
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,349
of the richest men in Wiltshire, isn't he?'

683
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:24,809
'Oh, do you mean Mr Allen?' asked Catherine,
not understanding how this topic of conversation

684
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:26,250
had come up.

685
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,950
'Yes, I believe he is very rich.'

686
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,650
'And no children at all?'

687
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,170
'No, not any.'

688
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,930
'And he is a relative of yours, isn't he?'

689
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:41,980
'Oh, no.

690
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,099
We are not related,'

691
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:47,510
'But you spend a lot of time with them.'

692
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:51,600
'Yes, very much.'

693
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,410
After that short exchange, Mr Thorpe talked
about more topics that interested him: his

694
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:03,930
horse, the value of his carriage, his skill
as a horseman, the expensive wine he served

695
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,830
in his Oxford apartment.

696
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:11,980
Catherine had been brought up in a family
of plain people who were not in the habit

697
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,700
of telling lies or exaggerating their own
importance.

698
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,200
Mr Thorpe, on the other hand, was obviously
accustomed to a type of conversation which

699
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,829
always began and ended with praise for himself.

700
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:31,070
Catherine had little idea of how such young
men ought to behave, but she could not rid

701
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,119
herself of the conviction that Mr Thorpe was
not an agreeable person.

702
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:42,869
It was a difficult and bold conclusion to
come to, since he was her brother's friend

703
00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:49,680
and dear Isabella's brother; but in spite
of this, when she was in John Thorpe's company

704
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,569
Catherine was quickly bored and felt exhausted
by his lack of interest in anything but himself.

705
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:01,650
After what seemed like hours to Catherine,
the carriages finally returned to Mrs Allen's

706
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:02,650
door.

707
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,480
'Past three o'clock!'

708
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,890
cried Isabella.

709
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,009
'It is impossible!

710
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:09,810
I cannot believe my watch.

711
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:16,569
No two and a half hours have ever gone by
so rapidly and so nicely.

712
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:21,650
Don't you agree, dear Catherine?'

713
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:28,910
Our heroine could not tell a lie even to please
Isabella; but she was spared the need to disagree

714
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,980
with her friend because Isabella did not wait
for her answer.

715
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:39,130
'I have a thousand things to talk to you about,
but now I have to go home,' complained Isabella.

716
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:46,819
And with the gestures of a tragic actress
mixed with her satisfied smile and laughing

717
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:52,530
eyes, Isabella called goodbye to Catherine
and left her.

718
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:57,059
Catherine found Mrs Allen in her sitting-room.

719
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:03,869
'Well, my dear, I hope your afternoon was
as pleasant as mine,' began Mrs Allen.

720
00:57:03,869 --> 00:57:08,260
'I went to the Pump Room as soon as you were
gone and met Mrs Thorpe there.

721
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,390
Then we met Mrs Hughes and Mr Tilney and his
sister in the Crescent.

722
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:20,210
They are very agreeable people, and Miss Tilney
was wearing a particularly pretty dress.

723
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,310
Very expensive, I imagine.

724
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:26,720
Of course the family is very wealthy according
to Mrs Hughes.'

725
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,609
'Did you learn anything else about the Tilneys?'

726
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:31,799
'Quite a lot!

727
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:36,119
They are a very good, very rich family.

728
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,950
The mother, Mrs Tilney, was Miss Drummond
before her marriage and was at school with

729
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,160
Mrs Hughes.

730
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,049
She brought a large fortune to her marriage
to General Tilney.'

731
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:55,319
'And are General and Mrs Tilney in Bath?'
asked Catherine, hungry for more information.

732
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:58,730
'Let me think,' said Mrs Allen.

733
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:06,380
'I believe Mrs Tilney is dead, because Mrs
Hughes told me there was a beautiful set of

734
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,630
pearls that Mr Drummond gave his daughter
on her wedding day, and that Miss Tilney has

735
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,630
them now.

736
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,580
They were given to her when her mother died.

737
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,520
I think that is what Mrs Hughes said.'

738
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:25,119
'And is Mr Tilney, my dance partner, the only
son?'

739
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,250
'I am not sure about that, my dear.

740
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:35,310
I think he is, but anyway he is a very fine
young man according to Mrs Hughes, and he

741
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,470
has a good future ahead of him.'

742
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:45,309
Catherine deeply regretted having missed such
a meeting with both brother and sister, especially

743
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:54,000
since it had been replaced by a rather unpleasant
drive with a rather disagreeable companion.

744
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:03,730
That evening the Allens, Thorpes and Morlands
met at the theatre, and finally Isabella had

745
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,819
an opportunity to communicate with Catherine
about the thousands of things she had been

746
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:12,880
wishing to discuss with her dear friend.

747
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:20,200
'Now, Mr Morland,' Isabella began, turning
to James Morland on her left, 'I shall not

748
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:26,109
speak another word to you all the rest of
the evening, so do not expect it.'

749
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:33,490
Then turning to Catherine on her right, she
continued, 'My sweetest Catherine, how lovely

750
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,490
you look!

751
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,150
You are sure to attract every man in Bath.

752
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:43,299
My brother is already in love with you, and
Mr Tilney must have returned to Bath just

753
00:59:43,299 --> 00:59:44,580
to see you.

754
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,549
Look around and tell me if he is here.

755
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:53,030
I assure you that I can hardly breathe until
I have a look at him.'

756
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,820
'I am sorry,' said Catherine, 'I cannot see
him anywhere.'

757
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,930
'How horrible!

758
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:05,130
Am I never to make his acquaintance?

759
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,130
Do you like my dress?

760
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,319
I think it suits me, don't you?

761
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:15,430
Do you know that I am becoming quite sick
of Bath; your brother and I were discussing

762
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,430
it this morning.

763
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:21,910
It is enjoyable to be here for a few weeks,
but we both prefer the country.

764
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:28,359
I imagine that you have some clever comment
to make about the ridiculous fact that James

765
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:32,869
and I can find nothing to disagree about.'

766
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:37,560
'No, it does not sound ridiculous to me.'

767
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:43,739
'Oh, you would probably like to say that we
seem made for each other, or some nonsense

768
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:44,739
of that kind.'

769
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:47,099
'No, you misjudge me, Isabella.

770
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:53,090
I would never make such an improper remark,'
protested Catherine.

771
01:00:53,090 --> 01:01:00,410
Isabella smiled and gave Catherine a look
which seemed very significant.

772
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:07,520
Then she turned to her left and talked to
James for the rest of the evening.

773
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:13,520
The next afternoon, Catherine had a similar
experience in the Pump Room when she joined

774
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,150
her brother James and Isabella Thorpe for
a walk around the room.

775
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:23,810
Catherine soon realised that she had no part
in either her friend's or her brother's conversation.

776
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:30,039
The two of them constantly laughed and teased
each other or playfully argued about some

777
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:31,760
insignificant topic.

778
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,900
They often asked for Catherine's opinion,
but they never seemed to hear anything she

779
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,609
tried to add to the discussion.

780
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:45,170
Thankfully Catherine was rescued from this
situation when she saw Mrs Hughes and Miss

781
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,870
Tilney enter the Pump Room.

782
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,510
Miss Tilney greeted her very warmly and she
and Catherine enjoyed a pleasant conversation,

783
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,970
marked by a simple, honest style on both sides.

784
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:00,220
'Your brother dances very well!'

785
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,160
Catherine said innocently.

786
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,660
'And he is so interesting to talk to.'

787
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:11,750
This surprisingly direct statement amused
Miss Tilney.

788
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,250
'Henry!'

789
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,200
she replied with a smile.

790
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:20,970
'Yes, we have often said that he dances very
well.

791
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,880
And he loves conversation.'

792
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:29,319
'He must have thought it very odd the other
evening when he invited me to dance and I

793
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:30,319
refused.

794
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,610
But I really had been engaged the whole day
to dance with Mr Thorpe.'

795
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,320
Miss Tilney smiled and remained silent.

796
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,200
'I was so surprised to see Mr Tilney.

797
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,109
I thought he might have left Bath for good.'

798
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:55,030
'No, when you first met him, Henry was here
for a few days to find lodgings for us,' Miss

799
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:56,030
Tilney explained.

800
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:57,030
'Oh, I see now.

801
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:06,400
I think the young lady he danced with on Monday
was very glad to have such a good partner.

802
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,630
Did you think she was very pretty?' asked
Catherine.

803
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:17,539
'Not very,' answered Miss Tilney, who was
enjoying her companion's questions.

804
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:22,360
'I suppose your brother never comes to the
Pump Room.'

805
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,220
'He does sometimes.

806
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,569
But this morning he has gone riding with our
father.'

807
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:33,860
When the two ladies parted, Catherine was
not conscious of having revealed anything

808
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:39,630
about herself, but Miss Tilney was certain
that she had discovered something important

809
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,190
about her new acquaintance's feelings.

810
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:51,609
There was a ball the next evening and Catherine
dressed carefully, hoping that she would meet

811
01:03:51,609 --> 01:03:53,300
Miss Tilney and her brother there.

812
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:58,760
But before the Tilneys arrived, Catherine
had to work hard at avoiding the attentions

813
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,089
of Mr John Thorpe.

814
01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:06,599
She hid herself from his view as much as possible,
and when he spoke to her she pretended not

815
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,340
to hear him.

816
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:14,589
When the dancing began, Isabella whispered,
'Don't be shocked, my dear Catherine, but

817
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:16,970
I am going to dance with your brother again.

818
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:21,660
I hope you and John will join us when he returns.'

819
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,630
Catherine started to say something to her
friend, but Isabella hurried to the dance

820
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,730
floor.

821
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:32,180
Catherine could see John Thorpe approaching,
and she worried that all was lost; she might

822
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,170
have to dance with him again.

823
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,780
But what luck!

824
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,310
Mr Tilney appeared and immediately asked her
to dance.

825
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:45,420
Not only had she had a lucky escape from John
Thorpe, but it seemed that Mr Tilney had sought

826
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,250
her out on purpose!

827
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:52,000
They joined a set and took their positions
for the dance.

828
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,289
However, Catherine's happiness was disturbed
by the arrival of John Thorpe behind her.

829
01:04:57,289 --> 01:04:59,170
'Hello, Miss Morland!'

830
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:01,059
Mr Thorpe shouted.

831
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:05,079
'I thought we would be dancing together this
evening.'

832
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:12,050
'Mr Thorpe, you did not ask me to dance,'
replied Catherine.

833
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,510
'That is a good joke.

834
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,640
I asked you as soon as I came into the room.

835
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,880
This is a low trick to play on a fellow.

836
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,549
I told my friends that I was going to dance
with the prettiest girl in the room, and now

837
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:27,549
you have abandoned me.

838
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:31,049
And who is this partner of yours?'

839
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:35,170
'He is Mr Henry Tilney,' answered Catherine
quietly.

840
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,880
'I do not know him.

841
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,900
A good-looking man.

842
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,600
Does he need a horse?

843
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,500
I can get a good one for him from Sam Fletcher.

844
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:47,250
He sold me my last horse, a really good hunter.'

845
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:52,619
The dance was beginning now and Mr Thorpe
was forced to leave the floor.

846
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:59,829
When Mr Tilney came close to Catherine, he
said, 'I was getting very impatient with that

847
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:03,630
gentleman, taking your attention from me.

848
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:08,030
We have agreed to be faithful to each other
as dance partners for the evening; and a man

849
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:13,309
who tries to claim the attention of another
man's partner is breaking what I consider

850
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:16,279
an important contract.

851
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:20,529
Neither person should look around and wonder
about the advantages of having a different

852
01:06:20,529 --> 01:06:21,760
partner.

853
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,080
Don't you agree?'

854
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:30,830
'Yes, of course I agree,' answered Catherine
enthusiastically.

855
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:36,849
'May I come to the conclusion then that if
the gentleman who spoke to you just now were

856
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:44,400
to return, or if any other gentleman wanted
to talk to you, you would excuse yourself

857
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,779
and concentrate your attention on me, your
partner?'

858
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:56,210
'Well, it would be honest to say that I do
not want to talk to any other gentleman this

859
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:59,760
evening,' Catherine said prettily.

860
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:06,160
'I am very satisfied with that guarantee,
and I shall continue with courage.

861
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:13,030
Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had
the honour of asking that question before?'

862
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,770
'Yes, quite.

863
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:19,100
Even more so than before.'

864
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,839
'More so!

865
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:22,130
Be careful.

866
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:28,380
The fashionable young ladies always get tired
of Bath at the end of six weeks.'

867
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:34,590
'Well, other people must judge for themselves,
but I do not think I would be tired of Bath

868
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:37,770
at the end of six months,' insisted Catherine.

869
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:42,240
'I do not think I could ever be tired of Bath.'

870
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:49,000
As the dance progressed, Catherine noticed
a handsome older man with a rather noble attitude

871
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,500
standing in the crowd and staring at her.

872
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:57,530
Then she saw him whisper something to Henry
Tilney, and both men looked at her again before

873
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,599
the older man withdrew from the dance floor.

874
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:07,680
Henry politely approached Catherine and said,
'That gentleman is General Tilney, my father,

875
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,960
and he was asking me who you are.'

876
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,540
Later that evening, Catherine had a very welcome
opportunity for a chat with Henry Tilney and

877
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,540
his sister.

878
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:24,130
They discovered that all three of them had
a special liking for country walks.

879
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:27,390
'Shall we have a walk together one morning?'

880
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:28,980
suggested Miss Tilney.

881
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:34,390
'I would like that better than anything in
the world,' Catherine said enthusiastically.

882
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,390
'Shall we go tomorrow?'

883
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:43,600
The three young people agreed, unless there
was rain, to go out for a walk together at

884
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,700
twelve o'clock the next day.

885
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:52,069
And so, although she had seen hardly anything
of her good friend Isabella during the entire

886
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:57,540
evening, Catherine travelled home in the carriage
with Mr and Mrs Allen in such good spirits

887
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:03,200
that she danced in her seat all the way.

888
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:10,690
At breakfast the next morning, Catherine looked
out at a disappointing sky full of clouds.

889
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:16,850
Then at eleven o'clock, when she was watching
the weather with great attention, a few drops

890
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:20,060
of rain hit the sitting-room window.

891
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:26,009
'Oh, Mrs Allen, do you think the rain will
stop before midday?'

892
01:09:26,009 --> 01:09:32,350
'Perhaps it may, my dear,' answered Mrs Allen,
'but then the streets will be very dirty and

893
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,350
muddy.'

894
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,020
'I do not mind dirt and mud.

895
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:38,150
I would still be happy to go for a walk.

896
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:47,770
But, oh dear, now I see four raised umbrellas,
but I will not give up until half past twelve,'

897
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:48,770
Catherine said.

898
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,020
'That is just the time of day for the weather
to change.

899
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,770
Oh why can't we have the kind of beautiful
weather they had in Udolpho!'

900
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:05,270
Then just as the clock struck the half hour,
the sky really did begin to clear and the

901
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,700
rain stopped.

902
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:13,770
In ten more minutes, the sun was shining and
it promised to be a fine, bright afternoon.

903
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:17,910
Catherine continued to sit at the window,
hoping that the Tilneys would appear for their

904
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,600
country walk.

905
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,730
But instead of the Tilneys, she was surprised
by the arrival of Isabella and John Thorpe,

906
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,850
and her own brother, James.

907
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:35,390
'Be hasty, Miss Morland,' shouted Mr Thorpe
as he entered Mrs Allen's sitting-room.

908
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:39,910
'The carriages are waiting and we are all
going to Clifton to dine and then on to Blaize

909
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:40,940
Castle.'

910
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,210
'Thank you, but I cannot go.

911
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,989
I am waiting for my friends, Mr and Miss Tilney.

912
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:50,960
I am engaged to go for a walk in the country
with them.

913
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:58,560
They promised to come at twelve, but it rained;
now, with this fine weather, I expect them

914
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,560
here soon.'

915
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,710
'No, they will not be coming,' insisted Mr
Thorpe.

916
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,800
'I saw them in a carriage and heard them say
that they were going as far as Wicks Rocks.

917
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,469
Anyway, it is much too dirty for a country
walk.'

918
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:21,019
'Oh, that is disappointing,' said Catherine.

919
01:11:21,019 --> 01:11:22,560
'But what about this castle?

920
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,660
Is it really old?

921
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,340
Is it like the castle in Udolpho?'

922
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:33,360
'It is almost exactly the same,' said Mr Thorpe.

923
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,600
'Then shall I go, Mrs Allen?

924
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,300
What do you think?'

925
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,330
Catherine asked.

926
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:47,250
'Well, my dear, I suppose you should go,'
said Mrs Allen, and in two minutes the four

927
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,020
young people had begun their journey.

928
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:55,560
Catherine felt upset that she had not heard
anything from the Tilneys, but she had to

929
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,080
admit that she was excited about seeing a
real castle.

930
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:05,060
The carriages went down Pulteney Street and
through Laura Place, and John Thorpe once

931
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,650
again talked about his horse and his skills
as a driver.

932
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:15,550
Then near Argyle Street, Mr Thorpe said, 'Who
is that girl on the pavement who was staring

933
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,670
at you as we passed her?'

934
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:23,580
Catherine looked back and saw Miss Tilney,
walking along the pavement, holding her brother's

935
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,780
arm, and both of them were looking directly
at her.

936
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,980
'Stop, stop, Mr Thorpe,' Catherine cried impatiently.

937
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,700
'It is Miss Tilney and her brother!

938
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,670
How could you tell me that they had gone out
of town?

939
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:39,790
Stop, stop, I must speak to them.'

940
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,250
But John Thorpe did not stop.

941
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:49,870
In fact, he laughed and encouraged his horse
to go faster, and in another minute the Tilneys

942
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,551
were out of sight.

943
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:57,260
Now the carriage was moving so quickly that
Catherine could not possibly escape from it,

944
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,310
and she felt extremely angry.

945
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:02,900
'Why did you lie to me, Mr Thorpe?

946
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:07,630
And why didn't you stop when I asked you to?

947
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:11,420
They must think that I am very rude.'

948
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:17,620
Their drive, even after they had stopped talking
about the Tilneys, was not very agreeable.

949
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:21,949
Catherine obviously would have preferred a
country walk with the Tilneys, but at least

950
01:13:21,949 --> 01:13:24,290
she had a real castle to look forward to.

951
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:30,679
When they could see the town of Keynsham,
James Morland shouted at Mr Thorpe and the

952
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:33,150
two carriages came to a stop.

953
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:38,180
'We had better go back, Thorpe,' James began.

954
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,440
'Isabella agrees.

955
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,370
We left too late to visit Blaize Castle today.'

956
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:48,540
'It does not matter to me,' said Mr Thorpe,
turning his carriage around for the drive

957
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,810
back to Bath.

958
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:55,260
As they started again, he said to Catherine,
'Your brother is a fool not to have his own

959
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,630
horse and carriage.

960
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:02,640
If he had a good horse like mine, we could
easily have reached the castle today.'

961
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,980
'But he could not afford to keep a horse and
carriage,' objected Catherine.

962
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,400
'And why can't he afford it?'

963
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,310
'He does not have money for those things,'
replied Catherine.

964
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:22,020
'Well, I think it is a bad practice for people
who are rolling in money to be too mean to

965
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,520
have a good horse and carriage.'

966
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,350
Catherine did not understand what Mr Thorpe
was talking about, and she had become less

967
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:34,140
and less willing to listen to anything he
had to say.

968
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:40,030
They returned to Pulteney Street without her
speaking twenty words.

969
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:45,791
When she entered Mr and Mrs Allen's house,
a servant told Catherine that a young lady

970
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:51,850
and gentleman had called for her a few minutes
after she had set off with Mr Thorpe.

971
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:57,590
Thinking about this upsetting news, our heroine
walked slowly upstairs to her room, but was

972
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,739
stopped by Mr Allen.

973
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:06,139
'Dear Catherine, I am glad your brother was
sensible enough to bring you home in good

974
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:07,139
time.

975
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:10,120
It was a strange, wild scheme.'

976
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:18,781
That night our heroine went to bed feeling
confused and unhappy, unable to sleep because

977
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:26,199
she was busy re-living the terrible events
of the day.

978
01:15:26,199 --> 01:15:28,830
CHAPTER FIVE

979
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,060
Seeds of Misunderstanding

980
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:39,980
'Mrs Allen,' said Catherine the next morning,
'will there be any harm in my visiting Miss

981
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,060
Tilney today?

982
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:46,660
I will not be calm until I have explained
everything that happened yesterday.'

983
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:53,770
With Mrs Allen's permission and advice on
which dress to wear, our heroine anxiously

984
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,120
hurried to the Tilneys' lodgings in Milsom
Street.

985
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,610
The door was opened by a servant, who said
he would check if Miss Tilney was at home.

986
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:10,520
When he returned to Catherine, the servant
said, 'Miss Tilney has gone out.'

987
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,620
Something made Catherine think that Miss Tilney
was in the house but was too offended to see

988
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,620
her.

989
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:22,220
When she got to the bottom of the street she
looked back and saw Miss Tilney and General

990
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:25,990
Tilney himself coming out of the house.

991
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:31,610
Catherine's first reaction was to feel angry,
but then she remembered how her own actions

992
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:37,730
might have been misinterpreted and was determined
not to judge Miss Tilney unfairly.

993
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:46,350
Catherine was in a rather thoughtful mood
all day, but was persuaded to go to the theatre

994
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,110
that night with the Allens and the Thorpes.

995
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:54,610
The comedy, one that she had been looking
forward to seeing, almost immediately lifted

996
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,790
her mood.

997
01:16:55,790 --> 01:17:02,080
But at the beginning of the fifth act, Catherine
saw Mr Henry Tilney and his father join a

998
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:08,850
group of people in the opposite box and all
her anxiety and distress returned.

999
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:13,580
She lost interest in the play and watched
Mr Tilney.

1000
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:18,860
Finally he looked towards her and bowed; but
what a cold bow it was!

1001
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:24,090
He did not smile and immediately turned his
eyes back towards the stage.

1002
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:30,840
Catherine's heart raced and she felt miserable
and eager for an opportunity to explain herself

1003
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,160
to him.

1004
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:39,230
The play came to its conclusion, the curtain
fell and Catherine's wish came true: Henry

1005
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:42,440
Tilney came round to the Allens' box.

1006
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:50,210
He greeted the Allens very politely, but Catherine
did not wait for him to speak to her.

1007
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,210
'Oh!

1008
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:54,380
Mr Tilney, I have been quite wild to speak
to you to make my apologies.

1009
01:17:54,380 --> 01:18:00,750
You must have thought me so rude yesterday,
but really it was not my fault - was it, Mrs

1010
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,750
Allen?

1011
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:07,190
Mr John Thorpe told me that you and your sister
had gone out in your carriage.

1012
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,409
What could I do?

1013
01:18:08,409 --> 01:18:14,250
But I would have ten thousand times preferred
to be with you, wouldn't I, Mrs Allen?'

1014
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:16,630
'Yes, my dear, but calm down.

1015
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:19,980
You will damage my dress,' said Mrs Allen.

1016
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:25,699
'I begged Mr Thorpe to stop his carriage and
let me out when I saw you,' Catherine rushed

1017
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:28,040
on, 'but he would not even slow down.

1018
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:33,200
If he had, I would have jumped out of the
carriage and run after you.'

1019
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:40,350
No man could choose not to accept Catherine's
sincere apology and explanation, and Henry

1020
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:45,980
Tilney smiled politely and told her that she
must say no more about it.

1021
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:52,270
'My sister would also like to apologise to
you, Miss Morland, for her own behaviour this

1022
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,820
morning,' Mr Tilney added.

1023
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,820
'That is not necessary.

1024
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,230
It is understandable that she did not want
to see me after yesterday's disaster.'

1025
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:06,679
'But Eleanor did not choose to ignore you.

1026
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:09,710
My father wanted her to accompany him on his
walk.

1027
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:16,710
He is not a patient man and told the servant
to send you away, so I would like to apologise

1028
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,360
for her.

1029
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:23,280
And now may I join you for a few minutes?

1030
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:29,160
What did you think of tonight's play?'

1031
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,490
Catherine chatted with Mr Tilney for some
time and they made plans to take their country

1032
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:39,270
walk as soon as possible, which made Catherine
believe that she was one of the happiest creatures

1033
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,219
in all the world.

1034
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:47,220
But a new mystery appeared while the two young
people were together.

1035
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:52,060
Catherine observed with some surprise that
John Thorpe was in the opposite box talking

1036
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:56,370
to General Tilney and looking over at her
from time to time.

1037
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:00,410
'Does Mr Thorpe know your father well?'

1038
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,429
Catherine asked.

1039
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:06,870
'I did not know that they were acquaintances,
but my father is a military man and has a

1040
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:11,940
wide circle of friends.'

1041
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:21,110
On Sunday afternoon in the Crescent, Catherine
met Henry and Eleanor Tilney by chance and

1042
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:25,260
they decided to go for their country walk
the next morning.

1043
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:31,810
At almost the same time, the Thorpes and James
Morland were looking for Catherine to tell

1044
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:38,230
her about their plans for another carriage
ride into the country, also on Monday morning.

1045
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:45,710
'My dear,' Isabella began when they found
Catherine, 'we are going on our trip to Clifton

1046
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:46,710
tomorrow morning.

1047
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:52,720
You must be ready early so that we have time
to see and do everything.'

1048
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,215
'I am very sorry, but I cannot go with you
tomorrow.

1049
01:20:57,215 --> 01:21:00,850
I am engaged to go for a walk with Eleanor
Tilney and her brother.'

1050
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:04,850
'But we cannot go without you,' complained
Isabella.

1051
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:10,100
'Explain that you had forgotten you were engaged
to go with us.'

1052
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,580
'Don't try to persuade me, Isabella.

1053
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,530
I will not break my engagement with the Tilneys.'

1054
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:18,960
But the discussion did not end there.

1055
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:28,050
'My dearest, sweetest Catherine, you cannot
refuse such a small request from me, a friend

1056
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,159
who loves you so dearly,' Isabella tried.

1057
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,270
'You cannot possibly love Miss Tilney more
than you love me.

1058
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:42,130
You can go for your country walk another day.'

1059
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,340
But Catherine would not change her plans.

1060
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:54,429
'Well, I cannot help feeling jealous when
I see that you prefer strangers over me,'

1061
01:21:54,429 --> 01:21:58,271
answered Isabella, as she wiped away a tear
from her cheek.

1062
01:21:58,271 --> 01:22:07,230
It seemed to Catherine that Isabella was actually
behaving quite selfishly and not considering

1063
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,590
her feelings at all.

1064
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:16,260
'I am sorry, but I will not change my plans,'
Catherine insisted.

1065
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,630
'Very well, then that is the end of our party
tomorrow.

1066
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:26,280
If Catherine does not go, I cannot,' said
Isabella through her tears.

1067
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,969
'It would be very improper.'

1068
01:22:30,969 --> 01:22:35,250
'Why can't Mr Thorpe invite one of his younger
sisters?

1069
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:39,400
I imagine they would like to go for a carriage
ride,' suggested Catherine.

1070
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:45,330
Mr Thorpe, who had left the group for a few
minutes, heard this suggestion and shouted,

1071
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:51,020
'Thank you very much, but I did not come to
Bath to drive those silly girls around.

1072
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:57,310
And anyway, I have solved the problem, and
now we may all four go tomorrow with no worries.

1073
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:01,100
I have spoken to Miss Tilney and made your
excuses.

1074
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,100
You can go out with them another day.'

1075
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,100
'No!

1076
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:10,790
I cannot believe you would do such a thing,'
cried Catherine.

1077
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,170
'I have done it.

1078
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:17,980
I told her you had sent me to say that having
just remembered a prior engagement of going

1079
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,730
to Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not
walk with her until Tuesday.

1080
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:28,050
She said Tuesday was convenient for her, so
there is an end to our argument.

1081
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,719
That was a good idea of mine, wasn't it?'

1082
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:30,719
'No, it was not!

1083
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:37,880
I must run after Miss Tilney and explain everything.

1084
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:46,730
You had no business inventing a message from
me and trying to trick me into doing what

1085
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,370
I thought was wrong.'

1086
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:54,850
As Catherine rushed off to find Miss Tilney,
her mind was greatly troubled.

1087
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:59,830
She did not like disappointing and displeasing
her brother and Isabella, but she would not

1088
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:05,370
break a promise that had already been made,
and she would not fail to keep an engagement

1089
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:09,940
with Miss Tilney and her brother for the second
time.

1090
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:15,180
She saw the Tilneys and their father as they
entered their lodgings and hurried after them.

1091
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,460
'Miss Tilney!'

1092
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,740
Catherine shouted.

1093
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:23,350
'I told them that I could not go with them.

1094
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:28,020
I ran here to explain everything to you.'

1095
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:33,700
Although Catherine's speech was not completely
clear, the Tilneys understood her and everyone

1096
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,550
was on friendly terms again.

1097
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:42,489
Eleanor introduced Catherine to General Tilney,
who welcomed her into their house very politely

1098
01:24:42,489 --> 01:24:48,600
and invited her to join them for dinner one
evening if the Allens could spare her.

1099
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,000
After sitting with the three of them for a
quarter of an hour, General Tilney accompanied

1100
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,520
Catherine to the street and said goodbye in
the most graceful, friendly manner.

1101
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,409
At Pulteney Street, Catherine wondered if
she had been unkind to Isabella and James,

1102
01:25:05,409 --> 01:25:08,340
and mentioned their plan to Mr Allen.

1103
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:13,020
'Were you thinking of going with them?' asked
Mr Allen.

1104
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,070
'No, sir.

1105
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:19,640
I had just agreed to go for a walk with Miss
Tilney, so I could not go with them, could

1106
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,060
I?'

1107
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:27,480
'No, certainly not, and I am glad you would
not consider it.

1108
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:32,869
I do not approve of young men and women who
are not related driving around the country

1109
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:38,980
in open carriages, going to inns and public
places together!

1110
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:44,119
It is not proper, and I am surprised that
Mrs Thorpe allows it.'

1111
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:52,840
'I wish Mrs Allen had stopped me on the other
occasion,' said Catherine quietly.

1112
01:25:52,840 --> 01:26:00,980
'No harm has been done,' Mr Allen replied,
'but I would advise you, my dear, not to go

1113
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,390
out with Mr Thorpe anymore.'

1114
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:15,550
Monday dawned clear and bright and Catherine
was rewarded with a perfect walk in the country

1115
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:20,380
with the pleasantest companions: Eleanor and
Henry Tilney.

1116
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:27,590
The conversation covered every imaginable
topic, ranging from the novels of Mrs Radcliff,

1117
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:33,400
which all three were fans of, to an analysis
of the current government.

1118
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,620
Catherine listened with great attention after
the talk moved away from the Gothic novels

1119
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,080
that she loved so much.

1120
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,250
She was very impressed with how much both
Eleanor and Henry knew about history, art,

1121
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,750
nature and even politics.

1122
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:55,540
You may remember that she had never been a
very willing student, and this fact actually

1123
01:26:55,540 --> 01:27:00,460
made her very good company for such clever
conversationalists as the Tilneys.

1124
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:07,660
Obvious admiration for a young man's superior
knowledge is always a great advantage in an

1125
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,050
attractive young woman.

1126
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:15,410
The whole walk was delightful, and although
it ended too soon for Catherine, she was very

1127
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,630
pleased by its conclusion.

1128
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:24,450
When they returned to Pulteney Street, Miss
Tilney asked Mrs Allen if they might invite

1129
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,840
Catherine to join them for dinner on the day
after next.

1130
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:33,560
No difficulty was made on Mrs Allen's side,
and Catherine's only problem was to hide her

1131
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:39,410
excessive pleasure at receiving this kind
invitation.

1132
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:45,460
The morning had been so charming, so enjoyable
that Catherine had not thought about James

1133
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,460
or Isabella, but was reminded of them in the
afternoon when she happened to meet Miss Anne

1134
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:53,770
Thorpe in Bond Street.

1135
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:58,170
'Good afternoon, Anne,' Catherine began.

1136
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:02,670
'Did your sister and brother go for their
drive to Clifton this morning?'

1137
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:07,410
'Yes, my other sister, Maria, went with them.

1138
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,900
I think you had a lucky escape.

1139
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:15,650
It must have been a very boring, dull drive,
but Maria was excited about going.

1140
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:19,739
I decided immediately that I did not want
to go with them.'

1141
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:26,250
Catherine doubted that Anne wanted to be left
behind, but she was happy to know that the

1142
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:30,179
trip had not been cancelled because of her
refusal to join it.

1143
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:36,460
Before leaving she asked, 'And did Maria enjoy
seeing Blaize Castle?'

1144
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:39,950
'Oh, they did not see any castles.

1145
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:45,600
They had lunch at the York Hotel in Clifton,
and after a walk they had tea there too, before

1146
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,090
returning to Bath.'

1147
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:56,160
The next morning Catherine hurried to the
Thorpes' lodgings, wanting to be certain that

1148
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:58,490
she was on good terms with Isabella again.

1149
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:03,380
But Isabella seemed to have forgotten that
there had been any disagreement between them

1150
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:07,340
as she rushed into the sitting-room to greet
her dear friend.

1151
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:13,930
'Darling Catherine, from the beginning you
understood more about me than I understood

1152
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:15,410
about myself.

1153
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:19,120
You have seen through everything.'

1154
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,440
Catherine could not reply because she did
not understand what Isabella was talking about.

1155
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:34,330
'My sweetest, my most precious friend,' continued
the older girl, 'you can see that I am amazingly

1156
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:35,330
excited.

1157
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:40,420
Let us sit down and talk about what you have
already guessed.

1158
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:41,679
You clever creature!

1159
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:46,330
Your brother is the most charming man on earth.

1160
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,469
I only wish that I deserved him.

1161
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:55,810
But what do you think your excellent father
and mother will say when he speaks to them?

1162
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:59,659
Oh, I am so worried that they will not accept
me for their dear son.'

1163
01:29:59,659 --> 01:30:06,510
Finally Catherine began to understand what
Isabella was talking about.

1164
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:14,389
'Isabella, are you telling me that you and
James are in love?'

1165
01:30:14,389 --> 01:30:17,480
And soon Catherine had heard the whole story.

1166
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:22,770
The young couple had spoken of their love
for each other during yesterday's carriage

1167
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,080
ride.

1168
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:30,810
Now Catherine was thrilled to think that her
dear friend, Isabella, would one day be her

1169
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:31,810
sister-in-law.

1170
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:37,040
'Catherine, you will mean so much more to
me than either Anne or Maria; I feel that

1171
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:44,630
I will be much more attached to the Morland
family than to my own,' Isabella insisted.

1172
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:52,409
This idea astonished Catherine, and she honestly
thought it was inappropriate, but she was

1173
01:30:52,409 --> 01:30:56,739
delighted to hear Isabella's story of how
the engagement had happened.

1174
01:30:56,739 --> 01:31:01,540
'I remember the first time I met your dear
brother,' continued Isabella.

1175
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:05,820
'With me, the first moment settles everything.

1176
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:12,050
When he visited us in London, I lost my heart
to him immediately.

1177
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:20,119
I remember I was wearing my yellow silk dress,
and when I came into the sitting-room, I thought

1178
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:26,730
I had never seen anybody so handsome as dear
James.'

1179
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:31,949
Here Catherine secretly thought about the
power of love because, although she was very

1180
01:31:31,949 --> 01:31:36,500
fond of her brother, she had never once thought
that he was handsome.

1181
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,830
'Catherine, your brother caused me many sleepless
nights.

1182
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:45,080
I was sure he would fall in love with someone
else.

1183
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:48,080
He is such a wonderful man.

1184
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:55,580
I knew you understood what was in my heart,
especially when I told you that I had a particular

1185
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,500
liking for clergymen.

1186
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:02,699
I was sure that my secret would be safe with
you.'

1187
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:09,119
Once again Catherine was surprised by what
Isabella thought she knew, but she saw no

1188
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:11,690
reason to change her friend's mind about the
situation.

1189
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:17,320
She learned that her brother was already on
his way to Fullerton to ask for his parents'

1190
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,520
permission to become engaged to Miss Isabella
Thorpe.

1191
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,310
'Will they accept me, dear Catherine?

1192
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:30,230
My fortune is very small and your brother
could marry anyone he chose.'

1193
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:39,270
Again Catherine thought about the strength
of love and said, 'Isabella, you are too humble.

1194
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,639
The difference between your fortunes will
not affect anything.'

1195
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:48,389
'Catherine, not everyone would have such a
generous heart as yours.

1196
01:32:48,389 --> 01:32:51,530
I just wish that the situations were reversed.

1197
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:58,100
If I had command of millions and ruled the
world, your brother would be my only choice.

1198
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:05,580
I need very little in life, and where people
are attached by love, poverty itself is not

1199
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,580
a problem.'

1200
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:12,550
Catherine liked this idea; it sounded like
something from one of her novels.

1201
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:19,520
'I will not think of a wedding or a house
or anything of that sort until we have your

1202
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,880
father's answer,' continued Isabella.

1203
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:27,850
'Your dear brother said that he will send
me news tomorrow, but I know I will not have

1204
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:33,050
courage enough to open his letter.'

1205
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:39,730
The two friends spent every moment together
that day and the next, talking of nothing

1206
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:43,040
except how happy they would be as sisters.

1207
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:48,620
Finally, after much anxiety, the post was
delivered on the second day and Isabella opened

1208
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,460
her letter from Fullerton.

1209
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,460
James wrote:

1210
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:58,840
I have gained the approval of my kind parents,
and they promise that everything in their

1211
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,500
power will be done to guarantee my happiness.

1212
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:10,370
The brightest look spread across Isabella's
face and she said that she was the happiest

1213
01:34:10,370 --> 01:34:12,060
woman on earth.

1214
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:19,420
The entire Thorpe family were now very happy
and wanted to hear about the details of Mr

1215
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:22,620
Morland's promise: What would his income be?

1216
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:25,659
Would he be given property by his family?

1217
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:29,250
What kind of ring would Isabella receive?

1218
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:33,850
What would their carriage and their house
be like?

1219
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:36,960
Where would they live?

1220
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:42,610
Mr John Thorpe had business in London and
now that Isabella had her letter, he prepared

1221
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,750
to depart.

1222
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:51,040
'Well, Miss Morland,' he said, finding Catherine
alone in the sitting-room, 'I have come to

1223
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,380
say goodbye for the present time.'

1224
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,380
'Goodbye, sir.

1225
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,000
I hope you have a safe journey.'

1226
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,700
'What do you think of this marrying idea,
Miss Morland?'

1227
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:07,659
'I am sure marriage is a very good thing,'
replied Catherine.

1228
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:09,070
'Do you?

1229
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,030
I am glad you are not an enemy to marriage.

1230
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:20,330
By the way, do you know that old song that
says, "One wedding brings another"?

1231
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:27,370
Perhaps we may find out if that old song has
some truth in it at Isabella's wedding.'

1232
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:31,750
'May we?' asked Catherine, feeling quite confused.

1233
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:35,700
'But I never sing, so I would not know.

1234
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,369
Well, I wish you a good journey.

1235
01:35:38,369 --> 01:35:43,210
I dine with Miss Tilney today, so I must rush
home.'

1236
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:45,660
'Don't hurry away.

1237
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:51,250
I will be gone from Bath for a fortnight and
it will seem a long time.

1238
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,739
When will we be together again?'

1239
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:59,400
'Well, we will see you when you return.

1240
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,619
Goodbye for now,' said Catherine, trying to
get away.

1241
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:07,130
'That is very kind of you, Miss Morland.

1242
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:10,631
You are probably the nicest person I know.

1243
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:14,950
You have so many good qualities.'

1244
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:22,639
'Sir, there are much nicer, better people
than me.

1245
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:27,380
Good morning to you.

1246
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,380
I must get home.'

1247
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,420
'But Miss Morland, may I visit Fullerton one
day soon?'

1248
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:33,370
'My father and mother would be pleased to
meet you.'

1249
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:38,820
'And I hope, Miss Morland, that you would
be pleased to see me there.'

1250
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:43,770
'It is always nice to have company at our
house.'

1251
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:51,199
'I agree with you - give me some cheerful
company and I am very happy.

1252
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,080
I believe you and I agree about most things.'

1253
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,810
'That idea has never occurred to me,' said
Catherine.

1254
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:02,219
'In fact, I do not know my own mind about
most things.'

1255
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:05,670
'I am the same,' cried Mr Thorpe.

1256
01:37:05,670 --> 01:37:09,000
'I have a simple idea about most things.

1257
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:16,350
Let me have a girl I like and a comfortable
house and I would be satisfied.

1258
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:18,000
Fortune is nothing.

1259
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,150
I am sure of a good income of my own, so my
wife does not need to have a penny.'

1260
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:28,360
'I am in agreement with you there, sir.

1261
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,470
If there is a good fortune on one side, there
can be no need for any on the other.

1262
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:37,301
I hate the idea of one great fortune marrying
another.

1263
01:37:37,301 --> 01:37:41,780
And I think it is very wicked of people to
marry for money.

1264
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,780
Goodbye.

1265
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,790
We shall be glad to see you in Fullerton one
day.'

1266
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:52,310
And having said that, Catherine hurried out
of the Thorpes' house without another thought

1267
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:54,250
about John Thorpe.

1268
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:59,110
She was concentrating on getting ready for
her dinner with Miss Tilney.

1269
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:05,719
Mr Thorpe felt very satisfied; he believed
that Miss Morland had clearly encouraged his

1270
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:15,429
attentions and he intended to pursue her confidently
and without hesitation.

1271
01:38:15,429 --> 01:38:16,699
CHAPTER SIX

1272
01:38:16,699 --> 01:38:21,780
A Friend's True Nature Revealed?

1273
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:27,010
Catherine went to the Tilneys' lodgings with
high hopes of a particularly pleasurable evening,

1274
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:32,139
and of course this could only lead to disappointment.

1275
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:39,000
Although General Tilney was extremely polite
to her, Eleanor Tilney welcomed her warmly

1276
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,949
and Henry Tilney was as charming as usual,
the happiness that Catherine had expected

1277
01:38:44,949 --> 01:38:46,179
was not achieved.

1278
01:38:46,179 --> 01:38:53,710
Somehow the evening did not have the spirit,
or perhaps the magic, that Catherine had wished

1279
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:54,710
for.

1280
01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:00,841
On leaving the party, Catherine's conclusion
was that nobody was to blame, and that the

1281
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:06,120
evening was just one of those unfortunate
failures that happen occasionally.

1282
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:11,430
But when she described the evening to Isabella,
her reaction was very different.

1283
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:14,389
'I blame it on pride.

1284
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:16,170
Rude, unbearable pride!

1285
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:20,330
The people in that family think they are very
grand.

1286
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:25,310
I have never heard of such unfriendly behaviour
as Miss Tilney's.

1287
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:29,469
Hardly even to speak to you, a guest!'

1288
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:33,699
'But, Isabella, you are misinterpreting my
words.

1289
01:39:33,699 --> 01:39:41,130
Miss Tilney was not rude; she was very polite,
very proper and correct.'

1290
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:42,130
'Please don't defend her.

1291
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,130
Or her brother!

1292
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:48,579
He had appeared so attached to you and then
he hardly looked at you when you were a guest

1293
01:39:48,579 --> 01:39:50,080
in their house!

1294
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,750
How rude!'

1295
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:55,080
'No, Isabella.

1296
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,480
That is not what I said.

1297
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,270
I simply meant that he did not seem in good
spirits.'

1298
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:04,280
'I hate this type of inconstant behaviour
in anyone.

1299
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:10,730
Never think of him again; he does not deserve
your attention.'

1300
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:13,840
'I do not suppose that he ever thinks of me,'
said Catherine.

1301
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,469
'Do you see how different he is from your
brother and from mine?

1302
01:40:19,469 --> 01:40:24,800
I really believe that John has the most faithful
heart.'

1303
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:30,810
'But General Tilney, I assure you, could not
have treated me with more attention or with

1304
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:31,810
greater politeness.

1305
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:37,580
It seemed that his only care was to make me
happy.'

1306
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:41,679
'Oh, I do not suspect him of pride.

1307
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:47,440
John thinks very highly of him, and I trust
my brother's judgement.'

1308
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:55,119
'Well, we will meet again this evening at
the Rooms, so I will wait until then to judge

1309
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,349
their behaviour towards me.'

1310
01:40:56,349 --> 01:41:00,500
'And must I go?' asked Isabella.

1311
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:07,280
'Of course, I can refuse you nothing, but
you know that my heart is elsewhere.

1312
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:14,500
And you know that it is completely out of
the question for me to think of dancing, so

1313
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:20,830
please do not suggest it, although I know
that Charles Hodges will beg me to dance with

1314
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,940
him.'

1315
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:29,219
Isabella's opinion of the Tilneys did not
influence Catherine's view of them.

1316
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:34,980
She was certain that they had not meant to
be quiet or proud when she dined with them,

1317
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:37,670
and that evening she was proved right.

1318
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:43,949
Both Miss Tilney and her brother were dearly
happy to see her and treated her very kindly

1319
01:41:43,949 --> 01:41:50,929
throughout the evening, and once again she
enjoyed her usual happiness as Henry's dance

1320
01:41:50,929 --> 01:41:51,929
partner.

1321
01:41:51,929 --> 01:42:01,230
At the end of the first dance, a tall, handsome
young man approached Eleanor and Henry Tilney,

1322
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:06,800
and Catherine learned that this was their
older brother, Captain Tilney.

1323
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,429
After a short, polite conversation, the older
brother asked if they knew the pretty young

1324
01:42:11,429 --> 01:42:14,630
woman sitting with some of the older ladies.

1325
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:20,000
Catherine explained that it was her good friend
Isabella Thorpe.

1326
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,290
'Could you please introduce me to her?' asked
Captain Tilney.

1327
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:28,250
'I would like to invite her to dance.'

1328
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:34,160
'I am afraid that she would not dance this
evening for any reason in the world, although

1329
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:40,469
I think it is very kind of you to think she
might wish for a partner,' said Catherine.

1330
01:42:40,469 --> 01:42:47,610
When Catherine and Henry were returning to
the dance floor, Henry said, 'Thank you for

1331
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:53,690
thinking that my brother was being kind in
wanting to dance with Miss Thorpe.

1332
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:59,270
You allow the rest of the world to have motives
that are as good and generous as your own.'

1333
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:06,060
Catherine was lost in thought about Henry's
comment when she heard Isabella's voice.

1334
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:13,310
She looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney,
standing in the set opposite her and Henry.

1335
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:19,530
Isabella raised her eyebrows for a second
and then smiled.

1336
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:22,580
'How could this happen?'

1337
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,980
Catherine said to Henry.

1338
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,260
'Isabella was so determined not to dance.'

1339
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:31,780
'And has Isabella never changed her mind before?'

1340
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:34,099
'But what about your brother?

1341
01:43:34,099 --> 01:43:42,500
Why did he invite her to dance after what
I said?' asked Catherine, feeling very confused.

1342
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:48,699
'My brother makes his own decisions, but his
behaviour does not surprise me.

1343
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:54,730
She is very pretty and that would have been
enough reason for him to have asked her.'

1344
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:59,961
Catherine had no opportunity to speak to Isabella
until the dance had finished and they were

1345
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:02,370
walking round the room arm in arm.

1346
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:07,780
'Dear Catherine, I know you are surprised
that I danced, and now I am exhausted.

1347
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:14,850
But he is very amusing, I must admit, although
I would have preferred to sit still all evening.'

1348
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:19,659
'Why didn't you?' asked Catherine, thinking
of her brother.

1349
01:44:19,659 --> 01:44:25,469
'That would have made me look quite spoiled,
and you know how I hate that kind of behaviour.

1350
01:44:25,469 --> 01:44:28,280
I refused him as long as possible, but he
would not give up.

1351
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:33,280
He said that he would dance with me or with
no one.

1352
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,510
Such nonsense!

1353
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:40,429
Since there would be no peace until I danced
with him, and knowing that your dear brother

1354
01:44:40,429 --> 01:44:46,730
would not want me to sit throughout the evening,
I had to accept his invitation.

1355
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:49,520
He is such a smart-looking young fellow.

1356
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,880
Did you see that every eye was upon us?'

1357
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:58,070
'He is a very handsome man,' Catherine agreed
quietly.

1358
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:02,960
'Oh, yes, I suppose he is very good-looking,
but too proud.

1359
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:08,930
I scolded him about that several times in
my way.'

1360
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:15,710
Catherine was with Isabella in the sitting-room
of the Thorpes' lodgings when her brother

1361
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:21,060
James's second letter arrived from Fullerton;
it contained a summary of his father's kind

1362
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:24,760
arrangements for James and his wife's future
happiness.

1363
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:31,889
As a clergyman, he would be given his father's
living with the salary that went with it,

1364
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:38,199
and he would receive a future inheritance
of equal value, then doubling his yearly salary.

1365
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:45,320
James wrote how grateful he was to his parents
and explained the necessity of waiting between

1366
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:50,760
two and three years before he would have his
parish and he and Isabella could marry, which

1367
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,750
is what he had expected.

1368
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:59,110
Catherine followed her brother's lead and,
feeling very satisfied with her parents' generosity

1369
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:05,030
and good wishes for the young couple, congratulated
Isabella on having everything so pleasantly

1370
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:06,300
settled.

1371
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:12,639
'It is very charming, I am sure,' said Isabella
softly.

1372
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:20,000
'Mr Morland has behaved generously, without
doubt,' added Mrs Thorpe, looking anxiously

1373
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,420
at her daughter.

1374
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:24,690
'I am sure that he would do more if he could.

1375
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:30,810
I am certain that if his fortunes change,
he will do more for you and his son in the

1376
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:31,810
future.

1377
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:39,540
A clergyman's salary is a small amount to
begin on, but you are very modest in your

1378
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:43,270
needs, dear Isabella.'

1379
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:49,310
'Well, as you know, I never think of myself,'
Isabella began, 'but I do not want to injure

1380
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:50,950
my dear James.

1381
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:57,130
Such a small income is hardly enough to pay
for the essential requirements of life.

1382
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:01,639
For myself, that is unimportant; I never think
of myself.

1383
01:47:01,639 --> 01:47:09,960
Anyway, Mr Morland has a right to do what
he likes with his own money.'

1384
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:16,610
Catherine felt hurt by what Isabella was implying
and said, 'I am sure that my father has promised

1385
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:18,250
as much as he can afford.'

1386
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:22,870
Isabella quickly tried to cover up her true
feelings.

1387
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:29,139
'My dear Catherine, you know me well enough
to know that I hate money and would be happy

1388
01:47:29,139 --> 01:47:34,949
with very little, but two or three years is
a long time to wait until your brother and

1389
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:36,480
I can marry.'

1390
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:45,020
The Allens now began the sixth of their eight
weeks in Bath, and Catherine was looking forward

1391
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:49,840
to more opportunities to spend time with both
Eleanor and Henry Tilney.

1392
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:55,730
But on her next visit to Miss Tilney at Milsom
Street, she was disappointed to learn that

1393
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:59,020
the family would be leaving Bath at the end
of the following week.

1394
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:05,350
'I am afraid my father has missed some of
his friends who did not come to Bath this

1395
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:08,469
year,' explained Miss Tilney.

1396
01:48:08,469 --> 01:48:15,660
Catherine was very upset by this news and
wanted to ask Miss Tilney to promise to write,

1397
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:20,940
but before she could make her request, General
Tilney entered the room.

1398
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:28,270
'Well, Miss Morland,' he said to Catherine,
'have you agreed?

1399
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:33,739
We leave Bath a week from Saturday, and if
you will accompany us to Northanger Abbey,

1400
01:48:33,739 --> 01:48:38,699
none of us will have any reason to miss this
place.

1401
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:44,090
We cannot offer you all of the excitement
of a place like Bath, but we will do everything

1402
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:47,190
we can to make your stay agreeable.'

1403
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:49,560
Northanger Abbey!

1404
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:57,540
These were thrilling words to Catherine, and
it was such a flattering invitation.

1405
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:04,300
To have her company so warmly requested!

1406
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:10,139
She thought her heart might burst if she tried
to speak.

1407
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:16,580
A visit to Northanger Abbey held so much promise:
a continued friendship with Eleanor, whom

1408
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:22,980
she greatly admired, and the possibility of
a romance, but that was something she dared

1409
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,050
not mention to anyone.

1410
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:33,150
And in addition to all that, she would be
staying in an ancient abbey and would be able

1411
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:40,369
to explore every damp cellar, every hidden
room, every ruined passage.

1412
01:49:40,369 --> 01:49:45,660
The decayed walls would speak to her and tell
her the stories hidden there.

1413
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:55,320
With a mind so full of excitement about her
stay at Northanger Abbey, Catherine was hardly

1414
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:01,030
aware that two or three days passed without
her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes

1415
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:02,230
at a time.

1416
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:08,489
But one afternoon Isabella sought her out
in the Pump Room and asked her to sit with

1417
01:50:08,489 --> 01:50:14,030
her on her favourite bench between two doors,
where they could see everybody who entered

1418
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:16,550
the room before they were seen.

1419
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:23,090
As the two friends chatted, Catherine noticed
that Isabella's eyes continually turned towards

1420
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:26,690
the entrance as if she were waiting for someone.

1421
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:32,090
Catherine decided to tease her friend a little
and said, 'Don't worry, Isabella.

1422
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:34,560
James will be here soon.'

1423
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:41,270
'Catherine, my dear creature, do not think
that I always want to keep James at my elbow.

1424
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:44,360
It would be awful to always be together.

1425
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:48,840
And so you are going to Northanger Abbey.

1426
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,570
I am very glad for you.

1427
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:59,440
I understand that it is one of the finest
old places in England, and you must write

1428
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,210
and tell me all about it.'

1429
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:03,170
'I will do my best.

1430
01:51:03,170 --> 01:51:05,520
But who are you looking for?

1431
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,480
Are you expecting your sisters?'

1432
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,830
'I am not looking for anybody.

1433
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:14,790
My eyes must be somewhere, and you know my
eyes wander when my thoughts are a hundred

1434
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:15,790
miles away.

1435
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:21,400
Tilney says it is always the case with certain
types of minds.

1436
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,489
But forget about that.

1437
01:51:23,489 --> 01:51:26,050
I have something important to tell you.

1438
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:32,610
I have just had a letter from John, and I
am sure you can guess what he has written

1439
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,610
about.'

1440
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:35,110
'No, I cannot.

1441
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:38,900
Why could I?' asked Catherine innocently.

1442
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,690
'Catherine, don't be naive.

1443
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:43,370
You know that he is head over heels in love
with you.'

1444
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,370
'With me?

1445
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:49,250
Dear Isabella, why would you say such a thing?'

1446
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:57,280
'My sweet Catherine, be honest, and don't
pretend you are not aware of his feelings.

1447
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:02,750
John says in his letter that just before he
left Bath he made it clear that he intended

1448
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:11,050
to propose marriage to you very soon, and
that you encouraged him quite openly.'

1449
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:15,880
'Isabella, I am completely astonished by what
you say.

1450
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,900
I had no idea that your brother was in love
with me, and I certainly did not encourage

1451
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,670
him in any way.

1452
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:28,080
I sincerely swear that no talk of his proposing
marriage to me ever passed between us.

1453
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,080
He must have misunderstood me in some way
because I never thought nor wished for anything

1454
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,080
of this kind from him.

1455
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:47,290
Please explain to him as properly as possible
that I did not intend to deceive him in any

1456
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:55,909
way, but if I could think of one man more
than any other, he is not that person.

1457
01:52:55,909 --> 01:53:01,800
Please don't be angry with me, Isabella, because
we shall, of course, still be sisters-in-law.'

1458
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:12,639
'Yes, yes,' Isabella said blushing, 'but there
are more ways than one of our becoming sisters.

1459
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,590
But what am I talking about?

1460
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:17,730
My mind is wandering again.

1461
01:53:17,730 --> 01:53:22,070
So you are determined not to accept a proposal
from John?'

1462
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:30,090
'I cannot return his love, and I certainly
never meant to encourage him,' insisted Catherine.

1463
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:32,560
'I must say, Catherine, that I agree with
you.

1464
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,270
What would you and he live on?

1465
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:40,400
He has very little money, and it is no good
saying that people can live on love because

1466
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,239
it is just not possible.

1467
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,610
I think John cannot have received my last
letter.'

1468
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:51,929
'And so you do understand what I have said?

1469
01:53:51,929 --> 01:53:54,960
I did not mean to encourage your brother.'

1470
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,570
'Of course I understand,' said Isabella.

1471
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:04,420
'A little harmless flirtation often leads
one person to assume they know another's mind.

1472
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:11,210
I assure you that I am the last person in
the world to judge you severely in such matters.

1473
01:54:11,210 --> 01:54:19,670
Circumstances change; what one means one day,
one may not mean the next.'

1474
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:24,469
'But my opinion of your brother did not change.

1475
01:54:24,469 --> 01:54:28,690
You are describing something that did not
happen.'

1476
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:34,710
Without listening to Catherine, Isabella continued
with her own thoughts.

1477
01:54:34,710 --> 01:54:39,329
'Nobody should rush into an engagement before
knowing what they are doing.

1478
01:54:39,329 --> 01:54:42,730
And young men change their opinions so easily.

1479
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:48,050
Why should a brother's happiness be more important
to me than my friend's?

1480
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:53,020
My advice to you, Catherine, is not to be
in a hurry.

1481
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:59,120
Tilney says people often deceive themselves
about the state of their own heart, and I

1482
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,140
believe that he is right.

1483
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:08,750
Oh, look, here he comes, but he will not see
us here.'

1484
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:14,900
But Captain Tilney walked directly to their
bench and took the seat next to Isabella.

1485
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:22,270
The two of them began whispering together,
making Catherine very uncomfortable and very

1486
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:25,220
jealous for her brother.

1487
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:31,510
Finally she stood and said, 'Isabella, I would
like to join Mrs Allen.

1488
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:33,719
Will you walk with me?'

1489
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:36,949
'You go without me,' Isabella said.

1490
01:55:36,949 --> 01:55:41,429
'I must wait here for my sisters.'

1491
01:55:41,429 --> 01:55:46,929
Catherine could do nothing to persuade Isabella
to leave the bench, and so she found Mrs Allen

1492
01:55:46,929 --> 01:55:48,840
and left the Pump Room.

1493
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:54,950
It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling
in love with Isabella and that her friend

1494
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:57,340
was unconsciously encouraging him.

1495
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:03,590
It had to be an unconscious flirtation because
Isabella was engaged to James, but Catherine

1496
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:08,820
was left confused and worried by her conversations
with Isabella that day.

1497
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:12,480
Why had she talked so much about money?

1498
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:18,880
Why had she been so obviously pleased at seeing
Captain Tilney?

1499
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:24,500
And how did John Thorpe come to the conclusion
that she had encouraged him to fall in love

1500
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,280
with her?

1501
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:37,270
A few days passed and Catherine, although
not allowing herself to suspect Isabella of

1502
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:43,960
improper behaviour, could not help noticing
that her friend seemed an altered creature.

1503
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:49,889
When she was with Catherine and James in the
Allens' or Thorpes' lodgings, she seemed a

1504
01:56:49,889 --> 01:56:55,600
bit dreamy and not quite as full of spirit
and energy as before.

1505
01:56:55,600 --> 01:57:01,780
That alone would not have troubled Catherine,
but when she saw Isabella in the public rooms,

1506
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:07,200
she had to admit that she became much livelier
and flirtatious when Captain Tilney was in

1507
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,679
the room.

1508
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:15,329
Catherine could see that James was confused
and hurt by his fiancee's behaviour, and she

1509
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:21,619
thought that Captain Tilney too was being
treated badly by Isabella.

1510
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:27,550
Surely Isabella had not told him that she
was an engaged woman; otherwise, he would

1511
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:30,610
not have flattered her with so much attention.

1512
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:37,100
Catherine worried so much about the situation
that she finally decided to speak to Henry

1513
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:44,430
Tilney about it, describing what she had observed
and ending by saying, 'I am certain that your

1514
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:51,190
brother must be unaware that Miss Thorpe is
engaged to be married to my brother, James.'

1515
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:56,219
'My brother does know that,' replied Mr Tilney.

1516
01:57:56,219 --> 01:57:58,980
'Does he?' asked Catherine.

1517
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:03,389
'Then why does he pursue Isabella as if she
was unattached?

1518
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:08,500
He will have his heart broken if he falls
in love with her.'

1519
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:15,390
'I am sure that my brother can look after
his own heart,' Henry said with a smile.

1520
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:23,580
'I have told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged,
but he is his own master and will do as he

1521
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:24,580
pleases.'

1522
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:29,960
'But he is giving great pain and anxiety to
my brother.'

1523
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:34,969
'Are you sure that this distress is caused
by Frederick?

1524
01:58:34,969 --> 01:58:41,909
Is it his attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss
Thorpe's reaction to them that gives pain

1525
01:58:41,909 --> 01:58:43,320
to your brother?'

1526
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:46,820
'Is it not the same thing?'

1527
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:51,190
'I think your brother would understand the
difference.

1528
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:57,699
No man is offended by another man's admiration
of the woman he loves; it is the woman only

1529
01:58:57,699 --> 01:59:00,000
who can turn it into a tragedy.'

1530
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,500
'Should I warn James?

1531
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:07,199
Or can you speak to your brother and advise
him to leave Bath?'

1532
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:13,070
'I do not believe that any one of the three
people involved in this situation would thank

1533
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:14,980
us for our advice.

1534
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:21,099
If your brother and Miss Thorpe love each
other, as you are certain they do, they will

1535
01:59:21,099 --> 01:59:24,590
never tease each other beyond what is acceptable
to them both.

1536
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:26,130
Don't worry.

1537
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:32,159
Frederick will not stay long in Bath, and
then your brother and his fiancee will laugh

1538
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:38,099
about poor Captain Tilney's attachment to
the beautiful Isabella.'

1539
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:43,139
Catherine could not argue against Henry's
analysis of the situation, and she decided

1540
01:59:43,139 --> 01:59:45,070
to stop worrying about it.

1541
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:50,579
That evening Isabella and James were at the
Allens' lodgings to say goodbye to Catherine,

1542
01:59:50,579 --> 01:59:57,409
and with relief she saw only affectionate
behaviour between them.

1543
01:59:57,409 --> 02:00:01,780
CHAPTER SEVEN

1544
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:02,780
Disappointment at First Sight

1545
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:10,090
The next morning Catherine was at the Tilneys'
lodgings, ready to begin her journey to Northanger

1546
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:11,550
Abbey.

1547
02:00:11,550 --> 02:00:17,070
She was unusually nervous, wanting to do exactly
what was right to maintain her new friends'

1548
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:18,770
high opinion of her.

1549
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:21,750
But she had no need to worry.

1550
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:28,270
Miss Tilney's good manners and Henry's smile
soon drove away any anxious feelings, and

1551
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:33,170
General Tilney welcomed her very warmly and
looked after her every need.

1552
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:39,099
Even Captain Tilney appeared in the sitting-room
to wish them all a safe journey, although

1553
02:00:39,099 --> 02:00:44,450
Catherine heard him whisper to Eleanor, 'How
glad I shall be when you are all on your way

1554
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:45,550
home.'

1555
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:52,940
Catherine joined Eleanor and a servant inside
one carriage; Henry and General Tilney were

1556
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:55,540
in the front carriage, with Henry driving.

1557
02:00:55,540 --> 02:01:02,170
Finally the journey of thirty miles from Bath
to Northanger Abbey began.

1558
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:08,610
Our heroine relaxed and enjoyed Eleanor's
company as she observed a road that was entirely

1559
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:09,610
new to her.

1560
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:16,480
She looked back at Bath without regret, excited
about being with Eleanor and Henry, and about

1561
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,650
spending time in a real abbey.

1562
02:01:18,650 --> 02:01:25,320
After two hours, which flew by for Catherine,
the carriages stopped for lunch.

1563
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:31,310
Catherine could not help noticing the General's
habit of giving orders and dominating every

1564
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:32,310
conversation.

1565
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:38,350
He gave his opinion about the journey, about
the inn at which they had stopped, the service

1566
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:44,180
of the waiters, the quality of the food, and
even about the weather.

1567
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:49,949
Eleanor and Henry spoke very little when their
father was part of the group, and Catherine

1568
02:01:49,949 --> 02:01:54,540
felt a sense of relief when it was time to
return to the carriages and get away from

1569
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:56,020
General Tilney.

1570
02:01:56,020 --> 02:02:00,150
But the General delighted her with a surprising
suggestion.

1571
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:06,650
'The day is very fine, Miss Morland, and I
think you would see more of this beautiful

1572
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:13,250
countryside if you took my place with Henry
at the top of the front carriage.'

1573
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:22,989
And so Catherine found herself sitting beside
Henry, as happy as any girl who ever existed.

1574
02:02:22,989 --> 02:02:26,200
And Henry drove so well!

1575
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:32,409
He did not swear or congratulate himself on
his ability with horses, and he seemed to

1576
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:36,160
enjoy making conversation with Catherine.

1577
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:41,929
Sitting beside him in his carriage was almost
as good as dancing with him.

1578
02:02:41,929 --> 02:02:46,469
'My sister is very happy that you are coming
to Northanger Abbey as her guest.

1579
02:02:46,469 --> 02:02:53,449
She does not have a true friend in the neighbourhood
and is looking forward to this time with you.'

1580
02:02:53,449 --> 02:02:57,700
'But you are with her most of the time, aren't
you?'

1581
02:02:57,700 --> 02:03:01,640
'Northanger is my home for about half of my
time.

1582
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:07,210
I have my own house in Woodston, which is
nearly twenty miles from my father's house,

1583
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:10,659
and I must spend some of my time there in
my parish.

1584
02:03:10,659 --> 02:03:14,790
Of course I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.'

1585
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,349
'And the Abbey?

1586
02:03:16,349 --> 02:03:19,950
You must be very fond of the Abbey.'

1587
02:03:19,950 --> 02:03:27,980
Henry smiled and said, 'You seem to have formed
a very positive view of Northanger Abbey.'

1588
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:34,369
'Yes, I think I have.

1589
02:03:34,369 --> 02:03:35,369
It is a fine old place, isn't it?

1590
02:03:35,369 --> 02:03:37,349
Like the kind of places one reads about in
Mrs Radcliffe's novels?'

1591
02:03:37,349 --> 02:03:43,869
'And are you prepared to meet the type of
frightening experiences that may occur in

1592
02:03:43,869 --> 02:03:44,869
such houses?

1593
02:03:44,869 --> 02:03:47,949
Do you have a brave heart?

1594
02:03:47,949 --> 02:03:55,890
Are your nerves strong enough for secret rooms
and hidden staircases?'

1595
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:58,210
said Henry in a low, quiet voice.

1596
02:03:58,210 --> 02:03:59,909
'Oh, yes!' cried Catherine.

1597
02:03:59,909 --> 02:04:05,880
'But I will not be easily frightened with
so many people in the house.

1598
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:13,110
We are not returning to it after it has stood
empty for years and no one expects us.

1599
02:04:13,110 --> 02:04:19,920
I have read about that kind of thing happening
in novels, and then mysterious and scary things

1600
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:20,920
occur.'

1601
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:25,139
'No, that is certainly not the case at Northanger.

1602
02:04:25,139 --> 02:04:31,010
We shall not have to feel our way along a
dark hall with only the dying coals of a distant

1603
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:32,620
fire to light our way.

1604
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:40,219
Nor will we have to make our beds on the floor
of a room without windows, doors or furniture.

1605
02:04:40,219 --> 02:04:47,520
I am sure you have read about such circumstances
too in one of your favourite novels,' suggested

1606
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,520
Henry.

1607
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:58,310
'Of course, as is the custom in old houses,'
he continued in his dramatically low voice,

1608
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:03,909
'you will be in a separate part of the house,
away from the rest of the family.

1609
02:05:03,909 --> 02:05:11,920
And when we go to our warm, familiar rooms
at the end of the evening, Dorothy, our ancient

1610
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:21,230
servant, will lead you up a different staircase,
and then along several dark passages, into

1611
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:30,230
an apartment that has not been used since
a very old aunt died in it more than twenty

1612
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:31,280
years ago.

1613
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,369
Will that frighten you?

1614
02:05:33,369 --> 02:05:43,830
'Will you be content in your large room with
very high ceilings and very little light?

1615
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:51,730
The walls in this room are hidden behind dark,
heavy tapestries and the bed is covered in

1616
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:54,410
material appropriate for a funeral.

1617
02:05:54,410 --> 02:05:58,500
Will your blood run cold when you enter?

1618
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:04,730
Will you be happy to spend the night there
alone, with nobody close enough to hear you

1619
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:09,730
if you shout, or even scream?'

1620
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:20,080
'But that will not happen to me, I am sure,'
said Catherine in a trembling voice.

1621
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:23,949
'You are describing what happens in novels.'

1622
02:06:23,949 --> 02:06:27,260
'But what are they based on?

1623
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:32,340
Think about the furniture you will find in
your apartment.

1624
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:40,890
Not tables, wardrobes or drawers, but in a
dark corner you might see a broken violin

1625
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:49,920
or a tall black cupboard from several centuries
ago, and over the fireplace an oil painting

1626
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:58,030
of a handsome military man, whose eyes seem
to follow you round the room.

1627
02:06:58,030 --> 02:07:05,369
'And Dorothy, before leaving you, tells you
that you will be alone in this part of the

1628
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:10,780
house, with only the ghosts of the past to
keep you company.

1629
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:17,809
With these parting words, she disappears down
the dark hall, and you listen until you can

1630
02:07:17,809 --> 02:07:19,949
no longer hear her footsteps.

1631
02:07:19,949 --> 02:07:23,288
You hurry to the door, wanting to lock it,
but there is no lock or key.'

1632
02:07:23,288 --> 02:07:24,288
'Oh, Mr Tilney, how frightening!

1633
02:07:24,288 --> 02:07:32,610
It is like a scene from Udolpho!

1634
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:39,690
But it cannot really happen to me.

1635
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:48,790
I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy,
and there are no ghosts at Northanger Abbey,

1636
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:50,610
are there?

1637
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:54,239
What else might happen?'

1638
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:59,560
'I think you will feel frightened on your
first night, but nothing unusual will happen

1639
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:01,400
to you.

1640
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,900
Not on that night.

1641
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:07,690
You will go to bed and get a few hours of
disturbed sleep.

1642
02:08:07,690 --> 02:08:13,510
But on your third night, there will probably
be a violent storm.

1643
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:19,180
The thunder will be so loud and so frequent
that the whole abbey will shake.

1644
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:26,841
A terrible wind will accompany the noise,
and when the lightning flashes, you will see

1645
02:08:26,841 --> 02:08:30,290
movement behind the heavy tapestries.

1646
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:38,110
Because you are naturally curious, you will
get out of bed to investigate and behind a

1647
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:45,290
tear in one of the tapestries, you will discover
a small, secret door.

1648
02:08:45,290 --> 02:08:51,159
With your lamp in your hand, you will pass
into a small dark room.'

1649
02:08:51,159 --> 02:08:54,489
'No, I could not go into the room!

1650
02:08:54,489 --> 02:08:56,570
I would be too frightened!'

1651
02:08:56,570 --> 02:09:05,050
'But you would enter because Dorothy has told
you about a secret underground passage between

1652
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:10,880
your apartment and the church of St Anthony,
less than two miles away.

1653
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:15,020
Could you resist such an adventure?

1654
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:16,020
No!

1655
02:09:16,020 --> 02:09:22,540
You will go into the small, dark room, which
leads to several more tiny rooms.

1656
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:31,199
You will see a sharp knife in one room, drops
of blood in another and, in a third, chains

1657
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:33,020
and a whip.

1658
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:40,670
'Finally you find a large, old-fashioned cupboard,
and when you unlock its doors, you find drawers,

1659
02:09:40,670 --> 02:09:45,790
one of which contains many mysterious sheets
of paper.

1660
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:50,080
You hurry back to your room with this treasure
and begin to read:

1661
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:55,530
You have found the diary of Matilda, a poor,
unfortunate girl.

1662
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:58,449
Have pity on me and...

1663
02:09:58,449 --> 02:10:04,250
Your lamp suddenly goes out and leaves you
in total darkness.'

1664
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,619
'Oh, no!'

1665
02:10:05,619 --> 02:10:06,800
cries Catherine.

1666
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,619
'And then what?

1667
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:10,439
Please, go on!'

1668
02:10:10,439 --> 02:10:16,179
But Henry could not continue telling the story
without smiling, and Catherine at last understood

1669
02:10:16,179 --> 02:10:20,000
that he was amusing himself by frightening
her.

1670
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,929
Catherine felt ashamed of desperately wanting
to hear more of the story, and told herself

1671
02:10:25,929 --> 02:10:27,610
to remember where she was.

1672
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:34,170
'Mr Tilney, you are a good story-teller, but
you have not alarmed me.

1673
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:40,550
Your sister would never put me in a room like
the one you have described.

1674
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:47,310
I am not afraid of anything at Northanger
Abbey,' insisted our heroine.

1675
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:54,520
Just then the Abbey came into view and Catherine
found that she was more than a little disappointed.

1676
02:10:54,520 --> 02:11:01,090
Parts of the building were very low and she
could not even see an ancient chimney.

1677
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:08,619
But it was a real abbey, and she was delighted
to be there, even when she saw that the hallway

1678
02:11:08,619 --> 02:11:14,480
and informal sitting-room were very modern
and decorated with elegant furniture.

1679
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:19,429
She had to admit that this was not what she
had wished for.

1680
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:26,540
She had dreamed of entering a scene from Udolpho,
but instead found herself in a richly decorated,

1681
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:29,929
beautiful, comfortable home.

1682
02:11:29,929 --> 02:11:35,199
Soon she was taken to her own room by Eleanor,
who asked her to be ready for dinner in twenty-five

1683
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:36,199
minutes.

1684
02:11:36,199 --> 02:11:41,270
This room was nothing like the one that Henry
had described.

1685
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:46,500
There was pretty paper on the walls and a
lovely carpet on the floor.

1686
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:51,930
Everything, in fact, was very handsome, comfortable
and even cheerful.

1687
02:11:51,930 --> 02:11:58,179
She was determined to change her clothes quickly
and be early for dinner because she did not

1688
02:11:58,179 --> 02:12:00,800
want to risk upsetting General Tilney.

1689
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:08,260
But suddenly she noticed a large wooden chest
at one side of the fireplace and she forgot

1690
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:10,350
about the General and the need to hurry.

1691
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:11,350
'This is very strange!

1692
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:14,500
I did not expect such a sight as this!

1693
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:17,480
What an enormous chest!

1694
02:12:17,480 --> 02:12:25,130
Why is it hidden in this corner, almost out
of sight?

1695
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:28,909
I should not, but I will look inside.

1696
02:12:28,909 --> 02:12:33,920
I must do it now while there is still light
outside.

1697
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,449
If I wait until evening my candle may go out.'

1698
02:12:38,449 --> 02:12:44,380
Without hesitating, Catherine tried to open
the old oak chest, but had trouble with the

1699
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:47,900
lock, which was made of ancient looking, dull
silver.

1700
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:54,730
The handles at each end were broken, perhaps
by some awful violence, and in the centre

1701
02:12:54,730 --> 02:13:01,230
of the lid there was a silver plate with some
mysterious writing which she could not understand.

1702
02:13:01,230 --> 02:13:11,010
Could it say Tilney in a foreign alphabet,
or did the chest not originally belong to

1703
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:12,150
the family?

1704
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:17,929
By what strange events could it have become
theirs?

1705
02:13:17,929 --> 02:13:22,960
Catherine's curiosity grew by the second and
she became more and more determined to open

1706
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,960
the chest.

1707
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:29,810
With trembling hands, she had just managed
to turn the lock and lift the heavy lid a

1708
02:13:29,810 --> 02:13:33,010
few centimetres when a servant knocked on
the door.

1709
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:38,680
Catherine dropped the lid immediately and
it came down with a tremendous bang.

1710
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:42,290
'Miss Tilney has sent me, miss.

1711
02:13:42,290 --> 02:13:47,900
Do you need any help with dressing for dinner?'
asked the servant.

1712
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:53,310
This kind offer brought Catherine to her senses
and reminded her of what she should be doing

1713
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,310
at that moment.

1714
02:13:54,310 --> 02:14:00,400
She dismissed the servant and rapidly changed
her dress, although her eyes kept returning

1715
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:01,400
to the chest.

1716
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:07,750
She was ready so quickly that she believed
she had time to examine the chest again.

1717
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:14,900
She hurried to the corner and, with all her
strength, threw back the lid.

1718
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:21,630
She was astonished to discover a beautiful,
new white blanket, folded neatly and resting

1719
02:14:21,630 --> 02:14:24,920
at the bottom of the chest, and nothing more.

1720
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:30,449
Catherine was staring at the blanket when
Miss Tilney, hoping that her friend would

1721
02:14:30,449 --> 02:14:32,679
be ready for dinner, entered the room.

1722
02:14:32,679 --> 02:14:40,750
'It is an odd old chest, isn't it?' said Miss
Tilney, as Catherine hastily closed the chest

1723
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:43,760
and turned away from her friend's eyes.

1724
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:48,520
Our heroine was blushing and feeling ashamed
of her wild imagination.

1725
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:56,559
'It is impossible to say how long that chest
has been in our family,' continued Miss Tilney.

1726
02:14:56,559 --> 02:15:02,280
'I do not know why it was put in this room,
but I have left it here because it is handy

1727
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:03,630
for blankets and sheets.

1728
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:08,880
And in that corner it is out of the way.'

1729
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:15,090
Catherine could not speak, but made herself
calm down and hurry down the stairs with Eleanor

1730
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:18,750
to join Henry and General Tilney in the dining-room.

1731
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:24,230
The General insisted on punctuality and was
looking at his watch as the two young ladies

1732
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:25,520
entered the room.

1733
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:35,440
He violently pulled the bell beside the fireplace
and shouted, 'Dinner to be on the table immediately!'

1734
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:41,309
Catherine felt extremely nervous as she took
her place at the table, worried about offending

1735
02:15:41,309 --> 02:15:44,290
the General and cursing her own interest in
old chests.

1736
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:51,170
The General scolded his daughter for making
their guest hurry down the stairs, and then

1737
02:15:51,170 --> 02:15:53,960
recovered his politeness.

1738
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:58,809
Catherine was distressed at having caused
Eleanor any discomfort, but the General was

1739
02:15:58,809 --> 02:16:04,480
so kind and attentive towards her that, with
this and a healthy appetite, Catherine soon

1740
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:10,270
recovered her peace of mind and began to enjoy
being at Northanger Abbey; she actually felt

1741
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:14,260
a very positive sense of happiness.

1742
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:22,619
The dining-room was large and elegant, with
a very grand table and a number of servants

1743
02:16:22,619 --> 02:16:24,829
attending to the diners' needs.

1744
02:16:24,829 --> 02:16:30,270
'This is a beautiful room,' Catherine commented.

1745
02:16:30,270 --> 02:16:34,300
'It is a good size,' agreed the General.

1746
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:38,689
'I believe that a large dining-room is necessary
in a house like this.

1747
02:16:38,689 --> 02:16:45,540
But I suppose you are used to much grander
dining-rooms at home and at Mr Allen's house.'

1748
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:50,319
'No, not at all,' was Catherine's honest answer.

1749
02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:55,700
'I have never seen such a large dining-room
in my entire life.'

1750
02:16:55,700 --> 02:17:03,030
The General's mood brightened when he heard
this, but he politely said, 'I am sure that

1751
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:05,200
there is more comfort in a smaller dining-room.

1752
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:13,740
I am sure that Mr Allen's house has everything
in the correct size for perfect happiness.'

1753
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:21,559
Before the party retired for the night, a
violent storm started outside, and as Catherine

1754
02:17:21,559 --> 02:17:27,380
reached the door to her room, she listened
to the wind and rain with sensations of wonder.

1755
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:34,389
The night made her think of the horrible scenes
which Mrs Radcliffe's buildings had witnessed.

1756
02:17:34,389 --> 02:17:40,569
She knew that in a house like Northanger Abbey,
which was so modern in many ways and so securely

1757
02:17:40,569 --> 02:17:47,269
guarded, she had nothing to fear, and so,
after noticing that Eleanor's apartment was

1758
02:17:47,269 --> 02:17:56,620
very close to hers, she entered her room with
a reasonably strong heart and steady nerves.

1759
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:02,960
Catherine looked across the room and saw the
window curtains move, and so she forced herself

1760
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:10,590
to step boldly forward, and while softly whistling
a little tune, she courageously looked behind

1761
02:18:10,590 --> 02:18:14,010
each curtain and found nothing unusual.

1762
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:20,330
Then she glanced at the chest beside the fireplace
and laughed at herself for worrying about

1763
02:18:20,330 --> 02:18:22,830
anything in this very pleasant room.

1764
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:31,270
'I will take my time getting ready for bed,
and I will not worry if the fire goes out.'

1765
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:36,269
Catherine felt satisfied with her own determination
to be brave and normal.

1766
02:18:36,269 --> 02:18:42,019
She happily prepared herself for bed and watched
the fire die away, but just as she was ready

1767
02:18:42,019 --> 02:18:48,859
to climb into bed she spied a tall, old-fashioned
black cupboard, which she had not noticed

1768
02:18:48,859 --> 02:18:55,480
earlier and which looked like the cupboard
Henry had described in his fictional room.

1769
02:18:55,480 --> 02:19:01,950
Had he, in fact, been talking about this particular
cupboard?

1770
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:04,960
Catherine took her candle and examined it
closely.

1771
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:10,940
It was very handsome, black with gold handles,
and very old.

1772
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:15,819
The key was in the door, inviting her to look
inside.

1773
02:19:15,819 --> 02:19:22,210
So, placing the candle very cautiously on
a chair, she seized the key and tried with

1774
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:25,889
all her strength to turn it, but it would
not move.

1775
02:19:25,889 --> 02:19:34,171
Alarmed, but not discouraged, she tried it
another way and the key turned in the lock,

1776
02:19:34,171 --> 02:19:36,859
but the door would not open.

1777
02:19:36,859 --> 02:19:41,630
She paused a moment, listening to the wind
roaring down the chimney and the rain beating

1778
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:47,840
against the windows, and everything seemed
to warn her not to open this mysterious cupboard.

1779
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:55,400
But Catherine knew she would not be able to
sleep until she had seen what was hidden within.

1780
02:19:55,400 --> 02:20:01,200
She tried the key again, moving it in different
directions until the door suddenly opened;

1781
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:06,649
Catherine's heart leapt at such a thrilling
victory.

1782
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:13,580
Now she saw a variety of drawers of different
sizes, and she bravely began to open them

1783
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:18,580
and examine the interiors; each was equally
empty!

1784
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:25,100
But Catherine had read enough novels to know
that such cupboards often had secret, hidden

1785
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:29,680
sections, and so her search continued, and
she was successful.

1786
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:36,370
By opening a door behind the first set of
drawers, Catherine discovered a roll of papers

1787
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:41,149
that had been pushed back into the furthest
part of the cupboard.

1788
02:20:41,149 --> 02:20:47,851
Her heart trembled, her knees shook and her
cheek grew pale.

1789
02:20:47,851 --> 02:20:54,560
With an unsteady hand she seized the precious
treasure and was determined to read every

1790
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:57,270
line before she attempted to rest.

1791
02:20:57,270 --> 02:21:04,700
Could it be the diary of Matilda, the young
woman Henry had told her about?

1792
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:12,020
But then something horrible happened: Catherine's
candle was blown out by the wind from the

1793
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:17,060
chimney, and she was left in total darkness.

1794
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:21,180
She heard footsteps outside her room and a
door banged shut.

1795
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:27,590
By now there was a cold sweat on Catherine's
forehead and she was trembling from head to

1796
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:34,450
foot; the papers fell from her hand as she
jumped into her bed and hid beneath the blankets.

1797
02:21:34,450 --> 02:21:42,360
To close her eyes in sleep was impossible;
her thoughts were going in every direction:

1798
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:46,970
Had Henry intended her to find Matilda's diary?

1799
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:50,011
How long had it been hidden in the cupboard?

1800
02:21:50,011 --> 02:21:54,810
Would she be the first person to discover
its secrets?

1801
02:21:54,810 --> 02:22:00,410
She was determined to read the diary, which
she was sure she had found, as soon as there

1802
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:02,560
was enough sunlight to see.

1803
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:11,100
Hour after hour passed and Catherine could
do nothing but listen to the terrible storm,

1804
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:19,740
which seemed to be warning her of hidden dangers,
and pray that morning would come quickly.

1805
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:28,470
A servant entered Catherine's bedroom at eight
o'clock the next morning and opened the curtains.

1806
02:22:28,470 --> 02:22:34,271
As soon as she was alone again, Catherine
leapt from her bed and gathered up the sheets

1807
02:22:34,271 --> 02:22:36,270
of paper she had left on the floor.

1808
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:41,980
Then she jumped back into bed to enjoy the
luxury of discovering Matilda's secrets while

1809
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,550
resting on her pillow.

1810
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:48,990
Her greedy eyes glanced rapidly over one of
the pages.

1811
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:53,760
She was surprised by what she found and quickly
looked at several more pages.

1812
02:22:53,760 --> 02:23:06,280
All of them contained household lists of laundry
items: shirts, socks, underwear, gloves, ties;

1813
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:16,160
or lists of household purchases: writing paper,
pens, hair powder, shoes and string.

1814
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:23,649
These lists and nothing more were the secret
documents that had filled her with excitement

1815
02:23:23,649 --> 02:23:27,880
and robbed her of half her night's rest!

1816
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:32,319
She blushed to think that she had learned
nothing from her experience with the chest

1817
02:23:32,319 --> 02:23:34,430
beside the fireplace.

1818
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:41,390
How could she imagine that she would find
a family secret in a guest bedroom?

1819
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:46,140
Catherine hurried to get ready for breakfast,
hoping that Henry Tilney would never know

1820
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:52,930
that she had spent her first day at Northanger
Abbey behaving like a fool.

1821
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:55,150
CHAPTER EIGHT

1822
02:23:55,150 --> 02:23:57,960
A Gothic Interpretation of Reality

1823
02:23:57,960 --> 02:24:06,460
Catherine was extremely impressed by the elegant
breakfast table, and she made a pretty comment

1824
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:08,710
about the beautiful plates and cups.

1825
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:14,800
'I am pleased that you approve of my choice,'
General Tilney responded.

1826
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:20,960
'These dishes were manufactured in this county,
and I believe the set is as fine as anything

1827
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,550
from the continent.

1828
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:30,311
In fact, I hope that soon I will have the
opportunity of selecting another set of dishes

1829
02:24:30,311 --> 02:24:37,580
from the same company, although this time
not for my own dining-room.'

1830
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:43,069
Catherine was probably the only one of the
party who did not understand what the General

1831
02:24:43,069 --> 02:24:45,560
was hinting at.

1832
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:50,870
Soon after breakfast Henry left them for a
three-day visit to Woodston, where he had

1833
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:51,939
parish work to do.

1834
02:24:51,939 --> 02:24:59,170
As the other three watched him go, Catherine
asked his father, 'Is Woodston a pretty place?'

1835
02:24:59,170 --> 02:25:04,550
'Over the last few years, I have tried to
make the house and gardens a suitable place

1836
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:07,880
for my son,' General Tilney explained.

1837
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:12,720
'It is a family living, and I want Henry to
be happy there.

1838
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:19,689
Of course, his clergyman's salary is not important,
although he could easily live on it.

1839
02:25:19,689 --> 02:25:26,859
What is important for any son is to have a
job, to be employed in worthwhile work.

1840
02:25:26,859 --> 02:25:34,620
Even Frederick, my eldest son, who will inherit
one of the largest pieces of private property

1841
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:38,430
in the country, has his profession.

1842
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:43,670
I am sure that your father, Miss Morland,
would agree with me.'

1843
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:49,050
Catherine could not answer for her father,
but she was very impressed with everything

1844
02:25:49,050 --> 02:25:51,870
General Tilney had just said.

1845
02:25:51,870 --> 02:25:57,649
'Now, last night you mentioned that you would
like to see the rest of Northanger Abbey.

1846
02:25:57,649 --> 02:26:03,050
It would be my privilege to show you the house
and the gardens if you can be ready to go

1847
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:04,529
out in five minutes.

1848
02:26:04,529 --> 02:26:09,069
I will wait for you young ladies at the front
door.'

1849
02:26:09,069 --> 02:26:14,891
Catherine would have preferred to go around
the house with only Eleanor, and her disappointment

1850
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:16,190
showed on her face.

1851
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:22,430
'I hope you do not mind joining my father,'
said Eleanor, almost apologetically.

1852
02:26:22,430 --> 02:26:27,380
'He always walks out at this time of day.'

1853
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:32,080
Catherine thought it was odd that the General
always took his walk so early.

1854
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:35,630
Neither her father nor Mr Allen did so.

1855
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:39,100
It made her wonder about her host.

1856
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:43,630
She certainly wanted to see the house, but
she had to admit that she was not very interested

1857
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:46,660
in seeing the gardens.

1858
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:52,740
Nevertheless, when Catherine was outside,
being guided around the exterior of the Abbey,

1859
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:57,300
she was more impressed than she could ever
have predicted.

1860
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:03,170
She admired the size, the design, the beauty
of the buildings, as well as the wonderful

1861
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:05,290
gardens.

1862
02:27:05,290 --> 02:27:11,580
General Tilney considered her reaction and
all of her comments both pleasing and appropriate,

1863
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:17,080
especially when she made it clear that nothing
in Fullerton, not even on Mr Allen's land,

1864
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:21,720
could compare to what she was seeing at Northanger
Abbey.

1865
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:26,010
Finally the General said, 'Here is a handy
door.

1866
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:31,780
I think you young ladies are probably ready
to go inside and get warm.'

1867
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:37,819
'But I will take our guest down this narrow
path,' said Eleanor.

1868
02:27:37,819 --> 02:27:40,230
'It is my favourite walk.

1869
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:42,890
Will you join us, Father?'

1870
02:27:42,890 --> 02:27:47,260
'No, Eleanor, it is cold and damp along that
path.

1871
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:53,550
I will go across the park and meet you later,
but don't show our guest around the inside

1872
02:27:53,550 --> 02:27:59,979
of the house until I join you.'

1873
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:06,140
As the young ladies walked along, Miss Tilney
said, 'This was my mother's favourite walk

1874
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:08,729
and brings back memories of her.'

1875
02:28:08,729 --> 02:28:13,470
'I am surprised, then, that the General would
not enter it.

1876
02:28:13,470 --> 02:28:17,220
Your mother's death must have caused great
grief and distress.'

1877
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:25,180
'Yes, and it causes more pain every year.

1878
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:33,060
I was only thirteen when she died, too young
to understand that I had lost a constant friend

1879
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:37,060
whose love and advice I could rely on.'

1880
02:28:37,060 --> 02:28:42,450
Catherine wanted to know more about Mrs Tilney
and eagerly asked many questions: 'Was your

1881
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:43,450
mother a charming woman?

1882
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:46,260
Is there a picture of her in the Abbey?

1883
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:52,570
Did this dark path reflect something sad in
her?'

1884
02:28:52,570 --> 02:28:58,610
As Catherine listened to Eleanor's answers,
she came to the conclusion that General and

1885
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:01,910
Mrs Tilney had had an unhappy marriage.

1886
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:07,521
He did not love her favourite path, so how
could he have loved her?

1887
02:29:07,521 --> 02:29:13,810
And there was something in his handsome face
that told Catherine he had not behaved well

1888
02:29:13,810 --> 02:29:15,069
to his wife.

1889
02:29:15,069 --> 02:29:20,000
'Is the picture of her in your father's room?'

1890
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,860
was Catherine's final question.

1891
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:27,480
'No,' answered Eleanor quietly.

1892
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:34,080
'My father was never satisfied with the picture
and would not hang it in the sitting-room

1893
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,569
or in his apartment.

1894
02:29:35,569 --> 02:29:41,560
After Mother's death, I found it and hung
it in my bedroom.

1895
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:47,939
I will show it to you if you would like to
see it.'

1896
02:29:47,939 --> 02:29:53,021
Catherine believed this was one more proof
that the General did not love his wife and

1897
02:29:53,021 --> 02:29:56,380
must have been extremely cruel to her!

1898
02:29:56,380 --> 02:30:02,250
She knew this kind of selfish, unfeeling man
from her novels, and as he led her around

1899
02:30:02,250 --> 02:30:07,500
the house, she came to the conclusion that
General Tilney was the type of man that Mrs

1900
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:15,040
Radcliffe often wrote about - someone with
dark, dangerous secrets, a man who lived by

1901
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,189
his own rules.

1902
02:30:17,189 --> 02:30:23,729
The General proudly pointed out the many modern
improvements he had made to Northanger Abbey

1903
02:30:23,729 --> 02:30:29,420
as they walked through the living rooms, the
kitchens, the offices and the storerooms.

1904
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:35,149
Everything had been done to make the house
both comfortable and efficient to run.

1905
02:30:35,149 --> 02:30:41,750
But Catherine wondered if there was anything
left of the original fifteenth-century building.

1906
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:47,740
Had every ancient treasure been swept away
for the sake of domestic economy?

1907
02:30:47,740 --> 02:30:54,851
They finally returned to the chief staircase
and walked up to examine three large guest

1908
02:30:54,851 --> 02:30:58,770
rooms which had been decorated in the last
five years.

1909
02:30:58,770 --> 02:31:07,500
'We hope to have other guests from Fullerton
staying here in the future,' said the General,

1910
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:12,630
and Catherine was pleased by this kind thought
for her family.

1911
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:18,859
At the end of this grand hall, they reached
a set of large doors which Eleanor began to

1912
02:31:18,859 --> 02:31:19,859
open.

1913
02:31:19,859 --> 02:31:21,279
'No, Eleanor.

1914
02:31:21,279 --> 02:31:22,850
Miss Morland has seen enough.

1915
02:31:22,850 --> 02:31:25,399
There is nothing else worthy of her notice.

1916
02:31:25,399 --> 02:31:30,180
We will retire to the library for a cup of
tea after so much exercise.'

1917
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:37,779
Catherine watched as the heavy doors were
closed and believed that the General had excluded

1918
02:31:37,779 --> 02:31:41,109
her from the most interesting part of the
house.

1919
02:31:41,109 --> 02:31:47,871
When she was alone with Eleanor, Catherine
learned that the room in which Mrs Tilney

1920
02:31:47,871 --> 02:31:52,290
had died was behind those doors.

1921
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:56,800
She imagined that the General's guilt, not
grief, kept him away from that room.

1922
02:31:56,800 --> 02:32:04,880
'Has the room been kept as it was when your
mother died?' asked Catherine eagerly.

1923
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:15,050
'Yes,' answered Eleanor, 'even after nine
years it is still exactly as she left it.'

1924
02:32:15,050 --> 02:32:18,810
'I suppose that you were with her when she
died?'

1925
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:26,800
'No,' said Eleanor sadly, 'I was unfortunately
away from home.

1926
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,320
Her illness was sudden and short.

1927
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:35,930
It had ended before I could return.'

1928
02:32:35,930 --> 02:32:38,310
Horrible pictures came into Catherine's head.

1929
02:32:38,310 --> 02:32:42,180
Could Henry's father have caused his wife's
death?

1930
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:50,170
That evening ended quietly and as the young
ladies retired, General Tilney said that he

1931
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:55,069
had to spend several hours in his office looking
over some important papers.

1932
02:32:55,069 --> 02:33:00,689
Catherine would not let herself believe that
the General had business to take care of;

1933
02:33:00,689 --> 02:33:05,479
she thought there was a deeper reason for
his late hours, something that could only

1934
02:33:05,479 --> 02:33:10,729
be done when the rest of the household was
asleep.

1935
02:33:10,729 --> 02:33:17,939
Catherine analysed what she believed were
the facts: Mrs Tilney's illness was very sudden;

1936
02:33:17,939 --> 02:33:25,729
her daughter was away from home at the time,
and probably her sons were too; General Tilney

1937
02:33:25,729 --> 02:33:28,630
was a jealous and cruel man.

1938
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:32,960
What was her conclusion?

1939
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:42,250
Perhaps Mrs Tilney was alive, shut up for
unknown reasons, and receiving a nightly supply

1940
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:46,910
of coarse food from a husband who had never
loved her.

1941
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:52,630
The poor woman must be a prisoner in the oldest
part of the Abbey, the part that Catherine

1942
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:56,060
was not permitted to see.

1943
02:33:56,060 --> 02:34:01,100
She worried that her conclusions were too
bold, but then she persuaded herself that

1944
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:04,700
all the evidence supported her opinion.

1945
02:34:04,700 --> 02:34:14,950
Catherine was determined to find out more
about the tragic life of Mrs Tilney, and she

1946
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:19,729
watched for an opportunity to visit the mysterious
rooms that the General did not want her to

1947
02:34:19,729 --> 02:34:21,130
see.

1948
02:34:21,130 --> 02:34:26,600
Unfortunately Sunday was a busy day and Catherine
had to accompany the Tilneys to church.

1949
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:32,770
She sat with the family in their usual seats
near the front of the church and stared directly

1950
02:34:32,770 --> 02:34:38,540
at a very elegant monument which had been
built in memory of Mrs Tilney, although Catherine

1951
02:34:38,540 --> 02:34:44,271
did not accept this as proof of the poor woman's
death.

1952
02:34:44,271 --> 02:34:50,270
Our heroine's eyes filled with tears as she
read the words recorded on the monument, which

1953
02:34:50,270 --> 02:34:56,770
described Mrs Tilney as a wonderful mother,
a loyal friend, a generous neighbour, and,

1954
02:34:56,770 --> 02:35:04,280
especially, as a loving and much-loved wife.

1955
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:11,590
She looked to her left and was not surprised
to see that General Tilney remained unmoved;

1956
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:19,080
this unemotional attitude, and the proud look
on his face, strengthened Catherine's belief

1957
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:23,100
that he had in some way been his wife's destroyer.

1958
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:25,590
She knew this type of man.

1959
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:32,670
She could remember dozens of such cruel animals
from her novels - men who went from one crime

1960
02:35:32,670 --> 02:35:39,170
to another, murdering whoever they chose,
without any feelings of guilt or regret.

1961
02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:44,560
On the next day, Catherine had some time alone.

1962
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:50,381
Henry would not return until Tuesday, and
both General Tilney and Eleanor were busy

1963
02:35:50,381 --> 02:35:56,770
with their household duties, giving Catherine
time to carry out her plan.

1964
02:35:56,770 --> 02:36:04,060
She would go through the forbidden doors alone
and search for proof of the General's cruelty.

1965
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:09,950
She was sure she would find something: perhaps
the veil Mrs Tilney had worn to cover her

1966
02:36:09,950 --> 02:36:16,510
desperate sadness or the last few paragraphs
in her journal, which she had written in a

1967
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:17,750
trembling hand.

1968
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:24,181
Catherine knew the way and walked quickly
and quietly through the heavy doors and on

1969
02:36:24,181 --> 02:36:26,640
to Mrs Tilney's room.

1970
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:30,410
She turned the key, opened the door and was
in the room.

1971
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:35,820
But it was several minutes before she could
take another step.

1972
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:40,390
What kind of horrible scene did she face?

1973
02:36:40,390 --> 02:36:43,359
What surprise took her breath away?

1974
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:49,689
It was a clean, beautiful, modern, lady's
bedroom.

1975
02:36:49,689 --> 02:36:55,050
It was filled with handsome furniture, and
the bright afternoon sun poured through two

1976
02:36:55,050 --> 02:37:00,240
large windows which looked out on the most
attractive flower gardens.

1977
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:06,490
Catherine's common sense told her that this
had been a cheerful place; she was filled

1978
02:37:06,490 --> 02:37:08,600
with shame.

1979
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:11,040
How could she have assumed so much?

1980
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:17,149
She was sick of exploring and analysing; she
only wanted to return quickly and safely to

1981
02:37:17,149 --> 02:37:21,540
her own bedroom and to keep all her suspicions
to herself.

1982
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:26,490
But just as she stepped towards the door,
she heard footsteps, and as she entered the

1983
02:37:26,490 --> 02:37:30,950
hall again, she found herself face to face
with Henry Tilney.

1984
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:32,340
'Mr Tilney!'

1985
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:33,730
Catherine cried.

1986
02:37:33,730 --> 02:37:38,600
'Why did you come up that staircase?'

1987
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:42,280
'I always use that staircase.

1988
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:44,990
It is the easiest route from the stables to
my apartment.

1989
02:37:44,990 --> 02:37:47,960
And why shouldn't I use it?

1990
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:52,870
But may I ask why you were using that staircase?

1991
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:56,450
It does not connect with the passage to your
room.'

1992
02:37:56,450 --> 02:38:03,979
'I have been to see your mother's room,' Catherine
explained, blushing deeply.

1993
02:38:03,979 --> 02:38:04,979
'Really?

1994
02:38:04,979 --> 02:38:08,300
Is there anything extraordinary to see there?'

1995
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:12,740
'No, nothing at all,' said Catherine.

1996
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:16,600
Then she quickly added, 'I thought you were
not coming back until tomorrow.'

1997
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:21,510
'I finished my business earlier than expected.

1998
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:23,569
You look pale.

1999
02:38:23,569 --> 02:38:33,569
Did I alarm you by running so fast up those
stairs?'

2000
02:38:33,569 --> 02:38:39,560
'Oh, no.

2001
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:40,560
And did you have good weather for your ride?'

2002
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:41,560
'Well, yes.

2003
02:38:41,560 --> 02:38:44,040
But has Eleanor ignored you and left you to
find your way into all the rooms in the house

2004
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:45,040
by yourself?'

2005
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,350
'Oh, no, don't say that.

2006
02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:56,420
She showed me most of the house on Saturday,
and we were coming into these rooms, but then,'

2007
02:38:56,420 --> 02:38:59,880
whispered Catherine, 'then your father stopped
us.'

2008
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:04,521
'Have you looked into all of the rooms in
this part of the house?'

2009
02:39:04,521 --> 02:39:08,150
'No, I only wanted to see...

2010
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:09,960
Isn't it late?

2011
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:16,470
I must hurry and get dressed for dinner,'
said Catherine nervously.

2012
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:22,271
'It is only a quarter past four,' said Henry
as they walked along the passage.

2013
02:39:22,271 --> 02:39:28,149
For the first time in their acquaintance,
Catherine wished to leave him, but he continued

2014
02:39:28,149 --> 02:39:29,149
chatting.

2015
02:39:29,149 --> 02:39:31,580
'My mother's room is very attractive, isn't
it?

2016
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:35,460
Large and cheerful, with such a wonderful
view.

2017
02:39:35,460 --> 02:39:39,110
I am surprised that Eleanor does not use it
for herself.

2018
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:43,670
She sent you to look at it, I suppose.'

2019
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:48,700
'No,' said Catherine without adding any explanation.

2020
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:54,800
'So it was your own decision to visit my mother's
room.

2021
02:39:54,800 --> 02:40:00,460
Since there is nothing out of the ordinary
there, I assume you went there to honour my

2022
02:40:00,460 --> 02:40:02,350
mother's memory.

2023
02:40:02,350 --> 02:40:10,460
I am sure that Eleanor has told you that the
world never saw a better woman... but I still

2024
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:12,990
cannot understand the reason for your visit.

2025
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:19,240
What else did my sister say to make you curious
about Mother's room?'

2026
02:40:19,240 --> 02:40:31,710
Slowly and with some hesitation, Catherine
said, 'She said that her dying was very sudden,

2027
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:43,000
and that none of you were at home at the time,
and I thought, perhaps, your father had not

2028
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,510
been very fond of her.'

2029
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:52,890
'And from this little information, you have
come to the conclusion that my mother was

2030
02:40:52,890 --> 02:40:55,359
badly treated in some way?'

2031
02:40:55,359 --> 02:41:05,240
He continued, with cold eyes fixed on Catherine,
'My mother's illness, which ended in her death,

2032
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:09,729
was sudden, but she had suffered from the
same illness for years.

2033
02:41:09,729 --> 02:41:17,170
Her doctors, very respected, capable medical
men, were called and looked after her until

2034
02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:19,290
she died on the fifth day.

2035
02:41:19,290 --> 02:41:27,910
Frederick and I were at home and visited her
repeatedly; she received every possible attention

2036
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:29,020
which we could offer.'

2037
02:41:29,020 --> 02:41:36,830
'But was your father,' said Catherine, 'equally
attentive during her illness?

2038
02:41:36,830 --> 02:41:41,720
Was he full of grief and sorrow when she died?'

2039
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:46,790
'Miss Morland, you have misjudged my father.

2040
02:41:46,790 --> 02:41:52,430
He loved my mother as well as he could, and
although I know that he was not the easiest

2041
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:59,480
man to live with, he valued her highly and
sincerely, and he was truly, if not permanently,

2042
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:02,090
affected by her death.'

2043
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:07,270
'I am very glad to hear that,' Catherine began.

2044
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:11,510
'It would have been very shocking otherwise!'

2045
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:20,010
'If I understand what you are implying, you
had come to a conclusion that is too horrible

2046
02:42:20,010 --> 02:42:22,260
for me to put into words.

2047
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:26,950
What have you been basing your wild suspicions
on?

2048
02:42:26,950 --> 02:42:34,290
Do we not live in a civilised society where
laws and customs guide us?

2049
02:42:34,290 --> 02:42:41,069
Do you not know us well enough to accept us
as part of that society?

2050
02:42:41,069 --> 02:42:46,100
We are not characters in a Gothic novel, Miss
Morland.'

2051
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:54,450
They had reached the end of the passage, and
with tears of shame our heroine ran off to

2052
02:42:54,450 --> 02:42:56,590
her own room.

2053
02:42:56,590 --> 02:43:02,830
She hid there, considering every disappointment
that she now might have to face.

2054
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:07,640
She was terribly humbled and she cried bitter
tears.

2055
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:11,340
Would General Tilney learn what she had imagined?

2056
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:16,160
Would she lose Eleanor's friendship and possibly
Henry's love?

2057
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:23,090
She hated herself more than she could express,
but when the clock struck five, she knew that

2058
02:43:23,090 --> 02:43:29,790
she had to appear for dinner although both
her heart and spirit were broken.

2059
02:43:29,790 --> 02:43:34,130
Henry was more polite than ever, seeming to
know that Catherine was in need of a kind

2060
02:43:34,130 --> 02:43:36,680
word and careful attention.

2061
02:43:36,680 --> 02:43:41,450
Gradually Catherine began to feel better,
and she started to hope that her foolishness

2062
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:45,130
had not cost her all of Henry's friendship.

2063
02:43:45,130 --> 02:43:52,153
She had arrived at Northanger Abbey hoping
to be frightened, and she had willingly turned

2064
02:43:52,153 --> 02:43:56,810
what she saw and heard into a tragedy which
could be traced back to the pages of the Gothic

2065
02:43:56,810 --> 02:43:59,120
novels she loved to read.

2066
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:07,210
Charming as Mrs Radcliffe's books were, it
was not in them perhaps that human nature,

2067
02:44:07,210 --> 02:44:11,840
at least in the middle counties of England,
could be looked for and understood.

2068
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:17,970
Maybe Mrs Radcliffe and her fellow novelists
understood the character of the people beside

2069
02:44:17,970 --> 02:44:24,410
the lakes and in the pine forests of the continent,
but in the central part of England murders

2070
02:44:24,410 --> 02:44:32,000
were uncommon, servants were not slaves, and
neither poison nor sleeping pills could be

2071
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:38,290
bought at a local chemist's, like potatoes
at a grocer's.

2072
02:44:38,290 --> 02:44:42,860
She now believed that there was a mixture
of good and evil in the English character

2073
02:44:42,860 --> 02:44:47,240
rather than the black and white described
in her Gothic novels.

2074
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:54,819
With these thoughts in mind, Catherine decided
that she would use her good sense in the future,

2075
02:44:54,819 --> 02:45:00,050
and because of Henry's continued kindness
and his unwillingness to refer to what had

2076
02:45:00,050 --> 02:45:04,430
happened, she was able to be happy again.

2077
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:09,120
She listened to Henry with the greatest attention,
knowing that she would be improved by what

2078
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,510
she learned from him.

2079
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:16,650
She still trembled when she glanced at the
chest or the black cupboard in her bedroom,

2080
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:24,180
but she admitted that these reminders of her
past foolishness were probably good for her.

2081
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:26,591
CHAPTER NINE

2082
02:45:26,591 --> 02:45:29,800
Distressing Letters

2083
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:37,640
When Catherine was completely calm again at
Northanger Abbey, she began to wonder why

2084
02:45:37,640 --> 02:45:39,990
she had not heard anything from Isabella.

2085
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:45,939
She was impatient for news from Bath, and
she wanted to know that her friend and her

2086
02:45:45,939 --> 02:45:50,460
brother, James, continued on the best possible
terms.

2087
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:56,319
Isabella had promised to write and had assured
Catherine that she was always strict about

2088
02:45:56,319 --> 02:45:58,899
carrying out her promises.

2089
02:45:58,899 --> 02:46:06,420
This, Catherine thought, made it very strange
that she had not received a letter from Isabella.

2090
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:13,210
Then, on her tenth morning at the Abbey, Catherine
found a letter beside her place at the breakfast

2091
02:46:13,210 --> 02:46:14,210
table.

2092
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:18,530
She opened it and found that it was from James:

2093
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:21,090
Dear Catherine,

2094
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:27,479
This is not a letter that I want to write,
but I think it is my duty to tell you that

2095
02:46:27,479 --> 02:46:30,660
everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe
and me.

2096
02:46:30,660 --> 02:46:37,899
I left her and Bath yesterday, and will never
see either of them again.

2097
02:46:37,899 --> 02:46:42,840
You will learn the details from a different
source, but I hope you will trust that my

2098
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:46,640
only mistake was to believe that my love was
returned.

2099
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:50,630
Thank God I learned the truth in time.

2100
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:53,090
She has made me miserable forever.

2101
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:59,100
I hope that your visit to Northanger Abbey
finishes before Captain Tilney and Isabella

2102
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:01,319
announce their engagement.

2103
02:47:01,319 --> 02:47:07,830
I have been a fool, believing her words rather
than the evidence in front of my eyes.

2104
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:12,250
I wish that I had never met her.

2105
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:18,950
Dearest Catherine, be careful how you give
your heart.

2106
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:23,279
Catherine sat at the breakfast table with
tears running down her cheeks, and with Eleanor

2107
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:26,399
and Henry wondering how they could help her.

2108
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:31,660
Fortunately, General Tilney was hidden behind
his newspaper and took no notice of his guest

2109
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:33,700
that morning.

2110
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:39,290
Unable to eat, Catherine hurried off to the
sitting-room to be alone as soon as it was

2111
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:41,040
politely possible.

2112
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:46,560
Eleanor and Henry recognised that their friend
was distressed and were very concerned for

2113
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:52,000
her, and so, after half an hour, they quietly
approached her.

2114
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:56,910
'I hope you have not had bad news from Fullerton.

2115
02:47:56,910 --> 02:48:00,510
Is your family all well?'

2116
02:48:00,510 --> 02:48:02,360
Eleanor asked gently.

2117
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:06,070
'They are all well, thank you.

2118
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:08,920
The letter was from my brother at Oxford.'

2119
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:18,470
Everyone was quiet for a few minutes, but
then Catherine cried, 'I do not think I shall

2120
02:48:18,470 --> 02:48:20,990
ever wish for a letter again!

2121
02:48:20,990 --> 02:48:26,640
Poor James is so unhappy, and you will soon
know why.'

2122
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:31,710
'I am sure he is glad to have such a kind,
affectionate sister.

2123
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:36,540
You will be a comfort to him if he is in any
distress,' replied Henry kindly.

2124
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:42,510
'I have one favour to beg,' Catherine said
in a troubled voice.

2125
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:50,870
'If your brother, Captain Tilney, is coming
here, could you please give me notice so that

2126
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:54,660
I may go away.'

2127
02:48:54,660 --> 02:48:55,660
'Frederick?

2128
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:59,820
Has this anything to do with your friend,
Miss Thorpe?'

2129
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:01,130
asked Henry.

2130
02:49:01,130 --> 02:49:04,540
'How quickly you have guessed,' cried Catherine.

2131
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:13,050
'And now I understand why she has not written
to me, but please read what my brother has

2132
02:49:13,050 --> 02:49:14,050
written.'

2133
02:49:14,050 --> 02:49:21,520
Both Henry and Eleanor read James Morland's
letter, and Henry said, 'I am very sorry that

2134
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:28,300
anyone you love is unhappy, but I cannot believe
that Frederick ever intended to propose marriage

2135
02:49:28,300 --> 02:49:30,109
to Miss Thorpe.'

2136
02:49:30,109 --> 02:49:37,460
Then Eleanor asked, 'What can you tell me
about Miss Thorpe's family?

2137
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:39,779
Does she have any fortune?'

2138
02:49:39,779 --> 02:49:45,330
'Her mother seems a good sort of person, and
her father is dead.

2139
02:49:45,330 --> 02:49:50,044
They are not a wealthy family, and I believe
Isabella has no fortune at all, but that would

2140
02:49:50,044 --> 02:49:51,044
not matter to your family.

2141
02:49:51,044 --> 02:49:58,520
Your father told me the other day that he
only valued money because it allowed him to

2142
02:49:58,520 --> 02:50:02,450
guarantee the happiness of his children.'

2143
02:50:02,450 --> 02:50:05,080
Henry and Eleanor exchanged a look.

2144
02:50:05,080 --> 02:50:12,990
Then Eleanor said, 'I can imagine Frederick
flirting with a girl like Miss Thorpe, but

2145
02:50:12,990 --> 02:50:16,540
he would not respect her for treating her
own fiance so badly.

2146
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:23,601
He has never found a woman good enough to
love, and this situation would not make him

2147
02:50:23,601 --> 02:50:25,600
love Miss Thorpe.'

2148
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:30,109
'You might be wrong this time, my dear sister,'
said Henry.

2149
02:50:30,109 --> 02:50:34,399
'Surely Miss Thorpe would not break off her
engagement to Mr Morland before securing a

2150
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:36,739
promise from the other gentleman.

2151
02:50:36,739 --> 02:50:45,450
You may delight in such a sister-in-law: open,
honest, lively, with strong affections and

2152
02:50:45,450 --> 02:50:49,200
nothing artificial about her emotions.'

2153
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:59,050
'That kind of sister-in-law would be delightful,'
said Eleanor, smiling at her brother.

2154
02:50:59,050 --> 02:51:05,050
'But perhaps,' observed Catherine, 'although
she has behaved so badly to my family, she

2155
02:51:05,050 --> 02:51:06,630
may behave better to yours.

2156
02:51:06,630 --> 02:51:13,000
Now that she has got the man she really likes
and wanted, she may learn to be faithful.'

2157
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:20,359
'I trust she will be faithful to our brother,'
replied Henry, 'unless she meets someone with

2158
02:51:20,359 --> 02:51:24,240
more charm, or even a better fortune.

2159
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:27,920
I think that is Frederick's only chance of
escape.'

2160
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:30,110
'You are right.

2161
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:38,120
I think ambition was her only motive when
falling in love.

2162
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:47,390
I remember when she found out what my father
would do for her and James, she was so obviously

2163
02:51:47,390 --> 02:51:48,390
disappointed.

2164
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:58,140
I have never been so deceived by anyone in
my entire life, but that does not compare

2165
02:51:58,140 --> 02:52:01,540
to poor James's feelings towards her.'

2166
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:09,220
'We must pity your brother at present,' Henry
said, 'but we must not underestimate your

2167
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:10,850
loss.

2168
02:52:10,850 --> 02:52:18,949
You no longer have a close friend to open
your heart to, to depend on, to learn from.

2169
02:52:18,949 --> 02:52:24,100
You will feel the loss greatly, won't you?'

2170
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:34,580
Catherine thought for a moment and then said,
'No, to tell the truth, I am hurt and cannot

2171
02:52:34,580 --> 02:52:35,950
still love her.

2172
02:52:35,950 --> 02:52:42,700
I will never hear from her or see her again,
but I do not feel such grief as I would have

2173
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:43,700
thought.'

2174
02:52:43,700 --> 02:52:50,960
To Catherine's surprise, this conversation
greatly lifted her spirits.

2175
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:59,200
From this time, the subject of the affair
between Isabella Thorpe and Captain Frederick

2176
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:05,910
Tilney was frequently discussed and analysed
by the three young people at Northanger Abbey.

2177
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:10,200
Catherine learned, with some surprise, that
Eleanor and Henry were in perfect agreement

2178
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:16,390
about one thing: their father may not approve
of Isabella's behaviour, but his greatest

2179
02:53:16,390 --> 02:53:22,870
objection to her as a wife for his elder son
would be that she was not socially well connected

2180
02:53:22,870 --> 02:53:25,680
and she had no money.

2181
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:31,140
Such thoughts made Catherine think with some
alarm about herself.

2182
02:53:31,140 --> 02:53:37,430
She was as socially insignificant and as poor
as Isabella, and if the heir to the Tilney

2183
02:53:37,430 --> 02:53:43,820
fortune could not propose to a woman without
money, would his younger brother ever gain

2184
02:53:43,820 --> 02:53:47,680
his father's permission to marry someone like
her?

2185
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:52,930
This worried Catherine, but she thought about
General Tilney's generous attitude towards

2186
02:53:52,930 --> 02:53:56,439
her and the special attention she always received
from him.

2187
02:53:56,439 --> 02:54:03,399
Added to this, more than once she had heard
him dismiss the idea that money was the most

2188
02:54:03,399 --> 02:54:05,850
important thing in the world.

2189
02:54:05,850 --> 02:54:13,510
During one of their discussions, Catherine
said, 'Mr Tilney, shouldn't you tell your

2190
02:54:13,510 --> 02:54:16,380
father how Isabella has behaved towards my
brother?

2191
02:54:16,380 --> 02:54:22,830
Then he will be able to judge her by her character
rather than by her situation in life.'

2192
02:54:22,830 --> 02:54:24,891
'No,' replied Henry.

2193
02:54:24,891 --> 02:54:32,300
'Frederick must tell his own story if he asks
my father for permission to marry Miss Thorpe.

2194
02:54:32,300 --> 02:54:37,930
But I must emphasise to you that I do not
believe that will ever happen.'

2195
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:45,880
The household went about its business with
no news from Captain Tilney, and so the General,

2196
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:50,720
who knew nothing about his elder son's connection
to Miss Thorpe, was able to spend his time

2197
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:54,859
and energy making Catherine's time at Northanger
pass pleasantly.

2198
02:54:54,859 --> 02:55:00,610
He often expressed his anxiety about this
task, worrying that she would be bored with

2199
02:55:00,610 --> 02:55:02,340
the quiet life they led.

2200
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:07,550
He wished that there were more young people
in the area, or more types of entertainment.

2201
02:55:07,550 --> 02:55:14,450
He talked about hosting a large dinner party
or even a ball, but it was a dead time of

2202
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:18,630
year and many of their friends were not at
present in the neighbourhood.

2203
02:55:18,630 --> 02:55:24,541
His worries ended one morning, at last, when
he told Henry that he would bring Eleanor

2204
02:55:24,541 --> 02:55:31,040
and Miss Morland to dinner at his son's house
the next time Henry was at Woodston.

2205
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:38,340
'And when do you think, sir, I may look forward
to this pleasure?' asked Henry.

2206
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:44,810
'I am going to Woodston on Monday and will
have business there for at least two or three

2207
02:55:44,810 --> 02:55:45,880
days.'

2208
02:55:45,880 --> 02:55:51,790
'Well, we will take our chances on one of
those days,' General Tilney answered.

2209
02:55:51,790 --> 02:55:54,810
'There is no need to make a firm date.

2210
02:55:54,810 --> 02:55:58,641
We do not expect anything fancy, just whatever
you have in the house will be enough.

2211
02:55:58,641 --> 02:56:07,910
We know that a single man cannot be expected
to produce anything grand.

2212
02:56:07,910 --> 02:56:09,689
What about Wednesday?

2213
02:56:09,689 --> 02:56:14,010
Yes, you may expect us early on Wednesday.'

2214
02:56:14,010 --> 02:56:24,000
A ball itself could not have pleased Catherine
more than a visit to Henry's house in Woodston,

2215
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:29,580
and her heart was full of joy with the idea
of becoming acquainted with the place.

2216
02:56:29,580 --> 02:56:35,700
Nevertheless she was both surprised and a
little sad when Henry found her and Eleanor

2217
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:41,250
in the sitting-room an hour later and said,
'I am here, young ladies, to say that our

2218
02:56:41,250 --> 02:56:44,310
pleasures in this world must always be paid
for.

2219
02:56:44,310 --> 02:56:47,960
Look at me at this moment.

2220
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:53,811
Because I look forward to seeing you both
in my own house on Wednesday, I must leave

2221
02:56:53,811 --> 02:57:00,600
now, two days before I had intended to go,
and I would much rather stay.'

2222
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:04,880
'But must you go?'

2223
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:07,420
Catherine asked with a very sad face.

2224
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:09,430
'Yes, I must!

2225
02:57:09,430 --> 02:57:15,990
My old cook will be frightened half to death
about preparing a dinner for my father.

2226
02:57:15,990 --> 02:57:19,239
She will need as much time as possible to
prepare everything.'

2227
02:57:19,239 --> 02:57:27,229
'But the General told you not to give yourself
any trouble,' said Catherine.

2228
02:57:27,229 --> 02:57:34,330
Henry only smiled, and as he left he said,
'I wish I could reason like you.'

2229
02:57:34,330 --> 02:57:40,439
Catherine always doubted her judgement and
agreed with Henry's, so she had to think about

2230
02:57:40,439 --> 02:57:42,069
this.

2231
02:57:42,069 --> 02:57:46,609
How could people understand each other if
they said one thing so positively and meant

2232
02:57:46,609 --> 02:57:48,170
something else?

2233
02:57:48,170 --> 02:57:55,640
Only Henry and Eleanor could interpret what
their father's words really meant.

2234
02:57:55,640 --> 02:58:02,090
The hours from Saturday to Wednesday passed
very slowly for Catherine.

2235
02:58:02,090 --> 02:58:05,180
Everything was quieter, even rather dull,
without Henry.

2236
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:10,819
Then she worried that Captain Tilney might
arrive, and she could not imagine acting politely

2237
02:58:10,819 --> 02:58:12,029
towards him.

2238
02:58:12,029 --> 02:58:18,061
She thought a lot about her brother, and felt
sad at having lost Isabella's friendship.

2239
02:58:18,061 --> 02:58:24,271
Her only feeling towards Northanger Abbey
itself was now one of embarrassment, and the

2240
02:58:24,271 --> 02:58:30,430
idea of a country parish with a comfortable
house was much more attractive to her.

2241
02:58:30,430 --> 02:58:36,330
Finally Wednesday arrived and by ten o'clock
the carriage left the Abbey with General Tilney,

2242
02:58:36,330 --> 02:58:42,739
Eleanor and Catherine inside, and after an
agreeable drive of about twenty miles they

2243
02:58:42,739 --> 02:58:47,130
entered Woodston, a large village in pleasant
countryside.

2244
02:58:47,130 --> 02:58:54,029
Catherine looked around and believed that
she preferred it to any place she had ever

2245
02:58:54,029 --> 02:58:55,029
seen.

2246
02:58:55,029 --> 02:59:01,149
They drove through the village, looking at
the neat houses, charming shops and tidy gardens

2247
02:59:01,149 --> 02:59:05,330
until they reached Henry's house at the far
end of the main street.

2248
02:59:05,330 --> 02:59:14,029
It was a newly built, large stone house, and
as they drove up to the door, Henry, with

2249
02:59:14,029 --> 02:59:18,840
three or four energetic dogs, waited at the
door to welcome them.

2250
02:59:18,840 --> 02:59:24,080
When they were inside, the General, who seemed
to think that Catherine would be disappointed

2251
02:59:24,080 --> 02:59:27,540
by the house, began to defend it.

2252
02:59:27,540 --> 02:59:31,720
'We are not calling it a good house.

2253
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:37,859
It does not compare to Northanger or to Fullerton,
but we feel that it is decent, and not inferior

2254
02:59:37,859 --> 02:59:40,229
to the houses round here.

2255
02:59:40,229 --> 02:59:45,920
I believe that there are very few clergymen
in England with a house half so good.'

2256
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:52,100
When the party entered the sitting-room, which
was still without furniture, Catherine was

2257
02:59:52,100 --> 02:59:56,730
delighted and her comments satisfied even
the General.

2258
02:59:56,730 --> 03:00:00,180
'What a prettily shaped room!'

2259
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:01,180
she cried.

2260
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:02,430
'It is the nicest room I have ever seen.

2261
03:00:02,430 --> 03:00:05,700
And it has a beautiful view.

2262
03:00:05,700 --> 03:00:11,319
You must decorate it soon, Mr Tilney, and
enjoy it.'

2263
03:00:11,319 --> 03:00:17,500
'I believe it needs a lady's touch,' said
the General with a satisfied smile.

2264
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:25,350
'Well, if it were my house, I would always
sit in this room,' Catherine declared.

2265
03:00:25,350 --> 03:00:31,350
Henry entertained his guests with a wander
round his garden, a look at the stables, and

2266
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:33,060
then a walk through the village.

2267
03:00:33,060 --> 03:00:39,440
At four they returned to the house for a delicious
meal of many courses, which the General seemed

2268
03:00:39,440 --> 03:00:41,540
extremely pleased by.

2269
03:00:41,540 --> 03:00:47,490
At six o'clock, after General Tilney had had
his coffee, the carriage was waiting at the

2270
03:00:47,490 --> 03:00:51,080
front door for the return trip to Northanger
Abbey.

2271
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:56,020
Catherine felt certain that she could not
possibly misinterpret the General's behaviour

2272
03:00:56,020 --> 03:00:57,120
that day.

2273
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:03,899
It seemed clear that he expected her to become
his daughter-in-law; she only wished that

2274
03:01:03,899 --> 03:01:09,149
she could feel as confident about his son's
plans.

2275
03:01:09,149 --> 03:01:16,400
The next morning brought the following unexpected
letter from Isabella:

2276
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:18,210
Bath, April

2277
03:01:18,210 --> 03:01:20,910
My dearest Catherine,

2278
03:01:20,910 --> 03:01:28,120
I was delighted to receive your two kind letters
and I have a thousand apologies to make for

2279
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:30,320
not answering them sooner.

2280
03:01:30,320 --> 03:01:36,470
I am quite ashamed at being so idle, but in
this horrible place, one can find time for

2281
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:37,470
nothing.

2282
03:01:37,470 --> 03:01:42,520
Thank God we leave here tomorrow, so please
direct your next letter to me at my home,

2283
03:01:42,520 --> 03:01:44,490
and write to me soon!

2284
03:01:44,490 --> 03:01:48,399
I have not found any pleasure in Bath since
you left.

2285
03:01:48,399 --> 03:01:53,600
There is so much dust in the air, and everyone
that I care about has left.

2286
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:58,739
I believe that if I could see you, I could
put up with everything else because you are

2287
03:01:58,739 --> 03:02:01,540
more precious to me than anybody can imagine.

2288
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:07,399
I am worried about your dear brother, who
I have not heard from since his return to

2289
03:02:07,399 --> 03:02:08,399
Oxford.

2290
03:02:08,399 --> 03:02:14,610
I fear that there has been some misunderstanding
between us, and I am confident that you will

2291
03:02:14,610 --> 03:02:21,989
make my position plain to him: he is the only
man I ever did or ever could love.

2292
03:02:21,989 --> 03:02:26,750
I trust you to make that perfectly clear to
him.

2293
03:02:26,750 --> 03:02:32,420
The spring fashions are in the shops, and
the hats are simply the most awful you can

2294
03:02:32,420 --> 03:02:33,420
imagine.

2295
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:40,040
I hope you are having a nice time at Northanger
Abbey, but I am afraid you never think of

2296
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:41,040
me.

2297
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:46,229
I will not say anything against the family
you are with, although I could if I wanted

2298
03:02:46,229 --> 03:02:48,000
to be spiteful or ungenerous.

2299
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:54,380
I have learned that young men change their
minds from one day to the next, and I am happy

2300
03:02:54,380 --> 03:03:00,790
to say that the young man whom I dislike more
than all others has left Bath.

2301
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:06,149
You will guess that I mean Captain Tilney,
who, as you remember, was constantly following

2302
03:03:06,149 --> 03:03:09,529
me and teasing me in the most flirtatious
manner.

2303
03:03:09,529 --> 03:03:13,800
But I know men too well to be fooled by him.

2304
03:03:13,800 --> 03:03:19,189
He returned to his duties in the army two
days ago, and I hope that I will never be

2305
03:03:19,189 --> 03:03:20,810
bothered by him again.

2306
03:03:20,810 --> 03:03:27,020
In the last two days he was in Bath he was
always flirting with Charlotte Davis, a rather

2307
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:28,200
plain girl.

2308
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:32,939
I refused to take any notice of him when I
saw him on the street after that.

2309
03:03:32,939 --> 03:03:37,399
What a contrast there is between him and your
brother!

2310
03:03:37,399 --> 03:03:40,850
Please send me news of dear James.

2311
03:03:40,850 --> 03:03:45,950
He seemed so unhappy when he left Bath, perhaps
he had a cold or something else that made

2312
03:03:45,950 --> 03:03:47,030
him feel unwell.

2313
03:03:47,030 --> 03:03:52,970
I would write to him myself but I have lost
his address in Oxford and I worry that he

2314
03:03:52,970 --> 03:03:55,540
misinterpreted my behaviour in some way.

2315
03:03:55,540 --> 03:04:00,000
Ask him to write to me and we will sort everything
out.

2316
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:06,229
I have not been going out in the evenings,
except that I went to the theatre last night

2317
03:04:06,229 --> 03:04:12,640
with the Hodges, after they teased me about
staying in night after night.

2318
03:04:12,640 --> 03:04:15,600
I had to show them that I was not staying
in because Captain Tilney had gone.

2319
03:04:15,600 --> 03:04:20,620
I went out to show everyone that I have a
good spirit of my own.

2320
03:04:20,620 --> 03:04:23,409
Do you remember Anne Mitchell?

2321
03:04:23,409 --> 03:04:27,860
She was wearing a hat like the one I bought
with you, but it did not suit her.

2322
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:34,710
I suppose it went with my odd face, at least
Tilney told me so at the time and said every

2323
03:04:34,710 --> 03:04:35,930
eye was looking at me.

2324
03:04:35,930 --> 03:04:40,720
But, of course, he is the last man whose opinion
I would take any notice of.

2325
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:43,591
I wear purple all the time now.

2326
03:04:43,591 --> 03:04:49,470
I know it is not the best colour for me, but
it is your dear brother's favourite colour.

2327
03:04:49,470 --> 03:04:57,790
Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine,
in writing to him and to me.

2328
03:04:57,790 --> 03:05:02,580
Your friend forever...

2329
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:09,620
How could anyone be so false, so dishonest?

2330
03:05:09,620 --> 03:05:15,989
Not even kind-hearted Catherine could be fooled
by so many lies and so much self-interest.

2331
03:05:15,989 --> 03:05:23,140
In fact, Catherine was ashamed of Isabella
and ashamed of ever having loved her.

2332
03:05:23,140 --> 03:05:28,899
Her excuses for her treatment of James were
empty, and Catherine could not believe that

2333
03:05:28,899 --> 03:05:32,910
she had been asked to write to her brother
on Isabella's behalf.

2334
03:05:32,910 --> 03:05:38,620
He had suffered enough and would never hear
Isabella's name mentioned by his sister.

2335
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:40,609
Never again!

2336
03:05:40,609 --> 03:05:46,270
When Henry returned from Woodston, Catherine
told him and Eleanor about the letter.

2337
03:05:46,270 --> 03:05:51,550
'Your own brother has had a lucky escape,'
Catherine said sincerely.

2338
03:05:51,550 --> 03:05:57,320
'And for me, I wish that I had never met Isabella
Thorpe.

2339
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:02,410
I can see that she never had any true feelings
for either James or for me.'

2340
03:06:02,410 --> 03:06:07,750
'It will soon seem that you never had met,'
Henry said.

2341
03:06:07,750 --> 03:06:12,580
'But please explain one more thing for me,'
Catherine replied.

2342
03:06:12,580 --> 03:06:17,230
'She was obviously pursuing your brother but
did not succeed.

2343
03:06:17,230 --> 03:06:21,100
But I do not understand Captain Tilney's behaviour
in this affair.

2344
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:28,479
Why did he flirt with her and make her quarrel
with my brother, and then walk away from her?'

2345
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:35,760
'I cannot explain my brother's motives, but
like Miss Thorpe, he thinks very highly of

2346
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:36,760
himself.

2347
03:06:36,760 --> 03:06:42,890
Until this time, he has not been hurt by his
flirtations,' explained Henry.

2348
03:06:42,890 --> 03:06:47,319
'I believe that he never really cared for
your friend.'

2349
03:06:47,319 --> 03:06:53,689
'Well, I disapprove of this sort of behaviour,'
Catherine said quite angrily, 'and I must

2350
03:06:53,689 --> 03:06:56,431
say that I do not like Captain Tilney at all.

2351
03:06:56,431 --> 03:07:04,240
I suppose that no great harm has been done
to me or to my brother, but what would have

2352
03:07:04,240 --> 03:07:08,820
happened if Isabella had lost her heart to
him?'

2353
03:07:08,820 --> 03:07:14,380
'But we must first assume that Isabella had
a heart to lose, which would make her a different

2354
03:07:14,380 --> 03:07:19,950
young woman, and so she would have received
very different treatment from my brother,'

2355
03:07:19,950 --> 03:07:21,340
replied Henry.

2356
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:26,260
'It is good that you defend your brother,'
said Catherine.

2357
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:31,760
'And you must defend your brother's position
and understand that he should not feel sad

2358
03:07:31,760 --> 03:07:33,330
about losing Miss Thorpe.

2359
03:07:33,330 --> 03:07:36,149
He has had a lucky escape.

2360
03:07:36,149 --> 03:07:40,540
Your own sense of what is right and wrong
is so strong that you have not even thought

2361
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:42,840
of revenge against your friend.

2362
03:07:42,840 --> 03:07:46,989
I admire you very much for that.'

2363
03:07:46,989 --> 03:07:51,180
Henry's admiration was enough to make Catherine
feel better in any situation.

2364
03:07:51,180 --> 03:07:57,710
She was determined not to think that Captain
Tilney was completely evil; she decided she

2365
03:07:57,710 --> 03:08:01,819
would never answer Isabella's letter, and
she tried not to think about what had happened

2366
03:08:01,819 --> 03:08:06,250
in Bath between those two ever again.

2367
03:08:06,250 --> 03:08:09,580
CHAPTER TEN

2368
03:08:09,580 --> 03:08:16,340
A Perfect Visit Ends in Disaster

2369
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:21,200
A few days later, the General announced that
he had to go to London on business for a week.

2370
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:27,000
As he was leaving, he said, 'Miss Morland,
more than anything, I regret that I will be

2371
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:30,100
robbed of your charming company for a whole
week.

2372
03:08:30,100 --> 03:08:34,970
I have instructed Eleanor and Henry to look
after you, and I hope you will tell them if

2373
03:08:34,970 --> 03:08:40,521
there is anything they can do to make your
stay more amusing or more comfortable.'

2374
03:08:40,521 --> 03:08:48,240
The General's departure gave Catherine her
first understanding of the principle that

2375
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:51,779
a loss may sometimes be a gain.

2376
03:08:51,779 --> 03:08:58,029
The three young people had much more fun without
General Tilney in control of their lives.

2377
03:08:58,029 --> 03:09:04,750
Every meal was a scene of enjoyment and ease,
and every day was spent as the three wished.

2378
03:09:04,750 --> 03:09:11,310
These delightful days made our heroine love
the place and the people more and more.

2379
03:09:11,310 --> 03:09:17,820
Catherine was now in the fourth week of her
visit and had never been happier.

2380
03:09:17,820 --> 03:09:23,360
But the fact that she had been there for almost
a month made her wonder whether it was polite

2381
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:29,490
to stay any longer, or whether she should
suggest choosing a date for her return to

2382
03:09:29,490 --> 03:09:30,490
Fullerton.

2383
03:09:30,490 --> 03:09:35,870
Although it was an unpleasant subject, Catherine
took the first opportunity to speak to Eleanor

2384
03:09:35,870 --> 03:09:37,130
about it.

2385
03:09:37,130 --> 03:09:44,390
'Dear Eleanor, I think I must return home
soon.'

2386
03:09:44,390 --> 03:09:51,330
'Oh, Catherine,' Eleanor began with feeling,
'I had hoped for the pleasure of your company

2387
03:09:51,330 --> 03:09:53,601
for a much longer time.

2388
03:09:53,601 --> 03:10:00,060
If your parents knew how much we enjoyed having
you here, do you think they might allow you

2389
03:10:00,060 --> 03:10:03,520
to stay a bit longer?'

2390
03:10:03,520 --> 03:10:08,830
'Oh, my parents are in no hurry to have me
at home.

2391
03:10:08,830 --> 03:10:12,180
They are always satisfied if I am happy.'

2392
03:10:12,180 --> 03:10:19,160
'Then why are you in such a hurry to leave
us?' asked Eleanor with a worried look on

2393
03:10:19,160 --> 03:10:20,160
her face.

2394
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:23,690
'But I have been here so long!'

2395
03:10:23,690 --> 03:10:24,800
Catherine cried.

2396
03:10:24,800 --> 03:10:32,960
'If you have grown tired of being here, I
cannot urge you to stay,' Eleanor said sadly.

2397
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:35,920
'Oh, no, you misunderstand me!

2398
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:45,250
For my own pleasure, I would be very happy
to stay another four weeks, but I do not wish

2399
03:10:45,250 --> 03:10:46,470
to become a nuisance.'

2400
03:10:46,470 --> 03:10:48,189
'Catherine, it is settled then.

2401
03:10:48,189 --> 03:10:50,189
You must not think of leaving us.

2402
03:10:50,189 --> 03:10:55,440
Henry and I will be very sad to lose you,
so you must stay as long as possible.'

2403
03:10:55,440 --> 03:11:03,400
Eleanor's desire for her to stay longer at
Northanger Abbey was so sincere that it confirmed

2404
03:11:03,400 --> 03:11:09,870
Catherine's secret belief that the Tilneys
hoped she would belong to their family one

2405
03:11:09,870 --> 03:11:11,260
day.

2406
03:11:11,260 --> 03:11:18,330
Henry's obligations at Woodston took him away
during his father's absence, but Catherine

2407
03:11:18,330 --> 03:11:22,810
continued to be happy because it gave her
time to get to know Eleanor better and to

2408
03:11:22,810 --> 03:11:24,950
enjoy her company.

2409
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:29,380
On the evening of Henry's departure, the young
ladies were still sitting and chatting at

2410
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:35,729
the dinner table at eleven o'clock, a rather
late hour at the Abbey.

2411
03:11:35,729 --> 03:11:39,580
Then as they walked to their bedrooms, they
heard a carriage arrive outside, and in the

2412
03:11:39,580 --> 03:11:43,240
next moment they heard the loud noise of the
doorbell.

2413
03:11:43,240 --> 03:11:46,630
'Who could that be at this late hour?'

2414
03:11:46,630 --> 03:11:47,830
wondered Eleanor.

2415
03:11:47,830 --> 03:11:49,250
'It must be Frederick.

2416
03:11:49,250 --> 03:11:54,920
I will say good night, dear Catherine, and
go downstairs to welcome him.'

2417
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:59,880
Catherine went into her room, thinking about
meeting Captain Tilney the next morning at

2418
03:11:59,880 --> 03:12:01,320
breakfast.

2419
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:07,870
She hoped that he would not mention Isabella's
name, or the part he had played in her brother's

2420
03:12:07,870 --> 03:12:08,930
unhappiness.

2421
03:12:08,930 --> 03:12:14,140
She thought she could be polite to him as
long as no one talked about Bath.

2422
03:12:14,140 --> 03:12:21,580
Half an hour later, Catherine heard someone
come up the stairs and then her door opened

2423
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:23,080
very gently.

2424
03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:27,580
Eleanor came into her room, looking pale and
quite nervous.

2425
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:32,881
Catherine worried that Captain Tilney was
in some kind of trouble and made Eleanor sit

2426
03:12:32,881 --> 03:12:35,160
down.

2427
03:12:35,160 --> 03:12:43,890
After a minute or two of silence, Miss Tilney
said, 'My dear Catherine, I have come to you

2428
03:12:43,890 --> 03:12:47,130
with bad news.

2429
03:12:47,130 --> 03:12:49,880
And I do not know how to tell you about it.

2430
03:12:49,880 --> 03:12:52,700
Oh, how shall I tell you?'

2431
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:55,170
'Has something happened to Henry?

2432
03:12:55,170 --> 03:13:00,970
Is there a messenger from Woodston downstairs?'

2433
03:13:00,970 --> 03:13:04,690
'No, it is not anyone from Woodston.

2434
03:13:04,690 --> 03:13:07,110
My father himself has arrived.'

2435
03:13:07,110 --> 03:13:13,810
Eleanor's voice shook and she looked at the
carpet when she said, 'my father'.

2436
03:13:13,810 --> 03:13:19,010
Catherine was disappointed to know that General
Tilney had returned early, but she waited

2437
03:13:19,010 --> 03:13:21,220
for Eleanor to explain more.

2438
03:13:21,220 --> 03:13:32,950
'You are so good and kind, a friend who will
understand how difficult this is for me, especially

2439
03:13:32,950 --> 03:13:37,800
after we had happily agreed that you would
stay for another four weeks.

2440
03:13:37,800 --> 03:13:42,890
I am an unwilling messenger who has to tell
you that we must part.

2441
03:13:42,890 --> 03:13:49,109
My father has remembered that we accepted
an invitation to go to Lord Longtown's house,

2442
03:13:49,109 --> 03:13:51,710
near Hereford, for a fortnight.

2443
03:13:51,710 --> 03:13:54,069
We leave on Monday.

2444
03:13:54,069 --> 03:13:58,600
Explanation and apology are equally impossible.

2445
03:13:58,600 --> 03:14:01,160
My heart is too heavy to attempt either.'

2446
03:14:01,160 --> 03:14:05,229
'My dear Eleanor, don't be distressed.

2447
03:14:05,229 --> 03:14:12,470
I am very, very sorry that we must part so
soon, but I am not offended.

2448
03:14:12,470 --> 03:14:19,101
An earlier engagement must take priority,
and I can finish my visit later, or you can

2449
03:14:19,101 --> 03:14:21,739
come to me at Fullerton after Hereford.'

2450
03:14:21,739 --> 03:14:27,700
'It will not be in my power to do that,' Eleanor
said quietly.

2451
03:14:27,700 --> 03:14:31,340
'Come to Fullerton when you can, then.'

2452
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:39,130
Eleanor did not respond to this suggestion,
and Catherine continued, 'Monday is very soon.

2453
03:14:39,130 --> 03:14:41,529
And are you all going?

2454
03:14:41,529 --> 03:14:46,300
Don't worry, Eleanor, I can be ready to go
on Monday morning.

2455
03:14:46,300 --> 03:14:48,840
We can be together until it is time for you
to depart.

2456
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:54,410
It will not bother my parents if I show up
unannounced on Monday evening.

2457
03:14:54,410 --> 03:14:59,370
The General will send a servant with me, I
imagine, for half the trip, and then I will

2458
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:04,060
be at Salisbury and only nine miles from home.'

2459
03:15:04,060 --> 03:15:09,700
'Catherine, I wish I could tell you that those
were the arrangements.

2460
03:15:09,700 --> 03:15:12,601
But - what can I say?

2461
03:15:12,601 --> 03:15:19,410
You must leave us tomorrow morning; the carriage
has been ordered to be waiting for you at

2462
03:15:19,410 --> 03:15:28,319
seven o'clock and no servant will accompany
you.'

2463
03:15:28,319 --> 03:15:33,560
Catherine sank into a chair, unable to breathe
or to speak.

2464
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:42,570
'Dear Catherine,' Eleanor continued, 'I could
hardly believe my senses when I was told.

2465
03:15:42,570 --> 03:15:46,700
No disappointment or anger on your part could
be greater than my own.

2466
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:52,390
What will your father and mother say after
we took you away from the Allens, your true

2467
03:15:52,390 --> 03:15:56,609
friends, and brought you here, so far from
your home?

2468
03:15:56,609 --> 03:16:02,080
And now you are cruelly driven out of the
house without the smallest consideration for

2469
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:03,680
your comfort or safety.

2470
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:10,910
Dear, dear Catherine, I had to deliver the
message, but you know that I have no real

2471
03:16:10,910 --> 03:16:12,600
power in this house.

2472
03:16:12,600 --> 03:16:17,050
I think you know who is responsible for this
insult.'

2473
03:16:17,050 --> 03:16:21,960
'Have I offended the General?'

2474
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:23,439
Catherine asked weakly.

2475
03:16:23,439 --> 03:16:30,970
'I can think of nothing that you have done
to offend him, but I have never seen him so

2476
03:16:30,970 --> 03:16:31,970
angry.'

2477
03:16:31,970 --> 03:16:36,750
Catherine struggled to speak for Eleanor's
sake.

2478
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:45,400
'I am very sorry if I have upset him; it is
the last thing I would do on purpose.

2479
03:16:45,400 --> 03:16:48,050
But don't be unhappy, Eleanor.

2480
03:16:48,050 --> 03:16:52,390
You must go to Hereford and keep your engagement.

2481
03:16:52,390 --> 03:16:58,399
I am only sorry that the trip was not remembered
sooner so I could have written home.

2482
03:16:58,399 --> 03:17:00,890
But it will not matter to my family.

2483
03:17:00,890 --> 03:17:03,069
They will be happy to see me.'

2484
03:17:03,069 --> 03:17:06,400
'But you should not have to make the journey
alone!'

2485
03:17:06,400 --> 03:17:08,360
'The journey is nothing.

2486
03:17:08,360 --> 03:17:11,300
It is less than seventy miles.

2487
03:17:11,300 --> 03:17:13,250
Don't think about that.

2488
03:17:13,250 --> 03:17:16,189
I can be ready at seven.

2489
03:17:16,189 --> 03:17:19,819
Please ask your servant to call me in time.'

2490
03:17:19,819 --> 03:17:27,810
After Eleanor left, Catherine burst into tears.

2491
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:30,170
She was being thrown out!

2492
03:17:30,170 --> 03:17:35,569
With no reasonable explanation nor apology
from General Tilney, she was being rudely

2493
03:17:35,569 --> 03:17:36,620
sent home.

2494
03:17:36,620 --> 03:17:43,239
She could not even say goodbye to Henry, and
what about her hopes?

2495
03:17:43,239 --> 03:17:47,069
Would she ever see him again?

2496
03:17:47,069 --> 03:17:54,949
How could a man who had been so polite and
kind to her, who had treated her fondly throughout

2497
03:17:54,949 --> 03:18:02,189
her time at Northanger Abbey, now act so rudely
towards her?

2498
03:18:02,189 --> 03:18:08,760
She must have offended him in some way and
given him reasons for treating her so badly.

2499
03:18:08,760 --> 03:18:10,810
Seven o'clock!

2500
03:18:10,810 --> 03:18:19,640
He wanted her out of the house before he left
his bedroom in the morning.

2501
03:18:19,640 --> 03:18:28,280
Catherine spent another sleepless night at
Northanger Abbey, but this time she was not

2502
03:18:28,280 --> 03:18:32,510
frightened by imagined ghosts and mysterious
chests and cupboards.

2503
03:18:32,510 --> 03:18:41,010
This time her anxiety had a basis in fact,
and neither the wind nor the darkness bothered

2504
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:42,010
her.

2505
03:18:42,010 --> 03:18:47,320
Instead, she lay awake wondering how things
had gone so badly wrong.

2506
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:52,430
By the time Eleanor came to her room at six
in the morning Catherine had finished her

2507
03:18:52,430 --> 03:18:55,840
packing, and she was almost dressed and ready
to depart.

2508
03:18:55,840 --> 03:19:01,390
Both young women remained silent, neither
knowing how to improve the situation.

2509
03:19:01,390 --> 03:19:06,710
At the breakfast table, Catherine could not
eat, but she thought about breakfast the day

2510
03:19:06,710 --> 03:19:07,710
before.

2511
03:19:07,710 --> 03:19:10,140
Happy, happy breakfast!

2512
03:19:10,140 --> 03:19:17,080
Henry had been there and the three of them
had chatted, enjoying everything present,

2513
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:23,229
and fearing nothing in the future except Henry's
visit to Woodston for a few days.

2514
03:19:23,229 --> 03:19:28,689
Henry had sat beside her and helped her to
food, and so Catherine now lost herself in

2515
03:19:28,689 --> 03:19:30,060
this memory.

2516
03:19:30,060 --> 03:19:34,930
Then she heard the carriage arrive outside
and remembered what was happening.

2517
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:41,400
Eleanor now felt the need to speak and hurried
to say, 'You must write to me, Catherine,

2518
03:19:41,400 --> 03:19:42,770
as soon as possible.

2519
03:19:42,770 --> 03:19:47,560
You must tell me you are safe at home and
have found your family well.

2520
03:19:47,560 --> 03:19:49,500
I will not expect more.

2521
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:54,750
Please send a letter to me at Lord Longtown's,
but address it to his daughter, my friend

2522
03:19:54,750 --> 03:19:55,790
Alice.'

2523
03:19:55,790 --> 03:20:03,979
'No, Eleanor,' Catherine answered quietly,
'if you are not allowed to receive a letter

2524
03:20:03,979 --> 03:20:07,921
from me, I think I had better not write.

2525
03:20:07,921 --> 03:20:10,430
I will have no trouble getting home safely.'

2526
03:20:10,430 --> 03:20:16,779
'I am not surprised by your feelings, dear
Catherine, and will not urge you to do something

2527
03:20:16,779 --> 03:20:22,420
you are unhappy about,' Eleanor answered sadly,
with tears in her eyes.

2528
03:20:22,420 --> 03:20:26,730
'Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you.

2529
03:20:26,730 --> 03:20:28,100
Please don't worry.'

2530
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:32,010
'Thank you, Catherine, and there is one more
thing.

2531
03:20:32,010 --> 03:20:37,149
You have been so long away from home that
I wonder if you have any money left for the

2532
03:20:37,149 --> 03:20:38,149
journey.'

2533
03:20:38,149 --> 03:20:43,490
Catherine quickly looked into her purse and
said, 'I had not thought about money, but

2534
03:20:43,490 --> 03:20:44,490
you are right.

2535
03:20:44,490 --> 03:20:48,120
I cannot pay for the journey to Fullerton.'

2536
03:20:48,120 --> 03:20:52,630
Eleanor gave Catherine money from her own
purse.

2537
03:20:52,630 --> 03:20:57,810
Soon the carriage was announced to be ready;
and Catherine and Eleanor's silent, sad looks

2538
03:20:57,810 --> 03:21:00,840
expressed more than any words could.

2539
03:21:00,840 --> 03:21:05,580
They hurried to the door, and Catherine was
soon climbing into the carriage.

2540
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:11,710
But she could not leave until she had asked
Eleanor with trembling lips to give her kind

2541
03:21:11,710 --> 03:21:14,729
regards to her absent friend.

2542
03:21:14,729 --> 03:21:24,160
But by almost mentioning his name, Catherine's
tears began again and she found her seat and

2543
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:27,720
covered her face with her handkerchief.

2544
03:21:27,720 --> 03:21:31,160
CHAPTER ELEVEN

2545
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:37,069
Reliable Family Life

2546
03:21:37,069 --> 03:21:41,960
Catherine felt too unhappy to be frightened
by the journey to Fullerton, and began it

2547
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:45,340
without worrying about its length or about
being alone.

2548
03:21:45,340 --> 03:21:52,399
Leaning back in the corner of the carriage,
crying and feeling cruelly treated, she had

2549
03:21:52,399 --> 03:21:57,029
gone a number of miles beyond the walls of
Northanger Abbey before she raised her head

2550
03:21:57,029 --> 03:21:59,560
and looked out of the window.

2551
03:21:59,560 --> 03:22:04,670
She recognised the road as the same one that
had taken her to Woodston only ten days earlier,

2552
03:22:04,670 --> 03:22:08,601
and she suffered even more as she thought
about the difference between that trip and

2553
03:22:08,601 --> 03:22:09,660
this one.

2554
03:22:09,660 --> 03:22:15,010
Every mile, as it brought her nearer Woodston,
added to her grief.

2555
03:22:15,010 --> 03:22:19,979
When the carriage passed the road that led
directly to Woodston, Catherine thought of

2556
03:22:19,979 --> 03:22:23,650
Henry and the day that she had spent at his
house there.

2557
03:22:23,650 --> 03:22:26,790
It had been one of the happiest days of her
life.

2558
03:22:26,790 --> 03:22:31,899
On that occasion the General had given her
the impression that he actually wished for

2559
03:22:31,899 --> 03:22:33,430
Henry to marry her.

2560
03:22:33,430 --> 03:22:41,649
Yes, only ten days ago she had felt so happy
about the future, and now, what had she done

2561
03:22:41,649 --> 03:22:46,670
or not done to deserve such a change in the
General's opinion of her?

2562
03:22:46,670 --> 03:22:52,480
The only offence against General Tilney that
Catherine could accuse herself of was her

2563
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:56,050
shocking suspicions about what had happened
to his wife.

2564
03:22:56,050 --> 03:23:00,880
But Catherine trusted that her secret was
safe with Henry; he would not have betrayed

2565
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:01,880
her.

2566
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:06,090
It was impossible for the General to know
that she once wondered if he might have murdered

2567
03:23:06,090 --> 03:23:10,239
his wife or made her a prisoner in her own
home.

2568
03:23:10,239 --> 03:23:16,110
Of course if he did know about her suspicions,
he would have a good reason to ask her to

2569
03:23:16,110 --> 03:23:22,699
leave, but she believed in Henry and was certain
that her secret was safe with him.

2570
03:23:22,699 --> 03:23:27,340
But more than anything, Catherine was anxious
about Henry's feelings when he returned to

2571
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:30,290
the Abbey and found that she had been sent
away.

2572
03:23:30,290 --> 03:23:33,880
Would he accept his father's reasons for throwing
her out?

2573
03:23:33,880 --> 03:23:39,120
Or would he regret that she was gone and hate
his father for sending her home?

2574
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:46,351
Would he argue with his father or remain obedient
and talk only to Eleanor about his true feelings?

2575
03:23:46,351 --> 03:23:52,561
While thinking over many questions and struggling
with doubts about herself, Catherine hardly

2576
03:23:52,561 --> 03:23:55,500
noticed the hours and miles flying by.

2577
03:23:55,500 --> 03:24:02,120
How would she explain to her family the circumstances
surrounding her sudden return to Fullerton?

2578
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:08,490
Would there be any pleasure in returning home
with such a story to tell?

2579
03:24:08,490 --> 03:24:14,040
How could she make it clear to them that Henry
and Eleanor were the finest, most interesting

2580
03:24:14,040 --> 03:24:17,190
and most reliable friends she had ever known?

2581
03:24:17,190 --> 03:24:22,210
How could she separate them from General Tilney
in her family's opinion?

2582
03:24:22,210 --> 03:24:26,980
It would break her heart if her family judged
her friends unfairly.

2583
03:24:26,980 --> 03:24:33,260
Finally, after a journey which had taken more
than eleven hours without accident or alarm,

2584
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:37,830
Catherine reached Fullerton just after six
thirty in the evening.

2585
03:24:37,830 --> 03:24:43,040
We would expect a heroine to return to her
native village after achieving great things,

2586
03:24:43,040 --> 03:24:46,350
with many stories of success to be proud of.

2587
03:24:46,350 --> 03:24:52,880
But this homecoming was very different from
what you or she might have hoped for.

2588
03:24:52,880 --> 03:24:59,860
Our heroine was returning home disappointed,
alone and without hope or joy.

2589
03:24:59,860 --> 03:25:05,340
Therefore, her carriage passed quickly through
the village and Catherine hurried into her

2590
03:25:05,340 --> 03:25:08,979
house, unwilling to meet the questioning eyes
of friends and neighbours.

2591
03:25:08,979 --> 03:25:16,300
But you must remember that the Morland family
would not have high expectations of any great

2592
03:25:16,300 --> 03:25:18,780
achievements or successes for Catherine.

2593
03:25:18,780 --> 03:25:24,070
Instead, although they would be surprised
by her unexpected arrival, they would simply

2594
03:25:24,070 --> 03:25:27,030
be very happy to have her at home again.

2595
03:25:27,030 --> 03:25:33,279
The two youngest children, a boy and girl
of six and four years old, looked out when

2596
03:25:33,279 --> 03:25:38,359
they heard the carriage stop at their gate,
expecting, as usual, to see a brother or sister

2597
03:25:38,359 --> 03:25:39,890
arrive home.

2598
03:25:39,890 --> 03:25:46,120
But when they saw that it was Catherine returning
after an absence of eleven weeks, they jumped

2599
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:52,529
for joy, shouted for their parents and ran
out to greet their older sister.

2600
03:25:52,529 --> 03:25:56,660
The warm, affectionate welcome that Catherine
received from her parents and brothers and

2601
03:25:56,660 --> 03:26:02,989
sisters awakened the best feelings in her
heart, and she found her troubled spirit calmed;

2602
03:26:02,989 --> 03:26:06,960
she even, at first, felt happy!

2603
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:12,470
But Mrs Morland noticed that the poor traveller
looked pale and tired, and soon had the family

2604
03:26:12,470 --> 03:26:13,689
seated round the tea-table.

2605
03:26:13,689 --> 03:26:19,819
With cups of tea and sandwiches in front of
them, everyone was eager to hear about Catherine's

2606
03:26:19,819 --> 03:26:25,630
adventures and to find out why she had come
home without warning.

2607
03:26:25,630 --> 03:26:31,979
Quite slowly, and with much hesitation, Catherine
tried to explain what had happened the night

2608
03:26:31,979 --> 03:26:38,840
before, and although her parents were usually
unwilling to criticise other people, they

2609
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:42,590
felt unable to pardon this insult to their
daughter.

2610
03:26:42,590 --> 03:26:48,930
They believed that General Tilney had acted
neither honourably nor kindly as a gentleman

2611
03:26:48,930 --> 03:26:51,620
or as a parent.

2612
03:26:51,620 --> 03:26:54,739
What could have made him treat a guest so
badly?

2613
03:26:54,739 --> 03:27:01,410
Like Catherine, they could see no reason for
his rude behaviour, especially after he had

2614
03:27:01,410 --> 03:27:05,500
treated her so well for the past four weeks.

2615
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:15,649
Finally, Mrs Morland ended the conversation
by saying, 'It is a strange business and General

2616
03:27:15,649 --> 03:27:22,300
Tilney must be a strange man, but you are
home now, safe and secure.

2617
03:27:22,300 --> 03:27:28,439
It is not worth troubling yourself any further
about that man's reasons.'

2618
03:27:28,439 --> 03:27:36,750
'But why couldn't he send Catherine home in
the proper manner if he had to leave for Hereford?'

2619
03:27:36,750 --> 03:27:39,920
asked Sarah, the eldest of Catherine's sisters.

2620
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:44,860
'I do not think we will discover his reasons,'
answered Mrs Morland.

2621
03:27:44,860 --> 03:27:50,620
'I feel sorry for his own children, who must
have a difficult time with him as their father.

2622
03:27:50,620 --> 03:27:57,520
But you managed well on your long trip, Catherine,
and I am very proud of you.

2623
03:27:57,520 --> 03:28:01,979
I believe you have grown up quite a lot in
the last eleven weeks.

2624
03:28:01,979 --> 03:28:09,010
I am glad I did not know of your journey while
it was happening, but now it has ended perhaps

2625
03:28:09,010 --> 03:28:12,199
there is no great harm done.

2626
03:28:12,199 --> 03:28:16,090
You are not the same little girl that we said
goodbye to eleven weeks ago.

2627
03:28:16,090 --> 03:28:23,640
You have grown up and can take care of yourself
now.'

2628
03:28:23,640 --> 03:28:27,649
Catherine hoped that her mother was right
about that, but her spirits were quite worn

2629
03:28:27,649 --> 03:28:31,750
down and she longed to be silent and alone.

2630
03:28:31,750 --> 03:28:36,150
She was happy to agree to her mother's suggestion
that she should go to bed early and gain the

2631
03:28:36,150 --> 03:28:38,380
benefit of a good night's rest.

2632
03:28:38,380 --> 03:28:44,811
Her parents knew she was tired and disappointed,
but they had not guessed that she was also

2633
03:28:44,811 --> 03:28:46,609
suffering from a broken heart.

2634
03:28:46,609 --> 03:28:51,890
Perhaps it is odd that with a young daughter
of seventeen just returning from her first

2635
03:28:51,890 --> 03:28:58,939
adventure away from home, they had not thought
of that.

2636
03:28:58,939 --> 03:29:05,609
As soon as breakfast had ended the next morning,
Catherine sat down to write the promised letter

2637
03:29:05,609 --> 03:29:08,479
to her friend at Northanger Abbey.

2638
03:29:08,479 --> 03:29:12,640
She regretted the cold manner in which she
had left Eleanor Tilney, and the fact that

2639
03:29:12,640 --> 03:29:15,700
she had never valued her kindness and character
enough.

2640
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:20,460
But most of all, she worried about leaving
Eleanor to deal with General Tilney and his

2641
03:29:20,460 --> 03:29:22,740
difficult nature.

2642
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:27,930
She wanted her letter to say how grateful
she was without reminding Eleanor of how the

2643
03:29:27,930 --> 03:29:29,199
visit had ended.

2644
03:29:29,199 --> 03:29:35,760
She wanted to be careful without being cold,
honest without placing blame.

2645
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:42,080
She did not want to cause Eleanor any pain,
and she did not want to embarrass herself

2646
03:29:42,080 --> 03:29:44,260
in case Henry saw the letter.

2647
03:29:44,260 --> 03:29:50,939
In the end, Catherine wrote a very short note
in which she expressed her grateful thanks

2648
03:29:50,939 --> 03:29:55,610
and her affectionate good wishes for Eleanor
and her brother, and in which she returned

2649
03:29:55,610 --> 03:29:58,399
the money Eleanor had given her for her journey.

2650
03:29:58,399 --> 03:30:06,410
'This is a very strange friendship,' said
Mrs Morland when Catherine had finished her

2651
03:30:06,410 --> 03:30:07,410
letter.

2652
03:30:07,410 --> 03:30:11,010
'Soon made and soon ended.

2653
03:30:11,010 --> 03:30:18,150
I am sorry that you were disappointed, because
Mrs Allen had only good things to say about

2654
03:30:18,150 --> 03:30:19,210
the Tilney children.

2655
03:30:19,210 --> 03:30:23,680
And you were so unlucky with your friend Isabella
too.

2656
03:30:23,680 --> 03:30:27,430
And poor James!

2657
03:30:27,430 --> 03:30:36,811
Well, we must live and learn; I hope your
next new friends will be more worth keeping.'

2658
03:30:36,811 --> 03:30:43,670
Catherine's cheeks went red as she warmly
answered, 'No friend can be more worth keeping

2659
03:30:43,670 --> 03:30:45,220
than Eleanor.'

2660
03:30:45,220 --> 03:30:50,851
'If that is true, Catherine, I hope that you
and she will meet again some time in the next

2661
03:30:50,851 --> 03:30:51,851
few years.

2662
03:30:51,851 --> 03:30:58,939
It is very likely to happen - imagine what
a pleasure it will be to see her again.'

2663
03:30:58,939 --> 03:31:04,310
But Catherine was not thinking only of Eleanor
as she listened to her mother's kind, but

2664
03:31:04,310 --> 03:31:05,310
painful words.

2665
03:31:05,310 --> 03:31:10,399
What would happen to Henry Tilney if she did
not meet him for a few years?

2666
03:31:10,399 --> 03:31:14,190
Her eyes filled with tears as she imagined
such a meeting.

2667
03:31:14,190 --> 03:31:19,140
He might have forgotten her and have met another
young woman who attracted him.

2668
03:31:19,140 --> 03:31:25,951
The next time she saw him, he might be a married
man with a family of his own - he might not

2669
03:31:25,951 --> 03:31:29,310
even recognise her!

2670
03:31:29,310 --> 03:31:34,330
Mrs Morland was disturbed by her daughter's
tears and proposed a visit to Mrs Allen.

2671
03:31:34,330 --> 03:31:38,670
And so mother and daughter began the walk
to their neighbour's house, which was less

2672
03:31:38,670 --> 03:31:40,930
than a quarter of a mile distant.

2673
03:31:40,930 --> 03:31:46,960
As they walked, Mrs Morland gave Catherine
her opinion of James's broken engagement.

2674
03:31:46,960 --> 03:31:55,771
'Of course we are sorry for James, but it
is good that the engagement has ended, and

2675
03:31:55,771 --> 03:31:57,740
there is no harm done in the end.

2676
03:31:57,740 --> 03:32:02,810
We did not know Miss Thorpe, and she had no
personal fortune.

2677
03:32:02,810 --> 03:32:08,279
And now, after such improper behaviour, we
have a very poor opinion of her.

2678
03:32:08,279 --> 03:32:14,149
James will recover, and I am sure that he
will use better judgement next time.'

2679
03:32:14,149 --> 03:32:21,109
Her mother's thoughts made Catherine reflect
on the changes in her own circumstances.

2680
03:32:21,109 --> 03:32:27,311
Three months ago she had been full of happy
expectations and had run between her home

2681
03:32:27,311 --> 03:32:33,960
and the Allens' house ten times a day with
a light heart and an independent spirit, looking

2682
03:32:33,960 --> 03:32:37,410
forward to new pleasures and without a care
in the world.

2683
03:32:37,410 --> 03:32:45,160
She could picture herself three months ago,
and now what a different young woman she was!

2684
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:51,960
The Allens were surprised, but very glad,
to see Catherine, and they too were very angry

2685
03:32:51,960 --> 03:32:56,610
and displeased on learning how she had been
treated by General Tilney.

2686
03:32:56,610 --> 03:33:01,960
'Catherine surprised us yesterday evening,'
reported Mrs Morland.

2687
03:33:01,960 --> 03:33:07,300
'She travelled all the way in a carriage by
herself and knew nothing about her journey

2688
03:33:07,300 --> 03:33:09,290
until late Saturday night.

2689
03:33:09,290 --> 03:33:13,770
General Tilney returned home with the strange
idea that he was tired of having her in his

2690
03:33:13,770 --> 03:33:14,810
house.

2691
03:33:14,810 --> 03:33:21,569
He must be a very odd man, very unfriendly
certainly, but we are so glad to have Catherine

2692
03:33:21,569 --> 03:33:22,569
with us again.

2693
03:33:22,569 --> 03:33:28,430
And it is a great comfort to find that she
is not a poor helpless creature, but can manage

2694
03:33:28,430 --> 03:33:32,130
very well for herself.'

2695
03:33:32,130 --> 03:33:34,660
Mrs Allen was shocked.

2696
03:33:34,660 --> 03:33:40,000
She filled every pause in the conversation
by saying, 'I really have no patience with

2697
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:41,260
the General.'

2698
03:33:41,260 --> 03:33:44,340
But she did not allow for many pauses.

2699
03:33:44,340 --> 03:33:49,029
'Bath is a nice place, Catherine, after all,'
she said brightly.

2700
03:33:49,029 --> 03:33:51,410
'I did not like the idea of leaving.

2701
03:33:51,410 --> 03:33:53,739
Did I tell you that I tore my blue dress?

2702
03:33:53,739 --> 03:33:57,910
I had it mended before we left Bath and you
cannot see the tear.

2703
03:33:57,910 --> 03:34:01,760
And Mrs Thorpe was such a comfort to us, wasn't
she?

2704
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:04,410
You know, you and I were quite lonely at first.'

2705
03:34:04,410 --> 03:34:11,220
'Yes, but that did not last long,' Catherine
replied brightly, enjoying thoughts of Bath

2706
03:34:11,220 --> 03:34:12,630
and happier days.

2707
03:34:12,630 --> 03:34:13,830
'Very true.

2708
03:34:13,830 --> 03:34:16,739
Then we met Mrs Thorpe and were always busy.

2709
03:34:16,739 --> 03:34:21,000
My dear, do you think these silk gloves still
look well?

2710
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,340
I wore them for the first time in Bath.

2711
03:34:23,340 --> 03:34:25,080
Do you remember that evening?'

2712
03:34:25,080 --> 03:34:28,850
'Oh, yes, perfectly,' answered Catherine.

2713
03:34:28,850 --> 03:34:32,270
'It was very agreeable, wasn't it?

2714
03:34:32,270 --> 03:34:36,750
Mr Tilney drank tea with us that evening,
and I thought he was an excellent addition

2715
03:34:36,750 --> 03:34:38,000
to our little society.

2716
03:34:38,000 --> 03:34:40,520
He is a kind gentleman, isn't he?

2717
03:34:40,520 --> 03:34:43,090
I think you probably danced with him that
evening.

2718
03:34:43,090 --> 03:34:47,859
I am not certain, but I was wearing my most
expensive dress, do you remember?

2719
03:34:47,859 --> 03:34:51,110
And Mr Tilney admired it very much.'

2720
03:34:51,110 --> 03:34:57,859
Catherine felt too emotional to answer, but
Mrs Allen continued, 'I really have no patience

2721
03:34:57,859 --> 03:34:58,990
with the General.

2722
03:34:58,990 --> 03:35:03,199
He seemed such an admirable gentleman when
we met him.

2723
03:35:03,199 --> 03:35:07,430
Do you know, Catherine, that his lodgings
were rented by another family the day after

2724
03:35:07,430 --> 03:35:09,160
he and his children left?

2725
03:35:09,160 --> 03:35:13,200
But no wonder - it was such a desirable address.'

2726
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:22,590
As they walked home again, Mrs Morland said,
'You must be grateful for your old friends.

2727
03:35:22,590 --> 03:35:26,850
They have loved you and been concerned for
your happiness for many years.

2728
03:35:26,850 --> 03:35:35,220
Having the affection and good opinion of friends
like Mr and Mrs Allen is much more important

2729
03:35:35,220 --> 03:35:39,830
than your recent unhappy experience.'

2730
03:35:39,830 --> 03:35:44,551
Catherine knew that these were wise words,
but at that moment they meant little to her.

2731
03:35:44,551 --> 03:35:51,140
Her present happiness did not depend on old
friends, but on the behaviour of her newest

2732
03:35:51,140 --> 03:35:52,140
friends.

2733
03:35:52,140 --> 03:35:57,370
Mrs Morland continued encouraging her daughter
to forget about the people she had met at

2734
03:35:57,370 --> 03:36:01,609
Bath as they walked towards home.

2735
03:36:01,609 --> 03:36:06,239
Catherine listened politely to her mother,
but she was silently reflecting that now Henry

2736
03:36:06,239 --> 03:36:14,000
must have arrived at Northanger; now he must
have heard about her departure; and now, perhaps,

2737
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:18,970
the family were leaving the Abbey for Hereford.

2738
03:36:18,970 --> 03:36:27,320
The following day, Mrs Morland sat with Catherine
and Sarah, her two eldest daughters, as they

2739
03:36:27,320 --> 03:36:29,380
worked at their various jobs.

2740
03:36:29,380 --> 03:36:35,120
Catherine had never been hard-working, nor
had she liked sitting indoors for very long,

2741
03:36:35,120 --> 03:36:39,590
but Mrs Morland noticed that her bad habits
had become even worse.

2742
03:36:39,590 --> 03:36:44,010
The seventeen-year-old could not sit still,
nor concentrate on a piece of work for even

2743
03:36:44,010 --> 03:36:45,830
ten minutes at a time.

2744
03:36:45,830 --> 03:36:51,500
She regularly stood up and walked around the
room or wandered into the garden.

2745
03:36:51,500 --> 03:36:53,330
Sitting quietly seemed impossible.

2746
03:36:53,330 --> 03:36:58,930
But worst of all to her mother was Catherine's
lack of energy and spirit.

2747
03:36:58,930 --> 03:37:05,160
She knew her daughter had never been a good
worker, but silence and sadness were unusual

2748
03:37:05,160 --> 03:37:06,160
for her.

2749
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:10,560
What had happened to her old, cheerful personality?

2750
03:37:10,560 --> 03:37:17,739
For two days Mrs Morland allowed this behaviour
to pass without a hint of criticism, but when

2751
03:37:17,739 --> 03:37:23,260
a third night's rest still had not returned
Catherine to her old self, she decided to

2752
03:37:23,260 --> 03:37:26,220
have a serious talk with her daughter.

2753
03:37:26,220 --> 03:37:35,649
'My dear Catherine, I am afraid you have become
too grand for your own family.

2754
03:37:35,649 --> 03:37:38,529
Should your father mend his own shirts?

2755
03:37:38,529 --> 03:37:44,910
Look how steadily your sister is working,
while your head is still in Bath.

2756
03:37:44,910 --> 03:37:48,900
You must remember that there is a time for
everything.

2757
03:37:48,900 --> 03:37:56,439
Now is not the time for balls and theatre;
now is the time for you to be useful to me

2758
03:37:56,439 --> 03:38:00,310
and to your family.'

2759
03:38:00,310 --> 03:38:07,069
Catherine picked up her sewing basket and
sadly replied, 'I do not think about Bath.

2760
03:38:07,069 --> 03:38:10,850
At least, not very much.'

2761
03:38:10,850 --> 03:38:16,699
'Then you must still be upset about General
Tilney, and that is very silly of you.

2762
03:38:16,699 --> 03:38:20,029
You probably will never see him again.

2763
03:38:20,029 --> 03:38:25,680
You should not worry about things you cannot
change.'

2764
03:38:25,680 --> 03:38:30,970
After a short silence, she continued, 'I hope
you have not found your home disappointing

2765
03:38:30,970 --> 03:38:34,820
because it is not as elegant as Northanger
Abbey.

2766
03:38:34,820 --> 03:38:38,060
That would be turning your visit into something
evil.

2767
03:38:38,060 --> 03:38:44,149
Wherever you are, but especially in your own
home, you should learn to be content.

2768
03:38:44,149 --> 03:38:52,279
I was not happy to hear you at breakfast talking
so much about the French bread and the beautiful

2769
03:38:52,279 --> 03:38:54,609
plates at Northanger.'

2770
03:38:54,609 --> 03:39:00,670
'I am sure I do not care about any of that,'
said Catherine quietly.

2771
03:39:00,670 --> 03:39:07,620
'I have a book,' Mrs Morland said, 'with a
very clever essay about young ladies who have

2772
03:39:07,620 --> 03:39:12,310
been spoiled by making friends with people
who are much grander than their own families.

2773
03:39:12,310 --> 03:39:14,560
I will find it for you later.

2774
03:39:14,560 --> 03:39:19,070
I am sure it will do you good.'

2775
03:39:19,070 --> 03:39:24,109
Catherine tried to get on with her work, but
after a few minutes Mrs Morland saw her staring

2776
03:39:24,109 --> 03:39:26,489
out of the window again.

2777
03:39:26,489 --> 03:39:30,910
She came to the conclusion that her daughter
was suffering, and she hastily left the room

2778
03:39:30,910 --> 03:39:37,319
to find her book of clever essays.

2779
03:39:37,319 --> 03:39:38,319
CHAPTER TWELVE

2780
03:39:38,319 --> 03:39:40,900
Happily Ever After...

2781
03:39:40,900 --> 03:39:41,900
Eventually

2782
03:39:41,900 --> 03:39:49,779
It took at least fifteen minutes for Mrs Morland
to find her book of essays, and then she had

2783
03:39:49,779 --> 03:39:54,899
a few other tasks to complete before she could
return to her daughter.

2784
03:39:54,899 --> 03:40:01,189
And when she was able to return, she was surprised
to find a visitor there, someone whom she

2785
03:40:01,189 --> 03:40:02,989
had never seen before.

2786
03:40:02,989 --> 03:40:09,060
With a look of much respect, the young man
immediately rose, and Catherine introduced

2787
03:40:09,060 --> 03:40:11,489
Mr Henry Tilney to her mother.

2788
03:40:11,489 --> 03:40:15,890
Mr Tilney quickly began to apologise to Mrs
Morland.

2789
03:40:15,890 --> 03:40:19,290
'I am sorry to arrive here without an invitation.

2790
03:40:19,290 --> 03:40:25,210
I know that you cannot welcome a visitor from
Northanger Abbey after what happened to Miss

2791
03:40:25,210 --> 03:40:30,149
Morland there, but I was impatient to know
that she had arrived home safely.'

2792
03:40:30,149 --> 03:40:37,040
Mrs Morland had never blamed Henry or his
sister for their father's rude behaviour,

2793
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:42,100
and now she was very pleased by this young
man's appearance and by his sincere apology.

2794
03:40:42,100 --> 03:40:47,120
'Thank you, Mr Tilney, for your kind treatment
of Catherine.

2795
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:50,630
I believe you have nothing to apologise for.

2796
03:40:50,630 --> 03:40:57,310
You, and any friends of our children, are
always welcome to visit us at Fullerton.'

2797
03:40:57,310 --> 03:41:03,240
Then she continued with a list of polite questions
about Mr Tilney's journey, the weather and

2798
03:41:03,240 --> 03:41:05,960
the condition of the roads.

2799
03:41:05,960 --> 03:41:11,540
Meanwhile Catherine remained silent, but her
mother could see from her bright eyes and

2800
03:41:11,540 --> 03:41:19,020
rosy cheeks that she was very pleased by Mr
Tilney's presence, and Mrs Morland slipped

2801
03:41:19,020 --> 03:41:23,740
the book of essays into a convenient drawer
for a future hour.

2802
03:41:23,740 --> 03:41:30,520
Eventually Mrs Morland exhausted her supply
of polite questions, and Henry turned to Catherine

2803
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:38,410
for the first time since her mother's entrance
and asked, 'Are Mr and Mrs Allen now at Fullerton?'

2804
03:41:38,410 --> 03:41:43,780
Catherine struggled to calm her nerves and
answer sensibly, but finally made it clear

2805
03:41:43,780 --> 03:41:45,840
that the Allens were at home.

2806
03:41:45,840 --> 03:41:51,319
'I would like to pay my respects to them,'
Mr Tilney said.

2807
03:41:51,319 --> 03:41:55,010
His face was now almost as red as Catherine's.

2808
03:41:55,010 --> 03:42:00,830
'I wonder if you would be kind enough to show
me the way to their house, Miss Morland?'

2809
03:42:00,830 --> 03:42:07,290
'You can see it from that window,' interrupted
Sarah, who continued to sew quietly but was

2810
03:42:07,290 --> 03:42:09,529
keeping an eye on what was happening.

2811
03:42:09,529 --> 03:42:16,350
Mr Tilney bowed politely, but Mrs Morland
gave her younger daughter a silencing nod.

2812
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:22,460
They both understood that seeing the Allens
was not the primary purpose of Mr Tilney's

2813
03:42:22,460 --> 03:42:23,680
invitation.

2814
03:42:23,680 --> 03:42:28,020
Mrs Morland thought that he might want to
explain his father's behaviour to Catherine

2815
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:34,810
in private, and she did not intend to put
any barriers in the way of that conversation;

2816
03:42:34,810 --> 03:42:39,819
she encouraged Catherine to walk to the Allens'
house with Mr Tilney.

2817
03:42:39,819 --> 03:42:48,970
Mrs Morland was correct: Henry Tilney did
want to explain his father's rudeness - a

2818
03:42:48,970 --> 03:42:54,220
difficult task for a son - but that was not
his primary reason for wanting to talk to

2819
03:42:54,220 --> 03:42:55,300
Catherine.

2820
03:42:55,300 --> 03:43:02,949
Above all, he wanted to explain himself, and
before they reached the Allens' house he had

2821
03:43:02,949 --> 03:43:05,310
done that extremely well.

2822
03:43:05,310 --> 03:43:11,449
In fact it was a speech that Catherine thought
could not be repeated too often.

2823
03:43:11,449 --> 03:43:20,510
Henry assured her of his affection, and asked
if he could hope that she also loved him - something

2824
03:43:20,510 --> 03:43:25,300
that you will have no doubts about by this
time.

2825
03:43:25,300 --> 03:43:31,920
Henry was sincerely and completely attached
to our heroine; he was delighted by her character

2826
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:35,600
and truly loved spending all his time with
her.

2827
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:41,850
But you must understand that his love and
affection for Catherine had its origin in

2828
03:43:41,850 --> 03:43:48,239
something quite simple; he had recognised
that she seemed to admire everything about

2829
03:43:48,239 --> 03:43:53,510
him, and for this he was very grateful.

2830
03:43:53,510 --> 03:43:59,320
So on this basis, although Henry would not
have been able to explain his reasons to himself,

2831
03:43:59,320 --> 03:44:04,390
he proposed marriage to Miss Catherine Morland.

2832
03:44:04,390 --> 03:44:10,330
The visit to Mr and Mrs Allen's house was
very short.

2833
03:44:10,330 --> 03:44:14,930
Both Catherine and Henry were thinking of
something much more important than chatting

2834
03:44:14,930 --> 03:44:16,229
about Bath.

2835
03:44:16,229 --> 03:44:22,380
Henry was polite, Catherine scarcely said
a word, and soon the young couple were happily

2836
03:44:22,380 --> 03:44:28,290
walking along the path together again, with
nothing to do except think of their future

2837
03:44:28,290 --> 03:44:29,800
life together.

2838
03:44:29,800 --> 03:44:36,670
Can you imagine the joy that filled our heroine's
heart?

2839
03:44:36,670 --> 03:44:42,030
She floated along beside Mr Tilney in a cloud
of happiness, as he talked about this and

2840
03:44:42,030 --> 03:44:43,030
that.

2841
03:44:43,030 --> 03:44:48,600
But she listened carefully when her dear Henry
said that he did not have his father's permission

2842
03:44:48,600 --> 03:44:49,609
to approach her.

2843
03:44:49,609 --> 03:44:56,859
On his return from Woodston, two days earlier,
he had been met near the Abbey by his impatient

2844
03:44:56,859 --> 03:44:57,859
father.

2845
03:44:57,859 --> 03:45:03,290
In very angry terms the General had insisted
that Henry should never think of Miss Catherine

2846
03:45:03,290 --> 03:45:04,860
Morland again.

2847
03:45:04,860 --> 03:45:10,790
This information shocked Catherine, but more
important was the fact that Henry wanted to

2848
03:45:10,790 --> 03:45:11,870
marry her.

2849
03:45:11,870 --> 03:45:17,760
Knowing that she was loved gave her the courage
to try to understand the motives for General

2850
03:45:17,760 --> 03:45:21,899
Tilney's actions and for his disapproval of
her.

2851
03:45:21,899 --> 03:45:27,939
As Henry's story unfolded, her curiosity turned
to delight.

2852
03:45:27,939 --> 03:45:34,040
His father had found no reason to criticise
Catherine's behaviour or her character; he

2853
03:45:34,040 --> 03:45:40,189
was, instead, disappointed by his own actions
and ashamed of having been misled by Mr John

2854
03:45:40,189 --> 03:45:41,189
Thorpe.

2855
03:45:41,189 --> 03:45:47,060
Catherine, it seemed, was guilty of only one
thing in the General's opinion: she was less

2856
03:45:47,060 --> 03:45:49,670
rich than he had supposed her to be.

2857
03:45:49,670 --> 03:45:55,770
The General had been deceived by John Thorpe
at their first meeting, at the theatre in

2858
03:45:55,770 --> 03:45:56,949
Bath.

2859
03:45:56,949 --> 03:46:02,090
On that occasion, Henry had been talking to
Catherine and the General had asked Mr Thorpe

2860
03:46:02,090 --> 03:46:04,149
if he knew the young lady.

2861
03:46:04,149 --> 03:46:11,729
John Thorpe had a misleading, and even dangerous,
habit of exaggerating the importance and wealth

2862
03:46:11,729 --> 03:46:16,830
of his friends and acquaintances; he seemed
to think that this made him more important

2863
03:46:16,830 --> 03:46:18,250
in the eyes of the world.

2864
03:46:18,250 --> 03:46:24,760
When he had become friends with James Morland,
he had reported to his family that he had

2865
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:32,090
met a young man from a very grand family;
then, introducing James to Isabella, he had

2866
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:36,729
doubled the amount of his friend's living,
multiplied his private fortune by three or

2867
03:46:36,729 --> 03:46:42,569
four times, invented a rich aunt for him,
and forgot about half of James's brothers

2868
03:46:42,569 --> 03:46:43,569
and sisters.

2869
03:46:43,569 --> 03:46:49,500
John Thorpe had continued with this practice
of exaggeration when telling General Tilney

2870
03:46:49,500 --> 03:46:50,790
about the Morland family.

2871
03:46:50,790 --> 03:46:57,010
He had invented a large private income for
Catherine, whom he himself had decided to

2872
03:46:57,010 --> 03:47:02,860
marry, as well as the promise that she would
one day receive an enormous inheritance from

2873
03:47:02,860 --> 03:47:04,430
the Allens.

2874
03:47:04,430 --> 03:47:10,210
With this information, which he had no reason
to doubt, General Tilney had decided to welcome

2875
03:47:10,210 --> 03:47:15,470
Miss Morland to Northanger Abbey and to encourage
his son to consider Miss Catherine Morland

2876
03:47:15,470 --> 03:47:18,069
as a possible bride.

2877
03:47:18,069 --> 03:47:22,310
Henry and Eleanor knew nothing about their
father's conversation with John Thorpe; they

2878
03:47:22,310 --> 03:47:27,450
were astonished by the kind, friendly attention
he showed towards Catherine, and the clear

2879
03:47:27,450 --> 03:47:31,940
signals he gave Henry that he approved of
her as his son's future wife.

2880
03:47:31,940 --> 03:47:37,159
But on his visit to London, the General had
met Mr John Thorpe again.

2881
03:47:37,159 --> 03:47:42,170
The younger man was by that time suffering
from what he considered to be ill treatment

2882
03:47:42,170 --> 03:47:49,080
by both James and Catherine Morland: she had
refused his proposal of marriage and James

2883
03:47:49,080 --> 03:47:51,730
would not accept Isabella's apologies.

2884
03:47:51,730 --> 03:47:57,069
Now he was eager to change the General's good
opinion of the whole Morland family.

2885
03:47:57,069 --> 03:48:02,600
This time he gave a more accurate account
of how many Morland children there were and

2886
03:48:02,600 --> 03:48:09,279
the amount of money and possessions the parents
had; in fact, he mentioned too many of one

2887
03:48:09,279 --> 03:48:11,310
and too few of the other.

2888
03:48:11,310 --> 03:48:13,620
And the Allens?

2889
03:48:13,620 --> 03:48:20,600
Their entire fortune would be inherited by
one of Mr Allen's nephews.

2890
03:48:20,600 --> 03:48:26,800
Angry with almost everyone in the world except
himself, the General had returned to the Abbey,

2891
03:48:26,800 --> 03:48:31,100
where you have seen how he behaved towards
our heroine.

2892
03:48:31,100 --> 03:48:38,270
Having heard all this, Catherine forgave herself
for thinking that General Tilney could either

2893
03:48:38,270 --> 03:48:40,729
have murdered or imprisoned his wife.

2894
03:48:40,729 --> 03:48:46,300
Now she understood how cruel he could be in
reality.

2895
03:48:46,300 --> 03:48:51,949
Poor Henry was blushing with shame while telling
Catherine this story.

2896
03:48:51,949 --> 03:48:57,189
He had had an angry conversation with his
father at Northanger Abbey, and had shocked

2897
03:48:57,189 --> 03:49:01,290
the General by refusing to agree with his
judgement of Catherine.

2898
03:49:01,290 --> 03:49:07,620
He felt tied to Catherine as much by honour
as affection; he would not dismiss her from

2899
03:49:07,620 --> 03:49:09,880
his heart or from his life.

2900
03:49:09,880 --> 03:49:15,859
He refused to accompany Eleanor and his father
to Herefordshire, and declared his intention

2901
03:49:15,859 --> 03:49:17,671
of asking Miss Morland to marry him.

2902
03:49:17,671 --> 03:49:26,529
General Tilney had been angrier than he had
ever been with his son, and the two had parted

2903
03:49:26,529 --> 03:49:28,880
without speaking to each other again.

2904
03:49:28,880 --> 03:49:35,390
Henry had returned to Woodston, and had begun
his journey to Fullerton on the following

2905
03:49:35,390 --> 03:49:37,399
afternoon.

2906
03:49:37,399 --> 03:49:46,390
Mr and Mrs Morland were quite astonished to
be asked by Mr Henry Tilney for permission

2907
03:49:46,390 --> 03:49:48,130
to marry their daughter.

2908
03:49:48,130 --> 03:49:54,189
They had not suspected a connection between
the two young people, but they believed Catherine

2909
03:49:54,189 --> 03:49:58,680
was worth loving and they soon happily accepted
the situation.

2910
03:49:58,680 --> 03:50:04,790
They had no reason to object to the marriage,
not having heard anything negative about Henry

2911
03:50:04,790 --> 03:50:07,729
and liking his pleasing manners and good sense.

2912
03:50:07,729 --> 03:50:15,620
Mrs Morland's only additional comment was,
'I am sure Catherine will make a poor housekeeper,

2913
03:50:15,620 --> 03:50:18,960
but practice is a good teacher.'

2914
03:50:18,960 --> 03:50:25,859
Nevertheless, even with everyone celebrating
the proposal, Mr and Mrs Morland could not

2915
03:50:25,859 --> 03:50:27,760
approve of the engagement.

2916
03:50:27,760 --> 03:50:35,270
They had mild tempers, but their principles
were strong; they did not expect heartfelt

2917
03:50:35,270 --> 03:50:39,069
approval from the General, but they required
his agreement, at least.

2918
03:50:39,069 --> 03:50:46,250
They assured the pair that they would be happy
for them to marry when that agreement was

2919
03:50:46,250 --> 03:50:52,351
obtained, but not before, and they trusted
that it would not be denied for long.

2920
03:50:52,351 --> 03:50:58,960
There need be no expectation of money from
the father, since his son's present income

2921
03:50:58,960 --> 03:51:06,359
already made him independent and comfortable,
their daughter could not hope for more.

2922
03:51:06,359 --> 03:51:08,170
The young people were not surprised by this
decision.

2923
03:51:08,170 --> 03:51:13,420
They were, of course, upset, but they parted
from each other with the hope that the General's

2924
03:51:13,420 --> 03:51:16,170
opinion could be changed very soon.

2925
03:51:16,170 --> 03:51:22,409
Henry returned to what was now his only home,
at Woodston, to look after his parish and

2926
03:51:22,409 --> 03:51:28,159
to make improvements to his house for his
future wife; Catherine remained at Fullerton

2927
03:51:28,159 --> 03:51:32,899
to cry rather dramatically and to look forward
to regular letters from Henry.

2928
03:51:32,899 --> 03:51:38,130
We need not enquire whether the difficulties
of absence were made easier by such secret

2929
03:51:38,130 --> 03:51:39,130
communication.

2930
03:51:39,130 --> 03:51:45,500
Mr and Mrs Morland never did - they had been
too kind to demand promises and whenever Catherine

2931
03:51:45,500 --> 03:51:50,630
received a letter, which happened quite often,
they always looked the other way.

2932
03:51:50,630 --> 03:51:57,310
As we approach the last of these pages, you
will have guessed that a happy ending is promised

2933
03:51:57,310 --> 03:51:58,470
very soon.

2934
03:51:58,470 --> 03:52:02,930
The only doubt can be the way in which perfect
happiness was achieved.

2935
03:52:02,930 --> 03:52:07,939
What circumstance could possibly change the
General's opinion of a marriage between his

2936
03:52:07,939 --> 03:52:09,649
son and Miss Morland?

2937
03:52:09,649 --> 03:52:11,960
The answer was another marriage.

2938
03:52:11,960 --> 03:52:18,109
In the course of the summer, Eleanor Tilney
married a young man with a large fortune and

2939
03:52:18,109 --> 03:52:20,409
a very respectable position in society.

2940
03:52:20,409 --> 03:52:27,290
Such an addition to his own importance threw
the General into a good mood for months, and

2941
03:52:27,290 --> 03:52:31,810
Eleanor insisted that he must forgive Henry
and accept Catherine as his future daughter-in-law.

2942
03:52:31,810 --> 03:52:39,740
Everyone who knows Eleanor Tilney will, I
am sure, congratulate her and wish her well

2943
03:52:39,740 --> 03:52:45,310
in the home and with the man of her choice,
away from the strict discipline of Northanger

2944
03:52:45,310 --> 03:52:46,310
Abbey.

2945
03:52:46,310 --> 03:52:49,960
My own joy on the occasion is very sincere.

2946
03:52:49,960 --> 03:52:56,090
I know of no one who, after all her suffering,
deserves happiness more.

2947
03:52:56,090 --> 03:53:02,290
And her husband was a young man who truly
deserved her: he was not only rich and important,

2948
03:53:02,290 --> 03:53:04,640
but also affectionate and charming.

2949
03:53:04,640 --> 03:53:10,000
Eleanor had known him for years, but General
Tilney had approved of him as little as he

2950
03:53:10,000 --> 03:53:15,729
approved of Catherine, and for the same reason:
he came from a respectable family with no

2951
03:53:15,729 --> 03:53:16,729
money.

2952
03:53:16,729 --> 03:53:24,260
But then this young man inherited an enormous
fortune as well as a title, and the General's

2953
03:53:24,260 --> 03:53:26,110
opinion changed immediately.

2954
03:53:26,110 --> 03:53:31,441
Suddenly he too could see that Eleanor's future
husband was the most charming young man in

2955
03:53:31,441 --> 03:53:32,441
the world.

2956
03:53:32,441 --> 03:53:38,790
And I should add that this was the same gentleman
whose careless servant left the laundry lists

2957
03:53:38,790 --> 03:53:46,310
in a drawer at Northanger Abbey and involved
our heroine in one of her most alarming adventures.

2958
03:53:46,310 --> 03:53:53,189
Eleanor and her delightful, rich husband used
their influence to persuade the General that

2959
03:53:53,189 --> 03:53:56,810
Henry should be allowed to marry Catherine
Morland.

2960
03:53:56,810 --> 03:54:02,649
In fact, they explained that Catherine was
not, in fact, poor and would have an income

2961
03:54:02,649 --> 03:54:08,340
of her own of three thousand pounds a year,
and that her father was much wealthier than

2962
03:54:08,340 --> 03:54:12,630
John Thorpe had reported during his second
meeting with General Tilney.

2963
03:54:12,630 --> 03:54:19,199
As a result of this happy news, the General
soon permitted his son to return to Northanger

2964
03:54:19,199 --> 03:54:24,550
Abbey and wrote to Mr Morland, politely giving
his agreement to the marriage of his younger

2965
03:54:24,550 --> 03:54:27,560
son and the Morlands' eldest daughter.

2966
03:54:27,560 --> 03:54:34,739
The event which the General's letter permitted
soon followed: Henry and Catherine were married,

2967
03:54:34,739 --> 03:54:38,180
the church bells rang and everybody celebrated.

2968
03:54:38,180 --> 03:54:44,680
The wedding took place less than twelve months
after the young couple had met, so the General's

2969
03:54:44,680 --> 03:54:48,210
cruelty did not hurt them very much or for
very long.

2970
03:54:48,210 --> 03:54:54,010
To begin perfect happiness at twenty-six and
eighteen is to do quite well.

2971
03:54:54,010 --> 03:54:59,970
I should add, moreover, that perhaps the General
added to this happiness by delaying the marriage

2972
03:54:59,970 --> 03:55:07,390
and giving them time to improve their knowledge
of each other and to strengthen their attachment.

2973
03:55:07,390 --> 03:55:13,319
I leave it for you to make a final judgement
on this question: Is the purpose of this story

2974
03:55:13,319 --> 03:55:18,649
to recommend parental cruelty, or to reward
a son's disobedience?
