00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,819
CHAPTER ONE
Open Doors

2
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:11,460
Kathy Page had been blinded at birth.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,770
She had been born two months early, and at
that time doctors had not yet realized that

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,370
giving a new baby pure oxygen to breathe would
destroy the sensitive nerves at the back of

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,950
its eyes.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,440
But that was then.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,690
Kathy Page was now a leading journalist in
British radio.

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,900
She was best known for her intelligent, but
tough, interviews of public figures and people

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,160
in the news.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,969
A recent interview was typical of her style:

11
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,399
'So, your election promise to uncover political
dishonesty, does that include the bribing

12
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,350
of government ministers?'

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,790
'Of course.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,150
This government will not tolerate dishonesty
of any sort.'

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,590
'Would that include the money you received
from foreign businessmen and didn't tell your

16
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,970
government about?'

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,740
'Er... that was a misunderstanding...

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,630
I can explain everything.'

19
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,500
'Can you explain the government contracts
given to those same businessmen shortly afterwards?'

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,490
'Well... er...'

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,479
'Thank you, Minister.

22
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,360
And now over to the newsdesk.'

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,180
Kathy Page had no patience with any attempts
to hide the truth.

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,060
She had a voice that was gentle and calm,
almost motherly at times, which men found

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,000
attractive.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,090
Nearly everybody she interviewed tended to
relax more when she spoke.

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,170
That was when Kathy was at her most effective.

28
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,130
More than one politician had cause to be sorry
for a careless reply to the relaxing manner

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,340
of her voice.

30
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,660
Kathy knew better than most people how to
listen to the human voice.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,910
She couldn't see all the little tricks people
sometimes used with body language and the

32
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,950
expressions on their faces to give false ideas
of their real feelings.

33
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,420
She could only hear what they said.

34
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,870
It was almost impossible for the people she
interviewed to hide the tiny changes of expression

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,570
in their voices that showed what they really
thought.

36
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,870
No matter how hard they tried to cover it
up, she could always tell when a person was

37
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,840
feeling uncomfortable and could usually understand
the reason why.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
Kathy would be kind to guests who were not
used to being the center of attention.

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,340
For example, she understood the natural shyness
of an old lady who had been given a prize

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,450
for her work with the poor.

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:14,060
But if she thought a guest was lying she would
not stop questioning until she had discovered

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,780
the truth.

43
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,310
If a lie had been told she always made sure
her listeners knew it.

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,310
Politicians and businessmen often thought
that somehow they could fool her.

45
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,710
They rarely did.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,370
Kathy was too good at her job for that.

47
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,260
Her listeners loved her.

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,500
She was their star.

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,660
They knew that if anyone could find out the
truth, it was Kathy Page.

50
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,110
Kathy had been in the business of radio reporting
for thirty of her fifty years in the world.

51
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,450
She was happy in her work.

52
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,760
She had never married, though she was often
told that she was attractive.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,950
She was.

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,890
Her black hair was long and shiny without
a touch of grey; her face was pretty without

55
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:17,720
being weak, and the few lines which showed
made it more interesting.

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,750
Many hours of yoga had kept her figure in
good shape.

57
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,660
No, she was not short of male admirers.

58
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,500
Occasionally she would allow one to take her
to dinner if he could hold an interesting

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,970
conversation, but she mostly preferred the
company of her colleagues, her books and Trudy,

60
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,000
her much loved six-year-old guide dog.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,310
She loved music and the arts.

62
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,760
She regularly went to the theatre for old,
as well as new, productions.

63
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,990
It was a favourite activity of hers.

64
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,560
The only thing she ever regretted was that
she could not see paintings.

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,069
She had read a lot about great artists and
their work and often wished that she could

66
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:11,660
see a great painting, even if it were just
for a short while.

67
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:18,120
But then she would put away such thoughts;
they were silly and senseless.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,069
It would never happen.

69
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:27,620
Television producers had often, over the years,
tried to get Kathy to present her own chat

70
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,840
show on television.

71
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,469
They knew she was a favourite with the public,
and they wanted to attract the large audience

72
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,030
that such a show would surely bring.

73
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,199
Kathy always turned them down.

74
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,449
She felt at home with the radio.

75
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,979
It didn't matter what you looked like; it
was what you said that you would be judged

76
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,270
by.

77
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,219
That's what she always told everybody.

78
00:05:55,219 --> 00:06:04,449
And besides, Kathy Page, the queen of radio
interviews, was shy about her appearance.

79
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,240
'She turned you down?

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Again?

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,599
Are you sure you told her just how much money
we're offering?'

82
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:22,730
Mick Dean, the current favourite of his television
company, waved his other arm around as he

83
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,009
held the telephone.

84
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:31,130
There was nobody else in the office but he
waved anyway - it was just a way of showing

85
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,780
his feelings.

86
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,129
He couldn't understand how anybody could turn
down an offer like this.

87
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:44,080
He had had similar conversations before, all
about Kathy Page.

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,900
'OK, but don't give up.

89
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,099
Try again in a week.

90
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,539
Yes... bye.'

91
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,600
Mick Dean put the telephone down.

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,080
He was the company's youngest producer and
was responsible for many of its newest and

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,169
most successful shows.

94
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:11,199
He was particularly good at producing chat
shows and more 'serious' shows that interviewed

95
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,309
people in the news.

96
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:19,199
He believed that a lively argument was the
best way to entertain viewers; it would make

97
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,060
more people watch the next time.

98
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,990
'They like to see a good fight,' he would
always say.

99
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,629
'And they like fighters.'

100
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:37,520
That was why he had always wanted Kathy Page
to present one of his shows.

101
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,870
'Not only is she a good fighter, she looks
great, too, and people respect her.

102
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,750
She'd be a sure winner and I want her before
anybody else gets her!'

103
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,159
Yet again his best man had failed to persuade
Kathy to join him.

104
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,199
But Mick Dean was not the kind to give up.

105
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,400
He had not been the first producer to try
to win Kathy Page over to television, but

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,419
he was determined to be the last.

107
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,360
Kathy's radio show was one of the most popular
shows on the station.

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,839
She would interview people in the news and
deal with serious issues.

109
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:29,690
As well as the usual politicians and businessmen,
she often spoke to artists, writers and scientists.

110
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,800
The shows got more interesting for the listeners
when Kathy questioned her guests, especially

111
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,060
when the guests said things that Kathy found
hard to believe.

112
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,450
That really made things exciting.

113
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,290
It was getting towards the end of her morning
show and her final guest was coming on.

114
00:08:51,290 --> 00:09:00,400
He was an American scientist, Dr Woodrow Percival,
who was an expert in eye surgery.

115
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,290
He interested Kathy because he had said that
he could replace damaged eye nerves with tiny

116
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:16,380
computer chips that would work just as well
as real nerves, perhaps even better.

117
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,890
Kathy took a personal interest in this.

118
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,400
He had said, in fact, that he could make the
blind see.

119
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,290
What's more, he had said that he could make
her see.

120
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,740
Kathy had come across other 'experts' before.

121
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,040
Sometimes they were more interested in getting
publicity for themselves than in telling the

122
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,040
truth, saying that a small discovery was greater
than it really was.

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,830
If this guy had any real doubts about his
methods, Kathy thought, she would know it.

124
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:00,120
It was wrong to raise the hopes of people
who might otherwise have accepted their disability

125
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,080
and got on with their lives.

126
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,450
If he was offering false hope to people, he
should be found out - and she was just the

127
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,700
person to do it.

128
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,160
She introduced Dr Percival to her listeners
and began.

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,650
'Dr Percival, you're going to give a talk
later today about your new treatment.

130
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:32,160
Could you, in simple language, explain how
this treatment works?'

131
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,060
'Certainly.'

132
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,380
And that was exactly what he did.

133
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,400
Kathy was waiting for any little changes in
his voice that might suggest that he was not

134
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,130
sure about what he was saying.

135
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,570
His voice was calm.

136
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:54,100
It was not the voice of an old man - he was
forty - but it had a quality that suggested

137
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,660
strength of character.

138
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,640
She questioned him at frequent intervals,
listening carefully for any signs that might

139
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,780
show his answers to be false.

140
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,780
There were none.

141
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,830
Everything Dr Percival said was said in a
way that suggested he was being completely

142
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,830
truthful.

143
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,480
All of his answers were clear and open.

144
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,430
Kathy could find no fault with the man's voice
or his reasoning.

145
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:28,860
Finally, she asked the question she knew all
her listeners were waiting for.

146
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,950
'Dr Percival, you said that you could give
me the means to see.

147
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,390
That was a very personal thing to say.

148
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,720
Were you being serious?'

149
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,530
Kathy listened.

150
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,140
He had been good so far.

151
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,570
If he was going to show weakness, it would
surely be now.

152
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,280
'Miss Page, let me apologise...'

153
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,890
'This is it!'

154
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,640
thought Kathy.

155
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,550
'He's going to weaken!

156
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:09,060
He knows he can't seriously support the things
he says he can do!'

157
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,670
... for what the papers reported.

158
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,490
They named you in particular when, in fact,
I had only used you as an example.

159
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:25,500
What I actually said was that people whose
nerves had been damaged - in the way yours

160
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,880
had, for example - could be helped by my treatment.'

161
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,720
But Kathy, though she heard no sign of doubt
in his voice, wanted him to be very exact

162
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,650
with his answer.

163
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,970
She knew her listeners expected no less.

164
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,750
'Dr Percival, are you saying that you could
make me see?'

165
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:58,310
'Well, I'd have to see your medical records
in more detail, but I think so.

166
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,410
Yes.

167
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes, I could.'

168
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,280
It was time for the end of the programme.

169
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,500
Kathy thanked her guests and the closing music
was played.

170
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,060
She felt excited, yet guilty, for feeling
that way.

171
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,890
She had always thought that even if she had
been given the chance to see she would choose

172
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,780
not to, not after a lifetime without sight.

173
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,250
But at that time there .had been no hope.

174
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,480
There had been no point in hoping.

175
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,260
Hope was like a door shut and with no key
to open it.

176
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,820
Ever.

177
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,230
But now, this doctor sounded sure of himself.

178
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,460
She was certain of that.

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:53,110
For the first time since she was a girl she
allowed herself the hope of sight.

180
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,320
She found that she did want to see.

181
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,360
She wanted to see those pictures in the museums,
the faces of her friends, the sky at dawn

182
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,860
and the stars at night.

183
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,090
She realized she wanted it very much indeed.

184
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,720
Dr Woodrow Percival had to rush off to his
talk.

185
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,070
He thanked her and left.

186
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,860
Kathy heard the door of the studio close behind
him.

187
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,090
She knew that he might hold the key to doors
that had been closed to her since birth.

188
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,890
Could those doors really be opened for her?

189
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,140
She knew she had to find out.

190
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:43,920
The newspapers the next day were full of headlines
about the interview:

191
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,280
FAMOUS BLIND RADIO STAR PROMISED SIGHT BY
AMERICAN EXPERT.

192
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,170
WILL THIS MAN GIVE KATHY PAGE HER SIGHT?

193
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,250
GO FOR IT, KATHY!

194
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,860
The readers and listeners loved it.

195
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,690
Mick Dean loved it.

196
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:11,030
He immediately offered to pay all the costs
involved if Kathy would work for his television

197
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,010
company for just a few shows.

198
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,330
But Kathy hated all the publicity.

199
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,520
She was not afraid to speak up for her listeners,
but she hated the idea of strangers making

200
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,670
unwanted investigations into her private life.

201
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:35,970
And this, as far as she was concerned, was
a very private matter indeed.

202
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,930
She refused all interviews on the subject
and turned down Mick Dean's offer straight

203
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,490
away.

204
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,740
She thought it was nobody's business but her
own and that was final.

205
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,110
No further mention was made of the subject
on her show.

206
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,160
Guests were asked not to raise the matter.

207
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:05,100
They agreed, largely because they respected
Kathy and could understand her situation.

208
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,860
But Kathy had been busy.

209
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,070
She didn't want the world to know about her
personal life, so she had arranged to meet

210
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,280
Dr Woodrow Percival again in private.

211
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,480
She met him at the house of her agent, away
from her home and safe from the eyes of the

212
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,850
public.

213
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,190
Kathy was a wealthy woman.

214
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,010
She had made, over the years, a lot of money
from her work.

215
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:43,360
She could afford the cost of the operation
in Dr Percival's hospital in California, USA.

216
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,470
Dr Percival was as calm as ever and was glad
to help her.

217
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:55,290
He drank his tea as he sat in an armchair,
looking at Kathy as she fed Trudy a biscuit.

218
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:02,510
'I must repeat,' he said, 'that you'll be
the first person to receive this treatment.

219
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,459
It has worked in all the tests and all the
computer trials.

220
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,880
Having said that, I must also remind you of
the risk involved...'

221
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,659
'I understand, Dr Percival,' Kathy answered
quickly.

222
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:22,379
'I'm willing to take that risk.

223
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:26,039
This is something I've made up my mind about.

224
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,379
If it works for me it will work for others.

225
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,259
It'll be worth it.'

226
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:40,080
'Now don't misunderstand me, Miss Page; by
risk I don't mean to your life - that risk

227
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,309
is no more than it would be for any other
operation.

228
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,020
I mean the risk to your hopes.

229
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,419
I am confident the operation will work but
I'm not God.

230
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:01,340
Nobody can say for certain that you will have
the use of your eyes at the end of all this.

231
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:10,409
All I can say is there is no reason I can
see why the operation shouldn't be a success.

232
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:14,840
Are you still sure you want to go through
with it?'

233
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,210
Kathy took a deep breath then answered.

234
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,090
'Absolutely sure.

235
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,600
When can you start?'

236
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,140
The operation took place one month later at
the hospital in California.

237
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,840
Dr Percival thought the operation went well.

238
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,340
All that was needed now was a few weeks for
the tiny computer parts to join with Kathy's

239
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,950
sensitive damaged eye nerves.

240
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:51,470
During that time Kathy would need to rest
in bed with a bandage over her eyes.

241
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,720
Her brain would be checked regularly.

242
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,860
When it showed signs that the eye nerves were
working they would take the bandages off.

243
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,529
In those few weeks Kathy had plenty of time
to think about what she had done.

244
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:15,240
There were moments of doubt, almost panic,
when she asked herself if she had done the

245
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,230
right thing.

246
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,350
She thought she had long since put away the
foolish hopes for sight she had once held

247
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,169
as a girl.

248
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:28,909
Yet here she was, hoping like a girl again.

249
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:34,929
She felt afraid, yes, but also excited at
the thought of entering a world that would

250
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:40,220
be totally new to her, a world where she could
see.

251
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,009
It would be like being born a second time.

252
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,230
She wondered what colour would be like.

253
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,200
Although it was a word she had often used
and heard before, she had never experienced

254
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,460
colour.

255
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,510
She just could not imagine it, no matter how
hard she tried.

256
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:08,379
Kathy gave up trying and waited patiently
for the day her bandages would be removed.

257
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:11,940
The day came.

258
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,620
Dr Percival decided that Kathy's brain signals
were doing all that he had expected of them.

259
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,210
Things looked very promising.

260
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,019
It was time to see if the operation had been
a success.

261
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:32,340
He closed all the curtains in Kathy's room
so that the light was low.

262
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,210
He turned to her and spoke.

263
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,970
'Now, Kathy, we have to take things slowly.

264
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,220
Even if things go well you won't have full
eyesight to begin with.

265
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:51,200
First of all, let's see if your eyes are recognizing
light.

266
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,159
I'm going to take the bandage off and hold
a light in front of your eyes.

267
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,190
If you can see anything you won't need me
to tell you - you'll know.

268
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,379
But you won't see anything clearly yet, that
will come later.

269
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:11,159
Are you ready?'

270
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,749
Kathy nodded.

271
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:21,480
Dr Percival held a small light in front of
her eyes as a nurse slowly and carefully removed

272
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,350
her bandages.

273
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,259
Kathy sat up with her eyes still closed.

274
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:33,509
Slowly she opened them and stared at the light.

275
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:36,530
Quickly, she turned her face away.

276
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,530
'Ow!

277
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,250
What was that?

278
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:48,000
It felt strange - there's something there,
trying to get into my head!'

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,799
Dr Percival told the nurse to replace the
bandages and then turned to Kathy.

280
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:03,539
'Kathy,' he said with obvious delight, 'that
"something" is light!

281
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,059
You've seen light for the first time!

282
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,559
Congratulations - you can see!'

283
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,259
Kathy could tell from his voice that he was
pleased.

284
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,660
She felt confused.

285
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
'But...

286
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,110
I thought there would be more to it than this...

287
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,110
I mean...

288
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,419
I mean...

289
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,360
Oh, I don't know what I mean!'

290
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,830
'Don't worry, Kathy,' he said as he smiled.

291
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,409
'All you saw then was pure light.

292
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:45,660
It will take a while for your eyes to get
used to seeing colours and shapes.

293
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:51,529
Your brain has a lot of sorting out of new
information that it has never had to deal

294
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:52,720
with before.

295
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,809
It's bound to take a little while, even with
the advanced training methods I've developed.

296
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,690
The main thing is that you can see!'

297
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,820
'I can see!' said Kathy softly.

298
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,080
And underneath her bandages she was crying.

299
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,509
Over the next few weeks Kathy was progressively
allowed to use her eyes more often.

300
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:29,850
Soon she could tell dark from light, then
she could recognise colours and shapes.

301
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:36,639
But, for a while, she found it very difficult
to deal with the huge amounts of extra information

302
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:41,090
that her new sense was giving her every day.

303
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,350
One of her most difficult problems was judging
distance: she found it hard to tell the difference

304
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,490
between near and far objects.

305
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,440
She would reach out for things across the
room as if they were near to her, or she would

306
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,980
walk into close objects without realizing
how near they were.

307
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,340
But Dr Percival was patient.

308
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:14,230
Kathy was taken on walks around the hospital
gardens, taken for drives in the car and shown

309
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,909
videos and television programmes.

310
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,590
Her eyes were gently exercised until they
worked well.

311
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:30,290
'In fact, Kathy,' Dr Percival told her, your
eyes are better than mine are.

312
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,159
I need glasses and you don't!'

313
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,610
What Kathy enjoyed most was seeing the pleasing
effects shapes and colours produced.

314
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,830
She would see ordinary things as objects of
great beauty - the black and white squares

315
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:54,279
on a chess board, the shape of a hand, the
colours of a flower.

316
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:59,450
Sounds, for the first time in her life, took
second place.

317
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:07,570
Colours and shapes now filled her mind with
pleasure beyond her powers to describe.

318
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,700
But most of all she was deeply fascinated
by the changing expressions on the faces of

319
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,600
people.

320
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:23,679
She viewed every face she saw as a new world
to explore, full of things to be discovered.

321
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:31,909
Every smile, every frown was wonderful to
her.

322
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:37,390
When Kathy finally left the hospital it was
as if she were leaving home for the first

323
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,899
time.

324
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:46,409
She was nervous but excited and her heart
felt light as she opened the door to leave.

325
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:52,559
Of course, all the newspapers were soon full
of the story:

326
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,519
AMERICAN SURGEON GIVES SIGHT TO BLIND WOMAN

327
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,600
THE GIFT OF SIGHT!

328
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,039
KATHY PAGE CAN SEE!

329
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:08,460
- Brilliant American doctor performs miracle
operation!

330
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,150
Woodrow Percival had tried to keep things
quiet, at least until he was sure that Kathy

331
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:20,480
had recovered fully from the operation, but
he couldn't stop the news from spreading any

332
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,759
more than he could stop the sun from rising.

333
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:30,130
Soon he had film companies wanting to make
a movie about him, publishers wanting his

334
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:36,260
life story and a long line of newspapers and
magazines wanting interviews.

335
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:43,269
The scientific community wanted to honour
him while businessmen saw many ways of marketing

336
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,539
his ideas.

337
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:53,770
Dr Woodrow Percival's future was looking very
bright indeed.

338
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,619
Kathy wanted to rest at home.

339
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,629
There was plenty for her to do there.

340
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:05,139
For the first time in her life she could actually
see her most valued possessions.

341
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:09,999
Best of all, she could see her friends for
the first time.

342
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:19,519
And, of course, her dear dog Trudy, who had
had to stay at home while she had been away.

343
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,259
Kathy discovered that the human face had a
powerful effect on her feelings.

344
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,270
It was as if there had been a great hunger
in her life that had been so much a part of

345
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,470
her that she had never questioned it.

346
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,950
Not until now.

347
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,940
She had never before realized what a smile
looked like, and it often moved her to tears

348
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,059
to see her friends smiling.

349
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,940
Then there was her taste in clothing.

350
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,509
Before, she had always had to depend on the
judgments of others to provide her with clothes

351
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,440
that felt comfortable but looked smart.

352
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,760
When she looked in her wardrobe she saw nothing
but dark colours or pale things that looked

353
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,659
like they had no colour at all.

354
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,960
'They've got to go!'

355
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,350
she said, as she took some of the clothes
out and threw them onto the floor.

356
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,570
She was determined that from now on she would
only wear clothes that were in colours she

357
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,570
liked.

358
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:29,400
After all, she could now decide for herself
what clothes she could wear!

359
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,940
She arranged to go shopping with Carla, her
agent, the very next day.

360
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,249
Trudy came, too.

361
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:43,389
Kathy had still not fully learned how to judge
distances very well, and Trudy was almost

362
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:48,360
as useful to her now as she had been before.

363
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,460
Kathy enjoyed choosing her new clothes.

364
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,570
She was surprised at how good she looked in
them.

365
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,929
It was a feeling she liked.

366
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:03,940
As Kathy was paying for them, Carla - who
had a particular interest in fashion - said,

367
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,780
'Well, Kathy, you've certainly brightened
up your wardrobe now!

368
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,970
I like the new look; it suits you!'

369
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,399
Kathy had bought clothing that was food for
her eyes.

370
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:23,480
Her clothes had always been rather dull before
- more than she had realized.

371
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,960
These new clothes were colourful and cheerful.

372
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,299
They made her feel happy.

373
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,179
Kathy found that she was watching a lot of
television.

374
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,230
She had never really bothered with it before.

375
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,720
Now she watched it with deep interest.

376
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,649
Quiz and game show presenters, and singers
smiled all the time against a background of

377
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,720
bright colours.

378
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,220
Their smiles made them seem to be such lovely
honest people, yet on the few occasions she

379
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:02,980
had listened to such shows before her operation
she had thought they sounded stupid and shallow.

380
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,059
It was confusing but she was almost too happy
to care.

381
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,409
Almost.

382
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:14,780
Kathy discovered that she could now dream
in colour and with pictures, too!

383
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,889
Before this her dreams were made of sounds,
voices and music.

384
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:26,580
Now she could also see in her dreams and she
was delighted.

385
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,000
She took up photography and loved to see how
pictures from life could be caught by the

386
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,669
camera, like frozen pieces of memory.

387
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:43,730
The next thing to do was to go to a museum
with Carla to see paintings by great artists,

388
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,019
just as she had always wanted!

389
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:49,559
She could hardly wait.

390
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,830
Kathy was used to getting up early - she loved
the colours of the early morning - and she

391
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,649
planned to visit as many London museums as
she could during the day.

392
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:06,249
By eight thirty in the morning she had had
her breakfast and was dressed and ready to

393
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:07,249
leave.

394
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:10,320
The doorbell rang.

395
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,220
Kathy went to the door.

396
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,700
She was expecting to see Carla.

397
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,629
But it wasn't Carla; it was a young man who
was smiling at her.

398
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,299
He had a nice smile, she thought.

399
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,049
'Hello, Miss Page.

400
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,539
We've met before.

401
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,070
You may remember me from the television studios.

402
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,710
My name is Mick Dean.'

403
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,450
Kathy had not been to a studio since before
her operation.

404
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,559
She had decided to take at least one year
off work, no matter how the operation turned

405
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,210
out.

406
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,940
She had been thinking of writing a book about
her life.

407
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,230
It would be a challenge and she liked challenges.

408
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:01,330
But now she had a new challenge: Mick Dean
had given her a television show of her own

409
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,940
to present.

410
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,259
He had wanted her to do it so much, he had
told her, that he just had to talk to her

411
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,259
himself.

412
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:15,729
And that was exactly what he had done: he
had just turned up at her door.

413
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,320
It was totally unexpected.

414
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,269
She probably would not have spoken to him
otherwise.

415
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:26,309
Kathy decided she liked him for it.

416
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,610
She had never really taken much notice of
Mick Dean before.

417
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:36,620
In fact, she remembered that he had sounded
far too sure of himself for her liking.

418
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,519
But she must have been mistaken.

419
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,190
He had offered tier her own show where she
could interview people in the news.

420
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,820
He had looked so honest and enthusiastic about
it that she thought she really ought to give

421
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,929
the show a chance.

422
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,019
And he had such a nice smile.

423
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:01,659
His teeth were lovely and white, apart from
the shiny gold one at the side, which was

424
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,859
rather attractive.

425
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,000
And his eyes!

426
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,130
She had never realized that eyes could be
so... so colourful!

427
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:20,409
His eyes were a lovely blue with a few fine
little red lines around the white parts.

428
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,980
Kathy decided she would do the show.

429
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,789
Just one - to see what it was like.

430
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:33,080
Three months later the show was ready and
about to start.

431
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,350
Kathy had soon got used to all the things
that went on in a television studio: all the

432
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:44,419
lights, the people who were needed to make
sure everything worked right and, of course,

433
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:50,500
the excited studio audience waiting for the
show to begin.

434
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,510
Kathy was behind the scenes, wearing her new
cheerful clothes and drinking a cup of tea.

435
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:02,929
She was reading Braille notes with her fingertips
- it was still quicker than trying to read

436
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:10,560
written notes - about her first guest, an
ageing actor called Archie Mason.

437
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,260
He had written a book about his life in which
he had told his readers all about his wives,

438
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,000
his lovers and the famous actors he had known.

439
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,490
He had given away a great many details about
their private lives and the kinds of things

440
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,070
they did.

441
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,440
This had, of course, guaranteed big sales
of his book.

442
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,059
Kathy was sure that much of what he had written
wasn't true and her aim in the interview was

443
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:42,099
to make him admit it.

444
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:46,809
When the show began, Kathy was given a warm
welcome.

445
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:53,129
The audience was glad to see her back, though
there were a few surprised looks at her colourful

446
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:55,770
choice of dress.

447
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,920
Archie Mason was introduced and he made his
entrance.

448
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,990
He was a man in late middle age, with dark
hair, a moustache and dressed in a smart blue

449
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,450
suit with a red tie and white shirt.

450
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:19,880
He was still handsome and knew it as he smiled
at the audience with his perfect white teeth,

451
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,760
waving and showing an expensive gold watch
on his wrist.

452
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,000
He then turned his smile to Kathy as he gave
her a kiss on the cheek before sitting down.

453
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,700
'He has a nice smile,' Kathy thought as she
looked at his perfectly shaped teeth.

454
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,180
She liked to see things that were bright and
evenly shaped.

455
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,530
Kathy at once started to question Archie Mason
about some of the more doubtful details of

456
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,859
his book.

457
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:57,660
'I swear to you, Kathy, that nothing in my
book is untrue.

458
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:04,869
Honest,' said Archie as he smiled and showed
his white teeth.

459
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:11,040
Kathy's ears were hearing a voice that did
not sound honest at all, but her eyes saw

460
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,809
a big warm smile that looked open and truthful.

461
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:22,150
Her brain listened to her ears but her heart
looked at the smile.

462
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:28,220
It was hard to believe that a man with a smile
like that could ever lie.

463
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,619
For the first time during a live interview
she doubted her judgment.

464
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:37,510
She decided to believe him.

465
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:42,569
From that moment on she was no longer sure
of her own judgment.

466
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:48,930
To the audience, it seemed as if Archie was
the one in control, not Kathy.

467
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:56,270
So long as he gave her a big smile he could
say whatever he liked.

468
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:01,700
Kathy simply nodded and said 'yes' and 'really?'

469
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,510
to him.

470
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,250
This was not what the audience expected.

471
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,109
Where was the Kathy Page they knew?

472
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:16,880
She should have known right away how to deal
with a self- important old fool like this.

473
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,329
Her next guest was a politician who had broken
some of his election promises.

474
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:30,470
At least, everybody thought, she would sort
him out; he was more like what she was used

475
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,470
to.

476
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,369
But the politician had been prepared well.

477
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:39,299
He had a boyish look, though he was well over
forty.

478
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:44,369
But, most of all, he had a nice smile.

479
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:49,321
She didn't know what to think of all the different
signals she was getting from this man: his

480
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:55,420
voice told her not to trust him while his
smile told her he was honest.

481
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,059
She could no longer trust her judgment.

482
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:01,920
She felt confused.

483
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,619
The politician said almost anything he wanted.

484
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:11,430
Kathy knew she should have been asking more
questions but she just didn't have the confidence

485
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,940
in her abilities anymore.

486
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,829
She was too slow and the politician was too
quick.

487
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,900
After the show, Kathy knew she had done badly.

488
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,119
She felt terrible.

489
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,369
She was not surprised when she heard, not
long afterwards, that her show would not be

490
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:33,420
put on again.

491
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,980
She heard no more from Mick Dean.

492
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,450
Kathy finally found the time to write her
autobiography.

493
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,450
She began it soon after her appearance on
television.

494
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:54,130
It took her almost a year, but it became a
huge success and made her a lot of money.

495
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,170
Once again, she was in public demand.

496
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:05,039
Because of her renewed popularity, she was
asked by a different producer to make another

497
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,500
television show.

498
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,059
She turned down the offer.

499
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:13,289
She didn't want to go through that again!

500
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:21,430
Instead, she decided to return to radio and
soon her old show was back.

501
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,830
Kathy wanted to show her fans that she was
as good as ever.

502
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:31,170
As her first guest, she chose the politician
she had interviewed during, her disastrous

503
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,010
television show.

504
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:37,660
Naturally, he expected an easy time of it
again.

505
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,640
He smiled as he looked at Kathy across the
table.

506
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,799
He didn't smile for long.

507
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:50,880
'Could you tell us, Minister, about your promise
to reduce unemployment?'

508
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,740
she asked him.

509
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,980
The minister began.

510
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:00,579
'Of course, Kathy, but you must realize these
things take a long time...'

511
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:02,160
'Oh really?

512
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,990
That's not what you said last month.'

513
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:12,210
She then went on to tear him apart, taking
each of his promises in turn and showing how

514
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,039
they had all been broken.

515
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,990
He was, before a listening audience of millions,
shown to be false and dishonest, just as she

516
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,559
had first thought.

517
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:28,839
This was what her listeners had been waiting
for!

518
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:36,750
As the politician left, Kathy sat back and
took off the black scarf she had tied around

519
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:42,549
her head to cover her eyes throughout the
interview.

520
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:48,380
Kathy Page - the queen of radio interviews
and star of her listeners - was back!

521
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,420
- THE END -
