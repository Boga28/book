1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,480
Ant.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,600
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,340
But how I caught it, found it, or came by
it,

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,739
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
⁠

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,120
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,980
That I have much ado to know myself.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,980
Salar.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,080
Your mind is tossing on the ocean; ⁠
There, where your argosies with portly sail,—

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,950
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,—

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,370
Do overpeer the petty traffickers, ⁠
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,190
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,190
Salan.

13
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,539
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would ⁠

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,050
Be with my hopes abroad.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,829
I should be still
Plucking the grass to know where sits the

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,089
wind;
Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and

17
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,549
roads;
And every object that might make me fear ⁠

18
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,920
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would
make me sad.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,939
Salar.⁠My wind, cooling my broth,
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought

20
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,720
What harm a wind too great might do at sea.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,900
⁠
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,630
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand

23
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,530
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs ⁠
To kiss her burial.

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,860
Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,490
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side

26
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,119
⁠
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,

27
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,220
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks;
And, in a word, but even now worth this,

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,270
And now worth nothing?

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,850
Shall I have the thought ⁠
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,070
That such a thing bechanc'd would make me
sad?

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,409
But tell not me: I know Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

32
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,409
⁠

33
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,409
Ant.

34
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,330
Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,

35
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,269
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year: ⁠

36
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,959
Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad.

37
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,959
Salar.

38
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,560
Why, then you are in love.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,090
Ant.⁠Fie, fie!

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,090
Salar.

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,090
Not in love neither?

42
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,560
Then let's say you are sad.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
⁠

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,890
For you to laugh and leap, and say you are
merry,

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,800
Because you are not sad.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,500
Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,350
time:
Some that will evermore peep through their

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,450
eyes ⁠
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,

49
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,900
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,400
smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
⁠

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,830
Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.

53
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,830
Salan.

54
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,680
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano, and Lorenzo.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,160
Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Salar.

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,690
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
⁠

58
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,060
If worthier friends had not prevented me.

59
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
Ant.

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,510
Your worth is very dear in my regard.

61
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,689
I take it, your own business calls on you,
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

62
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,689
⁠

63
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:31,689
Salar.

64
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,689
Good morrow, my good lords.

65
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,689
Bass.

66
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,739
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?

67
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,090
say when?

68
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,870
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

69
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
Salar.

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,690
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

71
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,989
[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio.]

72
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:47,989
Lor.

73
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,760
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
⁠

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,379
We too will leave you; but, at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

75
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,379
Bass.

76
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,379
I will not fail you.

77
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,379
⁠

78
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,379
Gra.

79
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,230
You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:

80
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,669
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd.

81
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:11,669
⁠

82
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,669
Ant.

83
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,030
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,

84
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,020
And mine a sad one.

85
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,570
Gra.⁠Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,

86
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,820
⁠
And let my liver rather heat with wine

87
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,440
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,740
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,880
⁠
Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,370
By being peevish?

91
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,509
I tell thee what, Antonio—
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks—

92
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,710
There are a sort of men whose visages ⁠
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,

93
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,880
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion

94
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,699
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit; ⁠
As who should say, 'I am Sir Oracle,

95
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:06,900
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'

96
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,870
O, my Antonio, I do know of these,
That therefore only are reputed wise ⁠

97
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,990
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those

98
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,650
ears
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers

99
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,650
fools.

100
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,930
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
⁠

101
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,490
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool-gudgeon, this opinion.

102
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,050
Come, good Lorenzo.

103
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,010
Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

104
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,010
⁠

105
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,010
Lor.

106
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,710
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.

107
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,960
I must be one of these same dumb-wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Gra.

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,560
Well, keep me company but two years moe, ⁠
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
tongue.

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Ant.

112
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Gra.

114
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,439
Thanks, i' faith; for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

115
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,439
⁠

116
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,439
Exit [Gratiano with Lorenzo].

117
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,439
Ant.

118
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,439
Is that anything now?

119
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,439
Bass.

120
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,539
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of
nothing, more than any man in all Venice.

121
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,900
His
reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in

122
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,120
two ⁠
bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,270
you
find them, and, when you have them, they are

124
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,820
not worth the search.

125
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Ant.

126
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,979
Well, tell me now, what lady is the same ⁠
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,

127
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,120
That you to-day promis'd to tell me of?

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Bass.

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,330
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate, ⁠

130
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:51,380
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:

131
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,770
Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd
From such a noble rate; but my chief care

132
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,069
⁠
Is, to come fairly off from the great debts

133
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:07,930
Wherein my time, something too prodigal,
Hath left me gag'd.

134
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,190
To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love; ⁠

135
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,930
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburthen all my plots and purposes

136
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,850
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

137
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
Ant.

138
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,540
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
⁠

139
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,440
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assur'd,

140
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,529
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

141
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,529
⁠

142
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,529
Bass.

143
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:45,110
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight

144
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,590
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring

145
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,419
both, ⁠
I oft found both.

146
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:03,310
I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.

147
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:12,500
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please

148
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,819
⁠
To shoot another arrow that self way

149
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:23,199
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,

150
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,360
Or bring your latter hazard back again, ⁠
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Ant.

152
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,640
You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;

153
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,459
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
⁠

154
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:43,440
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:51,350
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,

156
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,800
⁠
And I am prest unto it: therefore speak.

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Bass.

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,250
In Belmont is a lady richly left,
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,

159
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,550
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
⁠

160
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:15,370
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia; nothing undervalu'd

161
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,959
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,

162
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
⁠
For the four winds blow in from every coast

163
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,370
Renowned suitors; and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;

164
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,800
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strond,
⁠

165
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,019
And many Jasons come in quest of her.

166
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,260
O my Antonio!

167
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,570
had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,

168
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,070
I have a mind presages me such thrift, ⁠
That I should questionless be fortunate.

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,070
Ant.

170
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,779
Thou knowest that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money, nor commodity

171
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,080
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
⁠

172
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,750
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,

173
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,320
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.

174
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Go, presently inquire, and so will I, ⁠
Where money is, and I no question make

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,370
To have it of my trust or for my sake.

176
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,370
Exeunt.

177
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,370
Scene Two

178
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,370
[Belmont.

179
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,370
A Room in Portia's House]

180
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,560
Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.

181
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Por.

182
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,660
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is
aweary of this great world.

183
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Ner.

184
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,660
You would be, sweet madam, if your
miseries were in the same abundance as your

185
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,500
⁠
good fortunes are: and yet, for aught I see,

186
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,329
they
are as sick that surfeit with too much as

187
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,300
they
that starve with nothing.

188
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,430
It is no mean happi-
ness therefore to be seated in the mean: ⁠

189
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,370
superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.

190
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,370
Por.

191
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,060
Good sentences and well pronounced.

192
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Ner.

193
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,660
They would be better if well followed.

194
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
⁠

195
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Por.

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,290
If to do were as easy as to know what
were good to do, chapels had been churches,

197
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,430
and
poor men's cottages princes' palaces.

198
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,980
It is a
good divine that follows his own instructions:

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,850
I ⁠
can easier teach twenty what were good to

200
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,960
be
done, than be one of the twenty to follow

201
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,889
mine
own teaching.

202
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,060
The brain may devise laws for
the blood, but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold

203
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,800
⁠
decree: such a hare is madness the youth,

204
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,950
to
skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple.

205
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,450
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose

206
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,040
me a husband.

207
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,620
O me, the word 'choose!'

208
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,940
I may ⁠
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom

209
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,134
I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter
curbed by the will of a dead father.

210
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:54,350
Is it not
hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor

211
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,600
⁠
refuse none?

212
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Ner.

213
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,260
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy
men at their death have good inspirations;

214
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,160
therefore, the lottery that he hath devised
in these ⁠

215
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,930
three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof
who chooses his meaning chooses you, will,

216
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,769
no
doubt, never be chosen by any rightly but

217
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,690
one
who you shall rightly love.

218
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,850
But what warmth ⁠
is there in your affection towards any of

219
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,440
these
princely suitors that are already come?

220
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Por.

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,930
I pray thee, over-name them, and as
thou namest them, I will describe them; and,

222
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,740
⁠
according to my description, level at my affection.

223
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
Ner.

224
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,810
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.

225
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,810
Por.

226
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,340
Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth
nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes

227
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,720
it a ⁠
great appropriation to his own good parts

228
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,230
that
he can shoe him himself.

229
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,970
I am much afeard
my lady his mother played false with a smith.

230
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Ner.

231
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,769
Then is there the County Palatine.

232
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:56,769
⁠

233
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:57,769
Por.

234
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:03,790
He doth nothing but frown, as who
should say, 'An you will not have me, choose.'

235
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,779
He hears merry tales, and smiles not: I fear
he

236
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,480
will prove the weeping philosopher when he
⁠

237
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,630
grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness
in his youth.

238
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,389
I had rather be married to a
death's-head with a bone in his mouth than

239
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,019
to
either of these.

240
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,970
God defend me from these two!

241
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,970
⁠

242
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,970
Ner.

243
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,440
How say you by the French lord,
Monsieur Le Bon?

244
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Por.

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
God made him, and therefore let him pass
for a man.

246
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,380
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a ⁠
mocker; but, he!

247
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,671
why, he hath a horse better
than the Neapolitan's, a better bad habit

248
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,650
of
frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every

249
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,440
man in no man; if a throstle sing, he falls
⁠

250
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,790
straight a-capering; he will fence with his
own

251
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,170
shadow: if I should marry him, I should marry
twenty husbands.

252
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,149
If he would despise me, I
would forgive him, for if he love me to madness,

253
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:58,670
⁠
I shall never requite him.

254
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,670
Ner.

255
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,720
What say you, then, to Falconbridge,
the young baron of England?

256
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Por.

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,589
You know I say nothing to him, for he ⁠
understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither

258
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,120
Latin, French, nor Italian; and you will come
into the court and swear that I have a poor

259
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,259
pennyworth in the English.

260
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,600
He is a proper ⁠
man's picture, but, alas!

261
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,720
who can converse with
a dumb-show?

262
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,880
How oddly he is suited!

263
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,459
I think
he bought his doublet in Italy, his round

264
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:32,670
hose in
France, his bonnet in Germany, and his be-

265
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,670
⁠
haviour everywhere.

266
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,670
Ner.

267
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,610
What think you of the Scottish lord, his
neighbour?

268
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,610
Por.

269
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,839
That he hath a neighbourly charity in ⁠
him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the

270
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,160
Englishman, and swore he would pay him again
when he was able: I think the Frenchman be-

271
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,050
came his surety and sealed under for another.

272
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,050
⁠

273
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,050
Ner.

274
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,650
How like you the young German, the
Duke of Saxony's nephew?

275
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,650
Por.

276
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,981
Very vilely in the morning, when he is
sober, and most vilely in the afternoon, when

277
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,980
he ⁠
is drunk: when he is best, he is a little

278
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,899
worse
than a man, and when he is worst, he is little

279
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,139
better than a beast.

280
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,050
An the worst fall that ever
fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without

281
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,050
him.

282
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,050
⁠

283
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,050
Ner.

284
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,730
If he should offer to choose, and choose
the right casket, you should refuse to perform

285
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,860
your father's will, if you should refuse to
accept

286
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
him.

287
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
⁠

288
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Por.

289
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,130
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray
thee, set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on

290
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,529
the
contrary casket, for, if the devil be within

291
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,989
and
that temptation without, I know he will choose

292
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:35,989
⁠
it.

293
00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:39,829
I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be
married to a sponge.

294
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:40,829
Ner.

295
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:45,800
You need not fear, lady, the having any
of these lords: they have acquainted me with

296
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,569
⁠
their determinations; which is, indeed, to

297
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:51,569
return
to their home and to trouble you with no more

298
00:15:51,569 --> 00:15:55,060
suit, unless you may be won by some other
sort

299
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,550
than your father's imposition depending on
the ⁠

300
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,550
caskets.

301
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,550
Por.

302
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,360
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will
die

303
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,589
as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by
the

304
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,120
manner of my father's will.

305
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,690
I am glad this ⁠
parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there

306
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:17,110
is not one among them but I dote on his very
absence, and I pray God grant them a fair

307
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,110
departure.

308
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,110
⁠

309
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,110
Ner.

310
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,410
Do you not remember, lady, in your
father's time, a Venetian, a scholar and a

311
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,880
soldier,
that came hither in the company of the Marquis

312
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,100
of Montferrat?

313
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
⁠

314
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Por.

315
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,269
Yes, yes: it was Bassanio; as I think, he
was so called.

316
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,269
Ner.

317
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:41,250
True, madam: he, of all the men that
ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the

318
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,509
best ⁠
deserving a fair lady.

319
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,509
Por.

320
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,820
I remember him well, and I remember
him worthy of thy praise.

321
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Enter a Servingman.

322
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
How now!

323
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
what news?

324
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
⁠

325
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Serv.

326
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,529
The four strangers seek for you, madam,
to take their leave; and there is a forerunner

327
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,620
come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco,
who

328
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,139
brings word the prince his master will be
here ⁠

329
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,139
to-night.

330
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,139
⁠Por.

331
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,970
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so
⁠good heart as I can bid the other four

332
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,280
farewell,
⁠I should be glad of his approach: if he

333
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,380
have the ⁠
⁠condition of a saint and the complexion

334
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,459
of a devil,
⁠I had rather he should shrive me than wive

335
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,459
me.

336
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,459
Come, Nerissa.

337
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,459
Sirrah, go before.

338
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,710
Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another
knocks at the door.

339
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,710
Exeunt.

340
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,710
Scene Three

341
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,710
[Venice.

342
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,710
A public Place]

343
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,710
Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.

344
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,710
Shy.

345
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,510
Three thousand ducats; well?

346
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,510
Bass.

347
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,450
Ay, sir, for three months.

348
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,450
Shy.

349
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,860
For three months; well?

350
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
Bass.

351
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,840
For the which, as I told you, Antonio ⁠
shall be bound.

352
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Shy.

353
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,660
Antonio shall become bound; well?

354
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
Bass.

355
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,690
May you stead me?

356
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,470
Will you pleasure
me?

357
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,140
Shall I know your answer?

358
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
⁠

359
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
Shy.

360
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:03,780
Three thousand ducats, for three
months, and Antonio bound.

361
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,050
Bass.

362
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,610
Your answer to that.

363
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,610
Shy.

364
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,360
Antonio is a good man.

365
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
⁠

366
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Bass.

367
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,020
Have you heard any imputation to the
contrary?

368
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Shy.

369
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:26,270
Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying
he is a good man is to have you understand

370
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,840
me ⁠
that he is sufficient.

371
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,970
Yet his means are in sup-
position: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis,

372
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:50,200
another to the Indies; I understand moreover
upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico,

373
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,360
a ⁠
fourth for England, and other ventures he

374
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,260
hath,
squandered abroad.

375
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:12,470
But ships are but boards,
sailors but men: there be land-rats and water-

376
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,780
rats, land-thieves, and water-thieves,—I
mean ⁠

377
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:26,480
pirates,—and then there is the peril of
waters,

378
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:34,159
winds, and rocks.

379
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,450
The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient.

380
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,940
Three thousand ducats; I think, I
may take his bond.

381
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
⁠

382
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,940
Bass.

383
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Be assured you may.

384
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Shy.

385
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:54,980
I will be assured I may; and, that I may
be assured, I will bethink me.

386
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,759
May I speak with
Antonio?

387
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,759
⁠

388
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,759
Bass.

389
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,640
If it please you to dine with us.

390
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Shy.

391
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:11,190
Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habita-
tion which your prophet the Nazarite conjured

392
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,440
the devil into.

393
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,360
I will buy with you, sell with you, ⁠
talk with you, walk with you, and so following;

394
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,380
but I will not eat with you, drink with you,
nor

395
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,020
pray with you.

396
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,750
What news on the Rialto?

397
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,320
Who
is he comes here?

398
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
⁠

399
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Enter Antonio.

400
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Bass.

401
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
This is Signior Antonio.

402
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Shy.

403
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
[Aside.]

404
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,080
How like a fawning publican he looks!

405
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,590
I hate him for he is a Christian;
But more for that in low simplicity ⁠

406
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,670
He lends out money gratis, and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.

407
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:53,670
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear

408
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,710
him.

409
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,220
⁠
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,

410
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:07,109
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,

411
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:09,299
Which he calls interest.

412
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,150
Cursed be my tribe, ⁠
If I forgive him!

413
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,150
Bass.

414
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,150
Shylock, do you hear?

415
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Shy.

416
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,520
I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,

417
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,419
I cannot instantly raise up the gross ⁠
Of full three thousand ducats.

418
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,260
What of that?

419
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,080
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me.

420
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,090
But soft!

421
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,840
how many months
Do you desire?

422
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
[To Antonio.]

423
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,700
Rest you fair, good signior; ⁠
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

424
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Ant.

425
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,950
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,

426
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,630
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
⁠

427
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,770
I'll break a custom.

428
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,770
[To Bassanio.]

429
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,730
Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

430
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,140
Shy.⁠Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

431
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Ant.

432
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,700
And for three months.

433
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Shy.

434
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,809
I had forgot; three months; you told me so.

435
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:18,659
⁠
Well then, your bond; and let me see.

436
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,630
But hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow

437
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,740
Upon advantage.

438
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,090
Ant.⁠I do never use it.

439
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,090
Shy.

440
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:35,240
When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep,—
This Jacob from our holy Abram was, ⁠

441
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,650
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor: ay, he was the third,—

442
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,650
Ant.

443
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,650
And what of him?

444
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,040
did he take interest?

445
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
⁠

446
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Shy.

447
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,909
No; not take interest; not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.

448
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:59,759
When Laban and himself were compromis'd,
That all the eanlings which were streak'd

449
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,010
and pied ⁠
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being

450
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,270
rank,
In end of autumn turned to the rams;

451
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,850
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,

452
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,179
⁠
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,

453
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,470
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,

454
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:30,080
Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time ⁠
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were

455
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Jacob's.

456
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,230
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

457
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,230
Ant.

458
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,659
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd
for;

459
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,540
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
⁠

460
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,620
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.

461
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,549
Was this inserted to make interest good?

462
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:52,861
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

463
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:53,861
⁠

464
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:54,861
Shy.

465
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:59,860
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.

466
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,299
Ant.⁠Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

467
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,419
An evil soul, producing holy witness, ⁠
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,

468
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,740
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.

469
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,210
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

470
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,210
Shy.

471
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,800
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.

472
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,220
Three months from twelve, then let me see
the rate.

473
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
⁠

474
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Ant.

475
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,750
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

476
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,750
Shy.

477
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,380
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me ⁠

478
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,899
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,

479
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,090
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

480
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,170
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog, ⁠
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,

481
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,750
And all for use of that which is mine own.

482
00:24:50,750 --> 00:25:00,480
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to then; you come to me, and you say, ⁠

483
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,539
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,

484
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:12,330
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.

485
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,919
⁠
What should I say to you?

486
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,230
Should I not say,
'Hath a dog money?

487
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,669
Is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?'

488
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,460
or
Shall I bend low, and in a bondman's key,

489
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,010
⁠
With bated breath, and whispering humbleness,

490
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,789
Say this:—
'Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;

491
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:37,720
You spurn'd me such a day; another time ⁠
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies

492
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,070
I'll lend you thus much moneys?'

493
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,070
Ant.

494
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:47,080
I am as like to call thee so again,
To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.

495
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,201
⁠
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not

496
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:52,350
As to thy friends,—for when did friendship
take

497
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,919
A breed for barren metal of his friend?—
But lend it rather to thine enemy; ⁠

498
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,920
Who if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.

499
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,149
Shy.⁠Why, look you, how you storm!

500
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,650
I would be friends with you, and have your
love,

501
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,230
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me
with, ⁠

502
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,950
Supply your present wants, and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear

503
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,789
me:
This is kind I offer.

504
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,789
Bass.

505
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,669
This were kindness.

506
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:27,440
Shy.⁠This kindness will I show.

507
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,200
⁠
Go with me to a notary, seal me there

508
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,650
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,

509
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,380
In such a place, such sum or sums as are ⁠
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit

510
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,850
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken

511
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,650
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

512
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,650
⁠

513
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,650
Ant.

514
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,039
Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond,
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

515
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,039
Bass.

516
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:02,570
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

517
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,570
⁠

518
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,570
Ant.

519
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,799
Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before

520
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,239
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

521
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,239
⁠

522
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,239
Shy.

523
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,239
O father Abram!

524
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:23,710
what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect

525
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,500
The thoughts of others.

526
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I

527
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,630
gain ⁠
By the exaction of the forfeiture?

528
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:40,880
A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man,
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,

529
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,690
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

530
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,160
I say, ⁠
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:

531
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:55,309
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

532
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,309
Ant.

533
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

534
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
⁠

535
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Shy.

536
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,890
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,

537
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,960
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard

538
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,429
⁠
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently

539
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,630
I will be with you.

540
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,630
Exit.

541
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,710
Ant.⁠Hie thee, gentle Jew.

542
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,370
This Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows
kind.

543
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,370
Bass.

544
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,750
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

545
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,750
⁠

546
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Ant.

547
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:55,289
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month 

548
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:09,289
before 

549
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,680
the day.

550
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,860
Exeunt.

551
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,049
Mor.

552
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,240
Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,

553
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,559
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

554
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,070
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
⁠

555
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,169
Where Phœbus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,

556
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,370
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.

557
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:46,250
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine ⁠
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love, I swear

558
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,539
The best regarded virgins of our clime
Have lov'd it too: I would not change this

559
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,850
hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

560
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,850
⁠

561
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,850
Por.

562
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,460
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;

563
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,299
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing: ⁠

564
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:10,410
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedg'd me by his wit, to yield myself

565
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,870
His wife who wins me by that means I told
you,

566
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,720
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
⁠

567
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,400
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.

568
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Mor.⁠Even for that I thank you:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets

569
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,789
To try my fortune.

570
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:30,409
By this scimitar,— ⁠
That slew the Sophy, and a Persian prince

571
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:37,289
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,—
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,

572
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:40,350
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
⁠

573
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:46,830
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,

574
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,460
To win thee, lady.

575
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,279
But, alas the while!

576
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,149
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice ⁠
Which is the better man, the greater throw

577
00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:01,649
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;

578
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:08,240
And so may I, blind fortune leading me, ⁠
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,

579
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,389
And die with grieving.

580
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:13,830
Por.⁠You must take your chance;
And either not attempt to choose at all,

581
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,059
Or swear before you choose, if you choose
wrong, ⁠

582
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,419
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advis'd.

583
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:22,419
Mor.

584
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,690
Nor will not: come, bring me unto my chance.

585
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,690
Por.

586
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,480
First, forward to the temple: after dinner
⁠

587
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,190
Your hazard shall be made.

588
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,720
Mor.⁠Good fortune then!

589
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,380
To make me blest or cursed'st among men!

590
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,380
Cornets.

591
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
Exeunt.

592
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Scene Two

593
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
[Venice.

594
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,380
A Street]

595
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Enter the Clown alone.

596
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Laun.

597
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,320
Certainly my conscience will serve me
to run from this Jew my master.

598
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:53,330
The fiend is
at mine elbow, and tempts me, saying to me,

599
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,519
'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,'
or ⁠

600
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:07,779
'good Gobbo,' or 'good Launcelot Gobbo, use
your legs, take the start, run away.'

601
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:13,549
My con-
science says, 'No; take heed, honest Launcelot;

602
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:17,500
take heed, honest Gobbo;' or, as aforesaid,
'honest ⁠

603
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:26,000
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running
with thy heels.'

604
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,169
Well, the most courageous fiend
bids me pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!'

605
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:39,570
says the fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up
a brave ⁠

606
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,090
mind,' says the fiend, 'and run.'

607
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,909
Well, my con-
science, hanging about the neck of my heart,

608
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:57,849
says
very wisely to me, 'My honest friend Launcelot,

609
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:02,850
being an honest man's son,'—or rather an
honest ⁠

610
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,200
woman's son;—for, indeed, my father did
some-

611
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:22,360
thing smack, something grow to, he had a kind
of taste;—well, my conscience says, 'Launcelot,

612
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,620
budge not.'

613
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,909
'Budge,' says the fiend.

614
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,110
'Budge ⁠
not,' says my conscience.

615
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:39,970
'Conscience,' say I,
'you counsel well;' 'fiend,' say I, 'you counsel

616
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,220
well:'
to be ruled by my conscience, I should stay

617
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,570
with
the Jew my master, who, God bless the mark!

618
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,020
⁠
is a kind of devil; and, to run away from

619
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,500
the Jew,
I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving

620
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,980
your
reverence, is the devil himself.

621
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,570
Certainly, the
Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in

622
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,550
my con- ⁠
science, my conscience is but a kind of hard

623
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,800
con-
science, to offer to counsel me to stay with

624
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,909
the
Jew.

625
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:31,490
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel:
I will run, fiend; my heels are at your command-

626
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,520
⁠
ment; I will run.

627
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,080
Enter Old Gobbo, with a basket.

628
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
Gob.

629
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,380
Master young man, you; I pray you,
which is the way to Master Jew's?

630
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
Laun.

631
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
[Aside.]

632
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
O heavens!

633
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,720
this is my true- ⁠
begotten father, who, being more than sand-

634
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:58,030
blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not: I
will

635
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,350
try confusions with him.

636
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,350
Gob.

637
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,180
Master young gentleman, I pray you, ⁠
which is the way to Master Jew's?

638
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
Laun.

639
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:12,410
Turn up on your right hand at the
next turning, but, at the next turning of

640
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,510
all, on
your left; marry, at the very next turning,

641
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,050
turn ⁠
of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the

642
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,270
Jew's
house.

643
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,270
Gob.

644
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,310
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to
hit.

645
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:36,349
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, ⁠
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

646
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:37,369
Laun.

647
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,840
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

648
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
[Aside.]

649
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,990
Mark me now; now will I raise the
waters.

650
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,330
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

651
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,330
⁠

652
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,330
Gob.

653
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:57,110
No master, sir, but a poor man's son:
his father, though I say it, is an honest,

654
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:02,660
exceed-
ing poor man, and, God be thanked, well to

655
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
live.

656
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
⁠

657
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Laun.

658
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,080
Well, let his father be what a' will, we
talk of young Master Launcelot.

659
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Gob.

660
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,670
Your worship's friend, and Launcelot,
sir.

661
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,670
⁠

662
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,670
Laun.

663
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:24,720
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I be-
seech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot?

664
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,730
Gob.

665
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,160
Of Launcelot, an 't please your master-
ship.

666
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
⁠

667
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Laun.

668
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,200
Ergo, Master Launcelot.

669
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,640
Talk not of
Master Launcelot, father; for the young gentle-

670
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,480
man,—according to Fates and Destinies and
such

671
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,210
odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches
⁠

672
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,810
of learning,—is, indeed, deceased; or, as
you

673
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,670
would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.

674
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,670
Gob.

675
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,460
Marry, God forbid!

676
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,090
the boy was the very
staff of my age, my very prop.

677
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,090
⁠

678
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,090
Laun.

679
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,090
[Aside.]

680
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:13,849
Do I look like a cudgel or a
hovel-post, a staff or a prop?

681
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:15,880
Do you know me,
father?

682
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Gob.

683
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,050
Alack the day!

684
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,790
I know you not, young ⁠
gentleman: but I pray you, tell me, is my

685
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,370
boy,—
God rest his soul!—alive or dead?

686
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,370
Laun.

687
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,160
Do you not know me, father?

688
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Gob.

689
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,329
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you ⁠
not.

690
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,329
Laun.

691
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:42,880
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes,
you might fail of the knowing me: it is a

692
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,270
wise
father that knows his own child.

693
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:52,940
Well, old man, ⁠
I will tell you news of your son.

694
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,610
Give me your
blessing; truth will come to light; murder

695
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:02,410
can-
not be hid long; a man's son may, but, in

696
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,070
the
end, truth will out.

697
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,070
⁠

698
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,070
Gob.

699
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,070
Pray you, sir, stand up.

700
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,589
I am sure you
are not Launcelot, my boy.

701
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,589
Laun.

702
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:18,450
Pray you, let's have no more fooling
about it, but give me your blessing: I am

703
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,900
⁠
Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that

704
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,070
is,
your child that shall be.

705
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,070
Gob.

706
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,770
I cannot think you are my son.

707
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,770
Laun.

708
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:34,839
I know not what I shall think of that; ⁠
but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am

709
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,240
sure Margery your wife is my mother.

710
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Gob.

711
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,099
Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be
sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine

712
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,849
own ⁠
flesh and blood.

713
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,740
Lord worshipped might he be!

714
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,310
what a beard hast thou got!

715
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,900
thou hast got more
hair on thy chin than Dobbin my phill-horse

716
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,250
has
on his tail.

717
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,250
⁠

718
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,250
Laun.

719
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,740
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail
grows backward: I am sure he had more hair

720
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,740
on
his tail than I have on my face, when I last

721
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
saw
him.

722
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
⁠

723
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Gob.

724
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,740
Lord!

725
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
how art thou changed.

726
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,980
How dost
thou and thy master agree?

727
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,390
I have brought him
a present.

728
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,520
How 'gree you now?

729
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Laun.

730
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:29,500
Well, well: but, for mine own part, as ⁠
I have set up my rest to run away, so I will

731
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,470
not
rest till I have run some ground.

732
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:38,690
My master's a
very Jew: give him a present!

733
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:45,520
give him a halter:
I am famished in his service: you may tell

734
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,079
every ⁠
finger I have with my ribs.

735
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,910
Father, I am glad
you are come: give me your present to one

736
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:04,420
Master Bassanio, who, indeed, gives rare new
liveries.

737
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,619
If I serve not him, I will run as far ⁠
as God has any ground.

738
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,260
O rare fortune!

739
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,110
here
comes the man: to him, father; for I am a

740
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,780
Jew,
if I serve the Jew any longer.

741
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,810
Enter Bassanio, with a follower [Leonardo]
or two.

742
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,810
Bass.

743
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,520
You may do so; but let it be so hasted ⁠
that supper be ready at the farthest by five

744
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,970
of the clock.

745
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,990
See these letters delivered; put
the liveries to making; and desire Gratiano

746
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,599
to
come anon to my lodging.

747
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,599
⁠

748
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,599
[Exit a Servant.]

749
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,599
Laun.

750
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,599
To him, father.

751
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,599
Gob.

752
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,599
God bless your worship!

753
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,599
Bass.

754
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,599
Gramercy!

755
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,599
wouldst thou aught with
me?

756
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,599
⁠

757
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,599
Gob.

758
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,599
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,—

759
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,599
Laun.

760
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,010
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich
Jew's man; that would, sir,—as my father

761
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,490
shall
specify,— ⁠

762
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,490
Gob.

763
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,770
He hath a great infection, sir, as one
would say, to serve—

764
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,770
Laun.

765
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:15,170
Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve
the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall

766
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,170
⁠
specify,—

767
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,170
Gob.

768
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,730
His master and he, saving your wor-
ship's reverence, are scarce cater-cousins,—

769
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,630
Laun.

770
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:31,870
To be brief, the very truth is that the ⁠
Jew having done me wrong, doth cause me,—

771
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:39,290
as my father, being, I hope, an old man, shall
frutify unto you,—

772
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,290
Gob.

773
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,900
I have here a dish of doves that I ⁠
would bestow upon your worship, and my suit

774
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
is,—

775
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
Laun.

776
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,789
In very brief, the suit is impertinent
to myself, as your worship shall know by this

777
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:59,280
⁠
honest old man; and, though I say it, though

778
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,650
old man, yet poor man, my father.

779
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,119
Bass.

780
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,840
One speak for both.

781
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
What would you?

782
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Laun.

783
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Serve you, sir.

784
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
⁠

785
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Gob.

786
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,630
That is the very defect of the matter,
sir.

787
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,630
Bass.

788
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:21,339
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,

789
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:24,190
⁠
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment

790
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,110
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

791
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,110
Laun.

792
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:36,460
The old proverb is very well parted ⁠
between my master Shylock and you, sir: you

793
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,099
have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.

794
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,099
Bass.

795
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,920
Thou speak'st it well.

796
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,400
Go, father, with thy son.

797
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,900
Take leave of thy old master, and inquire
⁠

798
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
My lodging out.

799
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
[To his followers.]

800
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,940
Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

801
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Laun.

802
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,980
Father, in.

803
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:09,010
I cannot get a service, no;
I have ne'er a tongue in my head.

804
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,552
Well, [Look- ⁠
ing on his palm] if any man in Italy have

805
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:14,849
a
fairer table which doth offer to swear upon

806
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:18,260
a
book, I shall have good fortune.

807
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:24,859
Go to; here's
a simple line of life: here's a small trifle

808
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:26,510
of wives: ⁠
alas!

809
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:33,960
fifteen wives is nothing: a 'leven widows
and

810
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:43,520
nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man;
and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to

811
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,080
be in
peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;

812
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,300
⁠
here are simple 'scapes.

813
00:43:52,300 --> 00:44:00,310
Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she's a good wench for this gear.

814
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:04,700
Father,
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the

815
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,410
twinkling of an eye.

816
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,410
⁠

817
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,410
Exit Clown [with Old Gobbo].

818
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:09,410
Bass.

819
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,780
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought, and orderly bestowd,

820
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:20,550
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

821
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,550
⁠

822
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,550
Leon.

823
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,819
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

824
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:27,819
Enter Gratiano.

825
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:28,819
Gra.

826
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:29,829
Where is your master?

827
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,200
Leon.⁠Yonder, sir, he walks.

828
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
[Exit.]

829
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Gra.

830
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Signior Bassanio!—

831
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Bass.

832
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Gratiano!

833
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
⁠

834
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Gra.

835
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
I have a suit to you.

836
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Bass.⁠You have obtain'd it.

837
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
Gra.

838
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,609
You must not deny me: I must go with you to
Belmont.

839
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:43,609
Bass.

840
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:45,340
Why, then you must.

841
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:52,730
But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;

842
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,140
⁠
Parts that become thee happily enough,

843
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:03,340
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they

844
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,940
show
Something too liberal.

845
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,410
Pray thee, take pain ⁠
To allay with some cold drops of modesty

846
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,640
Thy skipping spirit, lest, through thy wild
behaviour,

847
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,390
I be misconstru'd in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.

848
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:26,349
Gra.⁠Signior Bassanio, hear me: ⁠
If I do not put on a sober habit,

849
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:31,530
Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,

850
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,970
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine
eyes ⁠

Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say 'amen;'
Use all the observance of civility,

To please his grandam, never trust me more.

I would entreat you rather to put on ⁠

Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment.

Jes.

870
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,530
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,

871
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,470
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.

872
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,790
But fare thee well; there is a ducat for thee:
⁠

did not play the knave and get thee, I am

much ⁠
deceived.

883

Alack, what heinous sin is it in me ⁠
To be asham'd to be my father's child!

But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners.

Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum,

Clamber not you up to the casements then,

Nor thrust your head into the public street

faces,

Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter

Mistress, look out ⁠
at window, for all this;

Will be worth a Jewess' eye.

The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

1018
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:13,349
More than the wild cat: drones hive not with
me; ⁠

1019
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:19,200
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste

1020
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,880

Perhaps I will return immediately: ⁠

1022

Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
'Fast bind, fast find,'

Jes.

1026
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,310
Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
⁠

1027
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,930
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

1028
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,930
Exit.

1029
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,930
Scene Six

1030
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:46,930
[The Same]

1031
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,630
Enter the Maskers, Gratiano and Salarino.

1032
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,630
Gra.

1033
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,859
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
Desir'd us to make stand.

1034
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,300
Salar.⁠His hour is almost past.

1035
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Gra.

1036
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,190
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.

1037
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,190
⁠

1038
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,190
Salar.

1039
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:08,250
O! ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are

1040
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,780
wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

1041
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Gra.

1042
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:17,300
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast ⁠
With that keen appetite that he sits down?

1043
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,280
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire

1044
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,720
That he did pace them first?

1045
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,859
All things that are, ⁠
Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.

1046
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:33,010
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,

1047
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,480
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!

1048
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,970
⁠
How like the prodigal doth she return,

1049
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:45,820
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent, and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

1050
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,380
Salar.

1051
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,420
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

1052
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,420
Enter Lorenzo.

1053
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
Lor.

1054
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,680
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
⁠

1055
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,950
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves

1056
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,890
for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then.

1057
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,470
Approach; ⁠
Here dwells my father Jew.

1058
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,470
Ho!

1059
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,240
who's within?

1060
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,480
[Enter] Jessica above [in boy's clothes].

1061
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,480
Jes.

1062
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,480
Who are you?

1063
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,400
Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

1064
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Lor.

1065
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,660
Lorenzo, and thy love.

1066
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,660
⁠

1067
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,660
Jes.

1068
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,140
Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed,
For whom love I so much?

1069
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,260
And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

1070
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,260
Lor.

1071
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,770
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou
art.

1072
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,770
⁠

1073
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,770
Jes.

1074
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,820
Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.

1075
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:48,980
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much asham'd of my exchange;

1076
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,160
But love is blind, and lovers cannot see ⁠
The pretty follies that themselves commit;

1077
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,480
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

1078
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,480
Lor.

1079
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,480
Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.

1080
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
⁠

1081
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Jes.

1082
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
What!

1083
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,930
must I hold a candle to my shames?

1084
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,260
They in themselves, good sooth, are too-too
light.

1085
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,150
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love,
And I should be obscur'd.

1086
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:21,540
Lor.⁠So are you, sweet, ⁠
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

1087
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,290
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,

1088
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,920
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

1089
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
⁠

1090
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
Jes.

1091
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,369
I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

1092
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:36,369
[Exit above.]

1093
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:37,369
Gra.

1094
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:40,030
Now, by my hood, a Gentile, and no Jew.

1095
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,030
Lor.

1096
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:46,520
Beshrew me, but I love her heartily; ⁠
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,

1097
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:53,250
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself;

1098
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,849
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and
true, ⁠

1099
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:03,260
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

1100
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,700
Enter Jessica.

1101
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,930
What art thou come?

1102
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,960
On, gentlemen; away!

1103
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,530
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

1104
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,780
Exit [with Jessica and Salarino].

1105
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,180
Enter Antonio.

1106
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,180
Ant.

1107
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,279
Who's there?

1108
00:57:20,279 --> 00:57:21,279
⁠

1109
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:22,279
Gra.

1110
00:57:22,279 --> 00:57:23,279
Signior Antonio!

1111
00:57:23,279 --> 00:57:24,279
Ant.

1112
00:57:24,279 --> 00:57:25,279
Fie, fie, Gratiano!

1113
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:26,279
where are all the rest?

1114
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,820
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for
you.

1115
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,680
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
⁠

1116
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,400
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

1117
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Gra.

1118
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,700
I am glad on 't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

1119
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
⁠Exeunt.

1120
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
Scene Seven

1121
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
[Belmont.

1122
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
A Room in Portia's House]

1123
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,300
Enter Portia, with Morocco, and both their
Trains.

1124
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,300
Por.

1125
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,630
Go, draw aside the curtains, and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.

1126
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,450
Now make your choice.

1127
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,450
Mor.

1128
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,900
The first, of gold, which this inscription
bears:

1129
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,119
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.

1130
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:07,480
⁠
The second, silver, which this promise carries:

1131
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,289
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

1132
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:16,000
This third, dull lead, with warning all as
blunt: ⁠

1133
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,609
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he
hath.

1134
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:22,990
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

1135
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:23,990
Por.

1136
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:29,010
The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

1137
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,010
⁠

1138
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,010
Mor.

1139
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,010
Some god direct my judgment!

1140
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:36,809
Let me see:
I will survey the inscriptions back again:

1141
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,869
What says this leaden casket?

1142
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:43,260
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he
hath.

1143
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,700
⁠
Must give: For what? for lead?

1144
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,580
hazard for lead?

1145
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,470
This casket threatens.

1146
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,390
Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:

1147
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,190
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
⁠

1148
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,960
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.

1149
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,000
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

1150
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,859
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

1151
00:59:06,859 --> 00:59:08,260
As much as he deserves!

1152
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,359
Pause there, Morocco, ⁠
And weigh thy value with an even hand.

1153
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,780
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough

1154
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,250
May not extend so far as to the lady: ⁠
And yet to be afeard of my deserving

1155
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,289
Were but a weak disabling of myself.

1156
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:28,880
As much as I deserve!

1157
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,990
Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,

1158
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,849
⁠
In graces, and in qualities of breeding;

1159
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:40,339
But more than these, in love I do deserve.

1160
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:44,580
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?

1161
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,700
Let's see once more this saying grav'd in
gold: ⁠

1162
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,970
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.

1163
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,700
Why, that's the lady: all the world desires
her;

1164
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,349
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing

1165
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:03,630
saint: ⁠
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds

1166
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:10,220
Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:

1167
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,770
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head ⁠
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar

1168
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:20,890
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.

1169
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,339
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

1170
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:26,080
⁠
Is 't like that lead contains her?

1171
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,990
'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross

1172
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,640
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.

1173
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,500
Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd,
⁠

1174
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,349
Being ten times undervalu'd to tried gold?

1175
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,670
O sinful thought!

1176
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,530
Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold.

1177
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:48,240
They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel ⁠

1178
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,960
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed

1179
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,589
Lies all within.

1180
01:00:55,589 --> 01:01:01,719
Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

1181
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:02,719
⁠

1182
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:03,719
Por.

1183
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,910
There, take it, prince; and if my form lie
there

1184
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:06,910
Then I am yours.

1185
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,320
[He unlocks the golden casket.]

1186
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
Mor.⁠O hell!

1187
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
what have we here?

1188
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:15,400
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll.

1189
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,530
I'll read the writing.

1190
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:18,530
⁠

1191
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,470
'All that glisters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:

1192
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,460
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold: ⁠

1193
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,980
Gilded tombs do worms infold.

1194
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,630
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,

1195
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:40,720
Your answer had not been inscroll'd: ⁠
Fare you well; your suit is cold.'

1196
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:47,070
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!

1197
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,250
Portia, adieu.

1198
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:55,029
I have too griev'd a heart ⁠
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

1199
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,800
Exit [with his Train].

1200
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,910
Por.

1201
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,230
A gentle riddance.

1202
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,730
Draw the curtains: go.

1203
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,890
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

1204
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,890
Flo[urish of] Cornets.

1205
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,890
Exeunt.

1206

Scene Eight

1207
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,890
[Venice.

1208
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:09,890
A Street]

1209
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,890
Enter Salarino and Salanio.

1210
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:11,890
Salar.

1211
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:15,690
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
With him is Gratiano gone along;

1212
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:19,130
And in their ship I'm sure Lorenzo is not.

1213
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:20,130
Salan.

1214
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,430
The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the duke,
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

1215
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,430
⁠

1216
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,430
Salar.

1217
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:31,720
He came too late, the ship was under sail:
But there the duke was given to understand

1218
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:37,960
That in a gondola were seen together ⁠
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.

1219
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:43,930
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

1220
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:44,930
Salan.

1221
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:49,950
I never heard a passion so confus'd, ⁠
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,

1222
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,270
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
'My daughter!

1223
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,430
O my ducats!

1224
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,119
O my daughter!

1225
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:57,119
Fled with a Christian!

1226
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,280
O my Christian ducats!

1227
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
⁠
Justice!

1228
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
the law!

1229
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,599
my ducats, and my daughter!

1230
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:09,490
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stol'n from me by my daughter!

1231
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,490
And jewels!

1232
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:15,130
two stones, two rich and precious stones,
Stol'n by my daughter!

1233
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,130
Justice!

1234
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,130
find the girl!

1235
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,350
⁠
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

1236
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,350
Salar.

1237
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:25,180
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his

1238
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,180
ducats.

1239
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,180
⁠

1240
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,180
Salan.

1241
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,310
Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.

1242
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,250
Salar.⁠Marry, well remember'd.

1243
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:38,270
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me,—in the narrow seas that part

1244
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:39,890
⁠
The French and English,—there miscarried

1245
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,180
A vessel of our country richly fraught.

1246
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:49,060
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

1247
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
⁠

1248
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,060
Salan.

1249
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,430
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

1250
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,430
Salar.

1251
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,680
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.

1252
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:04,809
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part: ⁠
Bassanio told him he would make some speed

1253
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:11,380
Of his return: he answer'd 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,

1254
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:17,380
But stay the very riping of the time; ⁠
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

1255
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:22,720
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts

1256
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,290
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
⁠

1257
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:33,180
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,

1258
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:39,130
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
And with affection wondrous sensible ⁠

1259
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,510
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

1260
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,510
Salan.

1261
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:45,799
I think he only loves the world for him.

1262
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:50,369
I pray thee, let us go and find him out,
And quicken his embraced heaviness ⁠

1263
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,000
With some delight or other.

1264
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,280
Salar.⁠Do we so.

1265
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280

1271
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,770
Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain
straight:

1272
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:06,170
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.

1273
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,480
Enter Arragon, his train, and Portia.

Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,

1277
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,460
⁠
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd;

1278
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:27,119
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.

1279
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,119

Ar.

1281
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:34,549
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one

1282
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:41,880
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life ⁠

1283
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,640
To woo a maid in way of marriage;
Lastly,

1284
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:50,520
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

1285

1287
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,799

That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

Ar.

1289
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,710
And so have I address'd me.

1290
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,390
Fortune now
To my heart's hope!

Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he

1293
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:15,619
hath:
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.

1294
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:17,110
What says the golden chest?

1295
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:24,819
ha! let me see:
Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.

1296
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:26,280
⁠
What many men desire!

1297
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:32,240
that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,

1298
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,200
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,
Which pries not to the interior, but, like

1299
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,170
the martlet, ⁠
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,

1300
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,150
Even in the force and road of casualty.

1301
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:50,030
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits

1302
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:52,360
⁠
And rank me with the barbarous multitude.

1303
01:06:52,360 --> 01:07:02,430
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:

1304
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:07,190
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

1305
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,349
⁠
And well said too; for who shall go about

1306
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:14,270
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit?

1307
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:18,699
Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.

1308
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:21,839
⁠
O! that estates, degrees, and offices

1309
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,240
Were not deriv'd corruptly, and that clear
honour

1310
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,390
Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer.

1311
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:31,430
How many then should cover that stand bare;
⁠

1312
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:37,400
How many be commanded that command;
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd

1313
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,400
From the true seed of honour; and how much
honour

1314
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,349
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
⁠

1315
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:46,319
To be new varnish'd!

1316
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:52,619
Well, but to my choice:
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.

Presenting me a schedule!

How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!

Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.

1330
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:23,410
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

1331
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,319
Is that my prize?

1332
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,140
are my deserts no better?

And of opposed natures.

Seven times tried that judgment is ⁠

Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:

1340

There be fools alive, I wis, ⁠
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.

1341
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,540
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:

1344
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,549
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here:

1345

With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.

⁠
Sweet, adieu.

1347
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,930
I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.

01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:44,370
Where is my lady?

1361
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,370
Por.⁠Here; what would my lord?

1362
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,370
Mes.

1363
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:48,270
Madam, there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian, one that comes before

1364
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:53,759
To signify the approaching of his lord; ⁠
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,

1365
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,280
To wit,—besides commends and courteous breath,—
Gifts of rich value.

1366
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,585
Yet I have not seen
So likely an embassador of love.

1367
01:09:59,585 --> 01:10:03,989
⁠
A day in April never came so sweet,

1368
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:08,929
To show how costly summer was at hand,
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

1369
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:09,929
Por.

1370
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:15,810
No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard ⁠
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,

1371
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,710
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising
him.

1372
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:25,870
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

1373
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,870
⁠

1374
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,870
Ner.

1375
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:39,429
Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

1376
01:10:39,429 --> 01:10:48,949
Exeunt.

1377
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:58,460
Salan.

1378
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:09,210
Now, what news on the Rialto?

1379
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,210
Salar.

1380
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:16,050
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that
Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked

1381
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,610
on
the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they

1382
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:22,470
call ⁠
the place; a very dangerous flat, and fatal,

1383
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:25,960
where
the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried,

1384
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,890
as
they say, if my gossip Report be an honest

1385
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,000
woman of her word.

1386
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
⁠

1387
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Salan.

1388
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,679
I would she were as lying a gossip in
that as ever knapped ginger, or made her neigh-

1389
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,570
bours believe she wept for the death of a
third

1390
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,570
husband.

1391
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:44,420
But it is true,—without any slips of ⁠
prolixity or crossing the plain highway of

1392
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,010
talk,
—that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—

1393
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,410
O, that I had a title good enough to keep
his

1394
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,600
name company!— ⁠

1395
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Salar.

1396
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,010
Come, the full stop.

1397
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,010
Salan.

1398
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,010
Ha!

1399
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,010
what sayst thou?

1400
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,210
Why, the end
is, he hath lost a ship.

1401
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,210
Salar.

1402
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,350
I would it might prove the end of his ⁠
losses.

1403
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:03,350
Salan.

1404
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:08,380
Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the
devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in

1405
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,540
the
likeness of a Jew.

1406
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:10,540
⁠

1407
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,540
Enter Shylock.

1408
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,540
How now, Shylock!

1409
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,710
what news among the
merchants?

1410
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,780
Shy.

1411
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:20,010
You knew, none so well, none so well as
you, of my daughter's flight.

1412
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,010
⁠

1413
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:22,010
Salar.

1414
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:25,940
That's certain: I, for my part, knew
the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.

1415
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
Salan.

1416
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,340
And Shylock, for his own part, knew
the bird was fledged; and then it is the com-

1417
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,620
⁠
plexion of them all to leave the dam.

1418
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,620
Shy.

1419
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,860
She is damned for it.

1420
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,860
Salar.

1421
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,860
That's certain, if the devil may be her
judge.

1422
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:40,860
⁠

1423
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:41,860
Shy.

1424
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,650
My own flesh and blood to rebel!

1425
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,650
Salan.

1426
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,060
Out upon it, old carrion!

1427
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,770
rebels it at
these years?

1428
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:49,770
Shy.

1429
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:53,750
I say my daughter is my flesh and ⁠
blood.

1430
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,750
Salar.

1431
01:12:54,750 --> 01:13:00,190
There is more difference between thy
flesh and hers than between jet and ivory;

1432
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:02,590
more
between your bloods than there is between

1433
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,130
red ⁠
wine and Rhenish.

1434
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,100
But tell us, do you hear
whether Antonio have had any loss at sea

1435
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,150
or no?

1436
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,150
Shy.

1437
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:18,159
There I have another bad match: a ⁠
bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show

1438
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,630
his
head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was used

1439
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,830
to
come so smug upon the mart; let him look to

1440
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:31,810
his
bond: he was wont to call me usurer; let him

1441
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:35,390
look ⁠
to his bond: he was wont to lend money for

1442
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:39,460
a
Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.

1443
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,460
Salar.

1444
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:45,909
Why, I am sure, if he forfeit thou
wilt not take his flesh: what's that good

1445
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:46,909
for?

1446
01:13:46,909 --> 01:13:47,909
⁠

1447
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:48,909
Shy.

1448
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:55,590
To bait fish withal: if it feed nothing
else, it will feed my revenge.

1449
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:01,679
He hath disgraced
me, and hindered me half a million, laughed

1450
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:07,210
at
my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my

1451
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:13,180
⁠
nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends,

1452
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,210
heated mine enemies; and what's his reason?

1453
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,250
I
am a Jew.

1454
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:24,450
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1455
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:32,370
hath not a
Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affec-

1456
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:34,530
⁠
tions, passions?

1457
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:42,580
fed with the same food, hurt
with the same weapons, subject to the same

1458
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:47,370
dis-
eases, healed by the same means, warmed and

1459
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:49,989
cooled by the same winter and summer, as a
⁠

1460
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:53,540
Christian is?

1461
01:14:53,540 --> 01:15:00,310
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh?

1462
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:05,870
if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall

1463
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,790
we
not revenge?

1464
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:13,520
If we are like you in the rest, we ⁠
will resemble you in that.

1465
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,380
If a Jew wrong a
Christian, what is his humility?

1466
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,380
Revenge.

1467
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:24,730
If a
Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance

1468
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,900
be by Christian example?

1469
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,670
Why, revenge.

1470
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:33,870
The ⁠
villainy you teach me I will execute, and

1471
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:38,199
it shall
go hard but I will better the instruction.

1472
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,449
Enter a man from Antonio.

1473
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:41,449
Man.

1474
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:46,579
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his
house, and desires to speak with you both.

1475
01:15:46,579 --> 01:15:47,579
⁠

1476
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:48,579
Salar.

1477
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:50,280
We have been up and down to seek
him.

1478
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,300
Enter Tubal.

1479
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,300
Salan.

1480
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:56,110
Here comes another of the tribe: a
third cannot be matched, unless the devil

1481
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:57,580
him- ⁠
self turn Jew.

1482
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,580
Exeunt Gentlemen [i.e.

1483
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,260
Salanio, Salarino, and Antonio's man].

1484
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,260
Shy.

1485
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,670
How now, Tubal!

1486
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,730
what news from Ge-
noa?

1487
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:05,199
Hast thou found my daughter?

1488
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,199
Tub.

1489
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:09,800
I often came where I did hear of her, ⁠
but cannot find her.

1490
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Shy.

1491
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,810
Why there, there, there, there!

1492
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,960
a diamond
gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort!

1493
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,101
The curse never fell upon our nation till
now; I ⁠

1494
01:16:22,101 --> 01:16:26,040
never felt it till now: two thousand ducats
in

1495
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,260
that; and other precious, precious jewels.

1496
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,260
I
would my daughter were dead at my foot, and

1497
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,489
the jewels in her ear! would she were hearsed
at ⁠

1498
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:39,940
my foot, and the ducats in her coffin!

1499
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,219
No news
of them?

1500
01:16:41,219 --> 01:16:47,840
Why, so: and I know not what's spent
in the search: Why thou—loss upon loss!

1501
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,560
the
thief gone with so much, and so much to find

1502
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,580
the ⁠
thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge: nor

1503
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:59,470
no ill
luck stirring but what lights on my shoulders;

1504
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:03,949
no sighs but of my breathing; no tears but
of

1505
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:05,080
my shedding.

1506
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,080
⁠

1507
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,080
Tub.

1508
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,510
Yes, other men have ill luck too.

1509
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,640
An-
tonio, as I heard in Genoa,—

1510
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,640
Shy.

1511
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,719
What, what, what?

1512
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,800
ill luck, ill luck?

1513
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
Tub.

1514
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,989
—hath an argosy cast away, coming ⁠
from Tripolis.

1515
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:21,989
Shy.

1516
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:22,989
I thank God!

1517
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:24,310
I thank God!

1518
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,360
Is it true?
is it true?

1519
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
Tub.

1520
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,050
I spoke with some of the sailors that ⁠
escaped the wrack.

1521
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,050
Shy.

1522
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,050
I thank thee, good Tubal.

1523
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,320
Good news,
good news!

1524
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,320
ha, ha!

1525
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,510
Where? in Genoa?

1526
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:36,510
Tub.

1527
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:41,199
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I ⁠
heard, one night, fourscore ducats.

1528
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,199
Shy.

1529
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:48,889
Thou stick'st a dagger in me: I shall
never see my gold again: fourscore ducats

1530
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:50,780
at a
sitting!

1531
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:52,039
fourscore ducats!

1532
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:53,039
⁠

1533
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:54,039
Tub.

1534
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:58,179
There came divers of Antonios creditors
in my company to Venice, that swear he cannot

1535
01:17:58,179 --> 01:17:59,400
choose but break.

1536
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Shy.

1537
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,790
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; ⁠
I'll torture him: I am glad of it.

1538
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,790
Tub.

1539
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:09,930
One of them showed me a ring that he
had of your daughter for a monkey.

1540
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:10,930
Shy.

1541
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:11,930
Out upon her!

1542
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:16,060
Thou torturest me, ⁠
Tubal: it was my turquoise; I had it of Leah

1543
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:21,940
when I was a bachelor: I would not have given
it for a wilderness of monkeys.

1544
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,940
Tub.

1545
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,260
But Antonio is certainly undone.

1546
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,260
⁠

1547
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,260
Shy.

1548
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,880
Nay, that's true, that's very true.

1549
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,170
Go,
Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight

1550
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,170
before.

1551
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:38,150
I will have the heart of him, if he for-
feit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make

1552
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,820
what ⁠
merchandise I will.

1553
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:44,989
Go, go, Tubal, and meet me
at our synagogue; go, good Tubal; at our syna-

1554
01:18:44,989 --> 01:18:45,989
gogue, Tubal.

1555
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:46,989
Exeunt.

1556
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:47,989
Scene Two

1557
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:48,989
[Belmont.

1558
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:49,989
A Room in Portia's House]

1559
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:52,290
Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, [Nerissa,]
and all their Train.

1560
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,290
Por.

1561
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:58,470
I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,

1562
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,770
I lose your company: therefore, forbear awhile.

1563
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:06,020
There's something tells me, but it is not
love, ⁠

1564
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:11,820
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.

1565
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:17,639
But lest you should not understand me well,—
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,—

1566
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:19,980
⁠
I would detain you here some month or two

1567
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,790
Before you venture for me.

1568
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:27,590
I could teach you
How to choose right, but then I am forsworn;

1569
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:35,460
So will I never be: so may you miss me; ⁠
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,

1570
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,560
That I had been forsworn.

1571
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:42,199
Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me:

1572
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,270
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
⁠

1573
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:53,400
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours.

1574
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:58,210
O! these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights;

1575
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,889
And so, though yours, not yours.

1576
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:05,300
Prove it so, ⁠
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

1577
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:11,520
I speak too long; but 'tis to peise the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,

1578
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,110
To stay you from election.

1579
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:18,010
Bass.⁠Let me choose; ⁠
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

1580
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,010
Por.

1581
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,350
Upon the rack, Bassanio!

1582
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:23,740
then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.

1583
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,740
Bass.

1584
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:30,199
None but that ugly treason of mistrust, ⁠
Which makes me fear th' enjoying of my love:

1585
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:37,420
There may as well be amity and life
"Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

1586
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,420
Por.

1587
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,389
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack, ⁠
Where men enforced do speak anything.

1588
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:44,389
Bass.

1589
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,639
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

1590
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:47,639
Por.

1591
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:49,750
Well then, confess, and live.

1592
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:55,930
Bass.⁠'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession: ⁠

1593
01:20:55,930 --> 01:21:02,949
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!

1594
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:05,800
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

1595
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,800
Por.

1596
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,800
Away then!

1597
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,530
I am lock'd in one of them: ⁠
If you do love me, you will find me out.

1598
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:14,699
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.

1599
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:22,200
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,

1600
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,470
⁠
Fading in music: that the comparison

1601
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,310
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the
stream

1602
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,310
And watery death-bed for him.

1603
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:32,860
He may win;
And what is music then?

1604
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:37,150
then music is ⁠
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow

1605
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:42,620
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day

1606
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,950
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's
ear, ⁠

1607
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,360
And summon him to marriage.

1608
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,679
Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more

1609
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:53,989
love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem

1610
01:21:53,989 --> 01:22:00,410
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy ⁠
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;

1611
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:06,159
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view

1612
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,510
The issue of the exploit.

1613
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,050
Go, Hercules!

1614
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:15,600
⁠
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay

1615
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,040
I view the fight than thou that mak'st the
fray.

1616
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,040
Here Music.

1617
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,440
A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
caskets to himself.

1618
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:31,360
'Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart or in the head?

1619
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,440
⁠
How begot, how nourished?

1620
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,480
⁠Reply, reply.

1621
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:39,120
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies ⁠

1622
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,550
In the cradle where it lies.

1623
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:46,980
⁠Let us all ring fancy's knell:
⁠I'll begin it,—Ding, dong, bell.

1624
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,980
All.

1625
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,980
Ding, dong, bell.

1626
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:49,980
⁠

1627
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:50,980
Bass.

1628
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:58,270
So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceiv'd with ornament.

1629
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:06,050
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt
But, being season'd with a gracious voice,

1630
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,560
⁠
Obscures the show of evil?

1631
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,130
In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow

1632
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:21,830
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

1633
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,350
⁠
There is no vice so simple but assumes

1634
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,790
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.

1635
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:33,239
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as
false

1636
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:37,139
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
⁠

1637
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:45,470
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as

1638
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:49,690
milk;
And these assume but valour's excrement

1639
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,170
To render them redoubted!

1640
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:58,930
Look on beauty, ⁠
And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight;

1641
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:06,520
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:

1642
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:14,160
So are those crisped snaky golden locks ⁠
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,

1643
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:20,540
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,

1644
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,760
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.

1645
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,130
⁠
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore

1646
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:34,870
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,

1647
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:41,520
The seeming truth which cunning times put
on ⁠

1648
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,240
To entrap the wisest.

1649
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:52,360
Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;

1650
01:24:52,360 --> 01:25:01,470
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre

1651
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:05,120
lead, ⁠
Which rather threat'nest than dost promise

1652
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:11,199
aught,
Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,

1653
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,530
And here choose I: joy be the consequence!

1654
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,530
Por.

1655
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:17,530
[Aside.]

1656
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:22,930
How all the other passions fleet to air,
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac'd despair,

1657
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:25,940
⁠
And shuddering fear, and green-ey'd jealousy.

1658
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,340
O love!

1659
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:34,570
be moderate; allay thy ecstasy;
In measure rain thy Joy; scant this excess;

1660
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:38,070
⁠
I feel too much thy blessing; make it less,

1661
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,130
For fear I surfeit!

1662
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:40,489
Bass.⁠What find I here?

1663
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:43,170
[Opening the leaden casket.]

1664
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,679
Fair Portia's counterfeit!

1665
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:52,270
What demi-god
Hath come so near creation?

1666
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,660
Move these eyes?

1667
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,810
⁠
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,

1668
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,550
Seem they in motion?

1669
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:07,350
Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar

1670
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,570
Should sunder such sweet friends.

1671
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:17,390
Here, in her hairs
The painter plays the spider, and hath woven

1672
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:22,030
⁠
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men

1673
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:33,800
Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes!—
How could he see to do them? having made one,

1674
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,159
⁠
Methinks it should have power to steal both

1675
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:43,350
his
And leave itself unfurnish'd: yet look, how

1676
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:47,119
far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this

1677
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:52,679
shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow ⁠

1678
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,050
Doth limp behind the substance.

1679
01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:02,310
Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.

1680
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:11,410
'You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!

1681
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,969
⁠
Since this fortune falls to you,

1682
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:18,520
Be content and seek no new.

1683
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,620
If you be well pleas'd with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss, ⁠

1684
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:31,219
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.'

1685
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,920
A gentle scroll.

1686
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,160
Fair lady, by your leave;

1687
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,389
[Kissing her.]

1688
01:27:38,389 --> 01:27:42,500
I come by note, to give and to receive.

1689
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,610
⁠
Like one of two contending in a prize,

1690
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:49,420
That thinks he hath done well in people's
eyes,

1691
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:57,420
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt ⁠

1692
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:06,700
Whether those peals of praise be his or no;
So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,

1693
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:14,900
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

1694
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,900
⁠

1695
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,900
Por.

1696
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:22,050
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone

1697
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:27,750
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet for you ⁠

1698
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:33,750
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times

1699
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:38,100
More rich;
That only to stand high in your account, ⁠

1700
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:45,310
I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account: but the full sum of me

1701
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:53,440
Is sum of nothing; which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractis'd;

1702
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,000
⁠
Happy in this, she is not yet so old

1703
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,220
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;

1704
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,989
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
⁠

1705
01:29:05,989 --> 01:29:13,310
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.

1706
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:18,179
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord ⁠

1707
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:25,480
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself; and even now, but now,

1708
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:29,699
This house, these servants, and this same
myself

1709
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:32,080
Are yours, my lord.

1710
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,510
I give them with this ring; ⁠
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,

1711
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:41,420
Let it presage the ruin of your love,
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

1712
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:42,420
Bass.

1713
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:50,909
Madam, you have bereft me of all words, ⁠
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;

1714
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:56,869
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As, after some oration fairly spoke

1715
01:29:56,869 --> 01:30:02,989
By a beloved prince, there doth appear ⁠
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;

1716
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:11,390
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,

1717
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:13,659
Express'd and not express'd.

1718
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:20,220
But when this ring ⁠
Parts from this finger, then parts life from

1719
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:26,210
hence:
O! then be bold to say Bassanio's dead.

1720
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:27,210
Ner.

1721
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:34,070
My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,

1722
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,550
⁠
To cry, good joy.

1723
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:38,840
Good joy, my lord and lady!

1724
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:39,840
Gra.

1725
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,810
My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;

1726
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:49,429
For I am sure you can wish none from me: ⁠
And when your honours mean to solemnize

1727
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:54,989
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Even at that time I may be married too.

1728
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:55,989
Bass.

1729
01:30:55,989 --> 01:30:59,210
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

1730
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,210
Gra.

1731
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,250
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.

1732
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,060
⁠
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:

1733
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:11,960
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
You lov'd, I lov'd; for intermission ⁠

1734
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,239
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.

1735
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:20,020
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;

1736
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:25,119
For wooing here until I sweat again, ⁠
And swearing till my very roof was dry

1737
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:31,060
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here

1738
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:34,000
To have her love, provided that your fortune
⁠

1739
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,340
Achiev'd her mistress.

1740
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,140
Por.⁠Is this true, Nerissa?

1741
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,140
Ner.

1742
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,380
Madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.

1743
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,380
Bass.

1744
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,400
And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

1745
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
Gra.

1746
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,110
Yes, faith, my lord.

1747
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,110
⁠

1748
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:50,110
Bass.

1749
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:51,820
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

1750
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,820
Gra.

1751
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,050
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand
ducats.

1752
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:56,050
Ner.

1753
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,159
What! and stake down?

1754
01:31:57,159 --> 01:31:58,159
⁠

1755
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,159
Gra.

1756
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,889
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and
stake down.

1757
01:32:01,889 --> 01:32:03,690
But who comes here?

1758
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:08,119
Lorenzo and his infidel?

1759
01:32:08,119 --> 01:32:10,830
What! and my old Venetian friend, Salanio?

1760
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:11,830
⁠

1761
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:12,830
Enter Lorenzo, Jessica, and Salanio.

1762
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:13,830
Bass.

1763
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:18,820
Lorenzo, and Salanio, welcome hither,
If that the youth of my new interest here

1764
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,900
Have power to bid you welcome.

1765
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,690
By your leave,
I bid my very friends and countrymen, ⁠

1766
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:27,739
Sweet Portia, welcome.

1767
01:32:27,739 --> 01:32:31,719
Por.⁠So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.

1768
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:32,719
Lor.

1769
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:33,790
I thank your honour.

1770
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:38,739
For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;

1771
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:41,179
⁠
But meeting with Salanio by the way,

1772
01:32:41,179 --> 01:32:45,440
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.

1773
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,520
Salan.⁠I did, my lord,
And I have reason for it.

1774
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,570
Signior Antonio ⁠
Commends him to you.

1775
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:52,570
[Gives Bassanio a letter.]

1776
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:56,210
Bass.⁠Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

1777
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,210
Salan.

1778
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:02,409
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there

1779
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,409
⁠
Will show you his estate.

1780
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,179
[Bassanio] Opens the Letter.

1781
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:06,179
Gra.

1782
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:09,690
Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.

1783
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:11,389
Your hand, Salanio.

1784
01:33:11,389 --> 01:33:12,750
What's the news from Venice?

1785
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:16,360
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?

1786
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,570
⁠
I know he will be glad of our success;

1787
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:21,540
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

1788
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,540
Salan.

1789
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,870
I would you had won the fleece that he hath
lost.

1790
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:25,870
Por.

1791
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,840
There are some shrewd contents in yon same
paper, ⁠

1792
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:34,190
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the

1793
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:36,300
world
Could turn so much the constitution

1794
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,949
Of any constant man.

1795
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:40,989
What, worse and worse!

1796
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:43,060
⁠
With leave, Bassanio; I am half yourself,

1797
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:47,660
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.

1798
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:50,980
Bass.⁠O sweet Portia!

1799
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,540
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
⁠

1800
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,540
That ever blotted paper.

1801
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:01,500
Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,

1802
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:09,020
I freely told you all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman: ⁠

1803
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:15,830
And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see

1804
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:19,000
How much I was a braggart.

1805
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,790
When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told

1806
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:26,469
you ⁠
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,

1807
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:34,020
I have engag'd myself to a dear friend,
Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy,

1808
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,790
To feed my means.

1809
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:41,500
Here is a letter, lady; ⁠
The paper as the body of my friend,

1810
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,239
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood.

1811
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,460
But is it true, Salanio?

1812
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,910
Hath all his ventures fail'd?

1813
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:56,100
What, not one hit?

1814
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,489
⁠
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,

1815
01:34:59,489 --> 01:35:02,400
From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?

1816
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,360
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?

1817
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,950
Salan.⁠Not one, my lord.

1818
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:13,850
⁠
Besides, it should appear, that if he had

1819
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:18,480
The present money to discharge the Jew,
He would not take it.

1820
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,429
Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,

1821
01:35:22,429 --> 01:35:25,889
⁠
So keen and greedy to confound a man.

1822
01:35:25,889 --> 01:35:30,740
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,

1823
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:34,389
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
⁠

1824
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:39,970
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with

1825
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,949
him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea

1826
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:46,769
Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

1827
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:47,769
⁠

1828
01:35:47,769 --> 01:35:48,769
Jes.

1829
01:35:48,769 --> 01:35:52,870
When I was with him, I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,

1830
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:58,560
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum ⁠

1831
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:04,740
That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,
If law, authority, and power deny not,

1832
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:06,360
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

1833
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:07,360
Por.

1834
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,600
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

1835
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,600
Bass.

1836
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,080
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
⁠

1837
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:21,040
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom

1838
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:26,320
The ancient Roman honour more appears ⁠
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

1839
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,320
Por.

1840
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,659
What sum owes he the Jew?

1841
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:29,659
Bass.

1842
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,710
For me, three thousand ducats.

1843
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:33,590
Por.⁠What, no more?

1844
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:37,270
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
⁠

1845
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:40,930
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description

1846
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,160
Shall lose a hair thorough Bassanio's fault.

1847
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,620
First go with me to church and call me wife,
⁠

1848
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:50,150
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side

1849
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:51,889
With an unquiet soul.

1850
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:55,320
You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over: ⁠

1851
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,230
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.

1852
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:02,619
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime,
Will live as maids and widows.

1853
01:37:02,619 --> 01:37:03,619
Come, away!

1854
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:05,440
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day.

1855
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,030
⁠
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;

1856
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:12,130
Since you are dear bought, I will love you
dear.

1857
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:14,750
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

1858
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:15,750
Bass.

1859
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:21,110
"Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all mis- ⁠
carried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate

1860
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:26,820
is very
low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since,

1861
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:30,800
in
paying it, it is impossible I should live,

1862
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,920
all debts
are cleared between you and I, if I might

1863
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,740
but see ⁠
you at my death.

1864
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:42,639
Notwithstanding, use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you

1865
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,949
to come,
let not my letter.'

1866
01:37:44,949 --> 01:37:45,949
Por.

1867
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:48,730
O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

1868
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,730
⁠

1869
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:50,730
Bass.

1870
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:54,920
Since I have your good leave to go away,
⁠I will make haste; but, till I come again,

1871
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:00,760
⁠No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
⁠Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

1872
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,760
Exeunt.

[Venice.

A Street]

1876
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:07,119
Enter the Jew, and Salarino, and Antonio,
and the Gaoler.

1877
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,119
Shy.

1878
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:15,070
Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:

1879
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,120
Gaoler, look to him.

1880
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,120
Ant.

1881
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,639
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

1882
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:20,639
Shy.

1883
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:26,880
Ill have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

1884
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,630
⁠
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,

1885
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:35,540
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice.

1886
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:39,159
I do wonder, ⁠
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond

1887
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:41,530
To come abroad with him at his request.

1888
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:42,530
Ant.

1889
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,969
I pray thee, hear me speak.

1890
01:38:43,969 --> 01:38:44,969
Shy.

1891
01:38:44,969 --> 01:38:52,790
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond, and therefore speak no

1892
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:53,790
more.

1893
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:56,330
⁠
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,

1894
01:38:56,330 --> 01:39:02,980
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
To Christian intercessors.

1895
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:10,890
Follow not; ⁠
I'll have no speaking; I will have my bond.

1896
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:11,890
Exit Jew.

1897
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:12,890
Salar.

1898
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,570
It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.

1899
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:20,110
Ant.⁠Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.

1900
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:23,429
⁠
He seeks my life; his reason well I know.

1901
01:39:23,429 --> 01:39:28,070
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;

1902
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:29,630
Therefore he hates me.

1903
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,630
Salar.

1904
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,550
I am sure the duke ⁠
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

1905
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,550
Ant.

1906
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:38,300
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have

1907
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:44,050
With us in Venice, if it be denied, ⁠
'Twill much impeach the justice of the state;

1908
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:48,719
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations.

1909
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:53,510
Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,

1910
01:39:53,510 --> 01:39:56,099
⁠
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh

1911
01:39:56,099 --> 01:39:58,120
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.

1912
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,340
Well, gaoler, on.

1913
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:04,770
Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

1914
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,770
⁠

1915
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:06,770
Exeunt.

1916
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:07,770
Scene Four

1917
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:08,770
[Belmont.

1918
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,770
A Room in Portia's House]

1919
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:12,599
Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica, and
a man of Portia's [Balthazar].

1920
01:40:12,599 --> 01:40:13,599
Lor.

1921
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:19,949
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit

1922
01:40:19,949 --> 01:40:28,150
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.

1923
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:32,200
⁠
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,

1924
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:39,280
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,

1925
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:46,420
I know you would be prouder of the work ⁠
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

1926
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:47,420
Por.

1927
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:50,880
I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions

1928
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,880
That do converse and waste the time together,
⁠

1929
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,540
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
There must be needs a like proportion

1930
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:03,909
Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;
Which makes me think that this Antonio, ⁠

1931
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:07,920
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord.

1932
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:11,230
If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd

1933
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,800
In purchasing the semblance of my soul ⁠
From out the state of hellish cruelty!

1934
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:21,820
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore, no more of it: hear other things.

1935
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,820
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands ⁠
The husbandry and manage of my house

1936
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:32,460
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow

1937
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:36,750
To live in prayer and contemplation, ⁠
Only attended by Nerissa here,

1938
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,130
Until her husband and my lord's return.

1939
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:43,630
There is a monastery two miles off,
And there will we abide.

1940
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:45,969
I do desire you ⁠
Not to deny this imposition,

1941
01:41:45,969 --> 01:41:50,800
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.

1942
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,809

I shall obey you in all fair commands.

1945
01:41:58,809 --> 01:42:02,420
My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica

1946
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:04,430
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.

1947
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:07,429
So fare you well till we shall meet again.

1948
01:42:07,429 --> 01:42:08,429

Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

1952
01:42:11,849 --> 01:42:13,730
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

1953
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:14,730
Por.

1954
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:20,020
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
To wish it back on you: fare you well, Jessica.

Exeunt [Jessica and Lorenzo].

1957
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,800
Now, Balthazar,
As I have ever found thee honest-true,

1958
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,000
So let me find thee still.

1959
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,880
Take this same letter,
And use thou all the endeavour of a man ⁠

1960
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:36,760
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;

1961
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,010
And, look, what notes and garments he doth
give thee,

1962
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:42,830
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed
⁠

1963
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:46,199
Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice.

1964
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:50,340
Waste no time in words,
But get thee gone: I shall be there before

1965
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,340
thee.

1966
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,340

1967
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,340

Come on, Nerissa: I have work in hand
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands

1972
01:42:58,409 --> 01:42:59,409
Before they think of us.

1973
01:42:59,409 --> 01:43:01,239

1974
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:02,239
Por.

1975
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:06,219
They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit ⁠
That they shall think we are accomplished

1976
01:43:06,219 --> 01:43:07,469
With that we lack.

1977
01:43:07,469 --> 01:43:11,969
I'll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutred like young men,

1978
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:14,400
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
⁠

1979
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,360
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy

1980
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:24,119
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays ⁠

1981
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:27,989
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint
lies,

1982
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:32,761
How honourable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died:

1983
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:38,179
I could not do withal; then I'll repent, ⁠
And wish, for all that, that I had not kill'd

1984
01:43:38,179 --> 01:43:42,480
them:
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,

1985
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,580
That men shall swear I have discontinu'd school
Above a twelvemonth.

1986
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:51,310
I have within my mind ⁠
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,

1987
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,710
Which I will practise.

1988
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:55,400
Ner.⁠Why, shall we turn to men?

1989
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400

1990
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,739
Fie, what a question's that,
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!

1991
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:02,369
⁠
But come: I'll tell thee all my whole device

1992
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:07,310
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,

1993
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:08,979
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.

the father are to be laid upon the children;

there-
fore, I promise you, I fear you.

2003
01:44:21,502 --> 01:44:25,120
I was always
plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation

2004

⁠
of the matter: therefore be of good cheer;

for,
truly, I think you are damned.

There is but one
hope in it that can do you any good, and that

2007
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:36,440
is
but a kind of bastard hope neither.

father got you not, that you are not the Jew's

01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:57,260
Truly then I fear you are damned both ⁠
by father and mother: thus when I shun Scylla,

2020
01:44:57,260 --> 01:45:02,400
your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother:
well, you are gone both ways.

2021
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,400
Jes.

2022
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,929
I shall be saved by my husband; he hath ⁠
made me a Christian.

2023
01:45:05,929 --> 01:45:06,929
Laun.

2024
01:45:06,929 --> 01:45:12,050
Truly the more to blame he: we were
Christians enow before; e'en as many as could

2025
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,540
well live one by another.

2026
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:18,050
This making of Chris- ⁠
tians will raise the price of hogs: if we

2027
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:21,190
grow all
to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have

2028
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:24,690
a
rasher on the coals for money.

2029
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:25,770
Jes.

2030
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:27,460
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you
⁠

2031
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,460
say: here he comes.

2032
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:29,460
Enter Lorenzo.

2033
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:30,460
Lor.

2034
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:35,449
I shall grow jealous of you shortly,
Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into cor-

2035
01:45:35,449 --> 01:45:36,449
ners.

2036
01:45:36,449 --> 01:45:37,449
⁠

2037
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:38,449
Jes.

2038
01:45:38,449 --> 01:45:39,880
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo:
Launcelot and I are out.

2039
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:43,159
He tells me flatly,
there is no mercy for me in heaven, because

2040
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:46,019
I
am a Jew's daughter: and he says you are no

2041
01:45:46,019 --> 01:45:48,910
⁠
good member of the commonwealth, for, in con-

2042
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:51,300
verting Jews to Christians, you raise the
price of

2043
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,300
pork.

2044
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:53,300
Lor.

2045
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:58,550
I shall answer that better to the com- ⁠
monwealth than you can the getting up of the

2046
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:04,409
negro's belly: the Moor is with child by you,
Launcelot.

2047
01:46:04,409 --> 01:46:05,409
Laun.

2048
01:46:05,409 --> 01:46:08,699
It is much that the Moor should be ⁠
more than reason; but if she be less than

2049
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:12,030
an
honest woman, she is indeed more than I took

2050
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:13,030
her for.

2051
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:14,030
Lor.

2052
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:17,100
How every fool can play upon the word!

2053
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:20,810
⁠
I think the best grace of wit will shortly

2054
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:25,599
turn
into silence, and discourse grow commendable

2055
01:46:25,599 --> 01:46:28,080
in none only but parrots.

2056
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,239
Go in, sirrah: bid
them prepare for dinner.

2057
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:33,239
⁠

2058
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:34,239
Laun.

2059
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,400
That is done, sir; they have all
stomachs.

2060
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,400
Lor.

2061
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:43,599
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are
you! then bid them prepare dinner.

2062
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:44,599
⁠

2063
01:46:44,599 --> 01:46:45,599
Laun.

2064
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:48,489
That is done too, sir; only, 'cover' is
the word.

2065
01:46:48,489 --> 01:46:49,489
Lor.

2066
01:46:49,489 --> 01:46:52,880
Will you cover, then, sir?

2067
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:53,969
Laun.

2068
01:46:53,969 --> 01:46:57,159
Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.

2069
01:46:57,159 --> 01:46:58,159
⁠

2070
01:46:58,159 --> 01:46:59,159
Lor.

2071
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:00,450
Yet more quarrelling with occasion!

2072
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:04,639
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit
in

2073
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:06,630
an instant?

2074
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:15,561
I pray thee, understand a plain man
in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows; bid

2075
01:47:15,561 --> 01:47:20,360
⁠
them cover the table, serve in the meat, and

2076
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:22,900
we
will come in to dinner.

2077
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,900
Laun.

2078
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:28,659
For the table, sir, it shall be served in;
for the meat, sir, it shall be covered; for

2079
01:47:28,659 --> 01:47:32,130
your ⁠
coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as

2080
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,050
hu-
mours and conceits shall govern.

2081
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:36,050
Exit Clown.

2082
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,050
Lor.

2083
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:42,099
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!

2084
01:47:42,099 --> 01:47:49,590
The fool hath planted in his memory ⁠
An army of good words: and I do know

2085
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:56,760
A many fools, that stand in better place,
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word

2086
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,650
Defy the matter.

2087
01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:02,110
How cheer'st thou, Jessica?

2088
01:48:02,110 --> 01:48:07,400
⁠
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion;

2089
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:10,550
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?

2090
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:11,550
Jes.

2091
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:12,550
Past all expressing.

2092
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:16,590
It is very meet,
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, ⁠

2093
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:22,060
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;

2094
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:27,740
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
In reason he should never come to heaven.

2095
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:30,929
⁠
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly

2096
01:48:30,929 --> 01:48:33,230
match,
And on the wager lay two earthly women,

2097
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:39,909
And Portia one, there must be something else
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world

2098
01:48:39,909 --> 01:48:42,730
⁠
Hath not her fellow.

2099
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:49,679
Lor.⁠Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

2100
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:50,679
Jes.

2101
01:48:50,679 --> 01:48:52,300
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

2102
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,300
Lor.

2103
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:56,389
I will anon; first, let us go to dinner.

2104
01:48:56,389 --> 01:48:57,389
⁠

2105
01:48:57,389 --> 01:48:58,389
Jes.

2106
01:48:58,389 --> 01:48:59,389
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

2107
01:48:59,389 --> 01:49:00,389
Lor.

2108
01:49:00,389 --> 01:49:08,750
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
Then howsoe'er thou speak'st, 'mong other

2109
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:13,290
things
I shall digest it.

2110
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:15,670
Jes.

2111
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:27,570
Well, I'll set you forth.

2112
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,949
Exeunt.

2113
01:49:29,949 --> 01:49:32,330
Duke.

2114
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:42,200
What, is Antonio here?

2115
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,900
Ant.

2116
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:59,179
Ready, so please your Grace.

2117
01:49:59,179 --> 01:50:01,230
Duke.

2118
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:07,080
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch ⁠

2119
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:11,880
Uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.

2120
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:17,040
Ant.⁠I have heard
Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify

2121
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:20,980
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,
⁠

2122
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:25,889
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose

2123
01:50:25,889 --> 01:50:31,480
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer with a quietness of spirit ⁠

2124
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,050
The very tyranny and rage of his.

2125
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:35,050
Duke.

2126
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,190
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

2127
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:38,190
Salar.

2128
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:41,180
He's ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

2129
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,000
Enter Shylock.

2130
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Duke.

2131
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,829
Make room, and let him stand before our face.

2132
01:50:46,829 --> 01:50:50,400
⁠
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so

2133
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,420
too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy

2134
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:56,810
malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought

2135
01:50:56,810 --> 01:51:00,329
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
⁠

2136
01:51:00,329 --> 01:51:06,540
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,—

2137
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:11,830
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,—
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, ⁠

2138
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:17,040
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;

2139
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:22,590
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,

2140
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:25,000
⁠
Enow to press a royal merchant down,

2141
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,910
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,

2142
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,869
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
⁠

2143
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:36,810
To offices of tender courtesy.

2144
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,780
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

2145
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:40,780
Shy.

2146
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:46,700
I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn ⁠

2147
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:52,730
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light

2148
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:55,490
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.

2149
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:58,840
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have
⁠

2150
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:06,579
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:

2151
01:52:06,579 --> 01:52:10,610
But say it is my humour: is it answer'd?

2152
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:16,179
What if my house be troubled with a rat, ⁠
And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats

2153
01:52:16,179 --> 01:52:17,920
To have it ban'd?

2154
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,869
What, are you answer'd yet?

2155
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:27,090
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; ⁠

2156
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:30,480
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the
nose,

2157
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:36,270
Cannot contain their urine: for affection
Masters our passion, sways it to the mood

2158
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:38,830
Of what it likes, or loathes.

2159
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:44,560
Now, for your answer: ⁠
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,

2160
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:51,679
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;

2161
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:57,820
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force ⁠
Must yield to such inevitable shame

2162
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:04,619
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,

2163
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:07,179
More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing
⁠

2164
01:53:07,179 --> 01:53:11,930
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him.

2165
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:14,140
Are you answer'd?

2166
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,140
Bass.

2167
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:20,619
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

2168
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:21,619
⁠

2169
01:53:21,619 --> 01:53:22,619
Shy.

2170
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:24,929
I am not bound to please thee with my answer.

2171
01:53:24,929 --> 01:53:25,929
Bass.

2172
01:53:25,929 --> 01:53:29,090
Do all men kill the things they do not love?

2173
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:30,119
Shy.

2174
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:33,159
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

2175
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:34,159
Bass.

2176
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:36,869
Every offence is not a hate at first.

2177
01:53:36,869 --> 01:53:37,869
⁠

2178
01:53:37,869 --> 01:53:38,869
Shy.

2179
01:53:38,869 --> 01:53:39,869
What!

2180
01:53:39,869 --> 01:53:40,869
wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

2181
01:53:40,869 --> 01:53:41,869
Ant.

2182
01:53:41,869 --> 01:53:46,350
I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach,

2183
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:48,790
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
⁠

2184
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:55,060
You may as well use question with the wolf,
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;

2185
01:53:55,060 --> 01:54:00,099
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise

2186
01:54:00,099 --> 01:54:03,579
⁠
When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;

2187
01:54:03,579 --> 01:54:08,100
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that—than which what's

2188
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,100
harder?—
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech

2189
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:16,099
you, ⁠
Make no more offers, use no further means;

2190
01:54:16,099 --> 01:54:21,780
But with all brief and plain conveniency,
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.

2191
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,780
Bass.

2192
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,940
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

2193
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:26,940
⁠

2194
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:27,940
Shy.

2195
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:34,500
If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,

2196
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,400
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

2197
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,400
Duke.

2198
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,519
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

2199
01:54:41,519 --> 01:54:42,519
⁠

2200
01:54:42,519 --> 01:54:43,519
Shy.

2201
01:54:43,519 --> 01:54:45,770
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

2202
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:53,829
You have among you many a purchas'd slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

2203
01:54:53,829 --> 01:55:03,290
You use in abject and in slavish parts, ⁠
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,

2204
01:55:03,290 --> 01:55:08,909
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?

2205
01:55:08,909 --> 01:55:11,699
Why sweat they under burdens?

2206
01:55:11,699 --> 01:55:15,900
let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates

2207
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:18,580
⁠
Be season'd with such viands?

2208
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:25,159
You will answer:
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:

2209
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:32,829
The pound of flesh which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have

2210
01:55:32,829 --> 01:55:33,989
it.

2211
01:55:33,989 --> 01:55:37,159
⁠
If you deny me, fie upon your law!

2212
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:39,810
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

2213
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:43,290
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have
it?

2214
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,290
Duke.

2215
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:49,030
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, ⁠
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,

2216
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:53,010
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.

2217
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:57,850
Salar.⁠My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,

2218
01:55:57,850 --> 01:55:59,389
⁠
New come from Padua.

2219
01:55:59,389 --> 01:56:00,389
Duke.

2220
01:56:00,389 --> 01:56:02,760
Bring us the letters: call the messenger.

2221
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,760
Bass.

2222
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,369
Good cheer, Antonio!

2223
01:56:05,369 --> 01:56:07,870
What, man, courage yet!

2224
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:12,000
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones,
and all, ⁠

2225
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,239
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

2226
01:56:15,239 --> 01:56:16,239
Ant.

2227
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:20,929
I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit

2228
01:56:20,929 --> 01:56:23,829
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me:
⁠

2229
01:56:23,829 --> 01:56:28,810
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.

2230
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:33,050
Enter Nerissa [dressed like a lawyer's clerk].

2231
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,050
Duke.

2232
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:36,150
Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

2233
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,150
Ner.

2234
01:56:37,150 --> 01:56:38,270
From both, my lord.

2235
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,139
Bellario greets your Grace.

2236
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:41,139
⁠

2237
01:56:41,139 --> 01:56:42,139
[Presents a letter.]

2238
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:43,139
Bass.

2239
01:56:43,139 --> 01:56:44,349
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

2240
01:56:44,349 --> 01:56:45,349
Shy.

2241
01:56:45,349 --> 01:56:48,430
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

2242
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:49,430
Gra.

2243
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:55,560
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,

2244
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,560
⁠
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness

2245
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,750
Of thy sharp envy.

2246
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,329
Can no prayers pierce thee?

2247
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:03,329
Shy.

2248
01:57:03,329 --> 01:57:05,870
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

2249
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:06,870
Gra.

2250
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:09,240
O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!

2251
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,739
⁠
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.

2252
01:57:11,739 --> 01:57:16,540
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,

2253
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:21,909
That souls of animals infuse themselves ⁠
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit

2254
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:28,160
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,

2255
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:30,829
And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
⁠

2256
01:57:30,829 --> 01:57:35,660
Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolfish, bloody, starv'd, and ravenous.

2257
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,660
Shy.

2258
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,949
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my
bond,

2259
01:57:39,949 --> 01:57:42,980
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
⁠

2260
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:47,579
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin.

2261
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:49,599
I stand here for law.

2262
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:50,599
Duke.

2263
01:57:50,599 --> 01:57:55,989
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.

2264
01:57:55,989 --> 01:57:57,099
⁠
Where is he?

2265
01:57:57,099 --> 01:58:01,570
Ner.⁠He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit

2266
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:02,570
him.

2267
01:58:02,570 --> 01:58:03,570
Duke.

2268
01:58:03,570 --> 01:58:09,210
With all my heart: some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.

2269
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:11,850
⁠
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's

2270
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,850
letter.

2271
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:13,850
[Clerk].

2272
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:18,580
'Your Grace shall understand that at the
receipt of your letter I am very sick; but

2273
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:21,900
in the
instant that your messenger came, in loving

2274
01:58:21,900 --> 01:58:25,350
visi- ⁠
tation was with me a young doctor of Rome;

2275
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,840
his
name is Balthazar.

2276
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:31,980
I acquainted him with the
cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio

2277
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,179
the merchant: we turned o'er many books toge-
⁠

2278
01:58:35,179 --> 01:58:40,250
ther: he is furnished with my opinion; which,
bettered with his own learning,—the greatness

2279
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:46,449
whereof I cannot enough commend,—comes with
him, at my importunity, to fill up your Grace's

2280
01:58:46,449 --> 01:58:48,699
⁠
request in my stead.

2281
01:58:48,699 --> 01:58:53,579
I beseech you, let his lack
of years be no impediment to let him lack

2282
01:58:53,579 --> 01:58:56,639
a re-
verend estimation, for I never knew so young

2283
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:58,940
a
body with so old a head.

2284
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:02,830
I leave him to your ⁠
gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better

2285
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,179
pub-
lish his commendation.'

2286
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:08,949
Duke.

2287
01:59:08,949 --> 01:59:13,820
You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

2288
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:14,820
⁠

2289
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,820
Enter Portia for Balthazar [dressed like a
doctor of laws].

2290
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:16,820
Give me your hand.

2291
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:18,239
Came you from old Bellario?

2292
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,239
Por.

2293
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:20,250
I did, my lord.

2294
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,250
Duke.

2295
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:23,119
You are welcome: take your place.

2296
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:27,579
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

2297
01:59:27,579 --> 01:59:28,579
⁠

2298
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:29,579
Por.

2299
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:30,579
I am informed throughly of the cause.

2300
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:33,159
Which is the merchant here, and which the
Jew?

2301
01:59:33,159 --> 01:59:34,159
Duke.

2302
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,240
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

2303
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,240
Por.

2304
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,240
Is your name Shylock?

2305
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,240
Shy.

2306
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,909
Shylock is my name.

2307
01:59:40,909 --> 01:59:41,909
⁠

2308
01:59:41,909 --> 01:59:42,909
Por.

2309
01:59:42,909 --> 01:59:48,079
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law

2310
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:50,630
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.

2311
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:52,110
[To Antonio.]

2312
01:59:52,110 --> 01:59:53,110
You stand within his danger, do you not?

2313
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,110
⁠

2314
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:55,110
Ant.

2315
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:56,110
Ay, so he says.

2316
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:57,110
Por.

2317
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:58,110
Do you confess the bond?

2318
01:59:58,110 --> 01:59:59,110
Ant.

2319
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:00,110
I do.

2320
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:01,110
Por.

2321
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:02,110
Then must the Jew be merciful.

2322
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:03,110
Shy.

2323
02:00:03,110 --> 02:00:06,130
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

2324
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:07,130
Por.

2325
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:12,120
The quality of mercy is not strain'd, ⁠
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

2326
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:19,590
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:

2327
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:21,869
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
⁠

2328
02:00:21,869 --> 02:00:27,219
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

2329
02:00:27,219 --> 02:00:33,769
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

2330
02:00:33,769 --> 02:00:35,360
⁠
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,

2331
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:40,950
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself,

2332
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:42,770
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
⁠

2333
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,730
When mercy seasons justice.

2334
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:50,060
Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,

2335
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:57,190
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,

2336
02:00:57,190 --> 02:00:58,670
⁠
And that same prayer doth teach us all to

2337
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:00,739
render
The deeds of mercy.

2338
02:01:00,739 --> 02:01:04,060
I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea,

2339
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:07,570
Which if thou follow, this strict court of
Venice ⁠

2340
02:01:07,570 --> 02:01:10,210
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant
there.

2341
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:11,210
Shy.

2342
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:12,840
My deeds upon my head!

2343
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:17,380
I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

2344
02:01:17,380 --> 02:01:18,380
Por.

2345
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,790
Is he not able to discharge the money?

2346
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:21,790
⁠

2347
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:22,790
Bass.

2348
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:28,540
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,

2349
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:35,390
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.

2350
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:38,510
⁠
If this will not suffice, it must appear

2351
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:41,310
That malice bears down truth.

2352
02:01:41,310 --> 02:01:46,110
And, I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:

2353
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:53,199
To do a great right, do a little wrong, ⁠
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

2354
02:01:53,199 --> 02:01:54,199
Por.

2355
02:01:54,199 --> 02:01:55,460
It must not be.

2356
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:58,120
There is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:

2357
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:03,340
'Twill be recorded for a precedent, ⁠
And many an error by the same example

2358
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:05,010
Will rush into the state.

2359
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:06,420
It cannot be.

2360
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,420
Shy.

2361
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:09,010
A Daniel come to judgment!

2362
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:10,170
yea, a Daniel!

2363
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:13,230
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

2364
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:14,230
⁠

2365
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:15,230
Por.

2366
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:16,230
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

2367
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:17,230
Shy.

2368
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:19,340
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor; here it is.

2369
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:20,340
Por.

2370
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,860
Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd
thee.

2371
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,860
Shy.

2372
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:27,800
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
⁠

2373
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,080
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

2374
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,449
No, not for Venice.

2375
02:02:32,449 --> 02:02:36,829
Por.⁠Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim

2376
02:02:36,829 --> 02:02:41,409
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off ⁠
Nearest the merchant's heart.

2377
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:45,469
Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

2378
02:02:45,469 --> 02:02:46,469
Shy.

2379
02:02:46,469 --> 02:02:48,460
When it is paid according to the tenour.

2380
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:53,770
It doth appear you are a worthy judge; ⁠
You know the law, your exposition

2381
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:57,540
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the
law,

2382
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:02,900
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear ⁠

2383
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:06,190
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me.

2384
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:08,469
I stay here on my bond.

2385
02:03:08,469 --> 02:03:09,469
Ant.

2386
02:03:09,469 --> 02:03:12,420
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.

2387
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:17,590
Por.⁠Why then, thus it is: ⁠
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

2388
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:18,590
Shy.

2389
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,590
O noble judge!

2390
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:21,349
O excellent young man!

2391
02:03:21,349 --> 02:03:22,349
Por.

2392
02:03:22,349 --> 02:03:26,190
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty, ⁠

2393
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:28,250
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

2394
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:29,250
Shy.

2395
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,250
'Tis very true!

2396
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:32,290
O wise and upright judge!

2397
02:03:32,290 --> 02:03:35,180
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

2398
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:36,180
Por.

2399
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:37,560
Therefore lay bare your bosom.

2400
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:42,429
Shy.⁠Ay, 'his breast:' ⁠
So says the bond:—doth it not, noble judge?—

2401
02:03:42,429 --> 02:03:47,040
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

2402
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,040
Por.

2403
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,040
It is so.

2404
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,219
Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?

2405
02:03:51,219 --> 02:03:52,219
⁠

2406
02:03:52,219 --> 02:03:53,219
Shy.

2407
02:03:53,219 --> 02:03:54,219
I have them ready.

2408
02:03:54,219 --> 02:03:55,219
Por.

2409
02:03:55,219 --> 02:04:00,210
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

2410
02:04:00,210 --> 02:04:01,210
Shy.

2411
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:02,920
Is it so nominated in the bond?

2412
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,920
⁠

2413
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:04,920
Por.

2414
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:05,920
It is not so express'd; but what of that?

2415
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:08,639
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

2416
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:09,639
Shy.

2417
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:12,989
I cannot find it: 'tis not in the bond.

2418
02:04:12,989 --> 02:04:13,989
Por.

2419
02:04:13,989 --> 02:04:16,409
You, merchant, have you anything to say?

2420
02:04:16,409 --> 02:04:17,409
⁠

2421
02:04:17,409 --> 02:04:18,409
Ant.

2422
02:04:18,409 --> 02:04:20,349
But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.

2423
02:04:20,349 --> 02:04:22,780
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!

2424
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:28,809
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind

2425
02:04:28,809 --> 02:04:32,579
⁠
Than is her custom: it is still her use

2426
02:04:32,579 --> 02:04:38,309
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow

2427
02:04:38,309 --> 02:04:41,540
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
⁠

2428
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:44,989
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.

2429
02:04:44,989 --> 02:04:49,460
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;

2430
02:04:49,460 --> 02:04:53,150
Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;
⁠

2431
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:59,429
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.

2432
02:04:59,429 --> 02:05:05,349
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;

2433
02:05:05,349 --> 02:05:08,079
⁠
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,

2434
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:11,179
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

2435
02:05:11,179 --> 02:05:12,179
Bass.

2436
02:05:12,179 --> 02:05:18,409
Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself; ⁠

2437
02:05:18,409 --> 02:05:26,290
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:

2438
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:33,429
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all,
Here to this devil, to deliver you.

2439
02:05:33,429 --> 02:05:34,429
⁠

2440
02:05:34,429 --> 02:05:35,429
Por.

2441
02:05:35,429 --> 02:05:36,429
Your wife would give you little thanks for
that,

2442
02:05:36,429 --> 02:05:37,780
If she were by to hear you make the offer.

2443
02:05:37,780 --> 02:05:38,780
Gra.

2444
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:43,350
I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could ⁠

2445
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:46,270
Entreat some power to change this currish
Jew.

2446
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,270
Ner.

2447
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:52,090
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

2448
02:05:52,090 --> 02:05:53,090
Shy.

2449
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:56,159
These be the Christian husbands!

2450
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:59,099
I have a daughter; ⁠
Would any of the stock of Barabbas

2451
02:05:59,099 --> 02:06:02,790
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!

2452
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:06,720
We trifle time; I pray thee, pursue sentence.

2453
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:07,720
Por.

2454
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:14,710
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give

2455
02:06:14,710 --> 02:06:15,710
it.

2456
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:16,710
⁠

2457
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:17,710
Shy.

2458
02:06:17,710 --> 02:06:18,710
Most rightful judge!

2459
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:19,710
Por.

2460
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:24,130
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

2461
02:06:24,130 --> 02:06:25,130
⁠

2462
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:26,130
Shy.

2463
02:06:26,130 --> 02:06:27,130
Most learned judge!

2464
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:28,130
A sentence!

2465
02:06:28,130 --> 02:06:29,130
come, prepare!

2466
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:30,130
Por.

2467
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:33,849
Tarry a little: there is something else.

2468
02:06:33,849 --> 02:06:39,240
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'

2469
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:42,891
⁠
Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of

2470
02:06:42,891 --> 02:06:46,949
flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed

2471
02:06:46,949 --> 02:06:50,460
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and
goods

2472
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:55,530
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate ⁠
Unto the state of Venice.

2473
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:56,530
Gra.

2474
02:06:56,530 --> 02:06:57,829
O upright judge!

2475
02:06:57,829 --> 02:07:00,869
Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

2476
02:07:00,869 --> 02:07:01,869
Shy.

2477
02:07:01,869 --> 02:07:03,280
Is that the law?

2478
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:08,110
Por.⁠Thyself shalt see the act;
For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd ⁠

2479
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:12,050
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir'st.

2480
02:07:12,050 --> 02:07:13,050
Gra.

2481
02:07:13,050 --> 02:07:14,170
O learned judge!

2482
02:07:14,170 --> 02:07:16,980
Mark, Jew: a learned judge!

2483
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:17,980
Shy.

2484
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:22,429
I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice,
And let the Christian go.

2485
02:07:22,429 --> 02:07:24,179
Bass.⁠Here is the money.

2486
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:25,179

2487
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:26,179
Por.

2488
02:07:26,179 --> 02:07:27,179
Soft!

2489
02:07:27,179 --> 02:07:28,830
The Jew shall have all justice; soft!

2490
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:32,210
no haste:—
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

2491
02:07:32,210 --> 02:07:33,210
Gra.

2492
02:07:33,210 --> 02:07:34,210
O Jew!

2493
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:36,349
an upright judge, a learned judge!

2494
02:07:36,349 --> 02:07:37,349

Por.

2496
02:07:38,349 --> 02:07:39,880
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.

2497
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:43,309
Shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor
more,

2498
02:07:43,309 --> 02:07:46,170
But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st
more,

2499
02:07:46,170 --> 02:07:49,510
Or less, than a just pound, be it but so much
⁠

2500
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:54,219
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part

2501
02:07:54,219 --> 02:07:57,309
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do
turn

2502
02:07:57,309 --> 02:08:01,890
But in the estimation of a hair, ⁠
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

2503
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:02,890
Gra.

2504
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:04,870
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!

2505
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:07,190
Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.

2506
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:08,190
Por.

2507
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:09,699
Why doth the Jew pause?

2508
02:08:09,699 --> 02:08:12,150
take thy forfeiture.

2509
02:08:12,150 --> 02:08:13,150
Shy.

2510
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:17,010
Give me my principal, and let me go.

2511
02:08:17,010 --> 02:08:18,010

2512
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:19,010
Bass.

2513
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:20,230
I have it ready for thee; here it is.

2514
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:21,230
Por.

2515
02:08:21,230 --> 02:08:26,010
He hath refus'd it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice, and his bond.

2516

A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!

2519
02:08:29,849 --> 02:08:32,750
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

2520

Shy.

2521
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:36,489
Shall I not have barely my principal?

Por.

2523
02:08:37,489 --> 02:08:40,770
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,

To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:46,720
Why, then the devil give him good of it!

2527
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,489
I'll stay no longer question.

2528
02:08:48,489 --> 02:08:52,360
Por.⁠Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.

2529
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,469
⁠
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,

2530
02:08:54,469 --> 02:08:59,110
If it be prov'd against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts

2531
02:08:59,110 --> 02:09:04,540
He seek the life of any citizen, ⁠
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive

2532
02:09:04,540 --> 02:09:07,880
Shall seize one half his goods; the other
half

2533
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:12,949
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy

2534
02:09:12,949 --> 02:09:16,449
⁠
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.

2535
02:09:16,449 --> 02:09:23,170
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears by manifest proceeding,

2536
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:27,790
That indirectly and directly too ⁠
Thou hast contriv'd against the very life

2537
02:09:27,790 --> 02:09:31,930
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehears'd.

2538
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:35,639
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

2539
02:09:35,639 --> 02:09:36,639
⁠

2540
02:09:36,639 --> 02:09:37,639
Gra.

2541
02:09:37,639 --> 02:09:42,500
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,

2542
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:47,070
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's

2543
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:48,070
charge.

2544
02:09:48,070 --> 02:09:49,070
Duke.

2545
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:51,059
That thou shalt see the difference of our
spirits, ⁠

2546
02:09:51,059 --> 02:09:54,540
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.

2547
02:09:54,540 --> 02:10:00,520
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,

2548
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:03,530
⁠
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

2549
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,530
Por.

2550
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:07,140
Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.

2551
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,140
Shy.

2552
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:14,300
Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop

2553
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:17,199
⁠
That doth sustain my house; you take my life

2554
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:20,090
When you do take the means whereby I live.

2555
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:21,090
Por.

2556
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:24,060
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

2557
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:25,060
⁠

2558
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:26,060
Gra.

2559
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:28,770
A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake!

2560
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:29,770
Ant.

2561
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:34,960
So please my lord the duke, and all the court,
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,

2562
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:40,130
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it, ⁠

2563
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:43,949
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:

2564
02:10:43,949 --> 02:10:50,000
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
He presently become a Christian; ⁠

2565
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,829
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,

2566
02:10:54,829 --> 02:10:56,772
Unto his son Lorenzo, and his daughter.

2567
02:10:56,772 --> 02:10:57,772
Duke.

2568
02:10:57,772 --> 02:11:03,320
He shall do this, or else I do recant ⁠
The pardon that I late pronounced here.

2569
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:04,320
Por.

2570
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,600
Art thou contented, Jew?

2571
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,429
what dost thou say?

2572
02:11:07,429 --> 02:11:08,429
Shy.

2573
02:11:08,429 --> 02:11:09,429
I am content.

2574
02:11:09,429 --> 02:11:10,429
Por.

2575
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:13,079
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

Shy.

2577
02:11:14,079 --> 02:11:17,670
I pray you give me leave to go from hence:
⁠

2578
02:11:17,670 --> 02:11:18,870
I am not well.

2579
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:25,230
Send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.

2580
02:11:25,230 --> 02:11:28,780
Duke.⁠Get thee gone, but do it.

2581
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:29,780
Gra.

2582
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:34,240
In christening thou shalt have two godfathers;
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten

2583
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:39,220
more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

2584
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:40,220
⁠

2585
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:41,220
Exit [Shylock].

2586
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:42,220
Duke.

2587
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:43,500
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

2588
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,500
Por.

2589
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:49,420
I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua, ⁠

2590
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:51,840
And it is meet I presently set forth.

2591
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:52,840
Duke.

2592
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:55,090
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.

2593
02:11:55,090 --> 02:12:00,780
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

2594
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:01,780
⁠

2595
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:04,030
Exit Duke [with Magnificoes] and his train.

2596
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:05,030
Bass.

2597
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:11,950
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted

2598
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:19,599
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, ⁠

2599
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,690
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

2600

Ant.

2601
02:12:24,699 --> 02:12:29,469
And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.

2602
02:12:29,469 --> 02:12:30,530
Por.

2603
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:35,430
He is well paid that is well satisfied; ⁠
And I, delivering you, am satisfied,-

2604
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:41,659
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.

2605
02:12:41,659 --> 02:12:48,199
I pray you, know me when we meet again: ⁠
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

2606
02:12:48,199 --> 02:12:49,199
Bass.

2607
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:55,520
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,

2608
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,699
Not as a fee.

2609
02:12:57,699 --> 02:13:03,440
Grant me two things, I pray you, ⁠
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

2610
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:04,440
Por.

2611
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:05,860
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.

2612
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:06,860
[To Antonio.]

2613
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:10,260
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your
sake;

2614
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:11,260
[To Bassanio.]

2615
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:14,130
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from
you.

2616
02:13:14,130 --> 02:13:18,220
⁠
Do not draw back your hand; Ill take no more;

2617
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:20,700
And you in love shall not deny me this.

2618
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:21,700
Bass.

2619
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:24,000
This ring, good sir?

2620
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
alas!

2621
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:30,730
it is a trifle;
I will not shame myself to give you this.

2622
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:31,730
⁠

2623
02:13:31,730 --> 02:13:32,730
Por.

2624
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:37,630
I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

2625
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:38,630
Bass.

2626
02:13:38,630 --> 02:13:42,310
There's more depends on this than on the value.

2627
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:45,639
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
⁠

2628
02:13:45,639 --> 02:13:52,219
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

2629
02:13:52,219 --> 02:13:53,219
Por.

2630
02:13:53,219 --> 02:13:58,349
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers:
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks

2631
02:13:58,349 --> 02:14:00,440
⁠
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

2632
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:01,440
Bass.

2633
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:07,800
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow

2634
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:12,159
That I should never sell nor give nor lose
it.

2635
02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:13,159
⁠

2636
02:14:13,159 --> 02:14:14,159
Por.

2637
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:16,050
That 'scuse serves many men to save their
gifts.

2638
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:20,150
And if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserv'd the ring,

2639
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:23,040
She would not hold out enemy for ever, ⁠
For giving it to me.

2640
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:26,440
Well, peace be with you.

2641
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:29,040
Exeunt [Portia and Nerissa].

Ant.

2643
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:35,540
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal

2644
02:14:35,540 --> 02:14:38,099
Be valu'd 'gainst your wife's commandment.

2645
02:14:38,099 --> 02:14:39,099
⁠

2646
02:14:39,099 --> 02:14:40,099
Bass.

2647
02:14:40,099 --> 02:14:45,369
Go, Gratiano; run and overtake him;
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou

2648
02:14:45,369 --> 02:14:47,980
canst,
Unto Antonio's house.

2649
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,330
Away!

2650
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:50,449
make haste.

2651
02:14:50,449 --> 02:14:52,489
Exit Gratiano.

2652
02:14:52,489 --> 02:14:58,500
Come, you and I will thither presently, ⁠
And in the morning early will we both

2653
02:14:58,500 --> 02:14:59,960
Fly toward Belmont.

2654
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:00,960
Come, Antonio.

2655
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:01,960
Exeunt.

Enter Portia and Nerissa.

2660
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:07,040
Por.

2661
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:10,239
Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this
deed,

2662
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:12,340
And let him sign it.

2663
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,679
We'll away to-night,
And be a day before our husbands home:

2664
02:15:14,679 --> 02:15:16,649
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

2665

2666

Enter Gratiano.

Gra.

2668
02:15:19,649 --> 02:15:21,909
Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en.

2669
02:15:21,909 --> 02:15:26,020
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat

2670
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:27,719
Your company at dinner.

2671
02:15:27,719 --> 02:15:32,300
Por.⁠That cannot be: ⁠
His ring I do accept most thankfully;

2672
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:38,380
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

Gra.

2674
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:40,820
That will I do.

2675

[Aside to Portia.]

2677

I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

Por.

02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:52,620
Thou mayst, I warrant.

2680
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:56,910
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;

2681
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:59,840
⁠
But we'll outface them, and outswear them

2682
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:00,840
too.

2683
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,840
Away!

The moon shines bright: in such a night as
this,

2690
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:52,080
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night

2691
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:57,139
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,
⁠

2692
02:16:57,139 --> 02:17:04,969
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.

Jes.⁠In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew,

02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:15,179
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, ⁠
And ran dismay'd away.

2695
02:17:15,179 --> 02:17:20,630
Lor.⁠In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand

2696
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:26,760
Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.

2697
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:31,450
Jes.⁠In such a night ⁠
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs

2698
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:33,580
That did renew old Æson.

2699
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:40,280
Lor.⁠In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,

2700
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:44,420
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice,
⁠

2701
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:46,420
As far as Belmont.

2702
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:51,030
Jes.⁠In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well,

2703
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:55,910
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And ne'er a true one.

2704
02:17:55,910 --> 02:18:02,139
Lor.⁠In such a night ⁠
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,

2705
02:18:02,139 --> 02:18:05,550
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

2706
02:18:05,550 --> 02:18:06,550
Jes.

2707
02:18:06,550 --> 02:18:09,210
I would out-night you, did nobody come;
But, hark!

2708
02:18:09,210 --> 02:18:12,380
I hear the footing of a man.

2709
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:13,380
⁠

2710
02:18:13,380 --> 02:18:14,380
Enter Messenger [Stephano].

2711
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:15,380
Lor.

2712
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:16,830
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

2713
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:17,830
Mes.

2714
02:18:17,830 --> 02:18:18,830
A friend.

2715
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:19,830
Lor.

2716
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:20,830
A friend!

2717
02:18:20,830 --> 02:18:21,830
what friend?

2718
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:22,830
your name, I pray you, friend.

2719
02:18:22,830 --> 02:18:23,830
Mes.

2720
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:26,269
Stephano is my name; and I bring word ⁠
My mistress will before the break of day

2721
02:18:26,269 --> 02:18:30,460
Be here at Belmont: she doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays

2722
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:31,950
For happy wedlock hours.

2723
02:18:31,950 --> 02:18:33,490
Lor.⁠Who comes with her?

2724
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:34,490
⁠

2725
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:35,490
Mes.

2726
02:18:35,490 --> 02:18:36,490
None, but a holy hermit and her maid.

2727
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:38,609
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?

2728
02:18:38,609 --> 02:18:39,609
Lor.

2729
02:18:39,609 --> 02:18:41,960
He is not, nor we have not heard from him.

2730
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:48,500
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica, ⁠
And ceremoniously let us prepare

2731
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:52,599
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

2732
02:18:52,599 --> 02:18:54,109
Enter Clown.

2733
02:18:54,109 --> 02:18:55,109
Clo.

2734
02:18:55,109 --> 02:18:56,370
Sola, sola!

2735
02:18:56,370 --> 02:19:00,130
wo ha, ho! sola, sola!

2736
02:19:00,130 --> 02:19:01,130
Lor.

2737
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:02,130
Who calls?

2738
02:19:02,130 --> 02:19:03,130
⁠

2739
02:19:03,130 --> 02:19:04,130
Clo.

2740
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:05,130
Sola!

2741
02:19:05,130 --> 02:19:07,000
did you see Master Lorenzo?

2742
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,519
Master Lorenzo!

2743
02:19:08,519 --> 02:19:10,050
sola, sola!

2744
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:11,050
Lor.

2745
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:12,439
Leave hollaing, man; here.

2746
02:19:12,439 --> 02:19:13,439
Clo.

2747
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:14,439
Sola!

2748
02:19:14,439 --> 02:19:15,439
where?

2749
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:16,439
where?

2750
02:19:16,439 --> 02:19:17,439
⁠

2751
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:18,439
Lor.

2752
02:19:18,439 --> 02:19:19,439
Here.

2753
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:20,439
Clo.

2754
02:19:20,439 --> 02:19:23,130
Tell him there's a post come from my
master, with his horn full of good news: my

2755
02:19:23,130 --> 02:19:24,399
master will be here ere morning.

2756
02:19:24,399 --> 02:19:25,399
⁠

2757
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:26,399
[Exit.]

2758
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:27,399
Lor.

2759
02:19:27,399 --> 02:19:30,080
Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their
coming.

2760
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:33,469
And yet no matter; why should we go in?

2761
02:19:33,469 --> 02:19:39,989
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;

2762
02:19:39,989 --> 02:19:42,679
⁠
And bring your music forth into the air.

2763
02:19:42,679 --> 02:19:43,679
[Exit Stephano.]

2764
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:47,460
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!

2765
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:54,910
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the

2766
02:19:54,910 --> 02:19:59,260
night ⁠
Become the touches of sweet harmony.

2767
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:09,770
Sit, Jessica: look, how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:

2768
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:14,710
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
⁠

2769
02:20:14,710 --> 02:20:23,680
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;

2770
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:30,729
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay ⁠

2771
02:20:30,729 --> 02:20:35,380
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

2772
02:20:35,380 --> 02:20:36,670
[Enter Musicians.]

2773
02:20:36,670 --> 02:20:44,080
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn:
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress'

2774
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:48,960
ear,
And draw her home with music.

2775
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:49,960
⁠

2776
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,960
Jes.

2777
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,120
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

2778
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,120
Play music.

2779
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,120
Lor.

2780
02:20:54,120 --> 02:21:03,090
The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,

2781
02:21:03,090 --> 02:21:11,800
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, ⁠
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing

2782
02:21:11,800 --> 02:21:15,980
loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;

2783
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:22,630
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears, ⁠

2784
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:30,939
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze

2785
02:21:30,939 --> 02:21:35,920
By the sweet power of music: therefore the
poet

2786
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:43,090
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones,
and floods;

2787
02:21:43,090 --> 02:21:47,710
Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of
rage, ⁠

2788
02:21:47,710 --> 02:21:51,520
But music for the time doth change his nature.

2789
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:59,920
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,

2790
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:05,600
⁠
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;

2791
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:15,420
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus:

2792
02:22:15,420 --> 02:22:18,260
Let no such man be trusted.

2793
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:21,560
Mark the music.

2794
02:22:21,560 --> 02:22:22,560
⁠

2795
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,160
Enter Portia and Nerissa [at a distance].

2796
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,160
Por.

2797
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,690
That light we see is burning in my hall.

2798
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:29,780
How far that little candle throws his beams!

2799
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:32,000
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

2800
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Ner.

2801
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,640
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

2802
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:35,640
⁠

2803
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:36,640
Por.

2804
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:40,640
So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king

2805
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:46,239
Until a king be by, and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook ⁠

2806
02:22:46,239 --> 02:22:48,280
Into the main of waters.

2807
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,280
Music!

2808
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:50,280
hark!

2809
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,280
Muisc.

2810
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:52,280
Ner.

2811
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:53,850
It is your music, madam, of the house.

2812
02:22:53,850 --> 02:22:54,850
Por.

2813
02:22:54,850 --> 02:22:59,710
Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

2814
02:22:59,710 --> 02:23:00,710
⁠

2815
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:01,710
Ner.

2816
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:02,710
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

2817
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:03,710
Por.

2818
02:23:03,710 --> 02:23:07,060
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended, and I think

2819
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:10,810
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
⁠

2820
02:23:10,810 --> 02:23:16,240
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.

2821
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:22,390
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!

2822
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:24,440
⁠
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion,

2823
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:26,770
And would not be awak'd!

2824
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:28,540
Music ceases.

2825
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:33,430
Lor.⁠That is the voice,
Or I am much deceiv'd, of Portia.

2826
02:23:33,430 --> 02:23:34,430
Por.

2827
02:23:34,430 --> 02:23:36,819
He knows me, as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
⁠

2828
02:23:36,819 --> 02:23:38,740
By the bad voice.

2829
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,390
Lor.⁠Dear lady, welcome home.

2830
02:23:40,390 --> 02:23:41,390
Por.

2831
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:46,370
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.

2832
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:47,990
Are they return'd?

2833
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:53,380
Lor.⁠Madam, they are not yet; ⁠
But there is come a messenger before,

2834
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:55,100
To signify their coming.

2835
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:58,770
Por.⁠Go in, Nerissa:
Give order to my servants that they take

2836
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:01,340
No note at all of our being absent hence;
⁠

2837
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:04,460
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.

2838
02:24:04,460 --> 02:24:06,010
A tucket sounds.

2839
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:07,010
Lor.

2840
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:13,120
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

2841
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:14,120
Por.

2842
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:18,260
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day, ⁠

2843
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:22,229
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

2844
02:24:22,229 --> 02:24:26,040
Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their
Followers.

2845
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:27,040
Bass.

2846
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:32,850
We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

2847
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,850
⁠

2848
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:34,850
Por.

2849
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:38,630
Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,

2850
02:24:38,630 --> 02:24:43,220
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all!

2851
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:45,279
You are welcome home, my lord.

2852
02:24:45,279 --> 02:24:46,279
⁠

2853
02:24:46,279 --> 02:24:47,279
Bass.

2854
02:24:47,279 --> 02:24:48,550
I thank you, madam.

2855
02:24:48,550 --> 02:24:53,399
Give welcome to my friend:
This is the man, this is Antonio,

2856
02:24:53,399 --> 02:24:56,540
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

2857
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,540
Por.

2858
02:24:57,540 --> 02:25:03,210
You should in all sense be much bound to him,
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

2859
02:25:03,210 --> 02:25:04,210
⁠

2860
02:25:04,210 --> 02:25:05,210
Ant.

2861
02:25:05,210 --> 02:25:06,210
No more than I am well acquitted of.

2862
02:25:06,210 --> 02:25:07,210
Por.

2863
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:10,850
Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words, ⁠

2864
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:13,460
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

2865
02:25:13,460 --> 02:25:14,460
Gra.

2866
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:15,460
[To Nerissa.]

2867
02:25:15,460 --> 02:25:20,479
By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:

2868
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:22,580
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
⁠

2869
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:25,189
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

2870
02:25:25,189 --> 02:25:26,189
Por.

2871
02:25:26,189 --> 02:25:27,189
A quarrel, ho, already!

2872
02:25:27,189 --> 02:25:28,189
what's the matter?

2873
02:25:28,189 --> 02:25:29,189
Gra.

2874
02:25:29,189 --> 02:25:33,890
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose poesy was ⁠

2875
02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:39,090
For all the world like cutlers' poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

2876
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:40,090
Ner.

2877
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:43,470
What talk you of the posy, or the value?

2878
02:25:43,470 --> 02:25:48,612
You swore to me, when I did give it you, ⁠
That you would wear it till your hour of death,

2879
02:25:48,612 --> 02:25:56,110
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,

2880
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:59,699
You should have been respective and have kept
it.

2881
02:25:59,699 --> 02:26:03,120
⁠
Gave it a judge's clerk!

2882
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,840
no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that

2883
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:09,840
had it.

2884
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:10,840
Gra.

2885
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:12,330
He will, an if he live to be a man.

2886
02:26:12,330 --> 02:26:13,330
Ner.

2887
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,489
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

2888
02:26:15,489 --> 02:26:16,489
⁠

2889
02:26:16,489 --> 02:26:17,489
Gra.

2890
02:26:17,489 --> 02:26:21,090
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,

2891
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:24,020
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk.

2892
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:29,240
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee: ⁠
I could not for my heart deny it him.

2893
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:30,240
Por.

2894
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:31,830
You were to blame,—I must be plain with
you,—

2895
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:34,750
To part so slightly with your wife's first
gift;

2896
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:37,760
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,
⁠

2897
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,340
And riveted so with faith unto your flesh.

2898
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:46,710
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands.

2899
02:26:46,710 --> 02:26:49,270
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave
it ⁠

2900
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:54,580
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
That the world masters.

2901
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:58,310
Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:

2902
02:26:58,310 --> 02:27:02,659
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

2903
02:27:02,659 --> 02:27:03,659
⁠

2904
02:27:03,659 --> 02:27:04,659
Bass.

2905
02:27:04,659 --> 02:27:05,659
[Aside.]

2906
02:27:05,659 --> 02:27:10,250
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
And swear I lost the ring defending it.

2907
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:11,250
Gra.

2908
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:14,710
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed

2909
02:27:14,710 --> 02:27:17,461
⁠
Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk,

2910
02:27:17,461 --> 02:27:20,550
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd
mine;

2911
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:23,330
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.

2912
02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:26,560
Por.⁠What ring gave you, my lord?

2913
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,750
⁠
Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me.

2914
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:29,750
Bass.

2915
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:36,470
If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger

2916
02:27:36,470 --> 02:27:40,130
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

2917
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:41,130
⁠

2918
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:42,130
Por.

2919
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:44,120
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

2920
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:47,780
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.

2921
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:51,880
Ner.⁠Nor I in yours,
Till I again see mine.

2922
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:57,600
Bass.⁠Sweet Portia, ⁠
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,

2923
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:05,010
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,

2924
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:12,270
And how unwillingly I left the ring, ⁠
When naught would be accepted but the ring,

2925
02:28:12,270 --> 02:28:15,290
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

2926
02:28:15,290 --> 02:28:16,340
Por.

2927
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:20,990
If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,

2928
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:23,930
⁠
Or your own honour to contain the ring,

2929
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:26,431
You would not then have parted with the ring.

2930
02:28:26,431 --> 02:28:31,930
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleas'd to have defended it ⁠

2931
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:38,470
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?

2932
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:44,189
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for 't but some woman had the ring.

2933
02:28:44,189 --> 02:28:45,189
⁠

2934
02:28:45,189 --> 02:28:46,189
Bass.

2935
02:28:46,189 --> 02:28:52,200
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it; but a civil doctor,

2936
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,630
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of
me,

2937
02:28:55,630 --> 02:29:00,280
And begg'd the ring, the which I did deny
him, ⁠

2938
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:06,490
And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away;
Even he that did uphold the very life

2939
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:09,230
Of my dear friend.

2940
02:29:09,230 --> 02:29:11,260
What should I say, sweet lady?

2941
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:19,160
I was enfore'd to send it after him; ⁠
I was beset with shame and courtesy;

2942
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:25,840
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it.

2943
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:31,449
Pardon me, good lady,
For, by these blessed candles of the night,

2944
02:29:31,449 --> 02:29:34,200
⁠
Had you been there, I think you would have

2945
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:37,930
begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

2946
02:29:37,930 --> 02:29:38,930
Por.

2947
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:41,840
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house.

2948
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,380
Since he hath got the jewel that I lov'd,
⁠

2949
02:29:44,380 --> 02:29:49,720
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;

2950
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:56,170
I'll not deny him anything I have;
No, not my body, nor my husband's bed.

2951
02:29:56,170 --> 02:29:58,920
⁠
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:

2952
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:05,890
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,

2953
02:30:05,890 --> 02:30:08,490
Now by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
⁠

2954
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:10,740
Ill have that doctor for my bedfellow.

2955
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,740
Ner.

2956
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:18,370
And I his clerk; therefore be well advis'd
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

2957
02:30:18,370 --> 02:30:19,370
Gra.

2958
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:22,620
Well, do you so: let not me take him, then;
⁠

2959
02:30:22,620 --> 02:30:25,990
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

2960
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,990
Ant.

2961
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:29,351
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

2962
02:30:29,351 --> 02:30:30,351
Por.

2963
02:30:30,351 --> 02:30:33,270
Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

2964
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:34,270
Bass.

2965
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:41,270
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong; ⁠
And in the hearing of these many friends,

2966
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:48,550
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself,—

2967
02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:50,819
Por.⁠Mark you but that!

2968
02:30:50,819 --> 02:30:56,940
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself; ⁠
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,

2969
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:59,130
And there's an oath of credit.

2970
02:30:59,130 --> 02:31:05,939
Bass.⁠Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear

2971
02:31:05,939 --> 02:31:09,510
I never more will break an oath with thee.

2972
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:10,510
⁠

2973
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:11,510
Ant.

2974
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:15,270
I once did lend my body for his wealth,
Which, but for him that had your husband's

2975
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:19,170
ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,

2976
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:23,790
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord ⁠
Will never more break faith advisedly.

2977
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:24,790
Por.

2978
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:26,060
Then you shall be his surety.

2979
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:31,050
Give him this,
And bid him keep it better than the other.

2980
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:32,050
Ant.

2981
02:31:32,050 --> 02:31:34,040
Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

2982
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,040
Bass.

2983
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:36,040
By heaven!

2984
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:38,350
it is the same I gave the doctor!

2985
02:31:38,350 --> 02:31:39,350
Por.

2986
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:45,640
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

2987
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:46,640
Ner.

2988
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:52,880
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano; ⁠
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,

2989
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,479
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

2990
02:31:55,479 --> 02:31:56,479
Gra.

2991
02:31:56,479 --> 02:32:00,980
Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough.

2992
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:01,980
⁠
What!

2993
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:04,590
are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it?

2994
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:05,590
Por.

2995
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:06,860
Speak not so grossly.

2996
02:32:06,860 --> 02:32:12,729
You are all amaz'd:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;

2997
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:18,520
It comes from Padua, from Bellario: ⁠
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,

2998
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:24,580
Nerissa, there, her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you

2999
02:32:24,580 --> 02:32:27,270
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
⁠

3000
02:32:27,270 --> 02:32:28,610
Enter'd my house.

3001
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:35,070
Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you

3002
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:37,959
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies

3003
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:40,979
⁠
Are richly come to harbour suddenly.

3004
02:32:40,979 --> 02:32:45,250
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.

3005
02:32:45,250 --> 02:32:46,710
Ant.⁠I am dumb.

3006
02:32:46,710 --> 02:32:47,710
Bass.

3007
02:32:47,710 --> 02:32:51,320
Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

3008
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:52,320
⁠

3009
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:53,320
Gra.

3010
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:54,810
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

3011
02:32:54,810 --> 02:32:55,810
Ner.

3012
02:32:55,810 --> 02:33:02,020
Ay; but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

3013
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:03,020
Bass.

3014
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:10,340
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow: ⁠
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

3015
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:11,340
Ant.

3016
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:17,850
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships

3017
02:33:17,850 --> 02:33:19,470
Are safely come to road.

3018
02:33:19,470 --> 02:33:21,020
Por.⁠How now, Lorenzo!

3019
02:33:21,020 --> 02:33:24,279
⁠
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

3020
02:33:24,279 --> 02:33:25,279
Ner.

3021
02:33:25,279 --> 02:33:28,450
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.

3022
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:35,771
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,

3023
02:33:35,771 --> 02:33:39,250
⁠
After his death, of all he dies possess'd

3024
02:33:39,250 --> 02:33:40,250
of.

3025
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:41,250
Lor.

3026
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:46,021
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

3027
02:33:46,021 --> 02:33:50,170
Por.⁠It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied ⁠

3028
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:51,820
Of these events at full.

3029
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:56,120
Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,

3030
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:58,110
And we will answer all things faithfully.

3031
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:59,110
Gra.

3032
02:33:59,110 --> 02:34:03,840
Let it be so: the first inter'gatory ⁠
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,

3033
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,220
Whether till the next night she had rather
stay,

3034
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:12,150
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,

3035
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:15,570
⁠
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

3036
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:27,720
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

3037
02:34:27,720 --> 02:34:31,060
Exeunt.
