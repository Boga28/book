CHAPTER ONE
Monkey's Story

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,190
Monkey pulled out some hairs from his chest
and, crying 'Change!'

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,320
threw them into the air.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,620
At once, they became several hundred small
monkeys.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,920
From the beginning of time, the rock was smoothed
and cleaned by Heaven and Earth, by the strong

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,830
sun and the gentle moon, until one day it
broke into two pieces and gave birth to a

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,890
stone egg, about as big as a child's ball.

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,350
From the egg came a stone monkey.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,340
At once, this monkey learned to climb and
run.

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,559
But first, it looked north and south and east
and west.

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,200
As it looked, a strange light came from its
eyes.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,880
The light shone as far as the Jade Emperor,
who sat in the Cloud Palace of the Golden

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,459
Gates.

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,810
The Jade Emperor asked his ministers to open
the gate of the Southern Heaven and look out

15
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,190
at the light.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:23,159
'This light,' reported the ministers, 'comes
from the small country of Ao-lai, to the east

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,210
of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.'

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,310
And in the country of Ao-lai, the monkey ran
and jumped.

19
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:38,780
He picked flowers, ate grass and fruit, and
drank from streams and rivers.

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,540
His friends were all the animals of that country,
and the other monkeys were his family.

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:54,619
At night, he slept among the rocks and in
the day he walked through the caves.

22
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:00,430
One day, the monkeys were washing in a stream
when one of them spoke.

23
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,540
'None of us knows where this stream comes
from.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,610
Let's follow it and find out.'

25
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,850
So they all ran up the stream until they came
to a great waterfall.

26
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,790
The monkeys shouted, 'Lovely water, lovely
water!

27
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,450
It starts in a mountain cave and runs all
the way to the Great Sea.

28
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,790
Who can find the place where the water comes
from?

29
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:39,680
If one of us could find this place and return
safely, we would make him our king!'

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,290
'I will go!'

31
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,629
shouted the Stone Monkey.

32
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,720
'I will go!'

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,770
Look at him!

34
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,300
He shuts his eyes, and with one big jump he
passes through the curtain of water.

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,270
But there is no water where he has landed.

36
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,370
Instead he finds a great, shining iron bridge
in front of him.

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,230
Monkey walked along the bridge and came to
a cave.

38
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,790
Outside the cave there was a sign: This Cave
of the Water Curtain in the Country of the

39
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,319
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Leads to Heaven.

40
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,120
Monkey laughed and jumped with happiness.

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,330
He ran back across the bridge, shut his eyes
and jumped through the waterfall to the other

42
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,330
monkeys.

43
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,480
'Good news!' he shouted.

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,630
'Good news!

45
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,200
Come with me, all of you!'

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,120
They followed the Stone Monkey to the Cave
of the Water Curtain.

47
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,630
There the Stone Monkey sat down and talked
to them.

48
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,459
'Gentlemen!' he said.

49
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,840
'I have been through the waterfall and have
come back again.

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,319
I have given you a home in this cave, so am
I not your king now?'

51
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,430
The monkeys bowed to the Stone Monkey and
they all cried, 'Great King for a thousand

52
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,470
years!'

53
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:28,389
The Stone Monkey became the Monkey King and
he made other monkeys his ministers.

54
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,809
And all the monkeys were happy.

55
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:37,949
During the day they walked and played on the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, and at night

56
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,909
they slept in the Cave of the Water Curtain.

57
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,509
They had everything they wanted.

58
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,219
Their lives were complete.

59
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:54,999
The Monkey King enjoyed this simple life for
several hundred years.

60
00:04:54,999 --> 00:05:02,509
But one day at a great party with all the
other monkeys, he suddenly started to cry.

61
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,930
The other monkeys all bowed, saying, 'Why
is our king so sad?'

62
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,199
'Today,' said the Monkey King, 'I am not sad.

63
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,779
But I am worried about the future.

64
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:23,860
Sadly, the time will come when I will become
old and weak.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,270
Yama, King of Death, is waiting to destroy
me.

66
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,210
I do not want to be born again on Earth.

67
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,949
How can I live for all time among the people
of the sky?'

68
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:45,939
The monkeys all started to cry, each thinking
of his own mortality.

69
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:54,059
One of them said, 'Only Buddhas and Immortals
do not go to Yama, King of Death.

70
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,149
Only they live forever.'

71
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,810
'Where can I find these Immortals?'

72
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,419
asked the Monkey King.

73
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:09,430
'Here on Earth they live in very old caves
far to the West.'

74
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,399
'Tomorrow,' said the Monkey King, 'I shall
say goodbye to you.

75
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,419
I shall go down the mountain and travel to
the end of the world.

76
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:27,969
I want to learn to live for all time and to
escape from death.'

77
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:35,259
Next morning, he walked to the sea and sailed
in a boat to the borders of the Southern World.

78
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,789
There he climbed out on to the beach.

79
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:47,919
And then he walked and walked, through towns
and cities, to the West.

80
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,860
On the way, he learned to wear clothes and
to behave like a human.

81
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,580
But he met humans who wanted only to be rich
and famous.

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,039
He met nobody who worried about his mortality.

83
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,659
One day, he came to the Western Ocean, where
he built another boat.

84
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:18,399
Then he sailed to the Western Continent, where
he saw a very high and beautiful wooded mountain.

85
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:26,009
At the top of the mountain was the Cave of
the Moon and Three Stars, where the Immortal

86
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,650
Subodhi lived.

87
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,180
Monkey at once bowed and touched the ground
with his head three times.

88
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,110
'Where do you come from?' asked the Immortal.

89
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,379
'I am from the Cave of the Water Curtain,'
said Monkey, 'on the Mountain of Flowers and

90
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,099
Fruit in the country of Ao-lai.'

91
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,129
'That is impossible!'

92
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,989
shouted the Immortal.

93
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:58,679
'Between there and here are two oceans and
the whole of the Southern Continent.

94
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,709
You are lying!'

95
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:08,169
'I have sailed across the oceans and walked
over the continents for more than ten years,'

96
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,169
said Monkey.

97
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,860
'At last I have reached here.'

98
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,050
Monkey told the Immortal how he had come from
a magic stone.

99
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,520
The Immortal thought that Monkey was a natural
product of Heaven and Earth, so he agreed

100
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
to teach him.

101
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,300
Monkey jumped up and down with happiness.

102
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,979
Day after day, he and the other students learned
to speak and behave correctly.

103
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,328
They learned to write well and to study the
Scriptures.

104
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:47,959
When they were not studying, the students
grew flowers and trees.

105
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,350
They lit fires and fetched water.

106
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,800
And so Monkey lived in this way for six or
seven years.

107
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,170
Finally, the Immortal sent for Monkey late
one night because he wanted to teach him the

108
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,279
Way of Long Life.

109
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,250
'Come close and listen carefully,' said the
Immortal.

110
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,290
Monkey went down on his knees on the floor
at the Immortal's feet, listening carefully.

111
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,730
The Immortal recited a magic poem with many
lines.

112
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:33,110
The words shook Monkey's soul and he was never
the same Monkey again.

113
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,379
He thanked the Immortal many times, because
now he knew the Way of Long Life.

114
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:49,060
Time passed quickly and three years later
the Immortal again invited Monkey to his room,

115
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,279
where he taught him seventy-two transformations.

116
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,190
Monkey was a quick learner and he practised
until he could change himself into something

117
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,490
else, using all seventy-two ways.

118
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,500
One day, when the Immortal and his students
were in front of the cave admiring the evening

119
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,470
view, the Immortal spoke to Monkey.

120
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,350
'Monkey, how much have you learned?'

121
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,130
'Thanks to you,' said Monkey, 'I have learned
a lot.

122
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:30,220
In addition to changing myself into other
forms, I can already fly.'

123
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,180
'Let me see you do it,' said the Immortal.

124
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,150
Monkey put his feet together, jumped twenty
metres into the air and rode the clouds for

125
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,930
a few minutes.

126
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:51,110
Then he dropped to the ground, saying, 'You
see, I can ride the clouds.'

127
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,380
'That is not riding the clouds,' said the
Immortal, laughing.

128
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:04,050
'A real cloud-rider can start in the morning
from the Northern Sea, cross the Eastern,

129
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:10,640
the Western and the Southern Seas and land
again in one day.'

130
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,910
'It sounds very difficult,' said Monkey.

131
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,750
'Nothing in the world is difficult,' said
the Immortal.

132
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,220
'Only our own thoughts make things seem difficult.

133
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:32,189
Now I will teach you to fly from one continent
to another.'

134
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:38,980
The other students laughed, saying, 'If Monkey
flies all that way, he will be able to earn

135
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,519
a living as a postman.'

136
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,220
But Monkey spent all night practising what
the Immortal had taught him.

137
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,069
By morning he could fly wherever he wanted.

138
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,089
One summer day, some students were sitting
under a tree.

139
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:05,290
A student said, 'Monkey, why do you deserve
private teaching by the Immortal?

140
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,189
Has he taught you the transformations, by
all the seventy-two ways?'

141
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:18,040
'I have been working on them day and night
and now I can do them all,' said Monkey.

142
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
'Could you show us?'

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,209
Proudly, Monkey made a magic sign, said some
magic words and transformed himself into a

144
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,220
tree.

145
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,980
'Well done, Monkey, well done!'

146
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,310
shouted the other students.

147
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,029
They all laughed.

148
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,810
The Immortal heard their laughter and he came
running out from the cave.

149
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,770
'Who is making all this noise?' he asked.

150
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,850
Monkey changed himself back from a tree to
a monkey.

151
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,920
He sat with the students again and said, 'Immortal,
we are practising our lessons out here.'

152
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,749
'You were all shouting and laughing!' said
the Immortal, angrily.

153
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:10,200
'I want to know why.'

154
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:18,430
Then one student said, 'Monkey was transforming
himself into a tree, just for fun.'

155
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,100
'You, Monkey, come here!'

156
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,279
shouted the Immortal.

157
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,889
'Why do you think I taught you these secrets
of life?

158
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:32,220
So you can make other people laugh?'

159
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,529
'I am very sorry,' said Monkey.

160
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,760
'I will not punish you,' said the Immortal.

161
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,949
'But you cannot stay here.

162
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,809
You must leave us.'

163
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:49,410
Monkey started to cry.

164
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,259
'Where can I go?' he asked.

165
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,579
'Go back to where you came from.

166
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:00,069
Go as quickly as you can.

167
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,949
Never tell anyone that you were a student
of mine.

168
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:09,839
I am sure that no good will come of your life.'

169
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,699
And so poor Monkey said goodbye to everybody.

170
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:20,240
He flew back to the Eastern Sea and his home
in the Cave of the Water Curtain on the Mountain

171
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,579
of Flowers and Fruit.

172
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:29,420
'Little ones,' shouted the Monkey King, 'I
have come back!'

173
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:37,390
At once, big and small monkeys leapt out of
trees with cries of 'Long live our King!'

174
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:45,470
Then, pushing each other to get near him,
they cried, 'Why did you go for so long?

175
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,230
We have been watching for your return day
after day!

176
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:57,449
While you were away, a demon took our cave
and everything we own and many of our children.

177
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,160
Now we dare not sleep, night or day.'

178
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,569
'What demon dares to do this?'

179
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,569
cried Monkey.

180
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,379
'I will make him pay!'

181
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:16,040
'King, he is called the Destroying Demon,
and he lives north of here.

182
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,940
But he comes and goes like a cloud, like wind,
like rain, like thunder and lightning, so

183
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,629
we do not know where his home is or how far
away.'

184
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,639
'Well, don't worry,' said Monkey.

185
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,059
'I will go and look for him.'

186
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,300
Dear Monkey!

187
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,149
He leapt into the sky and soon saw in front
of him a high mountain and a cave, where the

188
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:48,740
Destroying Demon was waiting for him.

189
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,009
'Where is the owner of the Cave of the Water
Curtain?'

190
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:55,690
cried the Demon.

191
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:02,819
'You have such large eyes,' shouted Monkey,
'but you cannot see Monkey?'

192
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,389
'Oh!

193
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,149
You are not half a metre high!

194
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:14,189
If I killed such a small creature with my
sword, I would look foolish.'

195
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:20,720
So the two of them fought with their hands
and feet, hitting and kicking each other.

196
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,100
Soon the Demon was fighting like a wild animal.

197
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,009
Monkey pulled out some hairs from his chest
and, crying 'Change!'

198
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:33,259
threw them into the air.

199
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,399
At once, they became several hundred small
monkeys.

200
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,149
See how the monkeys jump on the Demon, pulling
and hitting him.

201
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:50,870
Then Monkey takes up the Demon's great sword
and brings it down on his head, breaking it

202
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,300
in two.

203
00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:01,050
Then, by his magic, he transforms all the
monkeys back into hairs.

204
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,369
When Monkey returned home to the cave on the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, he brought

205
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:12,639
the great sword of the Destroying Demon, and
he amused the other monkeys by teaching them

206
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,199
to make weapons of wood.

207
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,919
Then, one day, the Monkey King called all
the other monkeys to him.

208
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,980
'All this,' he said, pointing to their wooden
weapons, 'is only a game.

209
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,020
We cannot defend ourselves from a real enemy
with these.'

210
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,279
'We know a city that is full of soldiers.

211
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,240
They must have plenty of weapons,' the others
said.

212
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,210
They quickly told Monkey where it was.

213
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,770
'Stay here and amuse yourselves,' Monkey said.

214
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,789
'I will see what I can do.'

215
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,510
Dear Monkey!

216
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:03,279
Using his magic, he flew to the city and,
with his breath, blew such a strong wind that

217
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,240
all the people locked themselves indoors.

218
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,159
This was his chance.

219
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,450
He found where the weapons were kept, kicked
down the door, and changed his hairs into

220
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,020
thousands of small monkeys who took the weapons.

221
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,059
Carried on a magic wind, they were soon back
at the cave.

222
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:33,370
The monkeys learned to use the weapons, and
all sorts of wild animals and demon kings

223
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:39,000
began to call Monkey their king.

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,610
But Monkey found his own weapon too heavy,
so he went to the Dragon of the Eastern Sea

225
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,770
in search of something lighter.

226
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,529
The Dragon King welcomed him to the palace,
with his dragon children, dragon grandchildren

227
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,370
and fish soldiers.

228
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,750
Monkey made his request, and a fish soldier
brought out a great sword.

229
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,779
'Too heavy,' said Monkey.

230
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,700
More fish soldiers brought out an enormous
fork.

231
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,040
'Too light,' said Monkey.

232
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,390
The dragon mother and her daughter came from
a back room in the palace and suggested their

233
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,900
magic iron cudgel.

234
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,681
'The Gods used it when they decided how deep
the rivers and the seas should be,' said the

235
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,100
Dragon King.

236
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,200
He agreed that Monkey should have it.

237
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,010
When it was brought, Monkey saw that it was
a thick piece of iron six metres long.

238
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,500
He used his magic to bring it down to less
than a metre.

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,850
Then he waved it over his head, striking terror
into everybody in the room.

240
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:06,750
But now he demanded something to wear, to
go with the weapon, and this was too much.

241
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:15,269
A pair of cloud-stepping shoes, a cap of red
gold and a coat of light metal were brought

242
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:22,870
to him, but the angry Dragon King also sent
for his brothers from the Southern, Northern

243
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:29,299
and Western Seas and told them about Monkey's
many requests.

244
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,100
The Dragon of the South was angry.

245
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,549
'Put him in prison!' he cried.

246
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,409
'No, no,' warned the Dragon King.

247
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,450
'We cannot go near him now.

248
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,520
If he touches us with that iron cudgel, he
will kill us.

249
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,170
Let him keep the clothes.

250
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:57,180
We will complain to Heaven, and Heaven will
punish him.'

251
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,270
Monkey took the clothes, but he knew that
they were going to complain about him.

252
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,390
Soon after that, the Jade Emperor received
the complaint from the Dragon of the Eastern

253
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,810
Sea.

254
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:20,900
'How long,' the Jade Emperor asked his ministers,
'has this Monkey existed, and why does he

255
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,350
behave like an Immortal?'

256
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,980
'In the last three hundred years, he has learned
a lot,' said a minister.

257
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:38,340
'Let's give him work here in Heaven where
we will be able to watch hint.'

258
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,919
This suggestion pleased the Jade Emperor,
and a minister was sent to bring Monkey to

259
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,409
Heaven.

260
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:51,470
Monkey tidied his clothes, told the older
monkeys to look after the younger ones, and

261
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,950
followed the minister to Heaven.

262
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:00,130
'I am going to give you a job,' said the Jade
Emperor to Monkey.

263
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,550
'You are going to look after the Apple Garden.'

264
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:11,520
Monkey was very happy and ran to the Apple
Garden to start work.

265
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,730
He was told that on the outer side of the
garden were special apples.

266
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,890
They were ready to eat once in three thousand
years.

267
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:28,429
If you ate one of these, you would become
wise, with strong arms and legs and a light

268
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,929
body.

269
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:38,769
In the middle were trees with apples that
were ready to eat once in six thousand years.

270
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:46,580
If you ate these, you would go up in the air
and stay there, and would never grow old.

271
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:55,039
At the back were trees with apples chat were
ready to eat once in nine thousand years.

272
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,180
If you ate these, you would live longer than
Heaven and Earth.

273
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,730
Monkey was very happy with this information.

274
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:11,799
He watched the trees closely, making up his
mind to eat the fruit before anybody else

275
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,470
got a chance.

276
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,690
Soon, noticing that some apples were ready
to eat, he sent his helpers away.

277
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:28,270
He climbed into a high tree and ate until
he could eat no more.

278
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:34,720
When the Queen of Heaven sent her lady assistants
for apples, they were turned away at the gates

279
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,580
by Monkey's helpers.

280
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,770
'We must ask the Monkey King first,' they
said.

281
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,520
'He is resting in one of the trees.'

282
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,660
But when they came to the tree, they found
only Monkey's cap and shoes.

283
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,260
They could not see him.

284
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:01,610
In fact, Monkey had made himself five centimetres
long and was asleep under a leaf.

285
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,529
The Queen of Heaven's lady assistants picked
three basketfuls from each of the first two

286
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,909
groups of trees.

287
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:16,580
When they came to the third, they found just
one apple.

288
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,260
When one of the ladies tried to pick it, Monkey
woke up.

289
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,950
At once, he changed back to his true size.

290
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,450
'Who are you?'

291
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,360
shouted Monkey.

292
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,990
The lady assistants went down on their knees.

293
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,620
'Monkey King, don't be angry.

294
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,250
We were sent by the Queen and we could not
find you.

295
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,330
Please forgive us.'

296
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,740
'Get up from your knees,' said Monkey, his
voice full of kindness.

297
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,480
'I have heard that the Queen of Heaven is
having a banquet.

298
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,450
Can you tell me who is invited?'

299
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:03,860
Monkey was told that all the Immortals, Emperors
of the Four Quarters and Gods of the seas

300
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,610
and hills would be there.

301
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,880
He immediately asked, 'Will I be invited?'

302
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,530
'I have not heard,' said one of the lady assistants.

303
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,860
'We do not know.'

304
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,639
'Quite right, ladies,' said Monkey.

305
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,770
'Just wait here while I go and see.'

306
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,580
Dear Monkey!

307
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,799
He recited some magic lines, crying 'Stay,
stay, stay!'

308
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:43,600
The lady assistants were suddenly unable to
move while he went off on his magic cloud.

309
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,669
No one had arrived at the banquet yet, but
Monkey could smell the food and wine.

310
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,330
He sent the servants to sleep by magic.

311
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:01,190
Look at them, how their hands fall to their
sides, their heads drop on to their chests,

312
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,789
their eyes close!

313
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:11,429
Monkey then took some of the finest and best
of the food and drank glass after glass of

314
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,880
wine until he was quite drunk.

315
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,860
'Bad!

316
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,580
Bad!' he thought to himself.

317
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:30,850
'I will certainly get into trouble, so I will
go home and sleep.'

318
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,710
But it was too late for that.

319
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,630
Back at the Apple Garden, the Queen's ladies
were finally saved.

320
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:47,590
They reported that the Monkey King had eaten
many of the biggest apples and had now disappeared.

321
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,399
When the great Goddess Kuan-yin arrived for
the banquet, she found half the food eaten

322
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,090
and all the wine gone.

323
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:04,539
When the servants were woken, they explained
that the Monkey King had sent them to sleep.

324
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,850
That was the last time they had seen the food
and the wine.

325
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:16,270
The Jade Emperor was informed and he sent
heavenly soldiers to find Monkey.

326
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:24,090
Monkey was burned in fire for nine days, and
at the end of it his eyes were red but he

327
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,200
was still alive.

328
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,440
He was attacked with swords and the Gods of
Thunder threw thunder at him.

329
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,440
But nothing could destroy him.

330
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,169
In the end, hearing of this situation, the
great Buddha himself arrived and called Monkey

331
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,880
to him.

332
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:52,480
'How long ago,' he asked him, 'did you try
to become an Immortal and learn the things

333
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,370
that make you dare behave like this?'

334
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,980
Monkey at once recited:

335
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,740
Born of Earth and Sky, I am a magic Immortal.

336
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,000
I am an old monkey from the Mountain of Flowers
and Fruit;

337
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,770
In the Cave of the Water Curtain, I work and
laugh and play.

338
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,830
I found a friend and teacher who taught me
the Great Secret;

339
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:23,259
I made myself perfect in the Ways of Immortality,

340
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:27,289
I learned transformations without limit or
end,

341
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:33,200
I tired of the narrow world of men, and lived
in the Jade Heaven.

342
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,529
But why should Heaven's palace have only one
emperor?

343
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:43,640
On Earth king follows king, as the strong
bow to the stronger.

344
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,480
Only a hero fights with the Gods of Gods.

345
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,049
That was what Monkey recited.

346
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:53,330
Buddha laughed.

347
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,809
'But you are only a monkey-spirit,' he said.

348
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:04,440
'The Jade Emperor has been making himself
perfect for countless years.

349
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,230
How can you hope to take his place and become
emperor yourself?

350
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,659
You are only an animal that looks half human!

351
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,940
Talk no more of this.'

352
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,330
'Why should he be emperor for all time?

353
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,330
Tell him to go and to give me my chance,'
said Monkey.

354
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,620
'That is all I ask.

355
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,130
And if he will not, I will see that he never
has any peace.'

356
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,309
'What magic have you got that would help you
to take Heaven for yourself?'

357
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:43,419
'I have a lot of magic,' replied Monkey.

358
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:47,690
'I can jump through the clouds from continent
to continent.

359
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,990
Am I not good enough to live in the palaces
of Heaven?'

360
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:02,210
Buddha said, 'If you are really so clever,
you will sit here in my right hand and then

361
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,210
jump off.

362
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,240
If you succeed, you can become the Jade Emperor.

363
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:16,490
But if you fail, you will go back to Earth
and you will be punished for centuries.'

364
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,850
Monkey thought, 'This Buddha is a complete
fool.

365
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,970
How could I fail to jump off his hand!'

366
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,880
Buddha held out his hand, which looked about
the size of a large leaf.

367
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,159
Monkey took the magic iron cudgel that the
Dragon King had given him, and that he had

368
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,649
transformed into a stick the size of a needle.

369
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:48,510
He put it behind his ear and then he jumped
from the hand as far and as fast as he could.

370
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:55,590
He was flying very fast, but Buddha watched
him with the eye of wisdom.

371
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,629
Monkey came at last to five high pink towers.

372
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:05,200
'This must be the end of the world,' said
Monkey to himself.

373
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,350
'Now I will return to Buddha, become emperor,
and all Heaven will be mine.

374
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:18,169
But I had better leave some sign that I was
here.'

375
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:25,260
Pulling out a hair, he changed it into a writing-brush
heavy with ink, and at the bottom of the middle

376
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:33,350
tower he wrote: The great Monkey King reached
this place.

377
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,230
Then he jumped back to where he had come from.

378
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,120
Standing on Buddha's hand, he said, 'I have
gone and I have returned.

379
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,029
You can tell the Jade Emperor that his job
is mine.'

380
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:56,840
'You smelly creature,' said Buddha, 'you have
been on my hand all the time.'

381
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,549
'You are completely wrong,' said Monkey.

382
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:06,600
'I travelled to the end of the world, saw
five pink towers and wrote on one of them.

383
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,980
Would you like me to take you and show you?'

384
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,130
'No need,' said Buddha.

385
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,580
'Just look down.'

386
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,450
Monkey looked down, with his eyes still red
from the nine days of fire.

387
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:29,409
There, at the bottom of the middle finger
of Buddha's hand, he saw the words "The great

388
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:34,600
Monkey King reached this place."

389
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,730
Monkey could not speak and his red eyes opened
wide in surprise.

390
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,769
At last he said, 'Impossible!

391
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:44,769
Impossible!

392
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:49,690
I wrote that on a tower going high into the
sky.

393
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,279
How did it get on the Buddha's finger?

394
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,789
It is magic!

395
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,240
I shall go back to look!'

396
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
Dear Monkey!

397
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,780
He was preparing to jump again when Buddha
pushed him out of the Western Gate of Heaven.

398
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:16,220
As he did, he changed his five fingers into
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth.

399
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:24,110
They became a mountain which pressed poor
Monkey down with its great weight.

400
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:31,330
The name Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire
and Earth was written on a large rock on the

401
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,549
mountain.

402
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:40,129
Under the mountain there was enough air for
Monkey to breathe, but no opening which Monkey's

403
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:44,760
head or hand could squeeze through.

404
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,730
Buddha then told a spirit to look after Monkey
and give him food and drink.

405
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:59,830
'And when the days of his punishment are finished,'
said Buddha, 'a man will come here and save

406
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,200
him.'

407
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,409
Time passed, and then one day the Buddha said
to his followers, 'I have noticed a lot of

408
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:16,489
difference between the people who live in
the four continents of the world.

409
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:23,059
The people in the East are polite, peaceful
and cheerful.

410
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:29,620
People in the North are lazy and stupid, so
do little harm.

411
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:37,920
In our Western Continent, there is no killing,
although there is little real wisdom.

412
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,150
But in the South, they are greedy and murderous.

413
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:48,480
A knowledge of the True Scriptures might improve
them.'

414
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,840
'Do you have these Scriptures?'

415
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,679
asked his followers.

416
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,250
'Yes, three baskets of them,' said Buddha.

417
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:06,550
'One speaks of Heaven, another of Earth, and
a third can save people from the Wrong Way.

418
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:13,820
These are the path to perfection, the only
gate to the True Way.

419
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:20,150
But down in the real world, people are so
stupid that they laugh at them.

420
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,980
I need to find someone who will go to the
Eastern land.

421
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,960
There he might find a believer who could come
here from China.

422
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,760
I would give this believer the Scriptures
to take back to China and change the hearts

423
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,150
of the people.'

424
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,430
The Goddess Kuan-yin came forward and bowed
three times.

425
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:53,160
'I would like to go to the Eastern land and
find someone to fetch the Scriptures.'

426
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,410
'Who would be better than you!' said Buddha.

427
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:05,660
So Kuan-yin called her bodyguard, Hui-yen,
who carried a great iron cudgel, and they

428
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,680
started at once.

429
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,480
After they had travelled a long way, they
came to the River of Sands.

430
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,820
There, a horribly ugly creature leapt out
of the water and began a terrible fight with

431
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,160
the bodyguard.

432
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,100
Suddenly, the creature stopped fighting, looked
hard at the bodyguard and asked, 'Who dares

433
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,560
to fight with me?

434
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,480
Surely I have seen you before in the gardens
of the Goddess Kuan-yin?'

435
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,790
'The Goddess herself is here, in front of
you,' Hui-yen replied.

436
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,080
'I ask you to forgive me!'

437
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
cried the creature.

438
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,160
'I am not really the ugly creature that you
see.

439
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,960
I was given this horrible shape as a punishment
for a crime that I did in Heaven.

440
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,370
I was sent to the world below, where I am
always hungry and I must attack travellers

441
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,990
and eat them.'

442
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:13,120
'But you are adding new crimes on Earth to
your crime in Heaven by killing people,' said

443
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,660
the Goddess Kuan-yin.

444
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,970
'Why not come with us?

445
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:23,000
If our journey is successful, you will be
forgiven and allowed to return to Heaven.'

446
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,320
'I would gladly go back,' the creature answered.

447
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,790
'But I have eaten so many humans.

448
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:38,670
Even now, nine heads are lying on the waters
of the River of Sands.

449
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,250
I have played games with them and I do not
think I will be allowed back into Heaven after

450
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,960
that.'

451
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,950
'Don't be silly,' she replied.

452
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,520
'Take the heads and hang them round your neck.

453
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,350
I shall make you a priest and give you the
name "Sandy Priest".

454
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:03,980
Wait here and never again take a human life.

455
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,200
You will see that a man will come this way.

456
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,800
He will be looking for the Scriptures and
a good use will be found for the nine heads.'

457
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,740
So the Goddess and her bodyguard continued
their journey and came to a high mountain

458
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,270
with a most horrible smell.

459
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:32,460
A dirty, smelly, piglike creature leapt out
and attacked Kuan-yin with a great fork and

460
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,920
fought hard with her bodyguard.

461
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:42,440
For safety, Kuan-yin stood in the sky above
them and then threw down flowers, which fell

462
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,110
between the bodyguard's cudgel and the fork.

463
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,770
'Fighting with flowers?'

464
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,770
cried the pig.

465
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,760
'What kind of priest are you?'

466
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,780
'The great Goddess Kuan-yin threw them down
on us from her cloud, where she is standing,'

467
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,250
replied the bodyguard.

468
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,760
At once, the pig bowed to the sky.

469
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,350
'Forgive me, Goddess, forgive me!

470
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,150
I am not really a pig at all.

471
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:15,670
For a crime in Heaven, the Jade Emperor sent
me down here.'

472
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,520
'This is a chance for you,' said Kuan-yin.

473
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,750
'We are on our way to China to look for a
man who will collect the Scriptures.

474
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,410
If you went with him to India, we would forgive
all your crimes.'

475
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,670
'I will!

476
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,460
I will!'

477
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,560
the pig-like creature shouted.

478
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,160
So they gave him the name of Pigsy, and left
him to watch for the pilgrim who would collect

479
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,740
the Scriptures.

480
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:54,170
The Goddess and her bodyguard went on their
way and soon they met a dragon who had fought

481
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,810
against the Gods.

482
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,890
'Can you help me?'

483
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,830
the dragon cried out.

484
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,250
Kuan-yin went back to Heaven.

485
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:10,670
She asked the Gods to forgive the dragon if
he would transform himself into a white horse

486
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,390
and carry the pilgrim to India.

487
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:20,990
Continuing their journey, the Goddess and
her bodyguard suddenly saw a mountain covered

488
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,510
in magic fog and lit by golden light from
Heaven.

489
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:32,770
They recognised it at once as the mountain
which covered the Monkey King.

490
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,810
Kuan-yin looked sad and recited:

491
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,510
Long ago he was purposelessly brave.

492
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,770
In his blackness of heart he spoiled the Heavenly
Apple Banquet

493
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,100
And tried to take the place of the Jade Emperor.

494
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,050
Will he ever again be free and win back his
name?

495
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:02,120
Then came a voice from inside the mountain:
'Who is reciting a list of my crimes?'

496
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,840
Kuan-yin found the spirit who looked after
Monkey.

497
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:13,760
This spirit led her to Monkey's prison under
the mountain, which was a kind of stone box.

498
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,430
Monkey looked out through a thin opening with
his red eyes and cried, 'You are the Goddess

499
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,390
Kuan-yin!

500
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,370
Why have you come here?

501
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:30,910
Buddha tricked me and I have sat in this little
box for five hundred years.

502
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:39,420
But I am very sorry for the things I have
done and now I want to do good in the world.'

503
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,020
Kuan-yin was very happy.

504
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:50,570
'Just wait quietly here until I return with
my pilgrim and he will save you,' she said.

505
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:59,460
And so they left Monkey and went on to the
East, to find the pilgrim.

506
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,640
CHAPTER TWO
The Journey Begins

507
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,350
'I can tell you that I have killed quite a
lot of people.

508
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,800
And I am still the great Monkey King!' answered
Monkey.

509
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,620
At a time when the great and very old city
of Ch'ang-an was the capital of China, there

510
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,700
was an examination to find the cleverest men
in the country.

511
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,310
These men would do the work of the government.

512
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:36,230
A man by the name of Ch'en O decided to try
his luck at the examination, as it was his

513
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,330
mother's wish.

514
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,260
Arriving late, he found that the examination
had begun.

515
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:51,600
But to his surprise, he won first place and
he received a letter signed by the Emperor.

516
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,210
In those days, the winner of first place in
the examination was led through the streets

517
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,800
on horseback.

518
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,600
And by chance, on that day, the only daughter
of a minister sat in her high tower with a

519
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,580
ball in her hand.

520
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:15,030
Seeing the handsome Ch'en riding by, and knowing
of his success in the examination, she threw

521
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,510
the ball cleverly on to his hat.

522
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,840
This was how a lady chose her husband.

523
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,790
No time was wasted.

524
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:29,630
Ch'en and the minister's daughter were married,
and hand in hand they went into the bedroom

525
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,700
as man and wife.

526
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,980
Early next morning, Ch'en was made Governor
of Chiang-chou and, as he was told to begin

527
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:44,490
work at once, he started on the journey with
his wife.

528
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,880
It was late spring.

529
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,700
There was a gentle wind in the trees and a
light rain fell.

530
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,490
The road to Chiang-chou took Ch'en and his
wife close to his home, so they stopped at

531
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,190
his mother's house.

532
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:05,600
Ch'en said to his mother, 'You wanted me to
take the examination, and look at all the

533
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,900
good luck that has come from it.

534
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,800
I would like to thank you and to ask you to
come with us.'

535
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,390
His mother happily agreed and after travelling
for some days, the three arrived at the Hotel

536
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,520
of Ten Thousand Flowers.

537
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,990
But here the mother suddenly became ill and
asked to rest.

538
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:34,190
Next day, a man arrived with a gold-coloured
fish for sale and young Ch'en bought it for

539
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,570
his mother.

540
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,960
Suddenly, he noticed that the fish's eyes
were strange.

541
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,520
'This is not an ordinary creature,' he said.

542
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,360
He asked where it was caught and then returned
it to the river in the same place.

543
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,460
'You were right to put the fish back in the
river,' said his mother when he told her about

544
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,700
the fish's eyes.

545
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:04,890
Then she said, 'Leave me here with some of
the luggage and I shall follow when the days

546
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,890
are cooler.'

547
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:14,370
When Ch'en, his wife and servants arrived
at the same river, they were met by two boatmen

548
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,350
who Ch'en had harmed in an earlier life.

549
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:22,190
They stared at his young wife, who was very
beautiful.

550
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:28,440
Then they took the boat to a lonely place
and killed first the servants and then Ch'en

551
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,760
himself.

552
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,190
The young woman tried to throw herself into
the river, but they stopped her.

553
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,140
One of the murderers, whose name was Liu,
put on the Governor's clothes, took the official

554
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,540
papers and left for Chiang-chou with Mrs Ch'en.

555
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:53,650
Liu left the boat with the other boatman,
Li, who threw the bodies into the river.

556
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,140
The bodies of the servants could be seen on
the river, but Ch'en's body went straight

557
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,490
to the bottom.

558
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:07,230
A servant of the Dragon King saw it there
and went to the palace to tell the Dragon

559
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,840
King himself.

560
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,600
The Dragon King asked to see it.

561
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,450
When Ch'en's body was brought to him, he recognised
this man.

562
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:24,020
In the body of a gold-coloured fish, the Dragon
King had been saved by him only a few days

563
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,080
before.

564
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,640
In return for Ch'en's kindness, the Dragon
King sent his servant to the place where the

565
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,650
souls of the newly dead go.

566
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:42,850
The servant returned with Ch'en's soul and
Ch'en woke from the dead.

567
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:49,370
When he had heard Ch'en's story, the Dragon
King said, 'You certainly helped me.

568
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,300
So I shall now give you back your life.

569
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,790
I want you to work in my Water Office.'

570
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:05,230
While this was happening, Mrs Ch'en was so
unhappy with Liu that she could not eat or

571
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,320
sleep.

572
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,500
But because she was going to have her husband's
child, she thought it was best to follow this

573
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,730
terrible man quietly.

574
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:23,200
After a long journey they reached Chiang-chou,
where Liu the boatman became the new governor.

575
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,690
Time passed and Mrs Ch'en gave birth to a
son.

576
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:36,920
At the same time a mysterious voice whispered
in her ear, 'Listen to what I am telling you.

577
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,620
This child will be famous around the world.

578
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:46,880
But you must protect him from Liu, who will
certainly try to harm him.

579
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:54,430
Your husband is safe with the Dragon King
and one day you will all be together again

580
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:59,430
and your enemies will be punished.'

581
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,620
Then there was silence.

582
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:09,310
Mrs Ch'en held her son in her arms, but she
could think of no other way to protect him.

583
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:15,900
And as the voice had said, when Liu returned
he ordered the death of the child.

584
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,920
But the unhappy mother wanted more time with
her son.

585
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,850
'I will put him in the river tomorrow,' she
promised Liu.

586
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:31,390
'Perhaps,' she thought, 'a kind god will save
him.'

587
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:38,990
She bit her finger and, with her blood, wrote
a letter giving the names of the child's parents.

588
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:45,430
Then, so that she would know her child again,
she bit off the top of the little toe of his

589
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,570
left foot.

590
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,250
When morning came, she tied the baby into
one of her shirts and went quietly down to

591
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,230
the river with him.

592
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:01,970
As she stood at the water's edge, a large
piece of wood came down the river.

593
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:07,950
Quickly, she tied the shirt with the baby
in it to the wood and put the letter she had

594
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,790
written in the shirt.

595
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:17,270
Then she pushed the wood to the centre of
the river and walked back, crying every step

596
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,760
of the way.

597
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,590
The piece of wood with the baby on it was
carried at last to the Temple of the Golden

598
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,000
Mountain.

599
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,390
The Holy Master, hearing the sound of a baby
crying, went to the river and found the strange

600
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,070
boat.

601
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:41,050
He read the letter about the child's father,
and immediately gave the child the name of

602
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,250
River Wood.

603
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:48,510
Then he asked some farmers to look after him.

604
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,890
Seventeen years later, the young man had been
given the new name of Hsuan Tsang and had

605
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,030
been made a priest in the Holy Master's temple.

606
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,750
One day an old and stupid priest cried out,
'Who do you think you are?

607
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,920
No one even knows your real name!'

608
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,400
He was jealous of the young man's wisdom.

609
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,350
The unhappy boy ran to the Holy Master.

610
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:19,770
'Can there be,' he asked, 'a man without a
father or mother?'

611
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:25,610
From a hiding-place in his room, the Holy
Master took down a small box containing the

612
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,980
blood-letter and the shirt.

613
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:34,950
Soon Hsuan Tsang knew the whole story and
the terrible wrong done to his parents.

614
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,420
He wanted to kill his father's murderer.

615
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:45,690
'If you must go,' said the Holy Master, 'take
these things with you.

616
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:50,960
Travel as a poor priest, go to Chiang-chou
and demand to see your mother.'

617
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,580
That same night, his mother dreamed of a moon
behind the clouds.

618
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:03,390
When the clouds moved, she saw a full moon,
and then she thought of her son.

619
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,640
'He must be seventeen by now.

620
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,280
Perhaps Heaven will bring us together again.'

621
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:17,020
Suddenly, she heard a priest asking for money
at the gate and went out to him.

622
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:23,770
When she heard his place of birth, the Golden
Mountain, she looked at him closely and said,

623
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:27,470
'Little priest, you are very like my husband.

624
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,470
Who were your parents?'

625
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,950
'A wrong was done to my parents,' was the
answer.

626
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,800
'My Holy Master told me to come here and find
my mother.

627
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,330
My father's name is Ch'en, but my holy name
is Hsuan Tsang.'

628
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:48,380
Then he took from the box the blood-letter
and the shirt.

629
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:54,510
She recognised them at once and she put her
arms around him.

630
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,510
'Leave me, leave me!'

631
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,510
she cried.

632
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,760
'If Liu finds you, he will kill you.

633
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,670
Go now, as fast as lightning!

634
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:07,310
But tomorrow I will say that I have promised
a hundred pairs of shoes to the poor and I

635
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,430
must journey to the temple to offer this present
to the Gods.

636
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:15,100
There we can talk.'

637
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:21,700
True to her promise, within five days a hundred
pairs of shoes were put on a boat and, with

638
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:26,550
some servants, she made the journey to the
Golden Mountain.

639
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:32,540
All the priests came out to welcome the visitor,
but when she had prayed she asked them to

640
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,870
leave.

641
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:40,240
Then, on her knees in front of Hsuan Tsang,
she took off the shoe and sock from his left

642
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,240
foot.

643
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:47,150
As she expected, the top of his left toe was
missing.

644
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:52,461
Again the mother and son put their arms around
each other, and she thanked the Holy Master

645
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,300
for his great kindness.

646
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,750
Then she gave Hsuan Tsang a ring to take to
the Hotel of Ten Thousand Flowers, where his

647
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,420
grandmother had been left behind.

648
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,720
'Here, also, is a letter to my father in the
capital,' she said.

649
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:16,760
'Tell him to ask the Emperor to send horses
and men to kill Liu and save me.

650
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,750
Now I dare not stay any longer, but must return
home.'

651
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:29,320
Hsuan Tsang went to the Hotel of Ten Thousand
Flowers and asked about his grandmother.

652
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,120
The owner of the hotel told him, 'The lady
was here for several years.

653
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:42,220
But she went blind and now, asking people
in the streets for money, she lives in a box.'

654
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,830
Hsuan Tsang finally found his poor grandmother,
who cried, 'Oh!

655
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,550
I thought my son had forgotten me!

656
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:56,890
And now Heaven has sent a grandson to find
me.'

657
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:02,900
After paying her bills and leaving her in
a comfortable room at the hotel, Hsuan Tsang

658
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,360
rushed back to the capital and to the house
of Minister Yin.

659
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,440
But they refused to let him in.

660
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,820
'No one in our family is a priest,' he was
told.

661
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,870
'Last night I dreamed about my daughter,'
said the wife.

662
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,190
'Perhaps he has a message from her.'

663
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:28,430
Hsuan Tsang bowed to them and took out the
letter that his mother had written.

664
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,610
The minister cried, 'Wife!

665
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,200
This is our grandchild.

666
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,000
Ch'en has been killed and our daughter has
been forced to live with the murderer.

667
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,400
I will ask the Emperor for soldiers to kill
that man.'

668
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,050
The Emperor was wild with anger and sent an
army of sixty thousand men to Chiang-chou.

669
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:56,650
They easily found Liu and took him away to
cut his head off.

670
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,630
Now Yin sent for his daughter.

671
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,580
She did not wish to see her father because
she was ashamed.

672
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,740
Had she not lived as the wife of her husband's
murderer?

673
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,040
But Yin told her that it was not her fault.

674
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:17,540
He put his arms around her and around his
grandson and kept them in his arms for a long,

675
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,040
long time.

676
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:27,800
By now, the soldiers had found the other boatman,
Li, and had cut his head off too.

677
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,010
And where he had killed Ch'en, Li's body was
cut open.

678
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:37,200
His heart was offered to the soul of the man
he had killed.

679
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:43,130
The Dragon King heard of this and he sent
a message to Ch'en.

680
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,920
'Congratulations!

681
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:51,450
Your wife and her father and your child are
all by the river, offering the heart of the

682
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,460
man who killed you.

683
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,720
I will now return your soul to you and let
you go.'

684
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,880
Mrs Ch'en wanted to throw herself into the
river where her husband had died, but suddenly

685
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,880
a body came up from the bottom of the river.

686
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,820
Mrs Ch'en recognised it as her husband's body
and cried and screamed.

687
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:24,390
The hands moved, and then the legs, and then
the whole body, until Ch'en himself climbed

688
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,940
out of the water.

689
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:32,350
He looked at them in great surprise and said,
'What are you all doing here?'

690
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:38,760
A great banquet was ordered and next day they
all left for home.

691
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,080
On the way, they called at the Hotel of Ten
Thousand Flowers for the grandmother and took

692
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,810
her back to the capital.

693
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,730
At last Chen became a government advisor.

694
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:59,240
His son, Hsuan Tsang, went back to his work
as a priest at the Temple of the Golden Mountain.

695
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,490
But when the Emperor died, priests all over
China were asked to choose the holiest priest,

696
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,390
and they chose Hsuan Tsang.

697
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:17,151
At this time, the search was still continuing
for a priest holy enough to fetch the Scriptures

698
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:19,680
from India.

699
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,970
The Goddess Kuan-yin, realising that the holiest
priest was River Wood, said to herself, 'No

700
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:30,290
one could be a better man than him.'

701
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:36,980
In the great city of Ch'ang-an, the new Emperor
asked Hsuan Tsang to go to India and fetch

702
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,390
the Scriptures.

703
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:45,460
When Hsuan Tsang agreed to go, the Emperor
said, 'If you dare to go on a journey as long

704
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:54,080
as this, with all its dangers, I will make
you here and now the brother of my soul.'

705
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,220
Then he bowed four times.

706
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:03,040
'If I do not reach India and do not bring
the Scriptures back to China, I must be sent

707
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,950
to Hell,' the young priest replied.

708
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:13,970
The Emperor called for wine and said, 'I suggest
that you take the name of the Scriptures in

709
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,920
India - Tripitaka.

710
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,390
What do you think?'

711
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:31,460
Hsuan Tsang accepted the name and from that
day he was called Tripitaka.

712
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:38,410
It was three days before the full moon when
Tripitaka left the gates of Ch'ang-an.

713
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:43,670
After a day or two of hard riding, he reached
the Temple of the Low Cloud.

714
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:50,710
There the Holy Master and almost five hundred
priests discussed his journey and its terrible

715
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,070
dangers and difficulties.

716
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,460
Tripitaka pointed in silence to his heart.

717
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,500
'It is only the heart that can win against
difficulties.

718
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:09,250
I have made my promise and I cannot go back
until I have reached India, seen Buddha and

719
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,290
got the Scriptures.'

720
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,830
Next morning, Tripitaka got up early.

721
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:20,590
A bright moon was shining on the snow on the
ground as he left.

722
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:28,080
Almost immediately, he lost his way, and suddenly
the ground moved under his horse.

723
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,860
The horse and rider fell into a deep hole.

724
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,930
'Take him!

725
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,660
Take him!'

726
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:42,360
Looking up, Tripitaka saw a crowd of ugly
creatures looking down at him.

727
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,430
They pulled him out of the hole.

728
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:51,830
Their leader was an ugly Demon King, who gave
orders to eat him.

729
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:58,440
But two dark ugly creatures arrived as guests,
and two other men were brought out as a meal

730
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,950
for them.

731
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:06,430
The ugly creatures ate like wild animals,
their teeth pulling at the men until they

732
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,410
had completely eaten them.

733
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:14,140
Watching this, Tripitaka was almost dead with
fear.

734
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,460
But then all the ugly creatures went to sleep.

735
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,370
Tripitaka was losing all hope of escape when
suddenly an old man appeared.

736
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:32,300
He blew in Tripitaka's face and asked him
if the horse belonged to him.

737
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,940
Tripitaka saw to his surprise that his horse
was not harmed.

738
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:42,260
He asked what this place was and who the ugly
creatures were.

739
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,610
He was told it was a mountain full of demons
and animal-spirits.

740
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:54,330
'They did not eat you because your soul was
too good,' said the old man.

741
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:58,320
'It was your soul that saved you.

742
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:04,320
Follow me and I will show you the way out
of here.'

743
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:11,410
The old man led him out of that place; then,
as Tripitaka turned to thank him, the old

744
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:16,430
man flew up into the sky on a great white
bird.

745
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:24,620
A piece of paper blew down, and on it was
written, 'I was sent by the Gods to protect

746
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,920
you on your journey.

747
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,970
Remember, the Gods will be watching you.'

748
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:40,700
Tripitaka could only bow low in thanks before
he began his journey again.

749
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:47,380
After half a day he found himself in difficult
mountain country, moving forward slowly over

750
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,140
sharp rocks.

751
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:53,270
In front of him, two tigers waited.

752
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:59,030
Realising the danger, he looked behind him
and there he saw an insect that could kill

753
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,190
him.

754
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:05,520
On his right stood a wild animal that he had
never seen before.

755
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,960
His frightened horse went down on its knees.

756
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:16,170
As the terrible creatures all started attacking
him at once, a man appeared with a sword.

757
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,060
He took Tripitaka from his horse.

758
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:23,420
'I am a hunter who these animals know and
fear.

759
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:29,350
You and I are from the same country and you
and your horse can rest at my house until

760
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,550
tomorrow.'

761
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:37,350
On the way to his house the hunter killed
a tiger, saying, 'This is luck!

762
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:42,280
Enough meat to last you for days!'

763
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:48,060
Arriving at a mountain farm, Tripitaka was
presented to the hunter's mother, who invited

764
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,710
him to stay overnight.

765
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:56,720
But when the cooked tiger was put in front
of him he had to say that, as a priest, he

766
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,920
did not eat meat.

767
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,980
He was given rice and salad instead.

768
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,550
Then, putting his hands together, he said
a prayer.

769
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,230
The hunter was surprised.

770
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,060
'You priests are certainly strange,' he said.

771
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:18,440
'You cannot even eat without a prayer.'

772
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:25,390
After dinner the hunter led his guest to a
little house full of animal skins.

773
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:31,320
Tripitaka did not like that very much, so
his host took him instead to a field of red

774
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,800
and gold flowers.

775
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:39,380
There, animals ran to him when he called.

776
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:45,270
Tripitaka had been asked by the hunter's mother
to say prayers for her dead husband.

777
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:53,920
So scriptures were read and prayers were said
all through the next day until evening.

778
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,260
That night everyone in the family dreamed
the same dream: the hunter's father had been

779
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:07,630
allowed to leave the Lower World and was born
again as the child of a rich landowner.

780
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:15,100
This, they were sure, was a result of Tripitaka's
prayers and they all thanked him.

781
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:20,750
They wanted to give him presents of silver,
but he refused the presents and left on his

782
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,990
journey, with the hunter as his guide.

783
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:32,910
At the Mountain Between Two Countries, which
was steep and rocky, the hunter climbed quickly

784
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,800
but Tripitaka was very tired.

785
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:43,700
'This country to the East,' said the hunter,
'is our land of Tang, and to the West is the

786
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,960
country of the Tartars.

787
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,850
I cannot go into their country, so you must
continue alone.'

788
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:57,830
Feeling a great fear and hopelessness, Tripitaka
held the hunter's arm.

789
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:06,890
Suddenly, from under the mountain, a voice
cried, again and again, 'The Master has come.'

790
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:09,570
'Who is that?'

791
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,130
Tripitaka asked, fearfully.

792
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:18,080
'It is the voice of the old monkey calling
from his stone box under the mountain.

793
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:25,590
The story is that long ago, when the mountain
was called the Mountain of Metal, Wood, Water,

794
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:32,810
Fire and Earth, a magic monkey was put in
a stone box by angry gods.

795
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,470
He is certainly still alive.

796
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,630
You need not be afraid.

797
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,940
We will go down and have a look.'

798
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:46,620
As the hunter had said, there was a stone
box with a hole in it, and through the opening

799
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,520
they could see the head of a monkey.

800
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,540
'Master!

801
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,560
Master!

802
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:57,750
Free me from here and I will protect you on
your journey to the West!'

803
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,330
The hunter said, 'First, we want to know more
about you.'

804
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:06,540
'I will not tell you anything,' said Monkey.

805
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,760
'I wish to speak to the priest.'

806
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,190
'What do you want to say to me?' asked Tripitaka.

807
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:20,320
'Were you sent by the Emperor of T'ang to
fetch the Scriptures from India?'

808
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,920
'I was.'

809
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:29,580
'I am the Monkey King and five hundred years
ago I made trouble, so Buddha put me in this

810
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,750
stone box.

811
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,930
The Goddess Kuan-yin has visited me.

812
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:42,270
She said that if I protect the pilgrim on
his way to India I will be forgiven and freed.

813
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:45,710
So let me be your follower.'

814
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,470
'But how can I get you out of this stone box?'

815
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:54,590
'If you make a wish, Master, I will be out,'
said Monkey.

816
01:06:54,590 --> 01:07:01,130
'Go to the top of the mountain and there you
will see a rock with letters of gold written

817
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,850
by Buddha himself.

818
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:06,970
Lift the rock and I will be free.'

819
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,500
'How can we believe him?'

820
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,140
the hunter whispered to Tripitaka.

821
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:13,850
'It is true!

822
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,560
It is true!'

823
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,140
screamed Monkey, from inside his box.

824
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:25,440
Tripitaka and the hunter climbed up again
to the top of the mountain, and there they

825
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:32,610
saw golden light pouring from a rock which
had gold writing on it.

826
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:38,780
Tripitaka went down on his knees and said,
'If this is the wish of the Gods, I will take

827
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,610
this Monkey with me to India.

828
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,230
Take away this rock and free him.'

829
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:51,940
A warm and sweet-smelling wind blew across
the mountain and lifted the rock and Buddha's

830
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:55,760
writing up into the air.

831
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,640
Tripitaka and the hunter returned to Monkey.

832
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,740
'You can come out,' they said.

833
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:10,360
With a great noise of breaking stone, Monkey
came out of the stone box and bowed in front

834
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,980
of Tripitaka.

835
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:20,189
He cried, 'Master, I am out,' and then he
began to prepare Tripitaka's horse for the

836
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:23,429
journey.

837
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:31,229
Tripitaka thanked the hunter for his kindness
and he and Monkey continued their journey.

838
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:36,908
When Tripitaka and Monkey left the mountain,
a tiger appeared in front of them, showing

839
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:39,038
its teeth.

840
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:40,889
Monkey seemed very happy.

841
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,529
'He has come to give me his coat,' he said.

842
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:51,509
He took a needle from behind his ear and the
needle was immediately transformed into a

843
01:08:51,509 --> 01:08:53,549
cudgel.

844
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:58,500
'It is five hundred years since I last used
this weapon,' he cried.

845
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,960
Look at Monkey!

846
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:09,660
He walks forward bravely, down comes the cudgel,
and the tiger falls dead.

847
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:16,479
'Sit down,' said Monkey to Tripitaka, 'while
I take his coat.'

848
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,548
Dear Monkey!

849
01:09:20,549 --> 01:09:27,029
He took a single hair from his own tail, blew
on it, and said some magic words.

850
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:34,870
The hair became a sharp little knife, and
with this knife he cut off the tiger's skin.

851
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,279
'Now we can leave this place,' he said.

852
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:44,349
'When we reach the next house, I will make
a fine coat from the skin.'

853
01:09:44,349 --> 01:09:50,279
Monkey then explained the magic of his cudgel,
which was not only for killing tigers and

854
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:57,710
dragons, but also for making rivers go backwards
or starting storms on the sea.

855
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:02,139
But then he saw a house in some trees, where
they could spend the night.

856
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:07,280
He got down from his horse and cried, 'Open
the door!'

857
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,980
A very old man, angry at the rude command,
began to push open the door.

858
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:22,119
But seeing Monkey carrying a tiger skin and
looking like a demon, he became very frightened.

859
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:27,849
Then he saw that Monkey was with a priest
and he was told that Monkey was the priest's

860
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,070
follower.

861
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:33,090
Suddenly, he recognised Monkey.

862
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:42,099
'You are the Stone Monkey in the stone box,'
said the old man in great surprise.

863
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:45,719
'How did you get out?'

864
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,360
Monkey told his story and then was asked his
age.

865
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,869
'First, how old are you?' asked Monkey.

866
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:58,400
'One hundred and thirty.'

867
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:04,260
'You are young enough to be my great-great-grandson,'
said Monkey.

868
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,940
'I was under that mountain for five hundred
years.'

869
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,820
'True,' said the old man.

870
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:20,289
'And when I was a boy, there was grass on
your head and dirt on your face.'

871
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:22,190
'Yes!' said Monkey.

872
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:29,150
'I do not wish to make trouble, but it is
five hundred years since I last washed.

873
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,989
Could you let us have a little hot water?'

874
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:39,949
When they had both washed, Monkey took Tripitaka's
white shirt, made himself a tiger-skin coat

875
01:11:39,949 --> 01:11:44,130
and asked, 'How do I look in these clothes?'

876
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,699
'Fine!' said Tripitaka.

877
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:48,630
'You really look like a pilgrim!'

878
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:54,280
And he let Monkey keep the shirt.

879
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,809
Many days later, the two travellers were attacked
by six men with swords.

880
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:04,489
The men demanded their horses and everything
they had with them.

881
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:06,489
'You are just thieves!'

882
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,690
cried Monkey.

883
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:14,790
'If you give me one seventh of everything
you have ever stolen, I will let you live.'

884
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:20,179
Angrily, they all hit Monkey on the head,
again and again.

885
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:25,090
Monkey said, 'Let me know when you are tired
and I will take out my needle.'

886
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:32,179
Of course the needle from behind Monkey's
ear transformed itself into a cudgel, and

887
01:12:32,179 --> 01:12:35,550
soon he had killed all six of them.

888
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:40,050
He returned, crying, 'Master, we can start
now.

889
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:44,090
I have killed them all.'

890
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,119
'You should never kill,' said Tripitaka, sadly.

891
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:48,619
'But I had to!

892
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:52,600
They were going to kill you!'

893
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,850
'It is better for a priest to die than to
kill others.'

894
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:01,940
'Well, I can tell you that I have killed quite
a lot of people.

895
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:06,940
And I am still the great Monkey King!' answered
Monkey.

896
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:14,400
'Your bad behaviour in Heaven caused you to
live in a stone box for five hundred years,'

897
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,820
said Tripitaka.

898
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:22,860
'If you hope to come with me to India, you
will need to change your ways.'

899
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,400
Monkey was very angry that Tripitaka had spoken
to him like that.

900
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,889
'Master,' he shouted, 'I am leaving.'

901
01:13:32,889 --> 01:13:42,020
Tripitaka said nothing, so Monkey leapt up,
ran away and was soon out of Tripitaka's sight.

902
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:47,320
Tripitaka thought, 'It is no use trying to
teach people who are like that.'

903
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,619
So, putting all the luggage on the horse's
back, he left alone and on foot.

904
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:58,480
The young priest had not gone far when he
met an old woman carrying a cap.

905
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,520
She asked him why he was travelling alone
without a follower to help him.

906
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,079
'I had a follower, but he behaved badly.

907
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,810
When I told him that, he ran away.'

908
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,559
'That is unfortunate,' she said.

909
01:14:14,559 --> 01:14:19,090
'This cap belonged to my son, who died.

910
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:23,480
I can gladly give it to your follower if he
would like it.'

911
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,809
'He ran away to the East,' said Tripitaka.

912
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:32,800
'Then he will certainly go to my house and
I shall send him back.

913
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,320
If you want him to return, you will need a
spell.'

914
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,500
She told him the words.

915
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,110
'You must make him wear this cap.

916
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:50,369
When he disobeys, say the words of the spell
and he will give you no more trouble.'

917
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:58,659
The old woman transformed herself into a golden
light and disappeared towards the East.

918
01:14:58,659 --> 01:15:03,940
Tripitaka knew then that she was really the
Goddess Kuan-yin.

919
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:09,429
Monkey had jumped on to a cloud and was returning
to his cave in the Mountain of Flowers and

920
01:15:09,429 --> 01:15:10,429
Fruit.

921
01:15:10,429 --> 01:15:15,170
On the way, he decided to drink tea with the
Dragon King.

922
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:21,019
When Monkey had told his story, the Dragon
King told him about the value of patience.

923
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:30,909
'Monkey King, it is necessary to control yourself
if you do not want to spoil all your chances.'

924
01:15:30,909 --> 01:15:33,670
Monkey thought about that and then jumped
up.

925
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,420
'Don't say another word!' he said.

926
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:41,159
'I will return to my Master at once.'

927
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:47,159
'Master,' said Monkey, when he found Tripitaka
sitting sadly by the side of the road, 'what

928
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:50,409
are you doing, still sitting here?'

929
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:53,199
'Waiting for you,' he answered.

930
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,230
'I could not continue alone.'

931
01:15:55,230 --> 01:16:00,409
'I only went to drink tea with the Dragon
King,' said Monkey.

932
01:16:00,409 --> 01:16:07,960
'If that is true, you should think about my
thirst and my hunger too.'

933
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,630
Monkey went to their luggage to look for food
and found the gift of the cap.

934
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:20,429
'If a person wears that cap,' said Tripitaka,
'they can recite the Scriptures without learning

935
01:16:20,429 --> 01:16:21,590
them first.'

936
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:23,349
'Let me put it on!'

937
01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:24,570
cried Monkey.

938
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:27,329
'Yes, put it on.'

939
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:34,469
As Monkey put it on, Tripitaka pretended to
eat some dried fruit, but he was really reciting

940
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:36,539
the magic spell.

941
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:40,469
'My head is hurting!'

942
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:42,409
screamed Monkey.

943
01:16:42,409 --> 01:16:48,980
Monkey fell on the ground, trying to take
the cap off, but a metal ring inside the cap

944
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:53,099
was getting tighter and tighter.

945
01:16:53,099 --> 01:16:58,380
Tripitaka stopped reciting the spell because
he was afraid that Monkey would break the

946
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,530
metal ring.

947
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:05,969
The pain in Monkey's head disappeared, but
the cap was still tightly there.

948
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:10,540
'You have put a spell on me,' cried Monkey.

949
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,929
'Yes,' said Tripitaka.

950
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:17,670
'It is called the Scripture of the Tight Cap.

951
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,449
Will you make trouble again?'

952
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:20,449
'Never!

953
01:17:20,449 --> 01:17:26,290
I promise,' answered Monkey, but in his heart
he was very angry.

954
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:29,940
He ran at Tripitaka with his cudgel.

955
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:36,159
Quickly, the priest again recited the words
of the spell, and Monkey fell to the ground

956
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,159
screaming.

957
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:39,679
The cudgel dropped from his hand.

958
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,650
'Were you going to hit me?'

959
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:43,650
Tripitaka asked.

960
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:45,179
'Hit you?

961
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:47,010
I dare not!'

962
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,420
cried Monkey.

963
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:54,539
Tripitaka stopped reciting because he did
not like to see Monkey suffering such terrible

964
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,539
pain.

965
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:59,409
'Who taught you this trick?'

966
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:01,670
Monkey asked when the pain stopped.

967
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:04,560
'An old woman who I met recently.'

968
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,400
'Then it was the Goddess Kuan-yin.

969
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,800
I will go to the Southern Ocean and hit her
with my cudgel!'

970
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:20,260
'As she taught me this spell, she can surely
use it herself,' said Tripitaka.

971
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,150
Monkey sat up, holding his head, which still
hurt him.

972
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,010
'I am very sorry,' he said.

973
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:31,030
'I will travel to India and never leave you.

974
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:34,369
I will protect you until the end.'

975
01:18:34,369 --> 01:18:41,699
Unable to defend himself, Monkey put the luggage
together, and they started off again towards

976
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:45,349
the West.

977
01:18:45,349 --> 01:18:51,949
CHAPTER THREE
Tripitaka Finds New Followers

978
01:18:51,949 --> 01:18:54,969
With her magic breath she shouted 'Change!'

979
01:18:54,969 --> 01:19:02,170
She transformed the Dragon into the horse
that he had just eaten.

980
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:07,420
It was the middle of winter and a cold wind
was blowing from the North.

981
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,420
There was ice everywhere and deep snow was
lying on the ground.

982
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:18,659
But the brave priest, his follower and the
white horse continued their journey across

983
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:21,099
the mountains.

984
01:19:21,099 --> 01:19:27,690
They were looking down at a river when suddenly
a dragon appeared in it and then climbed slowly

985
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,059
out of the water.

986
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:35,969
While Monkey and Tripitaka ran and hid, the
Dragon, moving along at speed and without

987
01:19:35,969 --> 01:19:41,429
stopping, opened its mouth and ate the horse.

988
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:46,929
Monkey left Tripitaka sitting on a rock and
went back to get the horse and luggage, but

989
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:49,330
he could not find the horse.

990
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:53,739
He took the luggage to the place where he
had left Tripitaka.

991
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:58,949
'The Dragon is gone,' said Monkey, 'and the
horse is too.

992
01:19:58,949 --> 01:20:01,880
It probably ran away because it was frightened.'

993
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,650
'How are we going to find it?' asked Tripitaka.

994
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:11,010
'Wait here and I will have a look,' said Monkey.

995
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:16,340
Monkey leapt into the sky and looked for it
with his bright red eyes.

996
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,710
'I cannot see it anywhere,' he told Tripitaka.

997
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:23,429
'I think the Dragon ate it.'

998
01:20:23,429 --> 01:20:26,590
'How can I travel if it has been eaten?

999
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:30,860
It is much too far to walk,' cried Tripitaka.

1000
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:36,130
Poor Tripitaka was so sad that he could not
stop crying.

1001
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:44,159
Monkey, who hated that kind of attitude, shouted
at Tripitaka, 'You look like a fool, sitting

1002
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,440
there crying!

1003
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,309
Wait there while I go after the Dragon.'

1004
01:20:49,309 --> 01:20:55,199
'You cannot do anything to the Dragon if he
is in the water,' said the young priest, still

1005
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,199
crying.

1006
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:59,150
'And next time he will eat me!

1007
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,610
'You are hopeless!

1008
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:02,770
Hopeless!'

1009
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:05,139
shouted Monkey, angrier than ever.

1010
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:10,699
'Do you want to sit there staring at the luggage
forever?'

1011
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:16,460
He was still shouting angrily when the voices
of Gods were heard in the sky.

1012
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,960
'Monkey, don't be angry.

1013
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,420
Priest, don't cry.

1014
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:27,119
We are here to protect you,' they said.

1015
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:32,260
'Then you had better stay here and look after
the Master,' said Monkey.

1016
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,910
'I am going to find that horse!

1017
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:37,449
Don't worry about me!'

1018
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:42,360
Tripitaka, feeling better, asked Monkey to
be careful.

1019
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,619
Dear Monkey!

1020
01:21:44,619 --> 01:21:50,809
He pulled his tiger-skin coat around his body,
picked up his cudgel and walked down to the

1021
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:51,809
river.

1022
01:21:51,809 --> 01:21:57,860
'You demon fish, return my horse to me,' he
called into the water.

1023
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:02,420
The Dragon leapt out of the river.

1024
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,630
'Who is making all that noise?'

1025
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,739
it shouted, angrily.

1026
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:12,540
'Come and fight,' shouted Monkey, as he waved
his cudgel.

1027
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,520
'And give me back my horse!'

1028
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,530
Monkey hit the Dragon's head with his cudgel.

1029
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,219
The Dragon came forwards with his mouth wide
open.

1030
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:26,820
It was a long and brave fight.

1031
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:33,190
They fought backwards and forwards, round
and round, and up and down until the Dragon

1032
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:35,510
began to feel weak.

1033
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:41,420
With a quick turn of his long tail, he disappeared
back into the river.

1034
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:47,400
Monkey shouted for him to come back and fight,
but the Dragon did not listen.

1035
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,659
Monkey decided to go back and tell Tripitaka.

1036
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:57,110
When Monkey returned, Tripitaka said something
that Monkey did not like.

1037
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:05,310
'The other day, after you fought the tiger,
you said you could also kill dragons.

1038
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:10,329
I do not understand why you are having such
difficulties with this dragon.'

1039
01:23:10,329 --> 01:23:12,290
'Not another word!' he cried.

1040
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:16,360
'I will soon show you who is master!'

1041
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:22,739
Annoyed, Monkey went back to the river and
used his magic to make a storm.

1042
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:28,050
The Dragon leapt up and shouted, 'What sort
of creature are you?

1043
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,480
Where do you come from?'

1044
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,270
'That is not your business - just return my
horse!'

1045
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,860
'How can I?

1046
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:39,780
Your horse is inside me.

1047
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:43,320
And if I do not, what will you do to me?'

1048
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,440
'Look at this cudgel,' said Monkey.

1049
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:53,690
'If you do not give me back the horse, you
will pay for it with your life.'

1050
01:23:53,690 --> 01:24:01,030
Again they fought, and then the Dragon transformed
himself into an insect and disappeared into

1051
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,320
the long grass.

1052
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:09,760
Beating the grass with his cudgel, Monkey
danced around wildly, trying to find him.

1053
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,889
But it was impossible.

1054
01:24:11,889 --> 01:24:16,909
So Monkey returned to Tripitaka, who was feeling
quite sorry for himself.

1055
01:24:16,909 --> 01:24:25,300
'I will be dead from cold or hunger before
we get across this river,' said Tripitaka.

1056
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:32,050
Monkey danced and jumped and leapt in anger,
but finally he had to ask the Goddess Kuan-yin

1057
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:33,909
for help.

1058
01:24:33,909 --> 01:24:37,070
When he saw her, he became angry again.

1059
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:41,460
'You told me to look after this priest,' shouted
Monkey.

1060
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,940
'So why did you give him a cap that I cannot
take off my head?

1061
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:51,519
It gives me terrible pains when he says the
words of the spell!'

1062
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,140
The Goddess laughed.

1063
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:59,030
'Because you are so full of tricks, there
is no other way to control you.'

1064
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,230
'But what about this dragon?

1065
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:03,520
That is your work too.

1066
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,370
Why did you let him eat my Master's horse?

1067
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:09,340
You should be ashamed of yourself!'

1068
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:16,550
'That dragon,' said the Goddess Kuan-yin,
'behaved badly in Heaven.

1069
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:22,429
If he carries the priest of the Emperor T'ang
on his journey to India, he will be forgiven

1070
01:25:22,429 --> 01:25:24,199
and he knows this.

1071
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:28,300
No ordinary Chinese horse could possibly do
it.

1072
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,110
I cannot understand why he ate the horse.

1073
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:36,230
I will go with you and find out.'

1074
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:43,480
She got down from her seat inside her cave
and rode on a magic light to find the Dragon.

1075
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,909
When the Dragon saw Kuan-yin, he changed into
a human.

1076
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:51,949
'Did you know that this is Tripitaka's follower?'

1077
01:25:51,949 --> 01:25:53,469
asked Kuan-yin.

1078
01:25:53,469 --> 01:25:55,199
'How could I?

1079
01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:01,749
I asked him what kind of creature he was and
he shouted at me, "That is not your business."

1080
01:26:01,749 --> 01:26:05,349
I ate his horse because I was hungry.

1081
01:26:05,349 --> 01:26:08,909
He never said anything about looking for Scriptures.

1082
01:26:08,909 --> 01:26:13,239
He never once used the word "T'ang".'

1083
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:20,020
'Monkey is fonder of showing others his own
powers than explaining anything,' said Kuan-yin.

1084
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:27,300
'But in future, if anyone questions him, he
must say that he is looking for Scriptures.

1085
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:29,030
Then there will be no more trouble.'

1086
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:35,710
The Goddess went to the Dragon and put some
drops of sweet water on him.

1087
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:40,849
Then with her magic breath she shouted 'Change!'

1088
01:26:40,849 --> 01:26:45,900
She transformed the Dragon into the horse
that he had just eaten.

1089
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:51,610
She told the Dragon to change his bad behaviour
and to promise never to go back to his old

1090
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,060
ways.

1091
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:59,590
'If you keep this promise, you will be given
a golden body,' she told him, 'and you will

1092
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,119
be given wisdom.'

1093
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:05,019
The Dragon said, 'Thank you.

1094
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:06,369
I will keep this promise.'

1095
01:27:06,369 --> 01:27:14,260
Then the Goddess turned to go, but Monkey
held her arm saying, 'That is not good enough!

1096
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:19,639
How can I help a priest to travel over these
mountains with only a horse?

1097
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:22,999
I cannot continue this journey.'

1098
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:26,920
'That is strange,' said the Goddess.

1099
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,980
'You always used to be brave, if nothing else.

1100
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,800
But there is one more power I can give you.'

1101
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,550
She took three leaves from a tree and dropped
them on Monkey's back, where they immediately

1102
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,909
became magic hairs.

1103
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:49,460
'These,' she said, 'will get you out of any
trouble.'

1104
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:50,869
Monkey thanked her.

1105
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:54,679
Then he took the horse and led him to Tripitaka.

1106
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:59,119
'This horse is in much better condition than
the old one.

1107
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:03,280
How did you manage to find it?' asked Tripitaka.

1108
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:10,289
Monkey answered, 'Kuan-yin changed the Dragon
into the horse that he had eaten.'

1109
01:28:10,289 --> 01:28:16,690
Tripitaka wanted to say 'thank you' to Kuan-yin,
but Monkey said that she was already far away.

1110
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:20,520
So Tripitaka bowed towards the South.

1111
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,639
Then he helped Monkey to prepare their luggage.

1112
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:29,199
'We still need a boat to cross this river,'
said the priest.

1113
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:34,539
'Just sit on the horse and he will carry you
across,' Monkey replied.

1114
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:38,880
But then an old fisherman in a strange boat
appeared.

1115
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,090
Monkey waved to him.

1116
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:44,840
'We have come from the East to fetch scriptures.

1117
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,489
My Master does not know how to get across
the river.

1118
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,159
Could you take him?

1119
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:56,199
The old fisherman took them all across the
river, without asking for payment.

1120
01:28:56,199 --> 01:29:00,460
'Do you know who that fisherman was?' said
Monkey.

1121
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:07,239
'He is the God of the River and he did not
help us in our fight against the Dragon.

1122
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:09,809
He knew he had done wrong.

1123
01:29:09,809 --> 01:29:13,999
That is why he did not take any money.'

1124
01:29:13,999 --> 01:29:17,699
Tripitaka did not know how true that story
was.

1125
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:23,280
But he sat on the horse and followed Monkey
along the road to the West.

1126
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,070
One evening they saw a group of houses in
the far distance.

1127
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:35,090
'Let me go and see if it is a farm and if
it seems lucky or unlucky,' said Monkey.

1128
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:41,210
A young man in a blue jacket came out of the
farm and tried to walk past Monkey without

1129
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:42,699
a word.

1130
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:47,540
But Monkey held his arm tightly while the
young man tried to escape.

1131
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:53,380
'Now, you must not be angry,' laughed Monkey,
holding him even tighter.

1132
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:57,670
'We only want to know the name of this place.'

1133
01:29:57,670 --> 01:30:03,699
The young man, seeing that he could not get
away from Monkey, answered, 'The place is

1134
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:12,659
called Kao Farm and I am Kao Ts'ai. Old Mr
Kao has a daughter of twenty who is unmarried.

1135
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:19,030
Three years ago, a creature took her and has
lived with her here as his wife.

1136
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:24,100
Six months ago the creature locked her in
his little house, and none of the family has

1137
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,560
seen her since then.

1138
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:31,409
I am going to find someone with strong enough
magic to fight this creature.'

1139
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:34,949
'This is your lucky day,' said Monkey.

1140
01:30:34,949 --> 01:30:38,349
'Here I am, and I can help you.

1141
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:42,070
Come, lead us to the master of the house.'

1142
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:45,999
'Your words are true, I hope,' said the young
man.

1143
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:48,710
'You will get me into great trouble if you
fail.'

1144
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:52,219
'I promise,' said Monkey.

1145
01:30:52,219 --> 01:30:56,119
'Now, take us in.'

1146
01:30:56,119 --> 01:31:01,699
Seeing the young man returning, old Mr Kao
shouted, 'You fool!'

1147
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:07,699
But he quickly became more polite when he
saw the young priest.

1148
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:13,250
Seeing Monkey, though, he said, 'It is surely
bad enough to have a dirty creature living

1149
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,860
with my daughter.

1150
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:18,190
Now another ugly creature has come to visit
me.'

1151
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:25,650
'You have lived a long time but have learned
very little wisdom,' said Monkey.

1152
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:28,599
'You should not judge people only by appearances.

1153
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:31,600
But I shall return your daughter to you.'

1154
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,580
'I do not understand.

1155
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,920
I thought you wanted a bed for the night.'

1156
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,139
'Yes, we do,' said Monkey.

1157
01:31:39,139 --> 01:31:45,530
'But I am also happy to kill any dirty creatures
for you, for something to do.'

1158
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:48,639
'We have three daughters.

1159
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:53,099
Our hope was that the youngest would marry
a farmer and work this farm.

1160
01:31:53,099 --> 01:31:58,780
Well, about three years ago, a nice-looking
young man came here and said his name was

1161
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,340
Pig.

1162
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,590
He seemed the right man for our daughter and
at first he worked hard on the farm.

1163
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:13,829
But then he started to change: his nose became
longer, his ears became bigger, he ate more

1164
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,440
and more.

1165
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,460
Finally, he turned into a pig.

1166
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,670
But that was not all.

1167
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:27,170
He could bring magic winds, he could disappear
and then appear again, he could make stones

1168
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:29,599
fly through the air.

1169
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:36,849
And now he keeps our daughter, Blue Flower,
in his little house, and for six months we

1170
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:39,429
have not known if she is alive or dead.'

1171
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:43,039
'Have no fear,' said Monkey.

1172
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:47,360
'I shall catch him tonight and return your
daughter to you.'

1173
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,020
'But do you need weapons?'

1174
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:57,220
'I have my weapon already,' said Monkey, taking
his needle from behind his ear and changing

1175
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:00,210
it into an iron cudgel.

1176
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:04,269
'I need only a nice old person to sit with
my Master and talk to him.

1177
01:33:04,269 --> 01:33:08,650
And now I will leave you!'

1178
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:15,030
Old Mr Kao led Monkey to the little house
and Monkey broke the door with one blow of

1179
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:17,190
his hand.

1180
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:23,219
Inside it was dark as the old man called,
'Number three daughter!'

1181
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:27,540
'Father, I am here.'

1182
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:32,139
Monkey looked hard with his red eyes and saw
a sad sight.

1183
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:38,579
The daughter's face was unwashed, her hair
was full of dirt and her lips were pale.

1184
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:45,929
She walked slowly forwards and fell, crying,
into her father's arms.

1185
01:33:45,929 --> 01:33:47,489
'Don't make that noise.

1186
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:51,010
But where is the creature?' asked Monkey.

1187
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:54,760
'I do not know,' said the unhappy girl.

1188
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:01,980
'He goes out early in the morning and does
not come back until late at night.'

1189
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:06,749
'Take your daughter back to the house and
stay with her,' said Monkey to Mr Kao.

1190
01:34:06,749 --> 01:34:13,800
'I shall wait here and end your troubles.'

1191
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:19,739
When the girl and her father had gone, Monkey
transformed himself into a girl who looked

1192
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:21,250
like Blue Flower.

1193
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,920
Then he waited.

1194
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:30,510
Soon stones came flying through the air and
there in front of him stood a terrible creature.

1195
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:36,030
He had short hairs on his dark skin, a long
nose and enormous ears.

1196
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:41,730
He wore a green jacket and had a spotted handkerchief
tied round his head.

1197
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:44,030
Dear Monkey!

1198
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,389
He did not say hello to the creature.

1199
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:51,820
He lay on the bed making noises like a person
who is ill.

1200
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:56,980
When the creature tried to kiss him, he pushed
it hard across the room.

1201
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:00,719
'Why are you angry with me?' asked the creature.

1202
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,710
'I am not angry.

1203
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:04,690
Get into bed.'

1204
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:10,199
The creature undressed in the dark, but could
not find his wife in the bed.

1205
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:13,829
Then he heard her crying on the far side of
the room.

1206
01:35:13,829 --> 01:35:17,920
'Oh, I am so unhappy!'

1207
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,409
'What are you complaining about?' asked the
creature.

1208
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:24,820
'Have I not kept my promises to you?

1209
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:29,749
I have worked on the farm, built walls and
dug new fields.

1210
01:35:29,749 --> 01:35:33,469
You have all the food and clothes that you
need.'

1211
01:35:33,469 --> 01:35:38,889
'That is not the problem,' said Monkey in
Blue Flower's voice.

1212
01:35:38,889 --> 01:35:44,400
'Today my parents came and shouted through
the wall that you are ugly.

1213
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,659
And nobody knows anything about you or who
you are.'

1214
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:51,920
'There is no mystery about who I am.

1215
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,729
Because I look a little like a pig, I am called
Pigsy.

1216
01:35:56,729 --> 01:35:58,829
Next time they ask, just tell them that.'

1217
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:04,599
'They are looking for a priest to send you
away,' said Monkey.

1218
01:36:04,599 --> 01:36:12,130
'In fact, old Mr Kao has called the great
Monkey King himself to help.'

1219
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:15,940
'If that is true, I am leaving this minute,'
cried the creature.

1220
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,690
'That Monkey is very powerful!'

1221
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:24,869
And getting dressed quickly, he opened the
door to leave.

1222
01:36:24,869 --> 01:36:28,889
With a magic spell, Monkey transformed himself
back again.

1223
01:36:28,889 --> 01:36:35,739
'Look around,' he cried, 'and you will see
that I am Monkey.'

1224
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:41,660
When Pigsy turned and saw Monkey, with his
sharp little teeth and big smile, his red

1225
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:49,260
eyes, flat head and hairy face, he ran like
the wind back to his cave.

1226
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,199
Monkey cried after him, 'Where are you going?

1227
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:54,590
If you go up to Heaven, I will follow you.

1228
01:36:54,590 --> 01:37:01,769
And if you go down to the deepest part of
Hell, I will follow you there too.'

1229
01:37:01,769 --> 01:37:07,199
Monkey followed the creature to his cave and
it came out waving a fork.

1230
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:13,550
They fought together all night, but at last
the creature leapt back into the cave and

1231
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:16,119
locked the door.

1232
01:37:16,119 --> 01:37:22,070
Monkey now saw the name of the cave on a rock:
it was Cloud-Ladder Cave.

1233
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:28,170
'I had better return to my Master now, because
he might want something,' Monkey thought.

1234
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:32,130
'I can always return and catch this creature.'

1235
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:38,510
And leaping from one cloud to another, he
was soon back at the farm.

1236
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:43,449
No one had slept all night, waiting for Monkey's
return.

1237
01:37:43,449 --> 01:37:46,860
Tripitaka was sitting with the old man when
Monkey arrived.

1238
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:50,960
'Master, here I am,' he said.

1239
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,869
'Did you have to go a long way to catch the
creature?' asked Tripitaka.

1240
01:37:56,869 --> 01:38:00,139
'That is no ordinary creature.

1241
01:38:00,139 --> 01:38:04,960
He used to live in Heaven, where he was in
charge of water-spirits.

1242
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,230
But he did wrong and he was sent down to Earth
as a pig-like creature.

1243
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:12,849
He still has all his magic powers.

1244
01:38:12,849 --> 01:38:20,440
I chased him to his mountain cave, where he
fetched a large fork and we fought all night.

1245
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,750
As the sun came up, he gave up the fight and
locked himself in his cave.

1246
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:31,710
I was going to beat down the door, but I knew
it was going to take some time.

1247
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:39,059
I thought Master might be getting anxious
so I wanted to report back here.'

1248
01:38:39,059 --> 01:38:46,969
'Monkey King,' said old Mr Kao, 'you have
driven him away, but he is certain to come

1249
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:48,110
back.

1250
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:53,760
If you can get him for us, you can have half
of all that is ours.'

1251
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,280
'I think you worry too much about him.

1252
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,780
He knows that he eats a lot.

1253
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:04,059
But he has also done a lot of work around
here.

1254
01:39:04,059 --> 01:39:09,160
He feels that his work easily pays for the
cost of feeding him.

1255
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:13,530
He is a god who has been sent to Earth as
a punishment.

1256
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:18,559
It seems that he has done no harm to your
daughter,' said Monkey.

1257
01:39:18,559 --> 01:39:25,340
'It is true,' said old Mr Kao, 'that he has
done her no harm.

1258
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:29,179
But it is very bad for our family name.

1259
01:39:29,179 --> 01:39:37,050
Everywhere I go, I hear, "Mr Kao has taken
a dirty creature for his daughter's husband."

1260
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:39,250
What can I say to that?'

1261
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:45,340
'Monkey,' said Tripitaka, 'do you not think
that you should return?

1262
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:51,320
Have one more fight with him and see if you
can find a way to end this difficult situation.'

1263
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,400
'Don't worry.

1264
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:57,119
I was only having a little game with him.

1265
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:01,110
This time I will catch him and bring him back
here.

1266
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:04,159
Look after my Master until I get back!'

1267
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,229
Monkey said to Mr Kao.

1268
01:40:07,229 --> 01:40:12,270
Monkey disappeared into the clouds and soon
arrived at the cave.

1269
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:18,579
This time, Pigsy was asleep in his cave when
Monkey broke the door in pieces.

1270
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:23,139
Angrily, Pigsy jumped out of bed and took
up his fork again.

1271
01:40:23,139 --> 01:40:24,809
'You dirty rat!

1272
01:40:24,809 --> 01:40:27,210
What do you think you are doing?

1273
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:30,860
It is a crime to break down someone else's
door!'

1274
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,050
shouted Pigsy.

1275
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:38,210
'I remember you now...' he said, looking more
closely at Monkey.

1276
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:42,960
'You once lived in a cave behind a Water Curtain.

1277
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,780
How did you get here?'

1278
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:47,420
'I am a priest now.

1279
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:54,190
I am going with a Chinese pilgrim called Tripitaka
to fetch scriptures from India.'

1280
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,760
The fork fell from Pigsy's hand.

1281
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,219
'Where is the pilgrim?'

1282
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,219
he said.

1283
01:41:00,219 --> 01:41:02,479
'Take me to him.'

1284
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,019
'Why do you want to see him?' asked Monkey.

1285
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:12,219
'The Goddess Kuan-yin put me here to prepare
myself for the arrival of a pilgrim who I

1286
01:41:12,219 --> 01:41:13,940
must follow.

1287
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:17,110
After doing this, I will receive wisdom.

1288
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:20,560
I have been waiting for this pilgrim for years.

1289
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:24,199
Why did you not tell me that you are his follower?

1290
01:41:24,199 --> 01:41:27,219
Why did you prefer to fight with me?'

1291
01:41:27,219 --> 01:41:31,309
'I am not so sure that your story is true.

1292
01:41:31,309 --> 01:41:36,159
If you really want to follow my Master to
India, you must promise that this story is

1293
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:37,159
true.

1294
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:41,360
Then I will take you to him.'

1295
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,519
Pigsy threw himself down on his knees and
bowed repeatedly.

1296
01:41:45,519 --> 01:41:49,920
'I promise holy Buddha, this is true - every
word.

1297
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:58,139
If it is not true, let the judges in Heaven
cut me into ten thousand pieces.'

1298
01:41:58,139 --> 01:42:04,610
'I believe you,' said Monkey, 'but give me
your fork.'

1299
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:11,710
Then Monkey took a hair, blew on it with his
magic breath, and changed it into a long thick

1300
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:12,710
string.

1301
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:20,659
He tied Pigsy's hands behind his back, took
him by the ear and pulled him along with him.

1302
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:27,309
When Monkey arrived at Mr Kao's farm with
Pigsy, everyone was very happy.

1303
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:32,630
After hearing Pigsy's story, Tripitaka told
Monkey to untie him.

1304
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:38,949
Tripitaka said some prayers and then they
sat down and ate supper together.

1305
01:42:38,949 --> 01:42:44,329
The next day, Tripitaka sat on the white horse
that had been a dragon.

1306
01:42:44,329 --> 01:42:52,249
Pigsy carried the luggage and Monkey carried
his cudgel, as they all left for the West.

1307
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:55,199
At last they came to a flat country.

1308
01:42:55,199 --> 01:43:05,940
Summer had passed and autumn had come, and
now in front of them was a great, wild river.

1309
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:10,500
Monkey leapt into the air and looked far down
into the water.

1310
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,769
'Master,' he reported, 'this will not be easy.

1311
01:43:14,769 --> 01:43:21,060
For me, it will not be difficult because I
can jump across in one leap, but for you it

1312
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:23,300
will be impossible.

1313
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:30,789
When I looked down, I saw that this river
is twelve thousand kilometres across.'

1314
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:37,050
Tripitaka was very unhappy but, looking down,
he saw a rock with some writing which said

1315
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:39,409
River of Sands.

1316
01:43:39,409 --> 01:43:42,300
Under that, in small letters, were the words:

1317
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:46,560
In the River of Sands, twelve thousand wide,

1318
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,770
In Dead Waters, fifteen thousand deep,

1319
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,791
Nothing will stay on the water -

1320
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:59,289
Even the lightest flower goes straight to
the bottom.

1321
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:04,050
As they looked, a terrible creature came towards
them through the water.

1322
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:09,360
His eyes were like bright lights, and around
his neck were nine heads.

1323
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,940
He rushed straight at the pilgrims.

1324
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:19,290
Monkey pushed Tripitaka to a safe place while
Pigsy attacked the creature with his fork.

1325
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:23,550
The creature fought hard and the fight was
a good one.

1326
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:31,260
Monkey was impatient to join in and at last,
with a wild scream, he leapt at the creature.

1327
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:37,320
As he brought his cudgel down on its head,
it disappeared into the water.

1328
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,469
Pigsy was very angry.

1329
01:44:38,469 --> 01:44:43,170
'Brother, who asked you to fight my fight?

1330
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:47,940
That creature was just getting tired and I
had almost finished him.

1331
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:50,739
You have spoilt everything.'

1332
01:44:50,739 --> 01:44:54,369
'I am sorry,' laughed Monkey.

1333
01:44:54,369 --> 01:44:56,949
'But I could not stand and watch.

1334
01:44:56,949 --> 01:45:03,760
I have not used my cudgel for months and I
got so excited that I could not stop myself.

1335
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,110
I wanted to join the fun.'

1336
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:11,690
So, hand in hand, they returned to Tripitaka.

1337
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:16,019
'It will be your turn next time,' promised
Pigsy.

1338
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:21,780
'Thank you, but I am really not at my best
in water,' said Monkey.

1339
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:27,289
'I am happier in the clouds and I have enough
tricks on land.

1340
01:45:27,289 --> 01:45:33,769
If you can make this creature leave the river,
I will come and help you.'

1341
01:45:33,769 --> 01:45:39,789
Pigsy went into the river and discovered that
he had not lost his water-magic.

1342
01:45:39,789 --> 01:45:43,250
He soon found the creature at the bottom of
the river.

1343
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:46,800
'You ugly pig,' the creature shouted.

1344
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,460
'Can you not see that I am not an ordinary
creature?

1345
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,380
I am a god.

1346
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:58,630
One day, at a banquet in Heaven, I accidentally
broke the Jade Emperor's bowl.

1347
01:45:58,630 --> 01:46:04,800
He was very angry and I was sent down here
to the River of Sands.

1348
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,999
When I am hungry, as I am now, I eat people.

1349
01:46:09,999 --> 01:46:16,900
You would taste very good if I cut you up
and put some sugar and salt on you.'

1350
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:19,530
'You will not eat me!

1351
01:46:19,530 --> 01:46:21,340
You can eat my fork!'

1352
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:28,550
So again they started fighting, and they fought
for two hours.

1353
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:33,500
After that, Pigsy pretended to be tired and
ready to stop.

1354
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:38,969
When he left the water and climbed on to the
land, the creature followed.

1355
01:46:38,969 --> 01:46:42,320
'Come on,' cried Pigsy.

1356
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:48,900
'With the hard earth under our feet, we will
have a better fight than we did before.'

1357
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:53,019
'I know what you are trying to do,' said the
creature.

1358
01:46:53,019 --> 01:46:59,570
'You are trying to get me out of the river
so your friend can help you.

1359
01:46:59,570 --> 01:47:03,880
We will go back in the water and finish the
fight there.'

1360
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:09,789
The creature refused to move, so they fought
on the water's edge.

1361
01:47:09,789 --> 01:47:12,499
Monkey was watching from a distance.

1362
01:47:12,499 --> 01:47:19,369
'Wait here,' he said to Tripitaka, 'while
I try one of my tricks.'

1363
01:47:19,369 --> 01:47:24,550
Monkey leapt into the air and jumped straight
down at the creature.

1364
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:29,860
But the creature saw him coming and ran back
into the water.

1365
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:33,749
'He is probably not going to come out again,'
Monkey said.

1366
01:47:33,749 --> 01:47:36,670
'This is difficult,' said Pigsy.

1367
01:47:36,670 --> 01:47:39,119
'What are we going to do?'

1368
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:44,409
'Let's go and see the Master,' said Monkey.

1369
01:47:44,409 --> 01:47:48,550
They told Tripitaka, who started crying loudly.

1370
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:53,429
'We will never get across,' he said sadly.

1371
01:47:53,429 --> 01:47:56,690
'Don't worry,' Monkey said.

1372
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:59,520
'It is true that we cannot get across yet.

1373
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:05,570
That creature is a terrible problem, but he
is not going to stop us.'

1374
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:09,579
'What are we going to do?' asked Pigsy.

1375
01:48:09,579 --> 01:48:15,969
'Pigsy,' said Monkey, 'stay here with the
Master while I go to the Southern Ocean to

1376
01:48:15,969 --> 01:48:18,849
find the Goddess Kuan-yin.

1377
01:48:18,849 --> 01:48:24,139
This search for the Scriptures was her idea
and she must help us now.'

1378
01:48:24,139 --> 01:48:31,760
'You had better go now,' said Tripitaka, 'and
get back here quickly.'

1379
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,840
Leaping through the clouds, Monkey reached
the Southern Ocean in no time at all.

1380
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:42,989
He found the Goddess with the Dragon King's
daughter.

1381
01:48:42,989 --> 01:48:45,280
'Why are you not looking after your Master?'

1382
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,260
she asked at once.

1383
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:54,000
'When we came to the River of Sands,' said
Monkey, 'we found a creature that we cannot

1384
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
destroy.

1385
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,250
He is a very good fighter.

1386
01:48:57,250 --> 01:49:03,550
My friend Pigsy tried hard to beat him, but
he was not successful.

1387
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:06,090
This is why I have come to you.'

1388
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:08,639
'Monkey, do you ever listen?

1389
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,709
It is the same story again and again.

1390
01:49:13,709 --> 01:49:17,420
Why did you not say that you are with the
Priest of T'ang?'

1391
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:22,880
'I suppose we were too busy trying to catch
him,' said Monkey.

1392
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,969
'I put him there.

1393
01:49:24,969 --> 01:49:30,369
I intended him to help the Master and his
pilgrims,' said Kuan-yin.

1394
01:49:30,369 --> 01:49:37,909
'You did not tell him that you were from China
and looking for the Scriptures, did you?

1395
01:49:37,909 --> 01:49:39,949
That was your mistake.

1396
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:42,699
He is there to help you, you fool!'

1397
01:49:42,699 --> 01:49:49,150
'He is sitting at the bottom of the river
and he is not happy,' said Monkey.

1398
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:51,949
'How can I make him come out and help us?

1399
01:49:51,949 --> 01:49:58,020
And how is Tripitaka going to get across the
river?'

1400
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:02,390
Kuan-yin gave a red water-bottle to her follower
Hui-yen.

1401
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:03,469
She told him,

1402
01:50:03,469 --> 01:50:07,230
'Go with Monkey to the river and shout "Sandy!"

1403
01:50:07,230 --> 01:50:11,159
The creature will come out at once.

1404
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:13,309
Take him to the Master.

1405
01:50:13,309 --> 01:50:18,900
Then put this red water-bottle in the middle
of the nine heads that he wears around his

1406
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:19,900
neck.

1407
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:23,050
A ship will be sent from the Gods.

1408
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:28,000
It will carry Tripitaka across the River of
Sands.'

1409
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,670
Hui-yen went to the river and called, 'Sandy,
Sandy!

1410
01:50:32,670 --> 01:50:39,810
Come out and meet the Master and his pilgrims.

1411
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:46,489
They are looking for the Scriptures and they
have been here for a long time.'

1412
01:50:46,489 --> 01:50:48,789
The creature came up at once.

1413
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:53,739
He bowed politely and asked, 'Where are the
pilgrims?'

1414
01:50:53,739 --> 01:51:00,480
'They are sitting over there, on the eastern
side,' replied Hui-yen.

1415
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:08,599
'Well,' said Sandy, looking at Pigsy, 'that
dirty creature never said a word about Scriptures

1416
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:12,769
and I fought with him for two whole days.'

1417
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:18,150
Then, seeing Monkey, he cried, 'Him too?

1418
01:51:18,150 --> 01:51:20,690
I am not going near them.'

1419
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:27,940
'The first is Pigsy,' said Hui-yen, 'and the
second is Monkey.

1420
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:32,849
They are both Tripitaka's followers and both
were made priests by Kuan-yin.

1421
01:51:32,849 --> 01:51:36,039
You have nothing to fear.

1422
01:51:36,039 --> 01:51:40,510
I myself will introduce you to the Master.'

1423
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:47,959
Sandy came out of the river, tidied himself
and went down on his knees in front of Tripitaka.

1424
01:51:47,959 --> 01:51:56,369
He said, 'I did not recognise you, Master,
so forgive me for being so impolite.'

1425
01:51:56,369 --> 01:52:03,309
'You rude creature,' said Pigsy, 'why did
you want to fight with us, instead of joining

1426
01:52:03,309 --> 01:52:05,329
us from the beginning?'

1427
01:52:05,329 --> 01:52:11,459
'Brother,' laughed Monkey, 'don't be angry
with him, because it is all our fault.

1428
01:52:11,459 --> 01:52:14,979
We never told him that we are going to get
the Scriptures.'

1429
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:20,659
'Do you really want to be a priest in our
religion?' asked Tripitaka.

1430
01:52:20,659 --> 01:52:26,530
Sandy said that he did, so Monkey was asked
to shave Sandy's head.

1431
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:32,570
Monkey took a knife and soon Sandy had no
hair left on his head.

1432
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:40,829
Sandy bowed many times in front of Tripitaka,
but only once in front of Monkey and Pigsy.

1433
01:52:40,829 --> 01:52:46,550
Tripitaka liked Sandy's new appearance and
he was very pleased with his new follower.

1434
01:52:46,550 --> 01:52:52,999
'You had better be quick and start your boat-building,'
said Hui-yen.

1435
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:57,929
Taking the heads from his neck, Sandy laid
them at the edge of the water in the shape

1436
01:52:57,929 --> 01:53:00,209
of a magic square.

1437
01:53:00,209 --> 01:53:02,849
He put Kuan-yin's water-bottle in the middle.

1438
01:53:02,849 --> 01:53:10,230
At once, the heads and the bottle became a
ship, sent by the Gods.

1439
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:15,239
Tripitaka came down to the water and walked
on to the holy ship.

1440
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:19,099
Pigsy supported him on the left, Sandy on
the right.

1441
01:53:19,099 --> 01:53:26,039
Monkey, behind him, held on to the white horse,
which followed as well as it could.

1442
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:33,280
They soon arrived perfectly safely at the
other side.

1443
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,190
CHAPTER FOUR
A Dead King and a Competition

1444
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:46,639
Then Manjusri said a spell, the magician returned
to his tiger shape, and the God rode him away

1445
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,610
over the clouds.

1446
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:56,449
Tripitaka sat in the Great Hall of the Wood
Temple reciting the True Scriptures.

1447
01:53:56,449 --> 01:53:59,429
It was midnight and he was tired.

1448
01:53:59,429 --> 01:54:03,170
Soon he lay across his reading desk and slept.

1449
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:06,829
Although his eyes were closed, he seemed to
know what was happening.

1450
01:54:06,829 --> 01:54:13,409
He heard a voice outside the Hall whispering
'Master.'

1451
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:15,400
Tripitaka lifted his head.

1452
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:20,999
In his dream he saw a man who was wet from
head to foot.

1453
01:54:20,999 --> 01:54:25,389
When he looked more closely, he saw that the
man was a king.

1454
01:54:25,389 --> 01:54:29,409
The King told Tripitaka his story:

1455
01:54:29,409 --> 01:54:37,429
'Five years ago, the rain stopped falling,
the grass stopped growing and all my people

1456
01:54:37,429 --> 01:54:39,360
were dying of hunger.

1457
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:44,230
I prayed to the Gods, but still the rivers
were empty.

1458
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:49,530
But then a magician came who could call the
wind and the rain.

1459
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:53,260
I asked him to pray for rain and he did.

1460
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:55,989
The rain came pouring down.

1461
01:54:55,989 --> 01:55:00,790
For the next two years I was very kind to
this magician.

1462
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:07,690
Then, in spring, when the two of us were walking
by the great water hole in my palace, I suddenly

1463
01:55:07,690 --> 01:55:12,239
saw a white light and he pushed me into the
hole.

1464
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:17,070
He covered the top of it and then made a tree
grow over it.

1465
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:18,900
Pity me!

1466
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:23,969
I have been dead for three years and nobody
knows.'

1467
01:55:23,969 --> 01:55:31,469
Tripitaka was white with fear, but at last
he said, 'Why did nobody look for you?'

1468
01:55:31,469 --> 01:55:39,159
'Ah, with his great power the magician transformed
himself into a man who looked like me.

1469
01:55:39,159 --> 01:55:42,449
Now he is the king of my people.

1470
01:55:42,449 --> 01:55:49,249
But the Night Spirit blew me to you and gave
me hope with talk of a great Monkey King who

1471
01:55:49,249 --> 01:55:52,719
can kill demons with his cudgel.'

1472
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,570
'But everybody in your country thinks that
the magician is you.

1473
01:55:57,570 --> 01:56:02,329
My follower would be attacked if he tried
to help,' said Tripitaka.

1474
01:56:02,329 --> 01:56:10,409
'I have a son, the Prince, who spends most
of his time in the Palace of Golden Bells.

1475
01:56:10,409 --> 01:56:16,730
He is not allowed to see his mother, the Queen,
because she might say something.

1476
01:56:16,730 --> 01:56:23,219
He knows nothing about his true father except
that I had this piece of white jade.'

1477
01:56:23,219 --> 01:56:30,280
'But how can a poor priest like me get to
the Palace of Golden Bells?'

1478
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:36,969
'Tomorrow my son will hunt with three thousand
followers, and when you give him the jade

1479
01:56:36,969 --> 01:56:39,760
he will know what to do.

1480
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:46,329
But now I must tell my Queen everything in
a dream.'

1481
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:52,949
As he turned to go, the dead king hit his
head on the floor and Tripitaka woke up.

1482
01:56:52,949 --> 01:56:54,979
'Followers!' he called.

1483
01:56:54,979 --> 01:56:57,190
'Where are my followers?'

1484
01:56:57,190 --> 01:57:00,469
'Now what?' said Pigsy.

1485
01:57:00,469 --> 01:57:05,830
'I was happier with my old life, although
the food was bad.

1486
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:11,719
Now I am woken up in the middle of the night
to look after a priest.'

1487
01:57:11,719 --> 01:57:18,650
'I had a strange dream,' said Tripitaka, uncertainly.

1488
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:25,650
Monkey then came in and said, 'Master, your
dreams come from your waking thoughts because

1489
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,690
you worry all the time.

1490
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:34,369
I think only of seeing Buddha in the West,
and no dream comes near me.'

1491
01:57:34,369 --> 01:57:38,829
But Tripitaka made Monkey listen to the dead
king's story.

1492
01:57:38,829 --> 01:57:41,369
'Say no more,' said Monkey.

1493
01:57:41,369 --> 01:57:44,260
'This is work for me!'

1494
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:52,039
'The King left this,' said Tripitaka, remembering,
and he gave Monkey the piece of jade.

1495
01:57:52,039 --> 01:57:54,559
Dear Monkey!

1496
01:57:54,559 --> 01:58:00,440
He pulled a hair from his tail, blew on it,
and said a magic spell.

1497
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:05,550
When a beautiful small box appeared, he put
the piece of jade in it.

1498
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:12,280
'In the early morning,' he told Tripitaka,
'read the Scriptures in the Great Hall.

1499
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:19,920
I shall transform myself into a little priest,
five centimetres high, and I shall jump into

1500
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,260
the box with the jade.

1501
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:30,329
When the Prince opens the box, I shall jump
out, show him the jade and tell him the dream.'

1502
01:58:30,329 --> 01:58:35,480
Both the follower and his teacher were too
excited to sleep that night.

1503
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:39,949
At last, the first light of morning came in
the East.

1504
01:58:39,949 --> 01:58:46,150
After giving whispered orders to Pigsy and
Sandy to wait quietly for him, Monkey leapt

1505
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:49,809
into the air and flew.

1506
01:58:49,809 --> 01:58:54,860
At once, his red eyes found a walled city
to the West.

1507
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:59,710
The sadness of its people hung in clouds over
the city.

1508
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:07,099
But as Monkey was watching this sad sight,
the gates opened and the huntsmen came out.

1509
01:59:07,099 --> 01:59:12,400
It was clear from his fine clothes which huntsman
was the Prince.

1510
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,550
'Let me play a trick on him,' said Monkey
to himself.

1511
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:20,340
Dear Monkey!

1512
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:26,849
Coming down from his cloud, he transformed
himself into a small woodland animal and ran

1513
01:59:26,849 --> 01:59:29,880
in front of the Prince's horse.

1514
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:34,269
The Prince chased it and the huntsmen followed
the Prince.

1515
01:59:34,269 --> 01:59:38,729
Soon, Monkey had led all of them to the Wood
Temple.

1516
01:59:38,729 --> 01:59:45,800
'Of course, I have known of this place,' said
the Prince, 'although I have never visited

1517
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:46,800
it.

1518
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:49,039
I will go in.'

1519
01:59:49,039 --> 01:59:54,559
As the Prince and his followers went into
the Great Hall, everybody welcomed him and

1520
01:59:54,559 --> 01:59:58,190
bowed, except Tripitaka.

1521
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:03,510
The angry Prince told his followers to take
the priest and tie him up.

1522
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:11,030
But Monkey, now five centimetres high and
in the box, told the Gods to protect Tripitaka,

1523
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:13,190
so the huntsmen could not touch him.

1524
02:00:13,190 --> 02:00:19,560
'What magic are you using,' asked the Prince,
'to protect yourself?'

1525
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:22,790
'I have no magic,' replied Tripitaka.

1526
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:29,469
'I am only a priest from China, on the way
to India to fetch the Scriptures.

1527
02:00:29,469 --> 02:00:35,590
But in this box there is someone who knows
something very important.'

1528
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:42,949
As he spoke, Tripitaka opened the box and
out leapt a very small Monkey.

1529
02:00:42,949 --> 02:00:48,829
The Prince laughed and said, 'What can that
little creature know!'

1530
02:00:48,829 --> 02:00:55,849
But Monkey, to the great surprise of everybody,
used his magic to return to his full size.

1531
02:00:55,849 --> 02:01:00,010
'Prince,' he said, 'please listen to me.

1532
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:07,130
Five years ago your country had no food because
no rain fell, but then a magician came and

1533
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,840
he brought rain.

1534
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,030
Is this true?'

1535
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:12,110
'Yes, yes, yes.

1536
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:13,499
Go on!'

1537
02:01:13,499 --> 02:01:15,979
'And what happened to the magician?'

1538
02:01:15,979 --> 02:01:23,040
'Three years ago, when he and my father were
walking in the garden, a magic wind blew a

1539
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:30,260
piece of jade out of the King's hand and the
magician went back to his mountains with it.

1540
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:38,060
But the King, my father, still misses the
magician and he has locked the garden.'

1541
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:43,999
Monkey laughed, but he asked the huntsmen
to move away so he could speak privately to

1542
02:01:43,999 --> 02:01:45,380
the Prince.

1543
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:49,360
'Sir, it was your father who disappeared.

1544
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,949
The man in the palace is the magician who
brought rain.'

1545
02:01:52,949 --> 02:01:57,250
'That is not true!' said the Prince.

1546
02:01:57,250 --> 02:02:00,260
'Here is the piece of jade,' said Monkey.

1547
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,739
'You stole the jade!'

1548
02:02:02,739 --> 02:02:05,170
shouted the Prince to the priest.

1549
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:07,869
'Take him away!'

1550
02:02:07,869 --> 02:02:12,719
Tripitaka shouted fearfully to Monkey, 'Oh
Monkey, you fool.

1551
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,059
What have you done?'

1552
02:02:15,059 --> 02:02:16,809
'Wait!' cried Monkey.

1553
02:02:16,809 --> 02:02:22,530
'I am the Monkey King and a follower of Tripitaka.

1554
02:02:22,530 --> 02:02:28,019
Last night in this temple your father came
to my Master in a dream.

1555
02:02:28,019 --> 02:02:33,340
He told him that the magician had pushed him
into a great water hole in the palace and

1556
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:36,260
changed into a man who looked like him.

1557
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:39,760
He could then pretend to be the king.

1558
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:45,780
I changed into a hunted animal to lead you
here because I wanted to tell you this.

1559
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:49,630
Will you believe my story or not?'

1560
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:53,269
The young Prince did not know what to believe.

1561
02:02:53,269 --> 02:02:57,199
'Ride home,' suggested Monkey.

1562
02:02:57,199 --> 02:03:03,480
'Take this piece of jade with you and ask
your mother, the Queen, if the present king

1563
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:05,010
is her husband.'

1564
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:10,840
The young Prince agreed and went back to the
palace.

1565
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:16,829
He found his mother, the Queen, still worried
about a dream she had had the night before.

1566
02:03:16,829 --> 02:03:23,360
'Mother,' said the Prince, 'forgive my words
before I speak them.

1567
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:30,000
Compare your life with my father in the last
three years with the years before that, and

1568
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,369
tell me if his love is as warm today.'

1569
02:03:34,369 --> 02:03:38,440
In answer the Queen recited:

1570
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:43,630
'Three years ago something warm and kind.

1571
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:46,989
These last three years has been as cold as
ice.'

1572
02:03:46,989 --> 02:03:53,739
The Prince told his mother everything that
he had heard that day.

1573
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:57,010
Then he showed her the piece of jade.

1574
02:03:57,010 --> 02:04:06,159
'Oh, my son,' said the Queen, 'when you came
I was crying because of a dream I had last

1575
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:07,159
night.

1576
02:04:07,159 --> 02:04:09,699
I dreamt I saw your father.

1577
02:04:09,699 --> 02:04:12,599
His head was under water and he was dead.

1578
02:04:12,599 --> 02:04:19,570
But his soul had visited a priest of T'ang
and asked him to destroy the magician.

1579
02:04:19,570 --> 02:04:25,309
He also asked him to save his own body from
where it had been thrown.

1580
02:04:25,309 --> 02:04:29,869
Go quickly and ask that priest to help us.'

1581
02:04:29,869 --> 02:04:37,920
The young prince ran out, jumped on his horse,
rode back to the Wood Temple and asked the

1582
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:40,920
pilgrims to find his father.

1583
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:46,729
So the next night Monkey and Pigsy were at
the gates of the locked Flower Garden.

1584
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:51,959
But Monkey had told Pigsy that there was gold
at the bottom of the water hole.

1585
02:04:51,959 --> 02:04:56,519
He had said nothing about the dead king.

1586
02:04:56,519 --> 02:05:01,530
Pigsy brought his fork down on the lock of
the gates and broke it.

1587
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:07,159
Inside the garden, Monkey could not stop himself
jumping and shouting happily.

1588
02:05:07,159 --> 02:05:12,699
'Brother,' said Pigsy, 'you will ruin us,
making all that noise!'

1589
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:19,380
'Why are you trying to make me nervous?' said
Monkey.

1590
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:24,439
They found the tree that the magician had
planted on top of the hole.

1591
02:05:24,439 --> 02:05:31,030
'Now, Pigsy, the gold is hidden under this
tree,' said Monkey.

1592
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:37,599
At once, the fool Pigsy hit the tree with
his fork until it fell down.

1593
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:44,999
Then he used his nose to dig under it until,
about a metre down, he found a big stone.

1594
02:05:44,999 --> 02:05:47,219
'Brother!' he cried.

1595
02:05:47,219 --> 02:05:49,459
'This is luck.

1596
02:05:49,459 --> 02:05:53,170
The gold will be under this.'

1597
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:57,219
Pigsy used his nose again and lifted the big
stone.

1598
02:05:57,219 --> 02:05:59,969
Below it something was shining.

1599
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:03,070
'That is the gold!'

1600
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:04,800
cried Pigsy.

1601
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:12,420
But looking closer, they saw it was the light
of the stars and the moon in the water.

1602
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:19,889
Monkey made his cudgel grow until it was ten
metres long, and Pigsy climbed down it.

1603
02:06:19,889 --> 02:06:23,980
When he was in the water, he began to swim.

1604
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:28,939
Monkey called down to him, 'The gold is at
the bottom.'

1605
02:06:28,939 --> 02:06:36,559
So Pigsy dived down and, opening his eyes
again, saw a door with a sign on it that said

1606
02:06:36,559 --> 02:06:41,389
The Palace at the Bottom of the Water Hole.

1607
02:06:41,389 --> 02:06:48,939
Pigsy went in and a servant called out, 'Great
King, something awful has happened - a priest

1608
02:06:48,939 --> 02:06:52,570
with a long nose has come in.

1609
02:06:52,570 --> 02:06:56,060
The Dragon King of the Water Hole was not
surprised.

1610
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:59,249
'That must be Pigsy,' he explained.

1611
02:06:59,249 --> 02:07:04,789
'He has come with the Monkey King to find
the dishonest magician.

1612
02:07:04,789 --> 02:07:10,650
Please come in and sit down,' he called to
Pigsy.

1613
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:19,610
Pigsy, happy and wet, sat in the best seat
and asked, 'Where is the gold?'

1614
02:07:19,610 --> 02:07:26,499
'I am sorry,' said the Dragon King, 'but I
live down here in this hole and never see

1615
02:07:26,499 --> 02:07:29,030
the sky above.

1616
02:07:29,030 --> 02:07:31,619
Where would I get gold from?'

1617
02:07:31,619 --> 02:07:34,719
'Oh, please!' said Pigsy.

1618
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:40,619
'I know it is here somewhere, so you had better
bring it out.'

1619
02:07:40,619 --> 02:07:44,639
'I have one thing that is of value.

1620
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:47,599
You can look,' said the Dragon King.

1621
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:52,360
He led Pigsy to the body of the dead king.

1622
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,190
Pigsy went back up to Monkey.

1623
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:59,070
Monkey told him that the body was better than
gold.

1624
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:04,719
So Pigsy dived back down again and brought
the body up.

1625
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:09,219
Monkey looked closely at the body, which had
been dead for three years.

1626
02:08:09,219 --> 02:08:16,690
He asked Pigsy, 'After three years, how can
it still look so fresh?'

1627
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:24,369
'The Dragon King used a magic stone to keep
it like that,' Pigsy answered.

1628
02:08:24,369 --> 02:08:27,600
'That was a bit of luck,' said Monkey.

1629
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:33,820
'But we must still get his enemy and make
him pay for this terrible murder.

1630
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:36,429
And we will be thanked for our good work.

1631
02:08:36,429 --> 02:08:40,570
Quickly, Pigsy, carry the King away.'

1632
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:43,809
'Where to?' asked Pigsy.

1633
02:08:43,809 --> 02:08:49,409
'To the temple,' said Monkey, 'to show him
to Tripitaka.'

1634
02:08:49,409 --> 02:08:52,409
'What an idea!'

1635
02:08:52,409 --> 02:08:54,090
Pigsy complained to himself.

1636
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:57,880
'I was tricked into doing this job.

1637
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,099
I do not want to carry this dead body.'

1638
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:05,979
'Hurry, Pigsy,' said Monkey impatiently.

1639
02:09:05,979 --> 02:09:11,540
'I am not going to carry it,' said Pigsy.

1640
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:18,429
'If you do not want to be beaten, you will
carry it away now,' said Monkey.

1641
02:09:18,429 --> 02:09:24,289
Pigsy feared the cudgel, so he lifted up the
dead body and put it on his back.

1642
02:09:24,289 --> 02:09:32,800
'This Monkey,' he said to himself, 'has played
a dirty trick on me, but he will be sorry.

1643
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:39,809
When we get back to the temple, I will tell
Tripitaka that Monkey can bring the dead to

1644
02:09:39,809 --> 02:09:41,739
life.

1645
02:09:41,739 --> 02:09:44,739
Monkey will say that he cannot.

1646
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:50,099
And I will tell Tripitaka to recite the spell.

1647
02:09:50,099 --> 02:09:59,130
Monkey's head will hurt, but I will not be
happy until his brains shoot out of his head.'

1648
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:05,369
They took the body back to the temple and
showed it to Tripitaka.

1649
02:10:05,369 --> 02:10:08,640
He told Monkey to bring it back to life.

1650
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:13,570
'Only Yama, King of Death, can do that,' said
Monkey.

1651
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:16,150
'Don't believe him!'

1652
02:10:16,150 --> 02:10:17,719
cried Pigsy.

1653
02:10:17,719 --> 02:10:21,670
'Just tighten that cap on his head.'

1654
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:23,909
Poor Monkey!

1655
02:10:23,909 --> 02:10:30,270
He was soon holding his head in great pain
as Tripitaka recited the spell.

1656
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:33,670
The cap became tighter and tighter.

1657
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:38,880
'But Master,' said Monkey, 'what will happen
if I fail?'

1658
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:46,110
'If someone puts a good breath into him, he
will be himself again, even after three years

1659
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:51,429
under water,' said Tripitaka.

1660
02:10:51,429 --> 02:10:57,110
Pigsy at once offered his breath, but Tripitaka
knew that it was not pure.

1661
02:10:57,110 --> 02:11:00,889
Pigsy had eaten the bodies of humans.

1662
02:11:00,889 --> 02:11:07,739
So he asked for Monkey, whose food had been
only apples and food from the forest.

1663
02:11:07,739 --> 02:11:14,289
Monkey blew hard into the King's mouth and
his soul returned.

1664
02:11:14,289 --> 02:11:19,010
Then they all went back to the city to find
the magician who had taken the appearance

1665
02:11:19,010 --> 02:11:21,449
of the King.

1666
02:11:21,449 --> 02:11:25,449
When they were led to him, they refused to
bow.

1667
02:11:25,449 --> 02:11:30,750
'And who are you?' asked the false king, surprised.

1668
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:38,939
'My Master,' said Monkey, 'is called Tripitaka
and he is like a younger brother to the Emperor

1669
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:40,139
of China.

1670
02:11:40,139 --> 02:11:44,579
I am his main follower.'

1671
02:11:44,579 --> 02:11:51,229
Then he told the false king about Pigsy and
Sandy, but he introduced the true king as

1672
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:53,349
a temple servant.

1673
02:11:53,349 --> 02:11:59,209
The false king wanted to know more about this
'temple servant'.

1674
02:11:59,209 --> 02:12:05,619
He looked at the true king, who was afraid
of him, but Monkey whispered, 'It is all right!

1675
02:12:05,619 --> 02:12:08,079
I will speak for you.'

1676
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:10,440
Dear Monkey!

1677
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:15,389
He stepped forwards and cried to the magician
in a loud, clear voice.

1678
02:12:15,389 --> 02:12:22,050
'Oh, King, this old man has had some hard
times in his life.

1679
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:30,050
Five years ago, disaster came to his family
when Heaven sent no rain and people died because

1680
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:32,250
there was no water.

1681
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:37,210
Then from the mountains came a magician who
helped the people.

1682
02:12:37,210 --> 02:12:41,340
But he then destroyed this man's life.

1683
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:48,840
He pushed him into a great water hole in the
palace and became a false king of the people.

1684
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:59,119
But I have returned life to the dead man and
he should be king again - not this magician.'

1685
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:03,459
The magician felt fear deep in his heart.

1686
02:13:03,459 --> 02:13:08,619
Taking a sword from a soldier, he jumped on
a cloud and disappeared.

1687
02:13:08,619 --> 02:13:12,389
Both Sandy and Pigsy were very angry.

1688
02:13:12,389 --> 02:13:18,329
'Now we will never be able to find him,' they
shouted.

1689
02:13:18,329 --> 02:13:20,010
Dear Monkey!

1690
02:13:20,010 --> 02:13:27,080
Telling Pigsy and Sandy to take good care
of the Prince, the King, his ministers, the

1691
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:31,719
Queen and Tripitaka, he suddenly leapt into
the clouds.

1692
02:13:31,719 --> 02:13:37,110
Looking down, he saw the magician running
to the North-east.

1693
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:41,159
He shouted, 'Where do you think you are going?

1694
02:13:41,159 --> 02:13:42,429
Monkey has come!'

1695
02:13:42,429 --> 02:13:49,030
'Keep out of my way,' shouted the magician.

1696
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:55,749
Monkey fought a terrible fight with his cudgel
against the magician and his sword, but suddenly

1697
02:13:55,749 --> 02:13:59,360
the magician escaped back to the city.

1698
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:04,679
He transformed himself into someone who looked
like Tripitaka.

1699
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:09,479
Monkey followed him but did not dare use his
cudgel.

1700
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:14,860
'Which is the real Tripitaka?' he shouted
to Pigsy and Sandy.

1701
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:18,469
'We do not know,' they answered.

1702
02:14:18,469 --> 02:14:22,150
'We have no idea.'

1703
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:27,159
'Master, recite your spell,' called Monkey.

1704
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:30,750
The real Tripitaka at once recited.

1705
02:14:30,750 --> 02:14:35,059
Pigsy lifted up his fork as the magician flew
up into the air.

1706
02:14:35,059 --> 02:14:36,689
Dear Pigsy!

1707
02:14:36,689 --> 02:14:41,940
He chased the magician, with Sandy and Monkey
close behind him.

1708
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:50,479
What a fight there was then, with three wild
priests hitting and kicking at one terrible

1709
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:54,140
ugly creature again and again.

1710
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:59,889
In the end, Monkey leapt above the creature,
and he was going to cut him in half with his

1711
02:14:59,889 --> 02:15:07,400
cudgel when a voice said, 'Monkey, stop the
fight.'

1712
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:09,360
It was the God Manjusri.

1713
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:17,039
He had come down from Heaven with a magic
mirror which showed demons in their true form.

1714
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:20,750
'But I do not understand,' said Monkey.

1715
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:25,420
'In this mirror, the magician is a tiger.'

1716
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:27,829
'Yes,' said Manjusri.

1717
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:33,570
'As a magician, he was acting under Buddha's
orders.'

1718
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:34,659
'What!'

1719
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:35,659
cried Monkey.

1720
02:15:35,659 --> 02:15:39,039
'The magician is protected by Buddha!

1721
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:42,309
How can that be?'

1722
02:15:42,309 --> 02:15:45,989
'Let me explain,' said Manjusri.

1723
02:15:45,989 --> 02:15:53,630
'In the beginning, the true king pleased Buddha
so much that he sent me to fetch him to the

1724
02:15:53,630 --> 02:15:55,219
Western Heaven.

1725
02:15:55,219 --> 02:15:59,380
But I said something to the King that offended
him.

1726
02:15:59,380 --> 02:16:03,570
He told his soldiers to throw me into the
river.

1727
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:09,850
Then Buddha sent this magician to throw the
King into the water hole for three years.

1728
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:15,739
But now, with your help, he has been forgiven.'

1729
02:16:15,739 --> 02:16:20,030
'Yes, but the people of the city?' asked Monkey.

1730
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:22,780
'Nothing has happened to them.

1731
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:28,679
During these three years, rain has fallen
and there has been peace.'

1732
02:16:28,679 --> 02:16:32,679
'And the Queen, who has slept with him as
his wife?'

1733
02:16:32,679 --> 02:16:37,889
'He has not been a husband to her,' was the
answer.

1734
02:16:37,889 --> 02:16:40,379
'He is not a whole man.'

1735
02:16:40,379 --> 02:16:43,889
'Then take him away,' said Monkey.

1736
02:16:43,889 --> 02:16:48,069
'He can thank you for saving him.'

1737
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:55,580
Manjusri said a spell, the magician returned
to his tiger shape, and the God rode him away

1738
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:58,780
over the clouds.

1739
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:04,040
As the pilgrims travelled further on their
journey to the West, they heard a noise that

1740
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:06,990
sounded like a thousand voices.

1741
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:09,209
Dear Monkey!

1742
02:17:09,209 --> 02:17:16,369
He leapt high into the clouds, looked down,
and at a little distance he saw a hill outside

1743
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:17,380
a city.

1744
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:23,419
There, a great crowd of Buddhist priests were
carrying bricks and wood for building.

1745
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:29,570
They were hot and tired and crying out to
the God of Power to give them strength.

1746
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:34,429
'They are going to build a temple,' thought
Monkey.

1747
02:17:34,429 --> 02:17:42,200
But suddenly the gates of the city opened
and two Taoist priests came out.

1748
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:46,340
Monkey saw at once that the Buddhists were
afraid of them.

1749
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:50,440
He thought, 'This must be the city I have
heard about.

1750
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:56,300
The religion of Buddha has been destroyed
here.'

1751
02:17:56,300 --> 02:18:03,799
Monkey transformed himself into a Taoist magician,
walked towards the two young Taoist priests

1752
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:05,419
and bowed low.

1753
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:10,490
'Can a poor Taoist find food in this city?'

1754
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:13,320
'Oh, yes,' said the priests.

1755
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:18,160
'Even the King is pleased to give food to
Taoists.

1756
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:25,070
Twenty years ago there was not enough food
in this place and it was saved by three Taoist

1757
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:28,250
Immortals who came out of the sky.

1758
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:33,889
They can bring wind or rain or turn stones
into gold.'

1759
02:18:33,889 --> 02:18:38,879
'Your king is lucky to have these Immortals
here.

1760
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:41,189
I would like to meet him.'

1761
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:45,171
'That is no problem,' said the priests.

1762
02:18:45,171 --> 02:18:51,171
'But first we must count those Buddhists and
check that they are working well.'

1763
02:18:51,171 --> 02:18:54,700
'But they are priests, like us!

1764
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:56,540
We should not make them work.'

1765
02:18:56,540 --> 02:19:04,229
'Well, when we had no food, the Buddhists
prayed to Buddha with no success at all.

1766
02:19:04,230 --> 02:19:09,718
We Taoists prayed to our gods and we were
successful.

1767
02:19:09,718 --> 02:19:16,679
So they are not really priests and we should
really destroy their temples.

1768
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:20,860
But now they work for us as builders and cleaners.'

1769
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:29,251
'Then I cannot meet your masters,' Monkey
said, 'because I am looking for an uncle who

1770
02:19:29,251 --> 02:19:31,930
became a Buddhist priest.'

1771
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:35,350
'That is no problem,' they replied.

1772
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:39,750
'Take our list and check while we wait here.

1773
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:45,100
See if your uncle is among our priests.'

1774
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:50,061
As Monkey walked towards the priests with
the list, they all went down on their knees

1775
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:51,190
in front of him.

1776
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:53,820
'Please don't harm us, Father!'

1777
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:54,881
they said.

1778
02:19:54,881 --> 02:20:01,870
'We have all worked hard and we have never
been ill or missed work.'

1779
02:20:01,870 --> 02:20:04,670
Monkey told them to get up.

1780
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:11,650
He said that they did not need to fear him
- he was only looking for his uncle.

1781
02:20:11,650 --> 02:20:14,311
Hearing this, they all crowded near him.

1782
02:20:14,311 --> 02:20:17,331
'Which of us do you want?'

1783
02:20:17,331 --> 02:20:19,301
they asked.

1784
02:20:19,301 --> 02:20:20,320
Monkey laughed.

1785
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:22,971
'You are priests!' he said.

1786
02:20:22,971 --> 02:20:27,620
'Why do you work as servants instead of reading
the Scriptures?'

1787
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:32,320
'Ah, don't laugh at us,' cried the priests.

1788
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:38,450
'Our King has chosen other masters and we
do what they tell us.

1789
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:44,460
The three Immortals are very powerful and
can perform a lot of magic.

1790
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:49,460
Now they are using magic to keep the King
young.

1791
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:52,171
That is why he obeys them.'

1792
02:20:52,171 --> 02:20:55,860
'Why do you not run away?' asked Monkey.

1793
02:20:55,860 --> 02:21:03,210
'There are pictures of us in every part of
the country and there are police everywhere.

1794
02:21:03,210 --> 02:21:06,190
Many of us have taken our own lives.

1795
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:14,061
But the spirits tell us that one day a pilgrim
will come and with him is a follower called

1796
02:21:14,061 --> 02:21:16,021
the Monkey King.

1797
02:21:16,021 --> 02:21:23,830
He will use his great powers to right wrongs,
and he will free us.'

1798
02:21:23,830 --> 02:21:27,320
Monkey went back to the two Taoist priests.

1799
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:30,660
They asked him if he had found his relative.

1800
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:35,620
'They are all relatives of mine,' replied
Monkey.

1801
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:42,450
'Two hundred on my father's side and three
hundred on my mother's.

1802
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:45,260
I would like you to free them.'

1803
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:48,900
'We cannot do that!' said the priests.

1804
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:54,750
'One or two of them can stop work if they
are ill, but all of them?

1805
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:56,080
Impossible!

1806
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:58,391
You must be mad!'

1807
02:21:58,391 --> 02:22:05,820
'Really?' said Monkey and, taking his cudgel,
he killed them where they stood.

1808
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:08,840
The Buddhists came running.

1809
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,870
'Oh, what have you done!'

1810
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:11,870
they said.

1811
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:15,910
'The people will say that we killed the priests!

1812
02:22:15,910 --> 02:22:21,080
You must come to the King at once and explain
that you are responsible.'

1813
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:25,420
'I am not what you think I am,' said Monkey.

1814
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:29,110
'I am the one who has come to free you.'

1815
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:32,870
'But you are a murderer!' said the Buddhist
priests.

1816
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:36,580
'The spirits described the one who will free
us.

1817
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:44,420
He has a flat head, bright red eyes, a hairy
face and no chin.'

1818
02:22:44,420 --> 02:22:51,320
Monkey transformed himself back from a Taoist
priest into himself, and the Buddhists bowed

1819
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:53,490
in front of him.

1820
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:55,800
'Now go away from here!'

1821
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:56,800
cried Monkey.

1822
02:22:56,800 --> 02:23:00,660
'But first I shall give you some protecting
magic.'

1823
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:03,610
Dear Monkey!

1824
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:09,500
He pulled out a handful of his hairs, bit
them into pieces and gave a small piece to

1825
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:12,181
each of the Buddhists.

1826
02:23:12,181 --> 02:23:14,501
'Put this behind your ear.

1827
02:23:14,501 --> 02:23:21,080
If you are in any danger, press your ear and
call out "Monkey King!"

1828
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:28,070
I will come at once to help you, even if I
am thousands of kilometres away.'

1829
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:33,730
Some of the braver priests tested the hairs
and called out 'Monkey King!'

1830
02:23:33,730 --> 02:23:38,950
At once a thunder god with a great cudgel
appeared.

1831
02:23:38,950 --> 02:23:43,190
'If you say "Quiet", he will disappear,' Monkey
told them.

1832
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:49,011
And at the word 'Quiet', he disappeared.

1833
02:23:49,011 --> 02:23:54,880
'Don't go far from this place and there will
be news for you soon,' Monkey called as the

1834
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:56,280
priests departed.

1835
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:01,460
He left to tell Tripitaka what had happened.

1836
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:06,540
As the pilgrims entered the city, some people
were afraid of them.

1837
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:14,101
But an old Buddhist priest recognised Monkey
and shouted, 'I have dreamt of you, Monkey

1838
02:24:14,101 --> 02:24:15,461
King.

1839
02:24:15,461 --> 02:24:21,011
Thanks to you, we are not ghosts - we are
living men.'

1840
02:24:21,011 --> 02:24:29,040
That night, Monkey's head was so full of plans
for the next day that he could not sleep.

1841
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:35,160
He got up, looked down into the street and
saw that the Taoists were all celebrating

1842
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:36,970
in the temple.

1843
02:24:36,970 --> 02:24:41,230
They were led by the three Immortals.

1844
02:24:41,230 --> 02:24:44,840
At once, Monkey went to find Pigsy and Sandy.

1845
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:49,601
'Come and have some fun,' he whispered in
Sandy's ear.

1846
02:24:49,601 --> 02:24:55,960
'Who wants fun in the middle of the night?'
said Sandy, sleepily.

1847
02:24:55,960 --> 02:25:00,780
'The Taoist Temple has plenty of food in it,'
said Monkey.

1848
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:05,670
'Bread, cake, fruit, sweets...'

1849
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:08,330
Pigsy woke up at the sound of a list of food.

1850
02:25:08,330 --> 02:25:12,550
'Brother, I am coming too,' he cried.

1851
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:17,330
When they arrived at the temple, Pigsy could
not wait.

1852
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:21,971
'They are all still praying!' he complained.

1853
02:25:21,971 --> 02:25:28,000
'I will soon stop that,' said Monkey, and
he blew hard.

1854
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:33,620
A great wind passed through the temple, blowing
everything on to the ground and putting all

1855
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:36,030
the lights out.

1856
02:25:36,030 --> 02:25:40,130
Frightened in the dark, all the Taoists ran
away.

1857
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:45,260
The three pilgrims went inside and the three
of them finished all the food.

1858
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:51,480
But a little Taoist remembered that he had
left his hand-bell in the temple and went

1859
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,700
back for it.

1860
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:56,960
He opened the door and saw that all the food
was gone.

1861
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:01,271
He ran away to fetch the three Immortals.

1862
02:26:01,271 --> 02:26:06,320
When they came, one of them thought that their
gods had eaten the food.

1863
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:13,450
'Let's pray to them,' the Immortal said, 'for
long life for the King.'

1864
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:16,080
Then Monkey jumped out and called to them.

1865
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:19,960
'How could you be such fools?' he said.

1866
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:23,950
'We are not gods, we are priests from China.

1867
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:29,700
We have eaten all your food and your king
will have to go somewhere else for a long

1868
02:26:29,700 --> 02:26:30,730
life.'

1869
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:38,260
The Taoist Immortals attacked the pilgrims,
but Monkey took Sandy in one hand and Pigsy

1870
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:42,400
in the other and leapt on to a cloud with
them.

1871
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:48,471
In no time, they were back in their beds,
in the hotel where they were staying with

1872
02:26:48,471 --> 02:26:50,540
Tripitaka.

1873
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:56,420
Next day, the King was very angry when he
heard that three Buddhist pilgrims wanted

1874
02:26:56,420 --> 02:26:58,171
to see him.

1875
02:26:58,171 --> 02:27:00,910
But one of his ministers stepped forward.

1876
02:27:00,910 --> 02:27:07,820
'The country of T'ang is fifty thousand kilometres
away,' he said.

1877
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:13,590
'If they really come from there, they must
have magic powers.

1878
02:27:13,590 --> 02:27:15,210
Let's hear them.'

1879
02:27:15,210 --> 02:27:23,311
So the King allowed the pilgrims to come in,
but before they could speak, three important

1880
02:27:23,311 --> 02:27:27,171
Taoists came in and made a report to the King.

1881
02:27:27,171 --> 02:27:33,790
'Yesterday,' they said, 'these three killed
two of our followers and helped five hundred

1882
02:27:33,790 --> 02:27:35,891
Buddhist priests to escape.

1883
02:27:35,891 --> 02:27:41,630
That night, they went into our temple and
ate all the food.'

1884
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:47,040
The angry King ordered the immediate death
of the three pilgrims.

1885
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:52,650
But before anyone could do anything about
the order, some men arrived asking urgently

1886
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:54,670
for rain.

1887
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:58,320
The King thought about the pilgrims' magic
powers.

1888
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:06,141
'There will be a rain-making competition between
you and the Immortals,' he said to the pilgrims.

1889
02:28:06,141 --> 02:28:09,150
'If you win, you will go free.

1890
02:28:09,150 --> 02:28:12,400
If you lose, you will die!'

1891
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:19,400
A tower was quickly built and the King, the
pilgrims and the Immortals went outside.

1892
02:28:19,400 --> 02:28:24,570
'You must say what you are going to pray for,'
said Monkey to an Immortal.

1893
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:29,030
'How else will we know if you are successful?'

1894
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:36,010
When the King heard Monkey's words, he said,
'This little priest is a sensible Monkey.'

1895
02:28:36,010 --> 02:28:39,800
'There is no need to tell you,' said the Immortal.

1896
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:42,670
'The King knows what I am going to do.'

1897
02:28:42,670 --> 02:28:45,430
'That is not what I mean.

1898
02:28:45,430 --> 02:28:47,970
We must each have our programme.

1899
02:28:47,970 --> 02:28:51,221
If we do not, we will get confused.'

1900
02:28:51,221 --> 02:28:52,760
'Yes, fine.

1901
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:56,421
I shall cry out four times,' said the Immortal.

1902
02:28:56,421 --> 02:29:03,380
'At the first cry, wind will come; at the
second, clouds will appear in the sky; at

1903
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:09,391
the third, you will hear thunder; at the fourth,
rain will fall.

1904
02:29:09,391 --> 02:29:14,311
But I shall cry out once more and the rain
will stop.'

1905
02:29:14,311 --> 02:29:16,811
'Please begin,' said Monkey.

1906
02:29:16,811 --> 02:29:20,510
'This will be very entertaining for us.'

1907
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:23,340
The tower was ten metres high.

1908
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:28,971
On each side there were the twenty-eight flags
of the Great House of the Moon.

1909
02:29:28,971 --> 02:29:34,421
There was a long table with burners on it,
which gave a sweet-smelling smoke.

1910
02:29:34,421 --> 02:29:39,421
There was a metal plate with the name of the
thunder-spirit written on it next to each

1911
02:29:39,421 --> 02:29:40,421
burner.

1912
02:29:40,421 --> 02:29:48,450
At the foot of the table there were five great
bowls of clear water with flowers in them.

1913
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:54,280
Behind the tower were some Taoists writing
down religious teachings.

1914
02:29:54,280 --> 02:29:59,790
The Immortal went to the tower and climbed
to the top.

1915
02:29:59,790 --> 02:30:06,711
With his sword in his hand, he recited spells,
and a strong wind was heard and felt in the

1916
02:30:06,711 --> 02:30:07,990
air above.

1917
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:11,760
'That is bad,' whispered Pigsy.

1918
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,090
'He is winning.'

1919
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:18,601
'Quiet, Brother,' whispered Monkey, 'and leave
it to me.'

1920
02:30:18,601 --> 02:30:20,391
Dear Monkey!

1921
02:30:20,391 --> 02:30:26,460
He leapt into the air and cried, 'Who is in
charge of the wind?'

1922
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:30,490
At once, the Old Woman of the Wind appeared.

1923
02:30:30,490 --> 02:30:35,811
'I am protecting Tripitaka on his way to India,'
said Monkey.

1924
02:30:35,811 --> 02:30:40,141
'We are having a rain-making competition with
the Immortals here.

1925
02:30:40,141 --> 02:30:43,370
Why are you helping them instead of us?

1926
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:45,730
Stop that wind!'

1927
02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:51,940
cried Monkey, and immediately the wind stopped.

1928
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:58,131
The Immortal now hit the tower hard and the
sky filled with clouds.

1929
02:30:58,131 --> 02:31:01,380
'Who is in charge of the clouds?'

1930
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:04,840
cried Monkey, and the Cloud Boy appeared in
front of him.

1931
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:12,370
'Stop the clouds!' he commanded, and again
the sky became clear.

1932
02:31:12,370 --> 02:31:17,540
The Immortal loosened his hair and then knocked
again on the tower.

1933
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:23,881
The Thunder God and the Mother of Lightning
appeared in the sky, but they bowed towards

1934
02:31:23,881 --> 02:31:24,970
Monkey.

1935
02:31:24,970 --> 02:31:31,130
'The Jade Emperor in Heaven,' they said, 'ordered
us to make a storm.'

1936
02:31:31,130 --> 02:31:36,950
'You are allowed to do that,' said Monkey,
'but not yet.'

1937
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:44,590
As there was no thunder and no lightning,
the Immortal was confused as well as angry.

1938
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:47,181
'Listen well,' said Monkey, up in the sky.

1939
02:31:47,181 --> 02:31:49,850
'Here are my orders.

1940
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:54,910
When I point my cudgel upwards once, you will
give me wind.

1941
02:31:54,910 --> 02:31:58,250
Twice, and you will give me clouds.

1942
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:59,821
Three times, thunder and lightning.

1943
02:31:59,821 --> 02:32:03,601
And four times, rain.

1944
02:32:03,601 --> 02:32:09,960
'And when I point it a fifth time, you will
stop the storm.'

1945
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:15,360
The Immortal sadly left the tower and went
to speak to the King.

1946
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:19,420
'I have been watching,' said the King.

1947
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:22,960
'You have not produced either wind or rain.

1948
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,610
What is wrong?'

1949
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:30,730
'The rain-dragons are not at home today,'
said the Immortal.

1950
02:32:30,730 --> 02:32:31,960
'Don't believe him!'

1951
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:32,960
cried Monkey.

1952
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:35,320
'They are all at home.

1953
02:32:35,320 --> 02:32:38,910
That Immortal has no real power over them.

1954
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:43,650
We, the followers of Buddha, will soon put
them to work.

1955
02:32:43,650 --> 02:32:44,841
You will see!'

1956
02:32:44,841 --> 02:32:48,820
'Go to the tower,' said the King to Monkey.

1957
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:53,340
'I will wait here and see if there is any
rain.'

1958
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:58,141
'I need your help too,' said Monkey to Tripitaka.

1959
02:32:58,141 --> 02:33:02,580
'Go quietly to the tower and start reciting
your Scriptures.'

1960
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:10,380
'My dear friend,' said Tripitaka, 'I do not
know anything about making rain!'

1961
02:33:10,380 --> 02:33:14,891
'Don't let him pull you into this,' whispered
Pigsy to Tripitaka.

1962
02:33:14,891 --> 02:33:19,750
'He will blame you if no rain comes.'

1963
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:26,061
'It is true that you do not know how to make
rain,' said Monkey to Tripitaka.

1964
02:33:26,061 --> 02:33:28,960
'But you know how to recite the Scriptures.

1965
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:33,540
If you do that, I will do the rest.'

1966
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:40,680
Tripitaka went up the tower, sat down and
began silently reciting.

1967
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:46,670
Then Monkey took his cudgel from behind his
ear, and made it bigger until it was nearly

1968
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:48,650
a metre long.

1969
02:33:48,650 --> 02:33:51,700
He pointed it towards the sky.

1970
02:33:51,700 --> 02:33:59,190
The Old Woman of the Wind brought out her
bag and when she opened it, a great wind rushed

1971
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:00,311
out of it.

1972
02:34:00,311 --> 02:34:06,780
It blew through the city, lifting stones and
rocks high into the air.

1973
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:13,460
Monkey pointed again and a black cloud covered
the sky, so the people of the city could not

1974
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:16,081
even see their palace.

1975
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:21,210
He pointed again and loud thunder shook the
Earth.

1976
02:34:21,210 --> 02:34:28,001
When he pointed a fourth time, rain fell down
until it seemed that the Yellow River had

1977
02:34:28,001 --> 02:34:30,410
fallen out of the sky.

1978
02:34:30,410 --> 02:34:34,150
In seconds, the whole city was under water.

1979
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:41,290
The people of the city were filled with terror
and they all began saying their prayers.

1980
02:34:41,290 --> 02:34:46,351
The rain fell from early morning until midday.

1981
02:34:46,351 --> 02:34:47,820
'Enough!'

1982
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:49,070
cried the King.

1983
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:54,591
'Stop the rain or nothing will grow this year!'

1984
02:34:54,591 --> 02:35:00,830
Monkey at once pointed a fifth time with his
cudgel and the storm stopped.

1985
02:35:00,830 --> 02:35:05,300
There was not even a cloud in the sky.

1986
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:08,480
'Wonderful priests!'

1987
02:35:08,480 --> 02:35:09,940
cried the happy King.

1988
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:11,990
'So it is true!

1989
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:17,840
There is always a stronger magic than the
strongest!

1990
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:23,750
In the past we have seen our Immortals bring
rain successfully.

1991
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:28,820
But even they could not stop it suddenly.

1992
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:33,210
Light rain always continued for the rest of
the day.

1993
02:35:33,210 --> 02:35:39,870
But these priests stopped the rain completely!'

1994
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:42,610
The Immortal began making excuses.

1995
02:35:42,610 --> 02:35:49,920
'You said that the rain-dragons were not at
home,' the King said, 'and that made it impossible

1996
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,101
to get rain.

1997
02:35:51,101 --> 02:35:52,450
But look!

1998
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:58,120
The Buddhists, in their quiet way, made the
rain fall.

1999
02:35:58,120 --> 02:36:01,180
They were successful, not you.'

2000
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:07,800
Again, the Immortal tried to change the King's
mind, but Monkey jumped in front of him and

2001
02:36:07,800 --> 02:36:09,811
spoke to the King.

2002
02:36:09,811 --> 02:36:14,750
'Sir, the Dragon Kings made the wind, the
clouds and the rain.

2003
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:19,590
They are still in the sky, so would you like
to see them?'

2004
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:21,330
'Of course!'

2005
02:36:21,330 --> 02:36:22,480
cried the King.

2006
02:36:22,480 --> 02:36:28,280
'I have been king for a long time, but I have
never seen a dragon.

2007
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:31,840
I will reward anyone who can show me one.

2008
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:38,501
But if you do not produce a dragon, you will
be punished.'

2009
02:36:38,501 --> 02:36:43,601
The Taoists knew quite well that this was
beyond their powers.

2010
02:36:43,601 --> 02:36:47,740
They tried, but no dragon answered their call.

2011
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:50,501
Then it was Monkey's turn.

2012
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:53,331
'Are you there?'

2013
02:36:53,331 --> 02:36:54,650
Monkey called up into the sky.

2014
02:36:54,650 --> 02:36:59,670
'Let's have a look at you and your brothers.'

2015
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:06,220
When the four Dragon Kings immediately appeared
through the clouds, the King began to burn

2016
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:08,880
sweet-smelling sticks.

2017
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:13,131
His ministers went down on their knees in
front of them.

2018
02:37:13,131 --> 02:37:17,120
'I feel ashamed,' said the King.

2019
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:20,710
'I have troubled them for no reason.

2020
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:24,670
Tell them that I do not want to trouble them
anymore.

2021
02:37:24,670 --> 02:37:32,200
I will find an opportunity to repay them soon
with offerings.'

2022
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:36,780
'Spirits, you can leave us now,' said Monkey.

2023
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:42,240
'The King will repay you with offerings at
the earliest opportunity.'

2024
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:51,700
The Dragons flew off, each to his own ocean,
and again the sky was clear.

2025
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:56,920
The King gave orders for a banquet the next
day, to thank the pilgrims.

2026
02:37:56,920 --> 02:38:02,960
All the Buddhists were invited to return to
the city, and they were welcomed to the banquet

2027
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:05,970
by the King himself.

2028
02:38:05,970 --> 02:38:12,040
After the banquet, the Buddhist priests took
the pilgrims to the gates of the city, and

2029
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:16,650
they gave Monkey back the hairs he had given
them.

2030
02:38:16,650 --> 02:38:26,090
Then Monkey said, 'Now you can see that Buddhism
is the True Way, but you must obey all priests

2031
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:31,330
- Taoist priests too - and become better men.

2032
02:38:31,330 --> 02:38:34,840
Then these hills and streams will be safe
forever.'

2033
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:43,830
The King himself rode out with the pilgrims
far beyond the city's walls, where they said

2034
02:38:43,830 --> 02:38:47,420
goodbye.

2035
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:50,380
CHAPTER FIVE
The River to Heaven

2036
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:55,170
'What has happened to Tripitaka?'

2037
02:38:55,170 --> 02:38:57,300
shouted Monkey from the air.

2038
02:38:57,300 --> 02:39:00,851
'There is no Tripitaka now!'

2039
02:39:00,851 --> 02:39:04,001
Pigsy shouted back.

2040
02:39:04,001 --> 02:39:08,761
They travelled without stopping for many days.

2041
02:39:08,761 --> 02:39:16,131
Then Tripitaka stopped his horse and said
to Monkey, 'Follower, when and where are we

2042
02:39:16,131 --> 02:39:17,870
going to rest?'

2043
02:39:17,870 --> 02:39:25,580
'Comfort,' answered Monkey, 'is for ordinary
people, so pilgrims cannot expect it.

2044
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:34,591
By day or by night, in wet or dry weather,
if there is a road to travel, we must continue.'

2045
02:39:34,591 --> 02:39:39,920
Soon Sandy shouted, 'There is a great river
in front of us!'

2046
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,260
'Wait here!'

2047
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:44,851
cried Monkey, leaping high into the air.

2048
02:39:44,851 --> 02:39:46,550
Soon he was back.

2049
02:39:46,550 --> 02:39:53,641
'I cannot see land on the other side,' he
said, 'but I thought I saw a fisherman.

2050
02:39:53,641 --> 02:39:56,200
He was standing at the water's edge.

2051
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,591
I will ask him about the river.'

2052
02:39:58,591 --> 02:40:02,900
But it was not a fisherman that Monkey had
seen.

2053
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:07,150
It was a sign that said: The River That Leads
to Heaven.

2054
02:40:07,150 --> 02:40:11,500
Few people have reached the other side.

2055
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:15,181
When Tripitaka read this, he cried quietly.

2056
02:40:15,181 --> 02:40:22,140
'I knew so little of the difficulties in our
way, on the road to India,' he said.

2057
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:23,580
'Listen,' said Pigsy.

2058
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:31,120
'That music means there are priests praying
somewhere near here.

2059
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:36,580
They will tell us how we can get across the
river.'

2060
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:42,581
Following the sound, they soon saw a village
of several hundred houses.

2061
02:40:42,581 --> 02:40:46,650
One of them had a flag at its gate and lights
outside.

2062
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:55,250
'I shall go in first,' said Tripitaka, 'because
you three look a little strange and I do not

2063
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:58,690
want people to be frightened.'

2064
02:40:58,690 --> 02:41:05,811
An old man came to the door and when he saw
Tripitaka he said, 'You have come a little

2065
02:41:05,811 --> 02:41:06,811
late.

2066
02:41:06,811 --> 02:41:11,271
The banquet is almost finished and there is
not much to eat.'

2067
02:41:11,271 --> 02:41:15,730
'I did not come for the banquet,' answered
Tripitaka.

2068
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:21,880
'I have come from China and I would like a
bed for the night if that is possible.'

2069
02:41:21,880 --> 02:41:29,240
'China is a very long way away,' said the
old man, whose name was Ch'en.

2070
02:41:29,240 --> 02:41:33,740
'How do I know that your words are true?'

2071
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:36,730
'My three followers have helped me on the
journey.

2072
02:41:36,730 --> 02:41:40,050
They have made it possible for me to travel
so far.'

2073
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:46,820
'Well, they had better come in with you.'

2074
02:41:46,820 --> 02:41:52,380
The three pilgrims came rushing in out of
the dark, leading the white horse, carrying

2075
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:55,230
the luggage and shouting.

2076
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:59,931
The old man fell on the floor, crying, 'Demons!

2077
02:41:59,931 --> 02:42:01,040
Help!

2078
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:02,160
Demons!'

2079
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:07,720
'Not demons,' said Tripitaka, 'but my followers.

2080
02:42:07,720 --> 02:42:16,250
I know they are ugly, but they are very good
at fighting tigers, dragons and other creatures.'

2081
02:42:16,250 --> 02:42:21,540
A group of praying priests jumped up and ran
away in fear.

2082
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:27,820
The pilgrims laughed so loudly at this that
the priests ran even faster.

2083
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:29,900
'You fools!'

2084
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:32,130
cried Tripitaka to his followers.

2085
02:42:32,130 --> 02:42:37,450
'I have tried so hard to teach you to behave
correctly!

2086
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:43,420
Learn this: It is admirable to be good without
being taught.

2087
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:47,500
It is normal to be good after being taught.

2088
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:52,280
Only a fool is taught and then is still bad.

2089
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:57,870
Do you not understand that I will have to
take the blame for this?'

2090
02:42:57,870 --> 02:43:05,881
The three stood silently, so the old man believed
that they really were followers of Tripitaka.

2091
02:43:05,881 --> 02:43:13,080
He sat Tripitaka in the best place at the
table, and food was brought for them all.

2092
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:19,710
Tripitaka began to recite the Scripture Before
Eating, but Pigsy poured all the food into

2093
02:43:19,710 --> 02:43:24,710
his mouth from the bowl before Tripitaka had
finished.

2094
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:34,940
As Pigsy was calling 'More food, more food'
to the servants, the old man spoke to Tripitaka.

2095
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:38,480
'Did you read the sign by the river?

2096
02:43:38,480 --> 02:43:44,730
You were quite near the Temple of the Great
King of Magic,' he said.

2097
02:43:44,730 --> 02:43:48,380
'He is the god who sends us rain.

2098
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:50,670
He makes things grow.'

2099
02:43:50,670 --> 02:43:55,021
But as he spoke, he began to cry loudly.

2100
02:43:55,021 --> 02:44:01,470
'Why are you crying when you speak of the
God?' asked Monkey.

2101
02:44:01,470 --> 02:44:10,790
'That god is an angry god and every year he
takes the life of a boy and a girl, so we

2102
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:13,410
have few children here.

2103
02:44:13,410 --> 02:44:22,760
I have one child, a son called War Boy, and
my brother has one girl, called Much Gold.

2104
02:44:22,760 --> 02:44:29,210
This year our family must give the children
to the God and both of them must die.'

2105
02:44:29,210 --> 02:44:34,500
'Let me see the boy,' said Monkey.

2106
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:40,391
The boy was brought down from his bed and
ran around eating fruit.

2107
02:44:40,391 --> 02:44:46,570
Without a word, Monkey transformed himself
into a boy who looked exactly the same.

2108
02:44:46,570 --> 02:44:51,120
'That is unbelievable,' cried the father.

2109
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:52,120
'Look!

2110
02:44:52,120 --> 02:44:56,960
When I call, both come running to me.'

2111
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:00,010
Monkey then changed back to his own form.

2112
02:45:00,010 --> 02:45:04,780
'I am going to save this child's life,' he
said to the father.

2113
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:10,140
'I will let the Great King of Magic kill me
for the gods.'

2114
02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:14,580
The old man's brother was standing in the
doorway, watching and crying.

2115
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:19,851
'I think you are worried about your daughter,'
said Monkey.

2116
02:45:19,851 --> 02:45:24,671
'Father,' said the old man, 'I cannot lose
her.

2117
02:45:24,671 --> 02:45:26,490
She is my only child.

2118
02:45:26,490 --> 02:45:30,710
Who will cry for me when I die?'

2119
02:45:30,710 --> 02:45:32,610
Monkey pointed at Pigsy.

2120
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:39,340
'If you feed that long-nosed brother of mine
enough,' he said, 'he will transform himself

2121
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:42,920
into your girl and do anything else you ask.

2122
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:48,230
The Great King of Magic can kill us both together.'

2123
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:49,631
Pigsy was shocked.

2124
02:45:49,631 --> 02:45:53,170
'Leave me out of this!' he said.

2125
02:45:53,170 --> 02:45:56,061
'You know what they say,' said Monkey.

2126
02:45:56,061 --> 02:45:59,830
"'Even a chicken must work for its food.'"

2127
02:45:59,830 --> 02:46:04,840
'I am no good at transformations,' complained
Pigsy.

2128
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:12,670
'I can change into a mountain or a tree, but
it is much more difficult to change into a

2129
02:46:12,670 --> 02:46:14,700
small girl.'

2130
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:19,131
'Don't believe him,' said Monkey to the girl's
father.

2131
02:46:19,131 --> 02:46:21,840
'Bring your child.'

2132
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:27,880
Soon the man returned with his child, and
all the priests and servants asked Pigsy to

2133
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:29,120
save her.

2134
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,620
'Here she is,' said Monkey.

2135
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:35,171
'Have a look and be quick.'

2136
02:46:35,171 --> 02:46:41,680
The fool Pigsy shook his head, said a spell
and cried 'Change!'

2137
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:49,030
His head was now the same as the child's but
his big stomach had not changed.

2138
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:58,110
'You can hit me if you like,' complained Pigsy,
'but I cannot do any better than that.'

2139
02:46:58,110 --> 02:47:02,610
'I can see that I will have to help,' said
Monkey.

2140
02:47:02,610 --> 02:47:08,740
And he blew on Pigsy, who was soon like the
child from head to foot.

2141
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:11,610
'What happens now?' asked Monkey.

2142
02:47:11,610 --> 02:47:14,841
'How are we brought to the God?'

2143
02:47:14,841 --> 02:47:17,690
The girl's father came forward.

2144
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:20,271
'It is quite simple,' he said.

2145
02:47:20,271 --> 02:47:27,620
'You sit in two dishes, two men carry you
to the temple, and then the Great King of

2146
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:29,720
Magic eats you.'

2147
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:32,550
'Watch me,' Monkey said to Pigsy.

2148
02:47:32,550 --> 02:47:37,140
'While he is cutting me into pieces, you can
run away.'

2149
02:47:37,140 --> 02:47:40,830
'But he might begin with the girl!'

2150
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:42,670
cried Pigsy.

2151
02:47:42,670 --> 02:47:45,971
'No,' said War Boy's father quietly.

2152
02:47:45,971 --> 02:47:50,070
'The meal always begins with the boy.'

2153
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:54,430
'Well, that is lucky,' said Pigsy.

2154
02:47:54,430 --> 02:48:00,980
Suddenly, they all saw lights outside and
heard the sound of voices as the gate opened.

2155
02:48:00,980 --> 02:48:08,920
A loud voice cried, 'Bring out the boy and
the girl!'

2156
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:15,440
The two fathers cried while the Great King's
servants carried the boy and the girl away.

2157
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:22,490
'Great King,' said the villagers, when everything
was ready, 'we now offer you a boy child,

2158
02:48:22,490 --> 02:48:30,900
War Boy, and a girl child, Much Gold, with
a pig, a sheep and some wine.'

2159
02:48:30,900 --> 02:48:33,980
They then went back to their homes.

2160
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:38,870
'I think I will go home too,' said Pigsy.

2161
02:48:38,870 --> 02:48:41,200
'You have no home,' said Monkey.

2162
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:43,380
'What rubbish you talk!

2163
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:48,341
We have started this job and now we have to
finish it.'

2164
02:48:48,341 --> 02:48:55,360
Just then, a strong wind blew through the
door, and as it opened the Great King appeared.

2165
02:48:55,360 --> 02:49:01,530
He was a horrible creature, with eyes like
fire and teeth like a pig.

2166
02:49:01,530 --> 02:49:08,300
'Which family do you come from?' asked the
Great King.

2167
02:49:08,300 --> 02:49:12,480
'The family of Ch'en,' answered Monkey.

2168
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:16,811
The King did not understand why the boy was
so brave.

2169
02:49:16,811 --> 02:49:21,300
Usually the children were too frightened to
talk before they were killed.

2170
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:26,921
'You understand that I am now going to eat
you?'

2171
02:49:26,921 --> 02:49:29,390
'Do it!' said Monkey.

2172
02:49:29,390 --> 02:49:33,970
'You are too brave,' said the Great King.

2173
02:49:33,970 --> 02:49:39,450
'This time I shall begin with the girl.'

2174
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:42,430
'No, no!' said Pigsy.

2175
02:49:42,430 --> 02:49:45,740
'It is never a good idea to change an old
custom.

2176
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:51,080
Do what you usually do - that is always best.'

2177
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:57,570
The fool leapt off his dish, changed back
into Pigsy, took his fork and hit the Great

2178
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:58,700
King.

2179
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:04,620
Then he and Monkey leapt into the air, just
as the Great King changed into a wind and

2180
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:07,210
disappeared into the river.

2181
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:10,690
'Oh, let him go now,' said Monkey.

2182
02:50:10,690 --> 02:50:16,460
'We will finish him tomorrow and get our Master
across the river.'

2183
02:50:16,460 --> 02:50:22,990
So they returned to Ch'en's farm, where they
were soon asleep in the best room in the house.

2184
02:50:22,990 --> 02:50:28,040
But under the river, the Great King was unhappy.

2185
02:50:28,040 --> 02:50:31,200
He told his fish-servants what had happened.

2186
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:35,190
He told them about Tripitaka, who was like
a god.

2187
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:39,000
If somebody ate him, they would never die.

2188
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:44,950
The Great King's fish-sister made a suggestion.

2189
02:50:44,950 --> 02:50:50,290
'Start a cold wind and a great fall of snow,
so the river freezes.

2190
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:57,851
Then some of us will change into human form
and walk across it, carrying luggage.

2191
02:50:57,851 --> 02:51:04,380
Tripitaka is in such a hurry to get to India
that he will walk across it too.

2192
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:08,210
When you hear him above you, heat the ice.

2193
02:51:08,210 --> 02:51:14,740
The pilgrims will fall through it and you
will have them all.'

2194
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:21,910
Just before the sun came up, Tripitaka and
his followers began to feel cold.

2195
02:51:21,910 --> 02:51:27,090
'Pilgrims,' said Monkey, 'should not feel
either heat or cold.'

2196
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:33,370
But they could not sleep, and when they looked
out of the window everything was white.

2197
02:51:33,370 --> 02:51:38,101
The snow was so lovely that they sat and watched
it fall.

2198
02:51:38,101 --> 02:51:43,311
It was like small pieces of white jade.

2199
02:51:43,311 --> 02:51:50,851
Soon servants brought them hot water to wash
in, hot tea to drink and hot food to eat.

2200
02:51:50,851 --> 02:51:56,210
They even brought heaters for the rooms, but
when the meal was finished the pilgrims were

2201
02:51:56,210 --> 02:51:57,671
colder than ever.

2202
02:51:57,671 --> 02:52:06,101
By now there was nearly a metre of snow outside
and, seeing this, Tripitaka began to cry.

2203
02:52:06,101 --> 02:52:11,570
But towards evening everyone was talking about
the river.

2204
02:52:11,570 --> 02:52:16,030
It had frozen and people were walking on the
ice.

2205
02:52:16,030 --> 02:52:22,080
The next morning the ice was even thicker
and Tripitaka gave thanks to the Gods for

2206
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:25,740
this chance to walk across the river.

2207
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:31,811
'Master,' said Sandy, 'should we not wait
until the ice goes away?

2208
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:35,521
Then we can go across the river in Mr Ch'en's
boat.'

2209
02:52:35,521 --> 02:52:42,490
'But if we wait until the spring,' said Tripitaka,
'we will lose half a year's travelling.

2210
02:52:42,490 --> 02:52:48,470
I promised the Goddess Kuan-yin that the journey
would take three years.

2211
02:52:48,470 --> 02:52:51,000
Already seven have passed.'

2212
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:57,631
He ordered Pigsy to put the luggage on the
horse, and they left.

2213
02:52:57,631 --> 02:53:04,050
When they had gone fifteen or twenty kilometres
across the ice, Pigsy showed Tripitaka how

2214
02:53:04,050 --> 02:53:07,521
to carry his stick across his body.

2215
02:53:07,521 --> 02:53:11,351
'Ice often has holes in it,' he explained.

2216
02:53:11,351 --> 02:53:16,750
'If you put your foot in a hole, you will
go down into the water.

2217
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:21,920
It will close above you and you will never
get out again.

2218
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:27,601
Carry your stick across your body and you
will feel safer.'

2219
02:53:27,601 --> 02:53:32,780
Monkey looked disbelieving, but they all did
as Pigsy had said.

2220
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:37,340
They rode all night until the sun began to
come up.

2221
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:44,120
Then they stopped to eat some food from their
luggage and then continued towards the West.

2222
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:51,021
But after some time, the ice began to break
and the white horse almost fell.

2223
02:53:51,021 --> 02:53:57,500
They continued walking, not knowing that the
Great King and his fish-followers were waiting

2224
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:58,710
below.

2225
02:53:58,710 --> 02:54:03,490
Suddenly, a great hole opened in the ice.

2226
02:54:03,490 --> 02:54:10,250
Monkey at once leapt high into the air, but
the white horse and all the others fell through

2227
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:11,750
it.

2228
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:21,550
The Great King took Tripitaka and carried
him down to the Great Palace under the water.

2229
02:54:21,550 --> 02:54:25,730
'Where is my fish-sister?' said the Great
King.

2230
02:54:25,730 --> 02:54:29,011
'Come, fetch the sharp knives.

2231
02:54:29,011 --> 02:54:32,220
Let's eat Tripitaka and live forever.'

2232
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:36,590
'Great King,' answered the Fish-Sister.

2233
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:43,260
'Let's wait for a couple of days until we
can be sure that his followers cannot spoil

2234
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:45,750
our fun.'

2235
02:54:45,750 --> 02:54:54,460
The King agreed, and Tripitaka was put in
a great stone box at the back of the palace.

2236
02:54:54,460 --> 02:55:00,910
At the same time, Pigsy and Sandy had managed
to get the luggage out of the water and put

2237
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:02,851
it on to the horse's back.

2238
02:55:02,851 --> 02:55:06,710
They started swimming back the way they had
come.

2239
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:09,610
'What has happened to Tripitaka?'

2240
02:55:09,610 --> 02:55:12,220
shouted Monkey from the air.

2241
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:15,601
'There is no Tripitaka now!'

2242
02:55:15,601 --> 02:55:17,590
Pigsy shouted back.

2243
02:55:17,590 --> 02:55:28,260
'We are going back to Ch'en's farm.'

2244
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:34,500
Mr Ch'en cried uncontrollably when he heard
what had happened to Tripitaka.

2245
02:55:34,500 --> 02:55:37,070
'Don't worry,' said Monkey.

2246
02:55:37,070 --> 02:55:40,650
'I think the Master will live for a long time.

2247
02:55:40,650 --> 02:55:47,950
Let's dry our clothes and then we will go
back and finish that creature!'

2248
02:55:47,950 --> 02:55:54,900
Back at the river, Monkey asked Pigsy to carry
him down while Sandy swam behind them.

2249
02:55:54,900 --> 02:56:00,021
And at the bottom of the river they found
a gate with the sign Turtle House written

2250
02:56:00,021 --> 02:56:02,160
on it.

2251
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:06,480
Monkey whispered, 'You two hide at each side
of the door!'

2252
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:12,641
Then he changed himself into a fish and swam
inside.

2253
02:56:12,641 --> 02:56:18,601
The Great King and his fish-followers were
talking about eating Tripitaka, but Monkey

2254
02:56:18,601 --> 02:56:20,790
could not see his Master.

2255
02:56:20,790 --> 02:56:26,240
Then he heard Tripitaka crying inside a stone
box.

2256
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:31,771
'Don't worry,' said Monkey, 'we will soon
get you out.'

2257
02:56:31,771 --> 02:56:33,230
'Be quick!

2258
02:56:33,230 --> 02:56:35,430
Oh, be quick!'

2259
02:56:35,430 --> 02:56:39,061
cried Tripitaka from inside his box.

2260
02:56:39,061 --> 02:56:44,011
'I am going now,' said Monkey, 'but I shall
return.'

2261
02:56:44,011 --> 02:56:49,061
And soon he and Pigsy and Sandy were back
at the riverbank.

2262
02:56:49,061 --> 02:56:55,471
'I am not at my best in the water, so it is
not a good plan for me to go down again and

2263
02:56:55,471 --> 02:56:58,230
fight the Great King,' said Monkey.

2264
02:56:58,230 --> 02:57:02,690
'I shall go to the Goddess of the Southern
Ocean for help.

2265
02:57:02,690 --> 02:57:05,131
I shall not waste a minute.'

2266
02:57:05,131 --> 02:57:07,431
Dear Monkey!

2267
02:57:07,431 --> 02:57:14,210
He shot up in the air on a magic light, leapt
on a cloud and found Kuan-yin.

2268
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:18,681
She was expecting him, but had not finished
getting dressed.

2269
02:57:18,681 --> 02:57:22,840
'Let's leave now,' she said, when she saw
Monkey.

2270
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:27,110
'We will go and save Tripitaka.'

2271
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:29,380
Monkey went down on his knees in front of
her.

2272
02:57:29,380 --> 02:57:33,950
'Do you not want to finish dressing first?'
he asked.

2273
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:36,300
'It is too much trouble,' she answered.

2274
02:57:36,300 --> 02:57:39,150
'I am going like this.'

2275
02:57:39,150 --> 02:57:44,390
She left on her cloud, followed by Monkey.

2276
02:57:44,390 --> 02:57:49,590
'Well, that was quick!' said Pigsy, as they
appeared.

2277
02:57:49,590 --> 02:57:58,250
'You did well to get a goddess to come immediately,
before she had even finished combing her hair!'

2278
02:57:58,250 --> 02:58:02,860
The Goddess sailed low over the river like
a cloud.

2279
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:08,430
Untying the belt from her dress, she tied
a basket to it and pulled the basket through

2280
02:58:08,430 --> 02:58:09,730
the water.

2281
02:58:09,730 --> 02:58:19,160
She repeated the words, 'The dead go, the
living stay,' seven times and pulled the basket

2282
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:20,250
up.

2283
02:58:20,250 --> 02:58:22,670
There was a gold fish in it.

2284
02:58:22,670 --> 02:58:26,220
Its tail moved and its eye stared.

2285
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:33,811
'Go at once into the water and fetch your
Master,' said the Goddess to Monkey.

2286
02:58:33,811 --> 02:58:38,410
'But what shall I do with the Great King?'
asked Monkey.

2287
02:58:38,410 --> 02:58:42,970
'The Great King is in the basket,' said the
Goddess.

2288
02:58:42,970 --> 02:58:47,870
'He used to live in a little pool in my garden.

2289
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:54,380
Every day he used to put his head out and
listen to the Scriptures, until at last he

2290
02:58:54,380 --> 02:58:57,430
held great magical powers.

2291
02:58:57,430 --> 02:59:04,021
But one day there was a great storm and the
water took him far out to sea.

2292
02:59:04,021 --> 02:59:09,681
I thought that he might be using his magic
against your Master.

2293
02:59:09,681 --> 02:59:17,980
So without stopping to comb my hair, I made
this magic basket to catch him in.'

2294
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:23,811
'If you want to make humans believe in the
Gods,' said Monkey, 'you will wait here.

2295
02:59:23,811 --> 02:59:30,640
I will call the people of the village to hear
this story and look at your golden face.'

2296
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:37,021
So men and women, young and old, were soon
hurrying to the river to go down on their

2297
02:59:37,021 --> 02:59:39,910
knees in front of the Goddess.

2298
02:59:39,910 --> 02:59:47,720
One of them later painted a famous painting
called Kuan-yin with the Fish Basket.

2299
02:59:47,720 --> 02:59:54,541
When the Goddess had returned to the Southern
Ocean, Pigsy and Sandy dived down to the Great

2300
02:59:54,541 --> 02:59:57,180
King's palace.

2301
02:59:57,180 --> 03:00:03,320
All the Great King's fish-followers were dead,
so they soon helped Tripitaka out of the stone

2302
03:00:03,320 --> 03:00:06,400
box and took him back to Ch'en's farm.

2303
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:13,760
'We are sorry, Sirs,' said the Ch'en brothers,
'that you had so many problems.'

2304
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:17,421
'Oh, that is all finished now,' said Monkey.

2305
03:00:17,421 --> 03:00:24,250
'The important thing is that next year, and
every other year, your village will not lose

2306
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:26,160
its children.

2307
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:31,890
But we would be glad if you could give us
a boat to carry us across the river.'

2308
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:35,080
All the villagers started to make boats.

2309
03:00:35,080 --> 03:00:42,351
But when the pilgrims went back to the river,
they heard a voice: 'Oh, great Monkey King,

2310
03:00:42,351 --> 03:00:45,181
you do not need to build a boat.

2311
03:00:45,181 --> 03:00:46,840
I will take you.'

2312
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:54,680
And above the waters they saw the white head
and the enormous body of a turtle.

2313
03:00:54,680 --> 03:00:56,380
'You!'

2314
03:00:56,380 --> 03:00:57,380
cried Monkey.

2315
03:00:57,380 --> 03:00:59,021
'You demon!

2316
03:00:59,021 --> 03:01:03,250
If you come near us, I will kill you with
my cudgel.'

2317
03:01:03,250 --> 03:01:07,011
'Great Monkey King,' said the turtle,

2318
03:01:07,011 --> 03:01:08,431
'listen to me.

2319
03:01:08,431 --> 03:01:11,631
I am not a follower of the Great King.

2320
03:01:11,631 --> 03:01:15,480
His palace below the river used to be mine.

2321
03:01:15,480 --> 03:01:22,640
Then one day that creature came swimming into
the river killed many of my family and made

2322
03:01:22,640 --> 03:01:25,021
the others work for him.

2323
03:01:25,021 --> 03:01:31,851
I am grateful for all that you have done - you
have made us free again.'

2324
03:01:31,851 --> 03:01:39,091
'Promise me and promise the Gods that this
is all true,' said Monkey.

2325
03:01:39,091 --> 03:01:42,750
The turtle opened his red mouth wide.

2326
03:01:42,750 --> 03:01:46,730
'I promise you and all the Gods.

2327
03:01:46,730 --> 03:01:56,580
If I do not take Tripitaka safely across the
river, my bones will turn to water.'

2328
03:01:56,580 --> 03:02:04,120
The turtle came out of the river, and people
saw that his back was fifteen metres wide.

2329
03:02:04,120 --> 03:02:08,730
'Climb on the turtle's back,' called Monkey
to the others.

2330
03:02:08,730 --> 03:02:12,141
'He has promised that we will be safe.

2331
03:02:12,141 --> 03:02:19,311
When creatures speak human language, their
words are usually true.'

2332
03:02:19,311 --> 03:02:23,931
The white horse was led to the middle of the
turtle's back.

2333
03:02:23,931 --> 03:02:31,021
Tripitaka stood to the left, Sandy to the
right, and Pigsy behind the horse's tail.

2334
03:02:31,021 --> 03:02:34,360
Monkey put himself in front of the horse's
head.

2335
03:02:34,360 --> 03:02:37,271
'Now, turtle,' he cried.

2336
03:02:37,271 --> 03:02:43,370
'Go gently, because if you do not, there will
be a cudgel on your head!'

2337
03:02:43,370 --> 03:02:49,521
With this warning, the turtle moved smoothly
over the water.

2338
03:02:49,521 --> 03:02:55,351
As the pilgrims left, all the people of the
village bowed and thanked Buddha.

2339
03:02:55,351 --> 03:03:03,870
The turtle travelled quickly, and in less
than a day they had arrived at the other side.

2340
03:03:03,870 --> 03:03:08,431
Tripitaka said to the turtle, 'I have nothing
that I can give you.

2341
03:03:08,431 --> 03:03:12,940
But I would like to thank you for taking us
across the river.'

2342
03:03:12,940 --> 03:03:19,141
'Master,' replied the turtle, 'there is something
that you could do for me.

2343
03:03:19,141 --> 03:03:26,780
I have been trying to become perfect for about
a thousand years, and that is a long time.

2344
03:03:26,780 --> 03:03:32,400
I can now use human speech, but I am still
a turtle.

2345
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:39,311
Please ask the Buddha if I can become a human.'

2346
03:03:39,311 --> 03:03:45,170
Tripitaka gladly promised to ask Buddha the
question, and the turtle swam back to his

2347
03:03:45,170 --> 03:03:48,080
home in the river.

2348
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:54,751
Again Pigsy carried the luggage, and Monkey
helped Tripitaka on to the white horse.

2349
03:03:54,751 --> 03:03:59,660
With Sandy behind them, they soon found the
road to the West.

2350
03:03:59,660 --> 03:04:02,720
They travelled for many months.

2351
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:06,561
The country was very different from anything
they had seen before.

2352
03:04:06,561 --> 03:04:13,480
The flowers were like jewels, the grass looked
magical and there were strange and wonderful

2353
03:04:13,480 --> 03:04:14,480
trees.

2354
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:19,820
In every village, families were entertaining
priests.

2355
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:24,930
On every hill, Immortals were practising control
over their bodies.

2356
03:04:24,930 --> 03:04:31,010
In every wood, pilgrims were reciting and
singing.

2357
03:04:31,010 --> 03:04:36,930
Every night, they found somewhere to stay
and left again at the first light of day.

2358
03:04:36,930 --> 03:04:44,540
They travelled on in this way for many more
days until suddenly the light grew bright

2359
03:04:44,540 --> 03:04:47,700
and they saw a wonderful castle.

2360
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:55,200
'Monkey,' said Tripitaka admiringly, pointing
at it, 'that's a fine place!'

2361
03:04:55,200 --> 03:05:03,051
'Do you remember,' said Monkey, 'how often
on our journey you have bowed in front of

2362
03:05:03,051 --> 03:05:09,180
the caves and hiding-places and palaces of
false magicians?

2363
03:05:09,180 --> 03:05:15,931
It is strange that you do not even get off
your horse now - when you see the Buddha's

2364
03:05:15,931 --> 03:05:18,480
holy castle!'

2365
03:05:18,480 --> 03:05:24,521
So Tripitaka, in great excitement, jumped
down from his horse.

2366
03:05:24,521 --> 03:05:29,500
When they reached the gates, a young priest
came out to greet them.

2367
03:05:29,500 --> 03:05:35,790
He asked, 'Are you the pilgrims who have come
from the East for the Scriptures?'

2368
03:05:35,790 --> 03:05:43,230
The boy was dressed in beautiful clothes and
carried a bowl of jade dust in his hand.

2369
03:05:43,230 --> 03:05:47,140
Monkey knew him at once, and turned to Tripitaka.

2370
03:05:47,140 --> 03:05:54,820
'This,' he said, 'is the Golden-Headed Immortal
of the Jade Temple at the foot of the Holy

2371
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:56,110
Mountain.'

2372
03:05:56,110 --> 03:06:02,311
'Here you are at last!' said the Golden-Headed
Immortal.

2373
03:06:02,311 --> 03:06:08,940
'It is now ten years since the Goddess Kuan-yin
told me to expect your arrival.

2374
03:06:08,940 --> 03:06:15,240
Year after year I have waited, but there has
been no sign!'

2375
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:24,460
'Great Immortal,' said Tripitaka, bowing low,
'I cannot thank you enough for your patience.'

2376
03:06:24,460 --> 03:06:30,700
Inside the temple, sweet-smelling hot water
was brought to wash in, and after supper the

2377
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:33,811
pilgrims were shown to their beds.

2378
03:06:33,811 --> 03:06:41,530
Early the next day, Tripitaka put on his finest
clothes and jewellery and greeted the young

2379
03:06:41,530 --> 03:06:42,530
Immortal.

2380
03:06:42,530 --> 03:06:47,171
'That is better,' said the young Immortal.

2381
03:06:47,171 --> 03:06:55,150
'Yesterday you looked rather untidy, but today
you look like a true child of Buddha!

2382
03:06:55,150 --> 03:06:57,860
You must let me show you the way.

2383
03:06:57,860 --> 03:07:04,780
Monkey knows it, but only by air, and you
must travel on the ground.'

2384
03:07:04,780 --> 03:07:11,230
Taking Tripitaka by the hand, he led the pilgrims
through the temple gardens to the back of

2385
03:07:11,230 --> 03:07:15,331
the building and up a path to the hill behind.

2386
03:07:15,331 --> 03:07:21,290
'Do you see that mountain in front of you?'
said the young Immortal, pointing up.

2387
03:07:21,290 --> 03:07:24,940
'That is where Buddha has his home.

2388
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:28,471
I shall now turn back.'

2389
03:07:28,471 --> 03:07:33,890
Tripitaka at once began bowing low, hitting
his head on the holy ground.

2390
03:07:33,890 --> 03:07:39,511
'If you are going to do that all the way up,'
said Monkey, 'there will not be much of your

2391
03:07:39,511 --> 03:07:43,561
head left by the time we get there!'

2392
03:07:43,561 --> 03:07:50,320
So Tripitaka stopped bowing and they climbed
some way, walking easily.

2393
03:07:50,320 --> 03:07:55,681
Then they came to a fast-moving river with
rough water.

2394
03:07:55,681 --> 03:07:58,660
Tripitaka said, 'This cannot be the way.'

2395
03:07:58,660 --> 03:08:06,341
But then he saw a bridge and a sign which
said Cloud Reach Bridge.

2396
03:08:06,341 --> 03:08:12,190
When they came to the bridge, they saw that
it was just some trees laid end to end.

2397
03:08:12,190 --> 03:08:16,340
It was only a little wider than a man's hand.

2398
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:17,480
'Monkey!'

2399
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:19,660
cried Tripitaka, afraid.

2400
03:08:19,660 --> 03:08:22,851
'I cannot walk across that!'

2401
03:08:22,851 --> 03:08:27,840
'Yes, yes, people walk across it to get to
the Buddha.

2402
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:30,480
Wait while I show you how!'

2403
03:08:30,480 --> 03:08:32,530
Dear Monkey!

2404
03:08:32,530 --> 03:08:38,521
He walked confidently up to the bridge, leapt
lightly on to it and was soon waving from

2405
03:08:38,521 --> 03:08:39,921
the other side.

2406
03:08:39,921 --> 03:08:44,431
'Follow me!' he shouted back.

2407
03:08:44,431 --> 03:08:51,471
But Pigsy and Sandy repeated to themselves,
'It cannot be done.'

2408
03:08:51,471 --> 03:08:54,851
Tripitaka did not move at all.

2409
03:08:54,851 --> 03:08:59,561
Monkey leapt back again and started pulling
at Pigsy.

2410
03:08:59,561 --> 03:09:02,330
'Fool, follow me across!'

2411
03:09:02,330 --> 03:09:06,811
But Pigsy lay flat on the ground and refused
to move.

2412
03:09:06,811 --> 03:09:13,351
'If you do not come, how will you ever become
a Buddha?' said Monkey.

2413
03:09:13,351 --> 03:09:22,061
'Buddha or no Buddha,' answered Pigsy, 'I
will not go on that bridge!'

2414
03:09:22,061 --> 03:09:26,291
As they all started arguing, a boatman appeared
with a boat.

2415
03:09:26,291 --> 03:09:30,370
He was shouting, 'Who wants to cross the river?'

2416
03:09:30,370 --> 03:09:36,040
But when the boat came nearer, they saw that
it had no bottom.

2417
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:43,880
Monkey, with his sharp eyesight, had recognised
the boatman as the Bringer of Souls, but he

2418
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:45,900
did not tell the others.

2419
03:09:45,900 --> 03:09:52,490
'How can you take people across a river in
a bottomless boat?' asked Tripitaka.

2420
03:09:52,490 --> 03:09:55,800
'Many pilgrims ask me that,' he answered.

2421
03:09:55,800 --> 03:10:03,230
'But since the beginning of time I have carried
too many souls to count.'

2422
03:10:03,230 --> 03:10:06,431
'Get in the boat, Master,' said Monkey.

2423
03:10:06,431 --> 03:10:10,641
'You will find that it will carry you quite
easily and pleasantly.'

2424
03:10:10,641 --> 03:10:19,230
But Tripitaka still did not get in, so Monkey
pushed him into the boat and Tripitaka immediately

2425
03:10:19,230 --> 03:10:22,431
fell out into the water.

2426
03:10:22,431 --> 03:10:26,110
The boatman caught him and pulled him in again.

2427
03:10:26,110 --> 03:10:33,130
He sat there, unhappily squeezing the water
out of his clothes and complaining to Monkey,

2428
03:10:33,130 --> 03:10:37,101
who had more important things to think about.

2429
03:10:37,101 --> 03:10:44,011
Monkey put Pigsy, Sandy and the white horse
on the side of the boat with Tripitaka.

2430
03:10:44,011 --> 03:10:50,300
The boat left and the boatman had taken them
some way down the river when they saw a body

2431
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:52,970
in the water.

2432
03:10:52,970 --> 03:10:55,311
Tripitaka looked very frightened.

2433
03:10:55,311 --> 03:10:56,311
Monkey laughed.

2434
03:10:56,311 --> 03:10:59,370
'Don't be frightened, Master,' he said.

2435
03:10:59,370 --> 03:11:01,390
'That is you.'

2436
03:11:01,390 --> 03:11:06,061
And Pigsy cried, 'It is you, it is you!'

2437
03:11:06,061 --> 03:11:14,910
The boatman said the same words to Tripitaka,
adding, 'There you go!

2438
03:11:14,910 --> 03:11:16,021
Congratulations!'

2439
03:11:16,021 --> 03:11:21,260
Safe on the other side of the river, Tripitaka
stepped out of the boat.

2440
03:11:21,260 --> 03:11:27,430
His earthly body was gone now, gone into the
river, and all the foolishness of his early

2441
03:11:27,430 --> 03:11:29,490
years was washed away.

2442
03:11:29,490 --> 03:11:36,730
He now had the highest wisdom, the Wisdom
of the Far Side of the River, and there is

2443
03:11:36,730 --> 03:11:40,891
no end to that wisdom.

2444
03:11:40,891 --> 03:11:47,610
Before they could thank him, the boatman and
his boat had disappeared, and now Monkey explained

2445
03:11:47,610 --> 03:11:50,641
who the boatman was.

2446
03:11:50,641 --> 03:11:56,540
Tripitaka began thanking his followers for
all they had done for him, but Monkey interrupted.

2447
03:11:56,540 --> 03:12:01,320
'We should all give thanks to each other,'
he said.

2448
03:12:01,320 --> 03:12:07,890
'This journey was too difficult for one man
alone, and without all of us the Master could

2449
03:12:07,890 --> 03:12:11,561
not lose his human body.'

2450
03:12:11,561 --> 03:12:18,530
With a strange feeling of lightness and great
happiness, they went up the Holy Mountain.

2451
03:12:18,530 --> 03:12:26,021
Near the top, Immortals greeted the pilgrims
and then they were met by the Keeper of Metal,

2452
03:12:26,021 --> 03:12:29,350
Wood, Water, Fire and Earth.

2453
03:12:29,350 --> 03:12:35,891
'So you are here at last, Great Priest,' he
smiled.

2454
03:12:35,891 --> 03:12:44,181
'Your follower Hsuan Tsang, the priest Tripitaka,
has finally arrived,' said Tripitaka, bowing.

2455
03:12:44,181 --> 03:12:52,021
The Great Buddha was very pleased at the news
and ordered all the Gods to come to him.

2456
03:12:52,021 --> 03:12:59,220
Then his command was shouted for everyone
to hear: 'The priest of Tsang must be brought

2457
03:12:59,220 --> 03:13:00,220
in.'

2458
03:13:00,220 --> 03:13:10,061
Tripitaka, Monkey, Pigsy and Sandy all went
in, followed by the white horse and the luggage.

2459
03:13:10,061 --> 03:13:16,280
In the Great Hall they first lay flat in front
of Buddha, then bowed to the right and to

2460
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:18,430
the left.

2461
03:13:18,430 --> 03:13:25,800
Then Tripitaka said, 'The follower of Buddha,
Hsuan Tsang, has come by order of the Emperor

2462
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:31,061
of the great land of T'ang to fetch the True
Scriptures.

2463
03:13:31,061 --> 03:13:34,021
They will save all the people of the world.

2464
03:13:34,021 --> 03:13:41,021
I ask the Great Buddha for these Scriptures
and also to allow me a quick return to my

2465
03:13:41,021 --> 03:13:43,850
own country.'

2466
03:13:43,850 --> 03:13:52,061
Then the Great Buddha said these words: 'In
all your great Eastern Land there is killing

2467
03:13:52,061 --> 03:13:57,540
and lying; there are bad thoughts and bad
actions.

2468
03:13:57,540 --> 03:14:04,180
But I have three baskets of Scriptures that
can save the people.

2469
03:14:04,180 --> 03:14:08,971
One contains the Law, which tells of Heaven.

2470
03:14:08,971 --> 03:14:14,030
One contains the Lessons, which tell of Earth.

2471
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:20,290
One contains the Scriptures, which save the
Dead.

2472
03:14:20,290 --> 03:14:26,230
They are written in fifteen thousand one hundred
and forty-four books.

2473
03:14:26,230 --> 03:14:33,470
They are the Path to Perfection, the gate
that leads to True Good.

2474
03:14:33,470 --> 03:14:43,730
In them you can learn everything about men,
birds, animals, flowers, trees, stars and

2475
03:14:43,730 --> 03:14:44,921
Earth.

2476
03:14:44,921 --> 03:14:49,490
I would like to give them all to you.

2477
03:14:49,490 --> 03:14:55,061
But the people of China are too foolish to
understand them.

2478
03:14:55,061 --> 03:15:04,131
So a few books from each basket will be given
to these priests to take back to the East.'

2479
03:15:04,131 --> 03:15:11,150
The pilgrims were taken to a lower room and
shown the books from each basket.

2480
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:17,061
Then they were given food of a beauty and
taste that was unknown on Earth.

2481
03:15:17,061 --> 03:15:22,600
When they had finished eating, two followers
of Buddha took them to a special room down

2482
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:24,690
some stairs.

2483
03:15:24,690 --> 03:15:29,660
The door was opened and a magic light filled
the room.

2484
03:15:29,660 --> 03:15:35,090
On the many beautiful jewelled boxes were
written the names of the holy books.

2485
03:15:35,090 --> 03:15:42,680
The two followers of Buddha led Tripitaka
to the place where the Scriptures lay.

2486
03:15:42,680 --> 03:15:48,380
After inviting him to study the titles, they
asked Tripitaka to show them the gifts he

2487
03:15:48,380 --> 03:15:50,500
had brought for them.

2488
03:15:50,500 --> 03:15:55,240
They planned to give him the Scriptures in
return.

2489
03:15:55,240 --> 03:16:00,120
'I have brought nothing at all for you,' said
Tripitaka.

2490
03:16:00,120 --> 03:16:09,750
'On my journey I have sometimes received gifts,
but nobody has ever asked for gifts in return.'

2491
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:15,650
And Monkey, hearing these words, shouted angrily,
'Come with me, Master!

2492
03:16:15,650 --> 03:16:20,141
We will see what Buddha says about this!'

2493
03:16:20,141 --> 03:16:24,510
One of the two followers said quickly, 'There
is no need to shout.

2494
03:16:24,510 --> 03:16:28,271
Come here and fetch your Scriptures.'

2495
03:16:28,271 --> 03:16:34,811
The pilgrims hid their anger, put the Scriptures
on the horse's back and bowed to Buddha's

2496
03:16:34,811 --> 03:16:35,980
followers.

2497
03:16:35,980 --> 03:16:39,470
Then they left, down the mountain.

2498
03:16:39,470 --> 03:16:45,820
The Buddha of the Past was sitting in an upper
room and had heard everything the two followers

2499
03:16:45,820 --> 03:16:47,120
had said.

2500
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:53,240
He was sure they had given the pilgrims Scriptures
with nothing written on them because they

2501
03:16:53,240 --> 03:16:55,420
had received no gifts.

2502
03:16:55,420 --> 03:17:00,730
So he sent a messenger after the pilgrims
and, of course, the Buddha of the Past was

2503
03:17:00,730 --> 03:17:02,171
correct.

2504
03:17:02,171 --> 03:17:08,320
When the pilgrims opened the Scriptures, they
saw only white pages.

2505
03:17:08,320 --> 03:17:13,391
Tripitaka cried, 'How can I go back to the
Emperor of T'ang with these?

2506
03:17:13,391 --> 03:17:15,940
He will think I am laughing at him.

2507
03:17:15,940 --> 03:17:17,891
He will order my death.'

2508
03:17:17,891 --> 03:17:21,450
'I know the reason for this.

2509
03:17:21,450 --> 03:17:27,820
Those two followers did not get any gifts,
so you did not get any Scriptures!

2510
03:17:27,820 --> 03:17:32,181
We will have to go back to Buddha,' said Monkey.

2511
03:17:32,181 --> 03:17:34,921
They went back at once.

2512
03:17:34,921 --> 03:17:36,881
'Listen to this!'

2513
03:17:36,881 --> 03:17:37,961
shouted Monkey to Buddha.

2514
03:17:37,961 --> 03:17:45,080
'They have given us white pages with no words
on them because we did not bring them gifts.'

2515
03:17:45,080 --> 03:17:48,880
'You need not shout,' said Buddha, smiling.

2516
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:55,980
'I have sometimes thought that perhaps it
should not be too easy to get the Scriptures.

2517
03:17:55,980 --> 03:18:02,900
My two followers expected a gift because of
a bad experience they had.

2518
03:18:02,900 --> 03:18:10,150
Not long ago, I gave them permission to go
down the mountain with some Scriptures.

2519
03:18:10,150 --> 03:18:17,181
After letting Chao read a few Scriptures to
his people, my followers were given only some

2520
03:18:17,181 --> 03:18:19,230
rice in return.

2521
03:18:19,230 --> 03:18:25,260
The result of hearing these Scriptures was
that his people were protected from all their

2522
03:18:25,260 --> 03:18:27,350
enemies.

2523
03:18:27,350 --> 03:18:34,220
Afterwards I told my two followers that they
had sold the Scriptures too cheaply.

2524
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:38,470
So, you see, they are not to blame.

2525
03:18:38,470 --> 03:18:43,171
In fact, these white pages are the True Scriptures.

2526
03:18:43,171 --> 03:18:51,840
But the people of China are not very clever,
so they cannot understand such things.

2527
03:18:51,840 --> 03:18:57,950
You had better have some scriptures with writing
on them.'

2528
03:18:57,950 --> 03:19:03,851
This time Tripitaka offered the two Buddhist
followers the only gift he could think of

2529
03:19:03,851 --> 03:19:06,170
- his golden bowl.

2530
03:19:06,170 --> 03:19:12,180
He had received this bowl from the Emperor
of China, who told him to use it for collecting

2531
03:19:12,180 --> 03:19:16,370
money from kind people on his journey.

2532
03:19:16,370 --> 03:19:21,800
The followers accepted the gift, but many
of the Gods laughed because it was such a

2533
03:19:21,800 --> 03:19:26,561
small present.

2534
03:19:26,561 --> 03:19:32,471
As they started to leave again, the Goddess
Kuan-yin appeared in front of Buddha.

2535
03:19:32,471 --> 03:19:38,790
'I found this man for you and he has now fetched
the Scriptures.

2536
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:42,600
It took him five thousand and forty days.

2537
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:48,700
The number of chapters in the Scriptures is
five thousand and forty-eight.

2538
03:19:48,700 --> 03:19:54,061
Please allow him to make the return journey
in eight days.

2539
03:19:54,061 --> 03:19:56,580
Then the numbers will be the same.'

2540
03:19:56,580 --> 03:20:00,360
'That is a good idea,' said Buddha.

2541
03:20:00,360 --> 03:20:05,051
'I will make sure that it is done.'

2542
03:20:05,051 --> 03:20:12,601
Buddha then sent for eight of his messengers
and said to them, 'Use your magic powers and

2543
03:20:12,601 --> 03:20:16,021
carry Tripitaka back to the East.

2544
03:20:16,021 --> 03:20:20,250
When he has left the Scriptures, bring him
back here.

2545
03:20:20,250 --> 03:20:24,311
All of this must be done in eight days.

2546
03:20:24,311 --> 03:20:32,480
Buddha's messengers went immediately to put
Tripitaka and the pilgrims on a magic cloud.

2547
03:20:32,480 --> 03:20:43,040
And as the pilgrims flew away, they had little
idea of what was going to happen next.

2548
03:20:43,040 --> 03:20:46,012
CHAPTER SIX
The End of the Journey

2549
03:20:46,012 --> 03:20:49,980
'Hey!' said Pigsy.

2550
03:20:49,980 --> 03:20:53,140
'You have just made the others Buddhas.

2551
03:20:53,140 --> 03:20:58,350
Why am I not a Buddha too?'

2552
03:20:58,350 --> 03:21:03,820
Many Protectors had watched over Tripitaka
and his followers on their frightening but

2553
03:21:03,820 --> 03:21:06,970
wonderful journey to the West.

2554
03:21:06,970 --> 03:21:10,580
Now the Protectors appeared to Kuan-yin.

2555
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:14,670
'We wish to report that we have followed your
holy orders.

2556
03:21:14,670 --> 03:21:20,820
And, without his knowledge, we have protected
the young Priest of T'ang on his journey to

2557
03:21:20,820 --> 03:21:22,280
the West.'

2558
03:21:22,280 --> 03:21:29,600
'I would like to know,' said the Goddess,
'how the pilgrims behaved on their journey.'

2559
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:35,521
'They were brave, they never gave up, and
they never forgot the importance of their

2560
03:21:35,521 --> 03:21:36,521
work.

2561
03:21:36,521 --> 03:21:40,870
They had many problems along the way - too
many to tell.

2562
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:45,830
But we have a record of the most difficult
fights.'

2563
03:21:45,830 --> 03:21:51,510
The Protectors then read to the Goddess Kuan-yin
a list of all the fights that the pilgrims

2564
03:21:51,510 --> 03:21:53,040
had fought.

2565
03:21:53,040 --> 03:22:00,021
They had fought on their journey against animals,
humans and spirits.

2566
03:22:00,021 --> 03:22:07,030
Kuan-yin read the list slowly and carefully:
'Tripitaka falls into a hole and is attacked

2567
03:22:07,030 --> 03:22:12,420
by a tiger, but is saved by his follower Monkey...'

2568
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:18,650
She finished with Tripitaka losing his human
body when he stepped into the bottomless boat.

2569
03:22:18,650 --> 03:22:25,561
'In our religion, nine times nine is a very
important number.

2570
03:22:25,561 --> 03:22:29,030
You have listed eighty fights,' said the Goddess.

2571
03:22:29,030 --> 03:22:34,180
'That is one short of the holy number of eighty-one.

2572
03:22:34,180 --> 03:22:39,721
There has to be one more fight, so please
arrange it.'

2573
03:22:39,721 --> 03:22:46,011
When the Goddess had spoken, the Protectors
immediately stopped the magic wind that was

2574
03:22:46,011 --> 03:22:48,800
carrying the pilgrims through space.

2575
03:22:48,800 --> 03:22:55,181
Suddenly, and without any warning, the horse,
the Scriptures, the Master, Monkey, Sandy

2576
03:22:55,181 --> 03:23:00,490
and Pigsy all fell down to Earth.

2577
03:23:00,490 --> 03:23:05,751
Tripitaka looked very surprised to find himself
standing on the ground instead of flying through

2578
03:23:05,751 --> 03:23:07,841
the air.

2579
03:23:07,841 --> 03:23:10,440
Pigsy laughed and laughed.

2580
03:23:10,440 --> 03:23:16,920
'Well, you never know what is going to happen
next, do you?' he said.

2581
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:26,730
'One minute we are rushing at great speed;
the next minute we have both feet on the ground.'

2582
03:23:26,730 --> 03:23:30,760
Sandy said, 'I think that it was very thoughtful
of them.

2583
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:34,311
They probably thought we would like a rest.'

2584
03:23:34,311 --> 03:23:41,470
'Well,' said Monkey, 'if you sit without moving
for ten days, then surely you will speed down

2585
03:23:41,470 --> 03:23:44,610
nine waterfalls in one day.'

2586
03:23:44,610 --> 03:23:48,610
'That is enough rubbish!' said Tripitaka.

2587
03:23:48,610 --> 03:23:52,210
'Will you please try to find out where we
are.'

2588
03:23:52,210 --> 03:23:56,771
'I know, I know,' said Sandy, looking around.

2589
03:23:56,771 --> 03:24:00,460
'Listen to that sound of water.'

2590
03:24:00,460 --> 03:24:03,590
'It makes Sandy feel at home,' said Monkey.

2591
03:24:03,590 --> 03:24:05,700
'It must be...'

2592
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:09,601
Pigsy started to say, but Sandy interrupted
him.

2593
03:24:09,601 --> 03:24:17,910
'It is the River That Leads to Heaven and
this is the western riverbank,' Sandy said.

2594
03:24:17,910 --> 03:24:21,771
'I recognise it now,' said Tripitaka.

2595
03:24:21,771 --> 03:24:28,801
'On the other side is Mr Ch'en's farm, where
you saved the boy and the girl from the Great

2596
03:24:28,801 --> 03:24:29,801
King.

2597
03:24:29,801 --> 03:24:34,780
They were very grateful to us and wanted to
build a boat for us.

2598
03:24:34,780 --> 03:24:37,990
In the end, the turtle carried us across.

2599
03:24:37,990 --> 03:24:42,350
I remember that on this side there are no
houses at all.

2600
03:24:42,350 --> 03:24:45,780
How are we going to manage this time?'

2601
03:24:45,780 --> 03:24:52,771
'A trick like this from humans is to be expected,'
said Pigsy.

2602
03:24:52,771 --> 03:24:55,801
'But not from Buddha's own followers.

2603
03:24:55,801 --> 03:25:00,440
Buddha told them to take us straight back
to China.

2604
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:04,080
What do they mean by dropping us in the middle
of the journey?

2605
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:08,260
They have left us in a difficult situation.'

2606
03:25:08,260 --> 03:25:13,330
'I do not know what you two are complaining
about,' said Sandy.

2607
03:25:13,330 --> 03:25:16,730
'The Master is not a common mortal now.

2608
03:25:16,730 --> 03:25:21,021
We saw his earthly body go past us down the
Cloud River.

2609
03:25:21,021 --> 03:25:24,561
He will not sink into the water this time.

2610
03:25:24,561 --> 03:25:30,960
With all three of us to help him, he will
surely be able to get across.'

2611
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:33,271
Monkey smiled to himself.

2612
03:25:33,271 --> 03:25:37,351
'It is not going to be as easy as that,' he
said.

2613
03:25:37,351 --> 03:25:40,970
Why did Monkey say that it was not going to
be easy?

2614
03:25:40,970 --> 03:25:44,971
They had enough magic power to cross a thousand
rivers!

2615
03:25:44,971 --> 03:25:50,290
But Monkey knew that the number 'nine times
nine' had not yet been reached.

2616
03:25:50,290 --> 03:25:56,061
He knew that Buddha expected one more fight.

2617
03:25:56,061 --> 03:25:59,921
They walked along slowly, wondering what to
do.

2618
03:25:59,921 --> 03:26:08,051
Suddenly, they heard a voice saying, 'Priest
of T'ang, Priest of T'ang, come over here.'

2619
03:26:08,051 --> 03:26:13,460
As there was nobody on land and no boat on
the river, they were very surprised.

2620
03:26:13,460 --> 03:26:19,090
But suddenly a large white head appeared in
the water.

2621
03:26:19,090 --> 03:26:25,800
'Well,' called the turtle, 'I have been waiting
for you all this time.'

2622
03:26:25,800 --> 03:26:28,720
'We are very glad to meet you,' said Monkey.

2623
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:31,890
'Come a little closer.'

2624
03:26:31,890 --> 03:26:35,590
Once again, the turtle came out of the river.

2625
03:26:35,590 --> 03:26:41,800
Monkey led the white horse and then the pilgrims,
carrying their luggage, on to its back.

2626
03:26:41,800 --> 03:26:48,370
Pigsy sat behind its tail, Tripitaka stood
on one side of its head and Sandy on the other.

2627
03:26:48,370 --> 03:26:54,010
Monkey stood with one foot on its neck and
the other on its head.

2628
03:26:54,010 --> 03:26:56,671
Monkey cried, 'Time to go, Old Turtle!

2629
03:26:56,671 --> 03:26:57,671
Go gently!'

2630
03:26:57,671 --> 03:27:06,250
And the turtle swam easily through the endless
waters until evening came.

2631
03:27:06,250 --> 03:27:11,851
But when they were nearly at the far side,
the turtle suddenly asked Tripitaka an important

2632
03:27:11,851 --> 03:27:12,930
question.

2633
03:27:12,930 --> 03:27:20,870
'When I took you across last time, I asked
you to find out from Buddha how long I have

2634
03:27:20,870 --> 03:27:24,340
to wait before I become a human.

2635
03:27:24,340 --> 03:27:28,030
Did you remember to ask Buddha?'

2636
03:27:28,030 --> 03:27:35,021
Unfortunately, Tripitaka had been so busy
with his own problems - losing his mortal

2637
03:27:35,021 --> 03:27:41,140
body, going up the mountain, meeting Buddha
and all his followers, taking the Scriptures

2638
03:27:41,140 --> 03:27:46,620
- that he had had no time to think of anything
else.

2639
03:27:46,620 --> 03:27:52,440
Tripitaka did not want to tell a lie but he
did not know what to say.

2640
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:57,030
When no answer came, the turtle knew that
he had not asked.

2641
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:59,521
It was very annoyed.

2642
03:27:59,521 --> 03:28:02,820
The turtle did not think it had asked for
much.

2643
03:28:02,820 --> 03:28:05,890
And it was true, it had not.

2644
03:28:05,890 --> 03:28:11,940
'You have broken your promise!' said the turtle.

2645
03:28:11,940 --> 03:28:18,561
Without another word, it dived deep down into
the water, leaving the four pilgrims, the

2646
03:28:18,561 --> 03:28:22,470
horse and the holy Scriptures in the river.

2647
03:28:22,470 --> 03:28:27,350
But there was some good fortune in their misfortune.

2648
03:28:27,350 --> 03:28:33,410
First, Tripitaka was now immortal and could
not die under water.

2649
03:28:33,410 --> 03:28:40,011
Second, the white horse was really a dragon
and could swim very well.

2650
03:28:40,011 --> 03:28:45,370
Third, Pigsy and Sandy were both perfectly
happy in the water.

2651
03:28:45,370 --> 03:28:51,261
Monkey, of course, just leapt into the air
and helped his Master back to the land.

2652
03:28:51,261 --> 03:28:56,840
But the Scriptures and all the luggage were
wet, and as they climbed to the riverbank

2653
03:28:56,840 --> 03:28:59,530
a great wind began to blow.

2654
03:28:59,530 --> 03:29:04,480
The sky grew black and lightning lit up the
sky.

2655
03:29:04,480 --> 03:29:09,910
Tripitaka held the Scriptures close to him
while Sandy held the luggage and Pigsy held

2656
03:29:09,910 --> 03:29:12,350
the white horse.

2657
03:29:12,350 --> 03:29:18,240
Monkey knew that this storm was caused by
demons who were trying to steal the Scriptures.

2658
03:29:18,240 --> 03:29:23,990
The demons attacked all through the night,
stopping only when the sun began to come up.

2659
03:29:23,990 --> 03:29:28,950
And although nobody could see them, Monkey
hit out with his cudgel at them, holding it

2660
03:29:28,950 --> 03:29:35,141
in both hands and hitting first to the right
and then to the left.

2661
03:29:35,141 --> 03:29:41,900
Tripitaka, who was already wet from the storm,
was left shaking with fear.

2662
03:29:41,900 --> 03:29:47,390
'Monkey,' he asked in a shocked voice, 'what
does all this mean?'

2663
03:29:47,390 --> 03:29:50,990
'It is jealousy,' answered Monkey.

2664
03:29:50,990 --> 03:29:56,590
'The success of our journey has put jealousy
in the heart of every demon in Heaven and

2665
03:29:56,590 --> 03:30:02,591
on Earth, because our power is almost as great
as theirs now.

2666
03:30:02,591 --> 03:30:05,940
It is good that you kept the Scriptures close
to you.

2667
03:30:05,940 --> 03:30:12,460
That and my cudgel saved us from losing the
holy words.'

2668
03:30:12,460 --> 03:30:17,410
Tripitaka then understood and he thanked Monkey
for his protection.

2669
03:30:17,410 --> 03:30:23,851
When the sun was hotter, they dried their
clothes and the Scriptures on a rock.

2670
03:30:23,851 --> 03:30:29,200
Even today this rock is called The Rock Where
the Scriptures Were Dried.

2671
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:34,061
They also dried their shoes and clothes.

2672
03:30:34,061 --> 03:30:38,180
When they had almost finished, some workers
came past.

2673
03:30:38,180 --> 03:30:44,141
They said, 'Are you not the gentlemen who
crossed the river to fetch the Scriptures

2674
03:30:44,141 --> 03:30:45,400
from India?'

2675
03:30:45,400 --> 03:30:48,681
'That is right,' said Pigsy.

2676
03:30:48,681 --> 03:30:51,931
'How do you recognise us?'

2677
03:30:51,931 --> 03:30:55,761
'We are from Mr Ch'en's farm,' they answered.

2678
03:30:55,761 --> 03:30:58,221
'How far is it from here?'

2679
03:30:58,221 --> 03:30:59,540
Pigsy asked.

2680
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:07,030
'If you went about twenty kilometres south
from here, you would come to it,' they answered.

2681
03:31:07,030 --> 03:31:12,740
'Let's take the Scriptures and dry them at
the farm,' said Pigsy.

2682
03:31:12,740 --> 03:31:19,170
'If we go there, we can sit down comfortably
and get something to eat.'

2683
03:31:19,170 --> 03:31:22,061
'I am not going,' said Tripitaka.

2684
03:31:22,061 --> 03:31:25,190
'We can dry the scriptures very well here.'

2685
03:31:25,190 --> 03:31:29,551
But then Mr Ch'en himself appeared.

2686
03:31:29,551 --> 03:31:34,750
'I see that you have got the Scriptures,'
he said happily.

2687
03:31:34,750 --> 03:31:36,670
'Please come home with me!'

2688
03:31:36,670 --> 03:31:40,240
'Wait until our Scriptures are dry,' said
Monkey.

2689
03:31:40,240 --> 03:31:42,820
'Then we will go home with you.'

2690
03:31:42,820 --> 03:31:46,380
'I see that your clothes are wet too.

2691
03:31:46,380 --> 03:31:51,450
What has happened to you?' asked Mr Ch'en.

2692
03:31:51,450 --> 03:31:54,570
Tripitaka explained about the white turtle.

2693
03:31:54,570 --> 03:31:59,790
When he finished, Mr Ch'en again asked them
to follow him home.

2694
03:31:59,790 --> 03:32:04,041
In the end, Tripitaka accepted the kind offer.

2695
03:32:04,041 --> 03:32:09,910
But when they were collecting the Scriptures,
some of the paper stuck to the rock, and part

2696
03:32:09,910 --> 03:32:13,521
of the last sheet of paper was lost.

2697
03:32:13,521 --> 03:32:16,930
That is why it is incomplete today.

2698
03:32:16,930 --> 03:32:25,271
And still today you can find some writing
on the Rock Where the Scriptures Were Dried.

2699
03:32:25,271 --> 03:32:26,660
Tripitaka was very upset.

2700
03:32:26,660 --> 03:32:31,880
'We were not careful enough,' he said sadly.

2701
03:32:31,880 --> 03:32:35,160
'Don't get yourself so upset,' said Monkey.

2702
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:39,330
'These Scriptures are now as they are supposed
to be.

2703
03:32:39,330 --> 03:32:42,980
Heaven and Earth are not more complete.

2704
03:32:42,980 --> 03:32:48,521
The missing part is a secret and it is not
meant to be read by others.

2705
03:32:48,521 --> 03:32:51,040
You were as careful as you needed to be.

2706
03:32:51,040 --> 03:32:54,440
You did nothing wrong.'

2707
03:32:54,440 --> 03:33:01,530
Back at the farm, they were welcomed by everybody
there, young and old, and given all the best

2708
03:33:01,530 --> 03:33:04,240
wine and food.

2709
03:33:04,240 --> 03:33:10,760
As a Buddha, though, Tripitaka had lost his
taste for earthly food, and Monkey wanted

2710
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:12,730
only fruit.

2711
03:33:12,730 --> 03:33:18,070
Sandy ate very little, and even Pigsy ate
less than he had before.

2712
03:33:18,070 --> 03:33:26,181
'I do not know why I cannot eat more,' he
said sadly.

2713
03:33:26,181 --> 03:33:33,150
After they had eaten, Mr Ch'en said, 'We have
had some pictures painted of you.

2714
03:33:33,150 --> 03:33:38,340
We wanted to thank you for saving War Boy
and Much Gold.'

2715
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:43,090
Then War Boy and Much Gold came into the room
and bowed.

2716
03:33:43,090 --> 03:33:48,210
The pilgrims were invited to look at pictures
of themselves in the upstairs room of the

2717
03:33:48,210 --> 03:33:49,440
farm.

2718
03:33:49,440 --> 03:33:57,251
'Yours is very like you,' said Pigsy, pushing
his elbow gently into Monkey's side.

2719
03:33:57,251 --> 03:34:02,971
'I think yours is wonderfully like you too,'
said Sandy to Pigsy.

2720
03:34:02,971 --> 03:34:08,540
'But the Master's painting is a little too
handsome, really.'

2721
03:34:08,540 --> 03:34:12,420
'I think it is very good,' said Tripitaka.

2722
03:34:12,420 --> 03:34:18,721
The brothers Ch'en and all their workers prayed
to these pictures every day.

2723
03:34:18,721 --> 03:34:23,811
Since their prayers had started, there had
been no more damage from rain and everybody

2724
03:34:23,811 --> 03:34:25,851
had had plenty to eat.

2725
03:34:25,851 --> 03:34:31,110
'That is a gift from Heaven, not from us,'
said Monkey.

2726
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:34,150
'But we will certainly try to protect you.

2727
03:34:34,150 --> 03:34:39,080
You will have many children and those children
will have many children.

2728
03:34:39,080 --> 03:34:44,920
Your animals will grow fat, and the wind and
the rain will come at the right time of year.'

2729
03:34:44,920 --> 03:34:48,290
The people thanked him again.

2730
03:34:48,290 --> 03:34:52,190
And again they offered more fruit and cake.

2731
03:34:52,190 --> 03:34:56,210
'It is my bad luck,' said Pigsy.

2732
03:34:56,210 --> 03:35:04,130
'I used to be able to eat a lot, but in those
days no one pushed food on me.

2733
03:35:04,130 --> 03:35:11,630
Now I eat very little and everybody wants
to see me eat more!'

2734
03:35:11,630 --> 03:35:17,240
Because he did not want to insult the Ch'en
family, Pigsy managed to eat eight or nine

2735
03:35:17,240 --> 03:35:22,771
dishes of vegetables and twenty or thirty
cakes.

2736
03:35:22,771 --> 03:35:25,561
It was now late at night.

2737
03:35:25,561 --> 03:35:29,440
Tripitaka watched the Scriptures but he felt
nervous.

2738
03:35:29,440 --> 03:35:32,510
'I think we should leave,' he told Monkey.

2739
03:35:32,510 --> 03:35:37,891
'If we stay here too long, people will try
to get our secrets from us.'

2740
03:35:37,891 --> 03:35:40,440
'I agree with you,' said Monkey.

2741
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:46,351
'We had better go quietly while everyone is
still asleep.'

2742
03:35:46,351 --> 03:35:49,120
Pigsy was not a fool now.

2743
03:35:49,120 --> 03:35:53,190
Sandy and the horse clearly saw the need to
go too.

2744
03:35:53,190 --> 03:36:01,230
And as the pilgrims left the farm, a sweet-smelling
wind took them up and away on a cloud.

2745
03:36:01,230 --> 03:36:07,010
In the morning, the villagers came again with
offers of fruit and other special food.

2746
03:36:07,010 --> 03:36:13,010
It was a terrible surprise when they found
that the pilgrims had disappeared.

2747
03:36:13,010 --> 03:36:18,690
They looked everywhere for them, but after
a few hours they gave up hope.

2748
03:36:18,690 --> 03:36:23,240
'Why have you taken our living Buddha away?'

2749
03:36:23,240 --> 03:36:28,711
they cried to the God of Continuing Days.

2750
03:36:28,711 --> 03:36:34,891
Since that time, four times a year, the villagers
have performed a special dance in front of

2751
03:36:34,891 --> 03:36:38,660
the pictures of the Master and his followers.

2752
03:36:38,660 --> 03:36:44,761
The farm has been turned into a temple and
at every hour of every day there are people

2753
03:36:44,761 --> 03:36:47,561
praying on their knees there.

2754
03:36:47,561 --> 03:36:53,410
Some pray for better health, some pray for
protection on a journey and others pray for

2755
03:36:53,410 --> 03:36:56,410
their children's future.

2756
03:36:56,410 --> 03:37:02,120
Less than a day after they left Ch'en's farm,
the pilgrims could see in the distance the

2757
03:37:02,120 --> 03:37:04,650
towers of Ch'ang-an.

2758
03:37:04,650 --> 03:37:10,740
It was thirteen years and nine months since
Tripitaka had departed.

2759
03:37:10,740 --> 03:37:16,591
The Emperor had ordered a high tower to be
built outside the western gates and had named

2760
03:37:16,591 --> 03:37:19,920
it the Scripture Lookout Tower.

2761
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:26,960
And now, looking out, he suddenly saw the
whole western sky fill with a magic light.

2762
03:37:26,960 --> 03:37:32,200
A minute later, he noticed a sweet smell in
the wind.

2763
03:37:32,200 --> 03:37:36,860
The Protectors went with the pilgrims as far
as the gates of the city.

2764
03:37:36,860 --> 03:37:41,980
'We prefer to wait here for you,' they said
to Tripitaka.

2765
03:37:41,980 --> 03:37:45,650
'The people around here are very tricky.

2766
03:37:45,650 --> 03:37:48,490
We do not want them to know that we are here.

2767
03:37:48,490 --> 03:37:51,690
And there is no need for your followers to
go with you.

2768
03:37:51,690 --> 03:37:58,490
But you, Master, had better go at once and
give the Emperor the Scriptures.

2769
03:37:58,490 --> 03:38:05,181
We will wait for you here and then we will
all go back and report to Buddha's Holy Mountain.'

2770
03:38:05,181 --> 03:38:08,980
'That sounds fine,' said Monkey.

2771
03:38:08,980 --> 03:38:14,140
'But how can the Master carry the Scriptures
and who is going to lead his horse?

2772
03:38:14,140 --> 03:38:17,521
We had better go with him.'

2773
03:38:17,521 --> 03:38:22,970
'Kuan-yin promised Buddha that the whole journey
would take only eight days.

2774
03:38:22,970 --> 03:38:29,220
If you all go, Pigsy will be looking around
for food, and you will lose time,' said one

2775
03:38:29,220 --> 03:38:30,220
of the Protectors.

2776
03:38:30,220 --> 03:38:35,100
'How can you be so rude?' cried Pigsy.

2777
03:38:35,100 --> 03:38:38,190
'Why should I waste time here?

2778
03:38:38,190 --> 03:38:43,750
I am as anxious as anyone to get back to Buddha's
Holy Mountain.

2779
03:38:43,750 --> 03:38:50,100
The Master has become a Buddha and I intend
to become a Buddha too.

2780
03:38:50,100 --> 03:38:51,850
You wait here.

2781
03:38:51,850 --> 03:38:58,870
When we have given the Emperor the Scriptures,
I will go back with you and will get my reward.'

2782
03:38:58,870 --> 03:39:06,790
Then, with Pigsy carrying the luggage, Sandy
leading the horse and Monkey at Tripitaka's

2783
03:39:06,790 --> 03:39:11,040
side, they stopped in front of the tower.

2784
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:15,600
The Emperor and his ministers came down to
meet them.

2785
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:20,521
'So my dear brother has come at last!'

2786
03:39:20,521 --> 03:39:26,230
the Emperor cried, giving him a horse to ride
into the city.

2787
03:39:26,230 --> 03:39:32,570
When they were seated in the Great Hall, the
Scriptures were put in front of the Emperor.

2788
03:39:32,570 --> 03:39:37,390
Tripitaka told the story of how he arrived
at the Holy Mountain.

2789
03:39:37,390 --> 03:39:40,930
He told of the trick played by Buddha's two
followers.

2790
03:39:40,930 --> 03:39:47,440
He described how he had, in the end, got the
written Scriptures by giving his golden bowl

2791
03:39:47,440 --> 03:39:48,771
as a gift.

2792
03:39:48,771 --> 03:39:54,860
'There are, in total, five thousand and forty-eight
chapters,' he added.

2793
03:39:54,860 --> 03:39:59,511
The Emperor was very happy and he ordered
a banquet.

2794
03:39:59,511 --> 03:40:05,920
Suddenly, he noticed the three pilgrims, who
were sitting at the far end of the Hall.

2795
03:40:05,920 --> 03:40:08,340
He thought they looked unusual.

2796
03:40:08,340 --> 03:40:14,740
'I suppose these gentlemen are foreigners?'
said the Emperor.

2797
03:40:14,740 --> 03:40:22,650
'My oldest follower, named Monkey,' said Tripitaka,
'came from the Cave of the Water Curtain on

2798
03:40:22,650 --> 03:40:25,450
the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit.

2799
03:40:25,450 --> 03:40:31,230
Five hundred years ago he made trouble in
Heaven and Buddha sent him to a stone prison

2800
03:40:31,230 --> 03:40:33,091
under a mountain.

2801
03:40:33,091 --> 03:40:38,200
But he became a holy man with the help of
the Goddess Kuan-yin.

2802
03:40:38,200 --> 03:40:42,990
I was able to free him and take him with me
as my follower.

2803
03:40:42,990 --> 03:40:48,780
He protected me on the journey to India and
he helped me to get the Scriptures.

2804
03:40:48,780 --> 03:40:52,130
Without him, I would not be here now.

2805
03:40:52,130 --> 03:40:59,980
'My second follower, Pigsy, came from the
Cloud-Ladder Cave and was at the farm of Mr

2806
03:40:59,980 --> 03:41:02,680
Kao when I found him.

2807
03:41:02,680 --> 03:41:08,450
He has carried the luggage all through our
travels and he was very helpful when we had

2808
03:41:08,450 --> 03:41:10,440
to get across rivers.

2809
03:41:10,440 --> 03:41:16,500
'My third follower, Sandy, came from the River
of Sands.

2810
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:19,960
He too was brought to me by the Goddess Kuan-yin.

2811
03:41:19,960 --> 03:41:25,341
And our horse is not the one that you gave
to me.'

2812
03:41:25,341 --> 03:41:27,940
'Really?' said the Emperor.

2813
03:41:27,940 --> 03:41:30,000
'It looks the same to me.

2814
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:32,600
Why did you change horses?'

2815
03:41:32,600 --> 03:41:39,021
'Actually,' said Tripitaka, 'my first horse
was eaten by this one.

2816
03:41:39,021 --> 03:41:45,271
But Monkey went to Kuan-yin and the Goddess
explained that this horse was really a son

2817
03:41:45,271 --> 03:41:48,290
of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean.

2818
03:41:48,290 --> 03:41:54,980
He got into some trouble, but he took me to
the West and so his life was saved.

2819
03:41:54,980 --> 03:42:01,040
He has carried me well, over the most difficult
hills and mountains.

2820
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:07,600
On the way there, I rode on its back; on the
way home, it carried the Scriptures.

2821
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:13,110
As you can imagine, we are all very grateful
to him.'

2822
03:42:13,110 --> 03:42:16,340
'You have been served well.

2823
03:42:16,340 --> 03:42:22,870
Tell me,' said the Emperor, 'how far is it
to India?'

2824
03:42:22,870 --> 03:42:26,930
'I know only that the summer turned to winter
fourteen times.

2825
03:42:26,930 --> 03:42:31,810
There was no day when we did not ride over
hills or mountains.

2826
03:42:31,810 --> 03:42:38,181
Often we rode through large forests or crossed
great rivers and we passed through too many

2827
03:42:38,181 --> 03:42:42,080
countries to count.'

2828
03:42:42,080 --> 03:42:48,771
When the banquet was ready, the Emperor asked,
'Do your followers know how to behave at an

2829
03:42:48,771 --> 03:42:50,330
Emperor's banquet?'

2830
03:42:50,330 --> 03:42:54,440
'I am afraid that they do not,' said Tripitaka.

2831
03:42:54,440 --> 03:42:59,730
'They have spent their time mostly in rough
country conditions.'

2832
03:42:59,730 --> 03:43:02,810
'Don't worry,' said the Emperor.

2833
03:43:02,810 --> 03:43:05,730
'I will not blame them.

2834
03:43:05,730 --> 03:43:07,851
Tell them to come to the banquet.'

2835
03:43:07,851 --> 03:43:15,900
There was dancing and singing and music and
food at the banquet, and it was a very happy

2836
03:43:15,900 --> 03:43:17,190
day.

2837
03:43:17,190 --> 03:43:24,210
In the evening, when the meal ended, the pilgrims
went to Tripitaka's old temple in the woods.

2838
03:43:24,210 --> 03:43:29,090
There the priests welcomed them with a bow.

2839
03:43:29,090 --> 03:43:36,980
This time, inside the temple, Pigsy did not
shout for more food and Monkey and Sandy behaved

2840
03:43:36,980 --> 03:43:38,221
perfectly.

2841
03:43:38,221 --> 03:43:46,271
All three were now Spirits of Wisdom, and
it was not difficult for them to stay quiet.

2842
03:43:46,271 --> 03:43:49,561
When night came, they all went to sleep.

2843
03:43:49,561 --> 03:43:55,600
Early next morning, the Emperor woke and called
for his secretaries.

2844
03:43:55,600 --> 03:44:02,320
'All night I could not sleep because I was
thinking of good enough words to thank my

2845
03:44:02,320 --> 03:44:04,940
brother for his success.

2846
03:44:04,940 --> 03:44:12,740
I have now, in my head, a few sentences, although
they are nothing compared to the wisdom of

2847
03:44:12,740 --> 03:44:15,641
the Scriptures.'

2848
03:44:15,641 --> 03:44:22,021
He asked the secretaries to write down his
words, which later became known to all as

2849
03:44:22,021 --> 03:44:27,210
the Introduction to Buddha's Holy Teachings.

2850
03:44:27,210 --> 03:44:33,370
The Emperor then asked Tripitaka to read from
some of the Holy Scriptures in the holiest

2851
03:44:33,370 --> 03:44:35,830
temple in the city.

2852
03:44:35,830 --> 03:44:42,730
As the Scriptures were so valuable, the Emperor
ordered his secretaries to make copies, which

2853
03:44:42,730 --> 03:44:47,180
were later sent to every city in China.

2854
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:54,530
As Tripitaka started reading, he smelled the
sweet wind and the Protectors appeared in

2855
03:44:54,530 --> 03:44:57,190
the air above the pilgrims.

2856
03:44:57,190 --> 03:45:04,811
They said, 'You must all leave the Scriptures
and follow us to the West.'

2857
03:45:04,811 --> 03:45:11,771
At once Monkey and the others, including the
white horse, got up from the ground.

2858
03:45:11,771 --> 03:45:15,600
Tripitaka put down the Scripture that he had
started reading.

2859
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:19,320
He was lifted straight up to the Ninth Heaven.

2860
03:45:19,320 --> 03:45:25,380
The Emperor and his ministers bowed low to
the ground as they were carried away.

2861
03:45:25,380 --> 03:45:32,271
Later, all the people of the city prayed and
read the Great Scriptures, and their lives

2862
03:45:32,271 --> 03:45:35,000
were much better after that.

2863
03:45:35,000 --> 03:45:41,660
The four pilgrims and the white horse were
taken back to Buddha's Holy Mountain by the

2864
03:45:41,660 --> 03:45:42,840
Protectors.

2865
03:45:42,840 --> 03:45:50,500
There they found that their great journey
had taken just eight days.

2866
03:45:50,500 --> 03:45:57,440
On the Holy Mountain they and all the Gods
waited for Buddha.

2867
03:45:57,440 --> 03:46:03,590
When everyone was ready, Buddha appeared and
spoke first to Tripitaka.

2868
03:46:03,590 --> 03:46:12,440
'Holy priest,' he said, 'in a past life you
were close to me and you were called Golden

2869
03:46:12,440 --> 03:46:13,450
Tree.

2870
03:46:13,450 --> 03:46:20,480
But because you did not obey my teaching,
you had to start life again in the East.

2871
03:46:20,480 --> 03:46:27,180
Now you have obeyed me so well that I am making
you a Buddha.

2872
03:46:27,180 --> 03:46:31,271
Your title will be Buddha of Ability.

2873
03:46:31,271 --> 03:46:38,730
'Monkey, because you made trouble in Heaven,
you were put under the Mountain of Metal,

2874
03:46:38,730 --> 03:46:42,480
Wood, Water, Fire and Earth.

2875
03:46:42,480 --> 03:46:49,521
Fortunately, when your time there was finished,
you turned your heart to religion, to the

2876
03:46:49,521 --> 03:46:53,850
fight against wrongdoing and the fight for
good.

2877
03:46:53,850 --> 03:47:01,510
On your recent journey you have done so well
that I am making you a Buddha.

2878
03:47:01,510 --> 03:47:07,250
You will be the Buddha of Success in Difficult
Times.

2879
03:47:07,250 --> 03:47:13,450
'Pigsy, you were a soldier of the water armies
of Heaven.

2880
03:47:13,450 --> 03:47:18,690
But at a banquet you drank too much and insulted
a goddess.

2881
03:47:18,690 --> 03:47:25,510
And for this you were born again in the human
world, looking very much like an animal.

2882
03:47:25,510 --> 03:47:32,440
When you were living at the Cloud-Ladder Cave,
you found religion and offered your protection

2883
03:47:32,440 --> 03:47:35,421
to Tripitaka on his journey.

2884
03:47:35,421 --> 03:47:43,490
You are still greedy, but because you carried
the luggage all the way, I am now making you

2885
03:47:43,490 --> 03:47:47,150
the Keeper of the Holy Temple.'

2886
03:47:47,150 --> 03:47:49,811
'Hey!' said Pigsy.

2887
03:47:49,811 --> 03:47:52,870
'You have just made the others Buddhas.

2888
03:47:52,870 --> 03:47:55,380
Why am I not a Buddha too?'

2889
03:47:55,380 --> 03:48:04,040
'Because,' answered Buddha, 'your conversation
and appearance are still not fine enough and

2890
03:48:04,040 --> 03:48:06,240
you still eat too much.

2891
03:48:06,240 --> 03:48:14,040
But I have so many followers in the world
that you will get plenty to eat in your new

2892
03:48:14,040 --> 03:48:15,060
job.

2893
03:48:15,060 --> 03:48:19,790
You will have nothing to complain about.'

2894
03:48:19,790 --> 03:48:23,131
Pigsy knew that he had to accept his new job.

2895
03:48:23,131 --> 03:48:26,080
He did not say another word.

2896
03:48:26,080 --> 03:48:33,790
'Sandy, you were a great spirit, but at a
banquet you broke a dish of great value and

2897
03:48:33,790 --> 03:48:36,490
you were sent to the human world.

2898
03:48:36,490 --> 03:48:43,030
There you lived in the River of Sands and
you hungrily ate people.

2899
03:48:43,030 --> 03:48:46,271
But after that you found religion.

2900
03:48:46,271 --> 03:48:51,980
You promised to protect and help Tripitaka,
and you did.

2901
03:48:51,980 --> 03:49:00,140
Because of this, I am lifting you high among
us and giving you the title of Golden-Bodied

2902
03:49:00,140 --> 03:49:02,850
Soldier.'

2903
03:49:02,850 --> 03:49:04,000
Sandy bowed.

2904
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:08,760
Happily, he accepted his new title.

2905
03:49:08,760 --> 03:49:11,670
Then Buddha turned to the white horse.

2906
03:49:11,670 --> 03:49:19,570
'You,' he said, 'were a child of the Dragon
King of the Western Ocean, but you disobeyed

2907
03:49:19,570 --> 03:49:24,300
your father and were guilty of bad behaviour.

2908
03:49:24,300 --> 03:49:28,570
Fortunately, you found religion.

2909
03:49:28,570 --> 03:49:35,641
Because you carried Tripitaka to the West,
and the Holy Scriptures on the return journey,

2910
03:49:35,641 --> 03:49:39,310
you too must have your reward.

2911
03:49:39,310 --> 03:49:46,641
From this day, you will be one of the eight
Heavenly Dragons.'

2912
03:49:46,641 --> 03:49:50,530
The white horse made a sign to show how grateful
it was.

2913
03:49:50,530 --> 03:49:55,851
It was led to the back of the Holy Mountain,
where there was the Pool of Magic Dragons,

2914
03:49:55,851 --> 03:49:59,021
and it was pushed into the pool.

2915
03:49:59,021 --> 03:50:06,570
After a short time, it began to change shape
and its coat began to change to a golden colour.

2916
03:50:06,570 --> 03:50:13,640
Its four feet rested on the clouds and then
it flew up out of the pool.

2917
03:50:13,640 --> 03:50:18,751
It was now changed from a horse to a magic
dragon.

2918
03:50:18,751 --> 03:50:24,980
'Master,' said Monkey to Tripitaka, 'I am
now a Buddha, like you.

2919
03:50:24,980 --> 03:50:29,440
I should not have to wear a cap so that you
can control me.'

2920
03:50:29,440 --> 03:50:36,061
'It was put on you,' said Tripitaka, 'at a
time when you knew nothing.

2921
03:50:36,061 --> 03:50:38,440
Then we needed to control you.

2922
03:50:38,440 --> 03:50:42,620
Now you are a Buddha and it has gone.

2923
03:50:42,620 --> 03:50:45,271
Feel your head and you will see.

2924
03:50:45,271 --> 03:50:49,590
It is not there now.'

2925
03:50:49,590 --> 03:50:52,570
Monkey put his hand on his head.

2926
03:50:52,570 --> 03:50:55,900
Tripitaka was right; the cap had gone.

2927
03:50:55,900 --> 03:51:01,311
A grateful smile spread across his face.

2928
03:51:01,311 --> 03:51:05,940
All the spirits of Heaven watched as Tripitaka,
Monkey,

2929
03:51:05,940 --> 03:51:12,521
Pigsy, Sandy and the horse received their
new, holy titles.

2930
03:51:12,521 --> 03:51:19,311
While they went to their places in the Great
Hall, many loud voices began to pray to them.

2931
03:51:19,311 --> 03:51:22,440
They were accepted with open arms.

2932
03:51:22,440 --> 03:51:32,480
And from that day, Pigsy did not shout for
more food and Monkey and Sandy behaved perfectly.

2933
03:51:32,480 --> 03:51:35,320
The reason for this was simple.

2934
03:51:35,320 --> 03:51:40,960
All three had received the greatest of gifts
- wisdom.

2935
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:49,101
I give this, my book, to you, dear reader,
so you can understand the beauty of Buddha's

2936
03:51:49,101 --> 03:51:50,140
Land.

2937
03:51:50,140 --> 03:51:56,030
It will be a reward for kindness, and it will
help with the suffering of the lost souls

2938
03:51:56,030 --> 03:51:57,870
of this world.

2939
03:51:57,870 --> 03:52:05,280
I would like to think that my readers will
turn their hearts towards the True Way, and

2940
03:52:05,280 --> 03:52:09,540
will be born again in the World of True Happiness.
