00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,630
CHAPTER ONE
The visitor

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,970
The gardener glanced up from the roses.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,150
The man across the road was still there - standing
on the footpath and looking up at the house.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,070
What did he want?

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,010
The man had a tattoo on his arm and his hair
was long.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,750
He didn't look like a visitor.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,570
No, not a visitor to this house - this enormous
house with its carefully kept gardens and

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:38,219
its river views, its swimming pool and tennis
court and four-car garage.

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,780
No, the visitors to this house were carefully
chosen.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,699
The gardener himself had only been inside
once, and that was only into the kitchen.

11
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,149
He snipped off another dead rose.

12
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,820
He heard the sound of footsteps.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,940
The man with the tattoo had crossed the road
and was walking up the path to the house.

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,250
The gardener quickly moved his position so
that he could see the front door.

15
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,350
He snipped off another dead rose.

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,281
'This will be good,' he said to himself.

17
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:18,250
Whatever the man wanted, he wouldn't get past
Mrs Balfour.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,890
She was fierce.

19
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,990
The man rang the doorbell.

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,880
A moment later, Mrs Balfour answered.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,890
The gardener was too far away to hear the
conversation but he could see the man holding

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,920
out a book towards her.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,200
Mrs Balfour raised her voice.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,720
Then suddenly she stopped.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,159
She disappeared into the house and left the
man standing there.

26
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,040
A few minutes later, she returned and let
the man into the house.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,280
The gardener, surprised, snipped his finger
by mistake.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,490
'Agh!' he said, and went to wash the cut under
the garden tap.

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,420
'I knew I should have worn gloves.'

30
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,910
But his hands got so sweaty in the heat.

31
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,490
He took his finger out from under the stream
of water.

32
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,530
It was only a small cut.

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,450
It would stop bleeding soon.

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,280
He turned off the tap and pressed his thumb
over the cut.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,460
He heard shouting coming from the house.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,220
The front door opened and Mrs Balfour pushed
the man with the tattoo out.

37
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,750
The man turned and looked at an upstairs window.

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,830
He shook the book in the air.

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,060
'I'll find her!' he shouted.

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,600
'And she'll remember.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,300
She'll remember.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,910
And then the whole world will know the truth!'

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,650
CHAPTER TWO
Rottnest Island - here we come!

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,800
Becky waited in the car park near the dock.

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,870
She looked at her watch.

46
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,300
The ferry was due to leave in ten minutes.

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,020
Where were they?

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,260
'Becky!'

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,080
She turned towards the voice and then burst
out laughing.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,280
'How many bags have you got?'

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
she said.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,440
'We're only going for two weeks.

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,740
You'll sink the ferry!'

54
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,340
She watched as her two best friends, Amber
and Natalie, struggled towards her.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,170
They had two large bags each and, behind them,
Natalie's father carried two more.

56
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,690
'Ah, Rebecca,' he said, looking at the one
bag and box of food at Becky's feet, 'I'm

57
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,110
glad to see there's going to be one sensible
person on this holiday.'

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,230
'Da-ad,' complained Natalie.

59
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,370
Becky laughed.

60
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,800
'Come on,' she said, 'or we'll miss the boat.'

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,890
They all hurried over to the dock to join
the line of people moving onto the ferry.

62
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,590
Natalie's father helped the girls to load
their bags on the front of the boat and then

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,980
went back onto the dock.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,750
He waved to them and called, 'Be good,' then
turned and walked away.

65
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,760
The girls looked at each other and grinned.

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,540
'Our first holiday by ourselves!' said Amber,
hugging the other two.

67
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,090
'No parents, no teachers...'

68
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,640
'Just us,' said Becky.

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,690
'Hey,' said Natalie, 'let's see if we can
get a seat outside.'

70
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,690
She led the way to the back of the ferry and
they found three seats.

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,250
'We'll have the sun on our backs.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,250
Perfect.'

73
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,940
The boat began to move.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,970
'Rottnest Island - here we come!' said Amber,
and the girls grinned at each other again.

75
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,050
Soon the ferry was out into the deeper waters
of the Indian Ocean.

76
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,820
Becky stood and went to look over the side
of the boat.

77
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,010
The wind whipped her long brown hair about
her face.

78
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,830
She pulled her hat down tight on her head.

79
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:33,130
She looked at the sparkling water below her
and the clear blue sky above and felt a wonderful

80
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,770
sense of freedom.

81
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,980
She had studied so hard during her final year
of high school.

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,770
But that was all over now.

83
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,280
She was free.

84
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,630
Well, until university started...

85
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,350
'Excuse me, dear.'

86
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,110
Becky turned.

87
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,860
An elderly woman in a bright yellow shirt
held an equally bright yellow pamphlet out

88
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,030
towards her.

89
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,720
'I'm one of Rottnest's voluntary guides,'
said the woman.

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,680
'We do tours on the island.'

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,700
The boat rolled on the waves and she pushed
the pamphlet at Becky.

92
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:23,030
'Here's some information and a list of tours
if you're interested.'

93
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,540
'Oh, thanks.'

94
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,700
Becky took the yellow paper and the woman
moved away.

95
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Becky looked at the pamphlet.

96
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:40,280
Just 19 kilometres off the coast of Fremantle
lies Rottnest Island, one of Western Australia's

97
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,530
favourite holiday places.

98
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,020
The Dutch explorer, Willem de Vlamingh, landed
on the island in 1696.

99
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:55,150
He thought the quokkas (small wallabies that
live on the island) were rats.

100
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:03,200
He named the island 'Rats Nest Island'; or
in Dutch, 'Rottenest...'

101
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,020
Becky pushed the pamphlet into her pocket.

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,900
It was just for tourists.

103
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,590
'What's that?' asked Natalie, coming to stand
beside her.

104
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,040
'Oh, just some stuff about tours on the island.'

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,400
'I can't wait to get over there,' said Natalie.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,580
'Two weeks lying on a beach.

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Heaven!'

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,680
Amber came to join them.

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,080
She looked pale.

110
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,639
'How long until we get there?'

111
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,230
she asked.

112
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,919
Becky glanced at her watch.

113
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,240
'Ten minutes.'

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,850
'I'm feeling a bit sick,' said Amber.

115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,810
'Look at something that's not moving,' suggested
Becky.

116
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,710
'You'll be okay.'

117
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,730
Amber didn't seem too sure.

118
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,160
'Hey, look!' said Natalie.

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,580
'There's the lighthouse near Pinky Beach!'

120
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,350
All three girls looked out beyond the front
of the boat.

121
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,550
They could see the lighthouse on the north
end of the island.

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,190
'We're nearly there!'

123
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,340
And as they got closer and closer, the water
beneath them became calm and light green and

124
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,930
clear.

125
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,580
And soon they could see the white, white sand
on the beach and the little ochre-coloured

126
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,690
cottages between the tea trees along the shore.

127
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:30,910
Gradually everything became larger and larger
until, finally, they were there.

128
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:36,390
The ferry came slowly up to the jetty at the
main settlement, the small village on Thomson

129
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,390
Bay.

130
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:43,520
There were two other smaller settlements on
the north side of the island - at Longreach

131
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,050
Bay and Geordie Bay - but the girls were to
stay at the main settlement.

132
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:56,541
There they would be close to the General Store,
the few tourist shops and - best of all - the

133
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,180
famous bakery.

134
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,570
Standing among the crowd on the jetty, with
her feet firmly on solid ground, Amber began

135
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,900
to feel better.

136
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,380
'Shall we hire our bikes before we go to the
cottage?'

137
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,850
she asked the others.

138
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,050
'The luggage might not be delivered for ages.'

139
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,480
The girls had clearly marked their luggage
and it would be delivered to their cottage

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,730
- T179.

141
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,610
They collected the cottage key from the Tourist
Information building at the end of the jetty

142
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,050
and walked into the settlement.

143
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,520
Apart from a few cars for the people who worked
on the island and a bus service, no vehicles

144
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,990
were allowed on Rottnest.

145
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,430
Everyone used bicycles.

146
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,620
'This seat's uncomfortable,' said Becky, trying
out a bike.

147
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,500
The Bike Hire building - like everything else
in the settlement - was only a short walk

148
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
from the jetty.

149
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,430
There were rows and rows of bright blue bikes.

150
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,190
People walked among them looking for something
suitable.

151
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,560
'Mine's okay,' said Natalie.

152
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,120
'Try one of these over here.'

153
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,490
Soon all three girls had chosen a bike and
paid for two weeks' hire.

154
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,700
Minutes later, they were riding down a sandy
road looking at the ochre cottages on either

155
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,850
side of them.

156
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,830
The road ran parallel to the shore.

157
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,050
The cottages to their right faced the road
while those on their left faced the sea and

158
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,950
had their backs to the road.

159
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,450
Becky suddenly pointed.

160
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,950
'Look, T179.

161
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,690
There it is!'

162
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,170
'Oh, perfect!' said Natalie.

163
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,260
'It's on the sea side.'

164
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,040
There was a high wall at the back of the cottage.

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,880
The girls jumped off their bikes, leaned them
against the wall and opened the gate.

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,750
'The luggage is here!' said Natalie, going
first into the little backyard.

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,020
'That was quick.'

168
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,960
She turned to face the others.

169
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,760
'Who's got the key?'

170
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,580
Becky took the key out of her pocket and opened
the back door.

171
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,050
'Well, here we are,' she said, as they all
went in.

172
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,980
'Home, sweet home.'

173
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,260
The cottage had just three rooms - the kitchen
in the centre, in which they were standing,

174
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,560
and two bedrooms.

175
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,940
Through the windows at the front, the girls
could see the blue-green water of Thomson

176
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
Bay.

177
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,540
They hugged each other.

178
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,060
Then Amber suddenly broke away and ran from
one bedroom to the other, trying out the beds.

179
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,490
Becky and Natalie joined the race.

180
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,370
'I'm having this bed,' called Amber.

181
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,839
'I'm having this one in here,' called Becky.

182
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,779
'Where am I going to sleep?' asked Natalie.

183
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,470
'You have that one.'

184
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,310
The girls laughed and unpacked their clothes
and the sun sparkled on the waters of the

185
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,480
bay.

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
CHAPTER THREE
West End

187
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,160
The next morning Becky and Amber sat on the
front verandah of the cottage eating breakfast.

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,620
A low wall ran around the small front yard
and beyond that was the beach.

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,740
But the girls weren't looking at the water.

190
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,310
The little wooden gate in the wall was open
and two quokkas had wandered in.

191
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:42,779
'They're so sweet,' said Amber, kneeling down
and holding out her hand.

192
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,350
The smaller one put its nose to her fingers
hoping for some food.

193
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,180
'Oh, look at his little face.'

194
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,149
Just then, Natalie came out onto the verandah
and the quokkas jumped back towards the gate.

195
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,410
'So, what's the plan?' asked Natalie.

196
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,600
She sat on the low wall that divided their
cottage from the one next door.

197
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,870
'Well,' said Becky, 'we ride out past Geordie
Bay to West End.

198
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,600
Maybe we can have a swim at Parakeet Bay on
the way.

199
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,750
And then we come back on the road on the south
side of the island.'

200
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,560
'We'll need supplies from the bakery,' said
Natalie.

201
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,910
'Of course,' grinned Becky.

202
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,589
'If we leave soon, we should be back by about
one o'clock.'

203
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,750
Suddenly a window in the cottage next door
opened and Natalie turned to see the face

204
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,240
of a young man with sandy-coloured hair.

205
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,390
He smiled at her.

206
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,940
She turned and stood and walked back to the
other girls, her eyes wide.

207
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,941
'There's a really good-looking guy next door,'
she whispered.

208
00:13:55,941 --> 00:14:03,450
There was a solid wall at the end of the verandah,
so Becky and Amber couldn't see into the cottage.

209
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,209
But they heard the front door open.

210
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:13,400
Two young men came out into the yard - one
with sandy hair and one with dark hair.

211
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,790
They looked across at the girls.

212
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,870
The dark-haired one spoke first.

213
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,870
'Hi.

214
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,020
How are you going?'

215
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,110
'Hi,' said the girls.

216
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,210
'We've just arrived,' said the other boy.

217
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,260
'Have you been here long?'

218
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,360
'We arrived yesterday,' said Natalie.

219
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,000
'Yes, Sunday.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,030
Yesterday,' repeated Amber.

221
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,980
'We're here for two weeks.'

222
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,160
'Oh, good.'

223
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,820
The dark-haired one smiled.

224
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,330
'My name's Dominic, by the way.

225
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,649
And this is Richard.'

226
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,470
'I'm Amber.'

227
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,470
'Natalie.'

228
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,470
'Becky.'

229
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,470
'Right.

230
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,470
Well.

231
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,950
We'd, um, better go and unpack.

232
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,270
We'll probably see you around.'

233
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,010
Dominic gave a quick wave and the two boys
disappeared behind the verandah wall and into

234
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,550
their cottage.

235
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,470
Amber signaled to Becky and Natalie and they
all went inside too.

236
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,230
'They're both good-looking,' said Amber once
the door was safely shut.

237
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,500
'This holiday just gets better and better.'

238
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,640
'I like the dark-haired one,' said Natalie.

239
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
She turned to Becky.

240
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,420
'What about you?'

241
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:42,399
Becky paused and then said very calmly, 'You
do realise, don't you, that were still in

242
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
our pyjamas?'

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,779
Becky was the first to be dressed and ready
for their ride around the island.

244
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,200
She took her towel and a bag out to her bike.

245
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,720
She wheeled the bicycle out of the back gate,
leaned it against the wall and fastened her

246
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,590
bag on the back of the bike.

247
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,899
She folded her towel and put it on the seat.

248
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,870
With more than two hours' riding ahead of
her, she would need that for comfort.

249
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,520
She heard voices behind her and turned around.

250
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,880
A group of older women were on the verandah
of the cottage opposite.

251
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,720
'Hello,' she said.

252
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,670
'Hello, love,' replied one of the women, coming
forward to hang a wet towel on the back of

253
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,720
a chair.

254
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,540
'Going for a swim?'

255
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,950
'No, a long ride around the island.'

256
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,350
'All the way to West End?'

257
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,070
Becky nodded.

258
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,870
The woman turned to her companions on the
verandah.

259
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,300
'We haven't done that for a few years, have
we, girls?'

260
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Becky smiled.

261
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,350
These 'girls' looked about fifty or sixty
years old.

262
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,300
The women smiled at Becky.

263
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,420
'Do you come to Rottnest often?'

264
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
she asked.

265
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,310
'We've been coming every year since 1991,'
the woman with the towel answered.

266
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,100
'Well, apart from Ruth.'

267
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,059
She pointed at a woman with very short grey
hair.

268
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,059
'She's new.

269
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,309
We've only known her for ten years.'

270
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,309
The women laughed.

271
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,999
'Of course, we all came here when we were
children too.

272
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,220
Oh, hello.'

273
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,339
Natalie and Amber were wheeling their bikes
out onto the road.

274
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,689
'Hello,' they said.

275
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:28,039
'Ready?' asked Becky.

276
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,039
'Yeah.'

277
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,460
'Well, it was nice talking to you,' Becky
said to the woman.

278
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,659
'Bye.'

279
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,289
The women on the verandah waved to the girls
as they set off.

280
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:45,919
After a visit to the bakery for supplies,
the girls rode to Parakeet Bay on the north

281
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,149
side of the island.

282
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:54,019
They stopped there for a swim in the calm,
clear green water and then sat on the warm

283
00:17:54,019 --> 00:18:00,359
sand and ate the cream buns they had bought,
before continuing on their journey.

284
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,009
The further they got from the settlement,
the fewer people they saw.

285
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,220
Riding down the road through Narrow Neck - the
narrowest part of the island, where once the

286
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,840
sea had flowed and formed two islands instead
of one - they saw no one.

287
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,649
The low tea trees were windswept and it was
dry and hot.

288
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:28,639
As Becky came down a hill, a black snake quickly
crossed the road in front of her bike.

289
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:32,590
She pointed and shouted back at the others,
'Snake!'

290
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,880
Amber gave a short scream and Becky and Natalie
laughed.

291
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,340
Finally, they came to the end of the road
at West End.

292
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,150
They dropped their bikes on the ground and
drank thirstily from their water bottles.

293
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,860
The road ended on high ground.

294
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,340
There was no pretty bay or pure white sand
here.

295
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,119
Only steep, jagged rocks and the windswept
sea below.

296
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,399
Suddenly the wind caught Amber's hat and it
flew down onto the rocks.

297
00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:05,899
'Oh, no.

298
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:08,429
I love that hat,' she cried.

299
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,409
I've got to get it back.'

300
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:12,409
'Don't be crazy.

301
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,809
You can't climb down there.

302
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,379
It's too dangerous,' said Natalie.

303
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:23,630
The girls went to the edge and looked at the
rocks below.

304
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,659
Suddenly Amber gasped and covered her mouth
with her hand.

305
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,490
'What is it?' said Natalie.

306
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,320
'Oh my God!' said Becky.

307
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,609
She had seen it too.

308
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:42,450
To their right, down on a jagged shelf of
rock, lay a man.

309
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,929
There was blood on his face.

310
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:54,359
'Is he dead?' whispered Amber.

311
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,000
CHAPTER FOUR
The body on the rocks

312
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,729
Becky called out but the man didn't move.

313
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,739
'I'm going down there,' she said.

314
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,220
'But it's too dangerous,' cried Natalie.

315
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,779
'You'll get swept off the rocks by a wave
or something.'

316
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:16,919
'Well, we can't just leave him there, can
we?' replied Becky, putting her water bottle

317
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,889
in the long pocket of her shorts.

318
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,539
'Maybe he's still alive.

319
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,700
Look, someone needs to ride back to the settlement
and tell the police.

320
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,799
I'll try to climb down to him that way.'

321
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,549
She pointed to some rocks that led to the
shelf below.

322
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,639
'I'll be careful.'

323
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:37,809
'Well, if you're going down there, I'm staying
here too,' said Natalie.

324
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,269
'Amber can go back to get help.'

325
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:43,159
Amber looked at her, alarmed.

326
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,820
'I'm not riding back there alone,' she said.

327
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,320
And I'm not staying here!'

328
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,570
Becky put her hand on Natalie's arm.

329
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,059
'I'll be fine,' she said.

330
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,009
'You go with Amber.'

331
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:01,070
'I knew we should have brought our mobiles,'
said Amber as she and Natalie picked up their

332
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,070
bikes.

333
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,200
'Are you sure about this?'

334
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,429
Natalie said to Becky.

335
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,639
'Yes.

336
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,850
Go!'

337
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,979
she replied and she started to climb down
the rocks.

338
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,639
'Be careful,' called Natalie.

339
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:20,879
And seconds later, they were gone.

340
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,289
Becky looked for a way down to the rock shelf.

341
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:30,070
She judged it to be no more than ten metres
below her, but the rocks weren't made for

342
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,070
climbing.

343
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,100
They stuck out towards the sky with nasty
sharp points.

344
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,360
There were no flat places to put your feet.

345
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,910
She didn't want to fall forward and meet the
same fate as the man below.

346
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:50,330
Slowly, slowly, she worked her way down to
him.

347
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:56,649
Finally getting onto the jagged rock shelf,
she could see immediately that he was dead.

348
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,879
His eyes were open wide, staring at the sky.

349
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:05,690
His skin was a strange purple colour.

350
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,919
She went closer.

351
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,179
The angle of one of his legs was all wrong.

352
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:13,419
It looked broken.

353
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,980
Flies moved around the cuts on his head and
his mouth was open.

354
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,059
There was a tattoo of a snake on his arm.

355
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,880
Becky turned away and looked at the rocks
above.

356
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,110
He must have fallen.

357
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,750
Perhaps he was climbing and he fell.

358
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,070
She didn't know what to do.

359
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,970
It didn't seem right to leave him alone.

360
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,320
She moved a bit away from him, sat down and
looked at her watch.

361
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,269
It would probably be another three- quarters
of an hour before the police arrived.

362
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:54,129
Hugging her knees, she sat there watching
the waves break on the rocks.

363
00:22:54,129 --> 00:23:00,559
Although the sun was shining fiercely, she
was in the shadow of the rocks above her and

364
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,610
she felt cold.

365
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,269
She had never seen a dead body before.

366
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:09,450
She forced herself to look at the man again.

367
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,799
And she noticed something else.

368
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,649
Slowly she stood up and went over to him.

369
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,940
She knelt beside him and looked at his neck.

370
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,360
His skin was a strange colour, but there was
something else.

371
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,239
Definite marks on his neck.

372
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,919
As if...

373
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,669
Becky stood up quickly.

374
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:36,889
Could this be murder?

375
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:41,119
She looked at the wild place around her and
felt frightened.

376
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,809
The police would be here soon.

377
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:45,679
She didn't need to stay with the body.

378
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,070
She began to climb back up the rocks.

379
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,651
It was easier going up than it had been going
down and it wasn't long before she was at

380
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,320
the top.

381
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,580
She took a drink from her water bottle and
put it back in her bag on her bike.

382
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,630
She looked at the bike and then looked around
her.

383
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,539
Where was the man's bike?

384
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,549
How did he get here?

385
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,690
It was a long walk.

386
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,239
Did someone drive him?

387
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,220
There were few cars on the island.

388
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,519
She searched in the bushes at the side of
the road and soon found it - a bicycle from

389
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,070
the island's Bike Hire, exactly the same as
hers.

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,799
She didn't touch it.

391
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,220
Coming back out onto the road, she heard a
car.

392
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,570
Seconds later, a police van appeared.

393
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,570
It stopped and two officers got out.

394
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,429
'Hello,' said one.

395
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,379
'I'm Sergeant Tom Barker.

396
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:45,720
Are you Becky?'

397
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Becky nodded.

398
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,029
'You were quick,' she said.

399
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:54,309
'Your friends found someone with a mobile
phone and called us from Geordie Bay.

400
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,929
They asked me to tell you they've gone back
to the cottage.'

401
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,929
'Oh,' said Becky.

402
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:03,509
She pointed in the direction of the body.

403
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,499
'I've been down there.'

404
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:07,749
She paused.

405
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:09,919
'He's dead.'

406
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,909
The officers glanced at one another.

407
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:15,210
'Are you okay?' asked the sergeant.

408
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,210
'Yeah.

409
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,010
But there's something else.'

410
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,570
The officers waited.

411
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,929
'I think...

412
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:27,539
Well, I think he may have been murdered.'

413
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,739
The officers stared at her.

414
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,999
'There's a bike in there.'

415
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,509
Becky pointed into the bushes.

416
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,070
'It's probably his.

417
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,019
I didn't touch it.'

418
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,119
What the officers said then to each other
Becky didn't hear because, at that moment,

419
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,549
a rescue helicopter flew over them and hung
in the air above the rocks.

420
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:57,760
The men went back to the van and the sergeant
shouted into the police radio.

421
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,659
Becky watched the helicopter.

422
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,450
Then the other officer came over to her.

423
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,379
'There's nothing more you can do here,' he
said loudly.

424
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,649
'Are you all right to ride back to the settlement
on your own?'

425
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:12,379
'Yes,' said Becky.

426
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:19,130
'We'll need to get a statement from you and
your friends,' the officer continued.

427
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,080
'Can you come to the police station in the
main settlement this afternoon?'

428
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,239
'Okay,' she said.

429
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,000
The officer smiled and went back to the van.

430
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,249
From the helicopter, a man on a rope was dropping
slowly down onto the rocks below.

431
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:41,369
Becky picked up her bike and rode away.

432
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:45,869
Mid-afternoon, the girls walked to the police
station.

433
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:51,299
They gave their statements separately - Becky
took longer than the others - and then went

434
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:52,299
home.

435
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:57,700
They lay on the beach in front of their cottage
in the late afternoon sun.

436
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,429
Amber and Natalie wanted to keep on talking
about the body on the rocks.

437
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:06,950
But Becky just wanted to forget about it.

438
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,090
That night in bed, however, she couldn't escape.

439
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,799
It was grey.

440
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,419
It was all grey.

441
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:22,759
She sat on the rock shelf, grey water sweeping
over her feet.

442
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:26,149
The body floated in on the waves.

443
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:28,309
It pushed up against her.

444
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:31,799
She wanted to stand up but she couldn't move.

445
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,380
The tattooed snake on the man's arm lifted
its head and came towards her.

446
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,240
She gasped.

447
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,179
Now she was on her bike, riding fast.

448
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,479
She looked behind her and gasped.

449
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,489
The snake was following her.

450
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,340
She couldn't get away.

451
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,059
And then the man's face, covered in blood,
came towards her.

452
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,220
The staring eyes.

453
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,409
The open mouth.

454
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:02,409
And he smiled.

455
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:08,609
Becky woke in a cold sweat.

456
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,129
CHAPTER FIVE
The boys next door

457
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,139
'They're out there.

458
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:19,969
They're out there,' gasped Amber, running
in through the front door of the cottage the

459
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:21,090
next morning.

460
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,369
'Quick, give me the broom.'

461
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:31,080
Natalie reached out of the backdoor, got the
broom and gave it to Amber.

462
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,700
Then she joined Becky at the front window
and they watched Amber go back outside; Amber

463
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,200
moved slowly down the front yard towards the
gate, sweeping the, sand off the path.

464
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,299
'Who cares about sand on their path at Rottnest?'
said Becky.

465
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,669
'They'll think she's crazy.'

466
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:56,990
Amber looked up towards the cottage next door.

467
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,200
'Oh, hello,' she said.

468
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,789
She leaned on the broom.

469
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:06,219
'I didn't see you there.'

470
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,149
Natalie rolled her eyes at Becky.

471
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:15,389
They both laughed, then quickly hid behind
the curtains as Richard and Dominic appeared.

472
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:21,970
'Listen,' said Dominic, 'we thought we might
play tennis this afternoon.

473
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,610
About one o'clock.

474
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,469
Do you and your friends want to join us?'

475
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,369
Amber nodded.

476
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,369
'Okay.'

477
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,859
She smiled at the boys.

478
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:37,489
'I mean, I'll have to ask the others, but
they'll probably say yes.

479
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:40,639
I mean, I'm sure they'll say yes.

480
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:41,679
Yes.

481
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,710
Great.

482
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,789
What time?'

483
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:49,719
Natalie made a face at Becky then looked through
the window again.

484
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:54,130
Richard smiled showing a row of perfect white
teeth.

485
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,330
'One o'clock,' he said.

486
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,039
'At the tennis courts?'

487
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,629
'Okay,' said Amber.

488
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:01,629
'Great.

489
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,080
See you there.'

490
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,219
The girls decided to spend the morning at
The Basin, a swimming place in a small bay

491
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:12,519
about half a kilometre from the settlement.

492
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,519
It was called The Basin because it was a large
round hole in a rock shelf that lay just below

493
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:22,129
the surface of the water.

494
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:28,080
The rock came all the way into the shore and
you had to walk across it for a metre or two

495
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,210
before you could step down into the basin
of clear green water.

496
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,269
All the beaches on Rottnest were beautiful,
but this was the most inviting.

497
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:46,379
It seemed to Becky the perfect place to wash
away the memory of yesterday.

498
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:52,499
She walked across the rock shelf to the deeper
water of The Basin and dived in.

499
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:58,769
There was nothing like the feeling of salt
water on your skin and in your hair.

500
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:03,059
It made you feel clean and new.

501
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,479
Surrounded by the sparkling water she could
let go of the uneasy feeling she'd had since

502
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,550
her dream the night before.

503
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:18,230
The girls spent a few lazy hours at The Basin,
talking and swimming and lying on the beach

504
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:23,519
in the hot sun watching other people come
and go.

505
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,599
Then they slowly rode back to the cottage
to have lunch and change for tennis.

506
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:35,330
At the tennis courts, Natalie and Amber couldn't
wait to tell Dominic and Richard about their

507
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,570
ride to West End.

508
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,830
'You'll never guess what happened to us yesterday,'
started Amber.

509
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:50,139
The boys listened to the story, then Richard
turned to Becky, who hadn't said much.

510
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:55,249
'And you stayed there the whole time with
the body?' he asked.

511
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,379
'Yes,' said Becky.

512
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:01,330
'I mean, it wasn't long really.'

513
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,270
She spoke lightly, but the uneasy feeling
was rising inside her again.

514
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,779
Richard looked closely at her and smiled.

515
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:13,739
He threw her a tennis ball.

516
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:16,749
'Come on, you can be my partner,' he said.

517
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:19,799
'Amber and Natalie can be partners.

518
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,799
And Dom...'

519
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,799
He turned to his friend.

520
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,719
'You can collect the balls.'

521
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,719
'Hey!'

522
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,269
objected Dominic.

523
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:28,899
Everyone laughed.

524
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:32,720
And as they played, there was more laughter.

525
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,000
The boys were funny and confident.

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,240
They ran around the court doing crazy things.

527
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,389
Everyone changed partners several times until
they all sat down, sweaty and tired, in the

528
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:49,419
shade of a large fig tree at the side of the
court.

529
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,450
They all drank from their water bottles.

530
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,940
'Hey,' said Amber, turning to the boys.

531
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,940
'Why don't you guys come over to our cottage
for dinner tonight?

532
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,230
We'll cook.'

533
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,730
Becky and Natalie looked at each other in
horror.

534
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,139
What was she saying now?

535
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:12,210
Was she really inviting Richard and Dominic
to dinner?

536
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,139
Was this the same girl who only last night
had let the rice boil dry?

537
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:20,000
What was she thinking?

538
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,399
None of them could cook a proper meal.

539
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,970
Not a proper meal.

540
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,509
Not for guests.

541
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:30,799
Dominic looked at Richard who nodded his head.

542
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,289
'Yeah, we'll come,' he said.

543
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:36,289
'Thanks.'

544
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,220
Becky and Natalie smiled weakly at them.

545
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,779
'No, we can't roast anything,' said Becky
to Natalie.

546
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,350
'It's too hot.

547
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,859
The whole cottage would feel like an oven
by the time the meal was ready.'

548
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:58,249
The two girls were sitting at their little
kitchen table trying to think of ideas for

549
00:33:58,249 --> 00:33:59,249
dinner.

550
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:02,279
Amber was still in the shower.

551
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:06,309
'Chicken and vegetables with rice?' asked
Natalie.

552
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,489
Becky shook her head.

553
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:10,399
'It's a bit plain.

554
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,060
We need something more exciting.

555
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
Hey!

556
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,179
What about that pasta thing your mum makes?

557
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,300
That always looks good.'

558
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,630
'Yes,' said Natalie.

559
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,630
'Yes.

560
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,340
That wouldn't be too difficult at all.

561
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,220
Good idea.'

562
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,040
She went over to the cupboards under the sink
and opened them.

563
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,300
'There's a big pot for the pasta.

564
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,770
And we should be able to make the sauce in
this.'

565
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,360
She took out a large pan.

566
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
'Excellent!'

567
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,550
'Do you think you know how to make the sauce?'
asked Becky.

568
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,320
'I think so.

569
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,090
I've helped Mum make it a few times.'

570
00:34:54,090 --> 00:35:00,880
'So,' Becky continued, 'we can have pasta
and we can make a salad and we can get some

571
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,750
nice bread from the bakery and a cake for
afterwards, for dessert.'

572
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,650
'Excellent,' said Natalie again.

573
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,230
'Let's make a list.'

574
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:18,600
She found a piece of paper and a pen, sat
down at the table again and tried to remember

575
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,180
the ingredients for the pasta sauce.

576
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,780
Finally, she thought that she had written
them all down.

577
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,980
Then, with Becky's help, she added the salad
ingredients to the list.

578
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,290
Then underneath that, she wrote PASTA and
BREAD.

579
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:41,180
'Don't forget the cake for dessert,' reminded
Becky.

580
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,080
'Ooh, yes,' said Natalie.

581
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,710
And she wrote that down too.

582
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,860
Amber came in from the little bathroom off
the back verandah.

583
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,350
She looked at the ingredients on the list.

584
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,410
'See, I told you it would be easy,' she said.

585
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,020
'We haven't cooked it yet,' said Natalie.

586
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,550
The girls rode to the shops.

587
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:13,560
Amber went, into the bakery while the others
went next door into the General Store.

588
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,670
Natalie tore the list in two and gave one
half to Becky.

589
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,580
'I'll get the sauce ingredients,' she said.

590
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,690
'You get the stuff for the salad.'

591
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,930
'Okay,' said Becky.

592
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,410
She took a basket and went over to the fruit
and vegetables.

593
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,110
She began choosing things.

594
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:41,330
She had just picked up a tomato when suddenly
she heard part of a conversation behind her.

595
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,870
'It's definitely murder,' said a woman's voice.

596
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,370
'I spoke to Tom a few hours ago.'

597
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,960
'What did he say?' said another woman.

598
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,540
'The man was strangled.

599
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,200
He was probably dead before he hit the rocks...'

600
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,820
The women moved away.

601
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,930
Becky looked at the tomato in her hand.

602
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:11,750
It was split on one side and pale red juice
dripped down.

603
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,400
She was right.

604
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,310
The man on the rocks had been strangled.

605
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,690
She put the tomato back.

606
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,350
She had an uneasy, sick feeling in her stomach.

607
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:30,710
She filled her basket and went to find Natalie.

608
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:36,130
With a lot of careful planning and laughter
and remembering to keep Amber away from the

609
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,880
stove, dinner with the boys went well.

610
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,921
The girls had prepared the salad and the sauce
earlier in the evening, so all they had to

611
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:48,310
do when the boys arrived was cook the pasta.

612
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:54,850
Some of it stuck together and was a bit hard
but the girls hid those pieces on their own

613
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:58,590
plates and gave the best to the boys.

614
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,000
It was a great success.

615
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,070
Becky had told Amber and Natalie about what
she had heard in the General Store and, when

616
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,760
they first arrived, Amber told the boys.

617
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,520
But after that nobody mentioned the body on
the rocks and Becky was able to forget all

618
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,840
about it.

619
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:25,690
But later that night, she again had a strange
dream.

620
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,860
She was riding a bike along a sandy road.

621
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,990
Heavy drops of rain began to fall.

622
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,610
Drip, drop, drip.

623
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,630
They hit her in the face and ran down her
arms.

624
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,720
She looked down.

625
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,160
The rain was blood.

626
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,200
Blood dripped down her arms and legs.

627
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
She was covered in blood.

628
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,020
She threw down her bike and was standing at
the top of a cliff.

629
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,360
Down below her was the sea and the dead man
on the rocks.

630
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:06,070
Then the distance between them closed and
his body rushed up towards her.

631
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:09,070
His strangled neck was broken.

632
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,960
She looked at his face.

633
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,390
It was Richard.

634
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,140
CHAPTER SIX
West End again

635
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:29,040
Becky woke the next morning feeling tired
and haunted by her dreams.

636
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,020
She lay in bed and looked out at the water
of the bay.

637
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,410
This was supposed to be a free and easy island
holiday with her friends.

638
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,560
But how could it be?

639
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,690
With a horror film playing in her, head every
night?

640
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,360
She realized the only way to stop feeling
haunted was to stop pretending that she hadn't

641
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,000
come face-to-face with a dead man.

642
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,730
She dressed quickly and crept out of the cottage.

643
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:05,130
By the time she got back Natalie and Amber
were awake and having breakfast on the front

644
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,130
verandah.

645
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,130
'Hello.

646
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,320
Where have you been?' asked Amber.

647
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,770
'I just went to buy a newspaper,' said Becky.

648
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,770
'A newspaper?'

649
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,770
repeated Natalie.

650
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,940
'What about our holiday rule?

651
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,720
No television, no mobiles, no newspapers.

652
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Remember?'

653
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,030
'I remember,' said Becky.

654
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:33,690
'But when we made that rule I didn't know
we were going to find a dead man.'

655
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,070
She sat down and opened the newspaper.

656
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:42,330
'I just wondered if there was anything in
the paper about it, that's all.'

657
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,600
'I'd rather forget about it,' said Amber.

658
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,650
'Here it is,' said Becky.

659
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,480
'On page three.

660
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,320
"Murder on Rottnest".'

661
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,000
She read a few lines to herself and then began
to read aloud.

662
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,180
'The dead man was John Tavis Radcliff (51)
of Balcatta.

663
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,000
He had recently been released from prison.'

664
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,460
Becky looked up at the other two, then continued.

665
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,450
'Police are investigating Radcliff's prison
connections to try to find a motive for the

666
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,160
killing.

667
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,690
Radcliff was strangled at West End on Rottnest
Island on Saturday night.

668
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,730
His body was discovered by three teenage girls
the following morning.'

669
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,050
'That's us!' said Amber.

670
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,390
Becky continued reading.

671
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,250
'At present the police can see no connection
between Radcliff and Rottnest Island.

672
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:47,010
It is believed the killer followed him there
and that there is no threat to any other persons

673
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,470
on the island.'

674
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,630
Becky stopped reading and closed the paper.

675
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,470
'John Radcliff,' she said.

676
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,060
'Recently released from prison,' said Natalie.

677
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:05,700
'Yeah, he was probably some criminal who got
exactly what he deserved,' said Amber.

678
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,680
'Probably,' said Natalie.

679
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
Amber stood up.

680
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
'Yuck!

681
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,840
I don't want to think about it.

682
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,410
Come on, let's go swimming.'

683
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,920
'Let's go over to Salmon Bay,' said Natalie.

684
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,700
'There'll be no one there and we didn't get
a chance to see it the other day.'

685
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,080
'Okay,' said Amber.

686
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,220
'Bec?'

687
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,990
Becky had opened the newspaper again and wasn't
listening.

688
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,990
'Becky?'

689
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,990
'Huh?'

690
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:38,100
'Shall we go for a swim at Salmon Bay?'

691
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,310
Becky looked up.

692
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,780
'Oh, yes.

693
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,260
Yes, okay.

694
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,470
If you want.'

695
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:51,140
But by the time they got to Salmon Bay, Becky
had decided to leave the others there and

696
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,750
continue riding to West End.

697
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,750
'Why?'

698
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,750
asked Natalie.

699
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:01,210
'I never want to go there again,' added Amber.

700
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,830
Becky told them about her dreams.

701
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:07,660
'I feel a bit haunted, by him.

702
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:15,410
Maybe if I go to West End again and he's not
there I can release him, let him go, or he

703
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,630
can let me go or something...'

704
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,830
'Do you want us to come with you?' asked Natalie.

705
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,040
'But -' began Amber.

706
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,910
Becky interrupted, smiling.

707
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,140
'It's okay.

708
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,600
You two stay here.

709
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,320
I'll be all right.

710
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,720
I'll see you in about an hour.'

711
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:40,020
Some other riders passed by and Becky set
off confidently behind them.

712
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:46,470
However, the other riders soon turned off
onto a smaller road leading to another beach

713
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,850
and Becky was on her own.

714
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,080
She started to feel a bit frightened.

715
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,840
Then she got angry.

716
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,980
She had never felt frightened on Rottnest
before, ever.

717
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,530
It was always a safe place to be.

718
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:07,130
A safe place to ride your bike or go to the
shops by yourself when you were little; a

719
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:12,490
safe place to walk to the beach alone or with
your friends when you were a bit older.

720
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:18,550
It made you feel strong and independent, not
weak and frightened.

721
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,520
Becky didn't like it.

722
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,040
She rode on, determined to face the rocks
alone.

723
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,480
Then as she came over the last hill and saw
the end of the road, she burst out laughing.

724
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:39,570
A bus was parked and there were about twenty
people wandering around looking at the view.

725
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,500
She could see the bright yellow shirt of the
voluntary guide.

726
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,180
It must be a tour.

727
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,180
She rode down the hill and jumped off her
bike.

728
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,200
She went to the edge.

729
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,400
She could only see part of the rock shelf.

730
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,540
She couldn't see the place where the man had
lain.

731
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,410
'Okay, everyone,' said a voice suddenly behind
her.

732
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,410
It was the guide.

733
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,160
'It's time to get back on the bus.

734
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,830
Next stop - the lighthouse.'

735
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,040
Two minutes later Becky was alone again.

736
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,460
She decided to go a little way down so that
she could see the rock shelf better.

737
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,770
She wanted to imagine the dead man lying there
and then throw the picture in her mind into

738
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,950
the sea to wash it away, to get rid of it.

739
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,890
Carefully she climbed down.

740
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,930
When she could see the rock shelf properly,
she stopped and sat down.

741
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,660
It wasn't comfortable but she wouldn't be
there for long.

742
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,650
She looked down.

743
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,950
It wasn't hard to imagine the dead man.

744
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,540
The picture was still fresh in her brain.

745
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:58,360
She kept it there for a moment and then said
aloud, 'Mr Radcliff, I'm sorry about the way

746
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:06,660
that you died, but I want you out of my dreams
NOW,' and then she imagined throwing the picture

747
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,830
into the sea below.

748
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:15,140
In her mind, the water washed over it and
it was gone.

749
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,270
She stood up and turned to go.

750
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,190
She looked up.

751
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,410
There was someone there.

752
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,900
A man, she thought, in a red and white cap.

753
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,250
She couldn't see his face properly - the sun
was behind him.

754
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,950
He seemed to be watching her.

755
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,330
Becky tried to shake off the thought.

756
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,800
Of course, he's watching me.

757
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,020
He's wondering who the crazy person is down
on the rocks and if I'm going to fall to my

758
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,150
death.

759
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,550
She looked up again.

760
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,300
The man was very still.

761
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,680
He watched her.

762
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,910
Becky began to feel really frightened.

763
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,080
What could she do?

764
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,850
She couldn't stay down on the rocks.

765
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,530
She had to go back up to the top.

766
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,090
Her mind worked fast as she began to climb.

767
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,810
She looked for a path up the rocks that would
take her away from the man.

768
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,580
She glanced up.

769
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,000
He was still there, watching.

770
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,830
As soon as she reached the top, she would
grab her bike and get away from there.

771
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,650
Her heart beat fast in her chest.

772
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,530
She was nearly there.

773
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:32,130
She took two more steps on the rocks and then
she was on the flat sandy ground at the top.

774
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:37,190
She ran to her bike and grabbed it, then quickly
looked behind her.

775
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,370
Then she looked to the other side.

776
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:44,670
She looked all around, her heart knocking
in her chest.

777
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,720
The man had gone.

778
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,360
Becky decided not to tell Natalie and Amber
about the man in the cap.

779
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,590
She didn't want to spoil their holiday and
anyway, she told herself, she was probably

780
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,090
just imagining things.

781
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,300
The man was probably just an innocent visitor
having a look at the view.

782
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,030
But when the girls were back at the settlement
waiting in the line at the bakery to get some

783
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,420
lunch, Becky looked out of the window and
saw a bike leaning against a wall with a red

784
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,590
and white cap hanging from it.

785
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,540
Her heart beat fast again as she looked at
the faces around her.

786
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:32,180
There were about thirty people in the bakery
and dozens more outside.

787
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,760
The bike could belong to any one of them.

788
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,220
She began to feel more haunted than ever.

789
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,780
'Hey, there are Richard and Dominic!'

790
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,850
Amber called out suddenly.

791
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:46,930
The girls paid for their food.

792
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,850
'Come on!'

793
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,500
Amber grabbed Natalie and Becky and dragged
them out of the shop.

794
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,980
'Hurry up, or they'll be gone.'

795
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,850
And when Becky looked back, the bike with
the red and white cap on it was no longer

796
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:03,850
there.

797
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:10,050
The girls ate lunch with the boys at one of
the wooden tables outside and then they all

798
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,450
decided to ride over to The Basin for a swim.

799
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,520
'You're a bit quiet,' said Richard.

800
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,770
He had followed Becky out of the water and
sat down next to her on the sand.

801
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,760
The others were still swimming.

802
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,960
'Oh, don't mind me,' said Becky.

803
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,620
'It's nothing.'

804
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,200
She looked at him.

805
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,150
'It's just...'

806
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,090
'What?' asked Richard.

807
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,240
Becky looked down and laughed.

808
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,300
'No.

809
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,260
You'll think I'm stupid.'

810
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,240
'No, I won't,' said Richard gently.

811
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,710
'What is it?'

812
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:55,460
And suddenly Becky found herself telling him
all about her dreams and the man she thought

813
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,660
had been watching her, at West End.

814
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,960
'I couldn't see his face.

815
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:07,110
He had a cap on and the sun was behind him,
but I'm sure he was watching me.'

816
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,520
She looked at Richard.

817
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,060
'I told you it was crazy.'

818
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,690
He smiled at her.

819
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,430
'No, it's not.'

820
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,580
He looked at the water.

821
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,030
'I've never seen a dead body.'

822
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,150
'No,' said Becky.

823
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,980
'I hadn't either until...'

824
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,550
'I think I'd dream about it too.'

825
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,150
Richard paused.

826
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,130
'But try not to worry about the man you saw
today.

827
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,830
I think he was just a man, don't you?

828
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,350
Nothing to do with it.'

829
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,840
He looked at her.

830
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:49,800
'And if I'm in any more of your dreams, be
sure to let me know.'

831
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,100
Becky laughed.

832
00:50:51,100 --> 00:51:00,550
And that night she slept as peacefully as
a baby.

833
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,980
CHAPTER SEVEN
To the lighthouse

834
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:09,400
'Hey, Bec, have you still got that list of
tours that the woman gave you on the ferry?'

835
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,800
asked Natalie.

836
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,300
'I don't know,' answered Becky.

837
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,610
'It's probably still in the pocket of my skirt.

838
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,440
Why do you want it?'

839
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,790
Natalie went inside to find Becky's skirt.

840
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,310
'Dominic said that you can go to the top of
the lighthouse,' she called.

841
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,310
'I thought it might be fun.'

842
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:33,650
'The lighthouse near Pinky Beach?' asked Amber.

843
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,000
Natalie returned with the yellow pamphlet.

844
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,020
'No, the one in the middle of the island - on
Wadjemup Hill.'

845
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,590
She looked at the list.

846
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,990
'Yes, here it is,' she said, reading.

847
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:54,151
'It was opened for tours eighteen months ago
- the first time in a hundred and nine years.

848
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:56,730
They take you there on a bus.

849
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,710
You can get tickets from the Tourist Information
building.'

850
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:02,980
She looked at the others.

851
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,260
They didn't look very excited,

852
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,280
'It would be a great view from the top,' she
said.

853
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,340
'Come on.'

854
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,840
Amber and Becky looked at each other.

855
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,810
'Okay,' they agreed.

856
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:22,270
It was a good view from the top of the lighthouse.

857
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:25,430
You could see the whole island.

858
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:29,640
And the tour turned out to be quite interesting.

859
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:37,790
The lighthouse they climbed was in fact a
'new' one, having been built in 1896.

860
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:44,820
All that remained of the original one, built
in 1849, was a small stone building next to

861
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,950
the lighthouse.

862
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,590
Inside this building there was information
about the history of the lighthouse - the

863
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:57,940
plans of the original tower, details about
the height of the tower and the size and strength

864
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:04,810
of the lamp and, over on one wall, photographs
of some of the lighthouse keepers and underneath

865
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:13,470
them a full list of all the lighthouse keepers,
starting with the first in 1851 up until the

866
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,740
last in 1990.

867
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:19,000
Becky glanced down the list.

868
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,600
Suddenly one of the names jumped out at her
- Leslie Tavis Newman.

869
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,650
'Tavis'.

870
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,920
Wasn't that the middle name of the dead man?

871
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,650
Becky tried to remember.

872
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:38,090
Yes - John Tavis Radcliff.

873
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,420
That was it!

874
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,530
Tavis.

875
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:45,490
It was an unusual name.

876
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:53,290
Most people's middle name was like their first
- John, Peter, Andrew, Mary, Susan.

877
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:57,060
Becky's own middle name was Jane.

878
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,970
But Tavis was different.

879
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,590
It sounded like a family name - a surname.

880
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,410
Perhaps it was the surname of a woman who
had married into the family and didn't want

881
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,160
to lose her maiden name.

882
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,080
Becky's aunt did that.

883
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:20,220
When she married Becky's uncle, she took his
surname, but when she had children, she gave

884
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,250
them her maiden name as their middle name.

885
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:29,230
'Are you coming?' said the guide suddenly
at her shoulder.

886
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,570
Becky jumped and turned.

887
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,250
She hadn't realized the others had left the
building.

888
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,630
She turned back and pointed at the list on
the wall.

889
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,740
'This lighthouse keeper, Leslie Tavis Newman.

890
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,869
Do you know anything about him?'

891
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:50,660
The elderly guide looked surprised.

892
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,210
'Yes, I do,' he said.

893
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,180
'A bit of a sad story, that one.'

894
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,280
'Why?'

895
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,490
asked Becky.

896
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,600
'Well...'

897
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,920
The guide paused.

898
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,480
'He was the keeper here during the early 1960s.

899
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:16,280
But a sixteen-year-old girl was killed on
the island and Newman was accused of her murder.

900
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,000
A nasty business.

901
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,240
There was no solid proof and it never went
to court, but it was an enormous scandal.

902
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,420
It was in the newspapers for weeks.

903
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:38,329
And in 1962 - whether because he was guilty
or because of the scandal, we'll never know

904
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:41,670
- Newman committed suicide.'

905
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,670
'What?

906
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,050
Here at the lighthouse?'

907
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,590
said Becky.

908
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:54,380
'No,' said the guide, leading the way out
of the building, 'not here.'

909
00:55:54,380 --> 00:56:00,760
Then he added, raising his voice so the others
waiting outside could hear, 'Although there

910
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,380
have been several deaths at the lighthouse.'

911
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,630
He turned to speak to everyone.

912
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:18,390
'As some of you may know, from 1838 to 1931
Rottnest Island was used as an aboriginal

913
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:19,820
prison.

914
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:27,040
Aboriginal people who had committed crimes
were sent here to be "civilized".

915
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,740
In fact, the white settlers wanted to get
them out of the way.

916
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,440
It was hard to escape from an island.

917
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:44,660
It is believed that during these years about
three thousand seven hundred men and boys

918
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,680
were kept here.

919
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:55,470
The oldest buildings on the island, including
the lighthouse, were built by aboriginal prisoners.

920
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:02,170
Unfortunately, during the building of the
lighthouse three prisoners died.

921
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:10,370
Two fell from the tower itself and a third
man was beaten to death by the white prison

922
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,890
guards.'

923
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:18,670
Becky looked up at the beautiful white stone
tower, its outline sharp against the bright

924
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:21,310
blue of the sky.

925
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:29,220
'The word Wadjemup,' continued the guide,
'is the local aboriginal word for Rottnest.

926
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:36,430
It simply means, "place across the water".'

927
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:41,930
Going back to the settlement in the bus, Becky
looked out of the window.

928
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:46,200
She had always thought of Rottnest as a sunny,
happy place.

929
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,870
She'd thought it had always been a holiday
island.

930
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,360
She'd never heard about its history before.

931
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:59,530
This lovely, sunny holiday place had a dark
past.

932
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:07,720
And that dark past reached forward to 1962
- to a dead girl and the lighthouse keeper's

933
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,060
suicide.

934
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:15,230
And suddenly the question became clear - the
question that had been forming in her mind

935
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:20,470
since the moment she saw the name Tavis on
that list.

936
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:25,810
Could the body on the rocks be connected to
something that happened in 1962?

937
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:33,370
But surely, it was just a coincidence that
both men had the same middle name.

938
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:40,140
Perhaps, if she questioned people, she'd find
dozens with the middle name Tavis.

939
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,240
Yes, it must be a coincidence.

940
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:50,430
And, anyway, even if the two men were from
the same family or something, it didn't mean

941
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:55,540
that Radcliff's death was connected to Newman's
suicide.

942
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:01,380
But by the time, the bus arrived back at the
settlement Becky knew that she had to find

943
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,590
out more about Leslie Tavis Newman.

944
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,780
But how?

945
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:13,250
She got out of the bus and stood with Natalie
and Amber in the shade of a big fig tree.

946
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:17,050
'I told you it would be a good tour,' said
Natalie.

947
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,430
'It was all right,' said Amber.

948
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,490
'It was good exercise walking up all those
steps.'

949
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:28,400
'It was excellent!' said Becky, suddenly full
of energy.

950
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,080
'It wasn't that good,' said Amber.

951
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,380
But Becky just smiled.

952
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:47,540
She had suddenly remembered who might be able
to tell her more about 1962.

953
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:52,880
CHAPTER EIGTH
1962

954
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,460
Becky opened the back gate of the cottage
and looked out.

955
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:02,080
'Finally, they're home,' she said to herself.

956
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,550
She left the gate open and walked across the
road.

957
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:11,190
Three of the women from the cottage opposite
sat on their verandah playing some kind of

958
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,410
board game.

959
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:17,810
As Becky got closer, she could see that it
was Scrabble.

960
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,040
'Hello,' she called.

961
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,580
The women waved.

962
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,170
'Are you any good at Scrabble?'

963
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,300
said one of them.

964
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,470
'I'm losing here.'

965
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:28,470
Becky laughed.

966
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,460
'Actually, do you mind if I come in?

967
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,920
I wanted to ask you something.'

968
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,050
'Of course not, love,' replied the woman.

969
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,280
'Come in, come in.

970
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,810
Grab a chair.'

971
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,510
Becky got a chair and brought it to the table.

972
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:51,130
'I'm Shirl,' said the woman, 'and this is
Ruth, and Sally.'

973
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,120
The other women smiled at Becky.

974
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,390
She sat down.

975
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,410
'I'm Becky,' she said.

976
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:05,230
'I'm sorry to interrupt your game but I wanted
to know something and I thought you might

977
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,860
be able to help.'

978
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,600
The women all looked at her and waited.

979
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,340
'Um...'

980
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,060
Suddenly she didn't know where to start.

981
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,060
'Um...

982
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:26,280
I went on a tour of Wadjemup lighthouse today
and the guide told me a story about one of

983
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,160
the lighthouse keepers, Leslie Newman.

984
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:35,580
He was accused of killing a girl about forty-five
years ago.'

985
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,100
She turned to Shirl.

986
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:44,170
'And I remember you said the other day that
you all used to come here when you were children.

987
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:49,940
And I wondered, well, if you remember anything
about it.'

988
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,170
Shirl sat back in her seat.

989
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:56,250
'Leslie Newman,' she breathed.

990
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:00,260
'It's a long time since I've heard that name.'

991
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,920
'So you do remember?' asked Becky.

992
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,150
'Oh, yes,' replied Shirl.

993
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,990
'You couldn't forget.

994
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,990
It was in all the newspapers.

995
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,460
Quite a scandal.

996
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,640
I must have been about fourteen years old.'

997
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,780
'Yes, I was about ten, I think,' added Sally.

998
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,220
'I was seven,' said Ruth.

999
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:32,800
'My mother wouldn't let me go anywhere alone
for weeks after that girl was killed,' said

1000
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Shirl.

1001
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,630
'What happened?' asked Becky.

1002
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,230
'Oh, well, who knows?' said Shirl.

1003
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:46,600
'The girl - ooh, what was her name?

1004
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Bessie?

1005
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Libby?'

1006
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,440
'Lizzie,' said Sally.

1007
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,500
'Lizzie Keegan,' added Ruth.

1008
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,050
'Lizzie Keegan, that was it,' said Shirl.

1009
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,840
'She was only sixteen.

1010
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,370
She was found strangled out at West End.'

1011
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,080
'West End?'

1012
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,200
repeated Becky.

1013
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,610
'Ooh, like that man the other day,' said Sally.

1014
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,410
'Did you hear about that?'

1015
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,240
Becky nodded.

1016
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,869
'But Lizzie Keegan wasn't a criminal,' said
Shirl.

1017
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:22,840
'No,' said Ruth.

1018
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:28,050
'Anyway,' continued Shirl, 'it was a big shock
for everyone.

1019
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:35,450
Rottnest seems quiet and peaceful these days,
so imagine what it was like in I960.'

1020
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,220
'1961,' said Ruth.

1021
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,990
'Yes,' said Shirl.

1022
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:45,680
'There were no settlements at Geordie and
Longreach - no coffee shops, no regular bus

1023
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,900
service around the island.

1024
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:53,450
The bakery was just a small place - six people
inside and it was full.'

1025
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:59,770
'Only the original cottages built in the 1920s
and 30s were here,' said Sally.

1026
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:05,260
'And it wasn't difficult to rent a cottage
any time you wanted to.

1027
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:10,359
The same families met on the island year after
year for their holidays.'

1028
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:13,600
'And some of the best families too,' added
Shirl.

1029
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:21,210
'The Parkers, the Scanlons, the Angwins, the
Timperleys - remember?'

1030
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:23,250
she said to Ruth and Sally.

1031
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,200
They nodded.

1032
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:31,120
Then she said to Becky, 'Of course, they stayed
on their boats.'

1033
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,940
The name Timperley was familiar to Becky.

1034
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,400
There was a Timperley Park near her old school.

1035
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,800
And she thought the Timperleys owned a newspaper.

1036
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,369
But she hadn't heard of the other families.

1037
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:53,359
'So, it was a big shock?' said Becky, trying
to get the women back on the subject of Lizzie

1038
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,359
Keegan.

1039
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:57,030
'Oh, yes,' said Shirl.

1040
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,550
'And do you remember why Leslie Newman was
suspected?'

1041
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:07,859
'Oh, he was seen with the girl just before
she died,' answered Sally.

1042
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:10,109
'Where?' asked Becky.

1043
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:12,300
'Oh, I can't remember, love.'

1044
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,520
'I mean, did lots of people see him or -'

1045
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,750
'One of the Scanlon boys, I think,' said Ruth
slowly.

1046
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:27,130
'Yes, one of the Scanlon boys said they saw
Newman with Lizzie.'

1047
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:33,760
'Of course, he said over and over again that
he didn't do it,' said Shirl.

1048
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,710
'Do you think he did?' asked Becky.

1049
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:40,450
'I think he did,' said Ruth.

1050
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:46,400
'I certainly thought so then,' said Shirl
'But then I was young.

1051
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,720
We all were.

1052
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,810
The papers certainly made him look guilty.

1053
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,810
Perhaps he was.

1054
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,400
Perhaps he wasn't.'

1055
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:01,550
'I suppose a man living alone in a lighthouse
is an obvious suspect,' said Becky.

1056
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,190
Shirl looked down at the table.

1057
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:05,570
'Oh, he wasn't alone, love.

1058
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:09,390
He had a wife and a young son.

1059
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,390
Heavens!

1060
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:14,123
What am I supposed to do with these?'

1061
01:06:14,123 --> 01:06:16,040
She showed Becky her Scrabble letters.

1062
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,330
'How can I make a word out of that?'

1063
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:31,340
Becky read the letters - N, N, P, Y, X, J,
H - and laughed.

1064
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:35,220
'I don't think I can help you.'

1065
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,270
She pushed her chair back and stood up.

1066
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:41,920
'Well, I'd better let you get back to your
game.

1067
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,150
Thanks for talking to me.'

1068
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:48,820
'Any time, love,' said Shirl 'Any time.

1069
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,890
We love a chat.'

1070
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:56,890
That evening Dominic and Richard invited the
girls to dinner.

1071
01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:02,540
'But we're not cooking,' said Dominic over
the wall between their two cottages.

1072
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:06,080
'We'll take you for a pizza.'

1073
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,650
There was a pizza restaurant in the old hotel
at the end of their row of cottages.

1074
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:15,660
It was bright and noisy and the pizza was
good.

1075
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,119
They all ate too much.

1076
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:23,370
'Oh, my stomach,' said Dominic, as they left
the restaurant.

1077
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,750
'I'm going to explode.'

1078
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:31,020
'Not near me you're not,' said Amber, running
ahead and laughing.

1079
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:36,680
'Hey, let's go for a walk along the jetty,'
said Natalie.

1080
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:44,060
'Okay,' said Dominic and he and Natalie ran
to catch up with Amber.

1081
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,440
Richard and Becky walked slowly behind.

1082
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,380
It was a still night.

1083
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,800
The moon shone on the dark water.

1084
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:57,230
'Did you have any bad dreams last night?'
asked Richard.

1085
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:00,300
Becky shook her head and smiled.

1086
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,330
'No.'

1087
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:06,700
'But I did find out something strange today,'
she added.

1088
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:12,841
'We went for a tour of the lighthouse and
on the wall was a list of names of the lighthouse

1089
01:08:12,841 --> 01:08:13,841
keepers.

1090
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:22,309
And there was one from 1960 to 1962 called
Leslie Tavis Newman.'

1091
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:24,079
'1960?' said Richard.

1092
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,679
'Did they still have lighthouse keepers then?

1093
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,259
Wasn't it run by a machine or something?'

1094
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:31,599
'No,' said Becky.

1095
01:08:31,599 --> 01:08:35,719
'I read that there was a keeper there until
1990.'

1096
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:36,719
'Oh.'

1097
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:42,239
'Anyway, that's not the point,' continued
Becky.

1098
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:51,349
'The point is that Leslie Tavis Newman had
the same middle name as the dead man we found,

1099
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:52,880
John Tavis Radcliff.

1100
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,829
Have you ever heard that name before - Tavis?'

1101
01:08:56,829 --> 01:09:00,009
'No,' said Richard.

1102
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:05,020
'It's certainly unusual, but Becky interrupted.

1103
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:12,890
'So I thought I'd find out more about him
- Leslie Newman, I mean.

1104
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:14,999
And guess what?'

1105
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:17,100
'What, Miss Detective?'

1106
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,210
asked Richard, smiling.

1107
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:25,029
Becky told him all about Lizzie Keegan and
Newman's suicide and the other things that

1108
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:26,789
the women had told her.

1109
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:34,650
'I mean,' she finished, 'don't you think it's
a strange coincidence that these men have

1110
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:40,659
the same middle name and that Radcliff was
killed in the same place as the girl?'

1111
01:09:40,659 --> 01:09:45,049
'Well... maybe,' said Richard, 'but -'

1112
01:09:45,049 --> 01:09:47,739
Again, Becky cut him off.

1113
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:54,429
'Look, suppose John Tavis Radcliff was the
son of Leslie Tavis Newman.

1114
01:09:54,429 --> 01:09:59,389
The women said Newman had a young son.

1115
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:01,699
The newspaper said Radcliff was fifty-one.

1116
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:06,300
That would make him quite young in 1962.'

1117
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,389
'Yes,' said Richard.

1118
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:12,400
'But they don't have the same surname.'

1119
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,860
'I know, but perhaps Radcliff changed his
surname.'

1120
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,860
'Why?'

1121
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,090
'I don't know.

1122
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:26,460
But suppose the lighthouse keeper, Newman,
didn't kill the girl?

1123
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,699
And suppose that, somehow, Radcliff knew who
did?

1124
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:35,219
The real killer could still be alive.

1125
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:38,440
He would be old now but...'

1126
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,510
Richard stopped walking.

1127
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:48,800
'So, you think the real killer followed Radcliff
and killed him too?'

1128
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,679
Becky turned and walked the few steps back
to Richard.

1129
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:57,050
'Or he got someone to do it for him.'

1130
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,050
Richard laughed.

1131
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,760
'That's a lot of supposing, Becky.'

1132
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,070
'I know.

1133
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:05,019
But here's more.

1134
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:09,729
Suppose the killer is still on the island?

1135
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:14,979
Suppose it's the man with the cap, I saw at
West End?

1136
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:19,760
And suppose he followed me there?'

1137
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,880
'Becky!

1138
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,000
Richard!'

1139
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,929
called Natalie softly through the dark.

1140
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:27,010
'Come quick!'

1141
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:32,050
Dominic, Natalie and Amber were at the end
of the jetty.

1142
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,550
Becky and Richard ran to join them.

1143
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:40,710
'We think we saw a dugong or something,' said
Amber.

1144
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:41,949
'A dugong?'

1145
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:44,280
Becky looked over the edge into the water.

1146
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,280
'Where?'

1147
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,400
'Let's just wait and watch,' said Dominic.

1148
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:56,349
They all stood there in the quiet night, watching
the dark water.

1149
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:59,429
The sky was full of stars.

1150
01:11:59,429 --> 01:12:01,190
The air was warm.

1151
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:05,289
The water moved in gentle waves around them.

1152
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:08,210
'There!' said Richard softly.

1153
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:12,679
He moved close to Becky and pointed.

1154
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:19,119
Something moved just below the surface of
the water.

1155
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:21,110
Something big and dark.

1156
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:29,460
They only saw it for a moment but it looked
ancient - like a creature from long ago.

1157
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:41,889
It was just a shape, a shadow, and then it
was gone.

1158
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:44,080
CHAPTER NINE
Buried treasure

1159
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:53,329
A little later, returning to their cottages,
the girls invited the boys in for a coffee.

1160
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:58,190
They pulled extra chairs outside and sat on
the verandah.

1161
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:02,710
'Do you really think it was a dugong?'

1162
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,849
Natalie asked Dominic.

1163
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:07,639
'It could have just been a seal.'

1164
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:10,880
'It was too big,' said Amber.

1165
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,090
'I didn't think dugongs swam this far south,'
said Natalie.

1166
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:20,750
'Yeah, but I've never seen a seal around here
either,' said Dominic.

1167
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,690
'And it was big.'

1168
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:27,840
'It was like something from another time,'
said Becky.

1169
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:35,010
'Anyway,' said Amber, looking from Richard
to Becky and back again, 'what were you two

1170
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,070
talking about during your little walk together?'

1171
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,929
'Nothing,' answered Becky.

1172
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:41,790
'I was just...

1173
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:47,460
I was just telling him about our tour of the
lighthouse.'

1174
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,640
'Oh.'

1175
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,179
Amber looked disappointed.

1176
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:57,329
'Actually, that's reminded me of something,'
said Richard.

1177
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:58,639
He laughed.

1178
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:02,050
'I haven't thought about it for years.'

1179
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:04,219
'What?' asked Dominic.

1180
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:11,590
'Well, when I was little I used to come to
Rottnest a lot with my family.

1181
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:16,059
And my brother and I used to play up near
the lighthouse.

1182
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:20,619
Not Wadjemup - the other one near Pinky Beach.

1183
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:23,559
We used to pretend to be pirates.

1184
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:29,840
We built ships in the sand hills and made
a really bad pirate flag.'

1185
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,060
The girls laughed.

1186
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:36,150
'Did you bury some treasure?' asked Becky.

1187
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:39,789
'Oh, yeah, lots,' grinned Richard.

1188
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:42,679
'Mum gave us a biscuit tin.

1189
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:45,389
That was our treasure chest.'

1190
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:49,070
Richard sat forward, his elbows resting on
his knees.

1191
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:54,070
'In fact, it's probably still buried there.'

1192
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:57,289
'Really?' said Amber.

1193
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:00,690
'Well, I can't remember bringing it home.

1194
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,960
I can't remember what happened to it.

1195
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,119
You know what it's like when you're little.

1196
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:12,110
One minute the best game in the world is being
a pirate and the next it's something else.

1197
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:17,479
As far as I know the tin's still buried up
there near the lighthouse.'

1198
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:21,610
'Yeah, but it wouldn't be, would it?' said
Dominic.

1199
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:24,349
'Someone would have found it by now.'

1200
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:26,570
'Probably,' agreed Richard.

1201
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,530
'Imagine that,' said Dominic.

1202
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:35,690
'You're seven or eight years old and you're
playing and digging a hole and suddenly you

1203
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:38,230
find a box full of treasure.

1204
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,570
You'd be so excited.'

1205
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:46,849
'Yeah, it wouldn't still be there after all
these years,' said Richard.

1206
01:15:46,849 --> 01:15:54,380
But as the boys left to go back to their own
cottage, Richard pulled Becky aside and whispered,

1207
01:15:54,380 --> 01:16:01,920
'Listen, I know my old treasure chest is probably
gone by now, but do you want to go to the

1208
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,150
lighthouse with me tomorrow and have a look?'

1209
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:09,260
Becky nodded.

1210
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:13,260
The next morning they set off on their bikes.

1211
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:18,320
It was only a short ride to the other end
of Thomson Bay and then up the small hill

1212
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,329
where the lighthouse stood.

1213
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:25,909
Soon they were leaning their bikes against
the white tower and looking at the sand hills

1214
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:27,909
and the sparkling sea beyond.

1215
01:16:27,909 --> 01:16:31,880
'Where do we start?' asked Becky.

1216
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,190
They were surrounded by sand.

1217
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:38,579
The treasure chest could be anywhere.

1218
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:40,760
Richard grinned at her.

1219
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,099
'Um...'

1220
01:16:42,099 --> 01:16:45,829
The whole idea was starting to look crazy.

1221
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:51,230
'I'm sure we buried it over there somewhere.

1222
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:54,039
He walked a few steps away from Becky.

1223
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:58,710
'There used to be a rock sticking out of the
sand somewhere around here.

1224
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:02,949
We'd always bury it near that so we could
find it again.

1225
01:17:02,949 --> 01:17:08,090
I guess the sand has moved and covered the
rock now.'

1226
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,699
He looked back at Becky.

1227
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:16,269
She laughed, walked over to him and knelt
on the sand.

1228
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:17,409
'Well, come on.

1229
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:18,940
Let's have a look.'

1230
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:21,420
They began to dig.

1231
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,729
Twenty minutes later, they had found nothing.

1232
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,729
Becky sat back on the sand.

1233
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:31,409
'I can't dig anymore,' she laughed.

1234
01:17:31,409 --> 01:17:35,659
'Even if it is here we'll never find it.

1235
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:38,219
It's hopeless.'

1236
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:39,699
Richard sat down next to her.

1237
01:17:39,699 --> 01:17:43,380
They looked out at the water.

1238
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:49,179
Richard said, 'I've been thinking about all
that stuff you told me last night.'

1239
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:52,329
'So have I,' said Becky.

1240
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:56,720
'I suppose Radcliff's death could be connected
to this man Newman, but -'

1241
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,789
'I know, I know,' said Becky.

1242
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:03,110
'It's all coincidence and guessing.

1243
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,489
It's stupid.

1244
01:18:04,489 --> 01:18:05,820
I'm just guessing.'

1245
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:10,380
'It's not stupid,' said Richard gently.

1246
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,670
'You sat with a dead man for half an hour.

1247
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:16,940
You just want to know why he died.'

1248
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,679
He paused.

1249
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:23,030
'But maybe you should let the police deal
with it, eh?

1250
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,969
It's only making you upset.

1251
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:32,000
You,' he looked at her, 'should be enjoying
your holiday.'

1252
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,489
'I know, I know.'

1253
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:40,039
Becky threw out her arms and lay back on the
sand.

1254
01:18:40,039 --> 01:18:44,699
'Ow!' she said, pulling her left arm back
towards her.

1255
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:47,769
'What is it?' asked Richard.

1256
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,229
'Something sharp,' said Becky.

1257
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:52,080
'Under the sand.'

1258
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,670
Richard jumped up to have a look.

1259
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:57,159
'It's the rock!' he said.

1260
01:18:57,159 --> 01:19:04,070
They both began to dig again, pushing the
loose dry sand to one side.

1261
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:07,559
Suddenly Becky's fingers touched something
hard.

1262
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:10,449
'Here!' she said.

1263
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:18,960
Richard swept the sand away with his hand
and there it was - a rusty old biscuit tin.

1264
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,670
'This is it!' he said.

1265
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:29,280
'I can't believe it's still here,' breathed
Becky.

1266
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,969
Richard pulled the tin out.

1267
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:32,690
'Come on,' he said.

1268
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:34,949
'Let's have a look inside.'

1269
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:39,110
They went to sit on the sand in the shade
of the lighthouse.

1270
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:43,309
With a bit of effort Richard got the lid off.

1271
01:19:43,309 --> 01:19:51,360
'Oh, my old plane,' he said as soon as he
saw the things inside.

1272
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,229
He took a little toy plane out of the tin.

1273
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:58,040
'I used to love this.'

1274
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:04,699
He put it down on the sand and ran his fingers
through the other things in the tin.

1275
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:08,550
'Not much of a treasure, is it?' he laughed.

1276
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:15,070
There were broken gold and silver chains,
brightly coloured glass 'jewels', lots of

1277
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:20,750
brown one - and two-cent coins and some paper
money from a children's game.

1278
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:26,920
'What's this?' asked Becky, taking out a silver
medal.

1279
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,579
'Oh, that's Pete's,' said Richard.

1280
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:31,500
'My brother Peter's.

1281
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,099
He won it in a swimming race.'

1282
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:35,900
He took the medal from Becky.

1283
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,440
'He was so proud when he won that.

1284
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,510
I'll give it to him.'

1285
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,420
He put the medal back in the tin.

1286
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:49,040
'Oh,' he said, picking up a folded tissue.

1287
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,250
'I'd forgotten about this.

1288
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,959
This was our best treasure.

1289
01:20:55,959 --> 01:20:57,599
I found it.

1290
01:20:57,599 --> 01:21:01,229
I was sure it was real gold.'

1291
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:06,000
He unfolded the tissue and showed Becky what
was inside.

1292
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,330
'Actually, it doesn't look too bad,' he said.

1293
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:15,630
'I don't think it's expensive but it looks
like it is real gold.'

1294
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:21,449
'It's sweet,' said Becky, picking it up.

1295
01:21:21,449 --> 01:21:27,670
It was a thin gold chain necklace with a small
gold heart hanging from it.

1296
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:33,559
The shape of a flower was cut into the top
of one side of the heart and there was a very

1297
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:36,559
small green jewel at the flower's centre.

1298
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,400
'Here,' said Richard.

1299
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,250
'Try it on.'

1300
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:46,239
He took the chain and fastened it around her
neck.

1301
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,040
He turned her to face him.

1302
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,449
'It looks good on you,' he said.

1303
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,699
'Keep it.'

1304
01:21:53,699 --> 01:22:00,469
Becky looked down at the necklace and smiled.

1305
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:05,999
Later that afternoon, as Becky was walking
back from the shops, she saw Shirl sitting

1306
01:22:05,999 --> 01:22:11,130
on the front wall of the opposite cottage,
her towel over one shoulder.

1307
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,719
'Hi,' said Becky.

1308
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,709
'Hello, love,' said Shirl.

1309
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:17,199
'I'm just waiting for Ruth.

1310
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,789
We're going for a quick swim at The Basin.'

1311
01:22:19,789 --> 01:22:22,320
Ruth appeared at the door.

1312
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,329
'I'm coming.

1313
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:27,920
I'm coming,' she said smiling, as she ran
down the path.

1314
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:34,880
Then, as she got closer to them, the smile
suddenly dropped from her face.

1315
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,940
She stood still and stared at Becky.

1316
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,869
'What do you think you're doing?' she demanded.

1317
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:42,639
'Sorry?' said Becky.

1318
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,610
'I said, what do you think you're doing?

1319
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:51,019
You come here asking questions and then...

1320
01:22:51,019 --> 01:22:53,959
Where did you get that?'

1321
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:57,139
'What?' asked Becky.

1322
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,260
'That necklace.'

1323
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,749
Ruth was shouting now.

1324
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:04,309
'Where did you get it?'

1325
01:23:04,309 --> 01:23:06,530
Becky looked at Shirl.

1326
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:08,560
'Ruth?' said Shirl.

1327
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,080
'What are you talking about?'

1328
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,040
Ruth was pale and shaking.

1329
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,590
'You don't know,' she said.

1330
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:19,709
'You don't know.'

1331
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:24,059
Shirl took Ruth's arm and guided her up the
path.

1332
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:28,769
'Come back and sit on the verandah,' she said.

1333
01:23:28,769 --> 01:23:29,979
Becky followed them.

1334
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:36,170
Shirl sat Ruth down and went to get her a
glass of water.

1335
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,199
Ruth looked at Becky.

1336
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:40,050
She was calmer now.

1337
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,469
'I'm sorry,' she said.

1338
01:23:42,469 --> 01:23:43,469
'I'm sorry.

1339
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:44,469
I...'

1340
01:23:44,469 --> 01:23:48,739
Shirl returned with the water and gave it
to Ruth.

1341
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:52,150
'Now, what's all this about?'

1342
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,769
she asked, sitting down next to her.

1343
01:23:54,769 --> 01:23:58,619
'I'm sorry,' said Ruth again.

1344
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:00,159
'It's silly.

1345
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,159
I...'

1346
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,239
She took a drink of the water.

1347
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:05,619
She looked at the glass.

1348
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:09,760
'There's something you don't know,' she said.

1349
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,110
'I didn't see any reason to tell you before.

1350
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:17,360
It all happened such a long time ago.'

1351
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,920
She looked at Shirl.

1352
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:26,909
'You only know me by my married name, but
my maiden name was Ruth Keegan.

1353
01:24:26,909 --> 01:24:36,130
I'm Lizzie Keegan's younger sister.'

1354
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:38,389
CHAPTER TEN
A coincidence

1355
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:42,280
'Oh my God.'

1356
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:46,479
Shirl slowly sat back in her chair.

1357
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:51,229
'That poor girl was your sister?'

1358
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:53,090
Ruth looked at Becky.

1359
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:58,800
'That necklace,' she said, 'is just like one
Lizzie had.

1360
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,440
I remember it because I was with her when
she bought it.'

1361
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,820
She looked away.

1362
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,630
'She loved it.

1363
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:08,949
She never took it off.

1364
01:25:08,949 --> 01:25:13,929
But when they found her body, the necklace
wasn't there.

1365
01:25:13,929 --> 01:25:16,940
I remember my mother screaming about it.

1366
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,190
She went on and on.

1367
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:23,090
I remember thinking, It's just a necklace.

1368
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,749
What about Lizzie?'

1369
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:29,090
'I didn't come back to Rottnest for a long
time.

1370
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:31,190
I was frightened of remembering.

1371
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:40,550
But then I met all of you girls,' she looked
at Shirl, 'and that made it a good place again.

1372
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:44,530
When I did think of Lizzie here, I felt close
to her.

1373
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:49,030
All my last memories of her are here.'

1374
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:50,579
She turned to Becky.

1375
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:57,420
'Then the other day you came asking questions,
and now here you are wearing that necklace.

1376
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,909
I just got a fright, that's all.

1377
01:26:00,909 --> 01:26:04,050
For a moment, I thought it was Lizzie's.

1378
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,539
It was silly.

1379
01:26:05,539 --> 01:26:08,010
It's not an unusual necklace.

1380
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:10,929
There are probably thousands of them around.

1381
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:17,170
It was just seeing it again here, on Rottnest,
after all these years.'

1382
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:26,780
'Oh Ruth, I'm so sorry,' said Shirl, putting
her hand on Ruth's arm.

1383
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:30,019
Becky put her hand to her throat to cover
the necklace.

1384
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:33,719
'I had no idea,' she said.

1385
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:36,280
'I didn't mean to upset you.

1386
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,690
I had no idea.'

1387
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,099
'It's all right, dear.

1388
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:42,309
I know.

1389
01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:44,409
It was all a long time ago.'

1390
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:47,010
Ruth stood up.

1391
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,870
'Let's go for that swim now, Shirl.

1392
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,849
I think I need it.'

1393
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:59,590
Becky followed the two women down to the gate
and then watched as they walked arm in arm

1394
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,510
up the road.

1395
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:05,699
She put her hand again to the necklace at
her throat.

1396
01:27:05,699 --> 01:27:08,650
She couldn't believe this!

1397
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:14,659
She and her friends find a murdered man who
has the same unusual middle name as a man

1398
01:27:14,659 --> 01:27:20,420
who, in 1962, committed suicide because he
was accused of killing a girl.

1399
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:26,590
And now she discovers she has been talking
to the sister of that girl?

1400
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:31,329
And wearing a necklace exactly like the dead
girl wore?

1401
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:35,229
Was this just another coincidence?

1402
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:40,929
If so, it was one coincidence too many.

1403
01:27:40,929 --> 01:27:44,619
She started to cross the road then stopped,
frozen.

1404
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:49,119
A new thought had crept in.

1405
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:57,010
Was the necklace like the one Lizzie Keegan
wore, or could it actually be hers?

1406
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,510
Becky shook her head.

1407
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:03,610
Richard must have put the necklace in his
'treasure chest' more than thirty years after

1408
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:05,570
the girl died.

1409
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:07,900
It couldn't be the same one.

1410
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:09,380
Could it?

1411
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:13,820
But where did it come from?

1412
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:19,800
That night, after dinner, Becky went to sit
on the little wall at the front of the cottage

1413
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,270
hoping Richard would see her and join her.

1414
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,889
She didn't have to wait long.

1415
01:28:25,889 --> 01:28:30,710
She heard the front door of the cottage next
door open and then Richard came out of their

1416
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:33,540
gate and walked over to her.

1417
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:41,340
'Is this seat taken?' he asked very formally,
pointing at the empty space on the wall next

1418
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,239
to Becky.

1419
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:45,690
She smiled and shook her head.

1420
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:50,729
'May I?' he asked politely.

1421
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:53,090
Becky laughed and rolled her eyes.

1422
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:57,590
'Just sit down,' she said.

1423
01:28:57,590 --> 01:29:03,900
Richard sat beside her and they looked through
the tea trees at the fading light on the water.

1424
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:08,530
'I love it here,' said Becky.

1425
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:10,280
Richard looked at her.

1426
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:14,800
'Nice necklace you're wearing,' he said.

1427
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,420
Becky smiled.

1428
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:21,389
She was hoping he might mention it, that he
would introduce it into the conversation.

1429
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:24,620
'Oh, yes,' she said.

1430
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:28,179
'A rather nice young man gave it to me.'

1431
01:29:28,179 --> 01:29:32,920
'Ah, rather nice, is he?'

1432
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,920
'Yes.'

1433
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,340
Becky laughed and put her hand up to the necklace.

1434
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:43,070
'By the way, where did you get it?

1435
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:46,170
I mean, can you remember where you found it?'

1436
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,999
'Yeah,' said Richard, thinking.

1437
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:52,530
'Yeah, it was at home.

1438
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:57,730
It must have been the day before we were coming
to Rottnest and Mum had given us the biscuit

1439
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:58,730
tin.

1440
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,780
Pete and I were looking for things to fill
it.'

1441
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:07,010
'Oh, so you found it at home,' said Becky
lightly.

1442
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:09,190
'Yeah,' said Richard.

1443
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:14,780
'I remember it was in the back of the old
wardrobe in the spare room.'

1444
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,090
He laughed.

1445
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:20,179
'Pete and I used to love that big old wardrobe.

1446
01:30:20,179 --> 01:30:21,869
It was ancient.

1447
01:30:21,869 --> 01:30:25,239
It belonged to my grandfather when he was
young.

1448
01:30:25,239 --> 01:30:31,590
We used to climb inside it and shut the doors
and frighten ourselves silly in the dark.

1449
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:37,620
Anyway, Pete was swinging from the rail that
you hang your clothes on and it suddenly broke.

1450
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:42,730
He crashed his head on the side of the wardrobe
and went off crying to Mum.

1451
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:46,229
And I looked down and there was the necklace.

1452
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:49,719
I don't know where it came from.

1453
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:54,349
Maybe it was stuck in the hole where the rail
joined the wall.'

1454
01:30:54,349 --> 01:30:55,949
He looked at Becky.

1455
01:30:55,949 --> 01:31:01,260
'I never knew it would end up on such a pretty
neck, though.'

1456
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:03,840
Becky looked straight ahead at the sea.

1457
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,469
'Your grandfather's old wardrobe.'

1458
01:31:07,469 --> 01:31:08,579
She laughed lightly.

1459
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:13,710
'You know, I've just realized I don't know
your surname.'

1460
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:19,190
'It's Scanlon,' said the boy beside her.

1461
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:20,880
'Richard Scanlon.'

1462
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,489
Becky sat very still but her mind was racing.

1463
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:27,479
What was it Ruth had said?

1464
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:32,090
One of the Scanlon boys said they saw Newman
with Lizzie.

1465
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,090
Scanlon!

1466
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:37,969
Becky's head was ringing with the sound of
Ruth's voice.

1467
01:31:37,969 --> 01:31:44,199
Scanlon was the name of the boy who had accused
the lighthouse keeper!

1468
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:47,360
Slowly, Becky stood up.

1469
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:55,650
'I'm a bit cold,' she said, 'I think I'll
go inside.'

1470
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:59,670
'Oh,' said Richard, surprised.

1471
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:02,679
Carefully, Becky smiled at him.

1472
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:06,139
'Goodnight,' she said.

1473
01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:07,920
'Goodnight.'

1474
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,249
Becky went inside, her mind still racing.

1475
01:32:12,249 --> 01:32:17,039
She put on her pyjamas and lay on her bed
looking up at the ceiling.

1476
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,340
Her thoughts twisted, one around the other.

1477
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:26,709
Was Richard's grandfather the witness who
said he saw Newman with Lizzie?

1478
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:30,289
If so, had he been lying?

1479
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:33,809
And if he had, been lying, why?

1480
01:32:33,809 --> 01:32:36,729
Because he was the real murderer?

1481
01:32:36,729 --> 01:32:39,070
How old would he have been in 1961?

1482
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:46,219
He must be about seventy now, so he would
have been in his early twenties back then.

1483
01:32:46,219 --> 01:32:49,300
A strong, young man.

1484
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:52,300
Did he kill Lizzie Keegan?

1485
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,480
And point the blame somewhere else?

1486
01:32:55,480 --> 01:33:01,869
Did Radcliff find this out, tell Scanlon and
threaten to go to the police or the newspapers

1487
01:33:01,869 --> 01:33:03,159
or something?

1488
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:07,810
But then, why didn't he go to the police?

1489
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:10,789
Perhaps he only suspected Scanlon.

1490
01:33:10,789 --> 01:33:13,280
Maybe he didn't have the proof.

1491
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,510
But now the old man knew Radcliff might ruin
him.

1492
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:23,750
Suddenly Becky thought of Richard and a sick
feeling rose in her stomach.

1493
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,690
Scanlon knew.

1494
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:27,979
Did anyone else know?

1495
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:31,130
Did Richard know?

1496
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:34,340
Becky turned onto her side, her hand to her
mouth.

1497
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:37,289
A terrible thought came to her.

1498
01:33:37,289 --> 01:33:42,670
Did Richard kill Radcliff to protect his grandfather?

1499
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:45,840
Becky thought about the last few days.

1500
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:50,429
Amber and Natalie and Dominic didn't want
to talk about the body on the rocks.

1501
01:33:50,429 --> 01:33:52,380
It was only Richard.

1502
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:56,059
Richard had taken a special interest.

1503
01:33:56,059 --> 01:34:01,749
Was he really interested in helping Becky
or did he only want to find out how much she

1504
01:34:01,749 --> 01:34:03,489
knew?

1505
01:34:03,489 --> 01:34:06,860
She reached up and felt the necklace.

1506
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:11,429
She quickly sat up, took it off and threw
it on the bed.

1507
01:34:11,429 --> 01:34:15,400
She stared at it for a moment, her thoughts
slowing.

1508
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,600
This was crazy.

1509
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,739
If Richard was trying to protect his grandfather
or was guilty of anything himself, why would

1510
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:24,519
he give her the necklace?

1511
01:34:24,519 --> 01:34:30,210
And, Becky suddenly remembered with relief,
Dominic and Richard didn't arrive on the island

1512
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:34,159
until the morning the girls found the body.

1513
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:37,130
Radcliff had been killed the night before.

1514
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:39,880
It couldn't have been Richard.

1515
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,869
Richard didn't do it.

1516
01:34:42,869 --> 01:34:47,110
Becky lay down again and before long, she
was asleep.

1517
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:53,590
That night she dreamed she was Lizzie Keegan.

1518
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:54,800
Lizzie!

1519
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,020
Lizzie!

1520
01:34:56,020 --> 01:35:00,130
Someone was calling her name.

1521
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:01,130
It was dark.

1522
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,130
Where was she?

1523
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:05,829
She was running, trying to get away.

1524
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:07,830
Come on, Lizzie!

1525
01:35:07,830 --> 01:35:11,179
The voice was getting closer.

1526
01:35:11,179 --> 01:35:12,959
Let's have some fun!

1527
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:16,999
She was on the sand, digging.

1528
01:35:16,999 --> 01:35:21,519
If she could just dig a big hole, she could
get away.

1529
01:35:21,519 --> 01:35:25,800
But the sand kept sliding back into the hole.

1530
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:32,440
The faster she dug, the faster it fell back
in.

1531
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,440
Lizzie!

1532
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,440
Lizzie!

1533
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,860
She was crying now, crying and digging.

1534
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:41,550
She felt hands around her neck.

1535
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:43,789
She felt them tighten.

1536
01:35:43,789 --> 01:35:47,010
Shh, Lizzie.

1537
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:56,000
Come on, shh!

1538
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,190
CHAPTER ELEVEN
The tunnel

1539
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:02,610
'Becky, wake up.'

1540
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:06,139
Becky rolled over and looked towards the door.

1541
01:36:06,139 --> 01:36:07,289
It was Natalie.

1542
01:36:07,289 --> 01:36:09,139
'You slept in.

1543
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:12,139
It's nearly ten o'clock.'

1544
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:18,219
Natalie picked up some clothes from a chair
in the corner and threw them onto the bed.

1545
01:36:18,219 --> 01:36:20,090
Becky rubbed her eyes.

1546
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:22,409
'You have to get dressed,' said Natalie.

1547
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:27,539
'We've arranged with Richard and Dominic to
ride to Oliver Hill.'

1548
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:31,409
'Oliver Hill?' asked Becky.

1549
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:34,619
She was still lying down and her eyes were
closed.

1550
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:36,320
'Yeah,' said Natalie.

1551
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:41,889
'You know, there's a big gun on the hill from
World War Two.'

1552
01:36:41,889 --> 01:36:43,929
Becky opened one eye.

1553
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:47,119
'We're going to see the gun?'

1554
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:51,289
Natalie laughed, grabbed Becky's arm and dragged
her up.

1555
01:36:51,289 --> 01:36:53,310
'Come on,' she said.

1556
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:56,380
'It's not just the gun.

1557
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,249
There are secret tunnels underneath it.

1558
01:36:58,249 --> 01:37:03,900
If we get there by eleven, we can go on a
tour of the tunnels.'

1559
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,739
Becky sat on the edge of the bed.

1560
01:37:05,739 --> 01:37:09,139
'It's all arranged,' said Natalie.

1561
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:10,500
'Hey, Nat!'

1562
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,989
called Amber from the verandah.

1563
01:37:12,989 --> 01:37:13,989
'Yeah?'

1564
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:16,369
Natalie walked to the door.

1565
01:37:16,369 --> 01:37:17,789
She turned back to Becky.

1566
01:37:17,789 --> 01:37:20,959
'We need to leave in fifteen minutes, okay?'

1567
01:37:20,959 --> 01:37:25,749
she said and then walked out of the room.

1568
01:37:25,749 --> 01:37:29,400
Wide awake now, Becky slowly dressed.

1569
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:32,639
She looked at the necklace lying on the sheets.

1570
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,420
She tried to stay calm.

1571
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:40,449
She needed to go to the police to tell them
about Richard's grandfather but first she

1572
01:37:40,449 --> 01:37:43,590
wanted to be absolutely sure that she was
right.

1573
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:49,980
She picked up the necklace and put it on.

1574
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:54,269
Riding to Oliver Hill, Richard stayed close
to Becky.

1575
01:37:54,269 --> 01:38:00,239
They would all race down a hill or sometimes
stop to look at something, but he would always

1576
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:02,179
find his way back to her side.

1577
01:38:02,179 --> 01:38:08,959
His smile seemed secret and special, just
for her.

1578
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:14,119
As they joined the tour group to look at the
gun and the, underground tunnels beneath it,

1579
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:16,130
Becky watched Richard.

1580
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:19,050
He said something funny to make the crowd
laugh.

1581
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:23,979
He was so good-looking, so charming.

1582
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:27,139
He caught her looking at him, and smiled.

1583
01:38:27,139 --> 01:38:33,849
Their guide, an elderly man called Keith,
led them around the large base of the nine-inch

1584
01:38:33,849 --> 01:38:40,309
gun and then up to the gun itself, explaining
how it worked and giving the history of the

1585
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:43,050
army on the island.

1586
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:48,999
Then they started down a long set of shallow
steps which led to the entrance to the underground

1587
01:38:48,999 --> 01:38:50,880
tunnels.

1588
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:56,130
Becky was walking behind Amber and Dominic
and Richard and Natalie were behind her.

1589
01:38:56,130 --> 01:39:04,110
'Now,' said Keith, 'the tunnels are quite
narrow and dark in places so I hope no one's

1590
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:05,510
claustrophobic.'

1591
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:08,119
'I don't like small spaces.

1592
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:13,239
I might be a bit claustrophobic, said Amber
quietly.

1593
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,380
'Don't worry.

1594
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:17,789
I'll look after you,' said Dominic.

1595
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:21,309
'You get seasick and you're claustrophobic?'

1596
01:39:21,309 --> 01:39:22,710
asked Natalie.

1597
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:28,409
'I got seasick coming over on the ferry,'
Amber explained to Dominic.

1598
01:39:28,409 --> 01:39:32,190
'Yeah, it can get a bit rough,' he replied.

1599
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,689
'I'm not a good sailor, either.

1600
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:35,189
Not like him.'

1601
01:39:35,189 --> 01:39:37,610
He pointed back at Richard.

1602
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:42,229
'He sails across here all the time on his
grandfather's yacht.'

1603
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:43,851
Becky glanced quickly back at Richard.

1604
01:39:43,851 --> 01:39:44,851
'Your grandfather has a yacht?'

1605
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:45,851
she asked lightly.

1606
01:39:45,851 --> 01:39:46,851
'Yeah,' he answered.

1607
01:39:46,851 --> 01:39:47,851
'It's a beauty,' said Dominic.

1608
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:48,851
They had reached the bottom of the steps.

1609
01:39:48,851 --> 01:39:49,851
Keith began talking again.

1610
01:39:49,851 --> 01:39:50,851
'But you both came on the ferry the other
day, didn't you?'

1611
01:39:50,851 --> 01:39:51,851
whispered Becky.

1612
01:39:51,851 --> 01:39:52,851
'No,' said Dominic, trying to listen to the
guide.

1613
01:39:52,851 --> 01:39:53,851
'Rich sailed over with his grandfather a few
days before I arrived.'

1614
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:54,851
The group moved forward and entered the first
tunnel.

1615
01:39:54,851 --> 01:39:55,851
Becky's mind was racing again.

1616
01:39:55,851 --> 01:39:56,851
The guide's voice seemed a long way away.

1617
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:57,851
'If any of the soldiers working the gun were
hurt, this is the place...'

1618
01:39:57,851 --> 01:39:58,851
Becky stopped listening altogether.

1619
01:39:58,851 --> 01:39:59,851
So Richard and his grandfather were both on
the island when the murder was committed.

1620
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:00,851
Either one of them could have killed Radcliff.

1621
01:40:00,851 --> 01:40:01,851
Or both.

1622
01:40:01,851 --> 01:40:02,851
Becky had never felt claustrophobic before,
but now the tunnel walls seemed too close

1623
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:03,851
and she couldn't get enough air.

1624
01:40:03,851 --> 01:40:04,851
The first tunnel ended and the group could
go either right or left.

1625
01:40:04,851 --> 01:40:05,851
Keith led them down the tunnel to the right.

1626
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:06,851
It turned a corner and led into a large room.

1627
01:40:06,851 --> 01:40:07,851
There was a glass case showing some things
used during the war.

1628
01:40:07,851 --> 01:40:08,851
Becky found herself face-to-face with a gas
mask - its hollow eyes staring at her, its

1629
01:40:08,851 --> 01:40:09,851
strange round mouth crying out.

1630
01:40:09,851 --> 01:40:10,851
Richard was beside her.

1631
01:40:10,851 --> 01:40:11,851
'Imagine wearing that,' he said.

1632
01:40:11,851 --> 01:40:12,851
Becky didn't take her eyes off the gas mask.

1633
01:40:12,851 --> 01:40:13,851
She needed to go to the police now.

1634
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:14,851
She needed to go back.

1635
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:15,851
'Now,' said Keith, 'if you'll follow me out
into the next tunnel, you'll see a uniform

1636
01:40:15,851 --> 01:40:16,851
hanging on the wall.'

1637
01:40:16,851 --> 01:40:17,851
The group started moving.

1638
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:18,851
Becky stayed where she was.

1639
01:40:18,851 --> 01:40:19,851
'The men couldn't wear their uniforms into
the next room we're going to look at,' continued

1640
01:40:19,851 --> 01:40:20,851
Keith.

1641
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:21,851
'They had to change into other clothes here
- clothes without buttons or metal of any

1642
01:40:21,851 --> 01:40:22,851
kind.

1643
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:23,851
The smallest spark from the metal could cause
an explosion...'

1644
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:24,851
His voice faded into the distance.

1645
01:40:24,851 --> 01:40:25,851
Becky was alone.

1646
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:26,851
She waited a moment and then walked towards
the door.

1647
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:27,851
Suddenly Richard appeared.

1648
01:40:27,851 --> 01:40:28,851
'What are you doing?' he said.

1649
01:40:28,851 --> 01:40:29,851
'Nothing,' she answered.

1650
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:30,851
He smiled, grabbed her hand and dragged her
to the other side of the room.

1651
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:31,851
He spun her around so that her back was against
the wall.

1652
01:40:31,851 --> 01:40:32,851
He touched her face and moved closer He smiled.

1653
01:40:32,851 --> 01:40:33,851
His hand moved down to her neck.

1654
01:40:33,851 --> 01:40:34,851
Becky wanted to cry out but she couldn't.

1655
01:40:34,851 --> 01:40:35,851
She was frozen with fear.

1656
01:40:35,851 --> 01:40:36,851
He was going to kill her.

1657
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:37,851
Suddenly she pushed his hand down and tried
to get away.

1658
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:38,851
He grabbed her around the waist and held her.

1659
01:40:38,851 --> 01:40:39,851
'Come on, Becky.

1660
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:40,851
Don't go.'

1661
01:40:40,851 --> 01:40:41,851
She broke away and ran out of the room.

1662
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:42,851
Is this what happened to Lizzie Keegan all
those years ago?

1663
01:40:42,851 --> 01:40:43,851
Richard called after her.

1664
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:44,851
She ran down the tunnel, hoping to find her
way back to the entrance.

1665
01:40:44,851 --> 01:40:45,851
She heard footsteps behind her.

1666
01:40:45,851 --> 01:40:46,851
She kept running.

1667
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:47,851
Then the tunnel started going steeply downhill.

1668
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:48,851
This was wrong - this wasn't the way to the
entrance!

1669
01:40:48,851 --> 01:40:49,851
Richard's voice was calling in a sharp whisper
somewhere behind her.

1670
01:40:49,851 --> 01:40:50,851
'Becky!

1671
01:40:50,851 --> 01:40:51,851
Becky!'

1672
01:40:51,851 --> 01:40:52,851
She couldn't turn back.

1673
01:40:52,851 --> 01:40:53,851
She kept going down the tunnel, deeper and
deeper into the earth.

1674
01:40:53,851 --> 01:40:54,851
There were a few lights on the low ceiling
but they weren't bright.

1675
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:55,851
She was always running into darkness.

1676
01:40:55,851 --> 01:40:56,851
The tunnel seemed to go on and on.

1677
01:40:56,851 --> 01:40:57,851
Then suddenly she came to a room full of machines.

1678
01:40:57,851 --> 01:40:58,851
She stopped and looked around but the only
escape was the continuing tunnel on the other

1679
01:40:58,851 --> 01:40:59,851
side.

1680
01:40:59,851 --> 01:41:00,851
Richard's footsteps were getting closer and
louder.

1681
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:01,851
Becky ran.

1682
01:41:01,851 --> 01:41:02,851
The tunnel went downwards again and then became
level.

1683
01:41:02,851 --> 01:41:03,851
And suddenly Becky could see a door.

1684
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:04,851
Did it lead outside?

1685
01:41:04,851 --> 01:41:05,851
Please don't be locked, she prayed.

1686
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:06,851
Please let me out!

1687
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:07,851
She threw herself at the door, turned the
handle and burst out into the midday sun.

1688
01:41:07,851 --> 01:41:08,851
For a moment, she was blinded by the light.

1689
01:41:08,851 --> 01:41:09,851
Her foot struck something metal and she fell
forward onto the sand.

1690
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:10,851
'Are you all right?' asked a man's voice.

1691
01:41:10,851 --> 01:41:11,851
'Let me help you.'

1692
01:41:11,851 --> 01:41:12,851
Strong arms helped her to her feet.

1693
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:13,851
She looked up into the man's face.

1694
01:41:13,851 --> 01:41:14,851
He was wearing a red and white cap.

1695
01:41:14,851 --> 01:41:15,851
Richard burst out of the tunnel.

1696
01:41:15,851 --> 01:41:16,851
'Granddad!' he said.

1697
01:41:16,851 --> 01:41:17,851
CHAPTER TWELVE
Ho escape?

1698
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:18,851
'Richard?' said his grandfather, smiling.

1699
01:41:18,851 --> 01:41:19,851
'You're not chasing this poor girl, are you?'

1700
01:41:19,851 --> 01:41:20,851
He still held Becky's arms.

1701
01:41:20,851 --> 01:41:21,851
He may have been old but he was obviously
still strong and fit.

1702
01:41:21,851 --> 01:41:22,851
His skin was brown from the sun.

1703
01:41:22,851 --> 01:41:23,851
Richard stood bent over with his hands on
his knees, trying to get his breath.

1704
01:41:23,851 --> 01:41:24,851
'Why did you run like that, Becky?' he gasped.

1705
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:25,851
'I thought you liked me.

1706
01:41:25,851 --> 01:41:26,851
I didn't mean to...'

1707
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:27,851
But Becky wasn't listening.

1708
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:28,851
She was looking at the old man.

1709
01:41:28,851 --> 01:41:29,851
His smile had dropped away and he was staring
at her in horror - not at her face, but at

1710
01:41:29,851 --> 01:41:30,851
her neck and the little gold heart on the
chain.

1711
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:31,851
Instantly she knew that she was right - that
it was he who had killed Lizzie Keegan.

1712
01:41:31,851 --> 01:41:32,851
'It was you,' she breathed.

1713
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:33,851
His fingers tightened around her arms but
he smiled broadly.

1714
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:34,851
'You'd better introduce us,' he said to Richard,
not taking his eyes off Becky.

1715
01:41:34,851 --> 01:41:35,851
'Oh, yeah.

1716
01:41:35,851 --> 01:41:36,851
Sorry,' replied Richard.

1717
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:37,851
'This is Becky.

1718
01:41:37,851 --> 01:41:38,851
Becky, this is my grandfather, Charles Scanlon.'

1719
01:41:38,851 --> 01:41:39,851
But the words were hardly out of his mouth
before Becky started shouting.

1720
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:40,851
'It was you!'

1721
01:41:40,851 --> 01:41:41,851
she said to the old man.

1722
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:42,851
'You did it!

1723
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:43,851
All alone the first time.

1724
01:41:43,851 --> 01:41:44,851
And then what?

1725
01:41:44,851 --> 01:41:45,851
You got him to help you the second time?'

1726
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:46,851
She turned her head to look at Richard.

1727
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:47,851
'Is that what happened?

1728
01:41:47,851 --> 01:41:48,851
The second murder to cover up the first?'

1729
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:49,851
Richard stared at her.

1730
01:41:49,851 --> 01:41:50,851
'Becky?

1731
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:51,851
What are you talking about?'

1732
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:52,851
Scanlon kept smiling.

1733
01:41:52,851 --> 01:41:53,851
'Well, you've found yourself an interesting
one here, Richard,' he said.

1734
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:54,851
'Although she doesn't seem to be talking a
lot of sense.'

1735
01:41:54,851 --> 01:41:55,851
His fingers dug into her flesh 'In fact, she
seems a little mad.'

1736
01:41:55,851 --> 01:41:56,851
'You're hurting me,' cried Becky.

1737
01:41:56,851 --> 01:41:57,851
She looked around her.

1738
01:41:57,851 --> 01:41:58,851
They were standing on an old railway track
surrounded by sand and a group of dead trees

1739
01:41:58,851 --> 01:41:59,851
- their bare black branches like something
out of a bad dream.

1740
01:41:59,851 --> 01:42:00,851
Where were they?

1741
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:01,851
The tunnel had seemed to go deep underground,
so where had they come out?

1742
01:42:01,851 --> 01:42:02,851
Were they at the bottom of Oliver Hill?

1743
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:03,851
Was anybody near?

1744
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:04,851
Would they hear her if she screamed?

1745
01:42:04,851 --> 01:42:05,851
Richard moved forward.

1746
01:42:05,851 --> 01:42:06,851
'Granddad?

1747
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:07,851
You're hurting her arms.'

1748
01:42:07,851 --> 01:42:08,851
Scanlon released her.

1749
01:42:08,851 --> 01:42:09,851
'Becky, calm down,' said Richard.

1750
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:10,851
'Why are you shouting?'

1751
01:42:10,851 --> 01:42:11,851
'Don't pretend you don't know,' Becky cried.

1752
01:42:11,851 --> 01:42:12,851
'Don't pretend you don't know your grandfather
killed Lizzie Keegan!'

1753
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:13,851
'What!' said Richard.

1754
01:42:13,851 --> 01:42:14,851
'My grandfather?'

1755
01:42:14,851 --> 01:42:15,851
He started to laugh.

1756
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:16,851
'What are you talking about?'

1757
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:17,851
Becky grabbed the necklace and pulled it from
her neck.

1758
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:18,851
She held it up in front of his face.

1759
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:19,851
'This is hers.

1760
01:42:19,851 --> 01:42:20,851
It belonged to her.'

1761
01:42:20,851 --> 01:42:21,851
She searched his face for any sign of understanding.

1762
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:22,851
There was none.

1763
01:42:22,851 --> 01:42:23,851
'Becky, what are you talking about?' he said.

1764
01:42:23,851 --> 01:42:24,851
'This is crazy.'

1765
01:42:24,851 --> 01:42:25,851
Then she knew.

1766
01:42:25,851 --> 01:42:26,851
'No, I was wrong, Richard,' she said.

1767
01:42:26,851 --> 01:42:27,851
'It wasn't you.'

1768
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:28,851
She turned and pointed at Scanlon.

1769
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:29,851
'It was only him.

1770
01:42:29,851 --> 01:42:30,851
He did it all.'

1771
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:31,851
'She is crazy,' said Scanlon.

1772
01:42:31,851 --> 01:42:32,851
'Come on, Richard.

1773
01:42:32,851 --> 01:42:33,851
Let's get out of here.'

1774
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:34,851
'Richard, it was him!'

1775
01:42:34,851 --> 01:42:35,851
Becky cried.

1776
01:42:35,851 --> 01:42:36,851
'Do you remember the other night when I told
you what those women told me about Lizzie

1777
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:37,851
Keegan's death?'

1778
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:38,851
She didn't wait for an answer.

1779
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:39,851
'Well, I didn't say who the chief witness
was - who it was who pointed the finger at

1780
01:42:39,851 --> 01:42:40,851
Newman.

1781
01:42:40,851 --> 01:42:41,851
One of the women, Ruth, remembered quite clearly.

1782
01:42:41,851 --> 01:42:42,851
It was one of the Scanlon boys, she said.'

1783
01:42:42,851 --> 01:42:43,851
She spun around to look at the old man.

1784
01:42:43,851 --> 01:42:44,851
'How old were you, Mr Scanlon?

1785
01:42:44,851 --> 01:42:45,851
How old were you in 1961?'

1786
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:46,851
Again, she didn't wait for an answer.

1787
01:42:46,851 --> 01:42:47,851
She swung back to Richard.

1788
01:42:47,851 --> 01:42:48,851
'And do you know why Ruth remembered it so
well?

1789
01:42:48,851 --> 01:42:49,851
Lizzie Keegan was her sister!'

1790
01:42:49,851 --> 01:42:50,851
'This is ridiculous!'

1791
01:42:50,851 --> 01:42:51,851
exploded Scanlon.

1792
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:52,851
'I don't know who this friend of yours is,
Richard, but I'm not going to stand here and

1793
01:42:52,851 --> 01:42:53,851
listen to this rubbish any longer.'

1794
01:42:53,851 --> 01:42:54,851
'He's the man in the cap, Richard,' Becky
cried.

1795
01:42:54,851 --> 01:42:55,851
'The man who was following me.'

1796
01:42:55,851 --> 01:42:56,851
'Following you?' said Scanlon scornfully.

1797
01:42:56,851 --> 01:42:57,851
'Don't be ridiculous, girl.

1798
01:42:57,851 --> 01:42:58,851
Why would I be following you?'

1799
01:42:58,851 --> 01:42:59,851
'So, why are you here?'

1800
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:00,851
Becky shouted.

1801
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:01,851
'Why were you waiting outside the door to
the tunnel?'

1802
01:43:01,851 --> 01:43:02,851
'Oh dear, oh dear,' said Scanlon.

1803
01:43:02,851 --> 01:43:03,851
He spoke slowly, as if he was talking to an
unreasonable child.

1804
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:04,851
'I was waiting for my old friend, Keith, who
is a tour guide here.

1805
01:43:04,851 --> 01:43:05,851
We'd arranged to meet to catch up with each
other between tours.'

1806
01:43:05,851 --> 01:43:06,851
For a moment, Becky hesitated.

1807
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:07,851
Then she recovered.

1808
01:43:07,851 --> 01:43:08,851
'Maybe that's true,' she said.

1809
01:43:08,851 --> 01:43:09,851
'But it doesn't change anything.'

1810
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:10,851
'I've had enough of this,' Scanlon said.

1811
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:11,851
'Come on, Richard,' he ordered.

1812
01:43:11,851 --> 01:43:12,851
But before Richard could move, they all heard
voices in the tunnel.

1813
01:43:12,851 --> 01:43:13,851
The tour was coming to an end.

1814
01:43:13,851 --> 01:43:14,851
'Aren't you going to wait for your friend
Keith?' said Becky.

1815
01:43:14,851 --> 01:43:15,851
'I'm sure he'd like to hear all about Lizzie
Keegan and John Radcliff.'

1816
01:43:15,851 --> 01:43:16,851
'Becky, stop this!' said Richard.

1817
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:17,851
'For God's sake, girl,' said Scanlon.

1818
01:43:17,851 --> 01:43:18,851
Richard looked at him.

1819
01:43:18,851 --> 01:43:19,851
There was a look in his grandfather's eyes
he had never seen before - a look of fear.

1820
01:43:19,851 --> 01:43:20,851
Becky didn't stop.

1821
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:21,851
Her voice got louder and louder as the tour
group, one by one, came slowly out of the

1822
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:22,851
tunnel.

1823
01:43:22,851 --> 01:43:23,851
'John Radcliff was Leslie Newman's son, wasn't
he?'

1824
01:43:23,851 --> 01:43:24,851
she shouted.

1825
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:25,851
'Did he always know that you killed her?

1826
01:43:25,851 --> 01:43:26,851
Or did he only find out recently?

1827
01:43:26,851 --> 01:43:27,851
Did he threaten to tell everyone that you
murdered Lizzie Keegan?

1828
01:43:27,851 --> 01:43:28,851
Is that why you killed him?'

1829
01:43:28,851 --> 01:43:29,851
'Charles?'

1830
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:30,851
It was Keith.

1831
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:31,851
Everyone was out of the tunnel now, standing
in little groups.

1832
01:43:31,851 --> 01:43:32,851
Amber, Natalie and Dominic stared at Becky.

1833
01:43:32,851 --> 01:43:33,851
'Charles, what's going on here?'

1834
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:34,851
Scanlon threw his arms up in the air and smiled
broadly at Keith.

1835
01:43:34,851 --> 01:43:35,851
'I have no idea.

1836
01:43:35,851 --> 01:43:36,851
It's ridiculous!

1837
01:43:36,851 --> 01:43:37,851
I was just standing here, waiting for you,
when this girl came running out of the tunnel

1838
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:38,851
shouting and screaming.

1839
01:43:38,851 --> 01:43:39,851
She seems to think I'm someone else.

1840
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:40,851
He tapped his head.

1841
01:43:40,851 --> 01:43:41,851
'She's a bit mixed-up.'

1842
01:43:41,851 --> 01:43:42,851
'I'm not mixed-up,' cried Becky.

1843
01:43:42,851 --> 01:43:43,851
'I know exactly what I'm saying.

1844
01:43:43,851 --> 01:43:44,851
You have to believe me.'

1845
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:45,851
She went over to Keith.

1846
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:46,851
'Listen,' she said.

1847
01:43:46,851 --> 01:43:47,851
'Did you use to come to Rottnest when you
were young?

1848
01:43:47,851 --> 01:43:48,851
Did you ever hear about a girl called.

1849
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:49,851
Lizzie Keegan?

1850
01:43:49,851 --> 01:43:50,851
In 1961.'

1851
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:51,851
'The girl who was murdered?' asked Keith slowly.

1852
01:43:51,851 --> 01:43:52,851
'Yes.

1853
01:43:52,851 --> 01:43:53,851
Yes.

1854
01:43:53,851 --> 01:43:54,851
Do you remember who told the police he saw
the lighthouse keeper with Lizzie?'

1855
01:43:54,851 --> 01:43:55,851
'Well,' said Keith, 'actually, it was Charles.

1856
01:43:55,851 --> 01:43:56,851
But -'

1857
01:43:56,851 --> 01:43:57,851
Becky didn't let him finish.

1858
01:43:57,851 --> 01:43:58,851
She held the necklace up for all to see.

1859
01:43:58,851 --> 01:43:59,851
'The girl was wearing a necklace when she
died, but it wasn't there when they found

1860
01:43:59,851 --> 01:44:00,851
her body.

1861
01:44:00,851 --> 01:44:01,851
The necklace looked like this.'

1862
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:02,851
Then she turned and walked towards Richard.

1863
01:44:02,851 --> 01:44:03,851
'Except it didn't just look like this necklace.

1864
01:44:03,851 --> 01:44:04,851
It was this necklace.'

1865
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:05,851
She stopped shouting.

1866
01:44:05,851 --> 01:44:06,851
'This necklace was buried in a tin for more
than ten years, and before that it was found

1867
01:44:06,851 --> 01:44:07,851
in the back of a wardrobe!'

1868
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:08,851
She pointed at Scanlon.

1869
01:44:08,851 --> 01:44:09,851
'A wardrobe belonging to him!'

1870
01:44:09,851 --> 01:44:10,851
'Don't be ridiculous,' said Richard.

1871
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:11,851
'It can't be the same necklace.'

1872
01:44:11,851 --> 01:44:12,851
'Ruth Keegan recognised it as soon as she
saw it,' said Becky.

1873
01:44:12,851 --> 01:44:13,851
'You'd never seen it in the wardrobe before,
had you?

1874
01:44:13,851 --> 01:44:14,851
It was hidden there!'

1875
01:44:14,851 --> 01:44:15,851
Richard looked at Becky, then at his grandfather.

1876
01:44:15,851 --> 01:44:16,851
Scanlon tried to laugh.

1877
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:17,851
'I don't believe this.

1878
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:18,851
You're not going to listen to this crazy girl,
are you?

1879
01:44:18,851 --> 01:44:19,851
Sorry about this, Keith.

1880
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:20,851
I don't know who she is or what she's talking
about, but I think it might be best if you

1881
01:44:20,851 --> 01:44:21,851
take your tour group back up to the top of
the tunnels.

1882
01:44:21,851 --> 01:44:22,851
Richard and I can deal with this.'

1883
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:23,851
But nobody moved.

1884
01:44:23,851 --> 01:44:24,851
Except Richard.

1885
01:44:24,851 --> 01:44:25,851
Very slowly, he took the necklace from Becky
and walked towards his grandfather.

1886
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:26,851
'It's not true, is it?' he asked quietly.

1887
01:44:26,851 --> 01:44:27,851
'For God's sake, boy,' said Scanlon.

1888
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:28,851
'I'm your grandfather.

1889
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:29,851
She's crazy.

1890
01:44:29,851 --> 01:44:30,851
She's all mixed-up.'

1891
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:31,851
'But I did find the necklace in your old wardrobe.

1892
01:44:31,851 --> 01:44:32,851
Where did it come from?'

1893
01:44:32,851 --> 01:44:33,851
Scanlon threw up his hands.

1894
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:34,851
'How should I know?'

1895
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:35,851
'And where were you on Saturday night?'

1896
01:44:35,851 --> 01:44:36,851
Richard continued softly.

1897
01:44:36,851 --> 01:44:37,851
'You said you were going for a drink at the
hotel and later I thought I'd join you.

1898
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:38,851
But when I got there, I looked everywhere
and couldn't find you.

1899
01:44:38,851 --> 01:44:39,851
Where did you go?'

1900
01:44:39,851 --> 01:44:40,851
Every pair of eyes in the gathering was on
Scanlon.

1901
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:41,851
'For a walk,' he said shortly.

1902
01:44:41,851 --> 01:44:42,851
There was a pause.

1903
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:43,851
'For a walk to kill Radcliff?'

1904
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:44,851
asked Richard.

1905
01:44:44,851 --> 01:44:45,851
His grandfather's eyes narrowed.

1906
01:44:45,851 --> 01:44:46,851
His voice dropped low.

1907
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:47,851
'Be careful, boy.

1908
01:44:47,851 --> 01:44:48,851
Remember your name is Scanlon too.

1909
01:44:48,851 --> 01:44:49,851
Do you want it dragged through the mud?'

1910
01:44:49,851 --> 01:44:50,851
He grabbed the necklace.

1911
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:51,851
'I've had enough of this!' he said and turned
to go.

1912
01:44:51,851 --> 01:44:52,851
Richard stared at him for a moment and then
suddenly ran after him.

1913
01:44:52,851 --> 01:44:53,851
He grabbed his grandfather's arm and tried
to get the necklace.

1914
01:44:53,851 --> 01:44:54,851
The old man struggled with him.

1915
01:44:54,851 --> 01:44:55,851
He didn't want to let it go.

1916
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:56,851
He was strong, but his grandson was stronger.

1917
01:44:56,851 --> 01:44:57,851
Richard forced his hand open and took the
necklace away from him.

1918
01:44:57,851 --> 01:44:58,851
He held it up to his grandfather's face.

1919
01:44:58,851 --> 01:44:59,851
'Tell me this isn't Lizzie Keegan's!' he shouted.

1920
01:44:59,851 --> 01:45:00,851
'Tell me you didn't do it!

1921
01:45:00,851 --> 01:45:01,851
Tell me!

1922
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:02,851
Tell me!'

1923
01:45:02,851 --> 01:45:03,851
With the hand that held the necklace, Richard
punched at his grandfather's chest.

1924
01:45:03,851 --> 01:45:04,851
'Tell me!

1925
01:45:04,851 --> 01:45:05,851
Tell me!'

1926
01:45:05,851 --> 01:45:06,851
'It was a mistake!'

1927
01:45:06,851 --> 01:45:07,851
cried the old man, putting his hands up to
try to protect himself.

1928
01:45:07,851 --> 01:45:08,851
'My life was just getting started.

1929
01:45:08,851 --> 01:45:09,851
I didn't mean to hurt her!

1930
01:45:09,851 --> 01:45:10,851
It was all a mistake!'

1931
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:11,851
Richard's hand froze in mid-air and his grandfather
looked at the ground.

1932
01:45:11,851 --> 01:45:12,851
The two men stood defeated, the necklace hanging
between them.

1933
01:45:12,851 --> 01:45:13,851
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Wealth and influence

1934
01:45:13,851 --> 01:45:14,851
Three days later Becky and Amber sat on the
verandah of the cottage eating a late breakfast.

1935
01:45:14,851 --> 01:45:15,851
'I still can't believe you stood up to Scanlon
like that,' said Amber.

1936
01:45:15,851 --> 01:45:16,851
And that you thought Richard was trying to
kill you.

1937
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:17,851
You must have been so frightened.'

1938
01:45:17,851 --> 01:45:18,851
'It all happened so fast,' said Becky.

1939
01:45:18,851 --> 01:45:19,851
She stood up and walked a few steps down the
yard to look at the empty cottage next door.

1940
01:45:19,851 --> 01:45:20,851
They heard Natalie returning.

1941
01:45:20,851 --> 01:45:21,851
'I've got it,' she called.

1942
01:45:21,851 --> 01:45:22,851
She came outside holding the morning newspaper.

1943
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:23,851
'It's on the front page again,' she said,
dropping into a chair.

1944
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:24,851
'And page four and page five.

1945
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:25,851
Scanlon's confessed everything.

1946
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:26,851
They searched his boat and found Leslie Tavis
Newman's diary from the time the girl was

1947
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:27,851
killed.

1948
01:45:27,851 --> 01:45:28,851
Apparently Scanlon took it from Radcliff before
he killed him.

1949
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:29,851
Listen to this.'

1950
01:45:29,851 --> 01:45:30,851
Becky moved to sit down as Natalie read from
the newspaper.

1951
01:45:30,851 --> 01:45:31,851
'"It is clear from the diary that Leslie Newman
knew the Keegan family," said Detective Troy

1952
01:45:31,851 --> 01:45:32,851
Jameson late yesterday afternoon.

1953
01:45:32,851 --> 01:45:33,851
"However, Newman denies having killed the
girl."

1954
01:45:33,851 --> 01:45:34,851
In the diary, Newman also describes his feelings
of hopelessness after being accused and says

1955
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:35,851
that he feels unable to stand up to a family
of wealth and influence like the Scanlon's.

1956
01:45:35,851 --> 01:45:36,851
He is deeply upset by the effect of the scandal
on his family.

1957
01:45:36,851 --> 01:45:37,851
He writes that at the time Charles Scanlon
said he had seen him with Lizzie Keegan, Newman

1958
01:45:37,851 --> 01:45:38,851
had, in fact, been playing on the beach with
his son.

1959
01:45:38,851 --> 01:45:39,851
He remembers seeing a Keegan girl in the distance
but it wasn't Lizzie.

1960
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:40,851
It was her younger sister, Ruth Keegan.'

1961
01:45:40,851 --> 01:45:41,851
Natalie put the paper down.

1962
01:45:41,851 --> 01:45:42,851
'He saw Ruth?' said Becky, puzzled.

1963
01:45:42,851 --> 01:45:43,851
'Did she mention that she saw him?' asked
Natalie.

1964
01:45:43,851 --> 01:45:44,851
'No,' said Becky.

1965
01:45:44,851 --> 01:45:45,851
She looked at the newspaper.

1966
01:45:45,851 --> 01:45:46,851
'I'd better go and see her.

1967
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:47,851
She'll be upset if she's seen this.'

1968
01:45:47,851 --> 01:45:48,851
Becky read a bit more of the newspaper story
and then went over the road to see Ruth.

1969
01:45:48,851 --> 01:45:49,851
She was down on the beach, Shirl told her,
not far from the cottages.

1970
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:50,851
Becky went to find her.

1971
01:45:50,851 --> 01:45:51,851
'The police wanted to see me yesterday,' said
Ruth as Becky sat down next to her on the

1972
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:52,851
sand.

1973
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:53,851
'Have you read the newspaper?'

1974
01:45:53,851 --> 01:45:54,851
'Yes,' said Becky.

1975
01:45:54,851 --> 01:45:55,851
'Radcliff was his mother's maiden name,' said
Ruth, looking out at the sea.

1976
01:45:55,851 --> 01:45:56,851
Becky nodded.

1977
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:57,851
'I suppose she changed her name because of
the scandal.

1978
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:58,851
And the horror of it all.'

1979
01:45:58,851 --> 01:45:59,851
Becky looked at her.

1980
01:45:59,851 --> 01:46:00,851
'Are you all right, Ruth?'

1981
01:46:00,851 --> 01:46:01,851
Ruth didn't answer the question.

1982
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:02,851
'She never really recovered,' she said, 'and
she never told John Radcliff about his father's

1983
01:46:02,851 --> 01:46:03,851
diary.

1984
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:04,851
He only found it about a month ago, when his
mother died.

1985
01:46:04,851 --> 01:46:05,851
Apparently, before that he didn't know it
existed.

1986
01:46:05,851 --> 01:46:06,851
The police got the story from a neighbour.'

1987
01:46:06,851 --> 01:46:07,851
Ruth let out a long breath.

1988
01:46:07,851 --> 01:46:08,851
'After Radcliff read the diary he couldn't
stop talking about what he thought he'd discovered.

1989
01:46:08,851 --> 01:46:09,851
He told anyone who'd listen that he was going
to talk to Scanlon and find out the truth.

1990
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:10,851
Apparently, no one really believed him.

1991
01:46:10,851 --> 01:46:11,851
They thought he was just an ex-criminal talking
big.'

1992
01:46:11,851 --> 01:46:12,851
A man and a boy ran into the water in front
of them.

1993
01:46:12,851 --> 01:46:13,851
'But he did go to see Scanlon,' said Becky.

1994
01:46:13,851 --> 01:46:14,851
'At his house.'

1995
01:46:14,851 --> 01:46:15,851
'Yes,' replied Ruth.

1996
01:46:15,851 --> 01:46:16,851
They watched the man and the boy playing.'

1997
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:17,851
'The police think John Radcliff came to Rottnest
to find me,' she said quietly.

1998
01:46:17,851 --> 01:46:18,851
'Because, in his diary, Newman said he saw
you that day?

1999
01:46:18,851 --> 01:46:19,851
And thought you could clear his name?'

2000
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:20,851
'Yes.

2001
01:46:20,851 --> 01:46:21,851
The police said Radcliff told his neighbour
that all he needed was to "find this woman,

2002
01:46:21,851 --> 01:46:22,851
Ruth Keegan.

2003
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:23,851
She must remember seeing my father that day".'

2004
01:46:23,851 --> 01:46:24,851
'And he told Scanlon,' said Becky, nodding.

2005
01:46:24,851 --> 01:46:25,851
'And Scanlon got scared and followed Radcliff
to Rottnest.'

2006
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:26,851
The man and the boy sat down at the water's
edge.

2007
01:46:26,851 --> 01:46:27,851
'Scanlon probably couldn't believe his luck
when Radcliff rode out to West End,' said

2008
01:46:27,851 --> 01:46:28,851
Ruth.

2009
01:46:28,851 --> 01:46:29,851
'It was the perfect opportunity to get rid
of him.'

2010
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:30,851
Becky looked at her.

2011
01:46:30,851 --> 01:46:31,851
'I wonder why he did ride all the way out
there to West End.

2012
01:46:31,851 --> 01:46:32,851
Radcliff, I mean.'

2013
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:33,851
Ruth spoke slowly.

2014
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:34,851
'I guess we'll never know.

2015
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:35,851
Maybe he wanted to see the place where Lizzie
died.

2016
01:46:35,851 --> 01:46:36,851
That was the start of everything that changed
his life so completely - Lizzie's death and

2017
01:46:36,851 --> 01:46:37,851
then his father's.'

2018
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:38,851
She looked at Becky.

2019
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:39,851
'But he shouldn't have come to find me.'

2020
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:40,851
She looked away again.

2021
01:46:40,851 --> 01:46:41,851
And Scanlon didn't need to worry.

2022
01:46:41,851 --> 01:46:42,851
Newman told the police he had seen me on the
beach that day.

2023
01:46:42,851 --> 01:46:43,851
I remember they asked me again and again about
it.

2024
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:44,851
But I was only seven years old.

2025
01:46:44,851 --> 01:46:45,851
I was building a wonderful sandcastle.

2026
01:46:45,851 --> 01:46:46,851
I didn't see anyone.'

2027
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:47,851
Becky left Ruth and walked along the beach
back to the cottage.

2028
01:46:47,851 --> 01:46:48,851
Natalie and Amber were still sitting on the
verandah.

2029
01:46:48,851 --> 01:46:49,851
Becky walked through the gate and stood in
the yard.

2030
01:46:49,851 --> 01:46:50,851
'Did you speak to Ruth?' asked Natalie.

2031
01:46:50,851 --> 01:46:51,851
'Yes,' said Becky.

2032
01:46:51,851 --> 01:46:52,851
'Is she okay?'

2033
01:46:52,851 --> 01:46:53,851
'I don't know.'

2034
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:54,851
Natalie and Amber came to join her.

2035
01:46:54,851 --> 01:46:55,851
Natalie put her arm around Becky's waist.

2036
01:46:55,851 --> 01:46:56,851
'Are you okay?'

2037
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:57,851
she asked.

2038
01:46:57,851 --> 01:46:58,851
'I think so,' said Becky.

2039
01:46:58,851 --> 01:46:59,851
'Well, it's over now,' said Natalie.

2040
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:00,851
'And we've still got a few days before we
have to go home.

2041
01:47:00,851 --> 01:47:01,851
So I say, let's forget about Scanlon and Richard
and Lizzie Keegan and anybody who's got Tavis

2042
01:47:01,851 --> 01:47:02,851
in their name,' she smiled, 'and really enjoy
the last few days of our holiday.

2043
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:03,851
Just the three of us.'

2044
01:47:03,851 --> 01:47:04,851
'Yes,' said Amber, putting her arm around
Becky's shoulder.

2045
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:05,851
'And we won't talk to any boys.'

2046
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:06,851
Becky and Natalie looked at each other and
laughed.

2047
01:47:06,851 --> 01:47:07,851
'Come on, let's go for a swim,' said Natalie.

2048
01:47:07,851 --> 01:47:08,851
And they jumped on their bikes and rode through
the middle of the island - between the shallow

2049
01:47:08,851 --> 01:47:09,851
salt lakes and the tea trees, past the barrel
of the old gun and the lighthouse on the hill

2050
01:47:09,851 --> 01:47:10,851
- until they reached Salmon Bay.

2051
01:47:10,851 --> 01:47:11,851
And they spread their towels on the white
sand and ran into the cool, clear green water.

2052
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:11,853
- THE END -
