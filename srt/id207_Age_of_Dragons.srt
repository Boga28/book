CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:06,240
Brothers in Oath

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,120
It has been a long day and Timucin is very tired, 
but that is unimportant. He looks at the arrow  

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,880
he has just been given and tries to remember if 
he has ever seen anything as beautiful before.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,400
The arrow is far more decorated than all 
the others he has seen. And he has seen  

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:40,640
a lot of arrows. After all, his father is the khan 
- and not just any khan, but the most powerful and  

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:49,200
feared for many days' ride. His yurt is full 
of the most splendid bows and arrows hanging  

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,960
on the walls. Often, other tribes come to visit. 
These tribes have beautiful weaponry too. Not just  

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,280
spears, shields and glinting swords, but artfully 
carved bows and even more exquisite arrows.

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,320
So far, he has never seen an arrow like 
this one. It is longer than his arm,  

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,880
not as long as the arrows the men use, but at 
least two hands longer than the ones he and the  

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:31,120
other boys use to practise - and the carvings are 
so detailed that he is almost afraid to touch it.  

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
The arrowhead is not made of iron, but of bronze.  

14
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:44,320
This makes it weak and practically useless against 
anything with even thick fur, let alone against  

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,360
hardened leather or plate armour. Then again, 
this kind of arrow is not intended to be used  

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,440
like that. The soft metal has been engraved 
with artful lines and symbols, and the edges  

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,840
have been so carefully polished and sharpened 
that it could probably split a hair in half.

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,800
As he looks at it, Timucin is ashamed.

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
"It is... it is beautiful,"  

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,680
he says. "I've never seen anything 
so beautiful. You are a true artist."

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Chuzir pulls a face as if Timucin has just said 
something indecent or spoken badly of the gods.  

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,360
He too holds an arrow in his hand, the one that 
Timucin has given him in return for this stunning  

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,560
work. He is almost convincing as he pretends to 
admire it, even if there is very little to admire.  

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,720
It is a completely normal arrow, short and not 
even entirely straight. Timucin has polished  

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,080
the iron head as much as he can and added 
a few simple carvings with as much skill  

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,280
as his clumsy fingers allow. Chuzir is 
kind enough not to say anything about it.

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,960
"I am no artist," answers Chuzir after a 
noticeable pause and in an almost offended tone  

28
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,720
of voice. "Soon, I shall be a warrior," he adds 
with a sideways glance in Timucin's direction,  

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,600
"although I shall never be a khan, of course." 
He says these last words reproachfully.

30
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
"But this arrow..." says Timucin.

31
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,960
"I did not make it," interrupts Chuzir. "It was 
old man Schezen who did the carving. In return,  

32
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,880
I helped him collect firewood and peat for three 
moons." He looks at Timucin. "Do you not like it?"

33
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,760
"Of course," says Timucin quickly, "it's 
wonderful. But my own arrow is so..." He stops,  

34
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,080
embarrassed, but Chuzir just 
laughs and jabs him in the ribs  

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:23,200
so hard that Timucin will start crying if he does 
not stop himself with all the strength he has.

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,840
"That's not the point," says Chuzir, laughing,  

37
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,480
"because you probably needed just as much 
time to carve it as I spent helping that  

38
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,600
rip-off merchant Schezen carry wood whilst 
he sat by the fire keeping himself warm."

39
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,960
Perhaps that is true, thinks 
Timucin. Nevertheless, he is ashamed  

40
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,360
of the gift. If this were someone else, he 
would suspect them of trying to embarrass him  

41
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:05,120
by making such an exaggerated gift; but not 
Chuzir. Chuzir is his best friend, his only friend  

42
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,680
even - despite the fact that he is the khan's son. 
Or perhaps it is because he is the khan's son...

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,800
"Come on," says Chuzir, jabbing him in the 
ribs again, "let's go and try them out!"

44
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:30,400
Just the very idea of shooting this exquisite 
arrow and perhaps damaging it fills Timucin  

45
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,320
with horror, but Chuzir has already turned on 
his heels and run off, so Timucin follows him.

46
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,480
He runs as fast as he can, but he just cannot 
keep up with Chuzir and will probably lose him.  

47
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,400
Chuzir sees that his best friend is having 
trouble and slows down, then stops entirely.  

48
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,680
Nevertheless, Timucin is completely out of 
breath when he too gets to the top of the hill.  

49
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Chuzir does not say anything, but he 
cannot stop himself from grinning.  

50
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,680
Not that he tries for one moment, either.

51
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:18,240
"I bet I get to the trees before you!" Chuzir 
says. He is not even breathing heavily, while  

52
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,080
Timucin's lungs are burning like fire and his 
heart is beating so hard he thinks it might burst.

53
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,160
"What a cheek!" thinks Timucin to 
himself, and then he turns to Chuzir.

54
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,680
"Why don't you just tell me what I have to 
do for you?" he asks grumpily. "After all,  

55
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,360
I shall have to do it anyway when I lose the 
bet. So I might just as well save my strength."

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
Chuzir grins and makes as if 
to jab him in the ribs again,  

57
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,440
but he just runs around and starts strolling 
towards the woods. Timucin follows, cursing  

58
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,640
himself for what he has just said. Of course, 
Chuzir will never tell anyone anything about it.  

59
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,600
Timucin is his friend, after all, and they are 
about to become brothers in oath. Yet if one of  

60
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,480
the other boys has heard what he has said, then 
it will just lead to more rumours in the village.  

61
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,840
And his father will not like that at all! He 
will have to be more careful about what he says.

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,560
The two young warriors reach 
the trees at the same time.  

63
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,560
Chuzir takes his bow from his shoulder, loads it 
with Timucin's arrow and, inspecting it closely,  

64
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,240
draws it halfway back. There he holds it, 
waiting until Timucin too has cocked his bow.  

65
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,880
He nods the signal to shoot and then draws back 
his bow in a movement as smooth as it is strong.

66
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
"Forever," he says.

67
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
"Forever," echoes Timucin.

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,680
Their arrows fly off with a twin crack. 
Despite being too short, bent and warped,  

69
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,000
Timucin's arrow, sped by Chuzir's bowstring, flies 
almost twice as far as the richly decorated work  

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,080
of art that he himself has shot off. It must have 
flown at least two hundred paces, perhaps even  

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,000
three hundred, before burrowing into the ground 
halfway between the trees and the riverbank.

72
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,840
"Forever", says Chuzir once again; and 
this time, too, Timucin echoes him.

73
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:56,320
Chuzir is beaming. A warm feeling comes 
over Timucin, accompanied nevertheless  

74
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,240
by a strange feeling of emptiness, 
almost of disappointment.  

75
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,680
So now they are brothers in oath. They have 
been talking about it since last summer  

76
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,080
and have made preparations accordingly, 
and somehow, he expected it to be... well,  

77
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,280
more dramatic. Taking an oath together 
is more than being brothers by birth;  

78
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,280
it means being bound together forever, being two 
parts of a whole who just happen to live in two  

79
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,160
different bodies. From this day forth, he will be 
willing to give his life to protect his brother  

80
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:49,040
if need be, and he expects this thought to be 
somehow... elevating. Shouldn't the earthquake  

81
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,680
and the heavens open? Shouldn't there at least 
be a thunderclap and a few flashes of lightning?

82
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,280
Yet there is nothing, of course.  

83
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,240
Chuzir embraces him briefly and then turns 
away brusquely. "Let's go and get the arrows."

84
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,080
They do not run this time, but Chuzir has 
almost twice as much ground to cover as Timucin  

85
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,840
to reach his arrow and, for some reason, 
Timucin does not want to follow him.

86
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,920
He pulls the precious arrow from the 
ground and wipes it down carefully.  

87
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,160
Suddenly he has an intense feeling  

88
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,680
of being watched. Perhaps the other young 
warriors had found out what they were doing?

89
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,880
Timucin turns round and stiffens.  

90
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,280
His hunch is true. Except that he is not 
just being watched, he is being stalked.

91
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,800
It's a dog, almost as big 
as a foal, but far heavier.  

92
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,080
It is a shaggy-coated monstrosity with 
huge teeth, dripping with yellow slaver.  

93
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:19,200
And it is standing about ten paces behind him 
at the edge of the forest, staring at him.

94
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,400
Timucin can feel his heart faltering. He hates 
dogs and is afraid of them more than anything  

95
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:35,520
else in the world. He grips the arrow tighter, 
but, although his life might now depend on it,  

96
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:43,120
something seems to be stopping him from 
drawing the bowstring. The dog might kill  

97
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,240
him. Perhaps it does not want to, but it can 
- and this thought is more than he can bear.

98
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,720
"Timucin, shoot!" cries Chuzir at almost the 
same moment as he releases his bowstring.  

99
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,640
The arrow whizzes past Timucin's cheek,  

100
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,800
stroking him with its feathers. As the arrow 
hits the ground just over a man's length away  

101
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,680
from the dog, it lets out a frightened yelp 
and runs off with its tail between its legs.

102
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:26,800
"Timucin, shoot!" shouts Chuzir again, "What are 
you waiting for?" Timucin hears Chuzir's steps  

103
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,000
and sees the huge dog bolting like a hare towards 
the trees and disappearing into the undergrowth.  

104
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,080
Chuzir reaches him, tears the arrow from 
his fingers and, faster than Timucin's eyes  

105
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,160
can follow, loads it into his bow. He draws 
the string back behind his ear and then...  

106
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,880
He lets out a moan as he drops 
the bow. The dog is gone.

107
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,160
"Why did you do that?" he asks 
angrily. "Why didn't you shoot?"

108
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:13,840
"Because, er, because the arrow..." stutters 
Timucin. Chuzir looks at him with a frown  

109
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,080
and Timucin continues to 
speak, with a nervous smile.

110
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,360
"I was afraid of breaking 
it, as it is so valuable..."

111
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,240
This only makes Chuzir angrier, 
but he says nothing more,  

112
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,240
pressing his lips together out of rage and 
stomping off past him to fetch his dart.

113
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,440
Timucin knows what will happen in the night.  

114
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,840
The dragon will come to him and 
show him what he has missed.
 
 
 

115
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,440
CHAPTER TWO

116
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
The Dream Dragon

117
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,720
Timucin goes to bed unusually early this evening.  

118
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,960
Most evenings, his mother has to tell him to go 
and leave the men to sit round the fire in peace,  

119
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:15,680
as is their right. All too often, he stays up 
until his father puts his foot down. Only then  

120
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,200
does he do as he is told and goes into his little 
yurt, pitched right next to his father's tent.  

121
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,360
He has been sleeping alone here since 
last summer. Today, however, he cannot  

122
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,320
wait to go. He gulps down his dinner, makes 
an excuse and goes to bed before sunset.

123
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:47,440
As is always the case when trying to sleep, it 
takes a long time for him to sink into slumber.  

124
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:56,320
He has barely fallen asleep when Sarantuya 
comes to him. Just like every time,  

125
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,480
Timucin feels her presence more than he sees 
it. Well, in the first moments in any case.  

126
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:12,160
It is something big, infinitely 
soft but also infinitely old  

127
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,360
and strong that steals into his dreams 
and only slowly takes on a form.

128
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,280
"I haven't seen you for a while," he says.

129
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,240
"I didn't feel that you needed me," answers 
Sarantuya. The shadowy figure in his dream  

130
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,320
starts to become clearer. At the edge 
of his consciousness, something big,  

131
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:51,360
something ancient stirs, glinting like 
moonlight on silver scales. It touches his soul.  

132
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,920
He feels warmth and comfort and thinks 
he almost sees something. Almost.

133
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,080
"Why did you do that?" asks Timucin.

134
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,720
Sarantuya squints, as the moonlight in the 
dream breaks on her scales and then flows down  

135
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:25,040
her flanks, jingling lightly as if, somewhere 
far away, a thousand cymbals are being struck.  

136
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,000
It is always night in Timucin's dreams when 
Sarantuya comes to him, and there is always  

137
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,320
a full moon. He has stopped being surprised 
by it. "What did you say?" she asks him.

138
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,000
Timucin has to force himself not to 
get angry; despite her huge claws  

139
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,720
and sharp fangs, Sarantuya hates 
strong feelings like anger and fury.  

140
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,840
She is the most peaceful creature 
Timucin has ever come across.

141
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,280
"You know very well what I mean," he says, 
just managing to keep control of himself.  

142
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:22,080
"That dog! Why did you stop Chuzir killing it?" 
"Did I?" replies Sarantuya, pretending to be  

143
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:32,880
surprised. Then she laughs quietly. It sounds like 
thunder rolling in the mountains on the horizon.

144
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,760
"What if your friend Chuzir just missed?"

145
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,840
"Nonsense!" replies Timucin. "Chuzir is the 
best shot I know. He never misses his target!"

146
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,800
"Not even with a bent arrow?" 
says Sarantuya mockingly.

147
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
Timucin ignores this comment.

148
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,240
"He never misses his target," he insists.

149
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,960
"Well then, it must be that somebody wanted 
him to miss," says Sarantuya, smirking.

150
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,720
"You."

151
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,880
"No," says the dragon, suddenly in a very 
serious tone of voice. "I would never do  

152
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
anything you do not want, and you know it."

153
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,160
Timucin says nothing more. Chuzir 
said nothing after missing. He simply  

154
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,520
walked on for a few moments, offended. The way 
he looked at Timucin showed that he knew exactly  

155
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:46,320
who he blamed for his unusual failure. Perhaps 
Chuzir actually knows that it is Timucin's fault.  

156
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,680
Timucin has already told him 
once about his dream dragon,  

157
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,320
but Chuzir's reaction was such that Timucin 
has never mentioned it again. It was years  

158
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,720
ago now, and Timucin does not know if Chuzir 
remembers it at all, but you just never know.

159
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,480
"You didn't really want to kill the 
dog," continues Sarantuya after a while.

160
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,640
"But I was afraid of him", answers Timucin.

161
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,680
"I know," says Sarantuya with a sigh, "but you 
don't need to kill every-thing you are afraid of.  

162
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,960
Do you remember the first time you saw me?"

163
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,880
"Of course I do!"

164
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
"You were afraid of me, too."

165
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,720
"No, I wasn't," claims Timucin, 
although this is a downright lie.  

166
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,960
He almost died of fright the first time 
the dragon appeared to him in a dream.

167
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,080
"So," continues Sarantuya, "did you 
want to kill me because of that?"

168
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,760
"Of course not!" answers Timucin, 
outraged. "I would never..."

169
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,600
"... kill anything that hasn't done you any harm," 
says Sarantuya, finishing his sentence for him.  

170
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,640
"I know. If it were any different, 
I would never have come to you."

171
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Timucin does not really 
understand what she is saying, but  

172
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,840
he isn't in the mood to ask questions. Sarantuya 
says many odd things that he does not understand.

173
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,960
"What do you want?" he asks reluctantly.

174
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,840
For once, Timucin's anger seems to 
amuse Sarantuya, perhaps because  

175
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,360
she too feels that, in reality, it 
is only directed against himself.

176
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,320
"Really, it should be me asking 
you these questions," she answers.  

177
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:05,680
"If I remember correctly, you were the one 
who called me, and not the other way round.  

178
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:16,880
Since I'm here anyway... Tomorrow is a 
big day for you. A very important day."

179
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,440
Timucin thinks as hard as 
he can. Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

180
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,480
"How so?" he asks, skeptically.

181
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,800
"It's a surprise!" says Sarantuya, 
teasing him. "You will meet someone.  

182
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,840
Someone who will become very important to you."

183
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,200
"Who?" asks Timucin.

184
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,840
Yet Sarantuya does not even answer. She 
disappears with a silvery, bright laugh.
 
 
 

185
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,160
CHAPTER THREE

186
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,880
The Warrior

187
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,720
His father Tamer wakes him the following 
morning before the sun has come up.  

188
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,200
This is nothing unusual: most people in the 
village get up before dawn, and only very rarely  

189
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:27,280
does Timucin sleep past sunrise. If he does, 
it is mostly when his father has been up too  

190
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,760
long drinking or discussing matters with the 
other men - both of which have the same result.  

191
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,080
What is unusual, however, is his father's 
grumpy mood and his even grumpier face.  

192
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:53,200
This is the first thing Timucin sees as he opens 
his eyes. Tamer is a great warrior, no doubt,  

193
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,240
who has killed many enemies and brought the 
tribe to respect and riches. But at the bottom  

194
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,840
of his heart, he is a friendly man, a gentle 
one, especially where his son is concerned.

195
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,640
This morning, however, he is not 
at all gentle. In fact, he seems  

196
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,720
furious as he grasps his son's shoulder 
and shakes him roughly to wake him.  

197
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,520
If Timucin were not as sleepy, he would 
understand that his father really is furious.

198
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
He rubs his eyes and looks astonished  

199
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,080
as his father goes back to the small entrance 
to the tent and motions him to follow.

200
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,640
Just like every morning, they look after 
the horses and drive the sheep onto the  

201
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:56,240
pasture without saying a single word to one 
another. Then they go down to the river to  

202
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,960
wash themselves in the icy waters of the Omon. 
Then his father breaks the uncomfortable silence.

203
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,440
"Chuzir told me about the dog," he 
says, his voice full of reproach.  

204
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,720
Timucin looks at him. He is not quite 
sure what Chuzir has told his father,  

205
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:31,840
and so saying nothing is probably the 
cleverest thing to do. His father sighs deeply.

206
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:44,080
"When are you going to finally become a man, my 
son?" he asks. "You are my only son, Timucin,  

207
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,360
and one day you will take my place and become 
khan. But how will you be able to do that if  

208
00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:00,880
you are still a mere boy?" Timucin does not 
answer. His father does not want an answer,  

209
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:08,880
he can feel this, and this is not the first time 
they have had this talk. Tamer may not yet have  

210
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:17,680
said it as directly as he has now, but Timucin 
knows very well that it is a great source of pain  

211
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,640
to him that his only son will not grow 
into the great warrior he wants him to be.  

212
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,920
Timucin may be a passable bowman, may be good 
rider, and may just about know how to handle  

213
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:44,400
a sword and shield, but that is not enough. 
The other boys are better than he is, even  

214
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:52,320
the younger ones. It is not so much a question 
of his ability, his skill or even his courage.  

215
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,480
It is just that he doesn't like weapons. 
He has never really understood where the  

216
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,200
glow in the eyes of the warriors comes from when 
they speak of all the enemies they have slain.

217
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:16,000
"Chuzir told me," says his father, picking 
up where he left off, "that you were scared  

218
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,840
stiff of the dog as it stood in front of you."

219
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,600
"It was a very big dog..." answers 
Timucin, "and it was very dangerous."

220
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,720
This must have been the wrong answer, 
because Tamer's face becomes even darker.

221
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,080
"Did it attack you?" he asks.

222
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:48,160
Timucin keeps silent. His father 
turns suddenly and walks back  

223
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,640
towards the village with such big strides 
that Timucin has to struggle not to fall back.  

224
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,360
His father does not look at 
him as he starts talking again.

225
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,000
"Dogs, Timucin, are, after horses, our most 
loyal friends. They help us to watch our sheep,  

226
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,080
to keep our food supplies free of 
rats, and they warm us in winter  

227
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,200
when the fire no longer burns enough. 
There is no need to be afraid of them!"

228
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:26,400
"But it was growling at me!" says Timucin in his 
defence. He is not sure if this was actually the  

229
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,840
case, and it is clearly not the answer that 
Tamer wants, because now he is really furious.

230
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,600
"But it didn't attack you, did it? And 
even if it had, you would have had to have  

231
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,440
killed it like a warrior. You had 
your bow with you, didn't you?"

232
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,000
"Yes," answers Timucin 
dejectedly, "I am sorry, father."

233
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,920
"Be silent!" shouts Tamer. 
"You are the son of a khan!  

234
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,920
You shall never say you are sorry to anyone about 
anything! Not even to me! If you make a mistake,  

235
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,760
be sure not to do it again. But never apologise!"

236
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,960
"Yes father," replies Timucin. 
He almost adds "I am sorry".

237
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
They cover the rest of the way 
back to the village in silence.  

238
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,480
As they reach it over the hill, the 
village is now wide-awake and busy at work.  

239
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:41,680
They hear children shouting, an ox mooing and, in 
the distance, the thunder of horses' hooves. When  

240
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,800
they get to Tamer's yurt, which, as is his right, 
is the biggest in the village, big enough to take  

241
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:59,200
in all the men in the entire tribe, they find it 
empty. This is unusual, and Timucin wants to leave  

242
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:07,360
the tent and go about his daily work, which he has 
now neglected too long. But Tamer calls him back  

243
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,920
with a lordly movement of his hand and gestures 
to him to stand in the middle of the tent.

244
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:24,720
Timucin is confused, but obeys his father. His 
heart is beating hard. He has been hoping that  

245
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,960
this is all over, but it seems that his father 
has not finished yet. Perhaps what Tamer has just  

246
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,280
said is only the beginning? His 
heart starts to beat even faster,  

247
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,520
and he clenches his fists so that his father 
does not see how badly his fingers are shaking.

248
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,240
Tamer is moving around behind him, and Timucin 
asks himself what he is actually doing.  

249
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,040
He does not dare to turn around, but 
keeps staring at the ashes of the fire.  

250
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,840
Finally, his father returns and throws 
something to the ground in front of him.  

251
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,520
It takes Timucin a while to recognise it as 
the full outfit and weaponry of a warrior.  

252
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:26,880
There is a leather tunic and belt, a fine-woven 
chainmail shirt, boots with artfully engraved  

253
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:37,120
metal plates, a breastplate and shield, a precious 
bronze helmet and a broad, decorated weapon-belt,  

254
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:45,680
wrapped around a beautifully forged sword. 
There is everything he needs to be a warrior.

255
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,817
"Put it on!" says Tamer.

256
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:55,120
Timucin obeys his father, but he 
is becoming more and more nervous.  

257
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
He knows of the existence of warriors' 
clothing because Tamer has told him  

258
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:10,960
about it. His father always stresses that it is 
reserved for very special occasions, and Timucin  

259
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,120
has never seen it before. He does not dare ask 
questions but looks quizzically at his father  

260
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,360
while putting on the outfit. Finally, 
Tamer breaks the silence himself.

261
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,560
"Today is a special day," he 
begins and watches closely  

262
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,520
every movement Timucin's nervous hands make, 
"and I want you to make a good impression.  

263
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Behave yourself and do not bring shame upon our 
clan or upon me, your father. And do not worry:  

264
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,840
I have told our warriors to chase all the dogs 
out of the village until our visitor has left."

265
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,200
Timucin feels his ears going 
red and sinks his head in shame.

266
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,080
"Who is coming to visit?" he asks nonetheless.

267
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:19,440
"My brother in oath, Belmin, the khan 
of the Voshon tribe," answers Tamer.  

268
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,400
"Have you heard of them?"

269
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,240
"Yes father," answers Timucin quietly. The Voshon?  

270
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:35,200
Of course, he has heard of them, as well as of 
Belmin, their wise and mighty khan. Belmin became  

271
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,392
his father's brother in oath when he and Tamer 
were the same age as Timucin and Chuzir are now.

272
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:52,799
The Voshon tribe has far more land than Tamer's 
tribe and is much, much richer. It is told that  

273
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,840
their herds are so big that, if all their horses 
were to be driven together at once, they would  

274
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:10,000
cover the steppe from horizon to horizon. The 
khan's yurt is said to be covered in pure gold.

275
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,880
Despite this wealth and power, it is told that 
they are a very peaceful tribe, and many warriors  

276
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,920
laugh at them - as long as Tamer is not around 
to defend the honour of his brother in oath.

277
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,160
Timucin buckles his sword-belt and then reaches 
for the last item, his helmet. He thinks for a  

278
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:42,160
moment about whether to put it on now, but then 
decides against this and puts it under his left  

279
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:50,400
arm. His father eyes him for a moment, looks 
him up and down and then nods his approval.

280
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,640
"And what is so important about this visit 
for me?" asks Timucin. "Who am I meeting?"

281
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:07,680
Tamer looks at him surprised, and Timucin wants 
to slap himself in the face for having asked this  

282
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:14,160
question. It is Sarantuya who has told him that 
he will meet somebody who will affect his future,  

283
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:22,560
not his father. He has said nothing. He looks 
at Timucin for two or three heartbeats in a way  

284
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:32,160
that makes Timucin really very uncomfortable. 
Then, however, he answers his son's question:  

285
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:41,680
"You are old enough now, my son, and soon you 
will be a man. It is time to find you a wife."

286
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:54,800
"A wife?" Timucin is beyond surprised. He was 
ready for anything, just not that. "But..."

287
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:04,960
"You are old enough, my boy," interrupts Tamer, 
"at your age, I was already married. Belmin is  

288
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:13,200
bringing his daughter, Arbesa. She is just one 
year younger than you and, so I have heard tell,  

289
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,600
very beautiful. And of course a link between 
our tribes would be to everyone's advantage."

290
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,240
"But I don't know this girl 
at all," protests Timucin.

291
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,880
As he has expected, his father's 
face darkens. Moments later, however,  

292
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:48,240
a sudden and unusually gentle smile spreads across 
his face. "Son, I would never force you to marry  

293
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,840
anyone you do not want to, but have a look 
at her at least. I ask for no more than that,  

294
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,480
and perhaps you will like her. She will 
definitely like you, I'm very sure of that."

295
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,000
Timucin looks quizzically as Tamer stops talking  

296
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,200
and bends down to pick up a polished silver 
plate left from the previous evening's feast.  

297
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,440
There are streaks of dried sheep's milk and 
bits of food stuck to it, but Timucin can still  

298
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,800
see his own reflection in the mirror and 
understands what his father means. He really does  

299
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,160
look like a warrior, magnificently equipped 
and wild, with his hair braided his strong  

300
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:48,000
features and his lively, light blue eyes. Who 
would be able to resist him looking like this?

301
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:57,840
Timucin is about to make a jokey remark about 
this when he thinks he feels movement behind him.  

302
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:09,040
It is a kind of golden shimmering, like 
moonlight breaking on polished scales.  

303
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:19,280
He quickly checks behind himself, but sees 
nothing. When he looks back at the plate, however,  

304
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:28,800
he sees Sarantuya reflected behind him, this 
time even more clearly than in his dream.  

305
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,960
She looks at him and she too  

306
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,240
sees the warrior, which this wonderful 
armour, sword and helmet have made him into.

307
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,840
The big gold dragon looks sad.
 
 
 

308
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,640
CHAPTER FOUR

309
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,760
New Arrival

310
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:02,320
Belmin does not come until the sun is well 
past its highest point. Nevertheless, as befits  

311
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,240
someone of his rank, he travels with a large 
entourage. Several riders have arrived before him  

312
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:18,640
to give advance notice of his arrival. The whole 
village gathers to welcome him fittingly. Timucin  

313
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,360
of course has a place in the first row, right 
next to his father and the other warriors.

314
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,160
However, Timucin does not start towards 
the group until the baggage train can be  

315
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,400
seen on the hills in the West. He is 
not in much of a hurry to get there,  

316
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,880
and in even less of a hurry to meet 
either his father's brother in oath,  

317
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:53,920
or his daughter. He has got nothing against 
girls and knows as well as the next man that  

318
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,160
the children of tribal chiefs get married to 
each other in order to increase their power  

319
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:09,440
and to secure an often all too insecure peace. 
He should not be surprised that his turn has now  

320
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,120
come. He has simply believed that he has a little 
more time - perhaps another summer, maybe two.

321
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,440
Of course, he will not dare to defy his 
father. But he has mixed feelings about  

322
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,880
this meeting with his father's brother 
in oath and, above all, the daughter.

323
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,440
As befits their status, the other boys, 
including Chuzir, wait at an appropriate distance  

324
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:48,480
behind the warriors and the elders, yet in front 
of the women still. Timucin has to walk past them  

325
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:57,200
in order to join his father on time. He ignores 
the other boys as usual, but greets Chuzir and  

326
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:06,880
is about to set off even faster. Yet he notices 
Chuzir's dark expression of face and turns round  

327
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:14,960
to him, his brow furrowed quizzically. 
Chuzir avoids his gaze and turns away.

328
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,560
"What is wrong?" asks Timucin 
bluntly. He is confused.

329
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:31,840
"Nothing," replies Chuzir curtly. Timucin 
stretches his hand out so as to seize him  

330
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,840
by the shoulder, but Chuzir steps back 
quickly and Timucin pulls back his arm.  

331
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:48,400
He feels a faint but deep stabbing pain in 
his chest: Chuzir is his brother in oath!

332
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,520
"You must hurry, Timucin," 
says one of the other boys,  

333
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,720
"otherwise you, our future Khan, will 
arrive too late to greet your bride."

334
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,880
Timucin flashes his eyes at the boy, 
but does not say anything. Ilhan,  

335
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:16,720
the boy, is two heads taller than him and doesn't 
like him. Timucin dislikes him too, and feels that  

336
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:25,360
he will have to fight him one day. Yet he does not 
want it to be now, so he offers Ilhan nothing more  

337
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:34,480
than a contemptuous look and makes to go on. 
Ilhan, however, continues in a mocking tone.

338
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,080
"Don't you worry! We will make sure that  

339
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,000
nothing else gets in the way of our 
future khan and his bride. Woof woof!"

340
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,600
This comment was followed 
by laughter from all around,  

341
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,760
and Timucin feels a sudden fury, so strong that 
he wants to jump at the bigger boy and pummel him.

342
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:07,760
Yet his fury dies away as quickly as it comes, and 
gives way to something very different and much,  

343
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:17,360
much worse. His eyes fill with burning 
tears, and he turns back to Chuzir.  

344
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,440
He steps so close to him that 
no one else can hear him speak.

345
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,840
"Why did you tell them about it?" 
he whispers. His voice is shaking.

346
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:39,440
Chuzir avoids his gaze again. Timucin 
waits for him to answer the question,  

347
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:48,560
but he says nothing, so Timucin turns away angry 
and walks away as quickly as he can without  

348
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:57,600
running. Behind him, the boys are laughing and 
a few of them bark again. Timucin keeps his back  

349
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:04,720
turned to them, but it costs him all the 
strength he has to hold back the tears.

350
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,240
His father seems very angry when he arrives 
next to him, but he does not have the time  

351
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,680
to say anything to him because, in that 
moment, the baggage train is coming by.  

352
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,840
Tamer simply looks at his son angrily in a 
way that seems to promise punishment later.  

353
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,360
Then he straightens his shoulders 
and gets ready to greet his guests.

354
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:42,080
Belmin is an older, white-haired man with a 
white beard that reaches his chest. He has a  

355
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:50,640
weather-beaten face and exudes an aura of dignity 
and power that you can almost reach out and grasp.  

356
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:00,400
Timucin has often met men who have great 
power (including his father, of course), but  

357
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:09,280
Belmin differs from them in one important point: 
he is the first chief he has ever met who does  

358
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:19,760
not carry a weapon. His large entourage, too, 
is mostly unarmed. Just the two knight's right  

359
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:27,520
and left of him have spears held upright in their 
hands, and it looks to Timucin somehow as if they  

360
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,840
only have them to tie their pennants to, which 
are fluttering above their heads in the wind.

361
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:43,120
Tamer greets his noble guest effusively, using 
the complicated and wordy greetings common to his  

362
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:51,600
people. Timucin uses this time to have a closer 
look at the many people accompanying the khan of  

363
00:44:51,600 --> 00:45:00,000
the Voshon. Of course, there is a very particular 
person he is looking for, and he finds her a  

364
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,400
little behind Belmin, flanked by two knights who, 
contrary to his first impressions, are heavily  

365
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:19,040
armed. She is slender, wrapped up in exquisite 
garments, and about a hand shorter than him.  

366
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:32,160
She has to be Arbesa, his future wife. Her 
face is veiled, so he cannot quite recognise  

367
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,040
its features, but he thinks he sees her keen 
stare through the material and quickly looks away.

368
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:47,920
The greeting ceremony goes on for quite some time, 
but eventually it is over and Belmin makes a brief  

369
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:57,040
gesture, allowing his entourage to sit. Milk 
as well as other, stronger drinks are offered,  

370
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,200
along with a meal, and suddenly the ceremonial 
silence, previously broken only by the exchange of  

371
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,160
formalities between the khans, gives way to 
general laughter and pats on the shoulder  

372
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,440
as the more than thirty riders start to 
mix with the population of the village.  

373
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:26,000
Arbesa, too, slips down from her horse 
with a smooth movement, yet Timucin  

374
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,120
does not find the right moment to 
approach her or even to look at her.  

375
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:42,160
Tamer puts his hand on his shoulder and 
pushes him in between himself and Belmin.

376
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,760
"This my son, Timucin," he says.

377
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:54,560
The old khan looks at him with his strangely 
soft eyes for a few instants. Despite  

378
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:02,400
the tangible aura of softness and goodness 
he exudes, Timucin - who is already very  

379
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:10,640
uncomfortable - is almost afraid of 
him. Then the khan smiles suddenly.

380
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:19,760
"So you are Timucin," he says, 
"I have heard a lot about you.  

381
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:28,800
I am told that you are a son who is every bit 
as honorable as his father. Is this true?"

382
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,440
Timucin does not know what to answer 
and simply lowers his head in shame.  

383
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:43,440
In this situation, this is almost 
an insult. Tamer is horrified  

384
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:52,800
and sucks in air sharply past his teeth. Belmin, 
however, just laughs, quietly and benevolently.

385
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:03,520
"Well, I see he really is his father's son. My 
brother in oath was never one for too many words."

386
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:13,680
Tamer laughs, but even his laugh sounds hollow, 
and he puts another hand on Timucin's shoulder.  

387
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,280
It is as if he is showing Timucin 
off as his own property, and Timucin  

388
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:29,120
finds this degrading. He does not say anything, 
however, and keeps looking for Arbesa.  

389
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,040
The girl has already gone past him, without 
even looking at him, as it seems to him,  

390
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:44,080
and is now talking with the women. The men of the 
tribe, too, have mingled with the village people,  

391
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:51,920
and are eating, joking and drinking with them. 
The big reception has dissolved into nothing.  

392
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:00,480
Only his father and his father's brother in oath 
are still standing, trying to look important,  

393
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,160
but they are clearly not succeeding.  

394
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,240
Tamer clearly finds the situation 
embarrassing; Belmin looks amused by it all.  

395
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:19,520
Finally, he clears his throat and gestures 
towards the big yurt in the middle of the village.

396
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,840
"It was a long and tiring journey, old friend,  

397
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,600
and I am thirsty. We have not seen each other 
for many years and have much to talk about."

398
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,720
And talk they did.
 
 
 

399
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,600
CHAPTER FIVE

400
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,320
Arbesa

401
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:50,880
Having gone to bed so early the evening before, 
Timucin ends up going to bed very late tonight. A  

402
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:58,880
huge feast is being given in honour of the guests, 
starting just before sundown and going on until  

403
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:08,400
far past midnight. Almost all of the clansmen are 
in Tamer's tent, eating, talking and drinking.  

404
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:17,840
The women are barely able to keep up with serving 
food and drinks. With all the delicious food,  

405
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:25,280
and with the hours that pass, the feasting becomes 
ever more boisterous, and the men's tongues become  

406
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:33,920
looser. The camp echoes to the sounds of laughter 
and music and the happy voices of the men as they  

407
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,200
try to outdo each other with amazing stories. 
Everyone knows that only half of the stories  

408
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:48,240
are actually true, but that does not stop them 
being listened to intently and greatly enjoyed.

409
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,840
Timucin spends the feast sitting 
at his father's right-hand side,  

410
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,880
listening to the stories that the clansmen are 
so happily embellishing, but he cannot fully  

411
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,680
concentrate on the proceedings. His gaze 
keeps wandering over to the veiled girl  

412
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:15,440
next to Belmin, and when he is not looking at 
her, he thinks he can feel her eyes on him.

413
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:25,200
At the beginning, it is an unpleasant feeling. He 
does not like being stared at without being able  

414
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:33,200
to see the face of the person staring. After 
a while, however, it just feels slightly odd.  

415
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,720
He is curious to have a look behind 
the veil. But apart from the fact that  

416
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:46,080
this is not the done thing, he doesn't 
allow himself to make such a request.

417
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,000
It is long past midnight 
when, from outside the yurt,  

418
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,600
they hear the typical sound of swords clashing.  

419
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:03,280
Tamer stops talking to his brother in oath without 
finishing his sentence and then jumps up and  

420
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,760
hurries out of the tent. Everyone else, including 
Belmin and of course Timucin, follow suit.

421
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,320
Outside the tent, a fight is going on between one 
of Arbesa's bodyguards and a man from the village;  

422
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:27,120
at least, that is the way it seems at first. 
Swords clash and spray sparks, light breaks on  

423
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:35,360
shimmering metal and the links in chainmail vests. 
The two men seem to be carrying out a bizarre and  

424
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:42,080
speedy dance around each other, exercising 
themselves in sword-fighting techniques like  

425
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:51,280
parries and feints whilst the blades smash into 
their shields. No blood has yet been spilled,  

426
00:52:51,280 --> 00:53:00,080
as Timucin quickly recognizes, and none will 
be: the two men are laughing as they fight.  

427
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:07,200
Arbesa's bodyguard could land a hit on the leg 
of the man fighting him, but turns the blade  

428
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:13,840
at the last moment so that it hits him 
flat. This hurts, but is not dangerous.  

429
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:23,200
The onlookers whoop and clap whilst Ilhan's father 
- as Timucin recognizes him, uncomfortably - hops  

430
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,520
around on one leg swearing, and then lunges 
at his opponent all the more bitterly.

431
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,680
Timucin too suddenly hears himself 
cheering on the two fighters  

432
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,480
as he hears a high-pitched voice next to him.

433
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,760
"What do you men find so 
exciting about playing war?"

434
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,240
"Well, because it's just..." says Timucin.  

435
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,840
Then he stops himself in mid flow and 
turns round to see who has said this.

436
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,880
It is Arbesa. She has removed her veil  

437
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,400
and is looking down at the two fighters 
with an expression somewhere between  

438
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:14,880
quizzical and derogatory. She has the most 
beautiful face that Timucin has ever seen.

439
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,120
"Yes...?" she asks, turning round to him.  

440
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:30,320
Timucin looks into her crys-tal-clear, almost 
uncannily light eyes. These eyes awaken something  

441
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:39,920
in him whose existence he has not known until that 
moment. It is as if his throat has been tied up.

442
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,360
"Well, because it's... er..." he stutters.

443
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,560
Arbesa's eyes flash in a way that 
can only be described as scoffing.

444
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,240
"I understand. 'Because men 
just do that kind of thing',  

445
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,160
right?" She laughs. "We all 
know that. The question is why?"

446
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,760
"In order to measure their strength and be 
ready when they come up against the enemy,"  

447
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:20,400
answers Timucin automatically. He feels stupid, 
and Arbesa probably thinks he is stupid too,  

448
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,920
because the scorn in her eyes continues to grow.

449
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,280
"The enemy?" she repeats. "Which enemy?"

450
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,840
Before Timucin has the chance 
to answer, she does it herself.

451
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:42,080
"It doesn't matter much. There's always an enemy 
around, isn't there?" Her eyes look at Timucin  

452
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:49,040
as intently as if she were looking at him for 
the very first time. Something in her gaze  

453
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,000
stabs at Timucin's heart like a thin needle.

454
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:03,200
"You too look like a real warrior, but perhaps 
a little small," she says and covers her face  

455
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,920
back up with her veil, turns around abruptly 
and walks back to the yurt with quick steps.

456
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:18,320
Timucin looks confused and hears a cheerful 
peal of laughter behind him. A hand  

457
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:26,560
comes down on his shoulder and, as he looks up, 
he is looking directly into Belmin's bearded face.  

458
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,680
The old khan smiles, almost mischievously.

459
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:40,320
"Yes, well, you've met my daughter now, 
then," he says. "Do you still like her?"

460
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:50,080
Timucin says nothing - what can he say? - 
and just looks up at Belmin, taken aback.  

461
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:59,040
He takes his hand off of Timucin's shoulder and 
motions with his head for Timucin to follow him.

462
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,400
"Come, let us step together."

463
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Timucin looks helplessly at the two fighters; they 
have not come anywhere near finishing, and yet  

464
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:17,840
it is a question of the honour of the tribe. That 
does not seem to bother the old khan, however, who  

465
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:26,800
walks off slowly, away from the light and shouts 
and noise of the friendly tussle. Timucin is  

466
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:35,040
not sure how long it will stay friendly. He knows 
Ilhan's father well, and he does not like losing.

467
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:44,320
"Please do not be upset at Arbesa," says Belmin 
once they have walked a while. "She is still  

468
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:51,680
young and speaks freely and from the heart. She 
will soon learn to consider her words better."

469
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:01,760
"I am not upset at her," says Timucin hurriedly, 
"she is a girl, after all." "And very pretty one,  

470
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:11,440
eh?" adds the father. Timucin feels himself going 
red. He does not know why, but he lowers his head  

471
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,240
and hopes that Belmin does not notice.

472
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,080
"She is still a child," continues the 
old khan in an amused tone of voice,  

473
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,800
from which Timucin understands 
that he has noticed his blush,  

474
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,520
"but we can see that she will soon be a 
good-looking young woman. If she takes after  

475
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:41,520
her mother, she will be a real beauty. By the 
same token, she will be fiercely independent."  

476
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:52,240
He laughs. "You can think yourself lucky to get a 
woman of her calibre. If you want her." He stands  

477
00:58:52,240 --> 00:59:01,840
still and examines Timucin with a changed, but 
still not unfriendly gaze. "So, do you want her?"

478
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,160
"But of course!" answers 
Timucin hastily. "My father..."

479
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:15,120
"... has told you how important this 
alliance is for our two tribes, and how I  

480
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:23,040
am his oldest and best friend and his brother in 
oath. The important thing, however, is what you  

481
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,560
and Arbesa want. Do you want this to happen?"

482
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,560
Timucin does not answer 
straight away and, when he does,  

483
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,600
he answers so openly that he surprises himself.

484
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,480
"I do not know, my lord. I mean, I do not 
know her yet. She is very pretty, but..."

485
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:58,320
"I understand," sighs Belmin. He does not seem 
upset at all. In fact, he almost sounds relieved,  

486
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:06,960
even if Timucin does not quite understand why. 
"Then again, this is the reason we are here."  

487
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,760
He gestures towards the tent to which his daughter 
has walked back. "Arbesa is waiting for you in  

488
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:25,200
your tent. Go to her and get to know her better. 
We shall stay for a few days, and if you still  

489
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,840
think she is the right one for you - and she 
thinks you are the right one for her - then you  

490
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:40,640
will return with us and spend the rest of the 
year at our village." He smiles warmly. "Now,  

491
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:47,440
get going. If I know my daughter, she 
doesn't like being kept waiting..."
 
 
 

492
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,120
CHAPTER SIX

493
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,000
The Prophecy

494
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:01,120
He does not go straight back to his tent, 
but stops by the fight to see how it ends.  

495
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:10,320
It lasts for some time and gets ever more bitter. 
Well, at least Ilhan's father becomes more bitter.  

496
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,840
There is some blood too, even though the wounds 
are only small, harmless cuts. But Timucin is  

497
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:27,360
pleased when Tamer and Belmin step in and declare 
the fight a tie. Belmin's warrior looks happy and  

498
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:37,200
laughs as he embraces his opponent. Ilhan's father 
is clearly unhappy, however, and Timucin sees  

499
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,920
that he would quite happily take his sword and 
finish the fight if the two khans were not there.

500
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,280
The first fight is followed by others 
between Belmin's men and village warriors,  

501
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,200
most are just harmless tussles. The 
two khans, as well as most of the men,  

502
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,560
return to the fire to continue the celebrations, 
and Timucin sits down with them without having  

503
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:12,560
been asked. To judge by the look his father gives 
him, he does not like this, but he says nothing  

504
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,120
and lets Timucin sit next to 
him for far longer than usual.  

505
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:26,000
Not long before morning, Timucin finally 
gets up and goes to his yurt. He can almost  

506
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:34,240
feel the strange looks Belmin gives him like 
a warm hand between his shoulder blades.

507
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:42,000
It is dark and warm in his tent as he enters 
the tent. He has been hoping he will find  

508
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,840
Arbesa asleep, and her regular, shallow 
breathing seems to confirm this hope.  

509
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:54,560
Timucin does not make a light, and tries 
to undress without making any noise.  

510
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,840
The metal on his suit of armour makes this 
impossible, however, it clinks and rattles.  

511
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:11,120
Arbesa's breathing does not change. But 
when he slips under the warm sheepskin  

512
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:18,560
and carefully lies down back-to-back 
with her, she raises her head and speaks.

513
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:30,160
"So, all the fights are over and the 
great warrior returns tired from battle."  

514
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,920
Her voice is quiet, derogatory 
and not at all sleepy.

515
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,360
Timucin grounds his teeth in anger, not 
so much at Arbesa's words, but at himself  

516
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:52,720
for actually believing that, he would get off 
so lightly. His reason tells him to say nothing  

517
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:01,440
and pretend to be asleep; but this is perhaps 
the first, and definitely not the last time  

518
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:08,560
he realizes how pointless it is to use a 
word like reason when talking to a woman.

519
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,040
"It was just a bit of fun," he 
answers, without raising his head.

520
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:23,440
"Yes, of course. I think it's great fun 
to watch two men going at each other with  

521
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,480
sharp iron blades and hitting each 
other until they bleed," she replies.

522
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,760
This makes Timucin very angry, but he 
does not really know with whom he is so  

523
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:44,320
angry. He remains silent for a few moments, then 
he sits up, shoves the sheepskin to the side  

524
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,480
and feels around in the dark until he 
finds a flint and the small oil lamp.  

525
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:59,440
He is so angry that his hands are trembling and 
it takes him five or six attempts to get the wick.  

526
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:07,040
Once he has finally succeeded, he is still clumsy 
enough to burn his fingers on the tiny flame.  

527
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:14,960
Arbesa's eyes glint with disdain 
as he turns to her. She too  

528
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:23,280
has sat up and pushed the cover down to her 
knees. She is wearing nothing more than a very  

529
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:34,080
thin dress, through which Timucin can see almost 
everything. It embarrasses him. He looks down.

530
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:41,440
"Why are you so shy, great 
warrior?" asks Arbesa tauntingly.  

531
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,520
Timucin says nothing in reply, 
but feels himself going red again.

532
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:56,720
"You are not embarrassed, are you?" continues the 
girl, pretending to blink in surprise. "I mean,  

533
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:02,560
I don't know much about the customs of your 
people, but isn't it usual for the warrior  

534
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:11,520
to return to his woman after a successful day's 
battling and lie with her?" He does not answer.

535
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,960
After a brief pause, she adds:  

536
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:22,640
"Well, if they've survived and have 
more to do than just bleed in silence."

537
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,640
"You do not have to sleep here," says Timucin, 
annoyed. "If you do not like my company,  

538
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,320
I can quite happily ask my father to 
provide you with your own quarters."

539
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:44,560
Arbesa keeps smiling. The yellow light of 
the oil lamp makes her face appear even more  

540
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:52,960
beautiful than before, and despite his growing 
fury, he is incapable of turning away from her.  

541
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:01,840
Moreover, there is a brief moment in which she 
seems to realise that she may have gone too far  

542
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,160
and is frightened. It was, however,  

543
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:15,200
just a very brief moment, then her beautiful face 
becomes just as scornful as ever, if not worse.

544
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,080
"Then again," she continues, 
as if he has not said anything,  

545
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:27,440
"you look far better without those silly 
clothes. It must be awfully uncomfortable  

546
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,840
to walk around with more than your 
own weight on your body in iron."

547
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:40,240
Timucin instinctively looks down at himself, and 
Arbesa says quietly and, although he would not  

548
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:47,840
have thought it possible, more scornfully: 
"Just don't you go getting any ideas."

549
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:56,640
"Ideas? I don't know what to think at 
all," replies Timucin sharply. Well,  

550
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:05,600
he means it to sound sharp, but it sounds more 
pathetic than anything, even to his own ears.  

551
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:11,360
He is so red that he does not really 
need the lamp to light up his yurt.

552
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:19,520
Arbesa stops talking and, although Timucin 
is not looking at her directly, he can feel  

553
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,720
that her facial expression has changed. After 
what seems like an eternity, she speaks again.

554
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,360
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 
hurt you." Timucin is surprised.

555
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,840
"You didn't hurt me," says Timucin, 
lying without much conviction.  

556
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,400
"And you need not apologise to anyone", he adds.

557
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,160
"Why?" says Arbesa with a furrowed brow.

558
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,280
"Because you might be the wife of 
a khan one of these days," he says,  

559
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:01,680
"and the wife of a khan never 
apologizes to anyone for anything."

560
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,760
The girl looks at him 
thoughtfully for a long moment.

561
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:16,480
"And who taught you such rubbish?" she 
asks in a soft but confused tone of voice.

562
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,080
"My father!" answers Timucin loudly. 
"And it is not rubbish! It is the truth!"

563
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,600
"Because your father is the 
khan, and because the khan  

564
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:37,280
always speaks the truth, even if what he 
says is not true, you mean?" asks Arbesa.

565
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:46,640
In that instant, her words make Timucin so angry 
that he would like to grab her and shake her  

566
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:53,920
until she takes them back and says she is sorry. 
Then he realizes what he has just been thinking  

567
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,600
and laughs at himself against his own will.

568
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,800
"You're probably right," he says.

569
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,640
Arbesa is quiet again for a while.  

570
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:14,640
She sits up again, pulls her knees to her body 
and wraps her arms around them, and Timucin  

571
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:23,440
finds it more and more difficult not to blatantly 
stare at her. He manages it somehow, but he is  

572
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:31,440
relatively sure that the girl knows what is going 
on inside him. Not that he understands it himself.

573
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,120
"I didn't want to offend 
you," says Arbesa finally.

574
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,200
"You haven't offended me," replies Timucin 
and realizes only as he speaks these words  

575
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,000
that they are the truth. She has not offended him.

576
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,640
"But tell me, why are you so hostile?"

577
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:06,880
"Am I so hostile?" asks Arbesa. She leans her 
chin on her knees and looks up at him, amused.  

578
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:15,600
Then she shrugs her shoulders. There is 
something about the mischievous glint in her eyes  

579
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:24,960
that makes Timucin remember something vaguely, but 
he does not know what. Whatever it is, however,  

580
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:34,800
it is familiar and fills him with a feeling of 
sudden warmth. The feeling is so strong that  

581
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:41,920
he has to stop himself from just hugging her. 
"I'm just not used to all of this, you know."

582
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,680
"All of what?" asks Timucin.

583
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,400
"All these warriors and weapons 
and fun you have fighting."

584
01:11:53,680 --> 01:12:00,000
"I understand," says Timucin, 
"I've heard tell that your tribe is  

585
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,320
very peaceful." He does not think 
that he has said anything wrong,  

586
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:11,360
but suddenly Arbesa raises her head and an 
angry crease appears between her thin eyebrows.

587
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,960
"That's right, just go ahead and 
say what you think!" she snaps.  

588
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,840
"You think we are tribe of cowards, 
don't you? That we don't like fighting."  

589
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:30,480
Timucin is about to contradict this, and will 
probably end up apologizing to her again, but the  

590
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:37,280
girl does not let him speak a word. She continues 
speaking, louder than before and more angrily.

591
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,280
"You needn't have any qualms 
about speaking freely.  

592
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,320
I may still be a child, but I know very well 
what other tribes think and say about us."

593
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:54,080
"I did not say that I thought your people 
were cowards," says Timucin in his defence,  

594
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,280
"but what kind of khan has 
a tribe without warriors?"

595
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:09,040
"A very wise khan, perhaps?" asks Arbesa. Her fury 
disappears as quickly as it came. Yet something  

596
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:17,840
has changed. The tender bond between them that 
appeared a few moments back has been torn.

597
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,320
"But how do you expect to defend 
your land and your property  

598
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:27,440
against enemies who may want to rob you 
of it?" asks Timucin half-heartedly.

599
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,520
"No one has tried as yet," answers Arbesa softly.

600
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:39,360
"Yes, perhaps because there is no honour 
in winning against an enemy that cannot  

601
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:46,080
defend itself," replies Timucin. 
He regrets having said these words  

602
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,040
as soon as he has said them. 
Arbesa is not offended though;  

603
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,800
she simply shrugs her shoulders and nods in 
the direction of the entrance to the tent.

604
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,040
"How odd. I thought I just watched my 
bodyguard win against your man. Simply  

605
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:13,920
because my people do not enjoy fighting, we are 
not defenseless. You should try to listen to her."

606
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:22,880
"To her?" asks Timucin, not understanding what 
Arbesa means. She does not answer, however,  

607
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:28,640
and lies down, pulls up the cover to 
her shoulders and turns herself in it  

608
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,760
so that there is nothing left for Timucin to 
protect himself from the cold of the night.

609
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:42,080
He sits silently for some time looking at the 
girl as she pretends to sleep before he puts  

610
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:51,600
out the light. He lies straight and waits for 
either sleep or the cold, whichever comes first.

611
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:02,960
The cold is the first of the two, and it 
stops him sleeping. After a while, however,  

612
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:09,840
Timucin finds himself once again in the 
silvery moonlight of his dream world.  

613
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:21,440
Usually (not always, but almost always), he has 
difficulty making out exact forms in his dreams,  

614
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:32,000
but tonight he can see more than just vague 
ghosts under a starry sky. It is still a dark,  

615
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:42,560
nighttime world, but not quite as impenetrable 
as usual. Behind Sarantuya, he can see hills on  

616
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:52,800
a distant horizon covered by woods, and a silver, 
winding river. No steppe, and no traces of people.  

617
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:03,040
Timucin can feel that this is a world untouched 
by the hand of man. He has an almost physical  

618
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:12,720
sense of great age and of indescribable power, 
and this comes not only from the huge dragon,  

619
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:20,720
but from the fabric of this world itself, a 
world which Sarantuya does not often let him see.

620
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:32,640
"Now, did I promise too much?" asks Sarantuya. 
She is in a cheerful mood - well, as cheerful  

621
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:42,080
as a dragon the size of ten oxen can appear, at 
least. There is a glint of mischief in her eyes,  

622
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:49,280
and her long, scaly tail seems to thump on 
the floor to the rhythm of some silent music.

623
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,400
"Wasn't that an exciting day? Well? Wasn't it?"

624
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:07,520
"Yes," admits Timucin. Then he pulls a face. 
"Well, at least it was for some of us here."

625
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:14,960
"Oh, don't be like that about it!" 
answers the dragon in a jovial tone,  

626
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,240
which Timucin just does not understand.

627
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,440
"Come on! Every man in the village would give his  

628
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,400
eye teeth to share his yurt with the 
daughter of such of a mighty khan!"

629
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:34,080
"Yes, but she is a pain in 
the neck!" says Timucin.

630
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,480
"Pain in the neck? We have 
heard those words spoken before  

631
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:48,400
about the son of certain khan in your 
village..." The dragon lays her head sideways.

632
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,800
"So why is she such a pain? 
Because she says the truth?"

633
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:04,080
Timucin is offended, but does not say anything; 
he knows there is no use. When Sarantuya  

634
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,000
has decided to talk about a certain topic, 
then she talks about it - and that is that.

635
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:18,080
"Yes, but she laughed at me," he says 
after some time, "and insulted my father."

636
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,840
"No, she didn't," says Sarantuya, shaking 
her head so that he does not start to  

637
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:32,880
contradict her. Her smile disappears 
and her face looks worried, quizzical.

638
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:41,440
"Nevertheless, I feel resentment in 
you, my young friend. What went wrong?"

639
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:50,960
At first, Timucin wants to deny everything, 
but that would be pointless. Even if Timucin  

640
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,240
tries to hide things, Sarantuya can 
read his thoughts and he knows it.  

641
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:02,000
Nevertheless, she always insists 
on him saying them out loud.

642
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
"Chuzir," he admits.

643
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:11,680
"Your friend or, I beg your 
pardon, your brother in oath now.  

644
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,240
That makes him more than 
just a friend, doesn't it?"

645
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,400
"Some brother in oath!" says 
Timucin. "He told everyone about it!"

646
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:29,360
"About what?" asks the dragon, 
pretending not to know.

647
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:35,360
"About the thing with the dog," he 
answers angrily. "Now everyone in the  

648
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,000
village knows that I am afraid of dogs. 
Not just my father, but all of them."

649
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,840
"And what is so bad about that? I know that you 
know this already, but I shall say it again:  

650
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:56,080
even the heart of the bravest 
warrior is not free of fear.  

651
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:06,480
Only the most stupid people have no fear of 
anything, and these people do not live very long.  

652
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:13,120
But that is beside the point. 
Even we dragons know fear."

653
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,600
"Fear of what?"

654
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:25,920
"You would not understand it," answers Sarantuya 
mysteriously. "And this is not what we are talking  

655
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:34,800
about. Now, tell me, what is so bad about 
everyone knowing you are afraid of something?"

656
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:44,560
"Not just something," answers Timucin, 
"but dogs! Mangy little mutts!  

657
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:50,800
Everyone will laugh at me." Well, to be 
precise, they are already laughing, he thinks.

658
01:20:52,960 --> 01:21:01,120
"No one will laugh at you when you are khan," 
says Sarantuya. "And what takes more courage?  

659
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,680
To face the scorn of your tribesmen because of 
who you are, or to fight with - what did you call  

660
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:18,640
it - a mangy little mutt? You could have beaten 
it to death if you had wanted. You are strong."  

661
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,760
"No, I am a coward," says Timucin bitterly.

662
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:34,880
"No, you are not!" says Sarantuya, almost 
angrily. "You were afraid of this dog,  

663
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:40,240
but you were even more afraid of people 
finding this out and laughing at you.  

664
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:49,040
A real coward kills what he fears, so 
that no one finds out about his fear."

665
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:59,360
Timucin thinks about the mighty teeth and the 
wild look in the dog's eyes. He doubts whether  

666
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,960
the animal really was all that harmless, 
but does not say anything for the moment.

667
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,000
"I still don't understand why he did it, though!"  

668
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,280
he continues. "He is supposed to be my 
best friend, and he betrayed me! Why?"

669
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,040
"Because, unlike you,  

670
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:33,840
in the depths of his heart he really is a coward!" 
answers Sarantuya quietly. "And he is furious."

671
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:42,640
"Furious? At me? But why me? I 
have never done anything to him!"  

672
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:50,560
"He missed the dog. For the first 
time ever he missed a target,  

673
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:58,800
and he blames you. And he is not entirely 
wrong, if you think about it a moment."

674
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,080
"Why? Because my arrow was bent?" says Timucin.

675
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:13,600
"Well, that is certainly what he thinks," 
says Sarantuya, winking conspiratorially,  

676
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:20,240
"but you and I both know why he really missed."

677
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:28,640
Timucin keeps quiet. What Sarantuya says 
does not make anything better. In any case,  

678
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,840
it is unimportant why he is 
to blame for Chuzir's failure.

679
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:39,760
"He is already regretting having 
told everyone," says Sarantuya,  

680
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:47,840
"so don't be angry with him. You 
are friends after all, right?"

681
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,320
"Well, that's what I thought until 
now, yes," says Timucin, upset.

682
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:05,440
"Friendship also means forgiving," says Sarantuya. 
"In fact, that is what it means above all."

683
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:14,880
Timucin is about to make a nasty comment when 
he notices movement in the corner of his eye  

684
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,840
and turns round, frightened. 
Something rushes away. It is big,  

685
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:30,880
scaly and snake-like, and disappears so quickly 
that he cannot make it out. Was it perhaps a...?

686
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:38,480
Surprised, he turns back to Sarantuya, who 
answers his question before he has asked it.

687
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,600
"Don't ask, my little friend.  

688
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:50,480
I can't answer, and he won't talk to you either. 
We only talk to the people we belong to."

689
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,080
It takes a moment for Timucin 
to understand what she means.

690
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:04,480
"So... you mean that somebody else here 
is speaking to a dragon right now?"  

691
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:11,600
he murmurs. A moment ago, he would 
never have believed that dragons  

692
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:18,720
could grin. But Sarantuya can, 
and she grins almost shamelessly.

693
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,200
"Yes. For some time, too!"

694
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:33,200
It takes Timucin even longer to understand, 
then he turns around half-terrified to Arbesa.  

695
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:43,040
She is not there, of course, because 
this is just a dream. Sarantuya giggles.

696
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:53,840
"Arbesa?" he murmurs skeptically. 
"You mean... she too has a dragon?"

697
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,680
"Well, actually it's us dragons who have you  

698
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:07,840
and not you us," says Sarantuya, a 
little offended, "but yes, she does."

699
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,440
"Oh," says Timucin.

700
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:20,400
"Oh. Yes 'oh' indeed" says Sarantuya, 
making fun of his tone of voice.

701
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,240
"So you thought you were the only one?"

702
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:33,520
"If I'm honest, yes I did." In 
fact, if he is completely honest,  

703
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:40,000
he is not even sure whether 
Sarantuya actually exists at all.

704
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,400
"Well, in that case, I'm going 
to have to disappoint you,"  

705
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:52,320
says Sarantuya, teasing him, "you're not 
as special as all that, my little Khan!"

706
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,440
"But why did Arbesa not say 
anything about it?" mumbles Timucin.

707
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,040
"Why should she? She doesn't know you at all."  

708
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:13,440
Timucin thinks back: in fact, 
she did say something about it.

709
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:22,320
"Anyway, it's nothing special to her. Almost 
everyone in her tribe has a dragon-friend."

710
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,960
"The whole tribe?" says Timucin, astonished.

711
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,000
"Well, almost all of them," answers Sarantuya,  

712
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:41,840
"because they are a very peaceful people, 
and dragons love peaceful people."

713
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:53,120
"What? Dragons, of all creatures!" he says. 
He regrets this immediately, but of course,  

714
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:59,840
Sarantuya would have heard these words even if 
he had just thought them. She looks offended,  

715
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,960
upset and ever so slightly angry.

716
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:14,880
"You think that, just because we are big 
and strong, we are dangerous?" she asks.  

717
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:23,360
Timucin discovers that it is possible to 
blush in a dream too. He keeps silent.

718
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:30,800
"We are big and very strong," continues 
Sarantuya, sounding suddenly very serious  

719
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:36,320
and still slightly angry, "so no 
one can be of any danger to us,  

720
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:43,600
but why should this make us into 
beasts? We are not like you people!"

721
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,880
Timucin wants to say something, but 
Sarantuya motions him to keep quiet with an  

722
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,400
astonishingly human movement of her right paw.

723
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:03,360
"I know what people say about us. You all 
think we are monsters, horrible monsters who  

724
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:09,840
eat people and animals and burn 
land with our breath of fire."  

725
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,880
She winks at him before continuing. 
"That's about the size of it, right?"

726
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,080
"Hm," says Timucin.

727
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:28,320
"But that is not the way it is. We are 
just as big and strong as you think,  

728
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:38,240
even stronger - just one of us could wipe your 
tribe off the face of the earth. But why would we  

729
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:48,000
do that? No dragon has ever killed a person, and 
we never shall, as long as you are in existence."

730
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:55,280
"I'm sorry," murmurs Timucin, 
"I didn't mean to hurt you."

731
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:05,840
"I know," says Sarantuya in her usual, 
softer tones. Suddenly, she starts giggling.

732
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:14,480
"Did I just mishear something, or did you 
just say sorry to me, son of the khan?"

733
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,640
Timucin is silent and Sarantuya is serious again.

734
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,200
"Well, you would have asked 
that question at some point,  

735
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:33,840
and I've just answered it. Perhaps this was the 
right moment, now that you have met your wife."

736
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,320
"We are not married yet!" objects Timucin,  

737
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:45,440
but Sarantuya shakes her head, her 
scales jingling lightly as she does.

738
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:53,680
"She will be your wife, young Khan. You 
will live a long and happy life together,  

739
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,840
even though you will betray her one day."

740
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,920
"Me? Never!" says Timucin, outraged.

741
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:13,280
"Yes, yes, you will," says Sarantuya softly, 
"but don't worry - she will forgive you."

742
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:20,960
"You can see into the future?" 
says Timucin, eyes wide open.

743
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,960
"Not everything," says Sarantuya,  

744
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,800
"We dragons do not see into the 
future, not in the way you think."

745
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,160
"Well, you did predict that I was going to meet 
somebody who would be of great importance to me."

746
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:47,680
"That wasn't the future, my little friend that was 
just one day. But we do see a lot, that is true.  

747
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:57,840
Some of the paths into the future are clear and 
wide, some thin and blurred, or even forked.  

748
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:06,480
I can tell you that Arbesa will become your wife 
and that you will live long and happily together.  

749
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,040
What you do in that time is 
up to you. I can't see that."

750
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:19,280
"And even if you could see it, you 
wouldn't tell me," says Timucin.

751
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,160
"That's true," answers Sarantuya cheerfully,  

752
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,840
"but you will find the right way 
in any case. I'm almost sure!"

753
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:32,400
"Almost?"

754
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,400
"Almost," insists Sarantuya, 
"because even we dragons don't know  

755
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:47,360
everything. We have neither the right nor 
the power to get involved in your lives.  

756
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:56,720
But you have a good heart and I believe in 
you. Otherwise I wouldn't have chosen you1."

757
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,080
"Chosen?" repeats Timucin.

758
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:06,720
"We dragons choose the people to 
whom we wish to offer our friendship,  

759
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:14,800
and we choose very carefully. 
Only those who are pure of heart  

760
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:24,080
and who do not go the way of the sword will 
ever know us." Sarantuya hesitates for a moment,  

761
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:29,920
as if she is not sure if she should 
continue talking or not, but she does.

762
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,840
"You have never spoken of me 
to your father, am I right?"

763
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,000
Timucin answers with a shake of 
his head, and Sarantuya continues.

764
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:51,760
"And perhaps you shouldn't. Did you know 
that he too once had a dragon companion?"  

765
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,560
Timucin's eyes open wide.

766
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,000
"What? My father? The khan?"

767
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:11,761
"Before he was khan," answers Sarantuya, "at 
about your age." She laughs good-temperedly.  

768
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:21,200
"I shouldn't tell you of course... 
but... but he too was afraid."

769
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,320
"Of dogs?"

770
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,840
"No, of horses!" chortled Sarantuya.

771
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:43,600
"Of horses?" gasps Timucin. "My father 
the khan was afraid of horses?!"

772
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:52,880
"He was not khan back then," answers Sarantuya, 
"and he faced and conquered his fear."  

773
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,920
Timucin needs a while to get used to this idea.

774
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,440
"And? What happened then?" he asks.

775
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:12,880
"He went the wrong way," answers Sarantuya 
in a way that makes it clear to Timucin that  

776
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:19,600
it is pointless to ask any further 
questions. She changes the subject.

777
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:29,280
"Back then, many of us had friends in your tribe. 
There was even a time when all of you had dragons.  

778
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:37,360
Why else do you think that so many of your tribe 
can remember us, without ever having seen us?"

779
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,160
"What happened?" asks Timucin.

780
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:52,640
"The same thing as almost always," answers 
Sarantuya sadly, "too many of you chose the wrong  

781
01:35:52,640 --> 01:36:04,000
path." Timucin can feel the dragon's sorrow 
and he realizes that he has hit upon a subject  

782
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:12,480
that she does not want to talk about. 
Nevertheless, he asks another question, quietly.

783
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:20,080
"And which path is the wrong path, exactly?"

784
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:30,640
"Later," answers Sarantuya, clearing her throat 
loudly, "perhaps I've already told you enough  

785
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:38,960
for one day. Just be patient, my little Khan. We 
will have plenty of opportunities to talk again,  

786
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:46,160
perhaps your whole life long. 
But that is your decision."
 
 
 

787
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:50,080
CHAPTER SEVEN

788
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,840
The Bodyguard

789
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:03,680
Arbesa has already gone when Timucin wakes 
up. It is at least an hour after sunrise, he  

790
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:11,600
has a horrible taste in his mouth and a throbbing 
headache. It is as if he hasn't just sat with the  

791
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:19,840
men, but also drunk the spirits made of fermented 
sheep's milk that they sometimes take to excess.  

792
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:29,920
Moreover, he still has the strange dream in his 
head - something to do with the dragon and Arbesa,  

793
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:36,800
although he cannot remember any precise 
details. He's probably breathed in too  

794
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:43,280
much smoke from the fire, which would explain 
both the headache and odd dreams, he thinks.

795
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,840
Where is Arbesa, though?

796
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:55,520
Timucin looks at the empty bed next to him and 
is almost annoyed, until he remembers that he  

797
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:04,000
is behaving like an old married man. Sarantuya 
has said that they will get married, but only at  

798
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:12,080
some point, and that is assuming that Timucin 
understood correctly, and assuming that she has  

799
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:19,440
actually spoken to him and that this is not all 
just some strange fantasy that he has experienced.  

800
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:30,960
That was no fantasy, though. His father used 
to be afraid of horses? How pathetic is that?!

801
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:40,000
Timucin curls his lip in scorn at the 
very thought of it, and stands up.  

802
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:49,440
The noises of village life penetrate into the 
tent, at once muffled and yet somehow urgent,  

803
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:58,880
too. He just manages to stop himself shaking his 
head to dispel his sleepiness - it would probably  

804
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:07,200
explode. He feels this bad without even having 
tasted a drop of the fermented sheep's milk.  

805
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,240
This is not the first time he asks himself  

806
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:17,760
what the warriors see in drinking themselves 
into unconsciousness night after night.

807
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:25,840
Anyway: his father used to be 
afraid of horses? Pathetic!

808
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:34,640
Timucin steps out of the tent, crouching as 
he goes. He feels like a grown warrior with  

809
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:43,440
a hangover as the bright morning sun stabs at his 
eyes, and he does not just blink, but has to grind  

810
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:52,000
his teeth to avoid groaning out loud. Normally, 
his father and the warriors behave like this  

811
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,760
in the morning when the night has been too short 
and too festive. He understands the attraction of  

812
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:07,680
drink less than ever this morning. What he does 
understand, though, is why the men are often so  

813
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:18,240
anxious to get down to the river. He feels dirty, 
his whole body is sticky, and his clothes and hair  

814
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:27,280
smell so badly of smoke that he almost feels ill. 
He wants nothing more than to get to the river,  

815
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:34,160
but before he sets off, he remembers that his 
father has asked him to make sure he is always  

816
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:41,760
dressed properly as long as there are guests in 
the village. So he gathers up all his armour and  

817
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:49,360
weapons into a bundle that he slings over his 
shoulder. As he makes his way to the hill, he  

818
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:59,600
groans under the weight of it. Arbesa was right: 
it weighs more than he does. Suddenly he is no  

819
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:06,880
longer angry at her for having gone; at least she 
does not have to see him in this miserable state.

820
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:14,320
He drags his feet up the hill without replying 
to any of the tribespeople who greet him.  

821
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:22,400
Then he crosses the patch of woods where 
he and Chuzir gave their oath, yawning  

822
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:29,280
and even stopping a couple of times to regain 
his strength. As he passes the bush into which  

823
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:35,200
the dog disappeared, an un-pleasant 
memory tries to break into his mind,  

824
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:44,000
but he ignores it and forces himself to think of 
nothing - which is not hard in his current state.

825
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:52,480
After what seems like an eternity, he can see the 
river shimmering through the undergrowth in front  

826
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:59,360
of him. He sets off faster towards the water and 
then throws his bundle of clothing and armour to  

827
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:06,960
the ground so that it rattles and jingles for a 
few moments. He reaches for his underwear and is  

828
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:14,960
about to pull it off over his head, when he sees 
something out of the corner of his eye and stops.

829
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:27,680
Something or someone is splashing in the water. 
Timucin looks closely and notices that he is  

830
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:39,520
blushing again; someone is swimming in the shallow 
waters of the Omon. That someone is Arbesa. She is  

831
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:50,960
wearing less than the night before. Well, nothing. 
And the water is so clear that it hides nothing.  

832
01:42:53,120 --> 01:43:01,120
If she finds it as embarrassing as Timucin, she 
hides it masterfully as she kicks around in the  

833
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,600
water lying on her back and looking up at him 
with her glinting eyes. She does not even have  

834
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:14,880
the decency to pretend to be embarrassed, and 
is having a lot of fun at Timucin's expense.

835
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:23,280
"My, oh my, our great warrior is 
already awake!" she says teasingly,  

836
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,600
picking up last night's conversation 
as if there has been no interruption.

837
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,440
"Astonishing! Don't you need more time 
to recover from the great battle?"

838
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:42,720
"Good morning to you, too!" growls Timucin. 
Last night, when Sarantuya told him about  

839
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:48,160
his future with Arbesa, he still liked 
the idea despite their misunderstanding,  

840
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:55,840
but perhaps one should not believe everything 
dragons say, especially female dragons.

841
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:01,360
He is close to taking off his 
clothes and jumping into the water,  

842
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:11,600
but then he reconsiders and wades into the icy 
water, his teeth chattering as he goes. Arbesa  

843
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:16,240
moves a little aside but doesn't 
let him out of her vision for an  

844
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:23,840
instant. She looks even more scornfully in 
his direction, but what else can he expect?

845
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:30,800
"Does your tribe always wash 
with its clothes on?" she asks.

846
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:40,080
Timucin looks at her angrily, dives under and 
stays below the waterline until his lungs are  

847
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:47,200
crying out for air and his heart 
is about to burst. He resurfaces,  

848
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:54,160
spluttering and gasping for air, runs his hands 
though his long, wet hair and then answers.

849
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:05,120
"Only if the water is dirty or full of vermin." 
Arbesa looks at him confused, shrugs her shoulders  

850
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:15,840
and then paddles away on her back using only her 
hands and feet. Then, however, she turns back in  

851
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:22,960
order to circle around him, getting closer 
and closer, like a predator around its prey.

852
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:31,280
He dives again, swims underwater back to the bank 
and wades back out of the water, soaking wet.  

853
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:38,720
If Arbesa were not there, he would have 
taken his underwear off now and wrung it out,  

854
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:47,520
but she keeps looking at him. So he runs his 
hands over his undergarments and bends down to  

855
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:54,320
pick up his bundle. He threw it carelessly, so 
he spends quite some time untangling it before  

856
01:45:54,320 --> 01:46:00,960
he can put his clothes on. His wet underwear 
makes every movement more difficult, however,  

857
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:09,200
and sticks to his body as he goes. He is annoyed 
when he thinks about how long it will take to dry  

858
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:14,640
under all this leather, and his skin 
already feels cold enough as it is.

859
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:25,840
Arbesa must be thinking the same; even without 
turning to her, he can feel her scornful gaze.  

860
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:29,920
Sarantuya might have 
predicted he would betray her,  

861
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:36,000
but perhaps the dragon was wrong: he feels 
more like drowning her than anything else.

862
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:45,600
Without saying a word, he finishes dressing 
himself, not because he really wants to or  

863
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:52,240
because his father has asked him to, but more than 
any-thing because of what Arbesa said to him last  

864
01:46:52,240 --> 01:47:01,520
night. He even puts on his belt and weapons 
as well as his shield and helmet. Only then,  

865
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,840
does he turn to the water and see that Arbesa 
really has been watching him the whole time.  

866
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:18,080
Her eyes are still as wide and defiant as ever. 
Suddenly, he remembers what they remind of him: of  

867
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,240
Sarantuya. Arbesa has Sarantuya's  

868
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,200
eyes!

869
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:31,680
It is almost as if he does not want 
to, but he asks her a question.

870
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,840
"What is she called?"

871
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:46,640
"He." She keeps smiling, and something comes into 
her eyes that touches and warms him for a brief  

872
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:56,480
instant. "I'm a girl, and our dragons are 
always male. Just like yours are always female."

873
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:05,120
"Now I understand what the warriors mean when 
they talk about their wives," he replies,  

874
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:12,400
grinning. Arbesa smiles back, but her 
eyes keep their strange new expression.

875
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:22,640
"Tselmeg. His name is Tselmeg." She 
paddles around in the water a little more  

876
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:28,080
as if she is waiting for an answer, and when 
she does not get one, she turns her back to  

877
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:36,640
him. Timucin clears his throat awkwardly, 
starts to turn around and stops still.

878
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:50,960
His good mood disappears again instantly and his 
face darkens. He is no longer alone; just a little  

879
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:57,840
behind him, four or five boys climb out of the 
bush into which the dog had disappeared the day  

880
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:07,040
before yesterday. One of them is Chuzir, another 
is Ilhan, and the other three are Ilhan's most  

881
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:17,840
trusted friends - and the worst bullies in the 
tribe. At first, they just stand there staring at  

882
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:27,840
him; all except Chuzir are smiling threateningly 
and Timucin's heart starts to beat faster.

883
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:37,040
"Uh oh," sneers Arbesa, "now our big, 
strong warrior has a bit of a problem.  

884
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:42,640
But it won't be too bad - I 
mean, he is armed, at least."

885
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:51,760
Although she is only saying this to rib him, and 
he knows it, Timucin does not feel like laughing  

886
01:49:51,760 --> 01:50:02,320
right now. The sight of the five boys scares him. 
They too are armed, Chuzir with his bow and arrow,  

887
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:07,280
the four others with clubs that they 
have clearly just cut from the trees.  

888
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:15,920
What use is his sword now? He is not 
going to run at them with a bare blade.

889
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:24,640
If fighting is at all necessary. Timucin 
thinks for a moment, and although his heart  

890
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:33,120
is still beating fast, he realizes that he does 
not yet know what they want. Perhaps they are  

891
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:40,000
just here by chance, and he remembers what his 
father has often told him: if you show fear,  

892
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,480
your enemy will see it too. Don't show 
fear, and they will avoid a fight.

893
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:56,800
"And who is saying anything about fighting 
anyway?" whispers someone to him from behind  

894
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:05,840
his forehead. As he steps towards the boys, he 
realizes it is Sarantuya's voice and stops again.  

895
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:15,360
The dragon is there, invisible 
to all except him. It is strange  

896
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:21,840
that she is there: this is the first 
time he has heard her voice whilst awake.  

897
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:30,080
Something very important must have happened. 
Without even being aware of it, he looks left  

898
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:35,920
and right. The dragon is 
nowhere to be seen, of course,  

899
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:45,600
but Ilhan and his friends notice the move and a 
wide, sneering grin spreads across Ilhan's face.

900
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,800
"Don't you worry, oh mighty Khan," he 
scoffs, "there aren't any dogs around."

901
01:51:55,040 --> 01:52:02,240
Timucin sucks air through his teeth and 
then walks on, holding his shoulders  

902
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:10,320
as straight as he can. His right hand is 
on the hilt of his sword, as if it had just  

903
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:17,200
landed there, but this does not have the effect 
he expects and Ilhan's grin just gets broader.

904
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:27,920
"Well, look at that! Our future khan has put 
on his sword and shield in order to defend the  

905
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:35,280
honour of his bride. Then again," he continues, 
looking lewdly in the direction of the river,  

906
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,480
"it does not seem like there is 
much to defend in this case."

907
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:52,000
For an instant, Timucin sees red. For a short 
moment, he must stop himself actually pulling  

908
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:01,920
his sword and cutting Ilhan's stupid smile out of 
his face. Then, however, he calls himself down.  

909
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:11,840
He and Arbesa have done nothing dishonorable, 
and nakedness is not a taboo in the tribe.

910
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:18,320
Men, women and children often 
wash in the river together,  

911
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:26,480
and they never wear clothes like he just 
has. Ilhan is just trying to get him angry.

912
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:38,560
"What do you want?" he asks in a strong voice. He 
is careful not to look at Chuzir as he says this,  

913
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:48,320
but his brother in oath licks his lips nervously 
and looks away quickly nonetheless. Timucin  

914
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:54,880
thinks back to what Sarantuya told him last 
night and sees that it was the truth. Chuzir  

915
01:53:54,880 --> 01:54:03,920
is already regretting his mistake, but why is he 
here with the others, then? Timucin is confused.

916
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:15,680
Sarantuya answers him silently: Because 
he cannot go back. One mistake all too  

917
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:22,560
often leads directly to another if the person 
making it does not have the courage to face it.

918
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:30,240
"Oh, we just wanted to make sure 
that our future khan and his bride  

919
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:34,080
are not in any danger," answers Ilhan.

920
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:43,280
"Woof woof!" adds one of the other boys. 
Timucin ignores this and replies coldly.

921
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:48,880
"Well, everything is fine, 
thanks. It is good to see,  

922
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,960
however, that you already know the 
debt you owe your future ruler."

923
01:54:54,720 --> 01:55:04,800
Chuzir takes a small, nervous step backwards; 
Ilhan's hand grasps his club tighter.

924
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,000
His eyes flash with fury.

925
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:17,920
"Don't be too sure about that, Timucin," 
he growls, "you are not yet khan."

926
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:22,720
"And if I were, that shouldn't stop 
you," answers Timucin defiantly.  

927
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,360
"Just imagine that I am some 
boy, any boy, from the village."

928
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:34,560
"Hm, I'm having trouble doing that," answers Ilhan  

929
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:41,040
icily, "because all the other boys in the 
village have the heart of a true warrior."

930
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,200
He is only trying to provoke you,  

931
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:53,680
whispers Sarantuya, and there is no shame 
in avoiding a fight that you cannot win.

932
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:01,360
His father has already told him this more 
than once, and it always sounded obvious  

933
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:08,160
and convincing. Oddly enough, however, it 
does not sound so obvious or convincing now.  

934
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:19,200
In fact, Timucin feels pure rage welling up inside 
him, but fear at the same time. There are four of  

935
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:27,840
them - not counting Chuzir - and Ilhan on his 
own is stronger than him. So he says nothing.

936
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:35,520
Suddenly, the bigger boy smiles a 
broad and unmistakably dirty smile.

937
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:44,560
"We do beg your pardon, oh most noble 
Khan," he says in a smutty tone,  

938
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:51,200
"if you want to be alone with your 
bride, we'll happily turn round. Unless  

939
01:56:52,080 --> 01:57:01,520
you need help..." The other boys, except 
Chuzir, greet this comment with dirty laughter.

940
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,480
"Take that back!" hisses Timucin.

941
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:15,440
"What if I don't?" asks Ilhan. Timucin 
looks down at the club in Ilhan's hand.  

942
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:21,840
Ilhan shrugs his shoulders and 
sends it flying into the bushes.

943
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:26,960
"Just so you can't say we were unfair about it.  

944
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:34,560
You are welcome to use your sword, however, great 
Khan - at least then we would be about even."

945
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:42,480
"I don't want to fight you," says Timucin, who 
is almost surprised as he hears his own words.  

946
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:52,080
"We have one blood; why should we strike one 
another?" Ilhan pulls a mock-disappointed face.

947
01:57:53,200 --> 01:58:02,480
"Hmm, why? Perhaps because I do not want to 
serve a khan who is a coward?" he suggests.

948
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:11,440
Timucin does not reply to this, but suddenly 
feels a tension in his thoughts that does not come  

949
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:19,360
from him. Sarantuya is looking at him 
and clearly expects a certain reaction,  

950
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:28,240
but he does not know which. Besides, he is 
terribly afraid. He has understood that there  

951
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:36,080
is no way he can avoid this fight. Ilhan and 
the others have come to fight him here and now,  

952
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:41,360
and have chosen this moment so that 
Arbesa will see - for whatever reason.

953
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:46,320
Instead of answering, he takes off his shield,  

954
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:52,400
slowly lays it down on the floor 
and then removes his sword and belt.  

955
01:58:53,760 --> 01:59:01,920
Ilhan stops his pretend surprise, shrugs 
his shoulders, and then nods at his friends.

956
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:10,480
"Well, what do you know? Our little khan 
shows courage! Now, show us what you've got!"  

957
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,040
This is the cue for one of 
the boys to go into the bushes  

958
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:19,520
and come back with a string on 
which a dog has been leashed.

959
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:28,480
On closer inspection, however, it appears to be 
something that thinks it is a dog, because it  

960
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:37,600
smaller than most cats, has a mangy coat, and 
is slobbering so badly that it has left a wet  

961
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:46,480
trail behind it. One of its ears has been torn 
off. It growls quietly when it sees Timucin.

962
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:56,480
"Now don't be afraid, oh great Khan," smirks 
Ilhan, his three stooges laughing spitefully,  

963
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:04,800
"and if this terrifying beast gets too dangerous, 
just say the word and we'll do what we can."  

964
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:16,800
On this, the boy lets the dog loose and it runs 
straight at Timucin, barking furiously as it goes.  

965
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:26,560
It is a pathetic creature, and not even Timucin 
can be afraid of it. Nevertheless, he takes a  

966
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:37,920
step back, perhaps out of reflex, and Ilhan laughs 
loudly. Meanwhile, invisible and silent, Sarantuya  

967
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:46,480
stretches her wings and, just as it about to 
reach Timucin, the dog jumps back in fear,  

968
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:54,400
runs around looking scared and then runs back with 
its tail between its legs, squeaking as it goes.  

969
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:02,960
Ilhan looks surprised, truly, 
but then his face darkens.

970
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:10,320
"Fine," he growls, "but let's see if 
you can scare off something that isn't  

971
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:16,560
ten times smaller than you!" He lunges 
at Timucin with his fists curled.

972
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:23,120
It is more a reflex than anything else that 
helps Timucin to fend off his first punch,  

973
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:30,800
but the sheer force of Ilhan's wild attack throws 
Timucin to the ground and Ilhan rams his knee  

974
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:38,000
so hard against his chest that it is probably 
only his armour that saves his ribs from being  

975
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:42,822
broken like little twigs. The air whistles out 
of his lungs and, for a second, his vision is  

976
02:01:42,822 --> 02:01:51,199
clouded by red pain. His heart explodes in fear 
and he would scream if he had enough air. Ilhan  

977
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:58,080
bellows triumphantly, punches him a few times 
in the face and knocks his arms back without  

978
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:06,560
any effort at all, as he tries to hit back. The 
next punch splits his bottom lip; then his nose  

979
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:11,760
starts to bleed; the punch after that 
almost sends him into unconsciousness.

980
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:20,960
Sarantuya! Help me! In his 
mind, he is screaming for help.

981
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:29,760
Nothing happens. The dragon's wings 
do not come to save him this time,  

982
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:37,840
nor does fire rain down from the heavens. Ilhan 
just keeps hitting him, perhaps with even more  

983
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:45,040
strength than before. Timucin is afraid; as the 
punches get stronger, he starts to worry that  

984
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:52,640
he may die. He blindly feels around for anything 
hard and heavy that he can use to defend himself,  

985
02:02:52,640 --> 02:03:01,520
and finds the hilt of his sword. It sits neatly 
in the palm of his hand, it is heavy and sharp and  

986
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:11,760
gives him a feeling of safety. Even as Ilhan sits 
astride him raining down blows, he knows he can  

987
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:22,080
stop it all with just one movement. Then the blood 
flowing to the floor will not be his anymore.

988
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,840
Instead of using the sword, 
however, he drops it again  

989
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:34,240
and calls desperately in his 
thoughts for Sarantuya. Help me!

990
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,480
The dragon remains silent.  

991
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:48,080
Timucin can feel her presence so clearly, as if 
she were right behind him, but she says nothing.

992
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:53,680
"Stop!" shouts a furious, high-pitched voice.  

993
02:03:54,560 --> 02:04:00,720
Ilhan punches him in the face again, even 
harder, but then his weight disappears  

994
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:09,840
from Timucin's chest and Ilhan's mad 
laughter is replaced by surprised shouts.

995
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:18,560
Timucin pushes himself up onto his elbows, screws 
up his eyes to get rid of the blood and tears and  

996
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:27,680
then opens them wide as he sees who has come 
to help him. He has been counting on Chuzir,  

997
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:38,640
desperately hoping for him, but his brother in 
oath is standing looking lost and confused. Now  

998
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:45,120
it is Ilhan who is lying on his back 
covering his face with his hands;

999
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,080
the form who is kneeling on 
him, smacking him in the face  

1000
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:58,160
again and again, is about a head shorter than 
Timucin, has hip-length, raven-black hair  

1001
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:08,240
clinging to its skin in wet streaks, and is 
wearing nothing except this hair - and water.

1002
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:20,480
"Leave him alone!" screams Arbesa and every word 
is accompanied by another slap. Ilhan's face is  

1003
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:25,760
starting to turn red with all the smacking, 
despite Arbesa's hands being small and slim.

1004
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:34,320
"You call that courage? Four on one? You 
really are very brave warriors, aren't you?!"

1005
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:44,880
Ilhan finally overcomes his surprise and throws 
Arbesa off him with a rough movement. His face  

1006
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:54,160
is glowing red and is contorted with shame and 
fury; murderous rage is burning in his eyes.  

1007
02:05:55,040 --> 02:06:01,520
Timucin is almost completely sure than 
he will lunge at him again, but instead  

1008
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:07,040
Ilhan takes a step back and spits 
blood and phlegm on the grass.

1009
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:17,200
"Yes," he says contemptuously, "I should apologise 
to my khan; I did not know that his bodyguards  

1010
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:26,320
were so brave." With this, he turns on his heels 
and marches off, followed by his three stooges.  

1011
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:34,480
Chuzir stands still, not 
sure what to do, but does not  

1012
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:41,440
look Timucin in the eyes. After a moment, 
he too goes, almost as fast as the others.

1013
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,800
Timucin tries to get up, 
but everything is spinning;  

1014
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,960
his face hurts badly, every 
breath he takes causes him pain.  

1015
02:06:54,720 --> 02:07:03,120
It feels like Ilhan may well have broken one of 
his ribs. He feels Arbesa kneel down beside him,  

1016
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:12,080
stretch out her hand to him, but she does not 
dare to touch him. Then she does something,  

1017
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:20,640
which surprises him completely: she bends down 
to his face and blows a kiss on his cheek.

1018
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:28,080
"You were very brave, Timucin," 
she whispers in his ear.

1019
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:32,640
Timucin looks at her, confused.  

1020
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:39,840
He does not understand what she 
means. Brave? He has been a coward.

1021
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:42,320
"What?" he murmurs.

1022
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:53,680
"It was brave of you not to do it." 
Arbesa nods towards the sword. She smiles,  

1023
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:58,720
warmly and honestly, in a way 
she has not smiled at him yet.  

1024
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:07,840
Then she stands up and, in one flowing movement, 
puts out her hand to help him to his feet.  

1025
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:17,280
He is embarrassed, but he needs the help to get 
up. He starts to thank her and is about to make  

1026
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:25,280
a jokey remark to try and play down his weakness 
when he notices movement behind him and jumps  

1027
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:31,040
round, convinced that Ilhan and the others 
have come back to give him another drubbing.

1028
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:35,840
Instead, he sees his father.

1029
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:44,000
Tamer stands before him, silent 
and stony-faced between the trees.  

1030
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:51,840
Timucin understands that he has 
been there for some time, has seen  

1031
02:08:52,720 --> 02:09:03,840
everything. His father's stare cuts him 
like a knife. It is a look of contempt.
 
 
 

1032
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:07,040
CHAPTER EIGHT

1033
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,960
The Wisdom of the Dragons

1034
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:18,480
Why didn't you help me?" says Timucin 
to Sarantuya as soon as he has closed  

1035
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:25,520
his eyes and slid over into his dream 
world. "I thought you were my friend!"

1036
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:32,240
"I am," says the dragon, fluttering her eyelids,  

1037
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:36,480
"and you should count yourself 
lucky, too, if I may say so."

1038
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,960
"How so?" asks Timucin, annoyed.

1039
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:48,160
"Because you don't want me as your 
enemy, little Khan. No one does."  

1040
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:55,440
For just a moment, there is something in 
her eyes that he has never seen before,  

1041
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:04,320
that he has never felt in her before and that 
makes him go ice- cold to the depth of his soul.  

1042
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:10,720
This feeling disappears too quickly 
for him to become frightened, however,  

1043
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:15,760
and Sarantuya resumes her 
usual, wide dragon-smile.

1044
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:24,000
"And besides," she adds in a changed, 
almost cheerful tone, "I did help you!"

1045
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,840
"Ha!" snorts Timucin.

1046
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:33,920
"Did I not repel that bloodthirsty beast 
that wanted to tear you to pieces?"

1047
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:42,960
"Do you mean that yapping little piece of scum?" 
replies Timucin with a dismissive tone. "That was  

1048
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:48,320
great of you, but I think I would have 
just about been able to handle it, thanks."

1049
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,840
"Are you sure?" asks Sarantuya, mock clueless.

1050
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:00,080
"You know exactly what I mean," snarls Timucin,  

1051
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:04,880
"although I didn't even want you to tear 
off their heads or anything like that."

1052
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:07,920
"What did you want, then?"

1053
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:12,320
"Perhaps if you had just 
frightened them off a bit.  

1054
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:16,560
You know, filled their hearts with 
fear or something of that nature."

1055
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:23,840
"They are already so afraid that there is 
no more room for fear," answers the dragon,  

1056
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:31,680
"but I know what you mean. It would have 
been just lovely if they had run off scared  

1057
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:36,640
and then thought that, they were scared 
of you. Would you have liked that?"

1058
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:40,160
"Yes," answers Timucin.

1059
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:50,320
"So you like people to be afraid of you?" asks 
the dragon. Timucin is about to nod automatically,  

1060
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:56,720
but then he is not sure whether he really 
does want people to be afraid of him.

1061
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:07,840
"I think you fought very bravely - well, for 
a man. Not by dragon standards, of course..."

1062
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:14,640
"What? I just got punched the whole 
time!" growls Timucin resentfully.

1063
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:21,920
"Well, if I remember correctly, 
Ilhan got the odd smack too!  

1064
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:29,760
And believe you me, they hurt him far more 
than the punches he gave you hurt you,"  

1065
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:37,680
says the dragon, giggling, "because that kind of 
lad really dislikes getting beaten up by a girl!"

1066
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:45,120
Not as much as I dislike being saved 
by one, though, thinks Timucin.  

1067
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:51,920
Instinctively, he turns to the 
left, where Arbesa is sleeping  

1068
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:59,760
next to him. He cannot actually see her in his 
dream world, but he can still feel her presence.  

1069
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:08,880
He feels warmth and comfort like he has not felt 
since lying in his mother's arms as a small boy,  

1070
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:17,440
but this is different. It is more 
intimate and much, much sweeter.

1071
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:25,200
Sarantuya does not try to even pretend 
that she is not reading his thoughts.

1072
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:34,000
"You are ashamed of being helped by a girl, 
but you accuse me of not having helped, too!"

1073
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:40,320
"Yes, but you're a dragon, 
not a girl!" hisses Timucin.

1074
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,680
"But I was one, once," 
answers Sarantuya snappishly,  

1075
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:53,200
"and that wasn't all that long ago 
either. Those millennia just fly by..."  

1076
02:13:53,200 --> 02:14:00,640
she giggles again, then sighs deeply 
and is suddenly very serious again.

1077
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,200
"You did not need any help, little 
Khan. You did everything right!"

1078
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:11,840
"Right? You mean I got a right beating!"

1079
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:17,360
"You could have killed him. But you didn't."

1080
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:27,040
Timucin thinks of the sword he held in his hand, 
thinks of the short but intense temptation;  

1081
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:34,880
the power it exercised for a brief moment 
sends a shiver down his spine. Perhaps this  

1082
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:43,200
is the first time he has realised just how 
thin the boundary is between life and death.

1083
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:51,920
"It was right," repeats Sarantuya heavily, 
"because a few scratches and cuts will heal,  

1084
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:56,080
but you cannot give back a life you have taken.  

1085
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:03,200
And sometimes the person who has taken 
it becomes the person who is pursued."

1086
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:11,920
"Is this supposed to be the Wisdom of the 
Dragons or something?" he asks angrily.

1087
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:19,920
"No," answers Sarantuya, "just 
my experience after a long life.  

1088
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:28,320
Nothing would have happened if you had killed 
that boy, because you are the son of the khan,  

1089
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:35,840
and he challenged you; but you may 
have never forgotten him. Ever."

1090
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:39,520
"And what if I had forgotten him?"

1091
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:51,360
"That would only have been worse," says 
Sarantuya mysteriously, "because sometimes  

1092
02:15:51,360 --> 02:16:00,320
it is only a tiny step that puts a life 
onto the wrong path. But you did right."

1093
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:06,480
Timucin is not in the mood for another round  

1094
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:13,600
of dragon wisdom. Not that Sarantuya 
is not in the right; he knows she is.

1095
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,520
"Yes, well... whatever the case, I 
learned something important today."

1096
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:22,240
"What did you learn?"

1097
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:27,120
"That it might be nice to have 
friends, but that's all there is.  

1098
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:31,840
When it comes down to it, you're on your own."

1099
02:16:32,399 --> 02:16:35,679
Sarantuya looks at him silently for a while,  

1100
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:43,760
and in such a strange way, that Timucin feels more 
and more uncomfortable. He only said what he just  

1101
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:51,520
said to annoy her slightly, but he realizes he 
has really hurt her. He did not mean to do that.

1102
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,840
"I meant Chuzir," he claims.

1103
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,560
"No," says Sarantuya, "no, you didn't."

1104
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:05,040
Timucin is silent.

1105
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:11,120
"I understand," says Sarantuya, sighing.

1106
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:13,840
"What?"

1107
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:20,320
Instead of answering his question, 
Sarantuya just stares straight past him,  

1108
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:27,840
as if the answer is somewhere out there 
in the grey twilight surrounding them.

1109
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:38,800
"There is something you should know, little Khan," 
she says after a long while, "I did not finish my  

1110
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:46,080
story last night. I know that you beseeched 
me to help, but I chose not to hear you."

1111
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:48,000
"Why?"

1112
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,600
"I have not yet told you why so few of us  

1113
02:17:54,319 --> 02:17:59,679
chose to befriend your tribes- 
people and make you into companions."

1114
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:09,600
"Companions? It sounds like we're married!" 
He tries to laugh, but his joke does not have  

1115
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:14,241
any effect on Sarantuya, who 
stares at him with a serious look.

1116
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:25,680
"Well, we do marry you, in a way," she answers, 
"because we enter into an eternal bond with you.  

1117
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:34,960
If we choose to bind ourselves to one of you, 
then we stay with you for life. Unless, that is,  

1118
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:43,520
you take the wrong path; even then, we have 
to grant you a last wish, whatever it may be."  

1119
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:50,160
"Whatever it may be?" says Timucin, making sure.  

1120
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:57,359
"You mean, I can wish for whatever I want 
and I'll get it? Whatever it may be?"

1121
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:09,359
"Whatever it may be," repeats the dragon. She 
sounds sad. "Be careful what you wish for, though.  

1122
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:19,840
You would never see me again, and you 
might have to pay a terrible price."

1123
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:27,680
What she says scares Timucin, and he is 
quite sure that she means to do so, too.  

1124
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:34,720
Suddenly, however, Sarantuya bares 
her teeth in a wide dragon-smile.

1125
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:45,840
"Well, enough Wisdom of the Dragons for one 
night?" she asks cheer-fully. Timucin is serious,  

1126
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:54,640
however; he is still scared, and Sarantuya's 
fake joviality just makes it worse. He can  

1127
02:19:54,640 --> 02:20:01,840
tell that she is hiding something behind it, and 
he can sense that he does not want to know it.

1128
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:09,201
"You haven't told me why you only reveal 
yourselves to so few people," he says.

1129
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:17,920
"We have been responsible for too much 
bad in the world," answers the dragon,  

1130
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:27,040
"because you humans are clever. You're all 
incredibly stupid, but very clever too.  

1131
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:35,120
After a while, too many people knew about 
the last wish, and we had to grant them.  

1132
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:46,800
The temptation of unlimited power is great, any 
only very few can withstand it. Your world and  

1133
02:20:46,800 --> 02:21:04,080
your tribe have experienced boundless suffering, 
wars and terrors and death, and we presents. So  

1134
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:12,880
most of us have chosen to avoid people, and 
only very few of us seek human companions."

1135
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:19,920
"But you did," says Timucin. "Why?"

1136
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:29,360
"Because I saw that you have real greatness 
inside you, Timucin," she replies.  

1137
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:39,840
"Do not disappoint me, little Khan; the 
consequences for your people would be grave."

1138
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,600
CHAPTER NINE

1139
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:44,320
Friendship

1140
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:54,720
Belmin and his entourage stay for ten days. 
As befits his rank and position as a great  

1141
02:21:54,720 --> 02:22:02,720
khan and brother in oath to Timucin's father, a 
feast is given every evening in Belmin's honour.  

1142
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:11,600
The fire in his father's tent often burns so 
long that its last light mingles with the first  

1143
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:20,640
rays of the rising sun. Arbesa and Timucin spend 
every night in his yurt, and although she then  

1144
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:28,080
passes most of the day avoiding him, either busy 
doing something or chatting with the other women,  

1145
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:34,880
they become a lot closer to each other in this 
time. They haven't touched each other at all,  

1146
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:41,840
the fleeting kiss as he lay on the ground 
that first morning remains their only kiss.  

1147
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:50,480
She even seems afraid of any other contact, 
although she does not seem to be prudish.  

1148
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,880
Something happens between them, however.  

1149
02:22:55,920 --> 02:23:05,200
Timucin is not sure whether it is friendship 
or love, but he feels good when she is there.  

1150
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:13,359
After a while, he misses the continual 
nagging and frequently unfriendly scorn  

1151
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:20,880
when she is not there. At first, what Belmin 
said about him spending a year in his village  

1152
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:27,919
frightened him - Timucin has never been away 
from his home for more than a couple of days  

1153
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:36,319
at a time - but now he is more afraid of not 
seeing Arbesa for more than a day. Not only  

1154
02:23:36,319 --> 02:23:41,280
does he now know that he will have to spend 
the rest of the summer and the winter to come  

1155
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:47,759
in the Voshon village, but he is actually looking 
forward to being there together with Arbesa.

1156
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:56,080
And so it comes to the last day. 
Arbesa is already gone when he wakes up  

1157
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:04,240
(Timucin has not yet found out how she always 
manages to get up before him, even when he tries  

1158
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:11,280
to get up earlier), so Timucin leaves the yurt 
and runs to the river to wash without his armour  

1159
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:17,200
hoping to find her there. 
Instead, he finds Chuzir there.

1160
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:26,399
His brother in oath is sitting on a rock on 
the riverbank, his bare feet dangling in the  

1161
02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:33,599
water. Timucin does not need to ask him to know 
that he has been waiting for him for some time.  

1162
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:42,400
He wants to say something, but it is like 
his throat has been sewn shut again. Chuzir  

1163
02:24:42,399 --> 02:24:47,599
has avoided him over the last few 
days with the same success as Arbesa.

1164
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:56,160
Finally, however, Chuzir says something 
to break the uncomfortable silence.

1165
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:00,720
"Hello," he says, without 
turning round or even looking up.

1166
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:11,200
"Hello," replies Timucin, just as curtly. He 
has not admitted it to himself, but he has  

1167
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:17,120
greatly desired to see his brother in oath 
one more time before leaving the village.  

1168
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:25,440
Now that he sees him, though, he does not 
know what to say. He wants to slap himself  

1169
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:31,200
until the words he has so carefully considered 
over the last days come out, but they don't.

1170
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:39,359
"Today is the big day," says Chuzir after 
the silence threatens to become too heavy.  

1171
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:46,880
He is still looking away from Timucin with his 
feet in the water and has something lying on his  

1172
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:55,440
thighs that Timucin cannot see. Timucin wants to 
step closer, but for some reason feels, he cannot.

1173
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:58,800
"Yes," he answers.

1174
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:03,840
"They are already saddling up 
the horses," continues Chuzir.  

1175
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:12,479
To be exact, they had already started saddling 
them yesterday evening, and both of them know it.

1176
02:26:14,399 --> 02:26:18,160
"We are starting off early. It is a long ride."

1177
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:27,280
"Yes, long indeed. You won't be 
back until next spring, if at all."

1178
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:34,480
"What do you mean?" asks Timucin. "I will 
come back, of course I will come back."

1179
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,800
"And what if the girl does 
not want to?" asks Chuzir.

1180
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:46,719
"The girl" he replies, a little strongly in tone,  

1181
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:52,320
"is my betrothed. I shall return 
with her before the year is out."

1182
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:56,480
"Unless she does not want to leave her people  

1183
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:02,719
and persuades you to stay," says Chuzir. 
"Women are good at that sort of thing."

1184
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:08,319
"Nonsense!" replies Timucin. "My 
father would never allow it."  

1185
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:15,839
Chuzir stares at the river for a 
while. The starlight is dancing on it.  

1186
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:26,720
"Yes," he sighs, "you are right. He would never 
let that happen." His voice is full of bitterness,  

1187
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:35,200
and at first Timucin does not understand 
it. Then he sucks air through his teeth.

1188
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:44,319
"I do not believe it! You are jealous of Arbesa!"

1189
02:27:44,319 --> 02:27:52,479
"Rubbish!" replies Chuzir flatly. "It's just 
that..." He needs a moment to find the right  

1190
02:27:52,479 --> 02:28:01,839
words, and keeps looking at the river. "It's just 
that I don't want to lose you. We are friends."

1191
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:11,840
Timucin is as relieved as he is confused by 
this statement. In fact, he is so confused  

1192
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,081
that he is slightly angry.

1193
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,680
"I shall return before a year 
is out," he replies sharply,  

1194
02:28:20,479 --> 02:28:29,359
"and we are more than friends: we are brothers 
in oath." Well, I hope we still are, he adds  

1195
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:37,200
in his thoughts. On this, Chuzir turns round to 
face him and says something that scares Timucin.

1196
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:39,840
"Are we still brothers in oath?"

1197
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,920
"What do you mean?" responds Timucin roughly.

1198
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:50,400
Chuzir takes his feet out of the 
water and turns slowly towards him  

1199
02:28:50,399 --> 02:28:56,719
until Timucin can see what he 
has in his lap. His eyes widen.

1200
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:02,639
"I've been waiting for you because 
I wanted to speak to you alone  

1201
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:09,840
and to give you this, if you want it 
back." He holds up the arrow to Timucin.

1202
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:17,360
"Have you lost your mind?" gasps Timucin. 
"We swore our oath on this arrow."

1203
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:26,800
"I am not worthy of it," replies 
Chuzir quietly. "I betrayed you  

1204
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:35,840
and did not stand by you when you needed my help. 
I would understand if you want to undo our oath."

1205
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:44,161
For a moment, Timucin wants to grab the arrow 
out of his hands - not to break it and so to undo  

1206
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:50,720
this oath made for all eternity - but to 
slap Chuzir in the face for being so stupid.

1207
02:29:52,399 --> 02:29:59,920
"You have gone mad," he says. "I will go mad with 
anger if you do not put away this arrow right now.  

1208
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:02,080
How did you betray me?"

1209
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:06,319
"I should not have told the 
others about your fear of dogs."

1210
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:12,081
"That is true," says Timucin, 
"so you owe me one, then?"  

1211
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:23,839
He grins. Chuzir looks up at him uncertainly. His 
hand, in which the arrow is resting, is trembling  

1212
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:34,639
ever so slightly, but a faint glimmer of hope 
comes into his eyes. It is still quite dark,  

1213
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:43,280
so Timucin cannot be sure, but he thinks 
he sees tears glinting in the starlight.

1214
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:50,880
"And there was no point trying to help 
against Ilhan," he says, grinning even wider,  

1215
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:56,720
"because I had a great bodyguard... and 
if you say any more stupid things about  

1216
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:00,080
our friendship being over, I'll set her on you!"

1217
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:07,439
"So you forgive me, then?" asks Chuzir shyly.

1218
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:12,081
"There is nothing to forgive," 
says Timucin fiercely.  

1219
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:20,080
Then he takes the arrow out of Chuzir's hand 
and lays it carefully on the ground. Chuzir  

1220
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:28,319
looks closely at Timucin, as if he is looking 
for traces of malice or a grudge in his face.

1221
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:31,599
"And what about Ilhan and the others?" he asks.

1222
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:37,200
"You keep an eye on them for me 
until I return," replies Timucin,  

1223
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:41,840
mock strict and winking conspiratorially.

1224
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:56,080
"Can you keep a secret?" he asks Chuzir, who nods. 
"When I come back with Arbesa, we won't be alone."

1225
02:31:56,080 --> 02:32:00,399
"What do you mean?" asks Chuzir, wide-eyed.

1226
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:07,840
"I've already spoken with Arbesa's father, and 
he is going to help me," continues Timucin.  

1227
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:14,160
Chuzir's eyes get even wider and his jaw drops.

1228
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:21,680
"There are lots of puppies in his village and he 
has promised to give me one that I can raise,"  

1229
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:28,800
says Timucin. "When I come back, I will have 
the biggest, wildest dog you can imagine!"

1230
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:37,840
Chuzir looks at him in surprise for a moment 
longer, then he starts to laugh loudly.  

1231
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:46,560
Finally, they hug and return hand in hand to the 
village. The others are already waiting for them;  

1232
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:51,839
a few moments later, Timucin 
leaves the village.
 
 
 

1233
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:56,080
CHAPTER TEN

1234
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:58,160
Bajar and Batu

1235
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:08,800
Almost nine months later to the day, Timucin 
returns, just as he has promised his brother in  

1236
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:16,880
oath he will. This time, there is no huge baggage 
train approaching the dozen yurts of his home  

1237
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:26,240
village, nestling next to the hill on the banks 
of the Omon; it is just he, Arbesa and their two  

1238
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:35,519
loyal bodyguards. Despite his tribe's peaceful 
nature and the fact that there are no animosities  

1239
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:42,640
with any of the neighboring tribes, Arbesa's 
father insists on these two accompanying the  

1240
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:54,080
couple. Two further bodyguards are present, too 
- Bajar and Batu, the two huge black dogs that  

1241
02:33:54,080 --> 02:34:02,160
Timucin has raised in the preceding months 
and which follow him everywhere he goes.

1242
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:04,960
Their arrival does not go unnoticed.  

1243
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:13,040
Timucin's sharp eyes and ears tell him that they 
are being followed by lookouts, but they have  

1244
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:19,680
not come with bad intentions. They are just 
watching them, not planning to ambush them.

1245
02:34:21,359 --> 02:34:26,880
When they are about two arrow-flights away 
from the village, a small troop of riders  

1246
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:36,160
approaches them. Timucin sees from a long way 
off that his father is not one of them. He is  

1247
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:44,000
a little disappointed, but not too badly, and the 
feeling goes as quickly as it has come. After all,  

1248
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:51,840
they saw each other but ten days ago. As is custom 
in the two tribes, his father visited the father  

1249
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:57,840
of the bride at the end of the engagement period 
to discuss the final details of the wedding.  

1250
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:05,040
Then he returned earlier in order to prepare 
the great feast in Timucin's village.  

1251
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:12,719
Belmin and the great men of his tribe are 
to arrive later, at which time Timucin and  

1252
02:35:12,720 --> 02:35:18,480
Arbesa will marry and the bond between 
the two tribes will become official.

1253
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:28,399
Timucin is looking forward to this day. In the 
months past, they have not been apart for a single  

1254
02:35:28,399 --> 02:35:37,280
day, and he now knows Arbesa as well as anyone 
can know another person. Yet it will be different  

1255
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:43,759
once they are married, the only son 
and the only daughter of two khans.

1256
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:52,081
Timucin has learned a lot from Arbesa and her 
people, and perhaps Arbesa has learnt the odd  

1257
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:59,519
thing from him. Although they have never said it, 
they both know how their future together will be.  

1258
02:36:00,479 --> 02:36:07,919
After many years, hopefully very many years, 
Belmin and Tamer will be called to the gods,  

1259
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:14,319
and then they will unite their two tribes 
and make a new and more powerful one,  

1260
02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:21,679
one which is not ruled by a man of the sword, 
but by a man of wisdom. It will be a tribe of  

1261
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:27,360
prosperous farmers and artisans, 
not of warriors and pillagers.

1262
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:31,600
But this is a long way in the future.

1263
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:38,559
Arbesa steers her pony closer to Timucin's 
horse and points to the riders approaching.

1264
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,479
"Your father is not coming to welcome us?"

1265
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:49,600
"He is the khan and a very busy man," 
answers Timucin with a touch of mockery,  

1266
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:51,760
"and we are only children."

1267
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:58,319
"Yes, and your mother will probably tear 
his head off if he doesn't bring you home  

1268
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:03,840
as quickly as possible. I certainly would, 
if I had not seen my only son for so long."

1269
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:13,200
"Yes, well," sighs Timucin, "my mother is an 
obedient woman and knows to respect her husband."

1270
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:23,200
"Then maybe you should marry her," says Arbesa 
with a straight face. Timucin is about to reply  

1271
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:30,880
with a jokey answer, but now he sees the 
riders come closer and recognizes Chuzir. He  

1272
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:38,319
shouts out his name and dashes off towards him. 
The two dogs follow him, barking excitedly.  

1273
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:46,720
Arbesa falls back, although Timucin knows that 
she could ride just as fast if she wanted.  

1274
02:37:48,240 --> 02:37:54,479
The three riders also increase their speed, 
and Chuzir waves at Timucin, who sees that  

1275
02:37:54,479 --> 02:38:01,839
his brother in oath has his bow on the saddle 
and the arrow in his quiver - just their arrow.  

1276
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:10,000
His two companions hold their horses back as 
they draw nearer, so that only Timucin and  

1277
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:16,800
Chuzir are approaching one another, like 
two knights dueling. Indeed it seems that  

1278
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:22,880
neither wants to be the one to stop, and it is 
only at the last minute that both of them tear  

1279
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:29,440
their horses out of the gallop and pass by each 
other closely enough for Timucin's left knee  

1280
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:37,359
to touch Chuzir's. He yanks so hard at 
the bridle that the horse neighs angrily  

1281
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:45,519
and stands on its hind legs, turning round 
instantly. Chuzir does exactly the same.

1282
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:54,240
They approach each other like two 
warriors, but embrace as friends, bending  

1283
02:38:54,240 --> 02:39:01,840
in their saddles. Timucin almost falls from 
his, due to the force of Chuzir's embrace.  

1284
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:09,040
His two dogs run around yapping and growling, 
but seem to have understood that this was not  

1285
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:17,200
meant to be a fight and wag their tails. For 
a while, the two friends just laugh happily,  

1286
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:22,160
pat each other on the shoulder, or 
prod and poke one another until Timucin  

1287
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:29,439
notices that their friendly exchange of blows 
threatens to become less friendly, and stops.

1288
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:37,839
"And so this is how you greet your 
future khan?" he asks, laughing.

1289
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:42,640
"No, this is how I greet an old friend! An old  

1290
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:45,520
friend who can still ride 
a horse as well as ever!"

1291
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:50,400
"I let you off lightly," replies 
Timucin. "It wouldn't have been  

1292
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:54,000
fair to put you to shame after we 
haven't seen each other for so long!"

1293
02:39:55,120 --> 02:40:00,240
Chuzir's horse starts to get restless 
and he has to calm it back down.  

1294
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:09,760
Timucin uses the time to have a good look at his 
old friend. He has not been away for a full year,  

1295
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:13,200
and yet his friend seems to have grown up a lot.  

1296
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:20,880
His shoulders have got broader, he is quite a 
bit taller and he is also far more muscular.  

1297
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:30,080
Then he sees that he too must look different to 
Chuzir; even he himself has noticed changes in  

1298
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:38,000
recent months. He too has grown - a lot more than 
Chuzir - and his shoulders too are broader. He is  

1299
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:46,000
far better built than he was, and his voice has 
become a lot deeper. That is almost certainly due  

1300
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:55,760
to the way he has been living. Belmin's tribe is 
not just peaceful, but very wealthy. They eat well  

1301
02:40:55,760 --> 02:41:02,320
every day, their yurts are never cold, 
and he has learnt to eat other things than  

1302
02:41:02,319 --> 02:41:09,200
lamb and mutton that he would never have tried 
before - even if he was reluctant at first.  

1303
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:17,279
And once he got used to them, these new foodstuffs 
not only tasted good, but did him good, too.

1304
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:28,399
That is only one reason behind the change, though, 
another being Arbesa, in whose presence he really  

1305
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:36,719
comes into his own. The third, and perhaps most 
important thing, is something that he cannot put  

1306
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:47,040
his finger on, something that cannot be described. 
It is the peaceful life of the Voshon, a life free  

1307
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:57,840
of fear and fighting and war and blood. It soothes 
his soul, and affects his body in a good way.

1308
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:07,440
In just a few days, you will be a married 
man, a silent voice says, teasing him,  

1309
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:17,279
but don't overdo it. Enjoy the time that you are 
still a boy. Later, you will wish you still were!

1310
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:26,960
He is about to turn in his saddle and give 
Arbesa a look, he is used to her little speeches,  

1311
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:34,000
but he has asked her to leave off a little for the 
first few months. It has taken him some time to  

1312
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:40,319
realise that her apparently rude way of talking 
to him is her manner of showing her affection,  

1313
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:48,560
and he knows that his friends and people in the 
tribe will not understand this straight away. He  

1314
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:55,840
suddenly realizes that the voice is Sarantuya's, 
though. Recently, the dragon has started talking  

1315
02:42:55,840 --> 02:43:04,560
to him more often during daylight hours as well as 
in his dreams. And her voice seems to be getting  

1316
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:12,720
more and more similar to Arbesa's. Well, 
it is becoming as sarcastic in any case.

1317
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:25,360
Behind him, he hears a high-pitched and mildly 
scornful laugh and, as Chuzir gets his horse back  

1318
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:33,920
under control and looks up, he is looking directly 
at Arbesa's face. Unlike for her first visit,  

1319
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:43,200
Arbesa has not worn a veil, and Timucin is visibly 
amused by the effect Arbesa's face has on Chuzir.  

1320
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:50,399
He is looking at somebody he has last 
seen as a girl, and who is now a woman.

1321
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:58,240
"Don't believe a word this silly boy says," 
jokes Arbesa, "my father found the most  

1322
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:03,840
peaceful horse in the whole tribe; otherwise, 
he probably wouldn't have made it here!"

1323
02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:13,041
So Arbesa is clearly not going to play 
the obedient wife, not even on her first  

1324
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:22,960
day. Timucin sighs silently to himself and 
hears a silent laugh behind his forehead.

1325
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:30,320
Chuzir laughs and, for a moment, 
Timucin has the impression that a shadow  

1326
02:44:30,319 --> 02:44:38,319
has come over his face. It disappears again very 
quickly and he is not sure it really was there.

1327
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:44,480
"Arbesa," replies Chuzir, "I 
am pleased to see you again."

1328
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:52,080
Arbesa replies pleasantly and then she 
and Chuzir exchange polite greetings.  

1329
02:44:52,960 --> 02:45:00,480
Arbesa starts to tease him too just like she does 
Timucin, who uses this time to size up the rest  

1330
02:45:00,479 --> 02:45:07,599
of the group. He is overjoyed to see his arrow 
in Chuzir's quiver; perhaps Chuzir took it with  

1331
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:14,720
him deliberately, and Timucin is angry at himself 
for not having thought of taking his oath-arrow,  

1332
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:22,720
too. Yet Chuzir is bound to understand this. In 
any case, if the look in his eyes is anything  

1333
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:29,280
to go by, he is too happy to see Timucin 
to think about little details like that.

1334
02:45:30,479 --> 02:45:38,559
He tears his gaze away from Chuzir and looks 
at the other two riders, who have stayed back  

1335
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:47,760
at a respectful distance. He is surprised to see 
that one of them is Ilhan, and is not sure whether  

1336
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:55,840
this is a good or a bad thing. In contrast to 
Chuzir, he does not seem to have changed at all  

1337
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:03,040
and still looks how Timucin remembers 
him: a thin, tall fellow with a mean face  

1338
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:10,880
and malicious eyes. The only difference, 
however, is that he is looking at Timucin  

1339
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:17,520
with respect; no trace of friendliness 
at all, but respect nonetheless.  

1340
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:26,399
The other rider with him was also at the riverbank 
that day, and he is not looking at Timucin at all,  

1341
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:35,920
but is staring wide-eyed at his two huge dogs. 
They are weaving in and out of the horses' legs,  

1342
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:41,680
wagging their tails when they look 
up at Timucin, Arbesa and Chuzir and  

1343
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:47,760
growling and baring their tremendous teeth 
when they look at Ilhan and the other boy.  

1344
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:54,720
Timucin briefly grins, but does not 
think any further about what he might do;  

1345
02:46:55,359 --> 02:47:00,960
he will have plenty of time to pay them back 
for what they did. For the moment, there are  

1346
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:11,120
more important things to do. And do you really 
need to pay them back? adds Sarantuya silently.

1347
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:14,720
No, not really.

1348
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:20,480
Timucin decides that Chuzir has spent enough time  

1349
02:47:20,479 --> 02:47:24,080
suffering his future wife's 
cheerful teasing - for now,  

1350
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:30,240
at least - and pushes his horse in between their 
steeds, pretending to be strict with his friend.

1351
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:36,399
"If I did not know better," he growls, "I 
should think you were courting my future wife!  

1352
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:39,840
But you would never do a 
thing like that, would you?"

1353
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:48,480
"Never!" says Chuzir, making an injured 
face and adding with a loud whisper: "Well,  

1354
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,880
not when you are around!"

1355
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:58,960
Arbesa - and Sarantuya too - find 
this funny and laugh; Chuzir too  

1356
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:06,000
starts to laugh out loud, and Timucin pretends 
to be even stricter and turns to the two riders.

1357
02:48:06,960 --> 02:48:13,760
"Accompany my bride to the village. I have some 
business to take care of with this utter rogue  

1358
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:20,480
here!" He follows this little joke with 
a fully overdone commanding gesture.  

1359
02:48:21,359 --> 02:48:26,799
Chuzir grins at him, but the other two 
immediately start off on their horses  

1360
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:33,840
and try to flank Arbesa's pony. Ilhan 
makes an almost ridiculously low bow.

1361
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:36,960
"As you wish, my Khan."

1362
02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:46,560
Timucin frowns. They must have said 
that to make fun of him. Yet they  

1363
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:52,560
are frightfully respectful about it; in 
fact, they seem almost afraid of him.  

1364
02:48:53,600 --> 02:49:00,640
The second boy still will not look 
at him. Something is not right here.

1365
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:09,840
He remains silent, however, until Arbesa and her 
bodyguards - all four of them - have started for  

1366
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:17,120
the village and are a good distance away. 
Then he turns in his saddle to Chuzir and,  

1367
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:20,640
with a puzzled expression, asks him something.

1368
02:49:22,479 --> 02:49:26,879
"What did you do to them to make them 
so friendly to me all of a sudden?"

1369
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:36,479
Chuzir does not answer. The elation of the 
morning melts away with the first rays of the sun.  

1370
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:42,640
Timucin repeats the question, now very seriously.

1371
02:49:44,399 --> 02:49:50,000
"What is going on here, Chuzir. 
Why is he calling me... khan?"

1372
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:54,719
Chuzir avoids his gaze,  

1373
02:49:55,439 --> 02:50:03,599
lets three, maybe four heartbeats go by 
that seem like an eternity, and then speaks.

1374
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:08,559
"Because you are khan, Timucin."

1375
02:50:10,880 --> 02:50:18,240
"What do you mean?" Timucin's voice sounds 
more frightened than he actually is;  

1376
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:26,240
he does not really understand what Chuzir's answer 
means. Or maybe he does not want to understand it.  

1377
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:33,279
His thoughts are suddenly more tense than 
ever, and the tension is not coming from him.  

1378
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:43,040
Something else is inside him, listening, 
terrified, and scared of what is to come.

1379
02:50:45,439 --> 02:50:52,559
"Where is my father?" asks Timucin once 
he realizes that Chuzir will not answer  

1380
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:57,360
of his own accord. His brother in 
oath is still avoiding his gaze.

1381
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:04,320
"He is not here," Chuzir says then.

1382
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:12,479
"Not here?!" Timucin sits up in his saddle, 
straight as an arrow. "What do you mean?  

1383
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:15,920
He rode out before us just ten days ago."

1384
02:51:16,479 --> 02:51:22,719
"I know," interrupts Chuzir, turning slowly 
in his saddle to face his brother in oath.  

1385
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:26,480
Timucin can see how difficult this is for him.

1386
02:51:28,399 --> 02:51:33,279
"He did not arrive, Timucin. I'm sorry."

1387
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:45,840
"Not arrived? What's that supposed to mean? Do 
not talk to me in riddles, Chuzir! What happened?"

1388
02:51:46,399 --> 02:51:56,639
"The Tatars," answers Chuzir. An icy hand takes 
hold of Timucin's heart and seems to crush it,  

1389
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:07,519
slowly but mercilessly. He tries to say something, 
but cannot speak a word. He is horrified.

1390
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:17,839
"The Tatars?" he whispers back, after 
a while. "But... why? I mean... how?"  

1391
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:24,639
Chuzir holds his gaze, but it costs him strength.

1392
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,640
His voice trembles as he talks.

1393
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:37,760
"We don't know exactly how. He has been taken 
prisoner; that is all they have told us."

1394
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:43,600
"But he is alive?" asks Timucin.

1395
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:52,000
Chuzir hesitates too long for his answer to 
sound as convincing as Timucin would like.

1396
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:58,640
"Probably," he says after 
some time. He tries a laugh.

1397
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:05,760
"You know what cowards they are; they are 
hoping that we will pay a great ransom,  

1398
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:11,040
and as long as they think that we will give them 
gold and livestock, they will not touch him."

1399
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:21,680
Timucin stares at him. A feeling of 
strange, crippling pain starts to spread  

1400
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:32,880
inside him. His father? Prisoner? That is 
impossible! And it is not... right, either!  

1401
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:39,439
Suddenly, it is as if he 
is waking up from a dream,  

1402
02:53:40,240 --> 02:53:46,800
a dream that has been long and sweet, a 
dream in which the world was peaceful.  

1403
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:54,080
It is too beautiful to be true, and 
his awakening is all the more painful.

1404
02:53:56,080 --> 02:54:00,000
"Why did you not tell me? You 
should have sent a messenger!"

1405
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:09,040
"We only heard yesterday," answers Chuzir, 
not defensively, but quietly and sympathetic.

1406
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:17,600
"The elders came together and sent a messenger 
to the Tatars to ask about their conditions.  

1407
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:24,400
He has not yet returned - but this is 
no reason to worry", he adds hastily,  

1408
02:54:24,399 --> 02:54:34,080
almost frightened. "It is a long way to travel. 
He will be here at sundown at the very earliest."

1409
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:43,439
Timucin closes his eyes. The feeling of having 
left a beautiful dream for an equally horrible  

1410
02:54:43,439 --> 02:54:52,399
nightmare is still there. He is filled with 
cold horror, and with something else that he  

1411
02:54:52,399 --> 02:55:02,719
recoils from, something that he does not want to 
recognise. Something is stirring in his thoughts,  

1412
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:10,720
something big and powerful, whispering to 
him in an inaudible and comforting voice.  

1413
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:19,279
Yet he does not want to hear the words that are 
being spoken. He tries to think of his father,  

1414
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:25,920
but this makes him shiver. They spoke 
to each other just a few days ago,  

1415
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:33,359
yet the picture in his mind is of Tamer's face as 
it appeared to him that morning on the riverbank,  

1416
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:39,840
his face as he watched his 
only son being saved by a girl.

1417
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:51,920
Don't do it, little Khan, whispers the voice 
behind his forehead, don't let it happen.

1418
02:55:53,920 --> 02:56:00,880
Timucin ignores the voice. He opens his 
eyes and sits bolt upright in his saddle;  

1419
02:56:00,880 --> 02:56:04,319
his fingers grip the bridle so hard that it hurts.

1420
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:06,400
"We ride."
 
 
 

1421
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:10,000
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1422
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,840
The Khan

1423
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:22,241
It has grown very quiet in the great yurt. The 
air is stuffy from all the people and the fire,  

1424
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:28,479
and Timucin does not know whether it is 
his head or his throat that hurts more.  

1425
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:37,520
Something invisible seems to be in the 
tent, too. It is something without a body,  

1426
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:42,000
something that crackles and hovers between them.  

1427
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:52,399
It turns the silence between their words into 
something acrimonious and makes the small hairs  

1428
02:56:52,399 --> 02:57:02,799
on the back of the men's hands and necks stand 
on end. Timucin closes his eyes and refuses to  

1429
02:57:02,800 --> 02:57:10,720
understand the excited words directed at him 
by one of the men. Ilhan's father, who else?

1430
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:20,080
He is tired like he has never been 
tired before. It is as if he is carrying  

1431
02:57:20,080 --> 02:57:27,519
an invisible heavy burden on his shoulders, and 
his shoulders no longer feel as broad and strong  

1432
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:36,241
as he thought they had become just a few hours 
back. His mouth is dry from speaking for too long  

1433
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:46,240
and too loudly. His thoughts have been replaced by 
a chaotic emptiness behind his forehead that not  

1434
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:58,160
even Sarantuya's words can escape. Her whispering 
is different, almost unpleasant. Without realizing  

1435
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:06,720
that he is doing it, his hand is feeling around 
for something to hold onto. He feels lost.

1436
02:58:08,319 --> 02:58:18,719
A thinner, cooler hand that is somehow filled 
with wonderful warmth takes his and holds it.  

1437
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:29,760
As he opens his eyes, he is looking at Arbesa's 
beautiful face. It looks very serious, yet in  

1438
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:38,320
the depth of her eyes, those eyes into which he 
likes to dive, he can see a look of sorrow and  

1439
02:58:38,319 --> 02:58:47,759
endless empathy. It is not necessary for Arbesa 
to say anything to him, or even to smile at him.  

1440
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:56,161
He can just feel the strength that she is 
trying to give him, and is very thankful for it.

1441
02:58:58,720 --> 02:59:01,600
"We must decide now, Khan!"

1442
02:59:04,399 --> 02:59:12,399
Timucin turns to Ilhan's father with a tired 
movement and only notices as he is doing so  

1443
02:59:12,399 --> 02:59:18,639
that Ilhan's father is not saying these 
words for the first time, and that he has  

1444
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:27,600
said them louder and more strongly each time. 
He also notices that the confusion of shouts,  

1445
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:36,880
words and nervous movements is slowly dying 
down. He becomes uncomfortably aware that  

1446
02:59:36,880 --> 02:59:43,760
at least a dozen pairs of eyes are staring 
at him and listening to every word he says.  

1447
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:52,080
The two dogs, who have been sitting 
still as two statues hewn of black basalt  

1448
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:57,359
at his sides, listening and looking 
alertly, have begun to whimper.  

1449
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:06,880
He gestures with his left hand and they 
return to silence. Two or three of the  

1450
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:15,040
men who have perhaps come too close retire 
respectfully, their eyes filled with fear.

1451
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:24,559
He does not want this. He has returned 
from the happiest time of his life to date  

1452
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:30,161
to celebrate the happiest day, 
not to hold a war council,  

1453
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:37,840
and certainly not to get involved in this 
useless and dangerous struggle for power.

1454
03:00:38,399 --> 03:00:48,160
Yet it is precisely this, which he must do, 
he realizes sadly. Ilhan's father has never  

1455
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:56,319
been a friend of his father's, and does not like 
Timucin either. In fact, Timucin has always seen  

1456
03:00:56,319 --> 03:01:02,559
Ilhan's father as one of those who is most likely 
to challenge his father for his position as khan.

1457
03:01:04,319 --> 03:01:14,080
Do not let him provoke you, little Khan, whispers 
a voice in his thoughts. Sarantuya has not said  

1458
03:01:14,080 --> 03:01:20,800
much since he entered the camp and began this 
council, which has now been going on all day  

1459
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:29,200
and will certainly continue into the night, but 
Timucin has felt her presence the whole time. She  

1460
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:37,200
has listened attentively to every word that has 
been said - especially to the words, he has said.

1461
03:01:38,880 --> 03:01:45,680
It is as if he is afraid of what is 
to come, he is worried about what will  

1462
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:56,720
happen. He does not know what it is, but it 
frightens him. I know, he thinks silently.  

1463
03:01:58,479 --> 03:02:05,439
Arbesa looks at him briefly, a look that no 
one else notices, but which lets him know  

1464
03:02:05,439 --> 03:02:13,519
that his conversation with himself in his head 
has not escaped her notice. Perhaps she has  

1465
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:23,760
been listening. More probably, she too has been 
speaking with her own dragon. He speaks, loudly.

1466
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:28,400
"We must all of us keep a cool head.  

1467
03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:35,599
If we react too hastily, we may further 
endanger Tamer's life, rather than save it."

1468
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:46,000
The tall, thin warrior pulls a scornful face and 
grunts, which would have been enough to cost him  

1469
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:56,479
his head if Tamer were in Timucin's place. And 
in a way, it is as if he is in Timucin's place,  

1470
03:02:56,479 --> 03:03:04,240
despite the hours he has spent now being told by 
many of the warriors that he is the de facto khan,  

1471
03:03:04,240 --> 03:03:11,120
that this is de facto his yurt, that 
these are his warriors who have sworn  

1472
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:18,880
loyalty to the khan, even if he does not 
want to be it. It is a grotesque situation.  

1473
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:28,559
Yes, it is true that he has returned in order 
to move into this yurt, one day, to take his  

1474
03:03:28,560 --> 03:03:39,840
father's carved throne, one day, to become 
khan - one day. But not now. And not like this.

1475
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:47,279
The tense silence holds and, despite 
the fact that they have now had  

1476
03:03:47,279 --> 03:03:53,840
the same conversation perhaps a dozen 
times, Timucin starts to feel a change.  

1477
03:03:55,279 --> 03:04:05,120
The day is drawing to its close, and everyone 
here is exhausted. More than this, the men are  

1478
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:14,240
ready to hear a decision. He asks himself how 
many of them would openly rally to an opponent,  

1479
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:23,920
should one come forward to dispute his decision. 
Not many, whispers Sarantuya behind his forehead,  

1480
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:33,201
because most of them are loyal to you. But 
you must make the right decision nonetheless.

1481
03:04:34,880 --> 03:04:37,359
That has never happened before.  

1482
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:45,760
Timucin cannot remember Sarantuya ever having 
given him such a direct piece of advice before,  

1483
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:53,040
let alone telling him, what other people 
are thinking. She must be very worried.

1484
03:04:54,479 --> 03:05:01,279
He is too. If he could only know, 
which decision is the right one.  

1485
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:06,000
Yet it will become clear in just a few moments.

1486
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:15,520
"Timucin, you..." Ilhan's father stops himself 
mid-flow as he realizes that he has chosen the  

1487
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:22,400
wrong tone of voice and that several of 
the men are looking at him darkly, almost  

1488
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:31,680
threateningly. He strokes his chin with the back 
of his hand nervously and then continues, in  

1489
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:37,280
a changed tone, more respectful 
and yet non the less defiant.

1490
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:45,840
"My Khan, I do not wish to seem 
disrespectful, but do let me speak openly."

1491
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:49,279
"Go ahead," says Timucin.

1492
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:56,480
Ilhan's father remains silent for 
far longer than everyone expects;  

1493
03:05:56,479 --> 03:06:01,279
Ti mucin can see that he is 
considering every word carefully.

1494
03:06:02,479 --> 03:06:06,559
"I do not wish to offend you, Khan..."

1495
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:12,960
"Timucin," interrupts Timucin, "you are 
welcome to keep calling me Timucin."

1496
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:22,560
Is this the wrong decision? A flicker 
of triumph surges into the man's eyes.

1497
03:06:24,399 --> 03:06:32,240
"Timucin," nods the warrior, "you know your 
father better than anyone here, so I do not  

1498
03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:37,920
need to tell you how he would have reacted if 
you had been taken and he were standing here."

1499
03:06:40,399 --> 03:06:48,080
Timucin tries not to, but he can see his 
father's face again, the sorrow and contempt  

1500
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:51,760
as he sees his son being beaten on the riverbank.

1501
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:57,519
"Well, how would he have reacted?" asks Arbesa.

1502
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:07,040
The rage that surges into the eyes of the warrior 
cannot escape notice, yet Timucin is not able to  

1503
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:14,399
say if this is due to what Arbesa has said, or 
just due to the fact that she has dared to enter  

1504
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:21,759
the fray. Apart from her, there are only men in 
the yurt, and women are not allowed in the war  

1505
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:29,280
council. Yet Arbesa followed him into the tent as 
if it were the most natural thing in the world,  

1506
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:35,520
and he only now realizes that this 
must have felt like a slap in the face  

1507
03:07:35,520 --> 03:07:42,081
to many men like Ilhan's father. Yet it 
is too late to do anything about this now.

1508
03:07:43,600 --> 03:07:49,840
"Be quiet, child!" hisses the warrior. 
"When men are talking, women are..."

1509
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:54,960
"Arbesa," interrupts Timucin, 
not loudly but sharply,  

1510
03:07:55,680 --> 03:08:02,880
"is my bride and will soon be your ruler. You 
shall speak to her in a more respectful tone!"  

1511
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:13,040
The dogs growl in agreement and bare their 
teeth. Timucin does not hold them back this time.

1512
03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:22,319
The man stares at him, the smouldering rage 
in his eyes burning brighter, and Timucin sees  

1513
03:08:22,319 --> 03:08:29,120
that it is probably nothing more than the presence 
of his huge fighting dogs that is keeping Ilhan's  

1514
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:38,800
father from acting on his impulses. What if, 
thinks Timucin angrily, I were to just let  

1515
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:45,440
them loose and watch them do their job, which is 
to protect me and to tear my enemies to shreds?

1516
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:56,000
At this moment, however, Chuzir stands on the 
other side next to Arbesa and lets his hand  

1517
03:08:56,000 --> 03:09:06,720
fall loudly onto the handle of his sword, hanging 
in his belt. It is just a gesture, nothing more,  

1518
03:09:07,520 --> 03:09:15,920
yet it suffices to fill Timucin's 
heart with warmth and strength.

1519
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:22,800
"Our khan," answers Ilhan's father in a 
deliberate and carefully respectful tone,  

1520
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:31,040
"would have done what any true khan would 
do. He would have called his men to arms  

1521
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:35,280
and let these cowards have 
the answer they deserve."

1522
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:41,599
"And what would be this answer?" asks Timucin.

1523
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:46,080
"We must go and free our khan!"

1524
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:53,360
"Yet did you not yourself just 
call Timucin 'khan'?" asks Arbesa.  

1525
03:09:55,279 --> 03:10:02,479
Timucin does not say anything, but 
he sighs inside. She may be right,  

1526
03:10:02,479 --> 03:10:10,000
but she is walking on thin ice. "Who is your 
new khan, the man to whom you owe allegiance..."

1527
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,800
"As long as Timucin's father is not here,  

1528
03:10:13,359 --> 03:10:21,040
yes," answers the warrior, "and I shall 
obey him." He then turns to Timucin.

1529
03:10:22,399 --> 03:10:28,559
"We are talking about the life of your father 
here, my Khan. And the honour of our tribe.  

1530
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:34,400
Tamer will not be happy if he returns to 
find that we have behaved as cowards."

1531
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:38,400
The men in the yurt murmur in agreement,  

1532
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:46,479
and Timucin can almost feel the change in what 
they now expect him to decide. Whether he is  

1533
03:10:46,479 --> 03:10:54,639
a boy or not, Timucin has just been insulted 
by Ilhan's father, and he cannot accept that.

1534
03:10:56,080 --> 03:11:03,359
"It is no sign of cowardice to avoid a fight that 
one cannot win," he says, quoting his father.  

1535
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:12,399
"The Tatars are great in number and they will 
know that we are coming." He raises his hand  

1536
03:11:12,399 --> 03:11:18,879
to stop Ilhan's father contradicting him, and 
continues in a deliberately commanding tone.

1537
03:11:19,760 --> 03:11:27,280
"We all know how weak the Tatars are - 
they are no match for us and we could win  

1538
03:11:27,279 --> 03:11:33,200
against them. Yet they would kill 
my father. Is that what you want?"

1539
03:11:34,880 --> 03:11:40,640
Two or three of the men make frightened 
noises, and Timucin's opponent drops  

1540
03:11:40,640 --> 03:11:50,400
his hand to his sword, and then relaxes it. He 
speaks respectfully despite the fury inside him.

1541
03:11:51,920 --> 03:12:00,480
"No, of course not, my Khan," he 
whispers. "So what do you wish to do?"

1542
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:09,519
"I have decided," answers Timucin loudly and 
in a clear voice so that everyone may hear him,  

1543
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:17,040
"that we shall wait until the messenger 
returns whom you sent to the Tatars. We  

1544
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:23,840
shall hear their conditions. Should they demand 
a ransom, then we shall pay it if we are able."

1545
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:28,880
"And if we are not?" asks the warrior.

1546
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:35,120
"Then I shall go to them myself and 
negotiate his release personally,"  

1547
03:12:35,920 --> 03:12:45,200
replies Timucin. Not only Ilhan's father, but 
also Chuzir and many other warriors look at him,  

1548
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:53,679
astonished and almost incredulous; only 
the warmth in Arbesa's eyes seems to grow.

1549
03:12:55,120 --> 03:12:59,840
"Should I not return," he answers 
after a short, pregnant pause,  

1550
03:13:00,880 --> 03:13:03,279
"then you will have to decide what to do."

1551
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:09,920
"My Khan," shouts one of the men, his voice 
sounding more disbelieving than angry,  

1552
03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:12,320
"that will not help your father!"

1553
03:13:13,439 --> 03:13:16,319
"This is the coward's way!" adds another.

1554
03:13:17,120 --> 03:13:20,800
"We are warriors, not wenches 
who can be traded like pawns!"

1555
03:13:22,239 --> 03:13:29,439
There is a brief moment when it looks as 
if the mood may turn. Timucin can almost  

1556
03:13:29,439 --> 03:13:36,799
feel people rallying to Ilhan's father, and he 
can almost see his father's disapproving look.  

1557
03:13:39,279 --> 03:13:45,759
His father has not only seen his son 
beaten, but now how he is losing his tribe.  

1558
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:50,800
This has never happened for as 
long as there have been khans.

1559
03:13:52,720 --> 03:14:00,000
"Silence!" he shouts. Is he 
tricking himself, or can he hear  

1560
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:06,640
the roar of huge, invisible wings 
throwing their shadow over the men?

1561
03:14:08,399 --> 03:14:17,839
"I know what you are thinking; I too feel it. Yet 
there is no honour in spilling innocent blood when  

1562
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:25,840
there is another path to take. I am no more a 
coward than any of you, and if there is no other  

1563
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:33,600
choice, of course we shall take our weapons and 
free Tamer. Yet we shall try the way of the word,  

1564
03:14:34,160 --> 03:14:40,800
before we take that of the sword. I 
have decided so, and you shall obey me!"

1565
03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:47,840
The invisible wings spread further;  

1566
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:57,680
something is stirring in him, the power of the 
dragon that is part of him. It is the legacy  

1567
03:14:57,680 --> 03:15:03,280
of his father, which he now understands for 
the first time not to be the strength in his  

1568
03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:10,239
sword-arm nor the accuracy of his bow, but 
something different and far more important.

1569
03:15:12,239 --> 03:15:21,359
Once again, there is an unpleasant silence. 
Everyone stares at him, most of them disbelieving,  

1570
03:15:21,359 --> 03:15:31,839
astonished or angry, a few of them perhaps in 
agreement. Then Ilhan's father speaks quietly,  

1571
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:37,600
disdainfully, and looking at Arbesa 
out of the corner of his eyes.

1572
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:43,520
"Now we are ruled by women and children."

1573
03:15:46,080 --> 03:15:48,559
Timucin slaps him in the face.

1574
03:15:50,239 --> 03:15:57,519
It is absurd. The warrior is more than a 
head taller than him and ten times as strong,  

1575
03:15:58,239 --> 03:16:03,840
and a part of him knows that this is just 
the moment his opponent has been waiting for.  

1576
03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:11,200
Several men suck their teeth and others lower 
their hands to their swords and daggers.  

1577
03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:17,040
Ilhan's father takes a step back 
and begins to draw his sword.  

1578
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:25,040
Suddenly, a big black form growls, 
leaps and sinks its teeth into his arm.

1579
03:16:26,399 --> 03:16:29,839
The man screams, roaring as he falls back,  

1580
03:16:30,479 --> 03:16:36,879
and tries to use his other arm to hit the dog, 
but it is no use, as the second dog has taken  

1581
03:16:36,880 --> 03:16:46,560
his other hand. Deep in Timucin, the dragon 
stirs, stretches its claws and, for a moment,  

1582
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:56,160
Timucin is sure that the warrior can see her. He 
is sure that he can see into her eyes and can see  

1583
03:16:56,160 --> 03:17:03,519
something that shakes him to the depth of his 
soul and fills his heart with fear, a fear  

1584
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:13,680
so dark that it makes him forget the black beasts 
biting at his arms. Time seems to become slower  

1585
03:17:14,239 --> 03:17:26,239
as Timucin sees in fantastic clarity how one of 
the dogs lets his arm drop and goes for his neck.

1586
03:17:26,239 --> 03:17:36,479
He wants the dog to bite; for a moment, for 
a short terrible moment, he wants it to bite,  

1587
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:46,480
wants nothing more than to see his fighting dogs 
tear this man to pieces, this man who has dared to  

1588
03:17:46,479 --> 03:17:54,639
challenge him, the khan, the ruler of this tribe; 
this man who has dared to insult him and his  

1589
03:17:54,640 --> 03:18:02,720
bride. He can see his father again, the expression 
in his eyes as he watched his son's most shameful  

1590
03:18:02,720 --> 03:18:10,720
moment, and perhaps this is what he owes his 
father, what his father expects of him. Perhaps  

1591
03:18:10,720 --> 03:18:17,280
he should spill the blood of his enemy, let the 
entire tribe see his life be taken, see that the  

1592
03:18:17,279 --> 03:18:26,719
rule of the stronger is still law. It is in him, 
this power that is almost the power of a dragon,  

1593
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:37,520
an ancient power that seeks blood and triumph 
and knows no mercy. This is what Sarantuya means  

1594
03:18:37,520 --> 03:18:45,280
when she has talked about the paths he can 
take. He does not even have to do anything:  

1595
03:18:45,279 --> 03:18:55,519
he must only wait one more heartbeat and the fangs 
of his dogs will do it for him - he will be khan.

1596
03:18:57,439 --> 03:19:00,799
"No!" he shouts. "Heel!"

1597
03:19:03,279 --> 03:19:09,279
The dog's teeth close on the man with 
a noise that sounds like a bear- trap  

1598
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:18,080
snapping shut. Yet it is not his throat 
that the dog bites, but a patch of skin  

1599
03:19:18,080 --> 03:19:26,479
just under it. The second dog lets go of the 
man's bleeding arm and returns to Timucin.

1600
03:19:28,720 --> 03:19:39,840
"No," says Timucin, now more quietly, almost 
to himself. "No, that is not our path."

1601
03:19:42,399 --> 03:19:46,639
Once again, it is as if time has slowed.  

1602
03:19:48,080 --> 03:19:58,000
Countless eyes are staring at him. Many of the 
men are astounded, shocked, completely helpless.  

1603
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:06,880
Each one is waiting for him to draw his 
sword and finish it himself. Instead,  

1604
03:20:07,600 --> 03:20:17,201
Timucin does something that surprises himself 
more than anyone else. He stops the tempting, dark  

1605
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:27,840
whispering inside himself, drops his hand from 
his sword, and goes to the man to help him up.

1606
03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:38,479
Ilhan's father looks at him, confused and 
scared, yet he takes his hand and stands up,  

1607
03:20:38,479 --> 03:20:47,839
swaying on his feet. His eyes no longer burn with 
triumph and fury, but are a sea of uncertainty.  

1608
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:56,399
He stands there for a moment, looking down 
at Timucin, before picking up his sword.  

1609
03:20:58,160 --> 03:21:07,599
He returns it to his sheath, tired. He 
sinks his head and speaks with real respect.

1610
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:14,161
"Yes, my Khan, I shall obey you."

1611
03:21:16,880 --> 03:21:24,319
And one day, you will understand me, 
too, adds Timucin in his thoughts.  

1612
03:21:26,080 --> 03:21:36,720
He tries to smile at the man in his eyes, but the 
warrior avoids his gaze; he seems shocked. Perhaps  

1613
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:44,400
he understands before Timucin that it is this 
moment that has made the boy into the khan,  

1614
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:47,760
whether his father returns or not.

1615
03:21:50,720 --> 03:21:55,440
"You may go now!" he says to 
everyone loudly after a pause.  

1616
03:21:56,640 --> 03:22:00,480
"Keep watch for the messenger and 
tell me the instant he arrives.

1617
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:06,640
It has been a long day and 
we all need peace and rest."  

1618
03:22:08,399 --> 03:22:17,679
The sound of huge beating wings and sharp claws 
accompanies his every word, but he can feel  

1619
03:22:17,680 --> 03:22:28,320
the tension dropping at the same time. One 
after another, the men turn and go. Finally,  

1620
03:22:28,319 --> 03:22:36,160
Ilhan's father is almost alone with them. 
He looks at Timucin, then at Arbesa,  

1621
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:47,840
then again at Timucin and goes, leaving the couple 
to themselves. The dogs are at Timucin's side.

1622
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:56,239
Only Chuzir is left. He looks at 
Timucin in a way that makes him shiver.

1623
03:22:57,840 --> 03:22:59,360
"Thank you," says Timucin.

1624
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:03,279
"What for," asks Chuzir.  

1625
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:10,480
The sound of his voice frightens Timucin 
even more than the look in his eyes.

1626
03:23:12,239 --> 03:23:18,639
"For being on my side," he answers. "I do not 
know what would have happened without you."

1627
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:23,600
"You are my brother in oath," replies Chuzir.

1628
03:23:25,359 --> 03:23:33,040
This is not the answer that Timucin wants to 
hear, but he also feels how pointless it would be  

1629
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:41,439
to say another word. He nods silently, and 
Chuzir understands that he now wishes to be  

1630
03:23:41,439 --> 03:23:50,479
alone with Arbesa. He turns away obediently, 
but stops after a few paces and turns to them.

1631
03:23:52,239 --> 03:23:53,040
"Was he right?"

1632
03:23:54,640 --> 03:23:55,360
"About what?"

1633
03:23:56,560 --> 03:24:00,480
"That you have been too 
long with the other tribe,"  

1634
03:24:00,479 --> 03:24:07,679
says Chuzir. These words hurt Timucin 
deeply, but he does not show it.  

1635
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:16,240
Instead, he shakes his head and smiles as if 
Chuzir has said something silly, but forgivable.

1636
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:28,319
"No," he replies. Nothing more. Chuzir seems 
even more disappointed, but turns and leaves.

1637
03:24:30,399 --> 03:24:34,639
"That was incredibly brave of you," says Arbesa.

1638
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:43,120
"Was it? Or is he right?" Arbesa 
lays her hand softly on his shoulder.

1639
03:24:44,239 --> 03:24:46,880
"One day, he will understand you.  

1640
03:24:48,080 --> 03:24:54,880
He is your brother in oath and, more 
importantly, he is your friend. Give him time."  

1641
03:24:57,600 --> 03:25:03,840
Timucin is almost ashamed and is just able 
to stop himself from pushing away her hand.

1642
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:12,480
"I hope I am wrong, but I feel like I have 
destroyed what makes my people special."  

1643
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:17,120
Arbesa laughs strangely at this.

1644
03:25:18,479 --> 03:25:25,120
"You have only destroyed what makes 
them bad. They will understand you.  

1645
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:31,920
You will become a great khan, who 
rules not by the sword, but by wisdom."

1646
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:43,600
Yet is this really wisdom? Timucin takes a few 
steps back from her and Arbesa lets her hand  

1647
03:25:43,600 --> 03:25:50,161
drop. She is disappointed, yet 
her eyes still smile at him.

1648
03:25:52,239 --> 03:25:55,519
"You need time, too," she says.

1649
03:25:57,040 --> 03:26:04,080
"Your people are known for their peaceful 
nature," he answers, "which I admire and envy,  

1650
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:08,559
but my people are not like this, not like yours."

1651
03:26:10,800 --> 03:26:18,480
"Yet we too were once like you," replies Arbesa, 
"until the dragons showed us the right way.  

1652
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:24,960
Have you never asked yourselves how we were 
able to live in peace with our neighbours?  

1653
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:32,000
Why your father and mine are friends, 
despite the fact that Tamer has attacked  

1654
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:36,560
so many other tribes and robbed them of their 
women, their animals and their treasure?"  

1655
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:40,880
As he tries to answer, she talks further.

1656
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:48,081
"I know what you want to say: there is no honour 
in attacking a tribe of cowards," she says,  

1657
03:26:48,080 --> 03:26:56,080
quoting him in scornful tone, "but we are no more 
cowards than you. That is what you have felt,  

1658
03:26:56,080 --> 03:27:00,720
Timucin; it is the power of 
the dragons that protects us.  

1659
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:08,320
You have just learned something very 
important, my love, and I am happy for you."

1660
03:27:09,680 --> 03:27:15,040
"What have I learned?" asks Timucin. Arbesa  

1661
03:27:15,040 --> 03:27:21,680
does not answer, but the silent voice 
of Sarantuya answers him for her.  

1662
03:27:23,200 --> 03:27:30,559
If you had done what the men wanted and 
drawn your sword, you would have lost me.

1663
03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:41,279
Yet you won the fight for me, not I, answers 
Timucin silently. He did not just imagine the  

1664
03:27:41,279 --> 03:27:49,120
dragon's powerful force in his heart; he really 
has her power, her invincibility, just as much  

1665
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:57,439
as anyone else here, including Ilhan's father. 
Sarantuya bent the will of the men, not him.

1666
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:07,200
That is not true, answers the 
dragon. Her voice sounds as if she is  

1667
03:28:07,200 --> 03:28:18,239
slightly amused, but it is warm and proud, 
too. It was your power that they felt. You have  

1668
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:28,420
always had it. I only showed you how you can 
best use it, and I am proud of you, my Khan.
 
 
 
 

1669
03:28:28,421 --> 03:28:29,058
- THE END -
