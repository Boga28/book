1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,840
Patrol Cruiser "IP-T 247" circling out 
toward Pluto on leisurely inspection tour  

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,880
to visit the outpost miners there, was 
in no hurry at all as she loafed along.  

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Her six-man crew was taking it very easy, and 
easy meant two-man watches, and low speed,  

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,200
to watch for the instrument panel 
and attend ship into the bargain.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120
She was about thirty million miles off Pluto, 
just beginning to get in touch with some of the  

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,960
larger mining stations out there, when Buck 
Kendall's turn at the controls came along.  

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,800
Buck Kendall was one of life's little jokes. 
When Nature made him, she was absentminded.  

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,520
Buck stood six feet two in his stocking feet, 
with his usual slight stoop in operation.  

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,920
When he forgot, and stood up straight, 
he loomed about two inches higher.  

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,840
He had the body and muscles of a dock 
navvy, which Nature started out to make.  

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,360
Then she forgot and added something of the 
same stuff she put in Sir Francis Drake.  

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,640
Maybe that made Old Nature nervous, and she 
started adding different things. At any rate,  

13
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,880
Kendall, as finally turned out, had a brain that 
put him in the first rank of scientists—when  

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,240
he felt like it—the general constitution 
of an ostrich and a flair for gambling.

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,480
The present position was due to such a gamble. An 
IP man, a friend of his, had made the mistake of  

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:09,040
betting him a thousand dollars he wouldn't get 
beyond a Captain's bars in the Patrol. Kendall  

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,680
had liked the idea anyway, and adding a bit of 
a bet to it made it irresistible. So, being a  

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,800
very particular kind of a fool, the glorious kind 
which old Nature turns out now and then, he left a  

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,880
five million dollar estate on Long Island, Terra, 
that same evening, and joined up in the Patrol.  

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,560
The Sir Francis Drake strain had immediately come 
forth—and Kendall was having the time of his life.  

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,800
In a six-man cruiser, his real work in the 
Interplanetary Patrol had started. He was still in  

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,040
it—but it was his command now, and a blue circle 
on his left sleeve gave his lieutenant's rank.

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,640
Buck Kendall had immediately proceeded 
to enlist in his command the IP man  

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,680
who had made the mistaken bet, and 
Rad Cole was on duty with him now.  

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,080
Cole was the technician of the T-247. His 
rank as Technical Engineer was practically  

26
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,320
equivalent to Kendall's circle-rank, which 
made the two more comfortable together.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,600
Cole was listening carefully to the 
signals coming through from Pluto.  

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,000
"That," he decided, "sounds like Tad 
Nichols' fist. You can recognize that  

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,720
broken-down truck-horse trot of his on 
the key as far away as you can hear it."

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,920
"Is that what it is?" sighed Buck. "I thought it 
was static mushing him at first. What's he like?"

31
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,880
"Like all the other damn fools who come out two 
billion miles to scratch rock, as if there weren't  

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,200
enough already on the inner planets. He's got a 
rich platinum property. Sells ninety percent of  

33
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,920
his output to buy his power, and the other 
eleven percent for his clothes and food."

34
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,720
"He must be an efficient miner," suggested 
Kendall, "to maintain 101% production like that."

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,680
"No, but his bank account is. He's figured out 
that's the most economic level of production.  

36
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,680
If he produces less, he won't be able to pay 
for his heating power, and if he produces more,  

37
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,200
his operation power will burn 
up his bank account too fast."

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
"Hmmm—sensible way to figure. 
A man after my own heart.  

39
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
How does he plan to restock his bank account?"

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,160
"By mining on Mercury. He does it regularly—sort 
of a commuter. Out here his power bills eat it up.  

41
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,840
On Mercury he goes in for potassium, and sells the 
power he collects in cooling his dome, of course.  

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,680
He's a good miner, and the old 
fool can make money down there."  

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,760
Like any really skilled operator, Cole 
had been sending Morse messages while  

44
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,960
he talked. Now he sat quiet waiting for 
the reply, glancing at the chronometer.

45
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,920
"I take it he's not after money—just 
after fun," suggested Buck.

46
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,240
"Oh, no. He's after money," replied Cole 
gravely. "You ask him—he's going to make  

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,160
his eternal fortune yet by striking a real 
bed of jovium, and then he'll retire."

48
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,880
"Oh, one of that kind."

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,640
"They all are," Cole laughed. 
"Eternal hope, and the rest of it."  

50
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,080
He listened a moment and went on. "But old Nichols 
is a first-grade engineer. He wouldn't be able  

51
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,440
to remake that bankroll every time if he wasn't. 
You'll see his Dome out there on Pluto—it's always  

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,360
the best on the planet. Tip-top shape. And he's 
a bit of an experimenter too. Ah—he's with us."

53
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,760
Nichols' ragged signals were coming through—or 
pounding through. They were worse than usual,  

54
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,160
and at first Kendall and 
Cole couldn't make them out.  

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
Then finally they got them in bursts. The man 
was excited, and his bad key-work made it worse.  

56
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,960
"—Randing stopped. They got him I 
think. He said—th—ship as big—a—nsport.  

57
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:23,920
Said it wa—eaded my—ay. Neutrons—on 
instruments—he's coming over the horizon—it's  

58
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:35,360
huge—war ship I think—register—instru—neutrons—." 
Abruptly the signals were blanked out completely.

59
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Cole and Kendall sat frozen and stiff. Each 
looked at the other abruptly, then Kendall moved.  

60
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
From the receiver, he ripped out the recording 
coil, and instantly jammed it into the analyzer.  

61
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,160
He started it through once, then again, then 
again, at different tone settings, till he found  

62
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:05,200
a very shrill whine that seemed to clear up most 
of Nichols' bad key-work. "T-247—T-247—Emergency.  

63
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:15,840
Emergency. Randing reports the—over 
his horizon. Huge—ip—reign manufacture.  

64
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Almost spherical. Randing's stopped. They 
got him I think. He said the ship was as  

65
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,368
big as a transport. Said it was headed 
my way. Neutrons—ont—gister—instruments.  

66
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,760
I think—is h—he's coming over the horizon.  

67
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,560
It's huge, and a war ship I 
think—register—instruments—neutrons."

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,240
Kendall's finger stabbed out at a button. 
Instantly the noise of the other men,  

69
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,680
wakened abruptly by the mild shocks, came 
from behind. Kendall swung to the controls,  

70
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,520
and Cole raced back to the engine room. The 
hundred-foot ship shot suddenly forward under  

71
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,080
the thrust of her tail ion-rockets. A blue-red 
cloud formed slowly behind her and expanded.  

72
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Talbot appeared, and silently took her over 
from Kendall. "Stations, men," snapped Kendall.  

73
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,720
"Emergency call from a miner of Pluto reporting 
a large armed vessel which attacked them."  

74
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,800
Kendall swung back, and eased himself against the 
thrusting acceleration of the over-powered little  

75
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,280
ship, toward the engine room. Cole was bending 
over his apparatus, making careful check-ups,  

76
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,400
closing weapon-circuits. No window gave view of 
space here; on the left was the tiny tender's  

77
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,600
pocket, on the right, above and below the 
great water tanks that fed the ion-rockets,  

78
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,840
behind the rockets themselves. The tungsten metal 
walls were cold and gray under the ship lights;  

79
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,360
the hunched bulks of the apparatus crowded the 
tiny room. Gigantic racked accumulators huddled  

80
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,880
in the corners. Martin and Garnet swung into 
position in the fighting-tanks just ahead of  

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,280
the power rooms; Canning slid rapidly through 
the engine room, oozed through a tiny door,  

82
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,560
and took up his position in the stern-chamber, 
seated half-over the great ion-rocket sheath.

83
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,160
"Ready in positions, Captain Kendall," called the  

84
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
war-pilot as the little green 
lights appeared on his board.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,320
"Test discharges on maximum," ordered Kendall. 
He turned to Cole. "You start the automatic key?"

86
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,920
"Right, Captain."

87
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,520
"All shipshape?"

88
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,000
"Right as can be. Accumulators at thirty-seven 
per cent, thanks to the loaf out here. They ought  

89
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
to pick up our signal back on Jupiter, he's 
nearest now. The station on Europa will get it."

90
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,840
"Talbot—we are only to investigate if the ship 
is as reported. Have you seen any signs of her?"

91
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
"No sir, and the signals are blank."

92
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,840
"I'll work from here." Kendall took his position 
at the commanding control. Cole made way for him,  

93
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,200
and moved to the power board. One by one he tested 
the automatic doors, the pressure bulkheads.  

94
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
Kendall watched the instruments as one 
after another of the weapons were tested  

95
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,920
on momentary full discharge—titanic 
flames of five million volt protons.  

96
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
Then the ship thudded to the 
chatter of the Garnell rifles.

97
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,720
Tensely the men watched the planet 
ahead, white, yet barely visible in  

98
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,920
the weak sunlight so far out. It was swimming 
slowly nearer as the tiny ship gathered speed.

99
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,720
Kendall cast a glance over 
his detector-instruments.  

100
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,720
The radio network was undisturbed, the 
magnetic and electric fields recognized  

101
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,720
only the slight disturbances occasioned by 
the planet itself. There was nothing, noth—

102
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,240
Five hundred miles away, a gigantic 
ship came into instantaneous being.  

103
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,960
Simultaneously, and instantaneously, the various 
detector systems howled their warnings. Kendall  

104
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,160
gasped as the thing appeared on his view 
screen, with the scale-lines below. The scale  

105
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
must be cock-eyed. They said the ship was fifteen 
hundred feet in diameter, and two thousand long!

106
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,520
"Retreat," ordered Kendall, 
"at maximum acceleration."

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,720
Talbot was already acting. The gyroscopes hummed 
in their castings, and the motors creaked.  

108
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,840
The T-247 spun on her axis, and abruptly the 
acceleration built up as the ion-rockets began  

109
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,720
to shudder. A faint smell of "heat" 
began to creep out of the converter.  

110
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Immense "weight" built up, and pressed the 
men into their specially designed seats—

111
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:53,120
The gigantic ship across the way turned slowly, 
and seemed to stare at the T-247. Then it darted  

112
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,520
toward them at incredible speed till the poor 
little T-247 seemed to be standing still,  

113
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,000
as sailors say. The stranger was so gigantic 
now, the screens could not show all of him.

114
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,840
"God, Buck—he's going to take us!"

115
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,840
Simultaneously, the T-247 rolled, and from her 
broke every possible stream of destruction.  

116
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,720
The ion-rocket flames swirled abruptly toward 
her, the proton-guns whined their song of death  

117
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,440
in their housings, and the heavy pounding 
shudder of the Garnell guns racked the ship.

118
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,720
Strangely, Kendall suddenly noticed, 
there was a stillness in the ship.  

119
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,120
The guns and the rays were still going—but 
the little human sounds seemed abruptly gone.

120
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,640
"Talbot—Garnet—" Only silence answered him.  

121
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,840
Cole looked across at him in 
sudden white-faced amazement.

122
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,720
"They're gone—" gasped Cole.

123
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,120
Kendall stood paralyzed for thirty seconds. 
Then suddenly he seemed to come to life.  

124
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,640
"Neutrons! Neutrons—and water 
tanks! Old Nichols was right—"  

125
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,640
He turned to his friend. "Cole—the tender—quick." 
He darted a glance at the screen. The giant  

126
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,680
ship still lay alongside. A wash of ions was 
curling around her, splitting, and passing on.  

127
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,920
The pinprick explosions of the Garnell shells 
dotted space around her—but never on her.

128
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,800
Cole was already racing for the tender lock. 
In an instant Kendall piled in after him.  

129
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,600
The tiny ship, scarcely ten feet long, was powered 
for flights of only two hours acceleration,  

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,200
and had oxygen for but twenty-four hours for 
six men, seventy-two hours for two men—maybe.  

131
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,640
The heavy door was slammed shut behind 
them, as Cole seated himself at the  

132
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,600
panel. He depressed a lever, and a sudden 
smooth push shot them away from the T-247.

133
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,920
"DON'T!" called Kendall sharply as Cole 
reached for the ion-rocket control.  

134
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:15,200
"Douse those lights!" The ship was dark in dark 
space. The lighted hull of the T-247 drifted away  

135
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,880
from the little tender—further and further till 
the giant ship on the far side became visible.

136
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,320
"Not a light—not a sign of fields in operation." 
Kendall said, unconsciously speaking softly.  

137
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,320
"This thing is so tiny, that it 
may escape their observation in  

138
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,560
the fields of the T-247 and Pluto 
down there. It's our only hope."

139
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,800
"What happened? How in the name of the 
planets did they kill those men without a  

140
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,120
sound, without a flash, and without 
even warning us, or injuring us?"

141
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
"Neutrons—don't you see?"

142
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,800
"Frankly, I don't. I'm no 
scientist—merely a technician.  

143
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,560
Neutrons aren't used in any 
process I've run across."

144
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,120
"Well, remember they're uncharged, tiny things. 
Small as protons, but without electric field. The  

145
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,320
result is they pass right through an ordinary atom 
without being stopped unless they make a direct  

146
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,520
hit. Tungsten, while it has a beautifully high 
melting point, is mostly open space, and a neutron  

147
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,760
just sails right through it, or any heavy atom. 
Light atoms stop neutrons better—there's less open  

148
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:33,760
space in 'em. Hydrogen is best. Well—a man is made 
up mostly of light elements, and a man stops those  

149
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,840
neutrons—it isn't surprising it killed those 
other fellows invisibly, and without a sound."

150
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600
"You mean they bathed that ship in neutrons?"

151
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,880
"Shot it full of 'em. Just like our 
proton guns, only sending neutrons."

152
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
"Well, why weren't we killed too?"

153
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,880
"'Water stops neutrons,' I said. Figure it out."

154
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,240
"The rocket-water tanks—all around us! Great 
masses of water—" gasped Cole. "That saved us?"

155
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
"Right. I wonder if they've spotted us."

156
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,280
The stranger ship was moving 
slowly in relation to the T-247.  

157
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Suddenly the motion changed, the stranger spun—and 
a giant lock appeared in her side, opened.  

158
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,760
The T-247 began to move, floated more 
and more rapidly straight for the lock.  

159
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,320
Her various weapons had stopped operating now, 
the hoppers of the Garnell guns exhausted,  

160
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,280
the charge of the accumulators aboard the 
ship down so low the proton guns had died out.

161
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
"Lord—they're taking the whole ship!"

162
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,560
"Say—Cole, is that any ship you ever heard of 
before? I don't think that's just a pirate!"

163
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
"Not a pirate—what then?"

164
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,400
"How'd he get inside our detector screens so 
fast? Watch—he'll either leave, or come after us—"  

165
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,080
The T-247 had settled inside the lock now, 
and the great metal door closed after it.  

166
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,760
The whole patrol ship had been swallowed 
by a giant. Kendall was sketching swiftly  

167
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,680
on a notebook, watching the vast ship closely, 
putting down a record of its lines, and formation.  

168
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,480
He glanced up at it, and then down 
for a few more lines, and up at it—

169
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,560
The stranger ship abruptly dwindled. It dwindled 
with incredible speed, rushing off along the line  

170
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,400
of sight at an impossible velocity, and abruptly 
clicking out of sight, like an image on a  

171
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
movie-film that has been cut, and repaired after 
the scene that showed the final disappearance.

172
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,960
"Cole—Cole—did you get that? Did you see—do  

173
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,640
you understand what happened?" 
Kendall was excitedly shouting now.

174
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,560
"He missed us," Cole sighed. "It's 
a wonder—hanging out here in space,  

175
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,520
with the protector of the T-247's fields gone."

176
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,040
"No, no, you asteroid—that's not it. 
He went off faster than light itself!"

177
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,640
"Eh—what? Faster than light? That can't be done—"

178
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,200
"He did it, I know he did. That's how he got 
inside our screens. He came inside faster  

179
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,320
than the warning message could relay back the 
information. Didn't you see him accelerate to  

180
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,960
an impossible speed in an impossible time? Didn't 
you see how he just vanished as he exceeded the  

181
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,600
speed of light, and stopped reflecting it? 
That ship was no ship of this solar system!"

182
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,000
"Where did he come from then?"

183
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,840
"God only knows, but it's a long, long way off."

184
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:18,960
The IP-M-122 picked them up.  

185
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,880
The M-122 got out there two days later, in 
response to the calls the T-247 had sent out.  

186
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,040
As soon as she got within ten million miles of the 
little tender, she began getting Cole's signals,  

187
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,840
and within twelve hours had reached the 
tiny thing, located it, and picked it up.

188
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,040
Captain Jim Warren was in command, one 
of the old school commanders of the IP.  

189
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,560
He listened to Kendall's report, listened to 
Cole's tale—and radioed back a report of his own.  

190
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,400
Space pirates in a large ship had attacked the 
T-247, he said, and carried it away. He advised  

191
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,320
a close watch. On Pluto, his investigations 
disclosed nothing more than the fact that three  

192
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,760
mines had been raided, all platinum supplies 
taken, and the records and machinery removed.

193
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,160
The M-122 was a fifty-man patrol cruiser, and 
Warren felt sure he could handle the menace alone,  

194
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,480
and hung around for over two weeks 
looking for it. He saw nothing,  

195
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,280
and no further reports came of attack. Again and 
again, Kendall tried to convince him this ship he  

196
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,920
was hunting was no mere space pirate, and again 
and again Warren grunted, and went on his way.  

197
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,280
He would not send in any report Kendall made out, 
because to do so would add his endorsement to  

198
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,480
that report. He would not take Kendall back, 
though that was well within his authority.

199
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,080
In fact, it was a full month before Kendall again 
set foot on any of the Minor Planets, and then it  

200
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,280
was Mars, the base of the M-122. Kendall and Cole 
took passage immediately on an IP supply ship,  

201
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,360
and landed in New York six days later. At once, 
Kendall headed for Commander McLaurin's office.  

202
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
Buck Kendall, lieutenant of the 
IP, found he would have to make  

203
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
regular application to see McLaurin 
through a dozen intermediate officers.

204
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,080
By this time, Kendall was savagely determined 
to see McLaurin himself, and see him in the  

205
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,320
least possible time. Cole, too, was beginning to 
believe in Kendall's assertion of the stranger  

206
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,760
ship's extra-systemic origin. As yet neither could 
understand the strange actions of the machine,  

207
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,840
its attack on the Pluto mines, and the 
capture and theft of a patrol ship.

208
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,440
"There is," said Kendall angrily, "just one way 
to see McLaurin and see him quick. And, by God,  

209
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm going to. Will you resign with me, Cole? 
I'll see him within a week then, I'll bet."

210
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,960
For a minute, Cole hesitated. Then he shook hands 
with his friends. "Today!" And that day it was.  

211
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,000
They resigned, together. Immediately, Buck Kendall 
got the machinery in motion for an interview,  

212
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,640
working now from the outside, pulling the 
strings with the weight of a hundred million  

213
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,960
dollar fortune. Even the IP officers had to 
pay a bit of attention when Bernard Kendall,  

214
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,720
multi-millionaire began talking and demanding 
things. Within a week, Kendall did see McLaurin.

215
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,800
At that time, McLaurin was fifty-three years 
old, his crisp hair still black as space, with  

216
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:48,560
scarcely a touch of the gray that appears in his 
more recent photographs. He stood six feet tall,  

217
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,840
a broad-shouldered, powerful man, his face 
grave with lines of intelligence and character.  

218
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,560
There was also a permanent narrowing of the 
eyes, from years under the blazing sun of space.  

219
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,920
But most of all, while those years in space had 
narrowed and set his eyes, they had not narrowed  

220
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,960
and set his mind. An infinitely finer character 
than old Jim Warren, his experience in space had  

221
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,280
taught him always to expect the unexpected, to 
understand the incomprehensible as being part  

222
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,720
of the unknown and incalculable properties 
of space and the worlds that swam in it.  

223
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,520
Besides the fine technical education he had 
started with, he had acquired a liberal education  

224
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,200
in mankind. When Buck Kendall, straight and 
powerful, came into his office with Cole,  

225
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,560
he recognized in him a character that would 
drive steadily and straight for its goal.  

226
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,520
Also, he recognized behind the millionaire that 
had succeeded in pulling wires enough to see him,  

227
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,240
the scientist who had had more than one 
paper published "in an amateur way."

228
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
"Dr. Bernard Kendall?" he asked, rising.

229
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
"Yes, sir. Late Buck Kendall, lieutenant  

230
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,400
of the IP. I quit and got Cole here 
to quit with me, so we could see you."

231
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,600
"Unusual tactics. I've had several men join up 
to get an interview with me." McLaurin smiled.

232
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,280
"Yes, I can imagine that, but we had to see 
you in a hurry. A hidebound old rapscallion  

233
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,800
by the name of Jim Warren picked us up out by 
Pluto, floating around in a six-man tender.  

234
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,320
We made some reports to him, but he wouldn't 
believe, and he wouldn't send them through—so we  

235
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,240
had to send ourselves through. Sir, this system is 
about to be attacked by some extra-systemic race.  

236
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,120
The IP-T-247 was so attacked, her crew killed 
off, and the ship itself carried away."

237
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,960
"I got the report Captain Jim Warren sent through,  

238
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,200
stating it was a gang of space pirates. 
Now what makes you believe otherwise?"

239
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,400
"That ship that attacked us, 
attacked with a neutron gun,  

240
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,600
a gun that shot neutrons through the hull of our 
ship as easily as protons pass through open space.  

241
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,520
Those neutrons killed off four of the crew, 
and spared us only because we happened to be  

242
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,000
behind the water tanks. Masses of hydrogen will 
stop neutrons, so we lived, and escaped in the  

243
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,160
tender. The little tender, lightless, escaped 
their observation, and we were picked up.  

244
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,600
Now, when the 247 had been picked up, and locked 
into their ship, that ship started accelerating.  

245
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,320
It accelerated so fast along my line of 
sight that it just dwindled, and—vanished.  

246
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,320
It didn't vanish in distance, it vanished 
because it exceeded the speed of light."

247
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,120
"Isn't that impossible?"

248
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,840
"Not at all. It can be done—if you can find 
some way of escaping from this space to do it.  

249
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,440
Now if you could cut across through a higher 
dimension, your projection in this dimension  

250
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,880
might easily exceed the speed of light. For 
instance, if I could cut directly through  

251
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,680
the Earth, at a speed of one thousand miles 
an hour, my projection on the surface would  

252
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,360
go twelve thousand miles while I was going 
eight. Similar, if you could cut through the  

253
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
four dimensional space instead of following its 
surface, you'd attain a speed greater than light."

254
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,160
"Might it not still be a space pirate? 
That's a lot easier to believe,  

255
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,200
even allowing your statement that 
he exceeded the speed of light."

256
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,680
"If you invented a neutron gun which could 
kill through tungsten walls without injuring  

257
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,920
anything within, a system of accelerating a ship 
that didn't affect the inhabitants of that ship,  

258
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,920
and a means of exceeding the speed of light, 
all within a few months of each other,  

259
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,640
would you become a pirate? I wouldn't, and I 
don't think any one else would. A pirate is a  

260
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,000
man who seeks adventure and relief from work. 
Given a means of exceeding the speed of light,  

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,840
I'd get all the adventure I wanted investigating 
other planets. If I didn't have a cent before,  

262
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,920
I'd have relief from work by selling it for 
a few hundred millions—and I'd sell it mighty  

263
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,240
easily too, for an invention like that is 
worth an incalculable sum. Tie to that the  

264
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,640
value of compensated acceleration, and no man's 
going to turn pirate. He can make more millions  

265
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,840
selling his inventions than he can make thousands 
turning pirate with them. So who'd turn pirate?"

266
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,640
"Right." McLaurin nodded. "I see your point. 
Now before I'd accept your statements in re  

267
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,360
the 'speed of light' thing, I'd want 
opinions from some IP physicists."

268
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
"Then let's have a conference, because something's  

269
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,320
got to be done soon. I don't know why we 
haven't heard further from that fellow."

270
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,960
"Privately—we have," McLaurin said in a slightly 
worried tone. "He was detected by the instruments  

271
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,040
of every IP observatory I suspect. We got the 
reports but didn't know what to make of them.  

272
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,800
They indicated so many funny things, they 
were sent in as accidental misreadings of  

273
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,400
the instruments. But since all the observatories 
reported them, similar misreadings, at about the  

274
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,920
same times, that is with variations of only 
a few hours, we thought something must have  

275
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,400
been up. The only thing was the phenomena were 
reported progressively from Pluto to Neptune,  

276
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:34,160
clear across the solar system, in a definite 
progression, but at a velocity of crossing  

277
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,520
that didn't tie in with any conceivable force. 
They crossed faster than the velocity of light.  

278
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,720
That ship must have spent about half an hour off 
each planet before passing on to the next. And,  

279
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,880
accepting your faster-than-light 
explanation, we can understand it."

280
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,960
"Then I think you have proof."

281
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
"If we have, what would you do about it?"

282
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,360
"Get to work on those 'misreadings' 
of the instruments for one thing,  

283
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,200
and for a second, and more important, line every 
IP ship with paraffin blocks six inches thick."

284
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,600
"Paraffin—why?"

285
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,480
"The easiest form of hydrogen to get. You can't 
use solid hydrogen, because that melts too easily.  

286
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,640
Water can be turned into steam too easily, and 
requires more work. Paraffin is a solid that's  

287
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,360
largely hydrogen. That's what they've always 
used on neutrons since they discovered them.  

288
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,800
Confine your paraffin between tungsten walls,  

289
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,080
and you'll stop the secondary 
protons as well as the neutrons."

290
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,840
"Hmmm—I suppose so. How about 
seeing those physicists?"

291
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,400
"I'd like to see them today, sir. The 
sooner you get started on this work,  

292
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,240
the better it will be for the IP."

293
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,120
"Having seen me, will you join up 
in the IP again?" asked McLaurin.

294
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,960
"No, sir, I don't think I will. I have another 
field you know, in which I may be more useful.  

295
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,680
Cole here's a better technician than 
fighter—and a darned good fighter, too—and  

296
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,200
I think that an inexperienced space-captain is a 
lot less useful than a second-rate physicist at  

297
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,520
work in a laboratory. If we hope to get anywhere, 
or for that matter, I suspect, stay anywhere,  

298
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,160
we'll have to do a lot of 
research pretty promptly."

299
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,720
"What's your explanation of that ship?"

300
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,360
"One of two things: an inventor of some 
other system trying out his latest toy, or an  

301
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,440
expedition sent out by a planetary government for 
exploration. I favor the latter for two reasons:  

302
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,320
that ship was big. No inventor would build a 
thing that size, requiring a crew of several  

303
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,880
hundred men to try out his invention. A government 
would build just about that if they wanted to send  

304
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,920
out an expedition. If it were an inventor, 
he'd be interested in meeting other people,  

305
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,280
to see what they had in the way of science, and 
probably he'd want to do it in a peaceable way.  

306
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,720
That fellow wasn't interested in peace, by 
any means. So I think it's a government ship,  

307
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,560
and an unfriendly government. They sent that 
ship out either for scientific research,  

308
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:17,040
for trade research and exploration, or for 
acquisitive exploration. If they were out for  

309
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,440
scientific research, they'd proceed as would the 
inventor, to establish friendly communication.  

310
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,720
If they were out for trade, the same would apply. 
If they were out for acquisitive exploration,  

311
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,320
they'd investigate the planets, the sun, the 
people, only to the extent of learning how  

312
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,640
best to overcome them. They'd want to get a sample 
of our people, and a sample of our weapons. They'd  

313
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,520
want samples of our machinery, our literature and 
our technology. That's exactly what that ship got.

314
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,040
"Somebody, somewhere out there in space, either 
doesn't like their home, or wants more home.  

315
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,440
They've been out looking for one. I'll bet they 
sent out hundreds of expeditions to thousands  

316
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,160
of nearby stars, gradually going further 
and further, seeking a planetary system.  

317
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,600
This is probably the one and only one they found.  

318
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,920
It's a good one too. It has planets at all 
temperatures, of all sizes. It is a fairly  

319
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,880
compact one, it has a stable sun that will 
last far longer than any race can hope to."

320
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
"Hmm—how can there be good 
and bad planetary systems?"  

321
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,440
asked McLaurin. "I'd never thought of that."

322
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:38,080
Kendall laughed. "Mighty easy. How'd you like to 
live on a planet of a Cepheid Variable? Pleasant  

323
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,400
situation, with the radiation flaring up and down. 
How'd you like to live on a planet of Antares?  

324
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,400
That blasted sun is so big, to have a comfortable 
planet you'd have to be at least ten billion miles  

325
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,320
out. Then if you had an interplanetary commerce, 
you'd have to struggle with orbits tens of  

326
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:04,000
billions of miles across instead of mere millions. 
Further, you'd have a sun so blasted big,  

327
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,760
it would take an impossible amount of energy to 
lift the ship up from one planet to another. If  

328
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,440
your trip was, say, twenty billions of miles to 
the next planet, you'd be fighting a gravity as  

329
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,440
bad as the solar gravity at Earth here all the 
way—no decline with a little distance like that."

330
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,800
"H-m-m-m—quite true. Then I should say that Mira 
would take the prize. It's a red giant, and it's  

331
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,600
an irregular variable. The sunlight there would 
be as unstable as the weather in New England. It's  

332
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,240
almost as big as Antares, and it won't hold still. 
Now that would make a bad planetary system."

333
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,000
"It would!" Kendall laughed. But as we know—he  

334
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,160
laughed too soon, and he shouldn't have used 
the conditional. He should have said, "It does!"

335
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:23,200
Gresth Gkae, Commander of Expeditionary Force 
93, of the Planet Sthor, was returning homeward  

336
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:31,360
with joyful mind. In the lock of his great ship, 
lay the T-247. In her cargo holds lay various  

337
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,000
items of machinery, mining supplies, foods, and 
records. And in her log books lay the records  

338
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,120
of many readings on the nine larger planets 
of a highly satisfactory planetary system.

339
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,680
Gresth Gkae had spent no less than three 
ultra-wearing years going from one sun to another  

340
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:58,000
in a definitely mapped out section of space. He 
had investigated only eleven stars in that time,  

341
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,880
eleven stars, progressively further from the 
titanic red-flaming sun he knew as "the" sun.  

342
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,360
He knew it as "the" sun, and had several other 
appellations for it. Mira was so-named by  

343
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,840
Earthmen because it was indeed a "wonder" 
star, in Latin, mirare means "to wonder."  

344
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Irregularly, and for no apparent reason 
it would change its rate of radiation.  

345
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,200
So far as those inhabitants of Sthor and her 
sister world Asthor knew, there was no reason. It  

346
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,960
just did it. Perhaps with malicious intent to be 
annoying. If so, it was exceptionally successful.  

347
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,120
Sthor and Asthor experienced, periodically, 
a young ice age. When Mira decided to take  

348
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,960
a rest, Sthor and Asthor froze up, from 
the poles most of the way to the equators.  

349
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,120
Then Mira would stretch herself a little, 
move about restlessly and Sthor and Asthor  

350
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,840
would become uninhabitably hot, anywhere 
within twenty degrees of the equator.

351
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:12,080
Those Sthorian people had evolved in a way 
that made the conditions endurable for savage  

352
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,600
or uncivilized people, but when a scientific 
civilization with a well-ordered mode of  

353
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,800
existence tried to establish itself, 
Mira was all sorts of a nuisance.

354
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,280
Gresth Gkae was a peculiar individual to human 
ways of thinking. He stood some seven feet tall,  

355
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,120
on his strange, double-kneed legs and his four 
toed feet. His body was covered with little,  

356
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,800
short feather-like things that moved now with 
a volition of their own. They were moving very  

357
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,200
slowly and regularly. The space-ship was heated 
to a comfortable temperature, and the little fans  

358
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,840
were helping to cool Gresth Gkae. Had it been 
cold, every little feather would have lain down  

359
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,400
close against its neighbors, forming an 
admirable, wind-proof and cold-proof blanket.

360
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:09,280
Nature, on Sthor, had original ideas of 
arrangement too. Sthorians possessed two eyes—one  

361
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,720
directly above the other, in the center 
of their faces. The face was so long,  

362
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,640
and narrow, it resembled a blunt hatchet, with 
the two eyes on the edge. To counter-balance  

363
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,360
this vertical arrangement of the eyes, the 
nostrils had been separated some four inches,  

364
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,920
with one on each of the sloping cheeks. His 
ears were little pink-flesh cups on short,  

365
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,720
muscular stems. His mouth was narrow, and small, 
but armed with quite solid teeth adapted to his  

366
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,000
diet, a diet consisting of almost anything 
any creature had ever considered edible.  

367
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,320
Like most successful forms of intelligent life, 
Gresth Gkae was omnivorous. An intelligent form  

368
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,400
of life is necessarily adaptable, and adaptation 
meant being able to eat what was at hand.

369
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,840
One of his eyes, the upper one, was 
fully twice the size of the lower one.  

370
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,320
This was his telescopic eye. The lower, 
or microscopic eye was adapted to work  

371
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,160
for which a human being would have 
required a low power microscope,  

372
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,320
the upper eye possessed a more normal power of 
vision, plus considerable telescopic powers.

373
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Gresth Gkae was using it now to look ahead in the 
blank of space to where gigantic Mira appeared.  

374
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,160
On his screens now, Mira appeared deep 
violet, for he was approaching at a speed  

375
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,720
greater than that of light, and even this 
projected light of Mira was badly distorted.

376
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,840
"The distance is half a light-year now, 
sir," reported the navigation officer.

377
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
"Reduce the speed, then, to normal velocity for 
these ranges. What reserve of fuel have we?"

378
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,480
"Less than one thousand pounds. We 
will barely be able to stop. We were  

379
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,920
too free in the use of our weapons, I 
fear," replied the Chief Technician.

380
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,600
"Well, what would you? We needed those things in 
our reports. Besides, we could extract fuel from  

381
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,440
that ore we took on at Planet Nine of Phahlo. 
It is merely that I wish speed in the return."

382
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,560
"As we all do. How soon do you believe the 
Council will proceed against the new system?"

383
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,440
"It will be fully a year, I fear. They must gather 
the expeditions together, and re-equip the ships.  

384
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,560
It will be a long time before 
all will have come in."

385
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
"Could they not send fast ships 
after them to recall them?"

386
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,600
"Could they have traced us as we 
wove our way from Thart to Karst  

387
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,920
to Raloork to Phahlo? It would be impossible."

388
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,160
Steadily the great ship had been boring on her 
way. Mira had been a disc for nearly two days,  

389
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,360
gigantic, two-hundred-and-fifty-million-mile Mira 
took a great deal of dwarfing by distance to lose  

390
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,120
her disc. Even at the Twin Planets, eight thousand 
two hundred and fifty millions of miles out,  

391
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,600
Mira covered half the sky, it seemed, 
red and angry. Sometimes, though,  

392
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,400
to the disgust of the Sthorians it was 
just red-faced and lazy. Then Sthor froze.

393
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,720
"Grih is in a descendant stage," said 
the navigation officer presently.  

394
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,840
"Sthor will be cold when we arrive."

395
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
"It will warm quickly enough 
with our news!" Gresth laughed.  

396
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:37,760
"A system—a delightful system—discovered. A system 
of many close-grouped planets. Why think—from one  

397
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,280
side of that system to the other is less of a 
distance than from Ansthat, our first planet's  

398
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,400
orbit, to Insthor's orbit! That sun, as we know, 
is steady and warm. All will be well, when we have  

399
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,240
eliminated that rather peculiar race. Odd, that 
they should, in some ways, be so nearly like us!  

400
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Nearly Sthorian in build. I would not have 
expected it. Though they did have some  

401
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:11,600
amazing peculiarities! Imagine—two eyes just 
alike, and in a horizontal row. And that flat  

402
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,640
face. They looked as though they had suffered some 
accident that smashed the front of the face in.  

403
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,160
And also the peculiar beak-like projection. Why 
should a race ever develop so amazing a projection  

404
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,440
in so peculiar and exposed a position? 
It sticks out inviting attack and injury.  

405
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,400
Right in the middle of the face. And to make it 
worse, there is the air-channel, and the only air  

406
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,880
channel. Why, one minor injury to the throat would 
be certain to damage that passage beyond repair,  

407
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,960
and bring death. Yet such relatively unimportant 
things as ears, and eyes are doubled.  

408
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,640
Surely you would expect that so important a member 
as the air-passage would be doubled for safety.

409
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,280
"Those strange, awkward arms and legs were 
what puzzled me. I have been attempting to  

410
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,560
manipulate myself as they must be forced to, 
and I cannot see how delicate or accurate  

411
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,400
manual manipulation would be possible with 
those rigid, inflexible arms. In some ways I  

412
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,560
feel they must have had clever minds to overcome 
so great a handicap to constructive work. But I  

413
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,280
suppose single joints in the arms become as 
natural to them as our own more mobile two.

414
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,840
"I wonder if life in any intelligent form wouldn't 
develop somewhat similar formations, though.  

415
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,840
Think, in all parts of Sthor, before men 
became civilized and developed communication,  

416
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,240
even so much as twenty thousand years ago, our 
records show that seats and chairs were much  

417
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,760
as they are today, and much as they are, 
in all places among all groups. Then too,  

418
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,640
the eye has developed in many different species, 
and always reached much the same structure.  

419
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,440
When a thing is intended and 
developed to serve a given purpose,  

420
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,040
no matter who develops it, or where or how, is 
it not apt to have similar shapes and parts?  

421
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:10,160
A chair must have legs, and a seat and arm-rests 
and a back. You may vary their nature and their  

422
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,960
shape, but not widely, and they must be there. 
An eye must, anywhere, have a sensitive retina,  

423
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,520
an adjustable lens, and an adjustable device 
for controlling the entrance of light.  

424
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,960
Similarly there are certain functions that 
the body of an intelligent creature must serve  

425
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,960
which naturally tend to make intelligent 
creatures similar. He must have a tool—the hand—"

426
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,280
"Yes, yes—I see your point. It must be so, for  

427
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
surely these creatures out there 
are strange enough in other ways."

428
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,920
"But tell me, have you 
calculated when we shall land?"

429
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
"In twelve hours, thirty-three minutes, sir."

430
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,160
Eleven hours later, the expedition ship 
had slowed to a normal space-speed.  

431
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,800
On her left hung the giant globe of Asthor, 
rotating slowly, moving slowly in her orbit.  

432
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,480
Directly ahead, Sthor loomed even greater. 
Tiny Teelan, the thousand-mile diameter  

433
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,400
moon of the Insthor system shone dull red 
in the reflected light of gigantic Mira.  

434
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:21,840
Mira herself was gigantic, red and menacing across 
eight and a quarter billions of miles of space.

435
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,640
One hundred thousand miles apart, the twin worlds  

436
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,800
Sthor and Asthor rotated about their common 
center of gravity, eternally facing each other.  

437
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,360
Ten million miles from their common center 
of gravity, Teelan rotated in a vast orbit.

438
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:48,000
Sthor and Asthor were capped at each pole now 
by gigantic white icecaps. Mira was sulking,  

439
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,400
and as a consequence the planets were freezing.

440
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,080
The expedition ship sank slowly toward Sthor. 
A swarm of smaller craft had flown up at its  

441
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,320
approach to meet it. A gaily-colored small 
ship marked the official greeting-ship.  

442
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,480
Gresth had withheld his news purposely. Now 
suddenly he began broadcasting it from the  

443
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,600
powerful transmitter on his ship. As the 
words came through on a thousand sets,  

444
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:21,040
all the little ships began to whirl, dance 
and break out into glowing, sparkling lights.  

445
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:30,000
On Sthor and Asthor even commotions began to be 
visible. A new planetary system had been found—  

446
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,480
They could move! Their overflowing 
populations could be spread out!

447
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,160
The whole Insthor system went mad with delight 
as the great Expeditionary Ship settled downward.

448
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,200
There was a glint of humor in Buck 
Kendall's eyes as he passed the sheet  

449
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,480
over to McLaurin. Commander McLaurin looked 
down the columns with twinkling eyes.

450
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,400
"'Petition to establish the Lunar Mining 
Bank,'" he read. "What a bank! Officers:  

451
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,680
President, General James Logan, late of the IP;  

452
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:30,480
Vice-president, Colonel Warren Gerardhi, also 
late of the IP; Staff, consists of 90% ex-IP men,  

453
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,760
and a few scattered accountants. Designed 
by the well-known designer of IP stations,  

454
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,080
Colonel Richard Murray." Commander McLaurin 
looked up at Kendall with a broad grin.  

455
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,800
"And you actually got Interplanetary Life 
to give you a mortgage on the structure?"

456
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,600
"Why not? It'll cut cost fifty-eight millions, 
with its twelve-foot tungsten-beryllium walls and  

457
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,800
the heavy defense weapons against those terrible 
pirates. You know we must defend our property."

458
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,600
"With the thing you're setting up out 
there on Luna, you could more readily  

459
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,080
wipe out the IP than anything else 
I know of. Any new defense ideas?"

460
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,920
"Plenty. Did you get any further appropriations 
from the IP Appropriations Board?"

461
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,160
McLaurin looked sour. "No. The 
dear taxpayers might object,  

462
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,120
and those thickheaded, clogged rockets on the 
Board can't see your data on the Stranger.  

463
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,800
They gave me just ten millions, and that only 
because you demonstrated you could shoot every  

464
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,680
living thing out of the latest IP cruiser 
with that neutron gun of yours. By the way,  

465
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,120
they may kick when I don't 
install more than a few of those."

466
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,960
"Let 'em. You can stall for a few months. 
You'll need that money more for other purposes.  

467
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,360
You've installed that paraffin lining?"

468
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,480
"Yes—I got a report on that of 'finished' 
last week. How have you made out?"

469
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,800
Buck Kendall's face fell. "Not so hot.  

470
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,520
Devin's been the biggest help—he did most 
of the work on that neutron gun really—"

471
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,000
"After," McLaurin interrupted, "you told him how."

472
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,320
"—but we're pretty well stuck now, it 
seems. You'll be off duty tomorrow evening,  

473
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,520
can't you drop around to the lab? We're going to 
try out a new system for releasing atomic energy."

474
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,280
"Isn't that a pretty faint hope? We've been 
trying to get it for three centuries now,  

475
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,360
and haven't yet. What chance at 
it within a year or so?—which  

476
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,080
is the time you allow yourself 
before the Stranger returns."

477
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:37,120
"It is, I'll admit that. But there's another 
factor, not to be forgotten. The data we got  

478
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,480
from correlating those 'misreadings' 
from the various IP posts mean a lot.  

479
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,760
We are working on an entirely 
different trail now. You come on out,  

480
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,840
and you can see our new apparatus. They 
are working on tremendous voltages,  

481
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,520
and hoping to smash the thing by a brutal 
bombardment of terrific voltage. We're trying,  

482
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,120
thanks to the results of those instruments, to get 
results with small, terrifically intense fields."

483
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
"How do you know that's their general system?"

484
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,160
"They left traces on the 
records of the post instruments.  

485
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:16,240
These records show such intensities as 
we never got. They have atomic energy,  

486
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,240
necessarily, and they might have had material 
energy, actual destruction of matter,  

487
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,080
but apparently, from the field readings it's the 
former. To be able to make those tremendous hops,  

488
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,680
light-years in length, they needed a real 
store of energy. They have accumulators,  

489
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,080
of course, but I don't think they could store 
enough power by the system they use to do it."

490
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,080
"Well, how's your trick 'bank' out on 
Luna, despite its twelve-foot walls,  

491
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,000
going to stand an atomic explosion?"

492
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:54,400
"More protective devices to come is our only hope. 
I'm working on three trails: atomic energy, some  

493
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,920
type of magnetic shield that will stop any moving 
material particle, and their faster-than-light  

494
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,400
thing. Also, that fortress—I mean, of course, 
bank—is going to have a lot of lead-lined rooms."

495
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,000
"I wish I could use the remaining money the 
Board gave me to lead-line a lot of those  

496
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,280
IP ships," said McLaurin wistfully. "Can't 
you make a gamma-ray bomb of some sort?"

497
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,760
"Not without their atomic energy release. With it, 
of course, it's easy to flood a region with rays.  

498
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,920
It'll be a million times worse than 
radium 'C,' which is bad enough."

499
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,920
"Well, I'll send through this petition 
for armaments. They'll pass it all right,  

500
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,320
I think. They may get some kicks from old Jacob 
Ezra Stubbs. Jacob Ezra doesn't believe in  

501
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,480
anything war-like. I wish they'd find some way to 
keep him off of the Arms Petition Board. He might  

502
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:54,240
just as well stay home and let 'em vote his ticket 
uniformly 'nay.'" Buck Kendall left with a laugh.

503
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,400
Buck Kendall had his troubles though. 
When he had reached Earth again,  

504
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,480
he found that his properties totaled one 
hundred and three million dollars, roughly.  

505
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,840
One doesn't sell properties of that 
magnitude, one borrows against them.  

506
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:14,000
But to all intents and purposes, Buck Kendall 
owned two half-completed ship's hulls in the  

507
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,240
Baldwin Spaceship Yards, a great deal of massive 
metal work on its way to Luna, and contracts  

508
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,600
for some very extensive work on a "bank." 
Beyond that, about eleven million was left.

509
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,520
A large portion of the money had 
been invested in a laboratory,  

510
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,000
the like of which the world had never seen. It was 
devoted exclusively to physics, and principally  

511
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
the physics of destruction. Dr. Paul Devin 
was the Director, Cole was in charge of the  

512
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,400
technical work, and Buck Kendall was free 
to do all the work he thought needed doing.

513
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,160
Returned to his laboratory, he looked sourly 
at the bench on which seven mechanicians were  

514
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,280
working. The ninth successive experiment 
on the release of atomic energy had failed.  

515
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,640
The tenth was in process of construction. A 
heavy pure tungsten dome, three feet in diameter,  

516
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,800
three inches thick, was being 
lowered over a clear insulum dome,  

517
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,800
a foot smaller. Inside, the real apparatus was 
arranged around the little pool of mercury.  

518
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,760
From it, two massive tungsten-copper alloy 
conductors led through the insulum housing,  

519
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,920
and outside. These, so Kendall had hoped, 
would surge with the power of broken atoms,  

520
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,080
but he was beginning to believe rather 
bitterly, they would never do so.

521
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,400
Buck went on to his offices, 
and the main calculator room.  

522
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,720
There were ten calculator tables 
here, two of them in operation now.

523
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,840
"Hello, Devin. Getting on?"

524
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,880
"No," said Devin bitterly, "I'm getting off. 
Look at these results." He brought over a sheaf  

525
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,200
of graphs, with explanatory tables attached. 
Rapidly Buck ran through them with him. Most  

526
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,120
of them were graphs of functions of light, 
considered as a wave in these experiments.

527
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,240
"H-m-m-m—not very encouraging. Looks like 
you've got the field—but it just snaps shut  

528
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,760
on itself and won't work. The lack of volume 
makes it break down, if you establish it,  

529
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,680
and makes it impossible to establish in the 
first place without the energy of matter.  

530
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,480
Not so hot. That's certainly cock-eyed somewhere."

531
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,840
"I'm not. The math may be."

532
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,880
"Well"—Kendall grinned—"it amounts 
to the same thing. The point is,  

533
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:39,840
light doesn't. Let's run over that theory 
again. Light is not only magnetic; but electric.  

534
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,680
Somehow it transforms electric fields 
cyclically into magnetic fields and back again.  

535
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,200
Now what we want to do is to transform an electric 
into a magnetic field and have it stay there.  

536
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,360
That's the first step. The second thing, is to 
have the lines of magnetic force you develop,  

537
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:05,280
lie down like a sheath around the ship, instead of 
standing out like the hairs on an angry cat, the  

538
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,120
way they want to. That means turning them ninety 
degrees, and turning an electric into a magnetic  

539
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:18,320
field means turning the space-strain ninety 
degrees. Light evidently forms a magnetic field  

540
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,840
whose lines of force reach along its direction 
of motion, so that's your starting point."

541
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:31,280
"Yes, and that," growled Devin, "seems to be the 
finishing point. Quite definitely and clearly,  

542
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,840
the graph looped down to zero. In other words, the 
field closed in on itself, and destroyed itself."

543
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,720
"Light doesn't vanish."

544
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,080
"I'll make you all the lights you want."

545
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,960
"I simply mean there must be 
something that will stop it."

546
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,880
"Certainly. Transform it back to electric 
field before it gets a chance to close in,  

547
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
then repeat the process—the way light does."

548
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,600
"That wouldn't make such a good magnetic shield. 
Every time that field started pulsing out through  

549
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:07,280
the walls of the ship it would generate heat. 
We want a permanent field that will stay on the  

550
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,240
job out there. I wonder if you couldn't make 
a conductor device that would open that field  

551
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,320
out—some special type of oscillating 
field that would keep it open."

552
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,680
"H-m-m-m—that's an angle I 
might try. Any suggestions?"

553
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
Kendall had suggestions, and rapidly 
he outlined a development that appeared  

554
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,480
from some of the earlier mathematics on 
light, and might be what they wanted.

555
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,520
Kendall, however, had problems of his own 
to work on. The question of atomic energy he  

556
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,800
was leaving alone, till the present experiment 
either succeeded, or, as he rather suspected,  

557
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,480
failed as had its predecessors. His present 
problem was to develop more fully some  

558
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,760
interesting lines of research he had run across in 
investigating mathematically the trick of turning  

559
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,520
electric to magnetic fields and then turning them 
back again. It might be that along this line he  

560
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,320
would find the answer to the speed greater than 
that of light. At any rate, he was interested.

561
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,040
He worked the rest of that day, and most of the 
next on that line—till he ran it into the ground  

562
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:21,280
with a pair of equations that ended with the 
expression: dx.dv=h/(4πm). Then Kendall looked  

563
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,920
at them for a long moment, then he sighed 
gently and threw them into a file cabinet.  

564
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,560
Heisenberg's Uncertainty. He'd reduced the thing 
to a form that simply told him it was beyond  

565
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,400
the limits of certainty and he ran it into the 
normal, natural uncertainty inevitable in Nature.

566
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,120
Anyway he had real work to do now. The 
machine was about ready for his attention.  

567
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,520
The mechanicians had finished putting 
it in shape for demonstration and trial.  

568
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,880
He himself would have to test it over the rest of 
the afternoon and arrange for power and so forth.

569
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,640
By evening, when Commander McLaurin called 
around with some of the other investors in  

570
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,000
Kendall's "bank" on Luna, the thing was 
already started, warming up. The fields  

571
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,760
were being fed and the various scientists 
of the group were watching with interest.  

572
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,360
Power was flowing in already at a rate of nearly 
one hundred thousand horsepower per minute,  

573
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,000
thanks to a special line given them by New York 
Power (a Kendall property). At ten o'clock they  

574
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,760
were beginning to expect the reaction to start. By 
this time the fields weren't gaining in intensity  

575
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,280
very rapidly, a maximum intensity had been reached 
that should, they felt, break the atoms soon.

576
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,640
At eleven-thirty, through the little view window, 
Buck Kendall saw something that made him cry out  

577
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:47,280
in amazement. The mercury metal in the receiver, 
behind its layers of screening was beginning  

578
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:54,160
to glow, with a dull reddish light, and little 
solidifications were appearing in it! Eagerly the  

579
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:00,240
men looked, as the solidifications spread slowly, 
like crystals growing in an evaporating solution.

580
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,080
Twelve o'clock came and went, and one o'clock 
and two o'clock. Still the slow crystallization  

581
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:15,440
went on. Buck Kendall was casting furtive glances 
at the kilowatt-hour meter. It stood at a figure  

582
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,160
that represented twenty-seven thousand dollars' 
worth of power. Long since the power rate had  

583
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:27,120
been increased to the maximum available, as 
the power plant's normal load reduced as the  

584
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:35,040
morning hours came. Surely, this time something 
would start, but Buck had two worries. If all  

585
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,000
the enormous amount of energy they had poured 
in there decided to release itself at once—

586
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,440
And at any rate, Buck saw they'd never dare 
to let a generator stop, once it was started!

587
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:52,560
The men were a tense group around the machine at 
three-fifteen a.m. There remained only a tiny,  

588
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,080
dancing globule of silvery mercury skittering 
around on the sharp, needle-like crystals  

589
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,840
of the dull red metal that had resulted. 
Slowly that skittering drop was shrinking—

590
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Three twenty-two and a half a.m. 
saw the last fraction of it vanish.  

591
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,160
Tensely the men stared into the 
machine—backing off slowly—watching  

592
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,240
the meters on the board. At nearly eighty 
thousand volts the power had been fed into it.

593
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,040
The power continued to flow, 
and a growing halo of intense  

594
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,000
violet light appeared suddenly on those red, 
needle-like crystals, a swiftly expanding halo—

595
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,120
Without a sound, without the slightest 
disturbance, the halo vanished,  

596
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,760
and softly, gently, the 
needle-like crystals relapsed,  

597
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,560
melted away, and a dull pool of 
metallic mercury rested in the receiver.

598
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,040
At eighty thousand volts, power was flowing in—

599
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,840
And it didn't even sparkle.

600
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,440
The apparatus of the magnetic shield had been 
completed two days later, and set up in Buck's  

601
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,680
own laboratory. On the bench was the powerful, but 
small, little projector of the straight magnetic  

602
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:31,920
field, simply a specially designed accumulator, a 
super-condenser, and the peculiar apparatus Devin  

603
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,640
had designed to distort the electric field 
through ninety degrees to a magnetic field.  

604
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,240
Behind this was a curious, paraboloid 
projector made up of hundreds of tiny,  

605
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:48,880
carefully orientated coils. This was Buck's own 
contribution. They were ready for the tests.

606
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,920
"I would invite McLaurin in to see this," said 
Kendall looking at them, and then across the  

607
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,720
room bitterly toward the alleged atomic 
power apparatus on the opposite bench.  

608
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,080
"I think it will work. But after that—" He stared, 
glaring, at the heavy tungsten dome with its  

609
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:14,000
heavy tungsten contacts, across which the flame of 
released atomic energy was supposed to have leapt.  

610
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,760
"That was probably the flattest 
flop any experiment ever flopped."

611
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,960
"Well—it didn't blow up. That's 
one comfort," suggested Devin.

612
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,160
"I wish it had. Then at least it would have 
shown some response. The only response shown,  

613
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,840
actually, was shown on the power meter. It damn 
near wore out the bearings turning so fast."

614
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,160
"Personally, I prefer the lack of action." Devin 
laughed. "Have you got that circuit hooked up?"

615
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,840
"Right," sighed Kendall, turning back to 
the work in hand. "Is Douglass in on this?"

616
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,680
"Yes—in the next room. He'll let us know when 
he's ready. He's setting up those instruments."

617
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,520
Douglass, a young junior physicist, 
late of the IP Physics Department,  

618
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,800
stuck his head in the door and announced 
his instruments were all set up.

619
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,000
"Keep an eye on them. They'll 
move somehow, at any rate.  

620
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,840
This thing couldn't go as flat 
as that atom-buster of mine."

621
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,040
Carefully Kendall made a few last-minute 
adjustments on the limiting relays,  

622
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,800
and took up his position at the power board. 
Devin took his place near the apparatus,  

623
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,920
with another series of instruments, similar to 
those Douglass was now watching in the next room,  

624
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:34,240
some thirty feet away, through the two-inch 
metal wall. "Ready," called Kendall.

625
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,440
The switch shot home. Instantly Kendall, 
Devin, and all the men in the building  

626
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,920
jumped some six feet from their former positions.  

627
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,880
A monstrous roar of sound crashed out in that 
laboratory that thundered from one wall to  

628
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:55,600
the other, and bellowed in a Titan's fury. It 
thundered and growled, it bellowed and howled,  

629
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:00,000
the walls shook with the march and 
counter-march of crashing waves of sound.

630
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,960
And a ten-foot wavering flame of blue-white, 
bellying electric fire shuddered up to the  

631
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,120
ceiling from the contact points of the alleged 
atomic generator. The heat, pouring out from the  

632
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:19,440
flashing, roaring arc sent prickles of aching 
burns over Kendall's skin. For ten seconds he  

633
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:27,600
stood in utter, paralyzed surprise as his flop of 
flops bellowed its anger at his disdain. Then he  

634
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,320
leapt to the power board and shut off the roaring 
thing, by cutting the switch that had started it.

635
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,120
"Spirits of Space! Did that come to life!"

636
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,120
"Atomic Energy!" Devin cried.

637
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,040
"Atomic energy, hell. That's my thirty thousand 
dollars' worth of power breaking loose again,"  

638
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:53,680
chortled Kendall. "We missed the atomic energy, 
but, sweet boy, what an accumulator we stubbed our  

639
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,600
toes on! I wondered where in blazes all that power 
went to. That's the answer. I'll bet I can tell  

640
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:08,560
you right now what happened. We built that mercury 
up to a new level, and that transitional stage  

641
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:14,080
was the red, crystalline metal. When it reached 
the higher stage, it was temporarily stable—but  

642
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,880
that projector over there that we designed 
for the purpose of holding open electric  

643
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:24,240
and magnetic fields just opened the door 
and let all that power right out again."

644
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,240
"But why isn't it atomic energy?  

645
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,640
How do you know that no more than your power 
that you put in is coming out?" demanded Devin.

646
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,160
"The arc, man, the arc. That was a high-current, 
and low-voltage arc. Couldn't you tell by the  

647
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,800
sound that no great voltage—as atomic voltages 
go—was smashing across there? If we were getting  

648
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,520
atomic voltage—and power—there'd have been 
a different tone to it, high and shriller.

649
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,400
"Now, did you take any readings?"

650
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,240
"What do you think, man? I'm human. Do you 
think I got any readings with that thing  

651
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,440
bellowing and shrieking in my ears, and burning 
my skin with ultra-violet? It itches now."

652
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:14,320
Kendall laughed. "You know what to do for an itch. 
Now, I'm going to make a bet. We had those points  

653
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:20,640
separated for a half-million volts discharge, but 
there was a dust-cover thrown over them just now.  

654
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,880
That, you notice, is missing. I'll bet that 
served as a starter lead for the main arc.  

655
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,360
Now I'm going to start that projector 
thing again, and move the points  

656
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,840
there through about six inches, and 
that thing probably won't start itself."

657
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,560
Most of the laboratory staff 
had collected at the doorway,  

658
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:46,080
looking in at the white-hot tungsten discharge 
points, and the now silent "atomic engine."  

659
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,640
Kendall turned to them and said: "The 
flop picked itself up. You go on back,  

660
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,360
we seem to be all in one piece yet. Douglass, 
you didn't get any readings, did you?"

661
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:06,160
Sheepishly, Douglass grinned at him. "Eh—er—no—but 
I tore my pants. The magnetic field grabbed me and  

662
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,640
I jumped. They had some steel buttons, and a lot 
of steel keys—they're kinda' hard to keep on now."

663
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,920
The laboratory staff broke into 
a roar of laughter, as Douglass,  

664
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,880
holding up his trousers 
with both hands was beheld.

665
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,640
"I guess the field worked," he said.

666
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:32,320
"I guess maybe it did," adjudged Kendall 
solemnly. "We have some rope here if you need it—"

667
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,920
Douglass returned to his post.

668
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,800
Swiftly, Kendall altered the atomic 
distortion storage apparatus,  

669
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,440
and returned to the power-board. "Ready?"

670
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:42,720
"Check."

671
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,720
Kendall shoved home the switch. The storage 
device was silent. Only a slight feeling of  

672
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:56,240
strain made itself felt, and the sudden 
noisy hum of a small transformer nearby.  

673
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,360
"She works, Buck!" Devin called. 
"The readings check almost exactly."

674
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,440
"All good then. Now I want 
to get to that atomic thing.  

675
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,640
We can let that slide for a 
little bit—I'll answer it."

676
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,680
The telephone had rung noisily. 
"Kendall Labs—Kendall speaking."

677
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,640
"This is Superintendent Foster, of 
the New York Power, Mr. Kendall.  

678
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,080
We have some trouble just now that we think 
your operations may be responsible for.  

679
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,520
The sub-station at North Beaumont blew all the 
fuses, and threw the breakers at the main station.  

680
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,760
The men out there said the 
transformers began howling—"

681
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,400
"Right you are—I'm afraid I did do that.  

682
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,440
I had no idea that it would reach so 
far. How far is that from my place here?"

683
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,160
"It's about a thousand yards, 
according to the survey maps."

684
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,160
"Thanks—and I'll be careful about it. Any 
damage, I am responsible for? All okay?"

685
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,880
"Yes, sir, Mr. Kendall."

686
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,400
Kendall hung up. "We stirred up a lot 
more dust than we expected, Devin.  

687
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,440
Now let's start seeing if we can keep track 
of it. Douglass, how did your readings show?"

688
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,480
"I took them at the ten stations, and here 
they are. The stations are two feet apart."

689
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:31,760
"H-m-m—.5—.55—.6—.7—20—198—5950—6010—6012—5920. 
Very, very nice—only the darned thing's got  

690
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:36,160
an arm as long as the law. Your 
readings were about .2, Devin?"

691
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,000
"That's right."

692
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,240
"Then these little readings are just 
leakage. What's our normal intensity here?"

693
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,520
"About .19. Just a very small 
fraction less than the readings."

694
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:55,200
"Perfect—we have what amounts to a hollow 
shell of magnetic force—we can move inside,  

695
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,800
and you can move outside—far enough. But you can't 
get a conductor or a magnetic field through it."  

696
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,160
He put the readings on the bench, and 
looked at the apparatus across the room.  

697
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:11,840
"Now I want to start right on that other. 
Douglass, you move that magnetostat apparatus  

698
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,440
out of the way, and leave just the 
'can-opener' of ours—the projector.  

699
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,760
I'm pretty sure that's what does the deed. 
Devin, see if you can hunt up some electrostatic  

700
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:26,160
voltmeters with a range in the neighborhood 
of—I think it'll be about eighty thousand."

701
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,160
Rapidly, Douglass was dismounting the 
apparatus, as Devin started for the stock room.  

702
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,840
Kendall started making some new connections, 
reconnecting the apparatus they had intended  

703
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,080
using on the "atomic engine," 
largely high-capacity resistances.  

704
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:49,840
He seemed to perform this work mechanically, 
his mind definitely on something else. Suddenly  

705
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,880
he stopped, and looked carefully 
into the receiver of the machine.  

706
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:00,320
The metal in it was silvery, liquid, and here and 
there a floating crystal of the dull red metal.  

707
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,520
Slowly a smile spread across 
his face. He turned to Douglass.

708
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,080
"Douglass—ah, you're through. Get on the trail of 
MacBride, and get him and his crew to work making  

709
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:17,600
half a dozen smaller things like this. Tell 
'em they can leave off the tungsten shield.  

710
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,800
I want different metals in the receiver of each. 
Use—hmmm—sodium—copper—magnesium—aluminium,  

711
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,480
iron and chromium. Got it?"

712
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,280
"Yes, sir." He left, just as Devin returned 
with a large electrostatic voltmeter.

713
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,240
"I'd like," said he, "to know how you know the 
voltage will range around eighty thousand."

714
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:48,320
"K-ring excitation potential for mercury. I'm 
willing to bet that thing simply shoved the whole  

715
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,400
electron system of the mercury out a notch—that 
it simply hasn't any K-ring of electrons now.  

716
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,240
I'm trying some other metals. Douglass is going to 
have MacBride make up half a dozen more machines.  

717
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,040
Machines—they need a name. 
This—ah—this is an 'atostor.'  

718
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,720
MacBride's going to make up half a dozen of 
'em, and try half a dozen metals. I'm almost  

719
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:18,640
certain that's not mercury in there now, at all. 
It's probably element 99 or something like it."

720
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,960
"It looks like mercury—"

721
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:29,040
"Certainly. So would 99. Following the periodic 
table, 99 would probably have an even lower  

722
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,880
melting point than mercury, be silvery, dense 
and heavy—and perhaps slightly radioactive.  

723
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:41,680
The series under the B family of Group II 
is Magnesium, Zinc, Cadmium, Mercury—and 99.  

724
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:48,000
The melting point is going down all the 
way, and they're all silvery metals. I'm  

725
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,840
going to try copper, and I fully expect it 
to turn silvery—in fact, to become silver."

726
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,600
"Then let's see." Swiftly they hooked up 
the apparatus, realigned the projector,  

727
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,720
and again Kendall took his place at the 
power-board. As he closed the switch, on  

728
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:11,600
no-load, the electrostatic voltmeter flopped over 
instantly, and steadied at just over 80,000 volts.

729
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,120
"I hate to say 'I told you so,'" said 
Kendall. "But let's hook in a load.  

730
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,000
Try it on about 100 amps first."

731
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,360
Devin began cutting in load. The resistors 
began heating up swiftly as more and more  

732
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,280
current flowed through them. By not so much 
as by a vibration of the voltmeter needle,  

733
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:43,440
did the apparatus betray any strain as the load 
mounted swiftly. 100—200—500—1000 amperes. Still,  

734
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:49,680
that needle held steady. Finally, with a drain of 
ten thousand amperes, all the equipment available  

735
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:55,600
could handle, the needle was steady as a rock, 
though the tremendous load of 800,000,000 watts  

736
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:03,840
was cut in and out. That, to atoms, atoms by 
the nonillions, was no appreciable load at all.  

737
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:12,320
There was no internal resistance whatever. The 
perfect accumulator had certainly been discovered.

738
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,320
"I'll have to call McLaurin—" Kendall 
hurried away with a broad, broad smile.

739
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,080
"Hello, Tom?"

740
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,920
The telephone rattled in a peeved sort of way.  

741
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,000
"Yes, it is. What now? And when am I going 
to see you in a social sort of way again?"

742
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,200
"Not for a long, long time; I'm busy. I'm busy 
right now as a matter of fact. I'm calling up the  

743
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,840
vice-president of Faragaut Interplanetary 
Lines, and I want to place an order."

744
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,080
"Why bother me? We have clerks, 
you know, for that sort of thing,"  

745
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,240
suggested Faragaut in a pained voice.

746
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,680
"Tom, do you know how much I'm worth now?"

747
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,400
"Not much," replied Faragaut promptly. "What 
of it? I hear, as a matter of fact that you're  

748
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,200
worth even less in a business way. They're 
talking quite a lot down this way about an  

749
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:26,480
alleged bank you're setting up on Luna. 
I hear it's got more protective devices,  

750
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:32,400
and armor than any IP station in the System, 
that you even had it designed by an IP designer,  

751
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,520
and have a gang of Colonels and Generals in 
charge. I also hear that you've succeeded in  

752
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,240
getting rid of money at about one million 
dollars a day—just slightly shy of that."

753
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:49,040
"You overestimate me, my friend. Much of 
that is merely contracted for. Actually  

754
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:53,360
it'll take me nearly nine months to get 
rid of it. And by that time I'll have more.  

755
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,840
Anyway, I think I have 
something like ten million left.  

756
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,280
And remember that way back in the twentieth 
century some old fellow beat my record.  

757
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,840
Armour, I think it was, lost a million 
dollars a day for a couple of months running.

758
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,040
"Anyway, what I called you up 
for was to say I'd like to order  

759
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:17,200
five hundred thousand tons of mercury, 
for delivery as soon as possible."

760
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,280
"What! Oh, say, I thought you were going in for 
business." Faragaut gave a slight laugh of relief.

761
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:35,840
"Tom, I am. I mean exactly what I say. I want 
five—hundred—thousand—tons of metallic mercury,  

762
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,840
and just as soon as you can get it."

763
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,440
"Man, there isn't that much in the system."

764
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,760
"I know it. Get all there is on the market 
for me, and contract to take all the 'Jupiter  

765
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,600
Heavy-Metals' can turn out. You send those orders 
through, and clean out the market completely.  

766
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,360
Somebody's about to pay for the 
work I've been doing, and boy,  

767
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,080
they're going to pay through the nose. After 
you've got that order launched, and don't make  

768
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:07,280
a christening party of the launching either, 
why just drop out here, and I'll show you  

769
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:12,800
why the value of mercury is going so high you 
won't be able to follow it in a space ship."

770
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:20,480
"The cost of that," said Faragaut, seriously 
now, "will be about—fifty-three million at the  

771
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:25,280
market price. You'd have to put up twenty-six 
cash, and I don't believe you've got it."

772
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,000
Buck laughed. "Tom, loan me 
a dozen million, will you?  

773
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:35,120
You send that order through, and then 
come see what I've got. I've got a break,  

774
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:41,040
too! Mercury's the best metal for this 
use—and it'll stop gamma rays too!"

775
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,200
"So it will—but for the love 
of the system, what of it?"

776
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,760
"Come and see—tonight. Will 
you send that order through?"

777
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,560
"I will, Buck. I hope you're 
right. Cash is tight now,  

778
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,440
and I'll probably have to 
put up nearer twenty million,  

779
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,840
when all that buying goes through. How long 
will it be tied up in that deal, do you think?"

780
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,880
"Not over three weeks. And I'll guarantee you 
three hundred percent—if you'll stay in with  

781
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,320
me after you start. Otherwise—I don't think 
making this money would be fair just now."

782
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,360
"I'll be out to see you in about 
two hours, Buck. Where are you?  

783
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,680
At the estate?" asked Faragaut seriously.

784
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,640
"In my lab out there. Thanks, Tom."

785
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:32,880
McLaurin was there when Tom Faragaut arrived. 
And General Logan, and Colonel Gerardhi. There  

786
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:38,640
was a restrained air of gratefulness about all of 
them that Tom Faragaut couldn't quite understand.  

787
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,400
He had been looking up Buck Kendall's famous 
bank, and more and more he had begun to wonder  

788
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:51,040
just what was up. The list of stockholders had 
read like a list of IP heroes and executives.  

789
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:58,000
The staff had been a list of IP men with a slender 
sprinkling of accountants. And the sixty-million  

790
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,080
dollar structure was to be a bank without 
advertising of any sort! Usually such a venture  

791
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,400
is planned and published months in advance. This 
had sprung up suddenly, with a strange quietness.

792
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,200
Almost silently, Buck Kendall 
led the way to the laboratory.  

793
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,800
A small metal tank was supported in a 
peculiar piece of apparatus, and from  

794
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:28,880
it led a small platinum pipe to a domed apparatus 
made largely of insulum. A little pool of mercury,  

795
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:35,120
with small red crystals floating in it rested in 
a shallow hollow surrounded by heavy conductors.

796
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,880
"That's it, Tom. I wanted to show you first what 
we have, and why I wanted all that mercury. Within  

797
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,600
three weeks, every man, woman and child in the 
system will be clamoring for mercury metal. That's  

798
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:56,320
the perfect accumulator." Quickly he demonstrated 
the machine, charging it, and then discharging it.  

799
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:04,560
It was better than 99.95% efficient on the 
charge, and was 100% efficient on the discharge.

800
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,040
"Physically, any metal will do. Technically, 
mercury is best for a number of reasons.  

801
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,160
It's a liquid. I can, and do it in 
this, charge a certain quantity,  

802
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:20,720
and then move it up to the storage tank. 
Charge another pool, and move it up.  

803
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:27,200
In discharge, I can let a stream flow in 
continuously if I required a steady, terrific  

804
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:33,760
drain of power without interruption. If I wanted 
it for more normal service, I'd discharge a pool,  

805
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:40,560
drain it, refill the receiver, and discharge a 
second pool. Thus, mercury is the metal to use.

806
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,440
"Do you see why I wanted all that metal?"

807
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:51,200
"I do, Buck—Lord, I do," gasped Faragaut. 
"That is the perfect power supply."

808
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:59,200
"No, confound it, it isn't. It's a secondary 
source. It isn't primary. We're just as limited  

809
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:05,360
in the supply of power as ever—only we have 
increased our distribution of power. Lord knows,  

810
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:12,080
we're going to need a power supply badly enough 
before long—" Buck relapsed into moody silence.

811
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,640
"What," asked Faragaut, looking 
around him, "does that mean?"

812
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,040
It was McLaurin who told him of the stranger 
ship, and Kendall's interpretation of its meaning.  

813
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,200
Slowly Faragaut grasped the meaning behind 
Buck's strange actions of the past months.

814
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:38,480
"The Lunar Bank," he said slowly, half to himself. 
"Staffed by trained IP men, experts in expert  

815
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:44,000
destruction. Buck, you said something about the 
profits of this venture. What did you mean?"

816
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Buck smiled. "We're going to stick up IP to the 
extent necessary to pay for that fort—er—bank—on  

817
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,280
Luna. We'll also boost the price 
so that we'll make enough to pay  

818
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,560
for those ships I'm having made. 
The public will pay for that."

819
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,680
"I see. And we aren't to stick the 
price too high, and just make money?"

820
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,920
"That's the general idea."

821
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,320
"The IP Appropriations Board 
won't give you what you need,  

822
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,800
Commander, for real improvements on the IP ships?"

823
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,320
"They won't believe Kendall. 
Therefore they won't."

824
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,440
"What did you mean about gamma rays, Buck?"

825
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:27,280
"Mercury will stop them and the Commander 
here intends to have the refitted ships built  

826
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:33,120
so that the engine room and control room are one, 
and completely surrounded by the mercury tanks.  

827
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,080
The men will be protected against the gamma rays."

828
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,840
"Won't the rays affect the power stored 
in the mercury—perhaps release it?"

829
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,280
"We tried it out, of course, and while 
we can't get the intensities we expect,  

830
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,600
and can't really make any measurements of the 
gamma-ray energy impinging on the mercury—it  

831
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,000
seems to absorb, and store that energy!"

832
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,520
"What's next on the program, Buck?"

833
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,280
"Finish those ships I have building. And 
I want to do some more development work.  

834
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,600
The Stranger will return within 
six months now, I believe.  

835
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,160
It will take all that time, and more 
for real refitting of the IP ships."

836
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:19,040
"How about more forts—or banks, whichever 
you want to call them. Mars isn't protected."

837
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,400
"Mars is abandoned," replied 
General Logan seriously. "We  

838
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,760
haven't any too much to protect 
old Earth, and she must come first.  

839
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:34,720
Mars will, of course, be protected as best 
the IP ships can. But—we're expecting defeat.  

840
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:42,000
This isn't a case of glorious victory. It will 
be a case of hard won survival. We don't know  

841
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,280
anything about the enemy—except that they are 
capable of interstellar flights, and have atomic  

842
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:54,240
energy. They are evidently far ahead of us. Our 
battle is to survive till we learn how to conquer.  

843
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,680
For a time, at least, the Strangers will have 
possession of most of the planets of the system.  

844
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,000
We do not think they will be able to reach Earth, 
because Commander McLaurin here will withdraw his  

845
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,080
ships to Earth to protect the planet—and the great 
'Lunar Bank' will display its true character."

846
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,240
Faragaut looked unsympathetically at Buck Kendall,  

847
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,240
as he stood glaring perplexedly at 
the apparatus he had been working on.

848
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,520
"What's the matter, Buck, won't she perk?"

849
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,240
"No, damn it, and it should."

850
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:52,560
"That," pointed out Faragaut, "is just 
what you think. Nature thinks otherwise.  

851
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:57,760
We generally have to abide by her opinions. 
What is it—or what is it meant to be?"

852
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,240
"Perfect reflector."

853
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,160
"Make a nice mirror. What else, and how come?"

854
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:11,040
"A mirror is just what I want. I 
want something that will reflect  

855
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:17,280
all the radiation that falls on it. No metal 
will, even in its range of maximum reflectivity.  

856
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:25,120
Aluminum goes pretty high, silver, on some ranges, 
a bit higher. But none of them reaches 99%.  

857
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,320
I want a perfect reflector that I 
can put behind a source of wild,  

858
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:34,720
radiant energy so I can focus it, and 
put it where it will do the most good."

859
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,960
"Ninety-nine percent. Sounds pretty good.  

860
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,920
That's better efficiency than most 
anything else we have, isn't it?"

861
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:51,360
"No, it isn't. The accumulator is 100% efficient 
on the discharge, and a good transformer,  

862
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:58,720
even before that, ran as high as 99.8 sometimes. 
They had to. If you have a transformer handling  

863
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:04,880
1,000,000 horsepower, and it's even 1% 
inefficient, you have a heat loss of nearly  

864
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,360
10,000 horsepower to handle. I want to use 
this as a destructive weapon, and if I hand  

865
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,720
the other fellow energy in distressing amounts, 
it's even worse at my end, because no matter how  

866
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:23,200
perfect a beam I work out, there will still be 
some spread. I can make it mighty tight though,  

867
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:30,480
if I make my surface a perfect parabola. But 
if I send a million horse, I have to handle it,  

868
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,640
and a ship can't stand several hundred 
thousand horsepower roaming around  

869
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:40,240
loose as heat, let alone the weapon itself. 
The thing will be worse to me than to him.

870
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:46,000
"I figured there was something worth investigating 
in those fields we developed on our magnetic  

871
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,160
shield work. They had to do, you know, with 
light, and radiant energy. There must be some  

872
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:58,080
reason why a metal reflects. Further, though 
we can't get down to the basic root of matter,  

873
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:03,600
the atom, yet, we can play around just about as 
we please with molecules and molecular forces.  

874
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,720
But it is molecular force that determines whether 
light and radiant energy of that caliber shall  

875
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:18,160
be reflected or transmitted. Take aluminum as an 
example. In the metallic molecule state, the metal  

876
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:26,000
will reflect pretty well. But volatilize it, and 
it becomes transparent. All gases are transparent,  

877
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,320
all metals reflective. Then the secret of perfect 
reflection lies at a molecular level in the  

878
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:39,520
organization of matter, and is within our reach. 
Well—this thing was supposed to make that piece  

879
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:46,000
of silver reflective. I missed it that time." 
He sighed. "I suppose I'll have to try again."

880
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,240
"I should think you'd use tungsten for that.  

881
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,920
If you do have a slight leak, 
that would handle the heat."

882
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,040
"No, it would hold it. Silver 
is a better conductor of heat.  

883
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,760
But the darned thing won't work."

884
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,240
"Your other scheme has." Faragaut laughed. 
"I came out principally for some signatures.  

885
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,000
IP wants one hundred thousand tons of mercury.  

886
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,680
I've sold most of mine already in 
the open market. You want to sell?"

887
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,720
"Certainly. And I told you my price."

888
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:27,040
"I know," sighed Faragaut. "It seems a shame 
though. Those IP board men would pay higher.  

889
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:32,160
And they're so damn tight it seems a crime 
not to make 'em pay up when they have to."

890
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,680
"The IP will need the money worse 
elsewhere. Where do I—oh, here?"

891
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,760
"Right. I'll be out again this evening. 
The regular group will be here?"

892
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,840
Kendall nodded as he signed in triplicate.

893
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,080
That evening, Buck had found 
the trouble in his apparatus,  

894
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:56,640
for as he well knew, the theory was right, only 
the practical apparatus needed changing. Before  

895
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,160
the group composed of Faragaut, McLaurin and the 
members of Kendall's "bank," he demonstrated it.

896
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It was merely a small, model apparatus, with 
a mirror of space-strained silver that was an  

897
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,480
absolutely perfect reflector. The mirror had been 
ground out of a block of silver one foot deep,  

898
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:23,440
by four inches square, carefully annealed, and 
the work had all been done in a cooling bath. The  

899
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:30,400
result was a mirror that was so nearly a perfect 
paraboloid that the beam held sharp and absolutely  

900
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,560
tight for the half-mile range they tested it 
on. At the projector it was three and one-half  

901
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:41,840
inches in diameter. At the target, it was three 
and fifty-two one hundredths inches in diameter.

902
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,880
"Well, you've got the mirror, what 
are you going to reflect with it now?"  

903
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,800
asked McLaurin. "The greatest problem is 
getting a radiant source, isn't it? You  

904
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,360
can't get a temperature above about ten thousand 
degrees, and maintain it very long, can you?"

905
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,880
"Why not?" Kendall smiled.

906
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,400
"It'll volatilize and leave 
the scene of action, won't it?"

907
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,000
"What if it's a gaseous source already?"

908
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:16,560
"What? Just a gas-flame? That won't give you 
the point source you need. You're using just  

909
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:23,120
a spotlight here, with a Moregan Point-light. That 
won't give you energy, and if you use a gas-flame,  

910
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:28,080
the spread will be so great, that no matter how 
perfectly you figure your mirror, it won't beam."

911
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:33,760
"The answer is easy. Not an ordinary gas-flame—a  

912
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:41,120
very extra-special kind of gas-flame. Know 
anything about Renwright's ionization-work?"

913
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,640
"Renwright—he's an IP man isn't he?"

914
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:51,840
"Right. He's developed a system, which, thanks 
to the power we can get in that atostor,  

915
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,720
will sextuply ionize oxygen 
gas. Now: what does that mean?"

916
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:03,200
"Spirits of space! Concentrated 
essence of energy!"

917
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,720
"Right. And in preparation, Cole 
here had one made up for me.  

918
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,480
That—and something else. We'll just hook it up—"

919
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,080
With Devin's aid, Kendall 
attached the second apparatus,  

920
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,080
a larger device into which the silver 
block with its mirror surface fitted.  

921
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:29,760
With the uttermost care, the two physicists lined 
it up. Two projectors pointed toward each other  

922
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,880
at an angle, the base angles of a triangle, 
whose apex was the center of the mirror.  

923
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,360
On very low power, a soft, glowing violet light 
filtered out through the opening of the one,  

924
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:48,080
and a slight green light came from the other. 
But where the two streams met, an intense,  

925
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:54,560
violet glare built up. The center of action was 
not at the focus, and slowly this was lined up,  

926
01:30:54,560 --> 01:31:00,240
till a sharp, violet beam of light reached 
out across the open yard to the target set up.

927
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,040
Buck Kendall cut off the power, 
and slowly got into position.  

928
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:13,120
"Now. Keep out from in front of that thing. Put on 
these glasses—and watch out." Heavy, thick-lensed  

929
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:19,680
orange-brown goggles were passed out, and Kendall 
took his place. Before him, a thick window of  

930
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,040
the same glass had been arranged, so that he 
might see uninterruptedly the controls at hand,  

931
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,240
and yet watch unblinded, the action of the beam.

932
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:36,000
Dully the mirror-force relay clicked. A hazy 
glow ran over the silver block, and died.  

933
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:44,880
Then—simultaneously the power was thrown from two 
small, compact atostors into the twin projectors.  

934
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:53,120
Instantly—a titanic eruption of light almost 
invisibly violet, spurted out in a solid, compact  

935
01:31:53,120 --> 01:32:00,160
stream. With a roar and crash, it battered its way 
through the thick air, and crashed into the heavy  

936
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:05,920
target plate. A stream of flame and scintillating 
sparks erupted from the armor plate—and  

937
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:13,840
died as Kendall cut the beam. A white-hot area 
a foot across leaked down the face of the metal.

938
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,320
"That," said Faragaut 
gently, removing his goggles.  

939
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,400
"That's not a spotlight, and it's not exactly 
a gas-flame. But I still don't know what that  

940
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:30,240
blue-hot needle of destruction is. Just what do 
you call that tame stellar furnace of yours?"

941
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,960
"Not so far off, Tom," said Kendall happily, 
"except that even S Doradus is cold compared  

942
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:44,560
to that. That sends almost pure ultra-violet 
light—which, by the way, it is almost impossible  

943
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,680
to reflect successfully, and represents a 
temperature to be expressed not in thousands  

944
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:55,680
of degrees, nor yet in tens of thousands. 
I calculated the temperature would be about  

945
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:03,040
750,000 degrees. What is happening is that 
a stream of low-voltage electrons—cathode  

946
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:09,440
rays—in great quantity are meeting great 
quantities of sextuply ionized oxygen.  

947
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:15,760
That means that a nucleus used to having two 
electrons in the K-ring, and six in the next,  

948
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,840
has had that outer six knocked off, and then 
has been hurled violently into free air.

949
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:30,960
"All by themselves, those sextuply ionized oxygen 
atoms would have a good bit to say, but they don't  

950
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,800
really begin to talk till they start roaring for 
those electrons I'm feeding them. At the meeting  

951
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:43,440
point, they grab up all they can get—probably 
about five—before the competition and the fierce  

952
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:50,080
release of energy drives them out, part-satisfied. 
I lose a little energy there, but not a real  

953
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:57,360
fraction. It's the howl they put up for the first 
four that counts. The electron-feed is necessary,  

954
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:04,240
because otherwise they'd smash on and ruin that 
mirror. They work practically in a perfect vacuum.  

955
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:09,760
That beam smashes the air out of the way. 
Of course, in space it would work better."

956
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,920
"How could it?" asked Faragaut, faintly.

957
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,360
"Kendall," asked McLaurin, "can 
we install that in the IP ships?"

958
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:25,280
"You can start." Kendall shrugged. "There 
isn't a lot of apparatus. I'm going to  

959
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,480
install them in my ships, and in the—bank. 
I suspect—we haven't a lot of time left."

960
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,200
"How near ready are those ships?"

961
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:40,720
"About. That's all I can say. They've been torn up 
a bit for installation of the atostor apparatus.  

962
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,240
Now they'll have to be changed again."

963
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,480
"Anything more coming?"

964
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:54,720
Buck smiled slowly. He turned directly to 
McLaurin and replied: "Yes—the Strangers. As to  

965
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:01,520
developments—I can't tell, naturally. But if they 
do, it will be something entirely unexpected now.  

966
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,800
You see, given one new discovery, a 
half-dozen will follow immediately from it.  

967
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,880
When we announced that atostor, look what 
happened. Renwright must have thought it was God's  

968
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:18,720
gift to suffering physicists. He stuck some oxygen 
in the thing, added some of his own stuff—and  

969
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:25,920
behold. The magnetic apparatus gave us directly 
the shield, and indirectly this mirror. Now,  

970
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:31,280
I seem to have reached the end for the time. I'm 
still trying to get that space-release for high  

971
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:39,040
speed—speed greater than light, that is. So far," 
he added bitterly, "all I've gotten as an answer  

972
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,720
is a single expression that simply means practical 
zero—Heisenberg's Uncertainty Expression."

973
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,480
"I'm uncertain as to your meaning"—McLaurin 
smiled—"but I take it that's nothing new."

974
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:57,680
"No. Nearly four centuries old—twentieth 
century physics. I'll have to try some other  

975
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:05,040
line of attack, I guess, but that did seem so 
darned right. It just sounded right. Something  

976
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:10,560
ought to happen—and it just keeps saying 'nothing 
more except the natural uncertainty of nature.'"

977
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,240
"Try it out, your math might be wrong somewhere."

978
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,800
Kendall laughed. "If it 
was—I'd hate to try it out.  

979
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:24,800
If it wasn't I'd have no reason to. And there's 
plenty of other work to do. For one thing,  

980
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,760
getting that apparatus in production. The 
IP board won't like me." Kendall smiled.

981
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:37,040
"They don't," replied McLaurin. "They're getting 
more and more and more worried—but they've got  

982
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:42,080
to keep the IP fleet in such condition that it 
can at least catch an up-to-date freighter."

983
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,800
Gresth Gkae looked back at 
Sthor rapidly dropping behind,  

984
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,640
and across at her sister world, Asthor, 
circling a bare 100,000 miles away.  

985
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,640
Behind his great interstellar cruiser 
came a long line of similar ships.  

986
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:08,000
Each was loaded now not with instruments and pure 
scientists, but with weapons, fuel and warriors.  

987
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:16,640
Colonists too, came in the last ships. One hundred 
and fifty giant ships. All the wealth of Sthor and  

988
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:23,200
Asthor had been concentrated in producing those 
great machines. Every one represented nearly the  

989
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,520
equivalent of thirty million Earth-dollars. Four 
and a half billions of dollars for mere materials.

990
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:36,400
Gresth Gkae had the honor of lead position, for 
he had discovered the planets and their stable,  

991
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:43,280
though tiny, sun. Still, Gresth Gkae knew 
his own giant Mira was a super-giant sun—and  

992
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:50,480
a curse and a menace to any rational 
society. Our yellow-white sun (to his eyes,  

993
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:56,880
an almost invisible color, similar to our 
blue) was small, but stable, and warm enough.

994
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:04,880
In half an hour, all the ships were in space, and 
at a given signal, at ten-second intervals, they  

995
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:12,800
sprang into the superspeed, faster than light. For 
an instant, giant Mira ran and seemed distorted,  

996
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:18,880
as though seen through a porthole covered with 
running water, then steadied, curiously distorted.  

997
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,960
Faster than light they raced across the galaxy.

998
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:30,560
Even in their super-fast ships, nearly three and 
a half weeks passed before the sun they sought,  

999
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,760
singled itself from the star-field as 
an extra bright point. Two days more,  

1000
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:42,080
and the sun was within planetary distance. They 
came at an angle to the plane of the ecliptic, but  

1001
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:50,080
they leveled down to it now, and slanted toward 
giant Jupiter and Jovian worlds. Ten worlds, in  

1002
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:57,840
one sweep, it was—four habitable worlds. The nine 
satellites would be converted into forts at once,  

1003
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,080
nine space-sweeping forts guarding 
the approaches to the planet.  

1004
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:07,280
Gresth Gkae had made a fairly 
good search of the worlds,  

1005
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:12,240
and knew that Earth was the main home of 
civilization in this system. Mars was second,  

1006
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:18,800
and Venus third. But Jupiter offered the greatest 
possibilities for quick settlement, a base from  

1007
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,920
which they could more easily operate, a base for 
fuels, for the heavy elements they would need—

1008
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:29,920
Fifteen million miles from Jupiter they 
slowed below the speed of light—and the  

1009
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,480
IP stations observed them. Instantly, according 
to instructions issued by Commander McLaurin,  

1010
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:43,200
a fleet of ten of the tiniest, fastest 
scouts darted out. As soon as possible,  

1011
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:48,320
a group of three heavy cruisers, armed with 
all the inventions that had been discovered,  

1012
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:54,800
the atostor power system, perfectly conducting 
power leads, the terrible UV ray, started out.

1013
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,320
The scouts got there first. Cameras were grinding 
steadily, with long range telescopic lenses,  

1014
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:07,840
delicate instruments probed and felt and caught 
their fingers in the fields of the giant fleet.

1015
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:15,120
At ten-second intervals, giant ships popped 
into being, and glided smoothly toward Jupiter.

1016
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:23,200
Then the cruisers arrived. They halted at a 
respectful distance, and waited. The Miran  

1017
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:30,720
ships plowed on undisturbed. Simultaneously, from 
the three leaders, terrific neutron rays shot out.  

1018
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:37,040
The paraffin block walls stopped those—and the 
cruisers started to explain their feelings on  

1019
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:46,800
the subject. They were the IP-J-37, 39, and 42. 
The 37 turned up the full power of the UV ray.  

1020
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:52,000
The terrific beam of ultra-violet 
energy struck the second Miran ship,  

1021
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,480
and the spot it touched exploded 
into incandescence, burned  

1022
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:01,760
white-hot—and puffed out abruptly as the air 
pressure within blew the molten metal away.

1023
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:10,240
The Mirans were startled. This was not the type 
of thing Gresth Gkae had warned them of. Gresth  

1024
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:15,360
Gkae himself frowned as the sudden roar of the 
machines of his ship rose in the metal walls.  

1025
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:22,480
A stream of ten-inch atomic bombs shrieked out of 
their tubes, fully glowing green things floated  

1026
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:29,040
out more slowly, and immediately waxed brilliant. 
Gamma ray bombs—but they could be guarded against—

1027
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:35,040
The three Solarian cruisers were washed 
in such frightful flame as they had never  

1028
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:41,760
imagined. Streams of atomic bombs were 
exploding soundlessly, ineffectively in space,  

1029
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,080
not thirty feet from them as they felt the 
sudden resistance of the magnetic shields.  

1030
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:52,560
Hopefully, the 39 probed with her neutron 
gun. Nothing happened save that several  

1031
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:57,760
gamma ray bombs went off explosively, and all 
the atomic bombs in its path exploded at once.

1032
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,200
Gresth Gkae knew what that meant. Neutron beam  

1033
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,520
guns. Then this race was more 
intelligent than he had believed.  

1034
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:13,840
They had not had them before. Had he perhaps 
given them too much warning and information?

1035
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:21,920
There was a sudden, deeper note in the thrumming 
roar of the great ship. Eagerly Gresth Gkae  

1036
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:27,840
watched—and sighed in relief. The nearer of 
the three enemy ships was crumbling to dust.  

1037
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:35,440
Now the other two were beginning to become blurred 
of outline. They were fleeing—but oh, so slowly.  

1038
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:41,840
Easily the greater ship chased them down, till 
only floating dust, and a few small pieces of—

1039
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:47,600
Gresth Gkae shrieked in pain, and 
horror. The destroyed ships had fought  

1040
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:54,160
in dying. All space seemed to blossom out with a 
terrible light, a light that wrapped around them,  

1041
01:42:54,160 --> 01:43:00,480
and burned into him, and through him. His eyes 
were dark and burning lumps in his head, his flesh  

1042
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:08,000
seemed crawling, stinging—he was being flayed 
alive—in shrieking agony he crumpled to the floor.

1043
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:15,520
Hospital attachés came to him, and injected 
drugs. Slowly torturing consciousness left him.  

1044
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,840
The doctors began working 
over his horribly burned body,  

1045
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,000
shuddering inwardly as the protective, 
feather-like covering of his skin loosened,  

1046
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,880
and dropped from his body. Tenderly they 
lowered him into a bath of chemicals—

1047
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:37,280
"The terrible light which caused so much damage 
to our men," reported a physicist, "was analyzed,  

1048
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:44,400
and found to have some extraordinary lines. It was 
largely mercury-vapor spectrum, but the spectrum  

1049
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:50,480
of mercury-atoms in an impossibly strained 
condition. I would suggest that great care  

1050
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:55,760
be used hereafter, and all men be equipped with 
protective masks when observations are needed.  

1051
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:02,720
This sun is very rich in the infra-X-rays and 
ultra-visible light. The explosion of light, we  

1052
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:09,280
witnessed, was dangerous in its consisting almost 
wholly of very short and hard infra-X-rays."

1053
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,120
The physicist had a special term for what 
we know as ultra-violet light. To him,  

1054
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:22,800
blue was ultra-violet, and exceedingly 
dangerous to red-sensitive eyes. To him,  

1055
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:29,680
our ultra-violet was a long X-ray, and was 
designated by a special term. And to him—the  

1056
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:35,840
explosion of the atostor reservoirs 
was a terrible and mystifying calamity.

1057
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:40,560
To the men in the five tiny 
scout-ships, it was also a surprise,  

1058
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:47,520
and a painful one. Even space-hardened humans 
were burned by the terrifically hard ultra-violet  

1059
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:53,200
from the explosion. But they got some 
hint of what it had meant to the Mirans  

1060
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:58,160
from the confusion that resulted in the 
fleet. Several of the nearer ships spun,  

1061
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:03,600
twisted, and went erratically off their 
courses. All seemed uncontrolled momentarily.

1062
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,120
The five scouts, following orders, 
darted instantly toward the Lunar Bank.  

1063
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,840
Why, they did not know. But those 
were orders. They were to land there.

1064
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,720
The reason was that, faster 
than any Solarian ship,  

1065
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:24,240
radio signals had reached McLaurin, and he, and 
most of the staff of the IP service had been moved  

1066
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:31,680
to the Lunar Bank. Buck Kendall had extended an 
invitation in this "unexpected emergency." It  

1067
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:36,800
so happened that Buck Kendall's invitation got 
there before any description of the Strangers,  

1068
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,320
or their actions had arrived. The staff was 
somewhat puzzled as to how this happened—

1069
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,160
And now for the satellites of great Jupiter.

1070
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,200
One hundred and fifty giant interstellar 
cruisers advanced on Callisto.  

1071
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
They didn't pause to investigate the mines 
and scattered farms of the satellite,  

1072
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,040
but ten great ships settled, and a 
horde of warriors began pouring out.

1073
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:08,160
One hundred and forty ships reached 
Ganymede. One hundred and thirty sailed on.  

1074
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:13,200
One hundred and thirty ships reached 
Europa—and they sailed on hurriedly,  

1075
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,880
one hundred and twenty-nine of them. 
Gresth Gkae did not know it then,  

1076
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:25,840
but the fleet had lost its first ship. 
The IP station on Europa had spoken back.

1077
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,920
They sailed in, a mighty armada, and 
the first dropped through Europa's thin,  

1078
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:37,840
frozen atmosphere. They spotted the dome of the 
station, and a neutron ray lashed out at it.  

1079
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:45,200
On the other, undefended worlds, this had been 
effective. Here—it was answered by ten five-foot  

1080
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:50,640
UV rays. Further, these men had learned 
something from the destruction of the cruisers,  

1081
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:56,160
and ten torpedoes had been unloaded, reloaded 
with atostor mercury, and sent out bravely.

1082
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,080
Easily the Mirans wiped out the first torpedo—

1083
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:06,720
Shrieking, the Miran pilots clawed their way 
from the controls as the fearful flood of  

1084
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:12,720
ultra-violet light struck their unaccustomed 
skins. Others too felt that burning flood.

1085
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:19,360
The second torpedo they caught and deflected 
on a beam of alternating-current magnetism that  

1086
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:25,760
repelled it. It did not come nearer than half 
a mile to the ship. The third they turned their  

1087
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:32,960
deflecting beam on—and something went strangely 
wrong with the beam. It pulled that torpedo toward  

1088
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:39,120
the ship with a sickening acceleration—and the 
torpedo exploded in that frightful violet flame.

1089
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,240
Five-foot diameter UV beams 
are nothing to play with.  

1090
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,880
The Mirans were dodging these 
now as they loosed atomic bombs,  

1091
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,600
only to see them exploded harmlessly by 
neutron guns, or caught in the magnetic screen.  

1092
01:47:54,480 --> 01:48:00,320
Gamma ray bombs were as useless. Again the 
beam of disintegrating force was turned on—

1093
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:07,520
The present opponent was not a ship. It 
was an IP defense station, equipped with  

1094
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:13,360
everything Solarian science knew, and the dome 
was an eight-foot wall of tungsten-beryllium.  

1095
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:20,160
The eight feet of solid, ultra-resistant alloy 
drank up that crumbling beam, and liked it.  

1096
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:27,040
The wall did not fail. The men inside the 
fort jerked and quivered as the strange beam,  

1097
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:31,760
a small, small fraction of it, 
penetrated the eight feet of outer wall,  

1098
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:35,920
the six feet or so of intervening 
walls, and the mercury atostor reserves.

1099
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:41,520
"Concentrate all those UV beams on one spot, 
and see if you can blast a hole in him before  

1100
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,480
he shakes it loose," ordered the ray technician. 
"He'll wiggle if you start off with the beam.  

1101
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,040
Train your sights on the nose of that 
first ship—when you're ready, call out."

1102
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,680
"Ready—ready—" Ten men replied. 
"Fire!" roared the technician.  

1103
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:05,440
Ten titanic swords of pure ultra-violet energy, 
energy that practically no unconditioned metal  

1104
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:12,880
will reflect to more than fifty per cent, emerged. 
There was a single spot of intense incandescence  

1105
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:18,480
for a single hundredth of a second—and then the 
energy was burning its way through the inner,  

1106
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:23,840
thinner skins with such rapidity that they 
sputtered and flickered like a broken televisor.

1107
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:29,120
One hundred and twenty-nine ships 
retreated hastily for conference,  

1108
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:36,960
leaving a gutted, wrecked hull, broken by its 
fall, on Europa. Triumphantly, the Europa IP  

1109
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:42,960
station hurled out its radio message of the first 
encounter between a fort and the Miran forces.

1110
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,920
Most important of all,  

1111
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,480
it sent a great deal of badly wanted 
information regarding the Miran weapons.  

1112
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:56,880
Particularly interesting was the fact that it had 
withstood the impact of that disintegrating ray.

1113
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:21,200
Grimly Buck Kendall looked at the 
reports. McLaurin stood beside him,  

1114
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:26,160
Devin sat across the table from him. "What do 
you make of it, Buck?" asked the Commander.

1115
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,920
"That we have just one island of 
resistance left on the Jovian worlds.  

1116
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,480
And that will, I fear, vanish. They haven't 
finished with their arsenal by any means."

1117
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,560
"But what was it, man, what was 
it that ruined those ships?"

1118
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:49,200
"Vibration. Somehow—Lord only knows how it's 
done—they can project electric fields. These  

1119
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:53,280
projected fields are oscillated, and they 
are tuned in with some parts of the ship.  

1120
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:59,280
I suspect they are crystals of the metals. If 
they can start a vibration in the crystals of  

1121
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:06,240
the metal—that's fatigue, metal fatigue enormously 
speeded. You know how a quartz crystal oscillator  

1122
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,720
in a radio-control apparatus will break, if 
you work it on a very heavy load at the peak?  

1123
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:17,120
They simply smash the crystals of metal in 
the same way. Only they project their field."

1124
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,880
"Then our toughest metals are useless?  

1125
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:28,080
Can't something tough, rather than hard, like 
copper or even silver for instance, stand it?"

1126
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:32,880
"Calcium metal's the toughest going—and even that 
would break under the beating those ships give it.  

1127
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:37,040
The only way to withstand it 
is to have such a mass of metal  

1128
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,520
that the oscillations are damped out. But—"

1129
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:46,800
The set tuned in on the IP station on Europa 
was speaking again. "The ships are returning.  

1130
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,960
There are one hundred and twenty-nine by accurate 
count. Jorgsen reports that telescopic observation  

1131
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,200
of the dead on the fallen cruiser show 
them to be a completely un-human race!  

1132
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,440
They are of mottled coloring, predominately 
grayish brown. The ships are returning. They  

1133
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:09,760
have divided into ten groups, nine groups of two 
each, and a main body of the rest of the fleet.  

1134
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:15,840
The group of eighteen is descending within 
range, and we are focusing our beams on them—"

1135
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:22,800
Out by Europa, ten great UV beams were stabbing 
angrily toward ten great interstellar ships.  

1136
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:29,600
The metal of the hulls glowed brilliant, and 
distorted slowly as the thick walls softened  

1137
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:36,640
under the heat, and the air behind pressed against 
it. Grimly the ten ships came on. Torpedoes were  

1138
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:44,000
being launched, and exploded, and now they had 
no effect, for the Mirans within were protected.

1139
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,400
The eighteen grouped ships separated, and 
arranged themselves in a circle around the fort.  

1140
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:54,000
Suddenly one staggered as a great puff of 
gas shot out through the thin atmosphere  

1141
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,160
of Europa to flare brilliantly 
in the lash of the stabbing UV  

1142
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:04,560
beam. Instantly the ship righted itself, and 
labored upward. Another dropped to take its place—

1143
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:11,040
And the great walls of the IP fort suddenly 
groaned and started in their welded joints.  

1144
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,400
The faint, whispering rustle of the crumbling 
beam was murmuring through the station.  

1145
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:22,160
Engineers shouted suddenly as meters leapt the 
length of their scales, and the needles clicked  

1146
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:28,720
softly on the stop pins. A thin rustle came from 
the atostors grouped in the great power room.  

1147
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:34,160
"Spirits of Space—a revolving magnetic field!"  

1148
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:39,840
roared the Chief Technician. "They're making 
this whole blasted station a squirrel cage!"

1149
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:48,000
The mighty walls of eight-foot metal shuddered and 
trembled. The UV beams lashed out from the fort in  

1150
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,440
quivering arcs now, they did not hold their aim 
steady, and the magnetic shield that protected  

1151
01:53:53,440 --> 01:54:00,240
them from atomic bombs was working and straining 
wildly. Eighteen great ships quivered and tugged  

1152
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:06,640
outside there now, straining with all their power 
to remain in the same spot, as they passed on from  

1153
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:13,040
one to another the magnetic impulses that were now 
creating a titanic magnetic vortex about the fort.

1154
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:19,520
"The atostors will be exhausted in another 
fifteen minutes," the Chief Technician roared  

1155
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,200
into his transmitter. "Can the signals 
get through those fields, Commander?"

1156
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,000
"No, Mac. They've been stopped,  

1157
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,640
Sparks tells me. We're here—and let's 
hope we stay. What's happening?"

1158
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,840
"They've got a revolving magnetic field 
out there that would spin a minor planet.  

1159
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:41,120
The whole blasted fort is acting like 
the squirrel cage in an induction motor!  

1160
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,760
They've made us the armature in a five 
hundred million horsepower electric motor."

1161
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,160
"They can't tear this place loose, can they?"

1162
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:57,040
"I don't know—it was never—" The Chief stopped. 
Outside a terrific roar and crash had built up.  

1163
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,440
White darts of flame leapt a 
thousand feet into the air,  

1164
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,560
hurling terrific masses of 
shattered rock and soil.

1165
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:11,760
"I was going to say," the Chief went on, "this 
place wasn't designed for that sort of a strain.  

1166
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,320
Our own magnetic field is supporting us now,  

1167
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:19,120
preventing their magnetic field from getting 
its teeth on metal. When the strain comes—well,  

1168
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:22,320
they're cutting loose our 
foundation with atomic bombs!"

1169
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:29,520
Five UV beams were combined on one interstellar 
ship. Instantly the great machine retreated,  

1170
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,720
and another dropped in to take its place while 
the magnetic field spun on, uninterruptedly.

1171
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,280
"Can they keep that up long?"

1172
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,920
"God knows—but they have a 
hundred and more ships to send in  

1173
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,920
when the power of one gives out, remember."

1174
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,840
"What's our reserve now?"

1175
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:51,840
The Chief paused a moment to look at the 
meters. "Half what it was ten minutes ago!"

1176
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:59,520
Commander Wallace sent some other orders. Every 
torpedo tube of the station suddenly belched forth  

1177
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:05,280
deadly, fifteen-foot torpedoes, most of 
them mud-torpedoes, torpedoes loaded with  

1178
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:10,320
high explosive in the nose, a delayed fuse, 
and a load of soft clinging mud in the rear.  

1179
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:15,920
The mud would flow down over the nose and 
offer a resistance foot-hold for the explosive  

1180
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:21,680
which empty space would not. Four hundred and 
three torpedoes, equipped with anti-magnetic  

1181
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:28,320
apparatus darted out. One hundred and 
four passed the struggling fields. One  

1182
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:33,040
found lodgement on a Miran ship, and crushed 
in a metal wall, to be stopped by a bulkhead.

1183
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,680
The Chief engineer watched his power declining. 
All ten UV beams were united in one now, driving  

1184
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:48,080
a terrible sword of energy that made the attacked 
ship skip for safety instantly, yet the beams were  

1185
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:53,680
all but useless. For the Miran reserves filled 
the gap, and the magnetic tornado continued.

1186
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:01,840
For seventeen long minutes the station resisted 
the attack. Then the last of the strained mercury  

1187
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:08,560
flowed into the receivers, and the vast power 
of the atostors was exhausted. Slowly the  

1188
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:14,480
magnetic fields declined. The great walls of the 
station felt the clutching lines of force—they  

1189
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:21,840
began to heat and to strain. A low, harsh grinding 
became audible over the roar of the atomic bombs.  

1190
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:28,160
The whole structure trembled, and jumped 
slightly. The roar of bombs ceased suddenly,  

1191
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:35,920
as the station jerked again, more violently. Then 
it turned a bit, rolled clumsily. Abruptly it  

1192
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:42,000
began to spin violently, more and more rapidly. 
It started rolling clumsily across the plateau—

1193
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:49,600
A rain of atomic bombs struck the unprotected 
metal, and the eighth breached the walls. The  

1194
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:54,480
twentieth was the last. There was 
no longer an IP station on Europa.

1195
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:01,360
"The difference," said Buck Kendall slowly, when 
the reports came in from scout-ships in space  

1196
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:06,640
that had witnessed the last struggle, "between 
an atomic generator and an atomic power-store,  

1197
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:11,440
or accumulator, is clearly shown. We 
haven't an adequate source of power."

1198
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,960
McLaurin sighed slowly, and rose 
to his feet. "What can we do?"

1199
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:23,200
"Thank our lucky stars that Faragaut here, and 
I, bought up all the mercury in the system,  

1200
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:27,920
and had it brought to Earth. We at least 
have a supply of materials for the atostors."

1201
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:29,920
"They don't seem to do much good."

1202
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,760
"They're the best we've got. All the photocells on  

1203
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:38,560
Earth and Venus and Mercury are at present 
busy storing the sun's power in atostors.  

1204
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:43,280
I have two thousand tons of charged mercury 
in our tanks here in the 'Lunar Bank.'"

1205
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,040
"Much good that will do—they can just 
pull and pull and pull till it's all gone.  

1206
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,520
A starfish isn't strong, but he 
can open the strongest oyster  

1207
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:58,160
just because he can pull from now 
on. You may have a lot of power—but."

1208
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:06,480
"But—we also have those new fifteen-foot UV 
beams. And one fifteen-foot UV beam is worth,  

1209
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:11,840
theoretically, nine five-foot beams, and 
practically, a dozen. We have a dozen of  

1210
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,600
them. Remember, this place was designed not 
only to protect itself, but Earth, too."

1211
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,240
"They can still pull, can't they?"

1212
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,520
"They'll stop pulling when they get 
their fingers burned. In the meantime,  

1213
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,840
why not use some of those IP ships to bring 
in a few more cargoes of charged mercury?"

1214
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:32,560
"They aren't good for much else,  

1215
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,760
are they? I wonder if those fellows 
have anything more we don't know?"

1216
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:44,000
"Oh, probably. I'm going to work on that crumbler 
thing. That's the first consideration now."

1217
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,240
"Why?"

1218
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:49,760
"So we can move a ship. As it is, even 
those two we built aren't any good."

1219
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,160
"Would they be anyway?"

1220
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:57,040
"Well—I think I might disturb 
those gentlemen slightly.  

1221
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:03,840
Remember, they each have a nose-beam eighteen 
feet across. Exceedingly unpleasant customers."

1222
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:13,760
"Score: Strangers; magnetic field, atomic bombs, 
atomic power, crumbler ray. Home team; UV beams."

1223
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:18,800
Kendall grinned. "I'd heard you were a 
pessimistic cuss when battle started—"

1224
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:22,080
"Pessimistic, hell, I'm 
merely counting things up."

1225
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:26,720
"McClellan had all the odds on 
Lee back in the Civil War of the  

1226
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:29,280
States—but Lee sent him home faster than he came."

1227
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,920
"But Lee lost in the end."

1228
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:37,760
"Why bring that up? I've got work to do." 
Still smiling, Kendall went to the laboratory  

1229
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:43,440
he had built up in the "Lunar Bank." Devin was 
already there, calculating. He looked unhappy.

1230
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:49,760
"We can't do anything, as far as I can see. 
They're using an electric field all right,  

1231
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:54,000
and projecting it. I can't 
see how we can do that."

1232
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,400
"Neither can I," agreed Kendall, "so we can't use 
that weapon. I really didn't want to anyway. Like  

1233
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:05,360
the neutron gun which I told Commander McLaurin 
would be useless as a weapon, they'd be prepared  

1234
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:11,200
for it, you can be sure. All I want to do is 
fight it, and make their projection useless."

1235
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:16,880
"Well, we have to know how they project it 
before we can break up the projection, don't we?"

1236
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:22,160
"Not at all. They're using an 
electric field of very high frequency,  

1237
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:29,440
but variable frequency. As far as I can see, all 
we need is a similar variable electric field of a  

1238
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:33,760
slightly different frequency to heterodyne 
theirs into something quite harmless."

1239
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:40,240
"Oh," said Devin. "We could, couldn't 
we? But how are you going to do that?"

1240
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:41,680
"We'll have to learn, that's all."

1241
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:50,400
Buck Kendall started trying to learn. In the 
meantime, the Mirans were taking over Jupiter.  

1242
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:56,800
There were three IP stations on the planet itself, 
but they were vastly hindered by the thick,  

1243
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:02,800
almost ultra-violet-proof atmosphere of Jupiter. 
Their rays were weak. And the magnetic fields of  

1244
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:08,400
the Mirans were unaffected. Only their atomic 
bombs were hindered by the heavier gravity that  

1245
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:11,840
pulled the rocks back in place faster 
than the bombs could throw them out.  

1246
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,600
Still—a few hours of work, and the IP 
stations on Jupiter had rolled wildly  

1247
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:22,000
across the flat plains of the planet like 
dented cans, to end in utter destruction.

1248
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,720
The Mirans had paid no attention to the 
fleeing passenger and freighter ships  

1249
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:32,160
that left the planet, loaded to the utmost 
with human cargo, and absolutely no freight.  

1250
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:36,560
The IP fleet had to go to their rescue with 
oxygen tanks to take care of the extra humans,  

1251
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:41,840
but nearly three-quarters of the population 
of Jupiter, a newly established population,  

1252
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:47,200
and hence a readily mobile one, was saved. 
The others, the Mirans did not bother with  

1253
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,880
particularly except when they happened to 
be near where the Mirans wanted to work.  

1254
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,040
Then they were instantly destroyed 
by atomic bombing, or gamma rays.

1255
02:02:56,320 --> 02:03:00,480
The Mirans settled almost at once, and 
began their work of finding on Jupiter  

1256
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:05,520
the badly needed atomic fuels. 
Machines were set up, and work begun,  

1257
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:12,160
Mirans laboring under the gravity of the heavy 
planet. Then, fifty ships swam up again, reloaded  

1258
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:16,960
with fuel, and with crews consisting solely 
of uninjured warriors, and started for Mars.

1259
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:24,240
Mars was half way between her near conjunction and 
her maximum elongation with respect to Jupiter at  

1260
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:30,480
that time. The Mirans knew their business though, 
for they started in on the IP station on Phobos.  

1261
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:36,080
They were practiced by this time, and this 
IP station had only seven five-foot beams.  

1262
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:42,560
In half an hour that station fell, and its sister 
station on Deimos followed. Three wounded ships  

1263
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:48,240
returned to Jupiter, and ten new ships came 
out. The attack on Mars itself was started.

1264
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:56,160
Mars was a different proposition. There were 
thirty-two IP stations here, one of them nearly  

1265
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:02,720
as powerful as the Lunar Bank station. It was 
equipped with four of the huge fifteen-foot beams.  

1266
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,960
And it had fifteen tons of 
mercury, more than seven-eighths  

1267
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:13,520
charged. The Mars Center Station was located 
a short ten miles from the Mars Center City,  

1268
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,160
and under the immediate orders of the IP 
heads, Mars Center City had been vacated.

1269
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:25,360
For two days the Mirans hung off Mars, 
solidifying their positions on Phobos and Deimos.  

1270
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:32,880
Then, with sixty-two ships, they attacked. They 
had made some very astute observations, and they  

1271
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:38,720
started on the smaller stations just beyond the 
range of the Mars Center Station. Naturally,  

1272
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:44,880
near so powerful a center, these stations had 
never been strong. They fell rapidly. But they  

1273
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:50,720
had been counted on by Mars Center as auxiliary 
supports. McLaurin had sent very definite  

1274
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:55,920
orders to Mars Center forbidding any action on 
their part, save gathering of power-supplies.

1275
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:02,800
At last the direct attack on Mars Center was 
launched. For the first time, the Mirans saw  

1276
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:09,840
one of the fifteen-foot beams. Mars' atmosphere is 
thin, and there is little ozone. The ultra-violet  

1277
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:15,600
beams were nearly as effective as in empty space. 
When the Mirans dropped their ships, a full  

1278
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:22,240
thirty of them, into the circle formation, Mars 
Center answered at once. All four beams started.

1279
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:30,160
Those fifteen-foot beams, connected directly 
to huge atostor release apparatus, delivered a  

1280
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:36,320
maximum power of two and three-quarter billion 
horsepower, each. The first Miran ship struck,  

1281
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:42,080
sparkled magnificently, and a terrific cascade 
of white-hot metal rolled down from its nose.  

1282
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:45,840
The great ship nosed down 
and to the left abruptly,  

1283
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:51,120
accelerated swiftly—and crashed with tremendous 
energy on the plain outside of Mars Center City.  

1284
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:57,680
White, unwavering flames licked up suddenly, 
and made a column five hundred feet high against  

1285
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:03,360
the dark sky. Then the wreck exploded with a 
violence that left a crater half a mile across.

1286
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,280
Three other ships had been struck, and were 
rapidly retreating. Another try was made  

1287
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:15,280
for the ring formation, and four more ships were 
wounded, and replaced. The ring did not retreat,  

1288
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:21,920
but the great magnetic field started. Atomic and 
gamma ray bombs started now, flashing sometimes  

1289
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:27,520
dangerously close to the station as its magnetic 
field battled the rotating field of the ships.  

1290
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,640
The four greater beams, and many smaller 
ones were in swift and angry action.  

1291
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:38,880
Not more than a ten-second exposure could be 
endured by any one ship, before it must retreat.

1292
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:48,000
For five minutes the Mirans hung doggedly at their 
task. Then, wisely, they retreated. Of the fleet,  

1293
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,560
not more than seven ships remained untouched. 
Mars Center Station had held—at what cost  

1294
02:06:54,560 --> 02:07:00,480
only they knew. Five hundred tons of their mercury 
had been exhausted in that brief five minutes.  

1295
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:05,440
One hundred tons a minute had flowed 
into and out of the atostor apparatus.  

1296
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,880
Mars Center radioed for 
help, when the fleet lifted.

1297
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,600
There was one other station on Mars 
that stood a good chance of survival,  

1298
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:19,760
Deenmor Station, with three of the big beams 
installed, and apparatus for their fourth  

1299
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:25,680
was in the station, and being rapidly worked 
over. McLaurin did a wise and courageous thing,  

1300
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:33,040
at which every man on Mars cursed. He ordered 
that all IP stations save these two be deserted,  

1301
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:37,200
and all mercury fuel reserves be 
moved to Deenmor and Mars Center.

1302
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,760
The Mirans could not land on the North Western 
section of Mars, nor in the South Central region.  

1303
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:50,080
Therefore Mars was not exactly habitable to 
Miran ships, because the great beams had been  

1304
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,840
so perfectly figured that they were effective 
at a range of nearly twelve hundred miles.

1305
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:00,240
Deenmor station was attacked—but it was 
a half-hearted attack, for Mirans were  

1306
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:03,600
becoming distinctly skittish 
about fifteen-foot UV beams.  

1307
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:11,600
Two badly blistered ships—and the Mirans retreated 
to Jupiter. But Mira held Phobos and Deimos.  

1308
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:17,520
In two weeks, they had set up cannon there, and 
proved themselves accurate long-range gunners.  

1309
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:22,240
Against the feeble attraction of Deimos, 
and with Mars' gravity to help them,  

1310
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:26,720
they began bombarding the two stations, and 
anything that attempted to approach them,  

1311
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:33,600
with gamma and atomic explosive bombs. Meanwhile 
they amused themselves occasionally by planting a  

1312
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:40,640
gamma-ray bomb in each of Mars' major cities. They 
made Mars uninhabitable for Solarians as well as  

1313
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:46,960
for Mirans, at least until the deadly slow-action 
atomic explosives wore off, or were removed.

1314
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:53,600
Then the Mirans, after a lapse of three weeks 
while they dug in their toes on Jupiter,  

1315
02:08:53,600 --> 02:09:00,320
prepared to leap. Earth was the next goal. Miran 
scout-ships had been sent out before this—and  

1316
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:05,520
severely handled by the concentrated fleets of 
the IP that hung grimly off Earth and Luna now.  

1317
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:12,480
But the scouts had learned one thing. Mirans 
could never hope to attain a firm grasp on Earth  

1318
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:18,480
while terribly armed Luna hung like a Sword of 
Damocles over their heads. Further, attack on  

1319
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:24,400
Earth directly would be next to impossible, for, 
thanks to Faragaut's Interplanetary Company,  

1320
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:29,840
nearly all the mercury metal in the system was 
safely lodged on Earth, and saturated with power.  

1321
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:34,160
Every major city had been 
equipped with great UV apparatus.  

1322
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:40,800
And neutron guns in plenty waited on small 
ships just outside the atmosphere to explode  

1323
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,840
harmlessly any atomic or gamma bombs 
Miran ships might attempt to deposit.

1324
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:53,440
An attack on Luna was the first step. But that 
terrible, gigantic fort on Luna worried them.  

1325
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:59,520
Yet while that fort existed, Earth ships 
were free to come and go, for Mirans  

1326
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:04,400
could not afford to stand near. At 
a distance of twenty thousand miles,  

1327
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,840
small Miran ships had felt the 
touch of those great UV beams.

1328
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:12,800
Finally, a brief test-attack was made, 
with an entire fleet of one hundred ships.  

1329
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:17,040
They drew almost into position, faster than light,  

1330
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:22,640
faster than the signaling warnings could send 
their messages. In position, all those great  

1331
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:28,160
ships strained and heaved at the mighty magnetic 
vortex that twisted at the field of the fort.  

1332
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:35,760
Instantly, twelve of the fifteen-foot UV 
beams replied. And—two great UV beams of  

1333
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:41,840
a size the Mirans had never seen before, beams 
from the two ships, "S Doradus" and "Cepheid."

1334
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:49,200
The test-attack dissolved as suddenly as it 
had come. The Mirans returned to Jupiter,  

1335
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:52,320
and to the outer planets where they 
had further established themselves.  

1336
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:59,200
Most of the Solar system was theirs. But the 
Solarians still held the choicest planets—and  

1337
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,400
kept the Mirans from using 
the mild-temperatured Mars.

1338
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,600
"They can't take this, at least," sighed 
McLaurin as they retreated from Luna.

1339
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:31,200
"I didn't think they could—right away. 
I'm wondering though if they haven't  

1340
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:37,000
something we haven't seen yet. Besides 
which—give them time, give them time."

1341
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:41,600
"Well, give us time, too," snapped 
McLaurin. "How are you coming?"

1342
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,600
Buck smiled. "I'm sure I don't know.  

1343
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:50,720
I have a machine but I haven't the slightest 
idea of whether or not it's any good."

1344
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,240
"Why not?"

1345
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:57,680
"I can destroy—I hope—but 
I can't build up their ray.  

1346
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:01,920
I can't test the machine because I 
haven't their ray to test it against."

1347
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,480
"What can we do to test it?"

1348
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:08,320
"The only thing I can see is 
to call for volunteers—and  

1349
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:13,600
send out a six-man cruiser. If the ship's too 
small, they may not destroy it with the big  

1350
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:19,840
crumbler rays. If it's too large—and the 
machine didn't work—we'd lose too much."

1351
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:26,240
Twelve hours later, the IP men at the Lunar Bank 
fort were lined up. McLaurin stepped up on the  

1352
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:33,520
platform, and addressed the men briefly, told them 
what was needed. Six volunteers were selected by  

1353
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:39,520
a process of elimination, those who were married, 
had dependents, officers, and others were refused.  

1354
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:47,120
Finally, six men of the IP were chosen, neither 
rookies nor veterans, six average men. And one  

1355
02:12:47,120 --> 02:12:52,160
average six-man cruiser, one hundred and 
eleven feet long, twenty-two in diameter.  

1356
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:58,560
It was the T-208, a sister ship of the 
T-247, the first ship to be destroyed.

1357
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:05,600
The T-208 started out from Luna, and with 
full acceleration, sped out toward Phobos.  

1358
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:11,120
Slowly she circled the satellite, while 
distant scouts kept her under view.  

1359
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:16,640
Lazily, the Miran patrol on 
Phobos watched the T-208,  

1360
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:23,520
indifferent to her. The T-208 dove suddenly, 
after five fruitless circles of the tiny world,  

1361
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:30,000
and with her four-foot UV beam flaming, stabbed 
angrily at a flight of Miran scouts berthed in  

1362
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,440
the very shadow of a great battle cruiser, one of 
the interstellar ships stationed here on Phobos.

1363
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,000
Four of the little ships slumped in incandescence.  

1364
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,720
Angrily the terrific sword of energy 
slashed at the frail little scouts.

1365
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,880
Angrily the Miran interstellar ship shot 
herself abruptly into action against this  

1366
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:57,600
insolent cruiser. The cruiser launched a flight 
of the mercury-torpedoes. Flashing, burning,  

1367
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:03,040
ultra-violet energy flooded the great ship, 
harmlessly, for the men were, as usual, protected.  

1368
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:09,120
The Miran answered with the neutron beam, 
atomic and gamma bombs—and the crumbler ray.

1369
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:16,000
Gently, softly a halo of shimmering-violet 
luminescence built up about the T-208.  

1370
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,560
The UV beam continued to flare, 
wavering slightly in its aim—then  

1371
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:27,040
fell way off to one side. The T-208 staggered 
suddenly, wandered from her course—whole,  

1372
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:31,360
but uncontrolled. For the men 
within the ship were dead.

1373
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:38,640
Majestically the Miran swung along beside the 
dead ship, a great magnetic tow-cable shot out  

1374
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:44,720
toward it, to shy off at first, then slowly to be 
adjusted, and take hold in the magnetic shield of  

1375
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:51,440
the T-208. The pilots of the watching scout-ships 
turned away. They knew what would happen.

1376
02:14:53,600 --> 02:15:01,280
It did. Five—ten—twenty seconds passed. 
Then the "dead-man" took over the ship—and  

1377
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:07,280
the stored power in the atostor tanks 
blasted in a terrible flame that shattered  

1378
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:13,200
the metal hull to molecular fragments. 
The interstellar cruiser shuddered,  

1379
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:18,320
and rolled half over at the blasting pressure. 
Leaking seams appeared in her plates.

1380
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:26,640
The scouts raced back to Luna as the Miran settled 
heavily, and a trifle clumsily to Phobos. Miran  

1381
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:31,920
radio-beams were forcing their way out toward 
the Miran station on Europa, to be relayed to the  

1382
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:37,600
headquarters on Jupiter, just as Solarian radio 
beams were thrusting through space toward Luna.  

1383
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:45,280
Said the Miran messages: "Their ships no 
longer crumble." Said the Solarian messages:  

1384
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,320
"The ships no longer crumble—but the men die."

1385
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:55,200
His deep eyes burning tensely, Buck 
Kendall heard the messages coming in,  

1386
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,840
and rose slowly from his seat to pace the floor.  

1387
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:04,720
"I think I know why," he said at last. "I should 
have thought. For that too can be prevented."

1388
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:10,400
"Why—what in the name of the Planets?" 
asked McLaurin. "It didn't kill the men  

1389
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:14,320
in the forts—why does it kill the men in 
the ships, when the ships are protected?"

1390
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,880
"The protection kills them."

1391
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:22,240
"But—but they had the protective oscillations 
on all the way out!" protested the Commander.

1392
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:30,000
"Think how it works though. Think, man. The 
enemy's field is an electric-field oscillation.  

1393
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:35,520
We combat it by setting up a similar oscillating 
field in the metal of the hull ourselves.  

1394
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:41,280
Because the metal conducts the strains, 
they meet, and oppose. It is not a shield—a  

1395
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,840
shield is impossible, as I have said, 
because of energy concentration factors.  

1396
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:50,720
If their beam carried a hundred thousand 
horsepower in a ten-foot square beam,  

1397
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:56,080
in every ten square feet of our shield, we'd 
have to have one hundred thousand horsepower.  

1398
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:01,280
In other words, hundreds of times as much 
energy would be needed in the shield,  

1399
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:09,200
as they used in their beam. We can't afford that. 
We had to let the beams oppose our oscillations  

1400
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:13,840
in the metal, where, because the metal 
conducts, they meet on an equal basis.  

1401
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:19,839
But—when two oscillations of slightly 
different frequency meet, what is the result?"

1402
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:24,960
"In this case, a heterodyne frequency 
of a lower, and harmless frequency."

1403
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:33,120
"So I thought. I was partly right. It does 
not harm the metal. But it kills the men.  

1404
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:40,160
It is super-sonic. The terrible, shrill 
sounds destroy the cells of the men's bodies.  

1405
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:45,520
Then, when their dead hands release the controls, 
the automatic switches blow up the ship."

1406
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:52,960
"God! We stop one menace—and it is like the 
Hydra. For every head we lop off, two spring up."

1407
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:59,760
"Ah—but they are lesser heads. Look, what is the 
fundamental difference between sound and light?"

1408
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:06,799
"One is a vibration of matter and 
the—ah—eliminate the material contact!"

1409
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:14,560
"Exactly! All we need to do is to let the ships 
operate airless, the men in space suits. Then  

1410
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:20,320
the air cannot carry the sounds to them. And by 
putting special damping materials in their suits,  

1411
02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:23,840
we can stop the vibrations that would 
reach them through their feet and hands.  

1412
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:29,440
Another six-man ship must go 
out—but this ship will come back!"

1413
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:35,439
And with the order for another experimental 
ship, went the orders for commercial  

1414
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:40,960
supplies of this new apparatus. Every 
IP ship must be equipped to resist it.

1415
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:49,280
Buck Kendall sailed on the six-man scout that went 
out this time. Again they swooped once at Phobos,  

1416
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:55,599
again Miran scout-ships crumbled under the attack 
of the vicious UV beams. The Mirans were not  

1417
02:18:55,600 --> 02:19:02,000
waiting contemptuously this time. In an instant 
the great interstellar ship rose from its berth,  

1418
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,840
its weapons working angrily. The 
crumbler ray snapped out at the T-253.

1419
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:15,040
Kendall stared into the periscope visor intently. 
Clumsily his padded hands worked at the specially  

1420
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:21,120
adapted controls. The soft hiss of the oxygen 
release into his suit disturbed him slightly.  

1421
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:25,920
The radio-phones in his helmet carried 
all the conversations in the ship to him  

1422
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:30,800
with equal clarity. He watched as 
the great ship angled angrily up—

1423
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:38,000
His vision was momentarily obscured by a violet 
glow that built up and reached out gently from  

1424
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:46,560
every point of metal in the ship. The instant 
Kendall saw that, the T-253 was fleeing under  

1425
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:53,920
his hands. The test had been made. Now all he 
desired was safety again. The ion-rockets flared  

1426
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:59,600
recklessly as, crushed under an acceleration 
of four Earth-gravities, he sank heavily into  

1427
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:06,000
his seat. Grimly the Miran ship was pursuing 
them, easily keeping up with the fleeing midget.  

1428
02:20:06,880 --> 02:20:11,200
The crumbler became more intense, 
the violet glow more vivid.

1429
02:20:12,319 --> 02:20:16,559
The UV beam was reaching out 
directly behind now. The—

1430
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:21,759
With a cry of agony, Kendall ripped the 
radio-phone connection out of his suit.  

1431
02:20:22,399 --> 02:20:27,759
A soft hiss of leaking air warned him of 
too great violence only minutes later.  

1432
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:32,640
For his ears had been deafened by the sudden 
shriek of a tremendous signal from outside!

1433
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:40,559
Instantly Kendall knew what that meant. And 
he could not communicate with his men! There  

1434
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:45,600
was no metal in these special suits, even the 
oxygen tanks were made of synthetic plastics  

1435
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:52,241
of tremendous strength. No scrap of vibrating 
metal was permissible. The padded gloves and  

1436
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:56,479
boots protected him—but there was a new and 
different type of crackle and haze from the  

1437
02:20:56,479 --> 02:21:02,879
metal points now. It was almost invisible in the 
practically airless ship, but Kendall saw it.

1438
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:07,680
Presently he felt it, as he 
desperately increased his acceleration.  

1439
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:14,000
Slow creeping heat was attacking him. 
The heat was increasing rapidly now.  

1440
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:18,880
Desperately he was working at the 
crumbler-protection controls—but  

1441
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:25,840
immediately set them back as they were. He 
had to have the crumbler protection as well—!

1442
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:32,640
Grimly the great Miran ship hung right beside 
them. Angrily the two four-foot UV beams flashed  

1443
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:39,920
back—seeking some weak spot. There were none. 
At her absolute maximum of acceleration the  

1444
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:46,480
little ship plunged on. Gamma and atomic bombs 
were washing her in flame. The heavy blocks of  

1445
02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:51,839
paraffin between her walls were long since melted, 
retained only by the presence of the metal walls.  

1446
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:57,200
Smoke was beginning to filter out 
now, and Kendall recognized a new,  

1447
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:03,920
and deadlier menace! Heat—quantities of 
heat were being poured into the little ship,  

1448
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:10,640
and the neutron guns were doing their best to add 
to it. The paraffin was confined in there—and like  

1449
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:16,880
any substance, it could be volatilized, and as 
a vapor, develop pressure—explosive pressure!

1450
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:22,479
The Miran seemed satisfied 
in his tactics so far—and  

1451
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:26,319
changed them. Forty-seven 
million miles from Earth,  

1452
02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:32,240
the Miran simply accelerated a bit more, and 
crowded the Solarian ship a bit. White-faced,  

1453
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:38,160
Buck Kendall was forced to turn a bit aside. The 
Miran turned also. Kendall turned a bit more—

1454
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:43,680
Flashing across his range of 
vision at an incredible speed,  

1455
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:51,920
a tiny thing, no more than twenty feet long and 
five in diameter, a scout-ship appeared. Its  

1456
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:59,120
tiny nose ultra-violet beam was blasting a solid 
cylinder of violet incandescence a foot across  

1457
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:04,240
in the hull of the Miran—and, to the Miran, 
angling swiftly across his range of vision.  

1458
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:11,919
Its magnetic field clashed for a thousandth 
of a second with the T-253, instantly meeting,  

1459
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:18,480
and absorbing the fringing edges. Then—it swept 
through the Miran's magnetic shield as easily.  

1460
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:23,679
The delicate instruments of the scout 
instantaneously adjusted its own magnetic  

1461
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:28,800
field as much as possible. There was 
resistance, enormous resistance—the  

1462
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:36,000
ship crumpled in on itself, the tail vanished 
in dust as a sweeping crumbler beam caught it  

1463
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,800
at last—and the remaining portion of the 
ship plowed into the nose of the Miran.

1464
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:47,760
The Miran's force-control-room was 
wrecked. For perhaps a minute and a half,  

1465
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:53,520
the ship was without control, then the control 
was re-established—and in vain the telescopes and  

1466
02:23:53,520 --> 02:24:00,480
instruments searched for the T-253. Lightless, 
her rockets out now, her fields damped down to  

1467
02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:07,280
extinction, the T-253 was lost in the pulsing, 
gyrating fields of half a dozen scout-ships.

1468
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:13,920
Kendall looked grimly at the crushed spot on the 
nose of the Miran. His ship was drifting slowly  

1469
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:19,600
away from the greater ship. Presently, however, 
the Miran put on speed in the direction of Earth,  

1470
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:27,281
and the T-253 fell far behind. The Miran was 
not seriously injured. But that scout pilot,  

1471
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:33,280
in sacrificing life, had thrown dust in their 
eyes for just those few moments Kendall had  

1472
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:39,120
needed to lose a lightless ship in lightless 
space—lightless—for the Mirans at any rate.  

1473
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:46,000
The IP ships had been covered with a black paint, 
and in no time at all, Kendall had gotten his ship  

1474
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,359
into a position where the energy radiations of 
the sun made him undetectable from the Miran's  

1475
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:57,120
position, since the radiation of his own ship, 
even in the heat range, was mingled with the  

1476
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:04,080
direct radiation of the sun. The sun was in the 
Miran's "eyes," both actual and instrumental.

1477
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:09,519
An hour later the Miran returned, passed 
the still-lightless ship at a distance  

1478
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:14,161
of five million miles, and settled to 
Phobos for the slight repairs needed.

1479
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:23,840
Twelve hours later, the T-253 settled to Luna, 
for the many rearrangements she would need.

1480
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:28,400
"I rather knew it was coming," Kendall 
admitted sadly, "but danged if I didn't  

1481
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:33,280
forget all about it. And—cost the life 
of one of the finest men in the system.  

1482
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:39,919
Jehnson's family get a permanent pension just 
twice his salary, McLaurin. In the meantime—"

1483
02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:43,839
"What was it? Pure heat, but how?"

1484
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:52,161
"Pure radio. Nothing but short-wave radio 
directed at us. They probably had the apparatus,  

1485
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:57,439
knew how to make it, but that's not a good type 
of heat ray, because a radio tube is generally  

1486
02:25:57,439 --> 02:26:02,399
less than eighty percent efficient, which is a 
whale of a loss when you're working in a battle,  

1487
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:08,000
and a whale of an inconvenience. We were 
heated only four times as much as the Miran.  

1488
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,360
He had to pump that heat into a heat-reservoir—a 
water tank probably—to protect himself.  

1489
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:17,520
Highly inefficient and 
ineffective against a large ship.  

1490
02:26:18,319 --> 02:26:23,120
Also, he had to hold his beam on us nearly ten 
minutes before it would have become unbearable.  

1491
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:30,000
He was again, trying to kill the men, and not the 
ship. The men are the weakest point, obviously."

1492
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,640
"Can you overcome that?"

1493
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:39,600
"Obviously, no. The thing works on pure energy. 
I'd have to match his energy to neutralize it.  

1494
02:26:40,479 --> 02:26:46,240
You knew it's an old proposition, that if you 
could take a beam of pure, monochromatic light and  

1495
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:52,399
divide it exactly in half, and then recombine it 
in perfect interference, you'd have annihilation  

1496
02:26:52,399 --> 02:26:59,759
of energy. Cancellation to extinction. The 
trouble is, you never do get that. You can't  

1497
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:05,760
get monochromatic light, because light can't 
be monochromatic. That's due to the Heisenberg  

1498
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:12,720
Uncertainty—my pet bug-bear. The atom that 
radiates the light, must be moving. If it isn't,  

1499
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:18,400
the emission of the light itself gives it a kick 
that moves it. Now, no matter what the quantum  

1500
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:25,439
might have been, it loses energy in kicking the 
atom. That changes the situation instantly, and  

1501
02:27:25,439 --> 02:27:31,200
incidentally the 'color' of the light. Then, since 
all the radiating atoms won't be moving alike,  

1502
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:38,559
etc., the mass of light can't be monochromatic. 
Therefore perfect interference is impossible.

1503
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:44,880
"The way that relates to the problem in hand, 
is that we can't possibly destroy his energy.  

1504
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:52,480
We can, as we do in the crumbler stunt, change it. 
He can't, I suspect, put too much power behind his  

1505
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:58,319
crumbler, or he'd have crumbling going on 
at home. We get a slight heating from it,  

1506
02:27:58,319 --> 02:28:05,200
anyway. Into the bargain, his radio was after 
us, and his neutrons naturally carried energy.  

1507
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:12,080
Now, no matter what we do, we've got that 
to handle. When we fight his crumbler,  

1508
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:18,880
we actually add heat-energy to it, ourselves, and 
make the heating effect just twice as bad. If we  

1509
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:24,960
try to heterodyne his radio—presto—it has twice 
the heat energy anyway, though we might reduce  

1510
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:31,280
it to a frequency that penetrated the ship instead 
of all staying in it. But by the proposition, we  

1511
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:37,920
have to use as much energy, and in fact, remember 
the 80% rule. We've got to take it and like it."

1512
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:42,559
"But," objected McLaurin, "we don't like it."

1513
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,120
"Then build ships as big as his, and he'll quit 
trying to roast you. Particularly if the inner  

1514
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:55,120
walls are synthetic plastics. Did you know I 
used them in the 'S Doradus' and 'Cepheid'?"

1515
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:57,679
"Yes. Were you thinking of that?"

1516
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:04,720
"No—just luck—and the fact that they're light, 
strong as steel almost, and can be manufactured  

1517
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:10,640
in forms much more quickly. Only the outer 
hull is tungsten-beryllium. The advantage in  

1518
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:17,120
this will be that nearly all the energy will be 
absorbed outside, and we'll radiate pretty fast,  

1519
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,840
particularly as that tungsten-beryllium has a 
high radiation-factor in the long heat range."

1520
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,680
"What does that mean?"

1521
02:29:24,960 --> 02:29:32,080
"Well, ordinary polished silver is a mighty poor 
radiator. Homely example: Try waiting for your  

1522
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:37,760
coffee to cool if it's in a polished silver 
pot. Then try it in a tungsten-beryllium pot.  

1523
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:44,960
No matter how you polish that tungsten-beryllium, 
the stuff WILL radiate heat. That's why an IP  

1524
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:51,359
ship is always so blamed cold. You know the 
passenger ships use polished aluminum outer walls.  

1525
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:57,280
The big help is, that the tungsten-beryllium will 
throw off the energy pretty fast, and in a big  

1526
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:03,920
ship, with a whale of a lot of matter to heat, 
the Strangers will simply give up the idea."

1527
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:07,280
"Yes, but only two ships in the 
system compare with them in size."

1528
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:10,879
"Sorry—but I didn't build the IP fleet,  

1529
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:14,480
and there are lots of tungsten and 
beryllium on Earth. Enough anyway."

1530
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:19,121
"Will they use that beam on the fort? 
And can't we use the thing on them?"

1531
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,560
"They won't and we won't—though we 
could. A bank of those new million  

1532
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:28,960
watt tubes—perhaps a hundred of them—and 
we'd have a pretty effective heater—but  

1533
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:32,880
an awful waste of power. 
I've got something better."

1534
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:34,160
"New?"

1535
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,399
"Somewhat. I've found out how to make the mirror 
field in a plate of metal, instead of a block.  

1536
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:42,640
Come on to the lab, and I'll show you."

1537
02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:48,080
"What's the advantage? Oh—weight 
saved, and silver metal saved."

1538
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:51,200
"A lot more than that, Mac. Watch."

1539
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:56,960
At the laboratory, the new apparatus looked 
immensely lighter and simpler than the old.  

1540
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:03,920
The atostor, the ionizer, and the twin 
ion-projectors were as before, great, rigid,  

1541
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:09,920
metal structures that would maintain the meeting 
point of the ions with inflexible exactitude under  

1542
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:16,560
any acceleration strains. But now, instead of the 
heavy silver block in which a mirror was figured,  

1543
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:22,399
the mirror consisted of a polished silver 
plate, parabolic to be sure, but little more  

1544
02:31:22,399 --> 02:31:27,839
than a half-inch in thickness. It was mounted 
in a framework of complex, stout metal braces.

1545
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:34,720
Kendall started the ion-flame at low intensity, 
so the UV beam was little more than a spotlight.

1546
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:41,359
"You missed the point, Mac. Now—watch 
that tungsten-beryllium plate.  

1547
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:45,200
I'll hold the power steady. 
It's an eighteen-inch beam—and  

1548
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:51,600
now the energy is just sufficient to heat 
that tungsten plate to bright red. But—"

1549
02:31:52,479 --> 02:31:57,359
Kendall turned over a small rheostat 
control—and abruptly the eighteen-inch  

1550
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:02,960
diameter spot on the tungsten-beryllium plate 
began contracting; it contracted till it  

1551
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:09,840
was a blazing, sparkling spot of molten 
incandescence less than an inch across!

1552
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:16,480
"That's the advantage of focus. At this distance 
of a few hundred feet with a small beam I can  

1553
02:32:16,479 --> 02:32:22,479
do that. With a twenty-foot beam, I can get a 
two-foot spot at a distance of nearly ten miles!  

1554
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:28,000
That means that the receiving end will have the 
pleasure of handling one hundred times the energy  

1555
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:34,160
concentration. That would punch a hole through 
most anything. All you have to do is focus it.  

1556
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:38,560
The trouble being, if it's out of 
focus the advantage is more than lost.  

1557
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:43,360
So if there's any question about getting 
the focus, we'll get along without it."

1558
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:48,640
"A real help, if you do. That 
would punch a hole before the  

1559
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,560
Stranger ship could turn away as they do now."

1560
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:57,201
Kendall nodded. "That's what I was after. 
It is mainly for the forts, though. We'll  

1561
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:02,960
have to signal the dope to the Mars Center and 
Deenmor stations. They can fix it up, themselves.  

1562
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:08,720
In the meantime—all we can do is hold on and hunt, 
and let's hope better than the Strangers do."

1563
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:31,439
Sadly the convalescent Gresth Gkae 
listened to the reports of his lieutenants.  

1564
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:38,319
More and more disgraced he felt as he realized how 
badly he had blundered in reporting the people of  

1565
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:44,399
this system unable to cope with the attackers' 
weapons. Gresth Gkae looked up at his old friend  

1566
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:53,280
and physician, Merth Skahl. He shook his head 
slowly. "I'm afraid, Merth Skahl. I am afraid.  

1567
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:59,280
We have, perhaps, made a mistake. The better 
and the stronger alone should rule. Aye,  

1568
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:06,000
but is the stronger always the better? I am afraid 
we have mistaken the Truth in assuming this.  

1569
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:11,440
If we have—then may Jarth, Lord 
of Truth and Wisdom punish us.  

1570
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:17,760
Mighty Jarth, if I have mistaken in following 
my judgments, it is not from disobedience,  

1571
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:23,680
it is lack of Thy knowledge. The strongest—they 
are not always the better, are they?"

1572
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:32,240
Merth Skahl bent sharply over his friend. "Quiet 
thyself, Gresth Gkae. You know, and I know,  

1573
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:37,920
you have done only your best, and surely 
Jarth himself can ask no better of any one.  

1574
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:44,080
You must rest, for only by rest can 
those terrible burns be healed. All  

1575
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:50,000
your stheen over half the body-area was burned 
off. You have been delirious for many days."

1576
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:57,920
"But Merth Skahl, think—have we disobeyed 
Jarth's will? It is, we know, his will that  

1577
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:05,040
only the best and the strongest shall rule—but 
are the best always the strongest? An imbecile  

1578
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:11,840
adult could destroy the life of a genius-grade 
child. The strongest wins, but not the best.  

1579
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:19,760
Such would not be the will of Jarth. If we be the 
stronger, and the best, then it is right and just  

1580
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:24,560
that these strange creatures should be destroyed 
that we may have a stable world of stable light  

1581
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:30,320
and heat. But look and see, with what terrible 
swiftness these strange creatures have learned!  

1582
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:37,359
May it not be they are the better race—that 
it is we who are the weaker and the poorer?  

1583
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:43,040
Can it be that Jarth has brought us together 
that these people might learn—and destroy us?  

1584
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:50,800
If they be the stronger, and the better—then 
may Jarth's will be done. But we must test our  

1585
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:56,560
strength to the utmost. I must rise, and go 
to my laboratory soon. They have set it up?"

1586
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:02,241
"Aye, they have, Gresth Gkae. But 
remember, the weak and the sick make  

1587
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:07,439
faults the strong and the well do not. 
Better that you rest yourself. There is  

1588
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,759
little you can do while your body seeks 
to recover from these terrible burns."

1589
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:16,400
"You are wrong, my friend, wrong. Don't you  

1590
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:22,559
see that my mind is clear—that it is the 
mind which must fight in these battles,  

1591
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:26,640
for surely the man is weak against 
such things as this infra-X-radiation?  

1592
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:32,799
Why, I am better able to fight now than are 
you, for I am a trained fighter of the mind,  

1593
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:39,600
while you are a trained healer of the body. These 
strange beings with their stiff arms and legs,  

1594
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:47,360
their tender skins, and—and their swift minds have 
fought us all too well. If we must test, let it be  

1595
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:53,439
a test. I have heard how they so quickly solved 
the riddle of the crumbling field. That took us  

1596
02:36:53,439 --> 02:37:00,639
longer, and we designed it. The Counsel of Worlds 
put me in command, let me up, Skahl, I must work."

1597
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:08,161
Concerned, the physician looked down 
at him. Finally he spoke again. "No,  

1598
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:13,840
I will not permit you to leave the hospital-ship. 
You must stay here, but if, as you have said,  

1599
02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:20,080
the mind is what must fight, then surely you can 
fight well from here, for your mind is here."

1600
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:27,760
"No, I cannot, and you well know it. I may 
shorten my life, but what matter. 'Death is  

1601
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:33,840
the end toward which the chemical reaction, Life, 
tends,'" quoted the scientist. "You know I have  

1602
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:39,440
left my children—my immortality is assured 
through them. I can afford to die in peace,  

1603
02:37:39,439 --> 02:37:47,359
if it assures their welfare. Time is precious, 
and while my mind might work from here, it must  

1604
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:54,479
have data on which to work. For that, I must 
go to the laboratories. Help me, Merth Skahl."

1605
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:03,440
Reluctantly the physician granted the request, but 
begged of Gresth Gkae a promise of at least six  

1606
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:08,799
hours rest in every fifteen, and a good sleep 
of at least twenty-seven hours every "night."  

1607
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:14,000
Gresth Gkae agreed, and from a 
wheelchair, conducted his work,  

1608
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,720
began a new line of experimentation he hoped 
would yield them the weapon they needed.  

1609
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:26,800
Under him, the staff of scientists worked, aiding 
and advising and suggesting. The apparatus was  

1610
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:33,600
built, tested, and found wanting. Time and again 
as the days passed, they watched Gresth Gkae,  

1611
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:40,161
gaining strength very, very slowly, taken away 
despondent at the end of his forty hours of work.

1612
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:44,319
A dozen expeditions were sent to Jupiter's poles  

1613
02:38:44,319 --> 02:38:49,200
to watch and measure and study the 
tremendous auroral displays there,  

1614
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:55,280
where Jupiter's vast magnetic field sucked in 
countless quintillions of the flying electrons  

1615
02:38:55,280 --> 02:39:01,759
from the sun, and brought them circling in, in a 
vast, magnificent display of auroral ionization.

1616
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:07,200
Expeditions went to the great Southern 
Plateau, the Plateau of Storms,  

1617
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:13,600
where the titanic air currents resulted in an 
everlasting display of terrific lightnings, great  

1618
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:19,440
burning balls of electric force floating dangerous 
and deadly across the frozen, ultra-cold plain.

1619
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:27,120
And the expeditions brought back data. 
Yet still Gresth Gkae could not sleep,  

1620
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:33,680
his thoughts intruding constantly. Hours Merth 
Skahl spent with him, calming him to sleep.

1621
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:39,280
"But what is this constant search? It 
is little enough I know of science,  

1622
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:44,319
but why do you send our men to these spots of 
wonderfully beautiful, but useless natural forces.  

1623
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:48,640
Can we somehow, do you think, turn them 
against the people of these worlds?"

1624
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:57,359
Softly the old Miran smiled. "Yes, you 
might say so. For look, it is the strange  

1625
02:39:57,359 --> 02:40:03,599
balls of electric force I want to know about. 
Sthor had few, but occasionally we saw them.  

1626
02:40:04,319 --> 02:40:09,759
Never were they properly investigated. I 
want to know their secret, for I am sure  

1627
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:15,280
they are balls of electric forces not vastly 
dissimilar from the nucleus of the atom.  

1628
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:21,279
Always we have known that no system of 
purely electrical forces could remain stable.  

1629
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:28,960
Yet these strange balls of energy do. 
How is it? I am sure it will be of vast  

1630
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:35,760
importance. But the direct secret I hope to learn 
is in this: What can be done with electric fields  

1631
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:41,920
can nearly always be duplicated, or paralleled 
in magnetic fields. If I can learn how to make  

1632
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:47,840
these electric balls of energy, can I not hope 
to make similar magnetic balls of energy?"

1633
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:53,920
"Yes, I see—that would seem true. But 
what benefit would you derive from that?  

1634
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:57,760
You have magnetic beams now, 
and yet they are useless  

1635
02:40:57,760 --> 02:41:02,160
because you can get nowhere near the 
forts. How then would these benefit you?"

1636
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:09,840
"We can do nothing to those forts, because of 
that magnetic shield. Could we once break it down,  

1637
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:16,400
then the fort is helpless, and one or two small 
atomic bombs destroy it. But—we cannot stay near,  

1638
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:22,000
for the terrible infra-X-rays of theirs 
burn holes in our ships, and—in our men.

1639
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:27,680
"But look you, I can drop many atomic bombs from 
a distance where their beams are ineffective.  

1640
02:41:28,399 --> 02:41:36,719
Suppose I do make a magnetic ball of energy, a 
magnetic bomb. Then—I can drop it from a distance!  

1641
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:41,201
We have learned that the power supply 
of these forts is very great—but  

1642
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:47,200
not endless, as is ours now, thanks to the vast 
supplies of power metal on this heavy planet.  

1643
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:55,120
Then all we need do is stay at a distance where 
they cannot reach us—and drop magnetic bombs. Ah,  

1644
02:41:55,120 --> 02:42:01,200
they will be stopped, and their energy 
absorbed. But we can keep it up, day after day,  

1645
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:07,439
and slowly drain out their power. Then—then 
our atomic bombs can destroy those forts,  

1646
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:11,839
and we can move on!" But suddenly the 
animation and strength left his voice.  

1647
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:21,120
He turned a sad, downcast face to his friend. 
"But Merth Skahl, we can't do it," he complained.

1648
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:26,080
"Ah—now I can see why you so want to continue this  

1649
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:32,399
wearing and worrying work. You need 
time, Gresth Gkae, only time for success.  

1650
02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:37,439
Tomorrow it may be that you will see the 
first hint that will lead you to success."

1651
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:42,960
"Ah—I only hope it, Merth Skahl, I only hope it."

1652
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:51,920
But it was the next day that they saw the first 
glimpse of the secret, and saw the path that might  

1653
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:57,760
lead to hope and success. In a week they were 
sending electric bombs across the laboratory.  

1654
02:42:58,399 --> 02:43:04,399
And in three days more, a magnetic bomb streaked 
dully across the laboratory to a magnetic shield  

1655
02:43:04,399 --> 02:43:09,519
they had set up, and buried itself in it, 
to explode in brilliant light and heat.

1656
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:14,400
From that day Gresth Gkae began to mend.  

1657
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:19,519
In the three weeks that were needed to build 
the apparatus into ships, he regained strength  

1658
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:25,121
so that when the first flight of five interstellar 
ships rose from Jupiter, he was on the flagship.

1659
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:31,680
To Phobos they went first, to the 
little inner satellite of Mars,  

1660
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:37,840
scarcely eight miles in diameter, a tiny bit 
of broken metal and rock, utterly airless,  

1661
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:46,400
but scarcely more than 3700 miles from the surface 
of Mars below. The Mars Center and Deenmor forts  

1662
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:51,920
were wasting no power raying a ship at that 
distance. They could, of course, have damaged it,  

1663
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:58,080
but not severely enough to make up for the loss of 
their strictly limited power. The photocells had  

1664
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:04,640
been working overtime, every minute of available 
light had been used, and still scarcely 2100 tons  

1665
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:10,800
of charged mercury remained in the tanks of 
Mars Center and 1950 in the tanks at Deenmor.

1666
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:17,120
The flight of five ships settled comfortably 
upon Phobos, while the three relieved of duty  

1667
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:23,599
started back to Jupiter. Immediately work 
was begun on the attack. The ships were  

1668
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:28,640
first landed on the near side, while the 
apparatus of the projectors was unloaded,  

1669
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:35,359
then the great ships moved around to the far 
side. Phobos of course rotated with one face  

1670
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:40,719
fixed irrevocably toward Mars itself, 
the other always to the cold of space.  

1671
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:48,480
Great power leads trailed beneath the ships, 
and to the dark side. Then there were huge  

1672
02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:54,479
water lines for cooling. On this almost weightless 
world, where the great ships weighing hundreds of  

1673
02:44:54,479 --> 02:45:00,000
thousands of tons on a planet, weighed so little 
they were frequently moved about by a single man,  

1674
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,920
the laying of five miles of water 
conduit was no impossibility.

1675
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:12,080
Then they were ready. Mars Center came 
first. Automatic devices kept the aim exact,  

1676
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:17,840
as the first of the magnetic bombs 
started down. At five-second intervals  

1677
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:24,240
they were projected outward, invisible globes 
of concentrated magnetic energy, undetectable  

1678
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:30,719
in space. Seven seconds passed before the first 
became dimly visible in the thin air of Mars.  

1679
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:38,480
It floated down, it would miss the fort it 
seemed—so far to one side— Abruptly it turned,  

1680
02:45:38,479 --> 02:45:43,519
and darted with tremendously accelerating 
speed for the great magnetic field of the fort.  

1681
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:52,319
With a vast blast of light, it exploded. Five 
seconds later a second exploded. And a third.

1682
02:45:54,399 --> 02:45:58,799
Mars Center signaled scoffingly that the 
bombs were all being stopped dead in the  

1683
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:03,520
magnetic atmosphere, after the bombardment 
had been witnessed from Earth and Luna.  

1684
02:46:04,319 --> 02:46:09,359
An hour later they gave a report that they were 
concentrated magnetic fields of energy that  

1685
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:14,719
would be rather dangerous—if it weren't that they 
couldn't even stand into the magnetic atmosphere.  

1686
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:22,161
Three hours later Mars Center reported that they 
contained considerably more energy than had at  

1687
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:28,160
first been thought. Further, which they had not 
carefully considered at first, they were taking  

1688
02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:33,519
energy with them! They were taking away about 
an equal amount of energy as each blew up.

1689
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:39,760
It was only a half-hour after that that the men 
at Mars Center realized perfectly what it meant.  

1690
02:46:40,640 --> 02:46:44,640
Their power was being drained just 
a little bit better than twice  

1691
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:51,840
as fast as they generated during the day—and 
since Phobos spun so swiftly across the sky.

1692
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:56,560
Deenmor got the attack just about 
the time Mars Center was released.  

1693
02:46:57,359 --> 02:47:03,359
Deenmor immediately began seeking for the 
source of it. Somewhere on Phobos—but where?

1694
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:10,720
The Mirans were experts at camouflage. 
Deenmor Station, realizing the menace,  

1695
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:16,560
immediately rayed the "projector." They tore up 
a great deal of harmless rock with their huge UV  

1696
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:21,600
rays. But the bomb device continued 
to throw one bomb each five seconds.

1697
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:28,720
When Deenmor operated from Phobos' position, Mars 
Center was exposed to the deadly, constant drain.  

1698
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:33,840
A day or two later, the bombs were 
coming one each second and a half,  

1699
02:47:34,479 --> 02:47:36,879
for more ships had joined in the work on Phobos.

1700
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:45,279
Gresth Gkae saw the work was going nicely. He knew 
that now it was only a question of time before  

1701
02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:53,439
those magnetic shields would fail—and then the 
whole fort would be powerless. Maybe—it might be  

1702
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:59,200
a good idea, when the forts were powerless to 
investigate instead of blowing them up. There  

1703
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:05,439
might be many interesting and worthwhile pieces 
of apparatus—particularly the UV beam's apparatus.

1704
02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:34,559
Buck Kendall entered the Communications room 
rather furtively. He hated the place. Cole was  

1705
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:41,040
there, and McLaurin. Mac was looking tired and 
drawn, Cole not so tired, but equally drawn.  

1706
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:46,800
The signals were coming through fairly well, 
because most of the disturbance was rising  

1707
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:51,600
where the signals rose, and all the disturbance, 
practically, was magnetic rather than electric.

1708
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:58,560
"Deenmor is sending, Buck," McLaurin said as he 
entered. "They're down to the last fifty-five  

1709
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:05,760
tons. They'll have more time now—a rest while 
Phobos sinks. Mars Center has another 250 tons,  

1710
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:09,760
but—it's just a question of time. 
Have you any hope to offer?"

1711
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:18,080
"No," said Kendall in a strained voice. "But, Mac, 
I don't think men like those are afraid to die.  

1712
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:25,920
It's dying uselessly they fear. Tell 'em—tell 
'em they've defended not alone Mars, but all  

1713
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:31,600
the system, in holding up the Strangers on Mars. 
We here on Luna have been safer because of them.  

1714
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:36,639
And tell—Mac, tell them that in the 
meantime, while they defended us,  

1715
02:49:36,640 --> 02:49:41,040
and gave us time to work, we have begun to 
see the trail that will lead to victory."

1716
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:44,479
"You have!" gasped McLaurin.

1717
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:52,240
"No—but they will never know!" Kendall left 
hastily. He went and stood moodily looking at the  

1718
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:59,679
calculator machines—the calculator machines that 
refused to give the answers he sought. No matter  

1719
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:06,000
how he might modify that original idea of his, no 
matter what different line of attack he might try  

1720
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:12,240
in solving the problems of Space and Matter, while 
he used the system he knew was right—the answer  

1721
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:17,359
came down to that deadly, hope-blasting 
expression that meant only "uncertain."

1722
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:22,960
Even Buck was beginning to feel uncertain 
under that constant crushing of hope.  

1723
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:29,359
Uncertainty—uncertainty was 
eating into him, and destroying—

1724
02:50:29,359 --> 02:50:32,399
From the Communications room 
came the hum and drive of the  

1725
02:50:32,399 --> 02:50:36,960
great sender flashing its message across 
seventy-two millions of miles of nothing.  

1726
02:50:38,319 --> 02:50:39,088
"B-u-c-k K-e-n-d-a-l-l s-a-y-s h-e 
h-a-s l-e-a-r-n-e-d s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g  

1727
02:50:39,089 --> 02:50:39,360
t-h-a-t w-i-l-l l-e-a-d t-o v-i-c-t-o-r-y 
w-h-i-l-e y-o-u h-e-l-d b-a-c-k t-h-e—"

1728
02:50:39,359 --> 02:50:56,639
Kendall switched on a noisy, 
humming fan viciously.  

1729
02:50:57,359 --> 02:51:00,559
The too-intelligible signals 
were drowned in its sound.

1730
02:51:01,359 --> 02:51:06,319
"And—tell them to—destroy the apparatus 
before the last of the power is gone,"  

1731
02:51:06,319 --> 02:51:07,920
McLaurin ordered softly.

1732
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:15,920
The men in Deenmor station did slightly better 
than that. Gradually they cut down their magnetic  

1733
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:21,279
shield, and some of the magnetic bombs tore 
and twisted viciously at the heavy metal walls.  

1734
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:26,559
The thin atmosphere of Mars 
leaked in. Grimly the men waited.  

1735
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:32,399
Atomic bombs—or ships to investigate? It 
did not matter much to them personally—

1736
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:39,040
Gresth Gkae smiled with his old vigor as he 
ordered one of the great interstellar ships to  

1737
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:44,399
land beside the powerless station, approaching 
from such an angle that the still-active Mars  

1738
02:51:44,399 --> 02:51:50,960
Center station could not attack. One of the fleet 
of Phobos rose, and circled about the planet, and  

1739
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:57,520
settled gracefully beside the station. For half an 
hour it lay there quietly, waiting and watching.  

1740
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:04,320
Then a crew of two dozen Mirans started 
across the dry, crumbly powder of Mars' sands,  

1741
02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:11,359
toward the fort. Simultaneously almost, 
three things happened. A three-foot UV  

1742
02:52:11,359 --> 02:52:17,599
beam wiped out the advancing party. A pair of 
fifteen-foot beams cut a great gaping hole in  

1743
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:22,000
the wall of the interstellar ship, as 
it darted up, like a startled quail,  

1744
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:25,680
its weapons roaring defiance, only 
to fall back, severely wounded.

1745
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:31,920
And the radio messages pounded out to Earth 
the first description of the Miran people.  

1746
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:38,000
Methodically the men in Deenmor station used 
all but one ton of their power to completely and  

1747
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:43,520
forever wreck and destroy the interstellar cripple 
that floundered for a few moments on the sands  

1748
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:51,440
a bare mile away. Presently, before Deenmor was 
through with it, the atomic bombs stopped coming,  

1749
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:56,240
and the atomic shells. The magnetic 
shield that had been re-established  

1750
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:59,439
for the few minutes of this 
last, dying sting, fell.

1751
02:53:00,560 --> 02:53:05,280
Deenmor station vanished in a sudden, 
colossal tongue of blue-green light  

1752
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:11,759
as the ton of atomically distorted mercury was 
exploded by a projector beam turned on the tank.

1753
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:17,679
It was long gone, when the first 
atomic bombs and magnetic bombs  

1754
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:23,840
dropped from Phobos reached the spot, and 
only hot rock and broken metal remained.

1755
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:30,960
Mars Center failed in fact the next time 
Phobos rode high over it. The apparatus here  

1756
02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:35,200
had been carefully destroyed by technicians 
with a view of making it indecipherable,  

1757
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:41,279
but the Mirans made it even more certain, 
for no ship settled here to investigate,  

1758
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:47,279
but a stream of atomic bombs that lasted for 
over an hour, and churned the rock to dust, and  

1759
02:53:47,279 --> 02:53:54,240
the dust to molten lava, in which pools of fused 
tungsten-beryllium alloy bubbled slowly and sank.

1760
02:53:56,080 --> 02:54:00,800
"Ah, Jarth—they are a brave race, 
whatever we may say of their queer shape,"  

1761
02:54:01,359 --> 02:54:06,240
sighed Gresth Gkae as the last of 
Mars Center sank in bubbling lava.  

1762
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:12,240
"They stung as they died." For 
some minutes he was silent.

1763
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:21,200
"We must move on," he said at length. "I have been 
thinking, and it seems best that a few ships land  

1764
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:26,960
here, and establish a fort, while some twenty 
move on to the satellite of the third planet  

1765
02:54:26,960 --> 02:54:33,840
and destroy the fort there. We cannot operate 
against the planet while that hangs above us."

1766
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:37,520
Seven ships settled to Mars, 
while the fleet came up from  

1767
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:41,760
Jupiter to join with Gresth Gkae's 
flight of ships on its way to Luna.

1768
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:48,880
An automatically controlled ship was sent ahead, 
and began the bombardment. It approached slowly,  

1769
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:54,960
and was not destroyed by the UV beams till it 
had come to within 40,000 miles of the fort.  

1770
02:54:56,240 --> 02:55:03,040
At 60,000 Gresth Gkae stationed his 
fleet—and returned to 150,000 immediately  

1771
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:08,240
as the titanic UV beams of the Lunar Fort 
stretched out to their maximum range.  

1772
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:15,920
The focus made a difference. One ship started 
limping back to Jupiter, in tow of a second,  

1773
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:21,279
while the rest began the slow, methodical work 
of wearing down the defenses of the Lunar Fort.

1774
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:25,920
Kendall looked out at the 
magnificent display of clashing,  

1775
02:55:25,920 --> 02:55:30,880
warring energies, the great, whirling 
spheres and discs of opalescent flame,  

1776
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:38,479
and turned away sadly. "The men at Deenmor must 
have watched that for days. And at Mars Center."

1777
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:42,160
"How long can we hold out?" asked McLaurin.

1778
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:49,599
"Three weeks or so, at the present rate. That's 
a long time, really. And we can escape if we  

1779
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:55,201
want to. The UV beams here have a greater 
range than any weapon the Strangers have,  

1780
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:59,439
and with Earth so near—oh, we 
could escape. Little good."

1781
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:01,600
"What are you going to do?"

1782
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:06,080
"I," said Buck Kendall, suddenly savage,  

1783
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:12,719
"am going to consign all the math machines 
in the universe to eternal damnation—and  

1784
02:56:13,359 --> 02:56:19,439
go ahead and build a machine anyway. I know 
that thing ought to be right. The math's wrong."

1785
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:22,640
"There is no other thing to try?"

1786
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:29,520
"A billion others. I don't know how many 
others. We ought to get atomic energy somehow.  

1787
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:35,599
But that thing infuriates me. A 
hundred things that math has predicted,  

1788
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:41,121
that I have checked by experiment, simple 
little things. But—when I carry it through  

1789
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:46,239
to the point where I can get something 
useful—it wriggles off into—uncertainty."

1790
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:53,200
Kendall stalked off to the laboratory. Devin 
was there working over the calculus machines,  

1791
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:59,279
and Kendall called him angrily. Then more 
apologetic, he explained it was anger at himself.  

1792
02:57:00,399 --> 02:57:06,080
"Devin, I'm going to make that thing, if it blows 
up and kills me. I'm going to make that thing if  

1793
02:57:06,080 --> 02:57:12,720
this whole fort blows up and kills me. That math 
has blown up in my face for four solid months,  

1794
02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:18,241
and half killed me, so I'm going to kill 
it. Come on, we'll make that damned junk."

1795
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:26,000
Angrily, furiously, Kendall drove his helpers 
to the task. He had worked out the apparatus  

1796
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:31,840
in plan a dozen times, and now he had the plans 
turned into patterns, the patterns into metal.

1797
02:57:33,359 --> 02:57:38,479
Saucily, the "S Doradus" made the trip to 
and from Earth with patterns, and with metal,  

1798
02:57:38,479 --> 02:57:43,200
with supplies and with apparatus. But 
she had to dodge and fight every inch  

1799
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:46,240
of the way as the Miran ships 
swooped down angrily at her.  

1800
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:52,240
A fighting craft could get through when the 
Miran fleet was withdrawn to some distance,  

1801
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:57,120
but the Mirans were careful that no heavy-loaded 
freighter bearing power supply should get through.

1802
02:57:58,479 --> 02:58:05,040
And Gresth Gkae waited off Luna in his great ship, 
and watched the steady streams of magnetic bombs  

1803
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:10,720
exploding on the magnetic shield of the 
Lunar Fort. Presently more ships came up,  

1804
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:16,640
and added their power to the attack, for here, the 
photo-cell banks could gather tremendous energy,  

1805
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:21,680
and Gresth Gkae knew he would need to overcome 
this, and drain the accumulated power.

1806
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:26,880
Gresth Gkae felt certain if 
he could once crack this nut,  

1807
02:58:26,880 --> 02:58:32,800
break down Earth, he would have the system. 
This was the home planet. If this fell,  

1808
02:58:33,439 --> 02:58:38,479
then the two others would follow easily, despite 
the fact that the few forts on the innermost  

1809
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:43,519
planet, Mercury, could gather energy from the sun 
at a rate greater than their ships could generate.

1810
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:49,519
It took Kendall two weeks and three days 
to set up his preliminary apparatus.  

1811
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:54,080
They had power for perhaps four 
days more, thanks to the fact that  

1812
02:58:54,080 --> 02:59:00,319
the long Lunar day had begun shortly after 
Gresth Gkae's impatient attack had started.  

1813
02:59:00,319 --> 02:59:06,080
Also, the "S Doradus" had brought in several 
hundred tons of charged mercury on each trip,  

1814
02:59:06,640 --> 02:59:12,161
though this was no great quantity individually, 
it had mounted up in the ten trips she had made.  

1815
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:18,080
The "Cepheid," her sister ship, had gone along 
on seven of the trips, and added to the total.

1816
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:23,920
But at length the apparatus was 
set up. It was peculiar looking,  

1817
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:28,800
and it employed a great deal of power, 
nearly as much as a UV beam in fact.  

1818
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:35,600
McLaurin looked at it sceptically toward the last, 
and asked Buck: "What do you expect it to do?"

1819
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:44,241
"I am," said Kendall sourly, "uncertain. 
The result will be uncertainty itself."

1820
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:50,000
Which, considering things, was a 
surprisingly accurate statement.  

1821
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:57,680
Kendall gave the exact answer. He meant to 
give an ironic comment. For the mathematics  

1822
02:59:57,680 --> 03:00:02,241
had been perfectly correct, only Buck 
Kendall misinterpreted the answer.

1823
03:00:03,760 --> 03:00:08,080
"I've followed the math with mechanism 
all the way through," he explained,  

1824
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:13,200
"and I'm putting power into it. That's all 
I know. Somewhere, by the laws of cause  

1825
03:00:13,200 --> 03:00:18,559
and effect, this power must show itself 
again—despite what the damn math says."

1826
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,080
And in that, of course, Kendall was wrong.  

1827
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:26,800
Because the laws of cause and effect 
didn't hold in what he was doing now.

1828
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:31,519
"Do you want to watch?" he asked 
at length. "I'm all set to try it."

1829
03:00:32,479 --> 03:00:35,200
"I suppose I may as well." McLaurin smiled.  

1830
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:39,680
"In our close-knit little community 
the fate of one is of interest to all.  

1831
03:00:40,399 --> 03:00:44,879
If it's going to blow up, I might as well 
be here, and if it isn't, I want to be."

1832
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:51,840
Kendall smiled appreciatively and replied: 
"Let it be on thy own head. Here she goes."

1833
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:58,000
He walked over to the power board, and 
took command. Devin, and a squad of other  

1834
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:03,359
scientists were seated about the room with every 
conceivable type and combination of apparatus.  

1835
03:01:03,920 --> 03:01:10,160
Kendall wanted to see what this was doing. 
"Tubes," he called. "Circuits A and D. Tie-ins."  

1836
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:18,160
He stopped, the preliminary switches in. 
"Main circuit coming." With a jerk he threw  

1837
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:25,920
over the last contact. A heavy relay thudded 
solidly. The hum of a straining atostor. Then—

1838
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:31,200
An electric motor, humming 
smoothly stopped with a jerk.  

1839
03:01:33,359 --> 03:01:40,240
"This," it remarked in a deep throaty voice, 
"is probably the last stand of humanity."

1840
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:45,599
The galvanometer before which 
Devin was seated apparently agreed.  

1841
03:01:46,319 --> 03:01:48,960
In a rather high pitched 
voice it pointed out that:  

1842
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:56,800
"If the Lunar Fort falls, the Earth—" It stopped 
abruptly, and an electroscope beside Douglass  

1843
03:01:56,800 --> 03:02:02,720
took up the thread in a high, shrill voice, 
rather slurred, "—will be directly attacked."

1844
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:09,840
"This," resumed the motor in a hoarse voice, 
"will certainly mean the end of humanity."  

1845
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:15,840
The motor gave up the discourse and 
hummed violently into action—in reverse!

1846
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:22,880
"My God!" Kendall pulled the switch open 
with a sagging jaw and staring eyes.

1847
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:27,840
The men in the room burst into 
sudden startled exclamations.

1848
03:02:29,279 --> 03:02:36,240
Kendall didn't give them time. His jaw snapped 
shut, and a blazing light of wondrous joy shone  

1849
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:44,240
in his eyes. He instantly threw the switch in 
again. Again the humming atostor, the strain—

1850
03:02:45,680 --> 03:02:53,120
Slowly Devin lifted from his seat. With thrashing 
arms and startled, staring eyes, he drifted gently  

1851
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:58,240
across the room. Abruptly he fell to the 
floor, unhurt by the light Lunar gravity.

1852
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:10,080
"I advise," said the motor in its grumbling voice, 
"an immediate exodus." It stopped speaking, and  

1853
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:17,120
practiced what it preached. It was a fifty-horse 
motor-generator, on a five-ton tungsten-beryllium  

1854
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:25,120
base, but it rose abruptly, spun rapidly about an 
axis at right angles to the axis of its armature,  

1855
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:30,559
and stopped as suddenly. In mid air 
it continued its interrupted lecture.  

1856
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:38,399
"Mercury therefore is the destination I would 
advise. There power is sufficient for—all  

1857
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:45,439
machines." Gently it inverted itself 
and settled to the middle of the floor.  

1858
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:53,840
Kendall instantly cut the switch. The relay 
did not chunk open. It refused to obey.  

1859
03:03:54,399 --> 03:03:59,200
Settled in the middle of the floor 
now, torn loose from its power leads,  

1860
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:06,399
the motor-generator began turning. It turned 
faster and faster. It was shrilling in a thin  

1861
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:12,080
scream of terrific speed, a speed that 
should have torn its windings to fragments  

1862
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:19,120
under the lash of centrifugal force. 
Contentedly it said throatily. "Settled."

1863
03:04:20,960 --> 03:04:28,000
The galvanometer spoke again in its peculiar 
harsh voice. "Therefore, move." Abruptly,  

1864
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:34,800
without apparent reason, the stubborn relay 
clicked open. The shrilly screaming motor stopped  

1865
03:04:34,800 --> 03:04:40,160
dead instantly, as though it had had no 
real momentum, or had been inertialess.

1866
03:04:41,279 --> 03:04:48,240
Startled, white-faced men looked at Kendall. 
Buck's eyes were shining with an unholy glee.

1867
03:04:49,359 --> 03:04:54,479
"Uncertainty!" he shouted. 
"Uncertainty—uncertainty—uncertainty,  

1868
03:04:55,040 --> 03:05:00,640
you fools! Don't you see it? All 
the math—it said uncertainty—man,  

1869
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:04,880
man—we've got just that—uncertainty!"

1870
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:11,280
"You're crazy," gasped McLaurin. 
"I'm crazy, everything's gone crazy."

1871
03:05:12,399 --> 03:05:15,279
Kendall roared with sudden, joyous laughter.  

1872
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:23,520
"Absolutely. Everything goes crazy—the laws of 
nature break down! Heisenberg's principle showed  

1873
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:30,161
that the law of cause and effect weren't 
absolute. We've made them absolutely uncertain!"

1874
03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:35,359
"But—but motors talking, 
instruments giving lectures—"

1875
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:43,040
"Certainly—or rather uncertainly—anything, 
absolutely anything. The destruction of  

1876
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:49,439
the laws of gravity, freedom from inertia—why, 
merely picking up a radio lecture is nothing!"

1877
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:57,360
Suddenly, abruptly, a thousand questions poured 
in on him. Jubilantly he answered what he could,  

1878
03:05:57,359 --> 03:06:03,679
told what he thought—and then brought order. 
"The battle's still on, men—we've still got  

1879
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:09,360
to find out how to use this, now we've got 
it. I have an idea—that there's a lot more.  

1880
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:15,359
I know what I'll get this time. Now help me remake 
this apparatus so we don't broadcast the thing."

1881
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:20,880
At once, ten times the former pace, work was done.  

1882
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:25,760
On the radio, news was sent out that 
Kendall was on the right track after all.  

1883
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:32,081
In two hours the apparatus had been 
vastly altered, it was in the final stage,  

1884
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:37,600
and an entirely different sort of field set up. 
Again they watched as Buck applied the power.

1885
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:43,440
The atostor hummed—but no strange 
tricks of matter happened this time.  

1886
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:48,720
The more concentrated, altered field 
was, as Buck was to find out later,  

1887
03:06:49,279 --> 03:06:55,840
"Uncertainty of the Second Degree." It 
was molecular uncertainty. In a field a  

1888
03:06:55,840 --> 03:07:02,880
foot and a half in diameter, Buck saw the thing 
created—and suddenly a brilliant green-blue flame  

1889
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:10,000
shot up, and a great dark cloud of terrible, 
red-brown deadly vapor. Then an instant later,  

1890
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:16,080
Kendall had opened the relay. Gasping, the men ran 
from the laboratory, shutting the deadly fumes in.  

1891
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:23,840
"N2O4" gasped Morton, the chemist, as they reached 
safety. "It's exothermic—but it formed there!"

1892
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:29,520
In that instant, Kendall grasped the 
meaning the choking fumes carried.  

1893
03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:37,840
"Molecular uncertainty!" he decided. 
"We're going back—we're getting there—"

1894
03:07:38,399 --> 03:07:42,479
He altered the apparatus again, 
added another atostor in series,  

1895
03:07:42,479 --> 03:07:49,359
reduced the size of his sphere of forces—of 
strange chaos of uncertainty. Within—little  

1896
03:07:49,359 --> 03:07:53,599
was certain. Without—the laws 
of nature applied as ever.

1897
03:07:54,960 --> 03:08:00,000
Again the apparatus was started, 
cautiously this time. Only a strange  

1898
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:06,080
jumbled ionization appeared this time, then 
a slow, rising blue flame began to creep up,  

1899
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:12,800
and burn hot and blue. Buck looked at it for a 
moment, then his face grew tense and thoughtful.  

1900
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:18,640
"Devin—give me a half-dollar." 
Blankly, Devin reached in his pocket,  

1901
03:08:18,640 --> 03:08:24,640
and handed over the metal disc. Cautiously Buck 
Kendall tossed it toward the sphere of force.  

1902
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:29,200
Instantly there was a flash of 
flame, soundless and soft-colored.  

1903
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:36,880
Then the silver disc was outlined in light, 
and swiftly, inevitably crumbling into dust so  

1904
03:08:36,880 --> 03:08:44,480
fine only a blue haze appeared. In less than two 
seconds, the metal was gone. Only the dense blue  

1905
03:08:44,479 --> 03:08:50,559
fog remained. Then this began to go, and the 
leaping blue flame grew taller, and stronger.

1906
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:56,000
"We're on the track—I'm going to stop 
here, and calculate. Bring the data—"

1907
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:01,840
Kendall shut off the machine, and went to 
the calculation room. Swiftly he selected  

1908
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:06,960
already prepared graphs, graphs of the math 
he had worked on. Devin came soon, and others.  

1909
03:09:07,840 --> 03:09:12,319
They assembled the data and with tables and 
arithmetical machines turned it into graphs.

1910
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:18,720
Then all these graphs were fed into the 
machine. There were curves, and sine-curves,  

1911
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:23,920
abrupt breaking lines—but the answer that 
came when all were compounded was a perfect  

1912
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:29,840
diagram of a flight of four steps, 
descending in unequal treads to zero.

1913
03:09:30,800 --> 03:09:36,640
Kendall looked at it for long minutes. "That," 
he said at length, "is what I expected.  

1914
03:09:37,279 --> 03:09:43,359
There are four degrees of uncertainty, we 
generated 'Uncertainty of the First Degree,'  

1915
03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:49,040
'Mass Uncertainty,' when we started. That, as 
here shown, takes little energy concentration.  

1916
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:54,640
Then we increased the energy concentration 
and got 'Uncertainty of the Second Degree,'  

1917
03:09:54,640 --> 03:10:00,240
'Molecular Uncertainty.' Then I added more power, 
and reduced the field, and got 'Uncertainty  

1918
03:10:00,239 --> 03:10:06,719
of the Third Degree'—'Atomic Uncertainty.' 
There is 'Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree.'  

1919
03:10:07,279 --> 03:10:12,160
It is barely attainable with our 
atostors. It is—utter uncertainty.

1920
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:18,800
"In the First Degree, the laws of mass 
action fail, the great broad-reaching laws.  

1921
03:10:20,080 --> 03:10:23,920
In the Second Degree, the laws of 
the molecules, a finer organization,  

1922
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:30,319
break down, and anything can happen in chemistry. 
In the Third Degree, the laws of atomic physics  

1923
03:10:30,319 --> 03:10:36,960
break down slowly. The atom is tough. It is 
very compact, and we just barely attained the  

1924
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:44,239
concentration needed with that apparatus. But—in 
the Third Degree, when the Atomic Laws break down  

1925
03:10:44,239 --> 03:10:51,279
into utter uncertainty, the atoms break, and 
only hydrogen can exist. That was the blue flame.

1926
03:10:52,160 --> 03:11:00,479
"But the Fourth Degree—there is no law 
whatsoever, nothing in all the Universe can exist.  

1927
03:11:01,279 --> 03:11:07,840
It means—the utter destruction and release of the 
energy of matter!" Kendall paused for a moment.  

1928
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:17,040
"We have won, with this. We need only make up this 
apparatus—and maybe make it into a weapon. You  

1929
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:22,399
know, in the Fourth Degree, nothing in all the 
Universe could resist, deflect, or control it,  

1930
03:11:22,399 --> 03:11:28,559
if launched freely, and self-maintaining. 
I think that might be done. You see,  

1931
03:11:28,560 --> 03:11:35,280
no law affects it, for it breaks down the law. 
Magnetism cannot attract or repel it because  

1932
03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:40,479
magnetic fields cannot exist; there is no 
law of magnetic force, where this field is.

1933
03:11:41,359 --> 03:11:46,000
"And you know, Devin, how I have analyzed 
and duplicated their magnetic ball-fields.  

1934
03:11:46,560 --> 03:11:50,080
This should be capable of 
formation into a ball-field.

1935
03:11:50,960 --> 03:11:56,480
"We need only make it up now. We will install 
it in the 'S Doradus' and the 'Cepheid'  

1936
03:11:56,479 --> 03:12:03,839
as a weapon. We need only install it as 
an energy source here. Let us start."

1937
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:30,799
Buck Kendall with a slow smile, looked out of the 
port in the thick metal wall. The magnetic shield  

1938
03:12:30,800 --> 03:12:37,680
of the Lunar Fort was washed constantly with 
the fires of exploding magnetic bombs. The smile  

1939
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:46,400
spread broader. "My friends," he said softly, 
"you can pull from now till doomsday as far as I'm  

1940
03:12:46,399 --> 03:12:53,200
concerned, and you won't even disturb us now." He 
looked back over his shoulder into the power room.  

1941
03:12:53,920 --> 03:12:59,680
A hunched bulk, beautifully designed and carefully 
finished, the apparatus that created 'Uncertainty  

1942
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:05,920
of the Fourth Degree' was destroying matter, and 
creating by its destruction terrific electric  

1943
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:12,160
fields. These fields were feeding the magnetic 
shield now. Under the present drain, the machine  

1944
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:18,559
was not noticeably working. In fact, Kendall 
was a bit annoyed. He had tested out the energy  

1945
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:24,400
generating properties of this machine, trying to 
find a limit. He had found there was no limit.  

1946
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:30,800
The great copper conductors, charged with the same 
atostor force that was used in the mercury fuel,  

1947
03:13:30,800 --> 03:13:36,880
were perfect conductors, they had not heated. 
But the eleven thousand tons of discharged  

1948
03:13:36,880 --> 03:13:41,840
mercury metal had been completely charged 
in just a bit better than eleven minutes.  

1949
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:46,880
The pumps wouldn't force it through the 
charging apparatus any faster than that.

1950
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:52,399
Two weeks more had passed, while 
the "S Doradus" and the "Cepheid"  

1951
03:13:52,399 --> 03:13:58,399
were fitted out with the new apparatus Buck had 
designed. They were almost ready to start now.

1952
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:02,239
McLaurin came down the corridor, 
and stopped near Kendall.  

1953
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:07,680
He too smiled at the Miran's attempts. 
"They've got a long way to go, Buck."

1954
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:12,720
"They're going a long way. Clear back home—and  

1955
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:16,320
we'll be right along. I don't 
think they can outdistance us."

1956
03:14:17,439 --> 03:14:21,599
"I still don't see why you couldn't use 
one of those Uncertainty conditions—the  

1957
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:24,320
First Degree perhaps, and annihilate our inertia."

1958
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:30,639
"You can't control Uncertainty. By its 
essential character it's beyond control."

1959
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:36,000
"What's that Fourth Degree machine 
of yours—the material energy—if it  

1960
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,319
isn't controlled and utilized Uncertainty?"

1961
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:44,399
"It's utter and utterly uncontrolled 
Uncertainty. The matter within that field  

1962
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:52,160
breaks down to absolutely nothing. Within, no 
law whatsoever applies, but fortunately, outside  

1963
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:58,160
the old laws of physics apply—and we can gather 
and use the energy which is released outside,  

1964
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:04,559
though nothing can be done inside. Why, think, 
man, if I could control that Uncertainty, I  

1965
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:11,201
could do anything at all, absolutely anything. It 
would be a world as unreasonable as a bad dream.  

1966
03:15:12,399 --> 03:15:16,000
Think how unreasonable those 
manifestations we first got were!"

1967
03:15:17,359 --> 03:15:19,839
"But can't you get any control at all?"

1968
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:27,680
"Very little. Anyway, if I could get inertialess 
conditions at will, I'd be afraid of them. They'd  

1969
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:32,000
make chemical reactions impossible in 
all probability—and life is chemical.  

1970
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:37,120
Two atoms must come into more or less 
violent contact before a union takes place,  

1971
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:40,400
and cannot if they have 
neither momentum nor inertia.

1972
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:45,760
"Anyway—why worry. I can't do it, 
because I can't control this thing.  

1973
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:48,080
And we have the extra-space drive."

1974
03:15:49,359 --> 03:15:53,519
"How does that darned thing work? Can't 
you drop the math and tell me about it?"

1975
03:15:54,640 --> 03:16:00,161
Kendall smiled. "Not too readily. Remember 
first, as to the driving system, that it  

1976
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:08,000
works on the fabric of space. Space is, in the 
physical sense, a fabric woven of the threads of  

1977
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:14,960
lines of force from every body in the universe, 
made up of fields and forces. It is elastic,  

1978
03:16:14,960 --> 03:16:20,960
and can transmit strains. But anything that 
can transmit strains, can be strained against.  

1979
03:16:21,760 --> 03:16:25,760
With the tremendous field intensities 
available by the material engines,  

1980
03:16:26,319 --> 03:16:30,799
I can get such fields as will 'dig 
their toes' into space and push.

1981
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:32,720
"That's the drive itself.  

1982
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:38,560
It is accelerationless, because it enfolds 
us, and acts equally on every atom of us.  

1983
03:16:39,279 --> 03:16:45,200
By maintaining in addition a slight artificial 
gravity—thanks also to the intensity of those  

1984
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:50,800
material engine fields—we can be comfortable, 
while we accelerate at tremendous rates.

1985
03:16:51,840 --> 03:16:57,680
"That is, I think, at least allied to the 
Stranger's system. For the high-speed drive,  

1986
03:16:57,680 --> 03:17:05,440
I do in fact use the Uncertainty. I can control 
it in a certain sense by determining its powers,  

1987
03:17:05,439 --> 03:17:09,359
and the limits of uncertainty, whether 
First, Second, Third or Fourth Degree.  

1988
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:15,920
It advances in jumps—but on a finer plotting 
of the curve, you can see that each jump  

1989
03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:22,720
represents a vast series of smaller jumps. That 
is, there is Class A, B, C, D, and so forth  

1990
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:28,800
Uncertainty of the First Degree. Now Class A First 
Degree Uncertainty involves only the deepest,  

1991
03:17:28,800 --> 03:17:35,279
broadest principles. Only they break down. 
One of these is the law of the speed of light.

1992
03:17:36,239 --> 03:17:38,800
"I'm sure that isn't the system the Strangers use,  

1993
03:17:38,800 --> 03:17:41,600
but I'm also sure there's no 
limit to the speed we can get."

1994
03:17:42,720 --> 03:17:44,480
"Doesn't that wreck your drive system?"

1995
03:17:45,359 --> 03:17:48,960
"No, because gravity and the 
fields I use in driving are  

1996
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:51,760
First Degree Uncertainties of the higher classes.

1997
03:17:52,479 --> 03:17:57,120
"But at any rate, it will work. And—I suspect 
you came to say you were ready to go."

1998
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:59,600
"I did." McLaurin nodded.

1999
03:18:00,399 --> 03:18:02,080
"Still stick to your original plan?"

2000
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:08,319
McLaurin nodded. "I think it's best. You 
follow those fellows back to their system  

2001
03:18:08,319 --> 03:18:13,200
in the 'S Doradus' and I'll stay here in the 
'Cepheid' to protect the system. They may  

2002
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:19,200
need some time to get out of the place here. And 
remember, we ought to be as decent as they were.  

2003
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:24,000
They didn't bother the transports leaving Jupiter 
when they came in, only attacked the warships.  

2004
03:18:24,560 --> 03:18:30,480
We're bound to do the same, but we'll have to keep 
a watch on them, nonetheless. So you go on ahead."

2005
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:36,880
They started down the corridor, and came presently 
to the huge locks where the "S Doradus" and the  

2006
03:18:36,880 --> 03:18:43,840
"Cepheid" were berthed. The super-ships lay 
cold and gray now, men swarming in and out with  

2007
03:18:43,840 --> 03:18:50,880
last-minute supplies. Air, water, spare parts, 
bedding and personal equipment. Douglass, Cole,  

2008
03:18:50,880 --> 03:18:56,640
and most of the laboratory staff would go with 
Kendall when he followed the Strangers home. Devin  

2009
03:18:56,640 --> 03:19:00,640
and a few of the most advanced physicists 
would stay with McLaurin in case of need.

2010
03:19:02,720 --> 03:19:09,280
An hour later the "S Doradus" rose gently, 
soundlessly from her berth, and floated out of the  

2011
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:16,960
open lock-door. The "Cepheid" followed her in five 
seconds. Still under the great screen of the fort,  

2012
03:19:16,960 --> 03:19:22,560
the lashing, coruscating colors of the magnetic 
bombs and the magnetic screen flashed and was  

2013
03:19:22,560 --> 03:19:28,640
iridescent. The "S Doradus" poked her great 
nose gently through the screen, and an instant  

2014
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:35,120
later her titanically powerful, material-engine 
effortlessly discharged a great magnetic bomb,  

2015
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:39,840
sent with the combined power of five 
atomic-powered interstellar ships.  

2016
03:19:40,960 --> 03:19:46,560
The two ships separated now, the "Cepheid" under 
McLaurin flashing ahead with sudden, terrific  

2017
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:52,800
acceleration toward Mars, whispering through space 
at a speed that made it undetectable, faster than  

2018
03:19:52,800 --> 03:20:00,000
light. The "S Doradus" journeyed out leisurely 
toward the fleet of forty-seven Miran ships.

2019
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:04,160
Gresth Gkae saw the "S Doradus" and 
as he watched the steady progress,  

2020
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:09,360
felt sudden fear at his heart. 
The ship seemed so certain—

2021
03:20:10,960 --> 03:20:17,439
At a distance of thirty thousand miles, Kendall 
stopped. Magnetic bombs were washing his screen  

2022
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:22,319
continuously now, seeking to exhaust 
the ship as all the great ships beyond  

2023
03:20:22,319 --> 03:20:27,279
poured their energy against it. A 
slow smile spread over Kendall's mouth  

2024
03:20:27,279 --> 03:20:33,679
as he heard the gentle hum of the barely working 
material-engine. Carefully he aligned the nose  

2025
03:20:33,680 --> 03:20:39,360
UV beam of the "S Doradus" on the nearest of 
the Miran ships. Then he depressed a switch.

2026
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:47,600
There was no ion-release before the force-mirror 
now. Just a jet of gas whirling into a half-inch  

2027
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:53,600
field of "Uncertainty of the Fourth Degree." 
The matter vanished instantly in released  

2028
03:20:53,600 --> 03:20:59,840
energy so stupendous that the greatest previous 
UV beams had been harmless things by comparison.  

2029
03:21:01,359 --> 03:21:07,839
Material energy maintained the mirror forces. 
Material energy gave the power that was released.  

2030
03:21:07,840 --> 03:21:14,560
And only material energy could have stood 
up before it. Thirty thousand miles away,  

2031
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:21,520
a Miran ship flamed instantaneously into 
inconceivable incandescence, vanishing almost  

2032
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:27,360
in blue-violet light of terrific intensity. 
The ship reeled away, a half-molten wreck.

2033
03:21:28,960 --> 03:21:31,760
The beam spotted two more 
ships before it winked out.  

2034
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:39,920
Then Kendall began sending bombs. He moved up to 
within 2000 miles that his aim might be accurate.  

2035
03:21:40,800 --> 03:21:46,800
They were bombs of "Uncertainty of the Third 
Degree," the Uncertainty of atomic law in bomb  

2036
03:21:46,800 --> 03:21:53,200
form. One hit the nose of the nearest ship, and 
a sphere five feet in diameter glowed mistily  

2037
03:21:53,200 --> 03:21:59,200
blue for a moment. Then very easily, the matter 
that formed the wall of the cruiser began to run  

2038
03:21:59,200 --> 03:22:04,479
and change, and presently there was only 
a hole, and an expanding cloud of gas.  

2039
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:11,200
Three more flowed toward it—and the hole enlarged, 
and another hole appeared in a bulkhead behind.

2040
03:22:13,439 --> 03:22:19,120
Kendall made a change. For the first time 
there came the staccato bark of the material  

2041
03:22:19,120 --> 03:22:25,519
engine under strain, as it fashioned the terrific 
fields of "Uncertainty of the Ultimate Degree."  

2042
03:22:26,319 --> 03:22:30,479
Abruptly they leapt out, invisible 
till they entered a magnetic screen,  

2043
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:36,399
then run over with opalescent light as the energy 
of the field was sucked into them and released.

2044
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:42,080
It struck the nose of a ship—a 
field no larger than an apple—

2045
03:22:43,439 --> 03:22:50,479
A titanic gout of energy burst out that was 
soundless in space. The ship suddenly opened back,  

2046
03:22:50,479 --> 03:22:55,519
opened like the peel of a banana, till a 
little nub remained at the further end,  

2047
03:22:55,520 --> 03:23:02,480
and the metal flaps dropped back across and 
behind it dejectedly. A second ship was struck,  

2048
03:23:02,479 --> 03:23:06,639
and it was struck on one side, so that it 
was shattered like a spent firecracker.

2049
03:23:08,319 --> 03:23:11,200
Then the Miran fleet vanished in speed.

2050
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:16,560
Kendall followed them. "I 
think," he said with a grin,  

2051
03:23:17,279 --> 03:23:22,160
"they tried to use their radio beam, but it 
spread too much to do anything at that distance.  

2052
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:27,439
And they used their rotating magnetic field, which 
we couldn't feel. And their crumbler ray too,  

2053
03:23:27,439 --> 03:23:34,319
of course. I wonder—are they headed only 
for Jupiter? No—no, they've passed it!"

2054
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:41,680
Faster than light, faster than energy could 
follow through space, or Uncertainty Bombs pursue,  

2055
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:47,600
the Mirans were fleeing for home. They 
knew now that only in speed lay safety.  

2056
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:53,920
Already they knew that a similar ship had appeared 
off Jupiter, and, after wiping out the Phobos and  

2057
03:23:53,920 --> 03:23:59,760
Mars stations with one bomb each, had cleared the 
Jovian Satellites with equal terrible efficiency.

2058
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:06,960
In one of the fleeing ships was a broken, 
tired old man, and his staff. Gresth Gkae  

2059
03:24:06,960 --> 03:24:12,640
looked back at the blank, distorted space behind 
them, at the swiftly dwindling sun, and spoke.  

2060
03:24:14,080 --> 03:24:20,720
"I was at fault, my friends. Jarth has spoken. 
They are the stronger and the wiser race.  

2061
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:26,880
Farth Skalt has shown you—they 
use space fields of intensity 100.  

2062
03:24:26,880 --> 03:24:33,920
That means the energy of the ultimate destruction. 
Jarth used us as his instrument of testing,  

2063
03:24:33,920 --> 03:24:39,840
only to drive and stimulate that race. I do 
not—nay. There is no doubt now, for look."

2064
03:24:41,439 --> 03:24:45,919
Plainly visible, rapidly overtaking 
them, the "S Doradus" appeared sharp,  

2065
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:48,239
and luminous on the jet of distorted space.

2066
03:24:49,680 --> 03:24:55,360
"We cannot escape, my friends. Shall we 
return to Sthor or remain in space, lost?"

2067
03:24:57,200 --> 03:25:02,960
"Let us deflect our course—at least he may not 
know our destination." The interstellar ship  

2068
03:25:02,960 --> 03:25:10,239
turned very slightly in her course. Plainly they 
saw the "S Doradus" flash on, in a straight line,  

2069
03:25:10,239 --> 03:25:16,000
headed for distant, red-glowing Mira. 
Gresth Gkae watched, and shrugged.  

2070
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:23,680
Silently he put the ship back on its course, at 
its utmost speed. Parallel with them, near to  

2071
03:25:23,680 --> 03:25:29,680
them, the "S Doradus" flashed on. Day after day, 
the two hurled through space faster than light.  

2072
03:25:30,640 --> 03:25:33,920
Gradually Mira brightened, 
and at last became a disc.

2073
03:25:33,920 --> 03:25:40,000
Gresth Gkae slowed his ships, and Kendall, 
watching, slowed to match his speed.  

2074
03:25:41,120 --> 03:25:47,439
Five billion miles from Sthor, they had reached 
normal space speeds. Viciously the Miran fleet  

2075
03:25:47,439 --> 03:25:53,679
attacked the lone ship from Earth. Their rays, 
their bombs, their every weapon was flaming. Great  

2076
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:58,880
interstellar ships flashed suddenly into speeds 
greater than that of light, seeking to ram and  

2077
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:05,359
destroy the smaller ship. The "S Doradus" flashed 
into equal or greater speed, and eluded them.

2078
03:26:06,880 --> 03:26:09,680
Kendall had determined now, 
which was the leader's ship.

2079
03:26:11,120 --> 03:26:18,399
Gresth Gkae watched dully as his ships attempted 
to destroy the single, small ship. He sighed  

2080
03:26:18,399 --> 03:26:24,479
in resignation, and turned to walk back to the 
chapel aboard the ship. One last prayer to Jarth—

2081
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:32,960
Gresth Gkae stopped abruptly. The great ship 
was lurching strangely. Men shouted sudden,  

2082
03:26:32,960 --> 03:26:37,920
frightened cries. The clanking and thud 
of relays sounded, the shrill of alarms.  

2083
03:26:38,560 --> 03:26:44,960
Then the alarms stopped, and suddenly the whole 
great ship vibrated to an infinitely deep voice  

2084
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:51,200
speaking in perfect Sthorian. The voice 
remarked solemnly, in great, vibrant tones,  

2085
03:26:51,920 --> 03:26:55,760
that they would certainly receive 
news presently from the Expeditions.  

2086
03:26:57,120 --> 03:27:01,599
It went on for some seconds to discuss the 
conditions as reported in the new system.  

2087
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:08,960
Then it stopped abruptly. An electric motor just 
above Gresth Gkae's head suddenly hummed into  

2088
03:27:08,960 --> 03:27:16,160
action without reason or power connection. Almost 
simultaneously he heard the shouts of startled men  

2089
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:19,840
as the great lock doors began to 
open into space of their own accord,  

2090
03:27:20,479 --> 03:27:24,719
bulkhead doors slipped shut as the roar 
of escaping air echoed in the ship.

2091
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:31,440
Then it was all over. Gresth 
Gkae ran to the control room.  

2092
03:27:32,239 --> 03:27:34,880
The Mirans there looked up 
at him with drawn faces.

2093
03:27:36,399 --> 03:27:42,160
"The instruments—Gresth Gkae—the instruments. 
The instruments read impossible things,  

2094
03:27:42,800 --> 03:27:48,880
the motors worked without reason, the fields 
fluctuated—the atomic engines stopped and the  

2095
03:27:48,880 --> 03:27:53,440
magnetic shield broke down and gripped part of 
the ship instead!" reported the bewildered pilot.

2096
03:27:54,960 --> 03:28:02,080
"I do not know—some strange weapon of—" began 
the old scientist. Something luminous and huge  

2097
03:28:02,080 --> 03:28:07,920
twisted suddenly through space toward them, 
a bomb of "Uncertainty of the First Degree."  

2098
03:28:08,880 --> 03:28:15,040
It wrapped the ship silently—and again 
strange things happened. Abruptly the  

2099
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:21,120
ship started whirling violently, yet without 
centrifugal force. The heavens wheeled crazily,  

2100
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:26,880
and turned about three axes simultaneously. 
There was no gyroscopic effect to hold them!

2101
03:28:28,960 --> 03:28:33,760
Gradually the thing died out. Then a 
great field seemed to catch the ship,  

2102
03:28:33,760 --> 03:28:41,280
and hurl it away from its companions. Abruptly the 
pilot applied all his power to pull free. In vain.

2103
03:28:42,479 --> 03:28:47,200
Gresth Gkae shook his head slowly, and 
raised the pilot's hands from the board.  

2104
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:54,080
"Let them do as they will. I think they 
mean us no real harm, Thart Kralt. They can,  

2105
03:28:54,080 --> 03:28:59,440
we know, destroy us in an instant. Perhaps 
he wants us to go somewhere with him"—Gresth  

2106
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:05,920
Gkae smiled sadly—"and anyway, we can do nothing."

2107
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:11,359
For nearly a billion miles the great ship was 
hurled through space at tremendous normal-space  

2108
03:29:11,359 --> 03:29:18,639
velocity. Then abruptly it was halted, without a 
sign of strain or hurt. The great twenty-foot UV  

2109
03:29:18,640 --> 03:29:24,400
beam on the nose of the "S Doradus" broke into 
glowing gentle red light. It flashed twice.  

2110
03:29:25,359 --> 03:29:32,559
There was a pause. Then it flashed four 
times. A long wait. Then three times,  

2111
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:41,840
a pause and nine times. A wait. Four times, 
a pause, sixteen times. Then it stopped.

2112
03:29:44,399 --> 03:29:53,359
A slow smile of ineffable joy spread over Gresth 
Gkae's face. "Jarth Be Praised. He can destroy,  

2113
03:29:53,359 --> 03:30:00,960
but does not wish to. Ah, Thart Kralt, turn your 
spotlight toward him, and flash it twenty-five  

2114
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:08,239
times, for he is trying to start communications 
with us. Jarth is wise beyond all understanding.  

2115
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:14,399
They were the weaker race, and they are 
the stronger. But also they are the better,  

2116
03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:19,279
for they could destroy, and they do 
not, but seek only to communicate."
 
 
 
 

2117
03:30:23,800 --> 03:33:21,648
- THE END -
