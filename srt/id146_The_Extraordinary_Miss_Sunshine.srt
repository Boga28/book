00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,520
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,480
A New School

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,440
Parents and grandparents say that the years you 
spend at school are the best years of your life.  

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,000
Maybe it's true for some young people, 
but it wasn't like that for me...  

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,920
not at the beginning anyway.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,360
My name is Alice May and I'm eleven years 
old. I lived with my family in London  

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,040
until my father got a new job in St Ives. 
We moved to beautiful Cornwall one summer.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,200
This is my story.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,880
The sun shone over St Ives, a seaside town 
in Cornwall. It was a busy fishing port.  

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,440
There were small stone houses and white 
sandy beaches. Lots of families lived there.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,960
The town needed a bigger, more important school, 
so a famous architect designed a secondary school.  

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,720
The school was for children 
between the ages of eleven  

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,240
and eighteen. It was called 
The Fairbrother Academy.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,200
The architect was very clever 
and he also loved music.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
'Every school needs a concert hall 
with a stage and lights,' he said.  

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
The concert hall he created was wonderful.  

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,400
He also built a large gym, art studios, computer 
rooms and classrooms that were big and bright.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,920
The outside of the school was beautiful. There was 
a large front door and lions around a fountain.  

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,480
There were gardens and playgrounds 
and birds sang in the trees.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Some of the children who came to The Fairbrother 
Academy didn't want to learn. They were not  

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,240
interested in French or Latin, Maths or History. 
They pushed their classmates in the playground  

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,240
and called them bad names. These children were 
good when they were at home with their parents,  

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
but terrible when they came to school.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
I can hardly sleep before the 
first day at my new school  

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,400
The Fairbrother Academy. I am excited 
and nervous all at the same time.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,320
In the morning, when I walk into my 
classroom, I see a group of girls.  

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,960
They are talking together. They 
stop speaking when I come in.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,320
'Hello,' I say. 'I'm Alice.'

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,960
The girls don't smile. Their eyes are cold. One 
of the girls called Iris Fudge, who has an angry  

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,640
face, comes close. She looks at my long dark 
hair and blue eyes. Then she makes a scary face  

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,880
and runs back to her best friend 
Roxy Miller and the group of girls.

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,280
'Don't go near her. She bites!' Iris says.

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,680
They won't talk to me because I have braces 
on my teeth. They call me 'Shark Face'.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,720
I don't look very happy when I arrive home 
from school. My parents see my sad face.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
'How was school?' they ask.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
'Fine,' I say.

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,680
They ask me about friends and I tell 
them about the girls in my class  

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,960
and the fun things we do together. It isn't true. 
I can't tell them what school is really like.  

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,360
If dad speaks to the teachers 
everything will become worse.

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,280
Every day there is trouble in our classroom. The 
bullies don't like children who are clever and do  

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,920
well at school or children who wear glasses. They 
want kids in their group who are not very nice to  

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,160
teachers. They like children who don't do their 
homework. They think only bad children are cool.

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,720
It isn't only the group of girls who are bullies. 
There is a boy gang too. Their leader is Dexter  

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,640
Crane. He's very tall. Dexter pushes his 
classmates when they are in the playground.  

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,160
His friends, Ajax McCoy and Blaze Fenton, 
watch and laugh. They stand behind him.

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,640
At home in our house, a little bird 
sings in the tree near my bedroom window.  

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,280
She sees me crying and I 
tell her what school is like.  

48
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,320
The little bird shakes her head. 
She doesn't like it at all.
 
 
 

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880
CHAPTER TWO

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,040
Isadora Sunshine

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,920
The little bird flies across the fields, to an old 
house near the sea. The windows of the house are  

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,960
open and the little bird flies in and rests 
on a bookcase. It is Miss Sunshine's house.

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Miss Isadora Sunshine has golden hair and bright 
green eyes. She is standing in front of a canvas,  

54
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,200
surrounded by paints and brushes. She is 
painting a picture of a storm and sailing boats.

55
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
She has paint on her face and on her 
clothes, but the painting is wonderful.

56
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,760
When Miss Sunshine sees the little bird 
fly in, she puts her brush on the table.  

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,120
She takes some bread and puts it in a 
dish. She brings the bird some water.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,440
'How lovely to see you,' says Miss 
Sunshine. She knows from the way the  

59
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,480
bird jumps from one foot to the other that 
she has something important to tell her.

60
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,400
'Tell me. What's the matter?' she says.

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Miss Sunshine sits on a chair 
and the little bird sings a sad  

62
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
song of trouble. When she 
finishes Miss Sunshine stands up.

63
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,160
'How sad,' she says. 'You were right to 
tell me. We can do something to help.'

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,960
Miss Sunshine packs a bag with music books, 
art brushes and strange musical instruments.  

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
She puts her bag in the car and starts the engine.

66
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
'Hold on tight,' she says to the little bird.  

67
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,640
'It will only take forty-five 
minutes to drive to the school.'

68
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
She drives to St Ives.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,720
Before I continue with the story, I must tell you 
about the head teacher at The Fairbrother Academy.

70
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,920
How can I describe him? He is not a handsome man.  

71
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,360
His face is a bit like your reflection when you 
look in a kettle - sort of squashed. He is thin,  

72
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,680
and has long legs. His name is James Weak and his 
name describes his character. He is weak by name  

73
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,160
and weak by nature. Some people say he is 
a good head teacher. Others say he doesn't  

74
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,560
answer his emails. He is busy in his office 
every day playing scrabble on his computer.

75
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,280
On this particular day his secretary, Miss Baxter, 
knocks on the door. 'There's a lady to see you.'

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,440
'Oh, really? I wasn't expecting 
anyone. What lady?' says Mr Weak.

77
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
'Miss Isadora Sunshine.'

78
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,960
Mr Weak looks up because the moment he hears 
the name 'Sunshine', he begins to feel happy.  

79
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
'Send her in, Miss Baxter.'

80
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,760
Miss Isadora Sunshine is wearing a yellow dress  

81
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,040
and she smells of sweet flowers. She 
shakes Mr Weak's hand and sits down.

82
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,840
'I am here for the job of 
music teacher,' she says.

83
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:44,320
Mr Weak is confused. 'Um, I don't think there 
is a job as music teacher at the school.'

84
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,520
'Yes, there is,' shouts Miss Baxter from her 
office. 'You have an email this morning from  

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,800
the old music teacher', she says. She appears 
with a printed letter. 'He left yesterday.'

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,200
Mr Weak looks even more surprised. 'Well, 
then yes - there is a job at the school.  

87
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
We are looking for a music teacher.'

88
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,720
'I want good behaviour in the 
classroom,' says Miss Sunshine.

89
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,640
'Of course,' says Mr Weak. 'But we 
are a friendly school, Miss Sunshine.  

90
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,720
We allow children to call 
teachers by their first names.'

91
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,640
Miss Sunshine smiles and shakes her head. 'I'm 
sorry, Mr Weak, but I won't allow that in my  

92
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:41,440
classroom. Respect is very important and I am 
here as their teacher, not as their best friend.'

93
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:51,440
'I see,' says Mr Weak. He looks confused. 
'There may be other candidates,' he says  

94
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
in a voice weak as water.

95
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,640
'Mr Weak, there are no other candidates 
and there is no one better than me.'

96
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,320
Mr Weak looks at Miss Sunshine. He 
agrees but he doesn't say anything.

97
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,960
'So,' Miss Sunshine says. 'If 
there are no more questions,  

98
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:21,840
I would like a copy of my timetable, 
so that I can start this minute.'
 
 
 

99
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
CHAPTER THREE

100
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
A Classroom of Sunshine

101
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,400
No one talks to me at school. I feel alone 
as I stand at the side of the playground.  

102
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,920
There are the cool kids and there are the 
ones people don't speak to - children who  

103
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,920
are different. I want to speak to them, 
but I'm afraid of Iris Fudge and her gang.

104
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
The teachers know there's trouble in our class but  

105
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
they don't see children push their 
classmates or hear the bad names.  

106
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,160
The bullies are clever. Sometimes we speak to 
a teacher, one who has an understanding face.

107
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
'Write everything down,'  

108
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,320
the teacher says to us. 'I will make a 
report and pass it on to the head teacher.'

109
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,760
We write a letter but nothing happens. Things 
are getting worse. The bullies can contact me  

110
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,080
in cyberspace at every moment of the day 
and night. Why can't they leave me alone!

111
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,240
And then Miss Sunshine comes into my life.

112
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,320
Children stop talking and texting when she walks 
into the music room in her yellow dress. Her  

113
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,840
hair is long and golden. She ties it with a silk 
scarf. She smiles at us and looks at every child.

114
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,160
She says, 'Good Morning,' then waits.

115
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,320
We look at each other. Why is she waiting?  

116
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,480
Then we realise and we stand up. Dexter is the 
last one to stand up. He doesn't look happy.

117
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,400
'No phones during my lesson.' Miss Sunshine 
has a box and envelopes with our names on.  

118
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,840
We don't want to give her our 
phones. Dexter and Ajax are angry.

119
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,880
When Miss Sunshine walks past 
us there is a lovely perfume.  

120
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,840
It's the smell of grass and sweet summer flowers. 
She asks us our names and doesn't forget them.  

121
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,320
When she gives us our homework 
we have to say 'thank you.'

122
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,960
It's our first music lesson and Miss 
Sunshine wants us to speak about music.  

123
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,520
'What music do you like?'

124
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
Roxy stands up. 'I hate classical music.'

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,160
'Hate is a very strong word, Roxy. 
We don't hate anyone or anything.  

126
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
Why don't you like classical music?'

127
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,960
'There are too many notes,' 
she says and her friends laugh.

128
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:10,320
'I understand your opinion, Roxy. Classical 
music is difficult. There are a lot of notes.'

129
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,160
'I play jazz with my piano teacher,' Roxy says.

130
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,160
I can feel surprise in the classroom and I 
see Miss Sunshine smiling. 'Good,' she says.

131
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,160
'What about rap music?' Ajax McCoy 
says. 'Now rap music is clever.'

132
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
'Why is it clever, Ajax?' Miss Sunshine asks.

133
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,040
'Rap artists' songs are like poetry. 
Each rap song has a message.'

134
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
'I like musical theatre,' says Blaze.

135
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,040
'I saw the musical Cats once,' says Ajax.

136
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,840
'Any other important 
musicians?' asks Miss Sunshine.

137
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
Someone says 'The Beatles.' The class says 'No.'

138
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
'You're right,' says Miss Sunshine.  

139
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,640
'The Beatles were important for all 
the music that came after them.'

140
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,720
'What about Ed Sh-Sh-Sheeran,' says 
Naomi with a stutter. She never speaks.

141
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:18,880
'Excellent, Naomi. Ed Sheeran was really 
good at music when he was a small child,  

142
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,920
like Mozart. He started singing in 
his local church at the age of four.'

143
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,840
Everyone is good in that first lesson. It's the 
second lesson when it all begins to go wrong.
 
 
 

144
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,560
CHAPTER FOUR

145
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,120
Imagine

146
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,200
Miss Sunshine's eyes are cold as she stands in 
the door of the classroom. A paper aeroplane  

147
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,240
flies through the air and lands at her feet. 
Dexter pulls a small boy's arm behind his back.  

148
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,160
Two other boys are fighting. Girls 
are shouting. There's so much noise.

149
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,960
Miss Sunshine walks to the teacher's desk, but 
the noise doesn't stop. She takes a whistle from  

150
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,840
her bag and blows it. The sound makes the 
whole class stop and look at their teacher.

151
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:23,600
'Good morning,' Miss Sunshine says. She waits 
for the class to stand. Some of the boys sit  

152
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,160
in their chairs. They are writing texts on their 
phones or listening to music. Blaze is humming.

153
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,040
'I see,' says Miss Sunshine. She speaks 
only to the children who are standing.  

154
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,480
'Can you bring your chairs round the piano?'

155
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,160
I take my chair and sit next to Emma.  

156
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,720
She's a sweet girl who works hard. She's clever 
and they laugh at her because she wears glasses.

157
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,720
I don't know what Miss Sunshine 
will do about the other children.

158
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,120
She takes some paper from her bag 
and gives a sheet of paper to Dexter,  

159
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,400
Ajax, Blaze, Roxy and Iris.

160
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
'I would like you to write me a few paragraphs  

161
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,920
on The Music I Like,' she says. She 
walks away. They don't say anything.

162
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,640
She looks at us and says 'Take a deep breath.'

163
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Someone laughs, but Miss Sunshine closes 
her eyes for a moment. 'Stand up.'

164
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
We all stand.

165
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
'Shoulders down, stand tall, straight backs.'

166
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,240
We sing some scales. Our music 
lessons are a lot of fun.  

167
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
Our old teacher didn't let 
us sing in music lessons.

168
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,760
There are some things in this world that are 
amazing. I love singing to a real piano. Miss  

169
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Sunshine plays really well and then she gives 
us the music to Imagine by John Lennon. We  

170
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,080
don't look at the words. We know them. We 
put the music down and sing from memory.

171
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,160
Miss Sunshine asks if anyone would like 
to sing a solo. The girls whisper 'Emma'.  

172
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,080
Shy little Emma, who is clever and 
wears glasses, has a wonderful voice.

173
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:24,240
And it's strange because now Dexter, 
Ajax, Blaze, Roxy and Iris are alone.

174
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
They are miserable and we 
are smiling and having fun.

175
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,560
At the end of the lesson Miss Sunshine 
collects the sheets of blank paper.  

176
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,040
She tells them to stay behind.

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,520
'I want to speak to each of you,' she says.

178
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,600
'But we'll miss the school bus home,' 
says Iris. 'My mum will be angry.'

179
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,160
'The driver will return and take you home later. 
I'll phone your parents and explain everything.'

180
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Roxy gives Iris a killer look and 
they become even more miserable.

181
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,240
For the first time, I run laughing out of school 
with Emma. We are smiling and singing Imagine.
 
 
 

182
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
CHAPTER FIVE

183
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,880
Feeling Good

184
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,320
The next morning we go into the music room.  

185
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,760
I don't know what Miss Sunshine said 
to Dexter and the others yesterday,  

186
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,920
but the mood is better. There is more respect. 
Roxy and Ajax are sitting quietly. They aren't  

187
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:41,360
sending text messages. Blaze isn't humming. 
Dexter isn't rocking on two legs of his chair.

188
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,520
I hope we are going to sing round the piano, but 
Miss Sunshine takes an unusual object from her  

189
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:58,560
bag. 'This is a singing bowl,' she says. 'When I 
run this wooden stick around the bowl, it makes  

190
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:08,800
a sound like a bell. This bowl is very old. Listen 
carefully until you can't hear the sound anymore.'

191
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,800
The singing bowl makes a mysterious 
sound. It sings in my head.  

192
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
About a minute passes. There is 
complete silence in the classroom.

193
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,120
'What can you hear?' Miss Sunshine whispers.

194
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,160
'Nothing at all, Miss,' says Emma.

195
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,360
'Remember that there is silence in music too and 
moments of silence are important in our lives.  

196
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,560
Sound and music can help and mindfulness helps 
your brain to work better. Let's make a brain.'

197
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,320
What! We look at each other.

198
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
'Put one hand in the air,' says Miss Sunshine.  

199
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,760
'Now put your thumb across and curl your 
fingers over the top - this is the brain.'

200
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,560
'Cool,' says Ajax.

201
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,080
'The mind is complex. It talks. Sometimes 
there's a lot of stress in our heads.'

202
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
'My brain is always talking to me,' says Ajax.

203
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,600
'That's fine, everyone's brain talks,' says 
Miss Sunshine. 'We can help our brain relax  

204
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,480
when we are kind to other 
people. It makes us feel good.'

205
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,880
'Singing makes me feel good. Can 
we sing again, Miss?' asks Ruby.

206
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,240
'Of course we can. Bring your 
chairs closer to the piano.'

207
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,040
Miss Sunshine gets us to sing some scales.

208
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,720
Miss Sunshine asks Roxy to play the piano.  

209
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Roxy looks shy at first and says she's too 
embarrassed to play in front of everyone.

210
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,520
When Miss Sunshine says that 
Roxy can play some jazz,  

211
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:03,680
she jumps up. Roxy has got great rhythm. She's 
really good. I didn't know she had this talent.

212
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,040
We sing a song my mum likes, 
You've got a Friend by Carole King.  

213
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,040
I like the words of this song and singing 
together makes us feel more united as a class.

214
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,000
Singing and mindfulness are helping. My 
brain feels better by the end of class.  

215
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm less stressed and more relaxed. When the 
bell rings, we skip to our next lesson.
 
 
 

216
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
CHAPTER SIX

217
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,960
Fire!

218
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,240
Dexter and I sit near each 
other every day on the bus.  

219
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,200
We get on and off at the same 
stop but he doesn't walk with me.  

220
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:53,360
He walks far behind me. He kicks stones along the 
road. I hurry ahead because I want to get home.

221
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,000
I know where Dexter lives. 
I pass his house every day,  

222
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,880
but this afternoon as I look 
across his front garden, I stop.

223
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:12,160
'Dexter,' I shout. 'Quick. Hurry! There's 
a fire!' My voice is high. I am afraid.

224
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,040
He starts to run. Together we 
run towards the smoke and flames.

225
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,080
'Who's in there?' I say.

226
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,560
'Mum and my little sister. She's only three.'

227
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,200
I pull my phone out of my pocket and dial 999. I 
shout 'fire' when they ask me what service I need.  

228
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,840
I try to breathe slowly and calm myself down. My 
voice is shaking when I give them the address.

229
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,560
Dexter opens the front door and 
there's lots of black smoke.

230
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
'I'm going in,' he says.

231
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:53,920
'Wait!' I run to an outside tap and hold my 
scarf under the water. I run back and tie the  

232
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:01,520
scarf around Dexter's nose and mouth. I pull my 
jacket up over my mouth. 'I'm coming with you.'

233
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,440
He pushes me back. 'No, you're 
not. It's too dangerous.  

234
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,760
I know where mum and my sister will be.'

235
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,240
Then he goes inside and all 
I can do is cry and wait.

236
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,680
One minute, two minutes pass. It seems 
longer. The fire brigade arrives,  

237
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,560
then two ambulances. Dexter 
appears through the smoke.  

238
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,680
He is carrying his sister. His hands are 
burned, but he wants to go back for his mother.

239
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,320
'Leave it to us,' says a fireman. Firemen 
pull Dexter away from the burning house.  

240
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,320
He doesn't want to leave. They lift 
Dexter and his sister into the ambulance  

241
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,160
and put on the emergency 
blue light. That scares me.

242
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,280
A fireman appears carrying a woman. And 
at that moment there's an explosion.

243
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,480
'Move away from here. It isn't 
safe.' A fireman says to me.  

244
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,560
I can smell fire on my clothes and in my hair. 
There's nothing for me to do. I walk home.

245
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,400
Dexter is away from school for ten days and 
when he returns he has bandages on his hands.  

246
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,120
Everyone is pleased to see 
him, especially Miss Sunshine.

247
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,520
'How is your mother and your 
little sister?' she asks.

248
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,400
Dexter smiles. 'They're doing well.  

249
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,120
The doctors are great. They are still 
in hospital but they will be home soon.'

250
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,840
'So, you are living with your grandma.'

251
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,320
Dexter smiles again.  

252
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,760
'Yeah, she's lovely. We'll be there for a 
while until the builders repair our house.'

253
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,240
'You were very brave, Dexter,' Miss Sunshine says.

254
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,320
Dexter looks at his shoes. 'Not really. 
I was scared when I went into the house.  

255
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,800
I couldn't see anything and 
it was really hot in there.'

256
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,440
'Do the police know what started 
the fire?' Miss Sunshine asks.

257
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,560
'They don't know.' Dexter looks around the 
classroom for me. 'Alice was there. She gave  

258
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:19,520
me her scarf to put over my mouth. It's the smoke 
that kills. You saved my life. Thanks, Alice.'

259
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,920
And our class cheer and I'm crying. Dexter 
is looking down and trying not to cry.

260
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,360
'I have something, for both of you.' Miss 
Sunshine gives Dexter a large package  

261
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:39,360
and a smaller one to me. Dexter's is a violin... 
a really good one. I can see he's pleased.

262
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,640
'It's awesome!' he says. 'I love it.'

263
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
'I don't play the violin 
anymore. I want you to play it.'

264
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,360
Miss Sunshine turns to the class. 'I 
don't think you know that Dexter is  

265
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,640
very talented. He plays jazz violin very well.'

266
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
She looks at Dexter.  

267
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,800
'You can't play at the moment. Will you 
play for us when your hands are better?'

268
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Dexter smiles. 'Of course.'

269
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,240
In my package there is a ukulele.

270
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,560
'For the ukulele band we're starting,' 
Miss Sunshine says. 'It's easy to learn  

271
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,960
and I want the band to play 
in the school musical.'

272
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,600
'A musical!' everyone says 
together. We all smile.
 
 
 

273
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,880
CHAPTER SEVEN

274
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,120
Everyone Has a Talent

275
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,840
My world is different and everything is better.  

276
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:51,120
We all talk about the musical. We don't walk 
to classes, we dance along the corridors. Ajax,  

277
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,000
who's good with words, is writing the story and 
we practice the songs every day. Our voices are  

278
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,120
better, stronger with Miss Sunshine teaching 
us. Mr Weak hums when he passes the music room.

279
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,560
'Everyone has a talent. You just have to find 
it,' Miss Sunshine says during our lesson.

280
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,400
She's right. There are so many people 
in our class who have a special talent.  

281
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:27,280
Iris Fudge is a brilliant dancer. We didn't 
know. I love watching her when she's dancing.  

282
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,120
She becomes someone else, so 
beautiful and full of life.  

283
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,840
She's practising after school every 
day with some girls who study ballet.

284
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,280
People who are good at art 
are painting the scenery.

285
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,840
And me? I'm singing in the chorus and 
learning the ukulele in my free time.  

286
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,840
I follow lessons online and 
I practise in my bedroom.

287
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Dexter is responsible for the orchestra and 
their rehearsals. He's very musical. He has  

288
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,840
a great feel for rhythm. And he's changed! He's 
kind to people and that can make you feel good.

289
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:14,080
And the funny thing is that Dexter is different 
physically too. His eyes are not small and hard.  

290
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,920
They are soft. He looks taller, more responsible. 
He smiles a lot. Dexter is someone I can trust.

291
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,680
He's playing the violin again 
now that his hands are better.  

292
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,800
The sound he makes is beautiful. 
When he plays I feel happy.

293
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,600
We travel home together on the bus and he 
talks about the music and performers he loves.  

294
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,000
He wants to go to Music College 
in London when he finishes school.

295
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,920
'How often do you practise?' I ask him.

296
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,720
'Every day. An hour before school and 
a couple of hours when I get home.'

297
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
'Wow!' I say.

298
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,240
'If I work really hard, I'll pass the audition.'

299
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,400
'And then what?' I ask.

300
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,240
'A career in music, I think,' he says. 'I can 
play in an orchestra or form my own jazz group.  

301
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
What do you want to do, Alice?'

302
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
'I want to be a doctor,' I say in a small voice.

303
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,760
We sit in silence for a minute and I 
start to panic. I'm expecting him to laugh  

304
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,200
and return to the old Dexter. But he smiles.

305
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,760
'You'll do it, Alice. It won't be easy and you'll 
have to work hard, but I know you'll do it.'

306
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,440
And I'm not sure why, but I feel strange.
 
 
 

307
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,040
CHAPTER EIGHT

308
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,240
The Talent Scout

309
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,320
There is no bullying anymore and there 
is more respect for the teachers.  

310
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,800
The school magazine is all about the musical 
- interviews with the cast and with Ajax.  

311
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,400
The story is about people who are 
different. We can't all be the same.  

312
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,080
The message is to be kind to someone every day. 
Most of all it is about the power of friendship.

313
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,560
Tickets are sold out for all five performances 
and we are all excited. I'm playing the ukulele  

314
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,000
in one song and I'm singing in the 
chorus. The songs make us happy.  

315
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,840
We are full of confidence. 
School has a greater purpose.

316
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,760
'This is your musical,' Miss Sunshine 
says. 'Smile and enjoy the evening.'

317
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,880
We are nervous as we wait. It's five minutes 
before the musical starts and I look round the  

318
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,440
curtain at the audience. The concert hall is full. 
Why have all those parents brought video cameras?

319
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,880
The music starts. This is it. We step 
into another world of lights and costumes.  

320
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,840
And little shy Emma sings beautifully on 
stage. It's a new and exciting experience.  

321
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,320
A live performance is very different. We can 
hear the audience laugh and clap. It's great  

322
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,560
to see their reaction. Their eyes are wide, their 
faces are smiling, they are enjoying every moment.  

323
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,400
I can see my parents surprise when 
the chorus sings. We are fantastic.

324
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,160
We sing and dance for five 
nights. On the first night  

325
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,720
Mr Weak gives flowers to Miss Sunshine and the 
other teachers. We have a party. We are happy!

326
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
One morning Miss Sunshine 
comes into the music room.  

327
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,400
She has something to tell us. She closes her eyes 
until there's silence, then opens them again.

328
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,360
'An American talent scout came 
to one of your performances.'

329
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,800
She can see we don't understand what a talent 
scout is. She tries again. 'A talent scout  

330
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,200
is someone who recognises 
great talent and promotes it.'

331
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,280
'Oooooh,' we all say.

332
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,560
'His name is Addison Bell. He's a friend of 
mine and he came to talk to me at the end of the  

333
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:18,240
musical. He's American, from Los Angeles. He wants 
to take your musical to Hollywood this summer!

334
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,600
Silence. Then there are cheers 
and laughter and crying.

335
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,240
'He thinks there's great talent 
in this show and he wants  

336
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,000
American children to hear your message 
of friendship,' Miss Sunshine says.

337
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,960
The summer holidays arrive and we fly to 
Hollywood. Limousines pick us up at the airport.  

338
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,280
I feel like a celebrity when I walk the red 
carpet entrance to the Beverly Hills Hotel.  

339
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,880
It's great. There's a pool surrounded 
by palm trees in tropical gardens.  

340
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,840
Dexter is happy because musicians play jazz 
in the restaurant. There isn't much free time,  

341
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,440
but when we do have a moment we watch 
people and Lamborghinis in the city centre.  

342
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,760
Rehearsals are going well and 
we will perform in a theatre.

343
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,280
It's our first night tomorrow and we are all 
excited. I don't want this to end. I don't  

344
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,880
want to come back down to earth. But with Miss 
Sunshine in our lives, what will happen next?

345
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,120
And I suppose you think this is 
the end of my story, but not quite.

346
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,800
Music is a powerful force and 
I love Dexter's violin playing.  

347
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
We spend a lot of time 
together. We watch the sunsets,  

348
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:51,120
we laugh and talk. When his hand touches mine 
and our fingers meet, we don't let go.
 
 
 
 

349
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,720
- THE END -
