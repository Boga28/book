CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:20,070
Two Tickets
Gabriel had a kind face and intelligent brown

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,360
eyes.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,699
He usually had a friendly smile.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,769
But there was no smile on his face today.

6
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,849
He wasn't happy.

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,030
'I'd like to be as rich as Marco,' he thought.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,039
'But I'm only good old Gabriel.

9
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,670
Silvia likes me.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,899
I know she does.

11
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,600
She thinks I'm kind and nice.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,270
But she thinks I'm boring, too.

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,000
Boring old Gabriel, that's me.'

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,129
Gabriel had two tickets for a film.

15
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,899
There was a red rose on the table in his sitting-room.

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,030
He took the rose and the tickets and went
out.

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,950
An hour later, Gabriel arrived at the door
of Silvia's flat.

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,960
When she opened the door, she didn't smile
at him.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,350
'Oh, hello,' she said.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,290
'What... er...?'

21
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,119
'Don't you remember, Silvia?' said Gabriel.

22
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,119
'It's Sunday evening.

23
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,180
We're going to the cinema.

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,380
I've got the tickets.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,310
It's that great new film.

26
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,590
You said...'

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,110
'What do you mean?' said Silvia.

28
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,390
'I can't go out with you this evening.

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,390
I'm busy.

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,560
1 don't remember

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,329
'But I called you on Thursday!'

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,329
Gabriel said.

33
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,649
'You wanted to come!'

34
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,469
Silvia pushed her beautiful dark hair out
of her eyes.

35
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,899
She didn't look at Gabriel.

36
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,219
'Oh dear,' she said.

37
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,030
'That was stupid of me.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm really sorry.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,250
Please don't be angry, Gabriel.

40
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,820
Come back tomorrow.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,340
We'll go to the film tomorrow.'

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,430
She began to shut the door.

43
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,860
'Silvia,' Gabriel said angrily, 'you're going
out with Marco!

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,150
I know you are!

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,020
I want to tell you something about Marco.

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,980
He's rich, but he's a bad man.

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,110
You're being stupid, Silvia.'

48
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,110
He stopped.

49
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
Silvia wasn't there.

50
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,110
'I'm talking to the door,' he thought angrily.

51
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,110
He looked at the rose in his hand.

52
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,110
Then he threw it onto the ground.

53
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,110
Behind him, he heard a quiet laugh.

54
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,110
He turned.

55
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,110
There was a man on the stairs.

56
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,110
His clothes were expensive, and there were
twenty red roses in his hand.

57
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,110
It was Marco.

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,110
'Oh dear, Gabriel,' Marco laughed.

59
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,110
'Is she busy tonight?

60
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,110
Doesn't she want to go out with you?

61
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,110
I'll try now.

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Perhaps she'll go out with me'

63
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,110
Gabriel didn't answer.

64
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,110
He walked quickly away and went down to the
street.

65
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,110
It was a hot Sunday evening.

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,110
There was no wind.

67
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,110
A lot of people were in the street.

68
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,110
They sat in the parks and drank in the cafes.

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,110
Young men and women talked and laughed.

70
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,110
Gabriel didn't want to look at them.

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,110
He felt too unhappy.

72
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,110
He took out the two tickets.

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
'I paid for them,' he thought, 'and it's a
wonderful film.

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,110
I'll go without her!

75
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,110
I'm not going to think about Silvia Delgado.

76
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,110
I'll go and see the film, and I'll enjoy it.'

77
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,110
The Plaza cinema was a big, old building in
the centre of town.

78
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,110
The doors weren't open, so there were a lot
of people outside.

79
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,110
Gabriel waited with them.

80
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,110
When the doors opened, people went quickly
inside to the ticket office.

81
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,110
But Gabriel had his ticket, so he waited outside.

82
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,110
It was 8.27 p.m.

83
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,110
And at that minute, the earthquake happened.

84
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,110
CHAPTER TWO
A Table for Two

85
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,110
Marco stood at the door of Silvia's flat and
watched Gabriel leaving.

86
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,110
He looked carefully at his clothes and his
shoes.

87
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,110
Why didn't Silvia open the door?

88
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,110
She was in there.

89
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,590
Then, suddenly, it opened.

90
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,500
'Silvia dear,' Marco said, 'you look wonderful...'

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,040
He stopped.

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,799
Silvia didn't look wonderful.

93
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,470
Her face was red, and she looked unhappy.

94
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,250
'Gabriel said something to her,' Marco thought.

95
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,080
'What was it?

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,950
That young man doesn't like me, and I don't
like him.'

97
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,530
He followed Silvia into the sitting-room.

98
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,159
'I'm nearly ready,' she said.

99
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,959
'Have a drink.

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,160
I'll come in a minute.'

101
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,959
Marco knew the Delgado's sitting-room well.

102
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,930
He went to the table, and got a drink.

103
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,670
Then he sat down in an expensive armchair.

104
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,820
He liked the flat.

105
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:24,770
There were beautiful pictures on the walls,
and everything in the room looked very expensive.

106
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,300
Silvia lived with her mother.

107
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,510
Her father was dead.

108
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,000
Before he died, Mr Delgado had a good job.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,530
He had cars and friends and a lot of money.

110
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:46,320
But the Delgado's weren't a rich family now,
and Silvia's mother was ill.

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,270
The doctor often came and visited her.

112
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,670
Sometimes, Mrs Delgado had to go to hospital.

113
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,350
She had to have good food and expensive medicines.

114
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,100
The Delgado's didn't have much money now.

115
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,800
Marco didn't know about the Delgado's money.

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,920
He saw their pictures, their jewellery and
other expensive things, and he liked them

117
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
all.

118
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
'Silvia!'

119
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,580
Mrs Delgado called weakly from her bedroom.

120
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,090
'Are you there, dear?

121
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,610
What are you doing?

122
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,120
Is somebody with you?

123
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,010
Who is it?'

124
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,520
Marco heard Silvia's answer.

125
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,290
It's all right, mother,' she said.

126
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,180
'It's only Gabriel.

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,840
We're going to see a film.'

128
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,930
'Ah!'

129
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,100
thought Marco.

130
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,640
'So Mrs Delgado doesn't like me!

131
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,090
Mrs Delgado likes dear Gabriel!'

132
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:10,570
He went back to 
the table and had another drink.

133
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,530
'Perhaps you don't like me, Mrs Delgado,'
Marco thought.

134
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,280
'But your daughter does.

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Oh, yes.

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
She likes me very much.'

137
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
He smiled.

138
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,390
Ten minutes later, Silvia came into the room
again.

139
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,410
Her dark hair was beautiful.

140
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,580
Her big, brown eyes were excited.

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,180
Her dress was very pretty.

142
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
She smiled happily.

143
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,920
'Hello, Marco,' she said.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,730
'I'm ready now.'

145
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,230
He put down his glass and stood up.

146
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:52,800
'We're going to have a wonderful, wonderful
evening,' he said.

147
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,740
Outside, it was very hot.

148
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,240
Marco drove his car fast.

149
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,000
Silvia felt the wind in her hair.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,380
It was good.

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,140
'Gabriel hasn't got a car,' thought Silvia.

152
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,620
She turned and looked at Marco.

153
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,690
'Where are we going?'

154
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,720
she asked.

155
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:26,010
'I'm taking you to the Oasis Restaurant,'
Marco said.

156
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,090
'It's the best restaurant in town.

157
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:40,210
It's very expensive, of course, but nothing
is too good for you, Silvia.

158
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,600
I know a lot of girls, but you're the most
beautiful.'

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,650
The Oasis Restaurant was two kilometres outside
the town.

160
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,700
There were a lot of big cars outside it.

161
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,820
Marco pushed open the doors.

162
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,280
Inside, it was nearly dark.

163
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,460
There were pretty little lights on the tables,
and a man played quiet music.

164
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Some people danced.

165
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,020
'Good evening, sir,' the manager said to Marco.

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,200
'I called this afternoon,' said Marco.

167
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,390
'I want a table for two.'

168
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,450
'Of course.

169
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,590
Please follow me,' the manager said.

170
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,400
Marco and Silvia followed him to the back
of the restaurant.

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,510
Their table was near the door to the kitchen.

172
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,260
Waiters went in and out with food and drink.

173
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,100
Marco looked at the manager angrily.

174
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,910
'I don't want this table,' he said.

175
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,300
'We're going to dance later.

176
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,630
We want to be near the dancing.

177
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,460
I have to have a better table.'

178
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,920
'I'm sorry, sir,' said the manager.'

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,120
I can't do that.

180
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320
We're busy this evening.

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,520
Come early next time.

182
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,650
Then I can put you near the dancing.'

183
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,420
He began to walk away.

184
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,870
'Wait a minute,' said Marco.

185
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,330
'I'm not happy with this.

186
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,400
You've got to...'

187
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,480
'I'm very sorry,' said the manager again.

188
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,760
'I can't give you a better table now.

189
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,810
Later, perhaps...'

190
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,370
'But...' said Marco.

191
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,070
People began to turn round and look at Marco.

192
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,840
Silvia looked at the floor.

193
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,140
Marco always did this.

194
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:04,160
He always wanted the best place in the restaurant,
in the theatre or at the football game.

195
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,490
Silvia put her hand on Marco's arm.

196
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,060
'This table's OK,' she said.

197
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,650
'I don't want to change.

198
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,650
Why...?'

199
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,170
'Be quiet, my dear,' said Marco.

200
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,750
'Leave this to me.'

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,950
He turned back to the manager.

202
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,040
'Now,' he said, 'you listen to me.'

203
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,910
'Everybody's watching us now,' thought Silvia.

204
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,020
She caught his arm again.

205
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,230
'I'll see you in a minute,' she said.

206
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,570
'I'm going to the washroom.'

207
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,360
She walked between the tables to a door at
the other end of the restaurant.

208
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,110
She saw young men and women dancing.

209
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,370
Older people laughed and talked.

210
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,650
They all looked happy.

211
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,330
The washroom was outside the restaurant, in
a small garden.

212
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:51,010
Silvia opened the door and walked into the
garden.

213
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,710
It was 8.27 p.m.

214
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,590
And at that minute, the earthquake happened.

215
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,410
CHAPTER THREE
Silvia's Story

216
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,130
The ground moved under Silvia's feet.

217
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,130
'Help!

218
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,940
What is it?

219
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,850
What's happening?'

220
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,750
she thought.

221
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,320
There was a terrible noise, and she looked
up into the sky.

222
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,630
Perhaps the noise and the shaking came from
a plane.

223
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,710
Suddenly, the lights went out, and it was
nearly dark.

224
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,820
Then people started to scream.

225
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,680
Silvia didn't move.

226
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,550
She couldn't move.

227
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,660
'It's an earthquake,' she thought.

228
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,150
'Oh, no, please, no!'

229
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,640
The ground moved again.

230
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:54,500
A long crack started to run up from the bottom
of the wall in front of her to the top.

231
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,779
Then the wall opened, and Silvia could see
the people inside the restaurant.

232
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:00,150
They tried to run.

233
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,460
Their screams were terrible.

234
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,010
She could see hands pushing and pulling.

235
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,290
She could see their faces and their eyes.

236
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,930
They were terribly afraid.

237
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,200
Then the wall fell, and the roof came down.

238
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,730
Silvia couldn't see the faces and hands now.

239
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,260
The Oasis Restaurant wasn't there.

240
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,170
It was only rubble.

241
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,480
Silvia couldn't move.

242
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,980
She couldn't scream.

243
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,230
'Marco's in there!'

244
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,230
she thought.

245
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,500
'Marco, and the manager, and... and those
people.

246
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
They...

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, I can't...

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
I don't...'

249
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
There was another loud noise behind her.

250
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Silvia turned.

251
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Another building fell.

252
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
And another.

253
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
And another.

254
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Suddenly, she remembered her mother.

255
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Silvia tried to get out of the garden into
the street, but it wasn't easy.

256
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,210
She had to climb over a broken wall.

257
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,029
She couldn't climb in her evening shoes.

258
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,279
She took them off and carried them in her
hand.

259
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,770
She got up to the top of the wall and fell
down into the street.

260
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,070
Her pretty dress was dirty now, and she had
cuts on her feet.

261
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,260
There were people everywhere.

262
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,170
They ran up and down the street and screamed.

263
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,620
Some people tried to pull the rubble away
from a building.

264
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,440
'Come and help!'

265
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,850
one of them said to Silvia.

266
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,990
'My little boy's under there.

267
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,270
Help me, please!'

268
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,770
'I'm sorry,' said Silvia.

269
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,610
'I have to find my mother.'

270
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,810
There were cars everywhere, too.

271
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,640
Everybody wanted to get away from the buildings
and out into the country.

272
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
'Stop!

273
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Take me with you!

274
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,830
Take me home!'

275
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,420
she screamed at them.

276
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,410
But they didn't hear her.

277
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,600
They didn't stop.

278
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,060
'I'll have to walk,' she thought.

279
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:04,050
It's a long way, but I can do it.

280
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,730
I have to go home and help my mother.

281
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,240
I have to!'

282
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,390
Silvia began to run.

283
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,810
It wasn't easy.

284
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,320
There was rubble across the road.

285
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,090
A roof fell to the ground behind her.

286
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,570
A wall suddenly fell in front of her.

287
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,410
She climbed over it, and started to run again.

288
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,120
It wasn't dark now.

289
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:42,230
The sky was red and black with fires and thick,
black smoke, Silvia had only one idea in her

290
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,230
head.

291
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,810
There was nobody with her mother.

292
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,670
She was ill in her bed.

293
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,790
She couldn't move easily.

294
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,220
Perhaps she was hurt.

295
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,390
Perhaps she was...

296
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,390
'No!'

297
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,570
thought Silvia.

298
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,740
'She's not dead!

299
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,640
Oh, please, no, please!

300
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
She's all right.

301
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,290
I know she is!

302
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,290
Mother!

303
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,290
Mother!'

304
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,670
She was in the centre of town now.

305
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,390
She looked round the square.

306
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,790
There were some houses, and the big church
clock showed the right time.

307
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,080
But the hotel next to it was only a ruin.

308
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,970
The Plaza was in the same square.

309
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,140
For the first time, Silvia stopped and watched.

310
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,210
Firemen and policemen carried people out of
the cinema.

311
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,210
'What happened?'

312
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,029
she asked a girl.

313
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,029
'The roof fell,' the girl said.

314
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,020
'Hundreds of people are dead.'

315
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,610
'Perhaps Gabriel didn't go,' thought Silvia.

316
00:15:51,610 --> 00:16:00,500
'Or perhaps he came too late, or ...' She
didn't want to think about Gabriel now.

317
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,480
The idea was too terrible.

318
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:14,620
The Delgado's building was near the town centre,
at the end of a street.

319
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,500
Silvia began to run again.

320
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,960
She could see a big fire.

321
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,620
She could hear people screaming.

322
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,590
The building next to the Delgado's home was
a ruin.

323
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,210
Men and women pulled at the rubble.

324
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,250
Silvia knew them.

325
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,640
They were her neighbors.

326
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
They wanted to find their families and friends.

327
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,800
But the Delgado's building was there.

328
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,750
There was a big crack in the front wall, and
some windows were broken.

329
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,010
But the building looked safe.

330
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,270
'Hey, don't go in there!'

331
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,900
a man called to Silvia.

332
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,120
'It's too dangerous!'

333
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,740
But Silvia didn't stop.

334
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:03,090
She pushed open the door and went in Inside,
it was dark.

335
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,670
She tried the lights, but they didn't work.

336
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,380
Quickly, she ran up the stairs to the flat.

337
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,959
The front door was open.

338
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,959
'Mother!'

339
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,959
she called.

340
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,959
'Are you all right?

341
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,959
It's me!

342
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:20,959
Mother, where are you?'

343
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,290
She went to her mother's bedroom.

344
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,740
The door was open, but there was nobody in
the bed.

345
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,030
Mrs Delgado wasn't there.

346
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,030
CHAPTER FOUR
Neighbours

347
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,440
Silvia sat down on her mother's bed and cried.

348
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
'Where is she?'

349
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
she thought.

350
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
'Who's with her?

351
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
What can I do?'

352
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
She stood up.

353
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Her feet hurt, so she went to her bedroom
for some better shoes.

354
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,000
She started to take off her dress, but then
she heard another loud noise.

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Another building fell.

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,743
'I can't stay here inside the building,' she
thought.

357
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:43,743
'It's too dangerous.'

358
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,710
She went quickly out of the flat and down
into the street.

359
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,850
Then she stopped.

360
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,360
'Where can I go?

361
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,880
What can I do?'

362
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
she thought.

363
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,290
First, she had to find her mother.

364
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,929
After that - but no, she didn't want to think
about Marco.

365
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,059
He was in the ruins of the Oasis Restaurant.

366
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,070
And she couldn't think about Gabriel.

367
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,570
Perhaps he was in the ruins of the Plaza cinema.

368
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,570
Suddenly, she saw a neighbour.

369
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,570
The old man lived in the next building.

370
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,360
She went to him and put her hand on his arm.

371
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
'Oh, Mr Enrique's,' she said.

372
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
'You're safe.'

373
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
The old man didn't move.

374
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
He didn't see or hear her.

375
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
His face was white and his hands shook.

376
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
He started to cry quietly.

377
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Silvia shook his arm.

378
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
'Mr Enrique's!'

379
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
she said.

380
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
'It's me, Silvia Delgado.

381
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Where's my mother?

382
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
She's not in our flat.

383
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
You know she can't walk.

384
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Did somebody take her?

385
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Who?

386
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Where did they go?'

387
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
The old man turned and looked at her.

388
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
'Silvia - Mrs Delgado - I don't know,' he
said.

389
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
'I can't remember.

390
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
There was something - yes, I think...

391
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
perhaps it was Mr Garcia.

392
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Yes, Mr Garcia, the man from the second floor
in your building.

393
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
He carried her down and put her in his car.

394
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Yes, that's it.

395
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
It was Mr Garcia.'

396
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
'But where are they?' said Silvia.

397
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
'Where did they go?'

398
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
'He said something,' said the old man.

399
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
'I don't remember.

400
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
He said, 'Tell Silvia...'

401
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
'Tell me what?

402
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Please remember, Mr Enrique's.

403
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Please!'

404
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
'He said... er... something about a park,'
said Mr Enrique's.

405
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
'Yes, that was it.

406
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
"It's safe in the park," he said.

407
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
He wanted to go away from the buildings.

408
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Past the river.

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
To Liberty Park.'

410
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Silvia looked at Mr. Enrique's sad, old face
and put her arm round him.

411
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
'Thank you, oh, thank you,' she said.

412
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
'I'll come back later.

413
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
I'll help you then.'

414
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
'Help me?

415
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
You can't help me,' said Mr Enrique's.

416
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
'I haven't got anything now.

417
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
My wife, my home...'

418
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Liberty Park was outside the town, past the
football ground.

419
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,490
Silvia started to walk.

420
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,490
Then she stopped.

421
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,490
Her mother was old and ill.

422
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,850
She had to take her medicines.

423
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,150
And they were on the table next to her mother's
bed.

424
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,090
It was dangerous, but Silvia didn't think
about it.

425
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,290
She ran back into the flat.

426
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,830
She found a big bag and put into it some warm
clothes and her mother's medicine bottles.

427
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,760
Then she ran outside again and shut the door
behind her.

428
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,320
It was a long way to Liberty Park.

429
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,260
Silvia started walking.

430
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,680
CHAPTER FIVE
Gabriel's Story

431
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,970
At the time of the earthquake, Gabriel was
outside the Plaza.

432
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:36,550
A lot of people wanted to buy their tickets,
and they went inside.

433
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,530
But he had his ticket.

434
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:42,310
He was safe because he waited outside.

435
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,230
Gabriel heard the first sounds of the earthquake.

436
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,510
But he didn't see the buildings when they
fell.

437
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,890
He didn't hear the screams.

438
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,790
Some rubble hit him on the head and he fell
to the ground.

439
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,770
Alter a long time, he heard somebody.

440
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,890
It was a woman.

441
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,640
'Look at this young man,' the woman said.

442
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
'Is he dead?'

443
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
'No,' said another woman, 'but he's hurt.'

444
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
'I'm - I'm all right,' said Gabriel.

445
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
He tried to sit up.

446
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
The women moved away.

447
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Gabriel's arm hurt terribly.

448
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
He couldn't move it.

449
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
It was broken.

450
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
He sat in the street.

451
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Then he stood up slowly, and looked round.

452
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
It was nearly dark.

453
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Only the cars gave some light.

454
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
'My family!' he thought.

455
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
'Mum!

456
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Dad!'

457
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
But they were a long way away in another town.

458
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
He couldn't do anything for them.

459
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Then he thought of Silvia.

460
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
She was with Marco.

461
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
He couldn't help her.

462
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
But there was nobody with Mrs Delgado.

463
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
And she was ill.

464
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
'I'll go back to the Delgado's flat,' thought
Gabriel.

465
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
'I can help Mrs Delgado, and perhaps I'll
hear news of Silvia.'

466
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Slowly, he started to walk.

467
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
He felt terribly weak.

468
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
His right arm hurt very badly, and his head,
too.

469
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Sometimes he nearly fell.

470
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Hundreds of people were in the street.

471
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
A woman ran into Gabriel.

472
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
By accident, she hit his arm.

473
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
It hurt terribly.

474
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
He sat down in the road.

475
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Everything went black.

476
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
When Gabriel opened his eyes again, he felt
very ill.

477
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
He tried to sit up and look round.

478
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
He wasn't in the street now.

479
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
He was on the ground with a lot of other people.

480
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Doctors and nurses moved quietly round them.

481
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
He tried to feel his head with his hand.

482
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Then he remembered his arm.

483
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
A nurse came to him.

484
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
'Where am I?

485
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
What happened?' he said.

486
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
'You're in the garden of the hospital,' she
said.

487
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
'Your arm's broken, I'm afraid.

488
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
And you've got a bad cut on your head, too.

489
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
We can't do more for you now.

490
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Thousands of people are waiting for help,
and we haven't got medicines for all of them.

491
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
It's not safe inside the hospital, but don't
worry.

492
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
You'll be all right here.

493
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Stay here quietly and sleep.'

494
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
She went away.

495
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Gabriel watched her.

496
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Then he remembered Silvia.

497
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
He had to go and find her.

498
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
He had to help Mrs Delgado.

499
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Slowly, he stood up.

500
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
He was weak, but he could walk.

501
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
The doctors and nurses didn't see him.

502
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
They were too busy.

503
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Gabriel left the hospital and started to walk
back into town.

504
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
CHAPTER SIX
Liberty Park

505
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Silvia didn't like walking.

506
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
She usually caught a bus or took a taxi.

507
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
She was tired, and her back hurt.

508
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
But she didn't think about her back, or about
the cuts on her feet.

509
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
She was with a lot of other people.

510
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
They all had the same idea.

511
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
They wanted to leave the town and go into
the country, away from the dangerous high

512
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
buildings.

513
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
A friendly woman talked to Silvia.

514
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
'Isn't anybody with you, dear?'

515
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
she said.

516
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
'Where's your family?'

517
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
'There's only my mother,' said Silvia.

518
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
'I think she's at Liberty Park.

519
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm going to look for her.'

520
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
'Don't worry, you'll find her,' the woman
said kindly.

521
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Silvia felt better.

522
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
'Did you see the Grand Hotel?' said a man.

523
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
'It's a ruin.

524
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,309
Hundreds of people were inside it.'

525
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,150
'It's terrible, terrible,' his wife said.

526
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,150
'I saw a baby...'

527
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,150
She stopped.

528
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,150
'And the shopping centre,' another woman said.

529
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,150
'The shoe shop is all right, but the supermarket
is a ruin.'

530
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,150
'The center's bad,' said a man, 'but it's
worse east of here.

531
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,150
I was out there when the earthquake happened.'

532
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,150
'Near the station?'

533
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,150
the kind woman asked.

534
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,150
'No, near the Oasis Restaurant,' the man said.

535
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,150
Silvia started to listen more carefully.

536
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,150
'The Oasis is a lovely place,' somebody said.

537
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,150
'Is it all right?'

538
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,150
'No,' the man said.

539
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,150
'It's a ruin.

540
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,150
A lot of people are dead.

541
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,150
But the manager was all right.

542
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,150
He was at the back of the restaurant.

543
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,150
It was better there.

544
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,150
He'll be all right.

545
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,150
I wanted to help the other people, but I was
worried about my family.

546
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,150
So I came back into town.

547
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,150
We're all safe.

548
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,150
But our home...'

549
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,150
He stopped talking.

550
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,150
Silvia turned to him.

551
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,150
'Excuse me,' she said.

552
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
'There was a man in the restaurant - the manager
was with him when - when... the earthquake...

553
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,150
Do you know - is he all right?'

554
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,150
'Yes,' said the man.

555
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,150
'He's all right.

556
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,150
I pulled him out.

557
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,150
A tall, dark man.

558
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,150
Is that him?'

559
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,150
'Yes,' said Silvia.

560
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,150
The man laughed.

561
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,150
'Don't worry about him,' he said.

562
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,150
'He's fine.

563
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,150
My friend and I worked hard.

564
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,150
We pulled him from the rubble, but did he
say, "Thank you"?

565
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,150
No, he didn't!

566
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,150
He was only worried about his car.

567
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,150
He didn't help the other people under the
rubble.

568
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,150
He only had small cuts on his face and hands,
but he wanted to see a doctor.

569
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,150
Other people were dead or nearly dead, but
he wasn't interested in them.

570
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,150
I'm sorry...

571
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,150
Is he your friend?

572
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,150
But really...'

573
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,150
Silvia didn't answer him.

574
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,150
She wanted to think.

575
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,150
Marco wasn't dead!

576
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,150
She was very happy about that, of course.

577
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,150
But she understood now.

578
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,150
She was stupid.

579
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,150
A stupid, stupid girl.

580
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,150
She didn't love Marco.

581
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,150
She didn't like him.

582
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,150
She loved Gabriel.

583
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,150
And now, perhaps, it was too late.

584
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,150
At midnight, there was another small earthquake.

585
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,150
The people in the road screamed.

586
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,150
They wanted to run - but where could they
go?

587
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,150
Behind them, in the town, more buildings fell.

588
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,150
'Oh, no,' thought Silvia.

589
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,150
'When will this end?'

590
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,150
At 12.30 a.m.

591
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,150
Silvia arrived at Liberty Park.

592
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,150
She looked round.

593
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,150
There were thousands of people on the ground.

594
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,150
Other people stood and talked.

595
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,150
She couldn't see very well in the thick smoke.

596
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,150
'I'll never find Mother here,' thought Silvia.

597
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,150
She began to walk up and down the park.

598
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,150
'Mother!'

599
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,150
she called.

600
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,150
'Mother, it's me, Silvia!

601
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,150
Where are you?'

602
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,150
After an hour, she was very tired.

603
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,150
'I have to sit down,' she thought.

604
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,150
'I'll start again in the morning.

605
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,150
But now I'm going to sleep somewhere.'

606
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,150
Then suddenly, she heard her name.

607
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,150
She turned round.

608
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,150
'Mr Garcia!'

609
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,150
she said.

610
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,150
'Where's Mother?'

611
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,150
'She's here,' said Mr Garcia, 'and she's all
right.

612
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,150
But she's very worried about you.

613
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,150
My wife's with her now.

614
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,150
How did you find us?'

615
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,150
'It's a long story,' said Silvia.

616
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,150
'I'll tell you later.

617
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,150
But now ...'

618
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,150
'I know,' said Mr Garcia.

619
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,150
'You want your mother.

620
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,150
Come with me.'

621
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,150
Mrs Delgado was on the ground with Mr Garcia's
jacket under her head.

622
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Her eyes were open, but her face was white.

623
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,150
'Silvia, my dear, you're safe,' she said,
and took Silvia's hand.

624
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,150
'I'm happy now, I'm very happy...'

625
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,150
Silvia took her mother's medicines out of
the bag, and gave her some.

626
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,150
Mrs Delgado smiled.

627
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,150
'Thank you, dear,' she said.

628
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,150
Silvia sat and watched her.

629
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,150
Mrs Delgado shut her eyes and slept.

630
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,150
CHAPTER SEVEN
Thieves

631
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,150
It was early in the morning when Gabriel arrived
at the Delgado's flat.

632
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,150
His arm hurt badly, and he was terribly thirsty.

633
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,150
The street was quieter now.

634
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,150
Most people were out in the country, or in
the parks outside the town.

635
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,150
But there were four or five men at work in
the ruins of the building next door.

636
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,150
They pulled the rubble away.

637
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,150
Gabriel watched them for a minute.

638
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,150
Suddenly, they stopped working and listened.

639
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,150
'I can hear something!'

640
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,150
one man said.

641
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,150
'Here!

642
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,150
I think it's a child.

643
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,150
Quick!

644
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,150
Come and help!'

645
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,150
Gabriel went to them.

646
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,150
'I can help,' he said.

647
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,150
One of them looked up and smiled at him.

648
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,150
'Don't be stupid,' he said.

649
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,150
'You've got to have two hands for this job.

650
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,150
Go and sit down.'

651
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,150
Slowly, Gabriel went up the stairs to the
Delgado's flat.

652
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,150
The building was dangerous, but he didn't
think about that.

653
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,150
He could hear the cries of the child.

654
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,150
He felt terrible.

655
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,150
Then he felt something on the floor under
his foot.

656
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,150
He looked down.

657
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,150
It was his red rose.

658
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,150
It was there, in the same place, by the front
door.

659
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,150
A rose from another world, another life.

660
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,150
The door of the flat was open.

661
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,150
Gabriel called, 'Mrs Delgado!

662
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,150
Silvia!

663
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,150
Are you there?'

664
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,150
There was no answer, but suddenly, two men
ran out of the sitting-room.

665
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,150
The first man went down the stairs before
Gabriel could stop him.

666
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,150
Then the other man ran past.

667
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,150
Gabriel put out his foot and the man fell
over it.

668
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,150
A box fell to the ground.

669
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,150
The man didn't stop.

670
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,150
He jumped up and ran away.

671
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
Gabriel opened the box.

672
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,150
There was jewellery inside it.

673
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,150
'Mrs. Delgado's jewellery!' he thought.

674
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,150
'So the thieves are busy now!'

675
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,150
He took the jewellery box into the flat.

676
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,150
He looked round.

677
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,150
The pictures were on the walls.

678
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,150
Silvia's camera was on the table.

679
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,150
'Good,' he thought.

680
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,150
'The thieves didn't have much time.

681
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,150
They only took the jewellery, and I've got
it now.'

682
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,150
Then, near one of the armchairs, he saw Silvia's
dirty evening shoes.

683
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,150
He thought for a minute.

684
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,150
For the first time for hours, he smiled.

685
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,150
'She wore those shoes last night,' he thought.

686
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
'So she came back here after the earthquake.

687
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,150
She isn't dead!

688
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,150
She came home, and took her mother to a safe
place.

689
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,150
Oh Silvia, Silvia, you're all right!'

690
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,150
Gabriel forgot his broken arm, and the cut
on his head.

691
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,150
He was suddenly happy.

692
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,150
'I'll look for them,' he thought.

693
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,150
They're out in the country.

694
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,150
I know they are.

695
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,150
I'll find them.

696
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,150
I'll...'

697
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,150
He stopped.

698
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,150
'That's stupid,' he thought.

699
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,150
'I'll never find them.

700
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,150
And I can't leave.

701
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,150
There'll be other thieves later.

702
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,150
I'll stay here and look after the flat.'

703
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,150
He went into the kitchen.

704
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,150
There was no water, of course, but there was
some milk.

705
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,150
Gabriel had a long, long drink and then felt
better.

706
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,150
His head and his arm hurt, but his legs felt
stronger.

707
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,150
And now he could think.

708
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,150
'It's not safe inside,' he thought.

709
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,150
'I'll stay in the street.

710
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,150
Perhaps I can help the other men, and watch
the building too.'

711
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,150
He went out of the flat, and shut the door
behind him.

712
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,150
That day and the next day, Gabriel worked
with the other men.

713
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,150
He couldn't move the rubble, or pull people
out of the ruins.

714
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,150
But he could do other jobs.

715
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,150
The workers had to have food and drink.

716
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Gabriel found water and carried it to them.

717
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,150
Then he looked for food.

718
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,150
There was a shop at the end of the street.

719
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,150
The windows and doors were broken.

720
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,150
There was nobody there.

721
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,150
'The manager's dead,' a man told him.

722
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,150
Gabriel climbed through the broken door into
the shop.

723
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,150
He took some food and carried it back to the
workers.

724
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,150
The child from the ruins of the next building
was safe now.

725
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,150
She was in a car, on her way to hospital.

726
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,150
But the workers didn't stop working.

727
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,150
Other people were under the rubble.

728
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
Gabriel could hear their screams.

729
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,150
He saw a small boy in the street, two or three
years old.

730
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,150
The child cried for his mother.

731
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,150
'She's at the hospital,' one of the workers
said.

732
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,150
'We pulled her out.

733
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,150
We didn't know about the child.'

734
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,150
Gabriel sat down next to the little boy and
talked to him.

735
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,150
He gave him some food and a drink of water.

736
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,150
Slowly, the child stopped crying.

737
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,150
Gabriel played with him for hours.

738
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,150
Then his father came and took him away.

739
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,150
On the morning of the third day, firemen arrived.

740
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,150
For the first time, Gabriel stopped working.

741
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,150
He couldn't do anything now.

742
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,150
He sat down in front of the Delgado's door
and fell asleep.

743
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,150
CHAPTER EIGHT
Home

744
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,150
On the third day after the earthquake, good
news came to Liberty Park.

745
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,150
Mr Garcia had a radio in his car.

746
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,150
'Silvia, come and listen!' he called to her.

747
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,150
'There will not be another earthquake,' the
newsreader said.

748
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,150
'People can go back to their homes.

749
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,150
Dangerous buildings have a white cross on
the door.

750
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,150
Do not go inside those buildings.

751
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,150
Other buildings are safe.

752
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,150
I will say that again...'

753
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,150
Mr Garcia and Silvia listened again.

754
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,150
Then Mr Garcia turned the radio off.

755
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,150
'Do you think it's really safe?'

756
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,150
Silvia asked.

757
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
'Do you think we can go home?'

758
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,150
Mr Garcia shook his head.

759
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,150
'I don't know,' he said.

760
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,150
'But I know one thing.

761
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,150
Your mother can't stay here.

762
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,150
We'll take her home to her bed.

763
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,150
You can look after her there.'

764
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,150
Everywhere in Liberty Park people asked questions.

765
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,150
Many people were worried.

766
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,150
Was the newsreader right?

767
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,150
They were afraid of another earthquake.

768
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,150
They wanted to stay in the country for another
day or two.

769
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,150
But other people wanted to go home.

770
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,150
They started to move into the streets.

771
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,150
Silvia sat down next to her mother.

772
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,150
'We're going home, Mother,' she said.

773
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,150
Mr Garcia carried Mrs Delgado carefully to
his car.

774
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,150
She was as light as a child.

775
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,150
Silvia opened the back door of the car, and
Mr Garcia put Mrs Delgado inside.

776
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,150
The journey into town took a long time.

777
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,150
There was rubble everywhere, and in some places
there were trees across the road.

778
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,150
Mr and Mrs Garcia sat in the front of the
car and talked.

779
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,150
They were worried about their flat, their
friends and their neighbors.

780
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,150
Silvia sat in the back with her mother and
looked out of the window.

781
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,150
But she didn't see the ruins, or the rubble,
or the firemen.

782
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,150
She didn't hear the Garcias.

783
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,150
'Will I see Gabriel again?'

784
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,150
she thought.

785
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,150
The car turned into the Delgado's street and
stopped outside their building.

786
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,150
'Look!

787
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,150
Look!

788
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,150
It isn't there!' said Mrs Garcia.

789
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,150
'What isn't there?' asked Silvia.

790
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,150
'The white cross!

791
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,150
There's no white cross on our building.

792
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,150
It's safe!

793
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,150
We can go home!'

794
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,150
Mrs Garcia jumped out of the car and ran up
the stairs to her flat.

795
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,150
Mr Garcia smiled at Silvia.

796
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,150
'You go up first and open the door,' he said.

797
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,150
'My wife will come back in a minute.

798
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,150
Then we'll carry your mother up the stairs.'

799
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,150
Silvia went into the building and up the stairs.

800
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,150
Then she stopped.

801
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,150
There was a man asleep in front of her door.

802
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,150
He looked thin and ill.

803
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,150
His face and clothes were dirty.

804
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,150
And his arm... his head...

805
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,150
'Gabriel!'

806
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,150
she said.

807
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,150
Gabriel woke up and jumped to his feet.

808
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,150
He didn't see Silvia in the dark.

809
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,150
He only saw another thief!

810
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,150
'You can't come in here,' he said.

811
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,150
'This is the Delgado's home.

812
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,150
No thieves here...'

813
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,150
'Gabriel,' said Silvia again.

814
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
Gabriel stopped talking.

815
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,150
His head was hot.

816
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,150
His legs felt weak.

817
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,150
He didn't want to fall now.

818
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,150
Not now.

819
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,150
'Is it you?' he said.

820
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,150
'Is it really you?'

821
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,150
He had something in his hand Silvia couldn't
see it very well.

822
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,150
Then she understood.

823
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,150
It was a dirty, dead, red rose.

824
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,150
She took it out of his hand.

825
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,150
'Thank you, Gabriel,' she said.

826
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
'It's beautiful.'

827
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,152
- THE END -
