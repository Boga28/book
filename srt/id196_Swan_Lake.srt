00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,720
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,040
Prince Zigfried

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,360
Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there 
lived a Prince. His name was Zigfried,  

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,520
and he was very unhappy. His father, the King, 
had died, and since then, everyone in the palace  

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,800
had forgotten how to smile. Without his father, 
Zigfried thought he would never feel happy again.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,000
Every day, Zigfried sat at the window in his room 
in the palace, looking at the birds in the trees.

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,880
"How can they sing and fly so 
free? They must not feel like me."

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
His servant, Ozlowe, tried to 
make the prince smile by telling  

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,280
him jokes or doing funny tricks for 
him. But the Prince would not smile.

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
"I know you love me Ozlowe, but I 
cannot smile. My heart is broken."

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,120
Ozlowe would not give up.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
"Let's go for a walk, good Prince. Maybe we can 
find something outside which will make you happy."

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
"If you wish Ozlowe, but I don't think 
there's anything that can make me happy."

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,640
Ozlowe put on his hunting 
cap, and he took his crossbow.  

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,760
He enjoyed hunting and he hoped to 
catch a bird or a rabbit for the Prince.

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,280
They walked through the forest until they came to 
a lake. On the lake there was a beautiful white  

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:54,560
swan. It had a gold crown on its head, that only 
Princesses wear. The swan swam towards the prince  

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,240
and looked into his eyes. The swan's eyes were 
so sad that Prince Zigfried felt sorry for it.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,840
"Here is a creature which feels worse than I do. 
But why do you have that crown on your head?"

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,200
The swan opened its wings and cried out.

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,080
"I think it's trying to tell me something."

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
Ozlowe had his crossbow in his 
hands. He wanted to shoot the swan.

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
"I'll get that swan for you. 
Prince. Just one minute."

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
"Ozlowe, no!"

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Before Ozlowe could shoot, a magic owl flew 
from a tree and took Ozlowe's cap off his head.  

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:42,240
This cast a spell on him, and he was turned 
to stone. The Prince did not understand.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
"Ozlowe, what has happened to you? Speak to me!"

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,360
He looked back at the lake. The swan was gone.

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
"Everything I do goes wrong. This 
must have happened because of me!"

30
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
The Prince returned to the palace 
sadder than before, thinking to himself:

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,440
"If only Ozlowe were here! There is 
nothing good in my life any more".

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,840
Zigfried's mother came to see him that 
night. She had something important to say.

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,960
"Zigfried, soon you will be eighteen years 
old. You must take your father's place as King.  

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,960
I am having a ball on your birthday 
so that you may choose a wife,  

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,680
and I will invite all the 
princesses from the other kingdoms."

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,320
"But I do not wish to marry, 
Mother. I do not love anyone."

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,000
"You will learn to love someone. First, 
you must stop thinking of yourself."

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,600
"If this will make you happy, I'll do it, Mother."

39
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,800
"It is not for my happiness that I am doing this. 
It is for yours, and all the other people in this  

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:08,480
land. You see, love is more powerful than we 
know. Without it, you will not be a great King."

41
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
His mother left him. He sat at the 
window, thinking of what she had said.  

42
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:27,840
He wanted to love someone with all his 
heart, but he didn't know who it would be.
 
 

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,760
CHAPTER TWO

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,840
The Beautiful Princess

45
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
On the morning of the Royal Ball, 
everybody was very busy in the palace.  

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,840
The Queen's maids were preparing the 
Queen's dress. The servants cleaned  

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,480
the floors and windows, and the cooks were 
cooking enough food for a thousand people.

48
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
The prince looked handsome in his red 
outfit. But he was still not happy.  

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,720
He left the palace to be alone and think, 
and went to the stone statue of Ozlowe.

50
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,160
"It's my birthday today Ozlowe. I'm eighteen. That 
means that I must marry someone and become King.  

51
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,880
The problem is I don't want to 
get married; I don't love anyone."

52
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
There was a quiet splashing in the lake.  

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,480
Zigfried looked and saw the 
beautiful swan with the gold crown.

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,160
"There it is! The beautiful swan has come back."

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,280
He went closer to the water to look at it. Its 
eyes had the same sadness in them, but it was  

56
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,120
happy to see Zigfried and it swam close to him. 
Zigfried looked into its eyes and talked to it.

57
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,920
"I think you understand me. I 
think you know how people feel."

58
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,760
A tear fell from the swan's eye.

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
"Don't cry. You should be 
happy that you are a swan.  

60
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,200
You will never have to marry someone you do not 
love. You will never feel sad when someone dies."  

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,600
The swan made a loud cry. Its wings 
moved back and forth at its sides.  

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,960
Suddenly, an owl appeared as if from nowhere 
and flew at Zigfried's head, but it missed.  

63
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,320
The owl flew off, and the swan began to swim away.

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,320
"Wait. Don't leave."

65
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Zigfried ran round the edge of the lake, following 
the swan. He had to run fast to see where it went.  

66
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,680
Soon, he was in a part of the forest he did 
not know. Tall trees blocked out the sun.  

67
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,920
It was very dark.

68
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:02,800
The swan swam to an ugly old castle. When it 
left the water, something magical happened;  

69
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,040
the swan turned into a beautiful Princess.  

70
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,360
She had long blonde hair and she wore a long 
white dress. The crown was still on her head.  

71
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Zigfried ran to where she 
stood at the castle door.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,840
"Wait! Where are you going?"

73
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
The Princess stopped, but she did not look at him.

74
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,960
"Look at me, please. My name is Prince 
Zigfried and I want to know who you are."

75
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,920
The Princess turned to look at the Prince. 
She had the same dark, sad eyes of the swan.

76
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
"My name is Princess Odile."

77
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,920
"But why were you a swan? Why do you look so sad?"

78
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,400
"An evil wizard called Rocford cast a spell on me.  

79
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
I may only leave the castle 
during the day as a swan."

80
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,920
"Where is this wizard? I will talk to 
him. I will tell him this is wrong."

81
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,360
"No, you mustn't. He will hurt you, I know. 
He does not want me to see another man."

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
"Tell me where this man is! I 
will fight him and free you."

83
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
"No, you must leave. He is dangerous."

84
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,960
"I won't leave until I see 
him; You must be set free."

85
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,360
"Please. You are very kind, but you must go away."

86
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,840
"I won't!"

87
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
She looked into his eyes again.

88
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
"If you want to do something 
for me, you will leave now."

89
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,600
"Odile, I will leave if you want me to. 
But I want you to come to the ball tonight.  

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,240
I must choose a wife and I want to choose you."

91
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,920
"I can't. The wizard won't let me."

92
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,160
"Find a way. Promise me you'll try."

93
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
She spoke softly.

94
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:53,840
"All right. I'll try."
 
 

95
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,400
CHAPTER THREE

96
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,600
Odet

97
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Zigfried left, and Odile went inside the castle. 
Odet, the wizard's evil daughter, was behind a  

98
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:20,240
tree. When she saw Odile talking to the Prince, 
she was jealous; she wanted to go to the ball,  

99
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,400
and what was more, she wanted to marry the Prince.  

100
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
She didn't like Odile, because 
she was so beautiful and kind.  

101
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,840
But the wizard loved her, so Odet couldn't 
do anything to hurt her... until now!

102
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
Odet went to the wizard's 
room, but he was not there.  

103
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,320
The room looked like a museum. There 
was an Egyptian statue against one wall,  

104
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:03,840
and large aquariums full of strange fish. On 
a table stood many different coloured bottles.  

105
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,560
Odet opened one of the bottles. Smoke came 
out of it. It smelled of burning wood.

106
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
The magic owl flew into the 
open window, unseen by Odet,  

107
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,920
and changed back into the 
wizard. "Do you like the smell?"

108
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
"Oh, Father! You scared me."

109
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
"You wouldn't be afraid if you were 
not in my room when I wasn't here."

110
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,680
"I know father, but I have something very 
important to tell you. It's about Odile."

111
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,960
The wizard opened his eyes wide. He was a 
tall man, with a long, white beard and long,  

112
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:54,320
white hair. He wore a big black hat 
and a long black robe with stars on it.

113
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,280
"Tell me what you know!"

114
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
"First, you must promise to do something for me."

115
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,240
"What is it?"

116
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
"I can't tell you now.  

117
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,000
First, I must tell you about Odile, then 
I will ask for something. Will you do it?"

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
"Tell me, before I turn you into a frog!"

119
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,840
The wizard was very much in love with Odile.  

120
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,840
He would change his daughter into a frog 
because he wanted to know about Odile.

121
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,800
"Today, I saw Odile talking to Prince 
Zigfried. The Prince asked Odile to go to  

122
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,960
the royal ball tonight. He wants to marry 
her and free her from your evil powers."

123
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,120
The wizard turned in a circle and 
pointed his hand at the floor.  

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,920
Fire came from his fingers and hit 
the floor. The whole castle shook.

125
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,280
"I should have destroyed the Prince 
today, when I saw him with Odile."

126
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,640
"You saw him, too?"

127
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,840
"Yes, at the lake. I attacked 
him, but I was only an owl.  

128
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Odile knew this and she left him. 
He must have followed her here."

129
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,680
"Oh yes Father, and he is so 
handsome! You should see his face!"

130
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,240
"Silence!"

131
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,360
The wizard turned himself into a large, stone 
ball. He threw himself against the walls,  

132
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:24,160
making the castle shake again. Alone in 
her room, Odile felt the castle shaking.  

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,760
She hid her head under a pillow on her bed; 
she hated it when the wizard got angry.

134
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,080
The wizard changed back into himself in his room.

135
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,640
"Now Father, you promised 
you'd do something for me."

136
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,400
"I never promised you anything!"

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,200
"Oh, Father. I want to go to the 
ball! I want to marry the prince."

138
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:56,000
The wizard angrily raised his hand again. Then, he 
thought of something. Slowly, he lowered his hand.

139
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
"You would like to go to the ball, wouldn't you?"

140
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,640
"Oh yes, Father!"

141
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,480
"And you would like to marry the prince?"

142
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
"Yes, I would."

143
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
"Then you will, and he will 
think that you are Odile."

144
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
"Oh Father, what a wonderful idea!"

145
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,520
She put her arms around him. His body was cold 
as stone, and his eyes were filled with fire.
 
 

146
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
CHAPTER FOUR

147
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
A bird in a cage

148
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,200
Odile's room was at the top of the 
castle tower. Rocford had put her there,  

149
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,680
after he had taken her from her parents. She 
was the most beautiful Princess in the land,  

150
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,680
and her parents were good and kind. Rocford 
had asked her father if he could marry Odile.

151
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,040
"We must ask my daughter what she thinks."

152
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
Odile was brought to the wizard.

153
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,160
"Odile, this man lias asked to 
marry you. He says he is very  

154
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,320
rich and that he will make you the happiest 
princess in the world. What do you think?"

155
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
Odile looked into the wizard's eyes.

156
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,560
"Do you promise to love me forever, 
with all your heart?" Will you love  

157
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,720
me so much that you will not think of what 
you want, even if it hurts you to do this?"

158
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,640
The look in her eyes and her 
questions made Rocford uncomfortable.

159
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,840
"Why do you ask me such questions?  

160
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,320
I told your father I could give 
you everything you could want."

161
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,080
The Princess smiled and turned her head away.

162
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,680
"I'm sorry Father, but I will not marry 
this man. He does not know what love is."

163
00:14:52,400 --> 00:15:00,080
They did not know then that he was a wizard. 
Rocford had looked like a Prince. He wore  

164
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,400
beautiful clothes and looked very handsome. But, 
when he heard what Odile said to her father,  

165
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:17,200
his face began to change. It became old and 
ugly. His clothes changed from blue to black.

166
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,400
"You do not know what you 
are saying, you silly girl.  

167
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,280
I do not have to ask for what I want. I am 
a wizard, and I can do anything I please."

168
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,680
He waved his hands through the air, 
and a fire started in the castle  

169
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,960
where the Princess and her parents lived. He 
had turned Odile into a small bird in a cage,  

170
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,280
and carried her to his castle 
where he locked her up in a tower.

171
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,840
The entire kingdom was destroyed by 
this fire, and her parents were killed.

172
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,680
There was a real bird in a cage in Odile's room at 
the wizard's castle. The wizard had put it there  

173
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,800
so that Odile would remember the power he had over 
her. He only let her leave the castle as a swan  

174
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,840
because he did not want other 
men to fall in love with her.  

175
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,480
At night, she stayed in her room talking 
to the bird, who was her only friend.  

176
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,920
She called the bird Patrice, 
because it was her mother's name.

177
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,560
"Oh Patrice, what should I do? The ball 
is tonight, and I am a prisoner here.  

178
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,440
I believe the Prince loves me with all his heart. 
I saw it in his eyes. He loved me even as a swan."

179
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,600
The bird began moving its wings wildly. It always 
knew when something horrible was about to happen.

180
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
"What is it Patrice, what are you afraid of?"

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,840
Odile heard keys in her locked door. She 
put the bird and its cage behind a curtain,  

182
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,440
because she did not want the bird 
to see what was about to happen.
 
 

183
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,400
CHAPTER FIVE

184
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,720
Odet's New Voice

185
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,000
The wizard entered Odile's room with Odet. 
Odet was the same age and height as Odile,  

186
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,960
but she had dark hair. However, 
she wasn't as beautiful as Odile,  

187
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,560
and this made her very jealous. 
The wizard spoke first.

188
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,560
"Sit down, Odile. I would 
like to ask you something."

189
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,880
The wizard waved his hand and a large and very 
comfortable pink chair appeared. Odile sat on it.

190
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,160
"Odet tells me that you would like to 
go to the ball tonight. Is that true?"

191
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,600
"Yes."

192
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,840
"If I let you go to this ball, 
will you promise to marry me?"

193
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
"I have told you, I will only marry 
a man who loves me and who I love."

194
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
"But you know I love you."

195
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,720
"If you loved me,  

196
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,280
you wouldn't keep me locked up in this 
castle. You wouldn't have killed my parents."

197
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,800
"You are a fool! Would you like 
to marry the Prince? Is that it?"

198
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
"He loves me more than you do."

199
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
"How do you know? He left you here with me.  

200
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
That shows you that you are wrong. He is afraid of 
me. He can't love you very much if he is afraid."

201
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,920
"He did it for me! I asked him to do it!"

202
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,760
"And did you tell him that 
you would go to the ball?"

203
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,800
"Yes."

204
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,720
"Then you lied. You knew I would not let you go."

205
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,720
"I said I would try. He knows that if I do 
not go it is not because I do not want to."

206
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800
"And how does he know this?"

207
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
"You do not have to cast a spell on 
someone or make them rich to love you.  

208
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,680
You understand it by looking in their eyes. 
You know it by the way they speak and act."

209
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,040
"You are a dreamer!"

210
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,240
"And you have no heart!"

211
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,720
"Silence!"

212
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,840
The wizard raised both his 
arms and the castle shook.  

213
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
The curtain on the wall fell down, and 
the wizard saw the bird in the cage.

214
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
"Ah, the bird."

215
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,680
"If you hurt that bird you 
are worse than I thought."

216
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,840
The bird flew wildly as the wizard 
walked towards it. He picked up the cage.

217
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,760
"Now, why would I hurt this bird?  

218
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,760
It is like me. It has no heart. It 
does not feel anything when I do this."

219
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:57,120
The wizard pointed his fingers at Odet. She 
changed into Odile. She had the same blonde hair,  

220
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,840
the same eyes. She was even 
wearing the crown. Odile stood up.

221
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,400
"Tonight, Odet will go to the ball as you, 
Odile. Zigfried will marry her and we will  

222
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,360
see what true love is. Your hearts 
are nothing compared to my magic."

223
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
"You may look like me Odet, but there 
is something missing from your eyes.  

224
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
The prince will know this."

225
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,560
"He does not love you Odile. He 
only loves what you look like."

226
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,840
"I almost forgot!" The wizard waved his hand.

227
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
"Odet, say something."

228
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,320
When Odet spoke, she sounded just like 
Odile. "Hello, Prince Zigfried. It's me,  

229
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:52,720
Odile. I love you." Odile ran to her bed, 
crying. She fell on the bed and covered  

230
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:01,840
her face. Rocford laughed loudly. He took Odet 
out of the room and locked the door behind him.  

231
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:15,840
When Odile looked up, only the bird was 
with her. It too, had a tear in its eye.
 
 

232
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
CHAPTER SIX

233
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,000
The Ball

234
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,560
The ballroom in the palace was very big.  

235
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
There were hundreds of men and 
women dancing in the centre.  

236
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,320
Along the walls there were long white tables. 
They had candles and all kinds of food on them.  

237
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,720
At the top of the room, on a stage, were three 
large chairs. The Queen sat in the middle  

238
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
and Zigfried sat on her right.  

239
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,000
The chair on the left was empty. It was for 
the Princess who would be Zigfried's wife.

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,560
"Which Princess do you like the best?"

241
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,080
"The one I will choose is not here yet."

242
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,440
"But you have met them all, surely?"

243
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
"There is another one, mother, and 
she is a surprise. You will see."

244
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,560
Every time a new guest arrived, the ballroom 
doors were opened, and everyone fell silent.  

245
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,840
A servant called out the 
guests' names as they entered.  

246
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,320
Each time this happened, the Prince became 
very excited. But Odile never arrived.

247
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,400
It was almost twelve o'clock. Zigfried 
had promised his mother that he would  

248
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,360
choose a bride by midnight. 
The two large doors opened.

249
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,440
"Please, let it be her!"

250
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:08,080
It was a giant cake with 18 candles on 
it. Everyone in the room began to sing.

251
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,996
"Happy Birthday to you,

252
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:10,236
Happy Birthday to you,

253
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:23,760
Happy Birthday Prince Zigfried,

254
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:23,817
Happy Birthday to you!"

255
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:26,959
Zigfried and his mother walked 
towards the enormous cake.

256
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,560
"Now, make a wish and blow out all the candles."

257
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,000
No one heard him, but Zigfried said,

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
"I wish Odile would come and be my wife."

259
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,440
He blew out the candles and everyone cheered.  

260
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,840
The doors opened.

261
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,800
"Princess Odile."

262
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,480
It was Odet dressed as Odile.  

263
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,360
She wore a long white dress and long white 
gloves. The gold crown was shining on her head.

264
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,280
She held a bouquet of flowers in her arms. She 
smiled as she walked towards the Queen and Prince.  

265
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,960
She gave the Queen the flowers, then bowed.

266
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,840
"Mother, this is Odile, the 
Princess I met in the forest."

267
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,360
"I knew your father. I'm sorry.  

268
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,000
I thought everyone had died in the fire. 
You must be the only one who lived."

269
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,360
Odet did not know what the wizard had done 
to Odile's parents. She stopped smiling.

270
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,760
"Oh Mother, her story is too sad to 
tell. Let us enjoy this evening together.  

271
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
We are her family now."

272
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,160
"Do you mean you wish to choose 
Princess Odile as your wife?"

273
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,640
"Yes, Mother, I do."

274
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,400
The Queen raised her hand for the men to 
sound their horns. Everyone was quiet.

275
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:17,120
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to announce 
the engagement of my son, Prince Zigfried. After  

276
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:27,840
tonight, he will be the King of this land, and 
he has chosen Princess Odile to be his wife."

277
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,920
Zigfried and Odet danced together. 
Everyone around them clapped their hands.

278
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
"Odile, I knew you would come. How 
did you escape from the evil wizard?"

279
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
"I... I ran away."

280
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,320
"And he did not see you?"

281
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,560
The Prince stepped back so he could look at Odet's 
eyes. His heart sank when he saw those eyes.  

282
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,400
They looked like Odile's, but there 
was something missing in them.  

283
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,840
He didn't love her. Odet began to 
lie about her escape from Rocford.

284
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,040
"I saw a falling star in the sky. 
I closed my eyes and made a wish.  

285
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,680
When I opened them, I was in a carriage 
pulled by horses. That's how I got here.  

286
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,800
It must mean we were meant to be together. Oh 
Zigfried, tell me you will love me forever."

287
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,520
He held her close, because he did not want to 
look in her eyes. He knew he had loved Odile  

288
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,360
when he had first seen her. Now he didn't know. 
He thought there must be something wrong with him.

289
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:52,320
"Odile, I promise always to 
love you and never leave you."
 
 

290
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,120
CHAPTER SEVEN

291
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,440
Odile Escapes

292
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,840
Odile stood at her window, 
looking at the stars and the moon.  

293
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,440
There were bars at the window, but they 
were not necessary. Her window was high  

294
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,840
above a river. If she tried to escape, she would 
almost certainly fall into the water and die.

295
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,600
Her bird, Patrice, chirped behind 
her. She turned to look at the bird.

296
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,560
"Oh Patrice, I understand you. I am in a cage, 
too. But you must want to get out. I'm sorry I  

297
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,520
never thought of it. I have kept you locked 
up just like Rocford has kept me locked up.  

298
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,720
Because you are my only friend in this world, I 
wanted you to stay. But you must be free to fly."

299
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,880
Odile took the bird cage to the 
window. She opened its small door.

300
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,080
"Fly away, Patrice, and be free! Find another bird 
to love. It is the only thing worth living for."

301
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:07,600
The bird flew from its cage, through the bars on 
the window, into the night. Odile closed her eyes.  

302
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,600
She imagined that she was Patrice 
flying over the forest and lake.  

303
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,760
She flew into the garden of the palace, she 
landed on a palace wall and looked into a  

304
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,840
large window at the ball. Beautiful women in 
beautiful dresses were dancing with handsome men.

305
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:36,640
She saw the prince with his mother and the 
cake with the eighteen candles. Then, Odet  

306
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:47,440
entered the room dressed as her. When she opened 
her eyes, she found to her amazement that she was  

307
00:28:47,440 --> 00:29:00,320
outside the palace window. When she had set the 
bird free, she had also set herself free. Because  

308
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,920
she believed with all her heart in love and 
freedom, everything that she imagined came true.

309
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,840
The wizard knew that Odile hated 
him, and it made him angry.  

310
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,240
He wanted to make her love him, so 
he decided to have a ball for her.  

311
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,840
Using his magic, he made a large room full 
of people dancing. He changed himself into a  

312
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,440
young man again, the same young man he was 
when he had taken Odile from her parents.

313
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,600
He went to her room with 
flowers. He knocked on her door.

314
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,360
"Odile, I have a surprise for you."

315
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,440
There was no answer. He 
couldn't even hear the bird.

316
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,800
"Odile, it's me, Rocford. I've 
decided to take you to a ball."

317
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,160
When there was no answer and he 
heard nothing, he became angry.  

318
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:13,040
He made the door disappear. His anger turned 
him back into the old, evil man that he was.  

319
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,200
He saw the bird cage on the 
floor. The room was empty.  

320
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Roaring with anger, he turned himself into an owl 
and flew from the castle towards the palace.
 
 

321
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,680
CHAPTER EIGHT

322
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
The Prince Chases the Princess

323
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,480
When Odile saw Odet dancing with Zigfried, she ran 
to the palace entrance. The guards stopped her.

324
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,840
"Who are you?"

325
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,960
"My name is Princess Odile. 
The Prince is expecting me."

326
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,400
"No. Princess Odile has already 
entered. You must be lying."

327
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,840
"Please, you must believe me. That 
is not Princess Odile. She is lying."

328
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,120
But the guards wouldn't believe 
her. She ran back to the window  

329
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,680
and knocked hard on it. 
Everyone turned to look at her.  

330
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,080
The Prince could not believe what he 
saw - two Odiles. He looked at Odet.

331
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,080
"What is going on?"

332
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,880
"I don't know. The evil wizard must 
have changed someone to look like me."

333
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:37,600
Odile kept knocking on the window. She was 
crying. Zigfried could now see that she had  

334
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:46,720
the same eyes as the swan. Rocford flew down next 
to Odile as the owl. He held her in both arms.

335
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,600
"Did you think you could escape from me?"

336
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,280
The Prince ran from the ballroom. He 
saw Odile fighting with the wizard.

337
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,760
"Take your hands off her, Rocford."

338
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,040
Rocford let go of Odile's arms.

339
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,600
"I should have killed you that day at the 
lake. But I will be happy to do it now."

340
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,400
The wizard lifted up his hand. Odile stopped him.

341
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,440
"Wait! Don't do it. I'll go with you. I'll 
do what you want. Just don't hurt him."

342
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,680
"Odile, what are you saying? 
Don't leave me again!"

343
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,200
She could not look at him, because if 
she did, she would not want to leave.

344
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,080
"I'm doing this for us. If 
you die, I will die with you.  

345
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,520
It is better for us to live and 
hope to be together one day."

346
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,640
Odet ran out of the palace. 
She still looked like Odile.

347
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,320
"Who is this, then?"

348
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,920
"It is Odet, the wizard's evil daughter.  

349
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,680
She only looks like me. Look 
into her eyes and you will know."

350
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,360
"I knew it."

351
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,840
Odet also had magical powers. She 
changed herself back to her real body.

352
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,840
"It is too late Zigfried. You promised 
to marry me and love me forever.  

353
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,120
If you do not keep this promise, you 
will never be able to keep another."

354
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,640
Odet changed herself into a bird. The 
wizard was an owl and Odile was a swan.  

355
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,160
They flew together away from the 
palace, back to Rocford's castle.  

356
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,800
The Queen and many others came out of 
the palace to see what had happened.  

357
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,320
Zigfried went after Odile. 
"Guards, bring me my horse."

358
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,480
"Zigfried, where are you 
going? Where is the Princess?"

359
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,840
"She has gone away, Mother, and I must find her."

360
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,200
The guards brought the prince a beautiful 
white horse, and gave him his sword.

361
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,160
"Do you want us to call the men, Your Highness?"

362
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,200
"No, this is something I must do alone."

363
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,040
"Zigfried, do not leave the palace alone.  

364
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,000
If something happens to you, we will be without 
a king. It is your duty to stay with me!"

365
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,920
"Mother, being a King means nothing if 
you are not with the woman you love.  

366
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,440
I would rather die than leave 
Odile with that evil wizard."

367
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:19,840
The Prince spurred his horse on and 
rode quickly towards the dark forest.
 
 

368
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,600
CHAPTER NINE

369
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,520
The Fir

370
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,600
Rocford, Odet and Odile flew onto the tower 
of the castle. They changed back into people.  

371
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,040
Odile was weeping loudly. The wizard 
just laughed his evil laugh and said:

372
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
"Odile, now I know how to get 
you to marry me. If you don't,  

373
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,840
I will kill the Prince, and 
you will watch him die."

374
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
"Father, you do not have to kill Zigfried.  

375
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,560
He has already promised to marry 
me. He cannot break such a promise."

376
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,440
"Neither of you has a heart.  

377
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,520
How can you ever expect to be happy if 
you know that someone does not love you?  

378
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,840
But you will see. Love is stronger than spells. 
You will never succeed in getting what you want."

379
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,320
At this, they saw Zigfried coming 
towards the castle on his horse.

380
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,440
"We shall see which is stronger, love or hate!"

381
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,360
The wizard made a wall of fire appear in front 
of Zigfried. Zigfried could only think of Odile.  

382
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,080
He rode right through the 
fire without getting hurt.

383
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,360
Odile said triumphantly: "You see. I am right."

384
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,280
As she ran from the wizard, he tried to block her 
way by making the doors close in front of her.  

385
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,720
But Odile just ran faster 
and escaped through each one.

386
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,360
The Prince saw Odile on the steps going 
up to the tower. He took her in his arms.

387
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,640
"Odile, I will never let you leave me again. 
Say that you will stay with me forever."

388
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,520
"I will, I will! I love you Zigfried!"

389
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,480
The wizard appeared at the top of 
the steps. Odet was behind him.

390
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,000
"You will not escape death this time, Zigfried."

391
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,360
The Prince took out his sword. 
Odile tried to stop him.

392
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,960
"Do not fight him, Zigfried. If he kills 
you, I will lose everyone I've ever loved."

393
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,840
"You are right Odile. Zigfried is only a boy. He 
is no match for me. Now, come back to your room,  

394
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,720
and let this little boy go home to his mother."

395
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,800
"Rocford, your words will not discourage 
me. I would kill you now, but I will give  

396
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,120
you one last chance to live. Let us leave 
in peace and never come near Odile again."

397
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,560
"You really are a little boy if 
you think that you can harm me."

398
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,720
Rocford raised his hand, and Odile flew 
through the air to where Odet stood.  

399
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,640
Zigfried ran at Rocford and tried to stab 
him with his sword. Rocford put his hand  

400
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:11,600
up. The sword touched it and turned into water. 
Without a sword, Zigfried attacked the wizard.  

401
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,120
Rocford threw Zigfried down the steps. He 
picked up a stick and turned it into a sword.  

402
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,640
He pointed it at Zigfried's 
heart as he lay on the ground.

403
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
"Rocford! Don't!"

404
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,880
"Say you will marry me Odile, 
and I will let him live."

405
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,200
''Don't do it Odile! Don't make 
yourself more unhappy just for me!"

406
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,320
The wizard prodded Zigfried with the sword.

407
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,640
"And you have promised to marry me, 
Zigfried. You said you would always love me."

408
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,160
"I said that because I thought you were Odile. 
I would never marry you. I would rather die."

409
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Zigfried took the wizard's sword and 
pushed it deep into his own heart.

410
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,400
"Zigfried, no!"

411
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,680
Something strange began to 
happen. The castle began to shake.  

412
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,080
Large stones fell from the ceiling, 
and Rocford and Odet were killed.  

413
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,720
Odile ran to Zigfried. She 
took the sword out of his heart  

414
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:31,840
and pulled his body out of the castle, 
before it fell to the ground.
 
 

415
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,200
CHAPTER TEN

416
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,840
The Wedding

417
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,320
Dawn broke in the forest, but no birds sang. 
The castle was nothing but a pile of stones.  

418
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,360
The only sound was Odile 
crying over Zigfried's body.

419
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,960
"Oh Zigfried, my one true 
love! Why did you have to die?"

420
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,640
At this, the Prince opened 
first one eye, then the other.

421
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,680
"You're alive! Oh, Zigfried!"

422
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
She hugged the Prince and 
cried tears of happiness.

423
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,600
"I love you, Odile. I knew that my love was 
stronger than that sword. Nothing is more  

424
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,840
powerful than a person's heart. Tell me you 
will marry me, and I will love you forever."

425
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,320
"Of course I will Zigfried.  

426
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,480
You have made my dreams come true. 
We were right to believe in love!"

427
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,840
They left the old castle 
together on Zigfried's horse.  

428
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,640
When they came to the lake near 
the palace, they saw Ozlowe.  

429
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,840
He was not a statue anymore. 
He stood scratching his head.  

430
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,160
All of the wizard's spells had been broken 
when he died. The Prince was full of joy.

431
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,440
"Ozlowe!"

432
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,960
"Master Zigfried, I don't know what happened. 
I was standing here about to shoot a swan."

433
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
"That will teach you never to kill 
anything. This is Princess Odile.  

434
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,640
She was the swan you tried to kill."

435
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,920
Ozlowe was very confused.

436
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,840
"Prince Zigfried, I think I'd better 
go to bed. I don't feel very well."

437
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,360
When the servants and the Queen heard 
about Zigfried and Odile's marriage,  

438
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,800
there was a big celebration.  

439
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,560
All the people in the land and the surrounding 
kindoms were invited to the wedding.  

440
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,000
It took place at the edge of the lake, 
where Zigfried had first seen Odile.

441
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,680
Odile wore a beautiful long wedding dress. 
Zigfried's mother walked towards them.

442
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,040
"Zigfried, I want you to know 
that what you did was right.  

443
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,400
Though I asked you to stay at the palace, you 
left for a better reason. You should always  

444
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:18,560
follow your heart, especially when it is full 
of love. You father would be very proud of you."

445
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,640
Zigfried's mother was so happy she had tears 
in her eyes. The Prince took Odile's hands.  

446
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,840
They stood together in front of the lake. The 
Queen put the King's crown on Zigfried's head.  

447
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,600
The priest spoke to the new King and Queen.

448
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:47,920
"Marriage is a wonderful thing. And what makes 
this marriage special is that the love you have  

449
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,600
for each other will affect everyone 
in this land. Through your happiness,  

450
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:02,160
we will become happy. Through your love for each 
other, we will love each other. Is this what you  

451
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,400
want? Is your love strong enough to lead a 
land of people who need joy in their lives?"

452
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,640
Odile spoke first.

453
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,080
"It is."

454
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,920
"Of course, it is!"

455
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,040
"Then by the power that is given to me by 
God, I pronounce you husband and wife."

456
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,680
At that moment a joyful chirp was heard  

457
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,720
and a little bird flew from a 
rose bush and sat on Odile's hand.

458
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,400
"Patrice, my little friend! You're back!"

459
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,160
Then Odile turned to Zigfried and said:

460
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,720
"You see my beloved King, love 
is stronger than anything in  

461
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,200
this world. When you love somebody 
or something you never lose them."

462
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:57,840
Zigfried looked lovingly into his bride's 
eyes, they kissed and everybody cheered.
 
 
 
 

463
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,619
- THE END -
