CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,960
Tug is Taken Away

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,040
DAY ONE - SUNDAY 7TH AUGUST

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,200
Tug was running. His legs ached, his feet hurt, 
all his body was screaming at him to stop running.  

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,840
But he didn't want to stop. He wanted today's 
run to be better and faster than ever before.  

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,600
Now he was nearly at the end of his run, and 
his legs were burning, but he still went on  

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,920
running. As he came round the last street corner, 
he saw his own front door, a hundred metres away.  

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,680
I mustn't stop now! he thought. I promised 
myself I'd do eight kilometres, and I will!

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,080
The church bells were ringing, and 
the blood was beating in his ears.  

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,560
Suddenly it all seemed easy, and his legs felt 
strong. I can do it! he said happily to himself.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,720
He reached the front door, and looked at 
his watch. 36 minutes 20 seconds. At last!  

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,120
Eight kilometres in less than 37 minutes! 
I've been trying to do that for weeks!

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,720
He put his key in the door. Now he could have 
a hot bath. His mother would get home later.  

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,880
She had promised to cook him a 
special meal - chicken and chips,  

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,880
and a chocolate cake. He smiled 
as he pushed open the door.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,280
Strange! The house was dark, too dark. And 
there was something more... But he was too  

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,480
tired to think. Suddenly there was an arm 
round his neck and a hand over his face.  

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
He fell, and everything went black.

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,960
DAY TWO - MONDAY 8TH AUGUST
Fifteen hours later and  

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
two hundred kilometres away in Derbyshire, 
Jinny Slattery came out of the farmhouse.  

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,160
In the moonlight she could see the ridge 
of mountains called Ashdale Great Edge.  

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,160
It stood, black and frightening, against the 
sky, with the Castle Rock at its southern end.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,600
Jinny walked away from the farmhouse, and took 
the narrow road up the hill. It was two o'clock in  

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,920
the morning, and very quiet. When she reached some 
trees, her father stepped out and touched her arm.

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,840
'Oh!' she cried in surprise, and felt angry 
with herself. He had told her to be quiet.

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,240
'Follow me,' Joe said, and went on up 
the road. He walked quickly and silently,  

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,680
his dog just behind him.

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
I must remember what he told 
me to do, Jinny thought.

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,840
I don't want to make a mistake!

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
Now they were high up on the moors. 
Further along was an old cottage,  

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,400
which Mrs Hollins used to rent to 
summer visitors. It was almost hidden  

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,680
by trees. On the right was a gate into a 
field, the field which they had chosen.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,920
Jinny felt sick. She knew what would happen next. 
Joe had already filled every hole in the hedges  

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,520
round the field, so the gate was the only way 
out. Now he was putting a net over the gate.

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
Just then they heard a car driving up the road.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,080
'Where is it going?' asked Jinny. 'This road 
only goes to the moors and Mrs Hollins' cottage.'

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
'Visitors,' said Joe softly, 
'probably renting the cottage.  

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,800
Keep quiet, they won't see us in the dark.'

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
The car drove slowly past them and 
stopped in front of the cottage.  

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
Jinny could hear the voices of a man 
and a woman, and then a strange noise.  

41
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,320
Were they pulling something heavy into the 
house? She couldn't see what was happening.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,000
When it was quiet again, Joe 
said softly, 'Remember, Jinny.  

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Remember everything I told you,' and went 
silently into the field, followed by his dog.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Jinny was shaking now, not from cold but from 
fear and excitement. She knew that Joe and the  

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,520
dog were moving slowly through the field. She 
thought of the hare, lying asleep in the grass.  

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,440
It would try to escape through the gate. 
Then she must do what Joe had told her.

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,920
I can't! she thought. But she had 
to do it. 'If you want to eat meat,  

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,280
you must be able to kill an animal,' Joe had 
said. 'Why should other people do it for you?'

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,920
But in the end it almost seemed easy. The hare 
tried to jump through the gate and was caught  

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,120
in the net. Automatically Jinny hit its neck hard, 
and the hare's warm dead body fell at her feet. As  

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,280
she was looking at it, Joe arrived. 'Good girl,' 
he said, and started taking the net off the gate.

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
Just then a loud noise broke the silence.  

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,480
It was the sound of hammering, 
and it came from the cottage.

54
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,200
'What's that?' Jinny cried. But Joe didn't stop 
what he was doing. 'Nothing to do with us,'  

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,400
he replied. That was what he always said.  

56
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,200
For him the Slattery family was much 
more important than the outside world.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
'But if someone hears,' said Jinny, 
'they'll come up here to see,  

58
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
and then the police will catch us... 
stealing hares that don't belong to us!'

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,160
'Don't worry,' said Joe calmly. 'From the village 
you can't hear anything that happens up here.  

60
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,240
We'll make sure that we get home 
with the hare before anyone comes.'

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,840
They walked down the road to the farmhouse. 
I'm not like Joe, thought Jinny. I always  

62
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
want to know why things happen. And I want 
to know what's happening in that cottage!
 
 

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
10.00 A.M.
Seven hours later,  

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,400
Tug woke up in the cottage. The room was 
full of sunshine and very loud music.  

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,080
Above him was a high window, with strong 
bars across it, and blue sky outside.

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,640
It must be a dream. He wanted to wake up,  

67
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,120
and find himself in his own bedroom. 
But the dream did not go away.

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,720
Suddenly he noticed a woman at the door. She 
was about thirty, and very thin, with long legs,  

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,080
long brown hair and long fingers. But her eyes 
were the most interesting thing about her.  

70
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
They were large and yellow-brown, almost golden.

71
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
She said something, but he couldn't 
hear her because of the music.  

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
'Sorry, I didn't hear that,' he said.

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,200
'I said how are you feeling?' she shouted angrily.

74
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,040
Tug tried to sit up. When he moved his 
head, he felt sick. 'What happened?'  

75
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,400
he asked. 'I don't remember this place.' 
He was sure he had never been there before.

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
The woman sounded careless, unworried.  

77
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,920
'You fell... hit your head ... 
we had to carry you upstairs...'

78
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,400
It was important, but he couldn't 
hear because the music was so loud.  

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
'It's too noisy! We can't talk!' he shouted.

80
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720
She didn't answer, but opened the 
bedroom door and shouted to someone.  

81
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,840
The music was louder through the open door. Tug 
couldn't think, and his head was still hurting.

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,560
A man came into the room, with slow, unhurried 
steps. He had a strangely white face,  

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,840
with cold blue eyes and thick black hair. The 
woman spoke quietly to him. Tug couldn't hear.

84
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,640
'Look,' said Tug. He wanted to sound as polite as 
possible. 'I don't remember anything. Where am I?  

85
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,280
And how did I get here? And who are you? 
Please will you tell me what's happening?'

86
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,320
'Don't worry,' said the man 
coldly. 'You hit your head  

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,080
and you've forgotten a few things. 
That's all. You'll be fine after a rest.'

88
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,360
He turned to go, but Tug reached 
out for his arm. 'Please!'  

89
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,760
he cried wildly. 'You must tell me something!

90
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,400
'We're in the cottage that we've rented 
for our holiday, in the north of England.  

91
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,320
You remember? Now try and sleep.'

92
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,000
'But who are you?' shouted Tug. They 
were both leaving the room. The man  

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,480
said something that Tug didn't hear, ... 
mirror...' and closed the door behind him.  

94
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Tug jumped out of bed and ran 
to the door, but it was locked.

95
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:39,120
Suddenly he felt very cold. The music still filled 
his head, but it didn't stop him thinking now. He  

96
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,080
had hoped this was all a mistake, that they would 
answer his questions and explain everything,  

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,520
or take him home. But now he realized that they 
wanted to keep him a prisoner in that room.

98
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,320
It was a small room just under the roof, with 
only a bed and a cupboard in it. He looked up at  

99
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,760
the window above his head. They had hammered the 
bars on to it very recently. He couldn't escape  

100
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,880
that way. He sat on the bed and put his head in 
his hands. He had never felt so miserable and  

101
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,960
frightened before. Just then he thought of his 
mother. He knew what she would say to him now.  

102
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,800
Why do you always feel sorry for yourself? Get up 
and do something! He felt better when he thought  

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,760
of her small angry face. Cheer up, Tug! he told 
himself, and got up to look in the cupboard.

104
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,880
He was very pleased to find his clothes there, all 
ready for him to wear. But as he reached for them,  

105
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
he noticed something. On the inside 
of the door was a long mirror.  

106
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,560
What had the man said? Something about a 
mirror. Slowly Tug turned to look at himself.

107
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,640
And for a second he was in a bad dream. 
Because the face in the mirror was not his.  

108
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,040
Then he realized what was different - his hair. It 
was black, not fair. His face seemed very white,  

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,480
and his blue eyes looked coldly back at him. He 
looked at himself in the mirror for a long time.  

110
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,720
With the black hair, white 
face and cold blue eyes,  

111
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
he looked just like the man. 
He could almost be his son.
 
 

112
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,440
12.45 P.M.
Jinny ran into the village.  

113
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,280
Her father had asked her to post something, so 
she wanted to get to the post office before it  

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,880
closed for lunch. Outside the post office 
she saw Rachel Hollins sitting on a wall.  

115
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Rachel's father was the village policeman, and her 
mother worked in the post office. Rachel was very  

116
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,240
pretty, and always wore beautiful clothes. 'Hello 
Jinny!' she cried. 'Do you like my new dress?'

117
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
'Very nice,' replied Jinny crossly. 'But I 
couldn't wear that for working on the farm.'

118
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,160
'Oh, I forgot!' said Rachel. She smiled sweetly - 
too sweetly, and Jinny wanted to hit her. 'I'm so  

119
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:14,320
sorry! Poor Jinny! You have to work so hard and 
you never have any new clothes and... She stopped  

120
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,840
as she saw someone behind Jinny 'I must go in and 
have lunch,' she said quickly, and ran inside.

121
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,720
Jinny turned to see who was 
behind her. It was a woman,  

122
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
with the strangest, loveliest eyes she had ever 
seen - big, yellow-brown eyes, almost golden.  

123
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,440
Hares eyes, thought Jinny. The woman looked 
like a hare, with her long legs and thin face.

124
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
'I can see that girl only thinks about clothes,'  

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,080
said the Hare-woman to Jinny, 
and walked into the post office.  

126
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:53,120
Jinny watched her go. What an interesting woman! 
she thought. And she understands about Rachel!

127
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Inside the post office the one 
o'clock news was on the radio.  

128
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,520
The Hare-woman, Mrs Hollins, 
and Jinny all listened.
 
 

129
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,680
Terrorists are holding 
thirteen-year-old Liam Shakespeare,  

130
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Harriet Shakespeare's son, at the family 
home in London. Police are trying to...
 
 

131
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,800
'How terrible!' said Mrs Hollins. 'That poor boy!'

132
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,040
'Who's Harriet Shakespeare?' asked Jinny.

133
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,640
'You haven't heard of her?' asked the Hare-woman 
in surprise. 'She's a television reporter,  

134
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,280
always looking for other people's 
secrets. Thinks herself very important.'

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,760
Mrs Hollins pretended to feel sorry for 
Jinny. 'Poor girl, she doesn't have any  

136
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,640
newspapers or radio or television in her house,' 
she explained. 'Her family grow their own food,  

137
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,240
make their own clothes. They 
never buy anything new!'

138
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,040
Mrs Hollins always laughs at us Slatterys, 
thought Jinny. 'We prefer to do everything  

139
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,760
for ourselves,' she said. She really 
wanted the stranger to understand.

140
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,480
But Mrs Hollins had started talking about the 
news again. 'That poor Harriet Shakespeare!  

141
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,520
She must be very worried. A mother always 
worries about her children. Have you any  

142
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:24,160
children?' she asked the Hare-woman. 'Ye-es, 
yes, I have. A son, Philip, almost fourteen.'

143
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,400
'Well, well! My daughter Rachel and Jinny here are 
both nearly fourteen. Are you staying near here?'

144
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,320
The Hare-woman laughed. 'Well, yes, we're staying 
in your cottage. We arrived late last night.'

145
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,320
'Oh, you're Mrs Doyle!' Mrs Hollins 
said, and shook the stranger's hand  

146
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,120
warmly. So the Hare-woman was one of the 
visitors to the cottage thought Jinny.

147
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,560
'In fact, I hope we didn't wake 
everyone in the village up last night,'  

148
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,080
said the Hare-woman. 'Philip fell 
over and crashed into some furniture.  

149
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,040
There was a terrible noise. He hit his 
head, so he'll be in bed for a while.'

150
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,800
Jinny said nothing, but she knew that wasn't true.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,240
'We were very tired,' continued the 
Hare-woman, 'so we took Philip upstairs  

152
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,520
and went to bed immediately.'

153
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,680
Another lie! thought Jinny. You 
didn't go to bed immediately.  

154
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,760
You hammered and hammered. Why are you lying?

155
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
Suddenly the Hare-woman 
seemed to remember something.  

156
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
She stopped talking, bought 
some food and hurried out.

157
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,280
Jinny walked slowly back to the farm. 
At first she had liked the stranger,  

158
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,040
with her beautiful honest eyes. 
But why was she lying?
 
 
 
 

159
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,800
CHAPTER TWO

160
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COTTAGE?

161
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,440
DAY THREE - TUESDAY 9TH AUGUST

162
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
8.00 A.M.

163
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,360
Tug was lying on the bed. He hadn't slept since 
the Man and the Woman walked out after their  

164
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,280
first visit, hours ago. The music had a strong 
beat which hammered at the inside of his head,  

165
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,040
and it hadn't stopped all 
night. He was very tired,  

166
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,520
and hungry and thirsty. But he was 
watching the door and waiting for Them.

167
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,320
When the door opened, the music was louder for 
a moment as the Man entered. He looked at Tug.

168
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,880
'Did you sleep well?' he asked, after a moment.

169
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,880
'No,' said Tug. 'I - I'm thirsty.'

170
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,520
'Have some water,' answered the Man. 'I've brought 
some.' And he offered Tug a glass of water.

171
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,120
I'm not taking anything from you, Tug wanted 
to say, before you tell me what's happening.  

172
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,560
But he was so thirsty! He took 
the glass and drank all the water.  

173
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
Then he turned to the Man and said, 'Tell me-'

174
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
'Sit down on the bed,' ordered the Man.

175
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,400
Something in the Man's face told Tug 
that it was not a good idea to refuse.  

176
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,840
He sat down. The Man opened the door and, while 
watching Tug carefully, put his arm outside.  

177
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,400
And suddenly the music stopped.

178
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,520
Tug fell back on the bed, free from the terrible 
noise at last. The room was beautifully silent.

179
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,600
Then he heard someone climbing the stairs. 
The Woman walked in. She was carrying a tray.

180
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:34,240
'Breakfast,' she said. 'Look.' It was a 
dream breakfast. A big plate of fried eggs,  

181
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,280
tomatoes and bread, with a cup of hot, strong tea.

182
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,040
Tug could not stop looking at the tray. But the 
Woman did not move. She stayed near the door.

183
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,400
'Well?' he said at last. 'Isn't it for me?'

184
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,960
'Oh yes,' she replied. 'It's for 
you. But what do you say first?'

185
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm not a child! thought Tug angrily. She's 
teaching me to be polite! But he was very hungry.

186
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
'Thank you,' he said.

187
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,680
'Thank you - what?' she asked.

188
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,320
'I don't understand,' said Tug. Is this a game?

189
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,520
'You usually call her something,' said the Man.

190
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
Tug began to see what they 
wanted. Were they serious?  

191
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,520
He pretended that he still didn't understand.

192
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,840
'What do you mean? What do I usually call her?'

193
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,360
It was the Woman who answered. 'You usually call 
me Ma. And your breakfast will be cold soon.'

194
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
But Tug wasn't ready to do what they wanted yet.  

195
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,400
He turned to the Man. 'And 
I suppose I call you Dad!'

196
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,360
'No,' smiled the Man calmly. 'You could, 
but you don't. You call me Doyle.'

197
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Doyle... Ma... Tug looked from one to the other. 
It almost seemed true. Suddenly he shouted,  

198
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,560
'You're crazy! All that's rubbish! Why 
don't you explain what's happening...'

199
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,640
The door banged shut. The Woman had walked 
out and taken his breakfast with her.

200
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,680
'That was stupid of you,' said 
Doyle. 'She's angry with you.  

201
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,880
Mothers are like that sometimes, aren't they?'

202
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,040
'But -' said Tug, and stopped. He could 
hear her climbing up the stairs again.

203
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
'Now be careful this time,' said Doyle quietly.

204
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,480
The Woman entered again, with the tray. Tug 
could smell the hot food. It looked wonderful.

205
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,080
'Breakfast,' said the Woman, for the second time.

206
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,240
What does it matter? thought Tug. Ma isn't 
what I call my mother. I call her Hank.

207
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,320
'Thank you - Ma,' he said. The Woman gave him the 
tray, and left the room. As Doyle followed her,  

208
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,720
he turned and smiled slowly at Tug. 
'Have a good breakfast - Philip.'

209
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,280
'I'm not Philip!' Tug shouted. 'And you're not 
my parents!' But the door had already closed.

210
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,960
And then the music started. With 
that terrible beat in his head,  

211
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
he wasn't sure of anything any more.
 
 

212
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,440
10.00 A.M.
Jinny was digging in the garden.  

213
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,440
While she was working, she was talking angrily to 
herself. Forget it! Its nothing to do with you!  

214
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,280
But she couldn't stop herself thinking of 
the Hare-woman. Why had she lied about the  

215
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,760
noises in the night? And why had there 
been so much hammering at the cottage?

216
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Suddenly she had an idea. She 
could go up to the cottage now.  

217
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
She knew that she should go on with her 
work - there were always lots of jobs to  

218
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,920
do on the Slatterys' small farm - but she 
really wanted to understand the mystery.  

219
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,760
Perhaps the Hare-woman had a good reason for lying 
and perhaps she would tell Jinny all about it...

220
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,560
Soon she was walking up the narrow road to the 
moors. The cottage was on the left, but she didn't  

221
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,400
go up to it. She climbed up the small hill behind 
the house, and hid in the trees halfway up the  

222
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,080
hill. She couldn't see anybody in the cottage, 
but she could hear a radio playing loud music.

223
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,840
Something was different about the 
cottage... Jinny went a few steps nearer,  

224
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
to look more closely at the window in the roof...

225
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
Suddenly a voice spoke from below. 'Hallo.'

226
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,000
'Oh!' cried Jinny in surprise, and 
the branch that she was holding broke.  

227
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,560
She fell, and slid all the way down 
the hill to the cottage garden.

228
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,240
'Well, well!' said the voice.  

229
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Jinny looked up. It was a man with black 
hair and cold blue eyes. He looked angry.

230
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,920
Jinny thought fast.  

231
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,880
'I - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to - You see, I was 
looking for - for - mushrooms.' Would he believe  

232
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,720
her? She continued quickly, 'They're very good 
to eat, er, fried in butter, for breakfast -'

233
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,760
'Yes.' The cold voice stopped her. 'But perhaps 
you'd like to find a different place to look for  

234
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,680
mushrooms. We're here on holiday, you see, and we 
don't want people crashing in through the kitchen  

235
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,120
window.' He was holding her by the arm as he 
spoke, and pulling her away from the cottage.  

236
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,200
Jinny was frightened.

237
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,880
Just then she heard a single wild shout from 
inside the cottage, followed immediately  

238
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,680
by a crashing sound. The loud music went on 
playing. The man shouted towards the house,  

239
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,040
'Oh, be quiet, Philip!' He's pretending 
to be a father who's angry with his son,  

240
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,840
thought Jinny, but I don't believe him! Why is he 
so cold and unfriendly? Is he hiding something?

241
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,960
But she was shaking a little after her 
fall, and she was still afraid of the man.  

242
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,760
So she pulled her arm away, and 
said quickly, 'I - I must go home.'  

243
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,840
She knew that he was watching her as 
she hurried away from the cottage.
 
 

244
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,040
10.30 A.M.
The music was still playing in the bedroom.  

245
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,320
Tug had just finished his breakfast when 
he heard the noise of Jinny's fall outside.  

246
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,120
He jumped on to the bed and looked out of the 
window. He could only see the sky and the tops of  

247
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,480
trees, but he heard a girl saying, 'They're very 
good to eat, fried in butter, for breakfast -' Who  

248
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,840
was she? Could he send her a message? Would it 
be dangerous? Then he heard feet running up the  

249
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,040
stairs. It was now or never. He pushed open the 
window and shouted as loudly as possible, 'Help!'

250
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,600
The next moment the Woman had crashed into him.  

251
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,920
He fell on to the floor, and she held him 
down with one strong hand over his mouth.  

252
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,400
She only let him get up when she heard 
the Man come back into the house.

253
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,280
'Right!' she said. 'Now you learn to obey 
orders!' She hit him hard across the face,  

254
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,480
on one side and then the other. She went 
on hitting him, in time to the beat of  

255
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,440
the music. Tug began to think that she would 
never stop. He was trying hard not to scream,  

256
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,320
because when he started, he would go on and on, 
like her... Then suddenly Doyle was there. He put  

257
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:40,000
a finger on the Woman's arm. Just one finger. 
And no words. But it was enough. She stopped.

258
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:49,840
'Stupid woman,' said Doyle calmly. 'Stupid to hit 
his face. Get some water.' She went downstairs.

259
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,840
'She hit me,' said Tug. 'Just because I -'

260
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,240
'You have to understand,' Doyle said 
quietly. 'We'll kill you if we have to.'

261
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,120
The room seemed very quiet, although the music 
was still playing. I've never been really afraid  

262
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,800
before, thought Tug. He was full of a deep, cold 
fear. For the first time in his life, he realized  

263
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:22,080
that he could die. Not in a hundred years, or 
when he was very old, but now. Today or tomorrow.

264
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,040
But the moment passed. Soon Doyle and the Woman 
were washing Tug's face, like careful parents.  

265
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
When the Woman left the 
room, Doyle sat by the door.  

266
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,080
Now he had a gun with him, which he was cleaning. 
Tug could not take his eyes off the cold grey gun.  

267
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,080
Perhaps he's going to kill me 
now... to shoot me with the gun...

268
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,200
At last Doyle put the gun down. Suddenly 
angry, Tug shouted, 'How can you two pretend  

269
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,280
to be my parents? Look what that woman 
did to my face! She can't be my mother!'

270
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,840
'Most murders happen in the family, you know. Your 
family are the people who can give you most pain.  

271
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,160
They know how to hurt you. Parents are the worst.'

272
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,480
'Then why are you trying to hurt me?' asked Tug.

273
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,520
'Trying to hurt you? No, Philip, 
we're doing our best for you.  

274
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,040
But we're prisoners of the family 
ourselves. Like the rest of the world.'

275
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,240
And he smiled as he picked up his gun again.
 
 

276
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,640
11.00 A.M.
Jinny was still  

277
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,520
running when she reached the village. I must 
tell Keith what's happening at the cottage!  

278
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
I know he'll listen to me! Keith 
was Rachel Hollins' brother,  

279
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,800
and Jinny's best friend in the village, 
although he was five years older than her.

280
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,240
She found him in the Hollins' sitting-room, with 
a lot of different newspapers in front of him.

281
00:25:51,280 --> 00:26:02,280
'Keith!' she cried. 'I've got to tell you! It was 
so awful! I didn't do anything wrong but he -'

282
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,960
She began to cry as she started speaking.  

283
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,840
But Keith always took care of 
her. He gave her his cup of tea.

284
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,440
'Now, drink that, Jinny,' he told her.  

285
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,240
'You'll feel better in a moment. 
Then tell me all about it.'

286
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,840
She told him about the people at the cottage, 
and explained how the Hare-woman had told lies  

287
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,640
in Mrs Hollins' shop. 'So I went to 
the cottage to see,' she continued.  

288
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,280
'And I slid down the hill behind the 
house - and there was an awful man  

289
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,840
who told me to go away. But the really 
important thing is what I heard!'

290
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,000
'Tell me quickly, or I'll die of excitement.' 
Keith was laughing quietly to himself.

291
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:52,320
'Listen,' she said angrily. 'It's serious. 
I heard someone shouting "Help!" And the  

292
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,160
person who shouted meant it. 
Now what do you think, Keith?'

293
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,880
'Well,' said Keith, after thinking for a moment. 
'Perhaps someone was just playing a game.'

294
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:11,680
'A game! No! There was hammering - and she told 
lies - and I heard the shout! These are facts!'

295
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,480
'These newspapers have all got facts in,' said 
Keith. 'But they make different stories out of  

296
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,160
the same facts. That's my school work for the 
summer - to take a story and follow it in all  

297
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,040
the newspapers for a week, to see how different 
the stories are, although the facts are the same.  

298
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,000
Can you think of a story that I could follow?'

299
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,400
Jinny remembered the Hare-woman in the shop, 
listening to the radio. 'You could do the story  

300
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,720
of Harriet Shakespeare's son, you know, held by 
terrorists. But Keith, you're forgetting my story!  

301
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,360
What about the voice that 
shouted "Help!"? What can I do?'

302
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,120
'I agree it is a bit strange. But 
there's probably a good reason for it.  

303
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,840
If you find some more facts, I'll 
ask my father to investigate it.  

304
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,760
But now I really must start reading 
these newspapers. Sorry I can't help.'

305
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,320
I'll investigate it myself, 
thought Jinny crossly.
 
 

306
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,840
DAY FOUR - WEDNESDAY 10TH AUGUST
11.00 A.M.

307
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,960
Tug felt terrible. The music had given 
him a headache. He was alone for a moment,  

308
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,800
while Doyle and the Woman were downstairs. He 
looked tiredly round the room, at the cupboard,  

309
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,360
the walls, the wallpaper ... An idea suddenly 
came to him. I'll tear a piece of paper off  

310
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,560
the wall behind the cupboard, nobody will 
notice... He pulled at a corner of the paper.  

311
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,480
Hurry, hurry! One of Them will be back soon. 
Now he had a large piece of paper in his hand.  

312
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,240
With the pencil that he always kept in his 
pocket, he wrote a few words quickly on the paper.  

313
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,280
Then, with his hands shaking, he folded 
the paper into the shape of a dart.  

314
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,720
Hurry, hurry! He jumped on to the bed, pushed his 
arm through the bars, and threw the dart as far  

315
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,800
as possible out of the open window. That's your 
only chance to get a message to the outside world,  

316
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,480
he told himself. I hope that 
someone finds it soon!
 
 
 
 

317
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,400
CHAPTER THREE

318
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
FREE PEOPLE

319
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,800
DAY FIVE - THURSDAY 11TH AUGUST

320
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
6.30 A.M.

321
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,680
As Jinny did her work on the farm, she could not 
stop thinking about the mystery of the Hare-woman  

322
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,560
and her son. She was hoping to go back to the 
cottage today. But at breakfast her father said,  

323
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,560
'You'll have to make the butter today, Jinny, 
because your mother is making the bread.  

324
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,360
Oz,' he said to Jinny's young brother, 
'you're coming to help me mend the walls  

325
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,080
round the south field. And Jinny, you'll 
have to plant the vegetables as well.  

326
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,840
I think you'll have time. There's a 
lot to do before harvest next week.'

327
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,000
Thanks a lot! Jinny thought angrily. Don't I 
get any time for myself? It's always the same!

328
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,800
Later she talked to her mother, Bella, about it.

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,360
'Mum, why do I have to spend all my time 
working on the farm? It's the summer holidays  

330
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,840
now. My school friends all get up late 
and go riding. Or shopping, like Rachel.'

331
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,480
'Jinny, you know why we decided 
to leave London and buy this farm.  

332
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,560
Joe was working much too hard in London. His 
work was making him ill. We wanted a healthier,  

333
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,040
freer life. I agree that it's hard 
work, but we chose this life.'

334
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,680
'You two chose it, you mean. No one asked me.'

335
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,320
'All children get the life 
that their parents have chosen.  

336
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
You can choose your own life 
when you're old enough.'

337
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,440
'But I want some time now! 
I'm - I'm so angry with Dad!  

338
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,320
He gives me too much work to do. 
Sometimes I - I almost want to kill him!'

339
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,920
Her mother did not reply immediately. Then she 
said quietly, 'It's because you love him that  

340
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:16,640
you want to kill him. But it's the wrong answer. 
If you kill the people who you love, or run away  

341
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,560
from them, you only destroy yourself in the end. 
You have to accept them, or change yourself.'

342
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Suddenly Jinny realized that it was 
true. Accepting what other people wanted,  

343
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,040
and working together - that was family 
life. She smiled at her mother.
 
 

344
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
5.30 P.M.
Doyle looked at his watch.  

345
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,080
'Time to go downstairs.'

346
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:49,280
'What?' said Tug. He had been there for almost 
five days now. Was it possible to leave the room?

347
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,440
Doyle pushed him towards the door, and they 
went down the stairs. At the same moment  

348
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,480
Doyle turned off the music. For the last 
two days it had not stopped for a second.  

349
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,880
Now, the house was suddenly 
silent, and Tug felt frightened.

350
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,760
They were in a big sitting-room, full of old heavy 
furniture. The Woman was sitting in an armchair.

351
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,120
'Sit down,' she said to Tug. 'We're going to have 
a nice family evening in front of the television.'

352
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,840
Clearly, Tug's visit downstairs was planned. 
The television news was just starting.

353
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,120
Of course! thought Tug. I'll be in the news!

354
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,640
'Good evening. The terrorists who 
are holding thirteen-year-old Liam  

355
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,320
Shakespeare at his home in London have 
said that they belong to "Free People".  

356
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,560
That is the revolutionary group 
which wants to end family life.  

357
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,760
They say that they want all children and adults 
to live free from the prison of the family.'

358
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,680
What's happening? thought Tug. Am I 
crazy? How can I be here and in London?

359
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,200
'Our reporter spoke to Liam's mother, Harriet 
Shakespeare, at a friend's house today.'

360
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,840
There was Hank. Her small face looked tired, and 
Tug could see that she was trying not to cry.  

361
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,760
Hank, Hank, come and save me from these people!

362
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,280
'Mrs Shakespeare, have you spoken 
to your son?' asked the reporter.

363
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,400
'No,' replied Hank. 'But we can see him moving 
around in the house, so we know he's still alive.'

364
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,600
'Why do you think this group has taken your son?'

365
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,320
'Well, I suppose that it's because I've 
investigated Free People in the past.  

366
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,160
It's my job to investigate revolutionary groups.'

367
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,720
'You have always said that nobody should 
give terrorist groups what they want.  

368
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,640
Do you still think that, now 
that your own son is in danger?'

369
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,160
'Yes, I do. But we - we don't know yet what 
the group wants. We'll have to wait and see.'

370
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:02,480
That's a lie! Tug thought. He always knew 
when Hank was lying. But she seemed to  

371
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,520
believe that he was held by terrorists in 
London. And the reporters believed it too.

372
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,800
Doyle and the Woman were watching him carefully.

373
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,720
'It's interesting to hear about your 
friend Liam, isn't it?' Doyle said slowly.

374
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,320
'He isn't my friend-' began Tug. Then 
he stopped. He remembered Hank saying,  

375
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,840
We can see him moving around. Suddenly he 
felt very tired. Who am I? Where's home?  

376
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,280
In the bedroom, with the music, 
he would feel better. He stood up.

377
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,760
'I want to go back upstairs.'

378
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,800
Doyle put an arm round Tug, and led 
him upstairs like a small child.
 
 

379
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,840
8.00 P.M. 

380
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,000
Keith was very excited about 
the Liam Shakespeare story.

381
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,400
'Don't you think it's strange?' he asked Jinny.

382
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,760
'What do you mean?' she answered. She was 
very tired after a long day on the farm.

383
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,640
'Well, I've just shown you all the newspapers 
and the video of the six o'clock news. There's  

384
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,720
Harriet Shakespeare, a brave, loving mother, 
worried about her son. A picture of mother-love  

385
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,680
and happy families. But it's the wrong picture, 
isn't it? The terrorists have made a bad mistake.'

386
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Jinny was too tired to think clearly.  

387
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,000
'What do they care? They just want 
money or something, don't they?'

388
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,480
'Don't you understand? Terrorists aren't strong 
enough to change the world by themselves.  

389
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,960
So they try to make pictures that will change 
people's ideas. The Free People group want  

390
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,560
publicity. And in this Shakespeare story, they're 
making a picture that says Mothers are wonderful.  

391
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,120
But they don't want to say that. They want to 
say Destroy family life, because it's bad for  

392
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,960
you. Their message to the world here' - he picked 
up one of the papers - 'is that everybody - women,  

393
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,240
men, and children - should escape from the prison 
of the family. So why are they giving us the  

394
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,640
wrong message? Yes, it's a very interesting 
story, Jinny! What's going to happen?'
 
 

395
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,680
DAY SIX - FRIDAY 12TH AUGUST
2.00 A.M. 

396
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,280
Tug woke up suddenly from a bad 
dream. The room was very dark,  

397
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,840
and a large shadow was standing over his 
bed. Tug screamed. A hand covered his mouth.

398
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,560
'Quiet,' said a voice, very softly. 
'Daddy's going to tell you a bedtime story.  

399
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,880
When I was a small boy, I used 
to wake up in the night and cry.  

400
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,680
Because I was afraid of the dark, you 
see. Like you. Crying in the dark.'

401
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,280
Tug wanted to say, I wasn't crying. 
But he was too frightened to speak.  

402
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,160
Doyle went on. 'And when I started crying, my 
Daddy used to come. And he always used to hit me.  

403
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
So I learnt never, never to cry in the 
dark, because my Daddy didn't like it.  

404
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,520
And you know, I've inherited that from my 
father. I don't like my son crying in the dark.'

405
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,320
Tug was suddenly very angry. 'But I 
haven't inherited anything from you!  

406
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,280
You're not my father!'

407
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,440
Doyle did not seem to hear. 'That's the worst 
thing about families. Because my father hit me,  

408
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,600
I'll hit you, and you'll hit your 
children. This will go on and on -'

409
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,800
'No! No!' shouted Tug. 'You're not my father!'

410
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:50,800
Suddenly the light went on, and the Woman stood at 
the door. 'What's happening?' she asked angrily.

411
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,880
'I'm just telling him a little story 
about family life.' Doyle smiled slowly.

412
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,320
The Woman looked at Tug's white, frightened 
face. 'Come downstairs with me,' she said.  

413
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
'I'll make you a hot drink.'

414
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,040
In the kitchen Tug said, his voice shaking, 
'I didn't - didn't know Doyle was like that.'

415
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,120
The Woman laughed. 'Doyle doesn't often get 
angry, like me. But he's a very dangerous man.'  

416
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,720
For a moment she put her warm hands round 
Tug's, and he felt like a small child again.  

417
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,360
The fear began to disappear.

418
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,840
'Ma, what's going on? I just don't understand.'

419
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,720
She put a gentle hand on his head.  

420
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,040
'I know it's difficult, but it'll be all 
right in the end. Come on now, back to bed.'

421
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,280
When he was in bed again, Tug suddenly 
realized a terrible thing. I called her  

422
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,160
Ma. And it was worse than that. In the kitchen he 
had actually felt that she was kind and loving,  

423
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,440
and could be his mother. Was he Philip? Or 
Liam? And hadn't anyone found his message?
 
 

424
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,840
6.30 P.M.
Jinny and her brother  

425
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,880
Oz were sitting in the Hollins' sitting- room. 
On the table in front of them was the dart that  

426
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,280
Tug had thrown out of the window. Keith and Mr 
Hollins were listening to Jinny's excited story.

427
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,120
'You see, Mr Hollins, Oz and I were picking 
mushrooms up on the moors near the cottage.  

428
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,800
We were - well, we were interested in the visitors 
there, so we hid in the trees near their garden.  

429
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,480
We couldn't see anything, so we were just leaving 
when Oz found this piece of paper on the grass!  

430
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,960
Look! It says, HELP I AM A PRISONER HERE.'

431
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,920
'I can read, Jinny,' said Mr Hollins, smiling. 
'Well, what do you want me to do about it?'

432
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,880
'She wants you to go and investigate,  

433
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,440
Dad,' said Keith. 'There's something 
very strange about those visitors.'

434
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,280
'All right then,' said the policeman. 'You 
come with me, Jinny. We'll take the police car,  

435
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,720
drive to the cottage and just ask a few 
questions. Oz and Keith can stay here.'

436
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,280
When they arrived at the cottage,  

437
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,600
the Hare-woman opened the door. 
She did not seem surprised at all.

438
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,920
'Good evening, Mrs Doyle,' said Mr 
Hollins. 'Could we come in for a moment?'

439
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,960
'Of course.' They went straight into the 
sitting-room. There were books, maps and a  

440
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,240
camera on the table. A family on holiday, thought 
Jinny. There was the man with the cold blue eyes,  

441
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,880
and sitting next to him, a boy with black 
hair and very serious ice-blue eyes.

442
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,200
'This is my husband,' said the Hare-woman, 'and 
my son Philip.' They look so alike! thought Jinny.

443
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,560
Mr Hollins was talking about a lost dog.  

444
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,560
'We think that perhaps it came 
up here on the moors,' he said.

445
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
'There's no dog here,' smiled the man.  

446
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,120
'But would you like to look round 
the house while you're here?'

447
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,840
'Good idea,' said Mr Hollins. 'Thank you.'

448
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,800
'I'll come with you,' said the 
Hare-woman. They went upstairs.

449
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,720
Jinny looked at the boy. He was staring 
at her, and his face was very white.

450
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
'Talk to the girl, Philip,' said his father.

451
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,280
The boy's voice sounded strangely polite. He 
was not smiling. 'Where do you live?' he asked.

452
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,960
'Outside the village, on a small farm...' Jinny 
was talking quickly, although the boy did not  

453
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,840
seem interested. And then it happened. As Mr 
Hollins and the Hare-woman came downstairs,  

454
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,600
the man's eyes looked away from Jinny and the 
boy for a moment. In that second, while Jinny  

455
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,280
was talking, the boy stared straight at her and 
made the shape of a word with his mouth. Help.

456
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,680
'We must go, Jinny,' said Mr Hollins. 'Thank 
you, Mrs Doyle. Sorry to take up your time.'

457
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,600
In the car, as they drove back to the village, 
he explained kindly to Jinny, 'Of course you  

458
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,600
couldn't know, but the boy's a bit strange. He's 
nearly fourteen, but he's like a five-year-old  

459
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,360
child really. His mother told me all about it, 
so you see, there's nothing to investigate.'
 
 

460
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,120
7.15 P.M.
Tug watched the police car drive away.  

461
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,240
He hadn't been brave enough to scream for 
help, because of the gun in Doyle's pocket.  

462
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,440
And what had the girl and the policeman seen?  

463
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:44,080
The Doyle family. But I am Tug, he said 
angrily to himself. I'm not Philip Doyle.

464
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,040
'Well, we are a happy 
family,' said Doyle, smiling.

465
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,760
'No!' cried Tug. 'It's a lie!'

466
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,840
'Of course it's a lie,' agreed the Woman. 
'The idea of the happy family is a lie.  

467
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,040
The family is a prison. We 
want people to escape from it.'

468
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,920
'I didn't mean that rubbish!' 
cried Tug. 'I meant -'

469
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,320
'Oh Tug!' she said. 'Don't you understand?'

470
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,040
Tug had been afraid of Doyle's gun, but he was 
much more afraid now. 'What did you call me?'

471
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,560
'What? Oh, I called you Tug. Don't you remember?  

472
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,760
It's the name that I called 
you when you were a baby.'

473
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,840
'No,' said Tug in a low, frightened voice. It 
had been his secret. It was what Hank called him.

474
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,520
'Look.' The Woman suddenly opened her large 
handbag and brought out an old photo. The  

475
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,640
photo was of her when she was much younger. 
In her arms she was holding a small baby.

476
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,480
'You, six weeks old,' she said, watching Tug.

477
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,400
'No!' said Tug. It can't be 
true! Suddenly he took the photo,  

478
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,440
tore it into two pieces, and 
threw them wildly on the floor.  

479
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,280
He looked up and saw that he had really 
hurt the Woman. Her face was very white.

480
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,120
That night Tug could not sleep. 
Help me, Hank, he cried to himself.  

481
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,560
But now he could not remember 
Hank's face or voice. The only  

482
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,600
face he could see was long and thin, 
with large golden eyes. Ma's face.
 
 
 
 

483
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,920
CHAPTER FOUR

484
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,480
A MESSAGE FOR HARRIET

485
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,640
DAY EIGHT - SUNDAY 14TH AUGUST

486
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,680
10.00 A.M.

487
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,480
Jinny could not forget the white, 
staring face of the boy at the cottage.  

488
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,640
She was busy all day on Saturday, but on Sunday,  

489
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,960
when her mother was cooking the hare for lunch, 
she walked down to the village to see Keith.

490
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,840
'Jinny, the terrorists who're holding Liam 
Shakespeare have said what they want!'  

491
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,000
he said excitedly.

492
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,200
'Who? Oh, him! But I want to talk to you about-'

493
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,640
'No, listen, this is important. They want 
special children's homes all over the country,  

494
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,920
where all children under sixteen 
can live away from their families.'

495
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,440
'That's crazy,' said Jinny. 'The 
Government will never agree to that.'

496
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,600
'No, of course not. But it's giving Free 
People some publicity for their ideas,  

497
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,560
isn't it? And they say that they'll shoot 
Liam if the Government don't agree by Friday.'

498
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,720
'Poor Harriet Shakespeare! If the terrorists 
are asking for something impossible,  

499
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,960
there's nothing she can do to help 
Liam. She must be so frightened!'

500
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,480
'That's the strange thing! She isn't! Last 
night, when I watched her on the news,  

501
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,120
she looked very calm! And guess what? She 
said, "I'm sure I can get Liam out by Friday!"  

502
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,840
She really did sound sure about 
it. Here she is on the video.'

503
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,960
On the television Jinny saw Harriet 
Shakespeare's small white face  

504
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,000
and very serious ice-blue eyes... ice-blue eyes...

505
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,560
'Show me the video again!' Jinny said quickly.

506
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:21,680
'Why?' asked Keith, but Jinny did not answer. 
They watched the video again. It must be him!  

507
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,080
thought Jinny. But what will happen if I'm right?

508
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:34,160
'Have you got a photo of Liam, from a newspaper?' 
she asked. It's impossible, she was thinking.

509
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,040
The photo that Keith held out to her showed 
the face of the boy who was in the cottage.  

510
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,480
But in the photo his hair was fair, not black.  

511
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,600
She picked up a pencil, and carefully 
changed the colour of his hair to black.

512
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,080
'What are you doing?' asked Keith at last.

513
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,400
Jinny showed him the photo, her 
hands shaking with excitement.  

514
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,280
'Liam Shakespeare isn't in that London house. 
He's here in Derbyshire, in your Mum's cottage!'
 
 

515
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,360
10.45 A.M.
Tug's room was quiet now, because the music  

516
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,960
had stopped. He was alone with the questions in 
his head, the questions that he could not answer.

517
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,000
Doyle, the Woman, the television reporters, Hank, 
the girl, the policeman, and his own face in the  

518
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,560
mirror all told him that he was Philip Doyle, and 
that Liam Shakespeare was in a house in London.  

519
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,880
So did he really believe that they 
were all wrong and he was right?

520
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,520
Was the rest of the world crazy? Or was he crazy?

521
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,200
Just then he heard the church bells from the 
village, and realized that it must be Sunday.  

522
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,720
Last time he had heard them 
was when he was running...

523
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,160
Yes! Last Sunday I went for a run. Hank 
was going to cook me a special meal...

524
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,880
No! Last Sunday Doyle and Ma 
drove me here. We're on holiday...

525
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,840
How could he be sure which really happened? If I 
can remember things about myself which are true,  

526
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:11,680
I can build up a picture of the real 
me. He liked running. He hated bananas.  

527
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,480
He could make a cake. He could mend 
bicycles. He could speak some French...

528
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,160
An hour later, he was still remembering things,  

529
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,040
when the Woman came to say that 
lunch was ready downstairs.

530
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,000
When they arrived in the sitting-room, Tug 
was surprised to see that they were going to  

531
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,320
have a family Sunday lunch. On the big table 
there were knives, forks, plates and glasses,  

532
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,920
and in the centre there was a large roast 
chicken with a lot of different vegetables.

533
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,480
But Doyle did not sit down. 'Oh, very nice!'  

534
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,840
he said, with a cold smile. 
'What a lovely family meal!'

535
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:59,120
The Woman stared at him angrily. 'Don't be 
stupid! What does it matter? It's only a meal!'

536
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:06,960
'Nothing is only itself. Everything means 
something. And Sunday lunch means family life.  

537
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,440
We're against that, remember?' He turned to Tug.  

538
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:19,760
'Don't look surprised, Philip. Families often 
argue during Sunday lunch. My parents used to  

539
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,560
argue all Sunday afternoon, and then Dad 
used to hit us children, again and again.'

540
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,320
'We don't want to hear about 
your past,' said the Woman.

541
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,200
Doyle looked coldly at her. 'It's better than 
hearing about your past, about a mother and baby.'

542
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,520
The Woman hit Doyle hard in the mouth. 
But before Doyle could do or say anything,  

543
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
Tug said quickly, 'Ma, I'm hungry.'

544
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,920
Doyle looked at Tug almost sadly. 'Children 
don't like it when their parents argue,' he said.

545
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,320
The Woman laughed and sat down. 'Come on,  

546
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,200
let's eat the chicken. After 
that we're having baked bananas.'

547
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:06,160
'Oh Ma!' cried Tug without thinking. 
'You know I hate bananas. I'll be sick!'

548
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,840
'Of course I haven't forgotten,' she 
replied. 'There's an apple for you.'
 
 

549
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,720
1.00 P.M.
'Mr Hollins, please believe me!' cried Jinny.

550
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,320
'I'm sorry, Jinny,' said the policeman kindly.  

551
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,320
'Everybody knows that Liam Shakespeare's 
in London. How can he be in our cottage?  

552
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,880
Now I'm going to have my lunch, so 
you go home and forget about it.'

553
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,240
Jinny and Keith walked out of the Hollins' house.

554
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,720
'We must do something!' said Jinny miserably.  

555
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,400
'I'm really sure that it's Liam 
Shakespeare in the cottage.'

556
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,120
'And Harriet Shakespeare sounded strange on 
the television news, didn't she?' said Keith.  

557
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,080
'Why was she so sure that Liam would be safe on 
Friday? Perhaps she knows that he's not in London.  

558
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,120
Listen, I've got an idea. We 
could send a message to her.  

559
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,840
It says in the newspaper that she's 
staying with a friend, Lucy Mallory.  

560
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,480
Well, if we can find Lucy Mallory's 
phone number, we can phone her.'

561
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,720
'How can we find her number?'

562
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,840
'Well, they've got a London street map 
and a London phone book at the library.  

563
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,600
I'll go there tomorrow and find the phone 
number. Can you meet me tomorrow evening?  

564
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,840
We'll phone Lucy Mallory together, 
from the village phone box.'

565
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,160
'All right. Shall we say - about 10 o'clock?'
 
 

566
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,920
DAY NINE - MONDAY 15TH AUGUST
4.00 P.M. 

567
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,840
This time the Woman was sitting 
at the door of Tug's room.  

568
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,120
She kept her own gun by the side of her chair.

569
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,240
'Why was Doyle so angry yesterday, Ma?' Tug asked.

570
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,920
'Oh, you know what he's like. He wants people 
to understand. For years he hated his father.  

571
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,840
He believed that he was bad, 
because his father hated him.  

572
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,280
Then one day he understood. It was 
the happiest moment of his life.'

573
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:19,600
Did Doyle ever have happy moments? Impossible! 
thought Tug. 'What had he understood?' he asked.

574
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,400
'That it isn't natural for people to 
stay in families for years and years.  

575
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:32,320
People stop loving and start hating. That's 
what happened to me. That's why I -' She stopped  

576
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,160
suddenly, then started again. 'Governments and 
big business want people to live in families,  

577
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,040
because if you've got a family, you've got 
something to lose. You don't want to fight  

578
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:49,600
against the government. We've got to show people 
how to be free! Free to live and free to fight!'

579
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,200
She looked wonderfully tall and strong and 
brave, as she stood in the centre of the room  

580
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,720
and waved her arms. Tug wanted to jump up and join 
her. But a small voice inside his head was saying,  

581
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,360
If a speaker excites you, be very 
careful. Forget the excitement,  

582
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:13,840
and think hard about the ideas. It was 
Hank's voice. Hank was right, of course.

583
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:21,200
Then something terrible happened. He thought, 
Is Hank real? He knew that Harriet Shakespeare  

584
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,840
was real because he had seen her on television. 
But was she really his mother? Perhaps Hank was  

585
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,000
only an idea, a wish - the kind of mother 
that he would like to have, instead of Ma.  

586
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,200
Perhaps he was living in a 
dream world. Crazy Philip Doyle.

587
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,320
He was shaking and could not speak. The Woman 
noticed, and came over to put her arms round him.

588
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,800
'What's the matter, Tug? Everything'll 
be all right. After tomorrow.'

589
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,560
Just then Doyle entered the room, 
with a tray. 'What's happening?'  

590
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,160
he asked the Woman coldly. 'What a 
wonderful picture of motherly love!'

591
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,040
'I was just being a little bit kind...'

592
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,400
'And what about the gun? It's on 
the bed, where Philip can reach it.'  

593
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,080
He picked it up. 'That's dangerous.' He stared 
at the Woman - a long, cold, hard stare.  

594
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,080
After a minute she turned 
away, and went out of the room.

595
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,560
Doyle gave the tray to Tug. 'Here's your supper.'

596
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,160
'Thanks,' Tug said. He took the tray 
with hands that were still shaking.

597
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,840
'Thanks - what?'

598
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,960
'Oh.' He had forgotten. 'Thanks, Doyle.'
 
 

599
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,200
9.50 P.M. 

600
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
Jinny hurried down the road to the village, 
and saw Keith waiting by the phone box.

601
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,160
'Come on,' he said excitedly. 
'I've got the number.'

602
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:59,360
The phone rang and rang. At last a voice 
answered. 'What number do you want? Who  

603
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,920
do you want to speak to? What is your 
name? What number are you calling from?'

604
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,880
Jinny answered all these questions. Then 
she asked Keith, 'What's happening?'

605
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,240
'The police are checking all phone calls to 
Mrs Shakespeare or her friends, I think.'

606
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,640
Then another voice. 'Lucy Mallory here.'

607
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,880
'Please,' said Jinny hurriedly, 'I want to 
speak to Harriet Shakespeare. It's important.  

608
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,800
It's about Liam.'

609
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,840
'Wait a moment.' The woman did not sound friendly.

610
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,000
Then another voice spoke,  

611
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,880
the deep voice that Jinny and Keith had 
heard on the television news. 'Yes?'

612
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,640
'You - you're Harriet Shakespeare?' asked Jinny, 
not sure what to say. 'I - I know where Liam is.'

613
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,360
'Everyone knows where Liam 
is.' The voice was hard.

614
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:01,840
'But he's not in your house. He's a prisoner, 
in my village. I've seen him. He's...'

615
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,080
'Listen!' Harriet Shakespeare said angrily.  

616
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,520
'You're the fourteenth person who's phoned me 
at Lucy's to tell me crazy stories about Liam!'

617
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,560
'But you must believe me! The police up here 
won't believe me, and we thought, when we saw  

618
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,080
you on television, that you knew something, 
something that you weren't telling anybody -'

619
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:30,240
'Oh yes? And what do I know?' Suddenly 
her voice was very quiet, and worried.

620
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,480
'That the terrorists are only 
pretending to hold Liam in your house.  

621
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,280
That really he's in a different place.'

622
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:46,400
'Oh.' She sounded almost thankful, Jinny thought. 
Then the voice became angry again. 'Well,  

623
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:53,200
you're wrong about that. Now please just forget 
it, and don't ring me again.' The phone went dead.

624
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,960
'Well,' said Jinny unhappily, 'we 
were wrong. She didn't know anything.  

625
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,200
She didn't believe me. And she was awful'

626
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,840
'Never mind, Jinny,' said Keith slowly. 'I 
agree, we were wrong about what she knew.  

627
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,720
But I'm sure that she was hiding 
something. What could it be?'
 
 
 
 

628
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,640
CHAPTER FIVE

629
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,400
ON THE EDGE

630
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,040
DAY TEN - TUESDAY 16TH AUGUST

631
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,000
2.55 A.M.

632
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,600
'Tug!' The Woman was trying to wake him. 'Tug!'

633
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,720
'Ma? What time is it? What's the matter?'

634
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,520
She spoke quietly into his ear.  

635
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,520
'Don't speak so loudly, or you'll wake 
Doyle. The news is on in a moment.'

636
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,320
'In the middle of the night?' But Tug took the 
small radio from her and put it near his ear.

637
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:57,680
'Good morning. This is the news. Police have 
arrested the terrorists who said that they were  

638
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:03,200
holding Liam Shakespeare at his home in London. 
But when the police entered the house just before  

639
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,520
midnight, Liam himself was not there. One of 
the group is a boy of fifteen, with fair hair,  

640
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,040
who looks like Liam. It is not known why the 
terrorists were pretending to hold Liam prisoner.  

641
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,480
The police are continuing 
to investigate the matter.'

642
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,400
'I don't understand,' said Tug, still half asleep.

643
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:30,160
She held his hand. 'You're all right. We just 
have to wait, wait until the end of today.'

644
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,360
Today. Tuesday. 'Aren't you going to tell me -'

645
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,200
'No! Go to sleep now!'

646
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,240
But he could not sleep. He had 
so many things to think about.  

647
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,160
Liam Shakespeare had disappeared. So who was Tug?  

648
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:56,960
He tried to remember the facts that he knew about 
himself. He liked running. He hated bananas...
 
 

649
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,320
6.45 A.M. 

650
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,520
Jinny was getting breakfast ready. She 
hadn't slept all night. She knew that she  

651
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,240
was right about the boy in the cottage. But today 
I won't have time to worry about it! she thought,  

652
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,680
because it's our harvest day, the busiest day of 
the year. All the neighbours were coming to help.

653
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:27,680
Just then she noticed a car coming up the narrow 
road to the farm. A visitor! On harvest day!  

654
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:35,120
It was a woman, dressed in an expensive suit, and 
wearing sunglasses. Jinny went out to meet her.

655
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,080
'You're Jinny Slattery,' the woman said.  

656
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,720
Jinny recognized the deep voice that 
she had heard on the phone last night.  

657
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,800
'You gave your name and the number of the village 
phone box, luckily. That's how I found you. I've  

658
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,360
driven all the way from London, and the girl in 
the post office told me where your farm was.'

659
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,000
'But why have you come?' asked Jinny. 
'You didn't believe me last night!'

660
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:09,120
'Haven't you heard the news? Liam isn't 
at our home in London. I came to find you  

661
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:15,520
because you're the only person who seems to know 
where he is. You're my only hope! Where is he?  

662
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,920
How can I get him out?' She sounded desperate.

663
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,360
'Look, I can show you the house where he is, but-'

664
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:31,120
'We must hurry! There isn't much time! We've 
got to get him out by 2 o'clock today!'
 
 

665
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,040
7.15 A.M.
Tug knew that today was different from other days.  

666
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,560
At breakfast, both Doyle and the Woman kept 
their guns on the table by their hands,  

667
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,520
ready for - what? Tug felt afraid.

668
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,520
Doyle stared coldly at Tug. 'Suppose 
that this is the last day of your life.  

669
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,000
What would you like to do most?'

670
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,600
'Doyle!' said the Woman angrily, 
and put her hand on Tug's arm.

671
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,080
Doyle continued. 'If you don't know what you'd 
choose to do on the last day of your life,  

672
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,000
you don't know what's really important to you.  

673
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,400
Forget about parents and other people. Only 
free people know the answer to that question.'

674
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,720
'It's not easy to know what 
you want,' agreed the Woman.  

675
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,760
'Because you need to know who you really are. 
Nothing to do with your family. Just you.'

676
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:33,280
'You think you're Liam Shakespeare,' Doyle went 
on. 'We say you're Philip Doyle. Without one of  

677
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:40,080
those names, you're nobody. And you can't answer 
my question, can you? You don't know who you are!'

678
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,960
They were both staring at him, with their wild, 
crazy eyes. Why should I play their games?  

679
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,200
thought Tug. I'm Tug, I like 
running. I hate bananas...

680
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
'Yes, I do know who I am,' he said.

681
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,000
Doyle seemed surprised. 'Well?'  

682
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,840
he said. 'If you're so sure, what would 
you do on the last day of your life?'

683
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,080
Tug thought for a moment. He stared out of 
the window at the great rocky ridge which  

684
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,200
stood high against the sky. It looked black 
and frightening in the early morning light.

685
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,360
'What's that long hill called?' he asked.

686
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,720
Doyle smiled. He thought that Tug 
could not answer his question.  

687
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,920
'That's Ashdale Great Edge. And the rock 
at the end is called the Castle Rock.'

688
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:39,440
'I can tell you what I'd do on the last 
day of my life,' Tug said calmly. 'I'd run,  

689
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,120
all the way along Ashdale Great 
Edge, from this end to Castle Rock.'

690
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,840
'That's a stupid thing to do!' said Doyle.

691
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,920
But I know that's what I want, and 
nobody can take that away from me,  

692
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,800
thought Tug. Then he noticed the Woman looking 
very sadly at him. He had to ask her the question.

693
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,160
'So - is this going to be 
the last day of my life?'

694
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,360
'I think perhaps - not,' Doyle answered.  

695
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,760
'It will be the last day of someone's 
life, but not yours, I think.'
 
 

696
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,000
7.35 A.M.
Around the  

697
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,200
breakfast table sat Jinny, Oz, their parents, 
Harriet, and Keith, who had just arrived.

698
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,520
'So, Mrs Shakespeare,' said Joe Slattery, 'you 
think that your son is staying in the cottage  

699
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,640
with people who are probably terrorists. You 
don't want to go to the police because it'll  

700
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,480
take too much time. And you want us to think of 
a plan to save your son before two o'clock today.  

701
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,480
On harvest day, the most 
important day of the year for us.'

702
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,520
Harriet stared desperately 
at Joe. 'Yes,' she said.

703
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:52,400
Joe thought for a moment. 'Well, Keith here says 
that one of the Doyles goes to the post office to  

704
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,440
get a newspaper every day. That'll give us about 
twenty minutes. We can send Jinny to the cottage.  

705
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,160
She goes inside, with some excuse or other. 
Then I'll come up with some of the neighbours,  

706
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,840
we'll knock on the door, and pull out the person 
who comes to the door. That way, neither of the  

707
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,720
Doyles will get a chance to use a gun, and 
we can get both Liam and Jinny out safely.'

708
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,440
Nobody spoke for a second. Then Harriet said,  

709
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,800
'Yes, it's a good plan. All 
right, shall we go?' and got up.

710
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,240
'Wait,' said Joe suddenly. 'Now I have a question. 
Why? You want me to forget about my harvest and  

711
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:42,400
put my daughter in danger. But why today? 
The television reporters are saying that the  

712
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:49,200
terrorists won't hurt Liam until Friday. That's 
what Keith says. So we don't need to hurry.'

713
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,320
'I've told you, if the terrorists don't 
get what they want by two o'clock today,  

714
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,840
Liam will die.' Harriet stared angrily at Joe.

715
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,360
Keith suddenly said, 'I don't think they're really 
interested in those special homes for children.  

716
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,320
I think they want something more important.'

717
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:15,040
'You're right,' said Harriet tiredly. 'They've got 
publicity for their ideas now, of course. But - I  

718
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,920
see that I'll have to tell you what they really 
want. They want to do something that people will  

719
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,760
remember for a long time. They want to destroy, 
to bomb the most famous family in the country.'

720
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,720
'You mean -' said Bella 
Slattery. 'But that's impossible.  

721
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,840
The royal family always have police and 
detectives around them, don't they?'

722
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:42,000
'You only need one terrorist with a bomb, 
in the right crowd at the right time. At two  

723
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,440
o'clock this afternoon,' replied Harriet. 
'I was investigating Free People, you see.  

724
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,800
And when I discovered their plan, they 
took Liam, to stop me warning the police.  

725
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,640
It's difficult for me, isn't it? If 
I warn the police, Free People will  

726
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,840
kill Liam - and say that he died because his 
mother, his family, chose not to save him.  

727
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,960
But if I don't warn the police, there will be 
several deaths in another, more famous family.  

728
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,080
And Free People will say that they died because 
of my love for my son, my family. Either way,  

729
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,080
Free People win the game, because the 
idea of the family gets bad publicity.'

730
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,760
She put her head in her hands and sat very still.

731
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,440
Joe stood up. 'I understand now. We'll help you.'

732
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,120
'But -' said Keith miserably, 'shouldn't we 
tell the police about the bomb before we start?'

733
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,320
'Yes,' said Harriet. She was 
finding it difficult to speak.  

734
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,080
'I decided yesterday to warn the 
police. So the royal family are  

735
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,800
safe. But Liam will be dead after two 
o'clock, if we don't get him out.'
 
 

736
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,240
11.00 A.M.
Doyle had gone out and Tug was washing  

737
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,840
the breakfast dishes when there was a knock on the 
door. The Woman hid the guns and opened the door.  

738
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,040
It was the girl who had come with the policeman.

739
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,640
'Hallo, Mrs Doyle,' the girl said politely.  

740
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,440
'We just wanted to invite you to our harvest 
party this evening. It's very good fun -' She  

741
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,040
saw Tug in the kitchen and ran through the 
sitting-room to him. 'Do come, Philip.'

742
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,240
Just then they heard Doyle's car coming very fast 
up the road. Tug saw sudden fear in the girl's  

743
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:34,160
face. The car door banged, and Doyle hurried 
into the house, shouting orders at the Woman.

744
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,320
'Come on! We've got to leave! 
Harriet Shakespeare's in the village!  

745
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,120
I met that stupid little girl from 
the post office just down the road,  

746
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,920
and she told me! Bring the boy! And 
that girl! And the guns and the radio!'

747
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,680
In a few moments they were all in the car, 
driving fast down the road away from the cottage.

748
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,840
'So what's your plan, Doyle?' asked the Woman. She 
had her gun in her hand, and was ready to shoot.

749
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,000
'You'll see. We're going somewhere safe 
for the next two or three hours - Oh no!'

750
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:18,800
There were four men walking along the road towards 
them. Doyle drove faster, straight at them,  

751
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,840
and at the last moment the men jumped to one 
side, shouting and banging on the roof of the car.  

752
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,400
The next minute the car turned away 
from the village, and up to the moors.

753
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,280
The car finally stopped high up above 
the valley. 'Get out!' ordered Doyle.  

754
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,600
'Start walking!' They walked up the long ridge 
that Tug had seen from the kitchen window.  

755
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,960
The wind was strong and cold, and they could 
see a long way on both sides of the ridge.

756
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:55,680
'Stop here!' shouted Doyle. Now we wait for 
visitors!' They did not have to wait long.  

757
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,560
Two cars drove fast up the hill and 
stopped a few hundred metres away.  

758
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,080
Tug saw the men who had been on the road, 
with a boy who was older than him, and - Hank.

759
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:13,040
'Stay there!' shouted Doyle to them. 
He was holding the girl by her hair,  

760
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:19,760
and slowly he put his gun to her head. 'If you 
come any nearer, I'll shoot!' Then he smiled at  

761
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:26,560
Tug and the Woman. 'Sit down, everyone,' he said. 
'We're going to wait and listen to the news.'

762
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:35,760
Why not? thought Tug. It all seemed like a dream. 
He sat on the grass, staring at the radio.
 
 

763
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,760
2.25 P.M.
This is probably the last wind  

764
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,840
that I'll ever feel, thought Jinny. When they hear 
the news, they'll know that their plan has failed.  

765
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,120
And then they'll shoot us. She could 
see the blue uniforms of policemen  

766
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:59,760
in the little group of people waiting by the 
cars. Some policemen had guns. But Doyle and  

767
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,080
the Hare-woman were very careful to keep the 
boy and Jinny in front of their own bodies.

768
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:11,680
'Right,' said Doyle. 'Now let's listen to the 
two-thirty news. We're waiting to hear of some  

769
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:17,360
important deaths. If those people haven't died, 
you'll know that Harriet Shakespeare chose to  

770
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:22,400
save their lives, not her son's. Because 
he's less important to her than they are.'

771
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:30,720
The boy's face went white. It's not true, Jinny 
wanted to say, she loves you! I've seen that!

772
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,520
They listened silently to the news. At the end,  

773
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,640
Doyle turned off the radio 
and said, 'Now, let's talk.'

774
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:46,080
'What about?' asked the boy in a high, frightened 
voice. 'You're going to kill me, aren't you?'

775
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:53,280
'Oh, yes,' said Doyle. 'We're going to kill 
you. But you can choose something first.  

776
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,360
Harriet Shakespeare can't be sure that you're Liam 
because she's too far away to see you clearly.  

777
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:07,120
And if she's not sure, you can't be sure, can 
you? So I'm going to call her over here. She's  

778
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:13,200
going to walk slowly towards us. Then we can see 
her face when she decides if you are Liam or not.'

779
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,680
'Then you'll shoot me, I suppose ?' said the boy.

780
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,520
'No, I won't. Your mother will.'

781
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,840
Jinny did not understand why the boy 
turned to stare at the Hare-woman.  

782
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,840
'Ma - would you really shoot me?' he said.

783
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:37,840
Doyle laughed. 'You don't know her very well, do 
you? She killed her own baby twelve years ago.'

784
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,320
Nobody spoke for a moment.

785
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,000
'So,' continued Doyle, 'you can wait for 
Harriet Shakespeare to decide who you are,  

786
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,640
to put you in a box with a name on 
it. Or you can choose for yourself,  

787
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,160
and spend your last moments of life how you want.'

788
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,280
'We're giving you the chance to 
choose,' added the Hare- woman,  

789
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,560
almost gently, ' - to choose who 
you really are, inside yourself.'

790
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:09,520
Tug tried to think clearly. Oh Hank! What would 
you choose? Suddenly, he could hear her voice  

791
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:18,160
in his head. Do I have to decide everything 
for you? Decide for yourself! He smiled. Of  

792
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:24,720
course she was his mother! He knew it now, 
without question. Now it was easy to decide.

793
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,800
He stood up. 'I'm ready,' he said,  

794
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,640
and began to run away from Hank, along 
the ridge towards the Castle Rock.

795
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,880
Jinny stared. Why was he running that way?  

796
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,600
she thought. But the Hare-woman was now lifting 
the gun in her hands, ready to shoot the boy.

797
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,040
'You're crazy!' screamed 
Jinny. 'Don't shoot him-!'

798
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,160
Doyle's hand suddenly 
covered her mouth. 'Hurry up,  

799
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,760
you stupid cow,' he said to the 
Hare-woman, 'or it'll be too late.'

800
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,160
And Jinny could see that the police, the farmers 
and Harriet were beginning to come nearer.  

801
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:10,720
Jinny stared at the Hare-woman. Her face looked 
desperate, like... who was it? Like Harriet  

802
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,520
Shakespeare, when she arrived at the farmhouse, 
worried about her son, because she loved him.

803
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,720
Suddenly Jinny bit Doyle's hand hard, and pulled 
her mouth away. She shouted at the Hare-woman,  

804
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,040
using the words that her 
own mother had used to her.

805
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,240
'It's because you love him 
that you want to kill him!  

806
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,840
But if you kill him, you'll 
only destroy yourself!'

807
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,320
The Hare-woman looked round, surprised. 
At that moment, there was a bang and she  

808
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:45,360
put her hand to her side. A policeman had shot 
her. Doyle ran to take her gun before she fell,  

809
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:51,040
but before he could take it, she threw it high up 
in the air. It fell over the side of the ridge.

810
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:57,440
'Run, Tug, run! You're free!' 
she called into the wind.

811
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,120
And Harriet Shakespeare, running towards them,  

812
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:05,360
cried at the same moment, 'Tug, 
it's all right! You're safe!'

813
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:12,240
Tug heard the sound of the gun, and then the 
two shouts behind him. But he did not stop,  

814
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,600
because the only thing that mattered was the 
running. His legs ached, and his feet hurt, but  

815
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,200
in front of him was the Castle Rock and he knew 
that he could reach it. And as he ran, he sang  

816
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:32,680
in his head, This is me. Here I am, Hank. Here 
I am, Ma. This is me. This is who I am.
 
 
 
 
 
 

817
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,284
- THE END -
