1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:08,850
Progress
Government offices are much the same everywhere.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:17,690
Sometimes the officials in them are good people,
helpful and kind; sometimes they are not.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:25,619
And if you need something badly, sometimes
it is necessary to give little 'presents',

4
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,509
maybe some money, which then disappears into
a back pocket.

5
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,140
These are the ways of the world.

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,910
People have been giving and taking bribes
forever.

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:01:05,070
Marina Salcedo, Senior Clerk, second grade,
hurried to her desk to open her pay envelope.

8
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:13,219
It was the fifteenth of July, and tomorrow
she was leaving for Manila, to get the promotion

9
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:18,549
that she had been promised for five years.

10
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:25,149
She had worked in the Ministry for twenty
years, and in the last five years the cost

11
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,119
of living had risen greatly.

12
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,840
Without the extra money from her promotion,
her youngest son would not be able to go to

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,570
college.

14
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:45,420
Also, three years ago they had borrowed money
on their house when her husband had had to

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,399
go to hospital.

16
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,970
She checked her pay carefully.

17
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,909
Two hundred and sixty pesos; this is what
she would take to Manila.

18
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,869
She walked down to the far end of the hall
to the Chief's office.

19
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,729
The girls there were not talking.

20
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,810
That meant the Chief was in.

21
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,329
His secretary told her to go straight in.

22
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:26,420
The Chief was reading a dirty copy of Playboy,
a magazine for men full of photos of women.

23
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,930
He did not put the magazine away, and Marina
stood in front of him, waiting for him to

24
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,920
look up.

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,359
He was about fifty, and going bald.

26
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:47,620
'So you are leaving tomorrow, Marina,' he
said.

27
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,830
'Yes, sir...'

28
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,680
'Well, you can have the afternoon off, to
get ready.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,870
You will only have three working days in Manila.

30
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,900
Do you think that will be enough?'

31
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,440
'I would like to have three more days, sir,
if possible.'

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,109
'No problem, Marina,' the Chief said.

33
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:23,390
'Oh, and when you are there, will you please
buy me the latest gabardine material for a

34
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,810
pair of pants?

35
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,299
I will pay when you get back.'

36
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,180
'Yes, sir.

37
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,060
Thank you.'

38
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,560
Gabardine material - it must cost at least
sixty pesos.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,819
Last time, the Chief wanted a pair of Levi
jeans; they had cost a hundred and twenty

40
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,430
pesos.

41
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:59,900
When she returned, they had played this little
game: he saying he must pay, she refusing

42
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,519
to take the money.

43
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:11,239
After all, he was not a bad boss - three days
off with pay, for example.

44
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:21,049
And he did not try to touch her in the way
he did with the other women clerks.

45
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:27,720
The bus left at six in the morning, driving
along the valley through the newly planted

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,410
rice fields, the water shining in the early
morning sun.

47
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:43,910
The roads were good, with strong new bridges,
making the journey to Manila only ten hours.

48
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,699
It used to take a full day.

49
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:54,729
This was progress, the kind that people could
see and enjoy.

50
00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:02,210
Marina knew there were problems in the mountain
villages and other places, but in her province

51
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,759
things were calm.

52
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
Her own life was not so bad.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,310
She and her husband had finally built a house.

54
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:22,500
Three children, one married and soon to leave
for the United States; another soon to finish

55
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,700
college; and the youngest nearly finished
high school.

56
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,080
But the cost of living had gone up.

57
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,920
They had to cook on wood fires, and could
not afford to buy toilet paper.

58
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,180
Five years ago she had asked for promotion.

59
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:54,050
She had gone to Manila twice about it, and
finally she had received a notice saying it

60
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,250
would happen.

61
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,949
The bus arrived in Manila as it was getting
dark.

62
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,800
Marina walked to the street where her second
cousin lived.

63
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,099
They had been college students together.

64
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:18,020
She would probably sleep on a hard sofa in
their living room, but that was better than

65
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:25,319
spending thirty pesos on a cheap, dirty room
somewhere.

66
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:33,310
They were having dinner when she arrived and,
like a good relation, she had brought meat,

67
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,130
fish, and rice from her province.

68
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:45,669
They seemed pleased to see her, but Marina
noticed that her cousin soon asked, 'When

69
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,699
will you leave?'

70
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:55,770
'I won't be here more than a week,' she said,
'and I won't eat here.

71
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll spend every day at the Ministry, following
up my papers.'

72
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,340
She was up at six the next day.

73
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:15,440
Her cousin's children, aged thirteen and fourteen,
were getting ready for school.

74
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,470
They had kept her awake playing rock music
in the night.

75
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,940
When she arrived at the Ministry, she went
straight to Personnel.

76
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,300
The people that she worked with years ago
in that office had all left, and there was

77
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,180
nobody she knew.

78
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,120
She asked for the person who worked on the
papers of staff promotion, and was sent to

79
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:52,680
the other end of the office, to a fat woman
in her early thirties, with bad teeth, thin

80
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,889
hair, and a uniform that was too small for
her large body.

81
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:06,020
The woman brought out a list and read through
it carefully.

82
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:16,280
Then she moved some papers around on her desk,
and looked up with a fat little smile.

83
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,639
'I am sorry, Mrs Salcedo, but your name is
not here.

84
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,789
Maybe the forms got lost...'

85
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,729
'But it cannot be,' Marina said.

86
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,450
Her voice got louder.

87
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,070
'I have the official letter from you.'

88
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,050
She quickly pulled it out of her handbag.

89
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,450
'Here... and the file number.'

90
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:51,360
The woman shook her head, and her fixed little
smile did not change.

91
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:01,800
'Mrs Salcedo,' she said sweetly, 'I will have
to look through the files, hundreds and hundreds

92
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,750
of them.

93
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,640
I will have to ask one of the boys.'

94
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,340
She opened the drawer in her desk that was
closest to Marina.

95
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:21,840
'Why don't you drop a twenty-peso bill in
here for him...?'

96
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,210
For a moment Marina Salcedo could not believe
this was happening to her.

97
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,780
She worked in the same Ministry as these people.

98
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,460
Then she remembered that Anita Botong in her
office in the province did the same thing.

99
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:50,560
It had gone on for a long time - too long
to be easy to stop.

100
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,270
She took a twenty-peso bill from her handbag,
and dropped it in the drawer.

101
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,450
'Will I come back this afternoon then?'

102
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,140
she asked.

103
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:10,100
'Oh, Mrs Salcedo,' the woman said, still smiling.

104
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,780
'You know how difficult it will be.

105
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,470
Why don't you come back early tomorrow?'

106
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,500
'I am from the province...'

107
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,790
'Yes, I know.

108
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,870
I will do all I can to help you...'

109
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,510
She had nothing more to do.

110
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,600
She left the Ministry and took a jeepney to
the market in Quiapo.

111
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,880
What was the best kind of gabardine, she asked,
and what did it cost?

112
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,100
In the end she bought the material in one
of the big department stores for thirty-four

113
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,940
pesos.

114
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,740
Then she looked round the rest of the market,
and found that food prices were higher than

115
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,680
at home.

116
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,020
So, prices in the province were not so bad
then!

117
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,800
She spent five pesos on a bowl of noodles
with chicken for lunch, then walked around

118
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,810
the city.

119
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,620
She had not been to Manila for some time,
and it had changed a lot.

120
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:37,610
In Makati, a very rich area, there were tall,
glass-sided buildings, and the streets were

121
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,440
clean.

122
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,760
It was like America.

123
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,820
She thought of her son, who would soon be
in America.

124
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,050
One day in the future she and her husband
hoped to join him there.

125
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,420
But the future was here, in Makati.

126
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:08,890
And if this was the future, was it necessary
to leave the country?

127
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:16,270
The next morning, back at the Ministry, the
fat woman had found her papers, but there

128
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,660
was a new form to complete.

129
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:28,930
Marina would have to fetch Form D22a from
another office in the building, fill it in,

130
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:36,270
and then take it to Personnel, who would sign
it and send it back to the first office.

131
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:46,480
This office was on the fifth floor, and the
lift was not working.

132
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,130
The man in the Form D22a office was very sorry.

133
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,000
'Oh, please come back tomorrow afternoon.

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,940
We have no forms here at the moment - we have
to get some more.'

135
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,120
Marina recognized the old game at once, and
was annoyed.

136
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:20,320
The top drawer in the man's desk was open,
and Marina dropped a five-peso bill into it.

137
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,730
She must remember to carry two-peso bills,
she thought.

138
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,910
'Please, I am really in a hurry,' she said.

139
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,780
'Do try and find one.

140
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,550
There must be one lying around...'

141
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:45,550
The man closed his desk drawer with a smile,
then went to an old filing cabinet behind

142
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,990
his desk.

143
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,170
It didn't take him a minute to find the form.

144
00:13:52,170 --> 00:14:01,881
The form had a lot of questions, about dates
of this and that, school and college, travel

145
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,140
abroad...

146
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,530
That made Marina laugh.

147
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,610
How many government clerks have ever traveled
abroad?

148
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,750
She hadn't even traveled around her own country.

149
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,260
Looking back over her past, she began to think
about what she wanted from life.

150
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,640
She had never wanted to climb to the top of
the tree, to become a minister.

151
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,990
Both she and her husband were happy enough
with things as they were.

152
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:45,030
After all these years, they had their own
home, a piece of land, and they could sleep

153
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:54,540
deeply at night, not worried by the kind of
bad dreams that important ministers must have.

154
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,880
She took her completed form to the Chief in
the office, who was said to be an honest man.

155
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,850
Now was the moment when she would find out
if that was true.

156
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,230
She waited and waited, and was at last called
over to the glass-topped desk where Chief

157
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,940
Bermudez was sitting.

158
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,260
'Well, what is your problem?'

159
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,000
'My promotion, sir,' Marina said.

160
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,100
'I've been waiting a long time for it.'

161
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,030
She put her papers on the desk in front of
him.

162
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,850
Chief Bermudez read them all carefully.

163
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:46,320
'Well, Mrs Salcedo, everything here seems
all right.

164
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,500
You know what to do next.

165
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:57,900
After I sign the forms, you go to Finance
to find out if there are funds to pay you.

166
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:07,790
If there are, the Minister will sign the papers
- and you will have your hundred pesos a month.

167
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:17,030
And I think your pay rise should start at
the beginning of this year, to give you those

168
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,530
extra months.

169
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,740
I will make sure that happens.'

170
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,130
He began to sign the papers.

171
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:33,340
'I know you have worked for the Ministry for
a long time.

172
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:42,250
Things happen too slowly sometimes - I should
not tell you this really - but we must be

173
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,220
patient.

174
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:52,420
We must push, and push, and push... but only
gently.'

175
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,020
He smiled.

176
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,740
'Good luck with Finance.'

177
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,300
They were now alone in the room.

178
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,030
'Is that all, sir?' said Marina.

179
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,730
'Why, is there something that I have forgotten?'

180
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,049
In her surprise, Mrs Salcedo forgot to thank
him.

181
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,149
At the door she decided that Chief Bermudez
was a good man.

182
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:29,899
Perhaps she should buy him some gabardine
material too.

183
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:37,850
After all, he had added several extra months
to her pay rise.

184
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:45,760
After a quick lunch, just some bananas and
a drink, she went to Finance.

185
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:54,659
The girls in the office were sitting talking,
or reading newspapers, or doing nothing.

186
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:05,389
The Finance Chief, she was told, was out and
would not be in until tomorrow.

187
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,529
Marina left, and decided to go and see a movie.

188
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:20,120
The next morning she was back in Finance before
eight o'clock.

189
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:28,820
She noticed that the office had several pretty
girls, and they seemed to do nothing.

190
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:39,169
At eight-thirty the Finance Chief arrived,
Julio Lobo, one of the top men in the Ministry.

191
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:47,320
He was wearing a brown gabardine suit - she
recognized the material at once.

192
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,740
She went into his office.

193
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:58,240
Chief Lobo was reading some files and adding
up some figures on a calculator.

194
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,570
He looked up at her.

195
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,350
There were heavy bags under his eyes, and
his thick lips smiled.

196
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,740
'Yes?'

197
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:16,990
Mrs Salcedo explained her story, telling him
she was from the province.

198
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:23,810
'You can leave your papers here,' he said,
still smiling.

199
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,509
'I am in a hurry.

200
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:35,889
I have a meeting in another town today and
will not be back until five.

201
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:40,629
You can come and see me then.'

202
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:48,389
Marina now had to wait all day, and this endless
battle to get her promotion was giving her

203
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:49,429
a headache.

204
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,789
But it could be worse in other ministries.

205
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:04,240
She knew a teacher who had to pay a thousand
pesos just to move to another town.

206
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:12,139
It was raining outside so she decided to stay
in the building and visit the Education office,

207
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,539
where she had friends.

208
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:25,749
At three o'clock she went back to wait outside
Chief Lobo's office, and tried to read a novel,

209
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:28,350
but it did not hold her interest.

210
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:38,440
The pretty girls in the office were all talking
about the disco they were going to that evening.

211
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,809
At five Chief Lobo arrived, and some of the
girls went in and out with papers.

212
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,940
When they had left, Marina went in.

213
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:58,960
'Ah, Mrs Salcedo - yes, your papers are still
here.

214
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,000
I will work on them tomorrow, Saturday.

215
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,380
Did you know I work even on Saturday?'

216
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,919
'No, sir.'

217
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
'Well, I do.

218
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,820
' He smiled, showing teeth yellow from cigarette
smoke.

219
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:26,570
He looked at his desk diary, then at her papers
again.

220
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:32,059
'Mmm... a hundred pesos a month.

221
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:38,659
Why, that's one thousand two hundred pesos
a year.

222
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:44,909
Surely, you can afford to buy me a forty-peso
dinner!'

223
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:49,590
'Yes, of course, sir,' she said.

224
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:58,110
'Well, then, my favorite Japanese restaurant
is in Ermita.

225
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,720
It's easy to find.

226
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,899
I'll be there on Sunday evening, at seven.

227
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:10,389
I will have your papers - all finished.

228
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:14,799
I see no problem, really.'

229
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,769
'Thank you, sir,' Mrs Salcedo said.

230
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,549
Forty pesos!

231
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:29,500
If she did not eat, she could afford the meal.

232
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,659
She would still just have enough to buy her
bus ticket.

233
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:43,090
During Saturday and Sunday morning Marina
did not leave her cousin's apartment.

234
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,399
Going out meant spending money.

235
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:54,500
So she made rice cakes, cleaned her cousin's
kitchen, and washed the floor and the walls

236
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,320
in the living room.

237
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,960
When the family came home Saturday evening,
the place was shining clean, and her cousin

238
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,149
was very pleased.

239
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:16,580
On Sunday afternoon she went out to find the
Japanese restaurant.

240
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:24,480
It was mostly foreigners eating there, and
it looked very expensive.

241
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,279
She would have to give the waiters something
too.

242
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:37,070
She must be honest with Chief Lobo, tell him
that she did not have the money, that she

243
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:44,929
would give him a present later, when she had
got her pay rise.

244
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:54,789
From there she went to the Manila Hotel, where
in 1955 she had danced with her boyfriend,

245
00:23:54,789 --> 00:24:01,470
later her husband, when they finished their
university studies.

246
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,299
It was pleasant to remember those days.

247
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:14,919
But the hotel had changed - it was all new
inside, with thick carpets and fine wooden

248
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,259
furniture.

249
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:25,289
She saw the coffee shop, but she could not
afford even one cup of coffee, so she sat

250
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:33,649
on one of the deep soft sofas, watching the
beautiful people walking past.

251
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:46,340
So, there was progress under the government's
grand new plan, as this fine hotel showed.

252
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,629
At six-thirty she walked back to the Japanese
restaurant.

253
00:24:52,629 --> 00:25:01,249
Chief Lobo was there, his fat stomach too
big for his blue jeans, and his T-shirt smelly

254
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,990
from his unwashed body.

255
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:14,529
They sat down, and all around them were the
delicious smells of fresh food cooking.

256
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,320
Marina found it hard to speak.

257
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,860
'Sir, you know I am just a poor clerk in the
province.

258
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,669
I have only a hundred pesos-'

259
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:35,249
Chief Lobo's hand came down heavily onto her
knee, and stayed there.

260
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:39,510
'My dear woman,' he said.

261
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:45,029
'We are not going to spend all that.

262
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:51,980
I will just have tea, and... some fish.

263
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,720
Too much food is bad for me.

264
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,100
But making love is not bad for me.

265
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:08,389
So, after this, we go to a motel.

266
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:14,070
That will be no more than forty pesos...'

267
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,249
Marina did not want to believe what she had
heard.

268
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:27,249
Then she remembered office talk about the
Finance Chief - how he behaved towards women,

269
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,340
what he asked for...

270
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,289
'I have three children, sir,' she said miserably.

271
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:42,320
'My oldest is married, I have a grandson,
the first.'

272
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,899
'That's wonderful,' said Chief Lobo.

273
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:53,639
'But you know, you don't look like a grandmother.'

274
00:26:53,639 --> 00:27:00,179
He looked at her body hungrily, and Marina
felt her face turning red.

275
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,620
'You have a good body, very nice...'

276
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,590
'Surely, sir, with all those pretty girls
in your office...'

277
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,379
Chief Lobo laughed.

278
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:15,379
'Ha!

279
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:18,009
You noticed,' he said.

280
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:23,960
'But they are young, they need teaching.

281
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,080
I don't want to be a teacher all the time.

282
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:36,679
I enjoy beautiful, older women - like you.'

283
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,850
His hand moved higher up her leg.

284
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,220
'I am forty-five,' said Marina.

285
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,590
'But you don't look thirty-five!' he said.

286
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,309
She followed him to his car outside in the
street.

287
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,590
Her mouth was dry with fear.

288
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,539
She must be good to him.

289
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:06,330
The future was in his hands.

290
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:13,970
She tried again and again to talk him out
of it, but he did not listen.

291
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:22,759
Alone with him in the motel room at last,
she begged him one more time.

292
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,409
'Sir, please.

293
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,460
I will give you half the money I get from
my promotion.

294
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,580
I promise!'

295
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,370
Chief Lobo looked at her in surprise.

296
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:46,419
'Stupid girl,' he said angrily 'It's not money
I need.'

297
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:50,730
He began to take off his shoes.

298
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,409
When she did not move, he shouted at her.

299
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,570
'Take off your clothes!'

300
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:13,659
'My poor husband, my poor children,' Marina
cried softly as he began to touch her.

301
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:17,350
She was back at the apartment at nine.

302
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:26,669
She took a long shower, hating Chief Lobo,
hating herself, hating the world.

303
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:31,149
How would it be tomorrow when she saw him
again?

304
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:37,480
He had not even brought her papers as he had
promised.

305
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,790
She did not sleep much that night.

306
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:48,070
When morning came, she knew she must go on,
finish the job.

307
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:55,059
After that terrible evening, there was no
battle that she could not fight - nothing

308
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,249
could stop her now.

309
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:04,669
Chief Lobo's thick lips smiled at her when
she came in.

310
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:16,549
'We will go up to the Minister's office now,'
he said, standing up and picking up her papers.

311
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:25,000
The Minister's office was very big, with a
carpet, paintings on the walls, and tall green

312
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,830
plants in the corners.

313
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:40,299
Minister Guzman was also wearing a brown gabardine
suit, but Marina, looking at it closely, realized

314
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:45,770
it was a finer, more expensive material.

315
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,789
She had heard that the Minister had a drinking
problem.

316
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:59,720
He certainly seemed strange this morning - either
sleepy or drunk.

317
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,639
Chief Lobo put Marina's papers on the desk,
and the Minister looked through them.

318
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:14,859
'Ah, Mrs Salcedo... your promotion...

319
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:19,130
I am very happy to sign these.'

320
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,580
To Chief Lobo.

321
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,900
'Are there funds for this?'

322
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,169
'Yes, sir,' Lobo said.

323
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:35,559
After the Minister had signed the papers,
he turned to her again.

324
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:43,440
'Mrs Salcedo, how is it in your province?

325
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,830
What are your problems?

326
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,000
It's good to see someone from your province
here.

327
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:01,830
You know, your province is very important
in our New Society plan.'

328
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:05,080
Mrs Salcedo looked at him.

329
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,919
Was the Minister serious?

330
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,110
How could he be so drunk so early in the morning?

331
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,869
She shook her head.

332
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:18,980
'We have no problems, sir.'

333
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,450
'Come now,' the Minister said.

334
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,440
'Be honest.

335
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,080
We need the truth, the facts.

336
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,450
Only that way can we make progress.'

337
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,149
Marina shook her head again.

338
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:42,049
'Everything is fine in our province, sir,'
she said.

339
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:47,190
'All right then,' the Minister said.

340
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,739
'But you must work hard.

341
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:51,739
All of you.

342
00:32:51,739 --> 00:33:04,179
You must remember we are building a New Society,
progress for the people, a country to be proud

343
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,090
of.'

344
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,720
He seemed to be talking to everyone in the
office.

345
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,630
'Yes, sir,' Marina said.

346
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,009
'We must all work together.

347
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:19,379
Progress.

348
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:29,350
Promotions are wonderful, but we must work
for them.

349
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,470
Progress...'

350
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:38,159
After Marina had bought her bus ticket, she
had two pesos left.

351
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,529
She had made three meat sandwiches at her
cousin's, and that would have to be enough

352
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:48,669
until she got home.

353
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:54,639
When the bus arrived in her town, it was past
six and already dark.

354
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:01,870
To save money, she decided to walk home from
the bus station.

355
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:13,020
She only had a handbag, a small bag of clothes,
the gabardine material, and two apples.

356
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:19,160
Away from the town centre, the road was unlit
and rough.

357
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:26,419
She and her family lived on the edge of the
town, where they could grow vegetables and

358
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:30,190
keep chickens.

359
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:38,850
She had just turned a corner when a man jumped
out of the shadows and grabbed her handbag.

360
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:47,050
She held on to it as hard as she could, but
the man pushed her and she fell, hurting her

361
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,810
face on the ground.

362
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:55,760
He took the bag, and as he ran, she shouted
after him.

363
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,440
'There's no money in there - just my papers.

364
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,350
My papers!'

365
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:11,290
But he was gone too fast and did not hear
her.

366
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:17,510
She stood up slowly, feeling weak and strange.

367
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:24,960
She still had a long way to walk, and her
legs did not want to move.

368
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:33,340
It started to rain, but her umbrella was in
the handbag that was stolen.

369
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:40,580
She did not mind the rain; it was losing her
papers that felt like a heavy stone lying

370
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,260
on her heart.

371
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,490
Without the papers, there would be no pay
rise.

372
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:57,870
She knew, only too well, that nothing could
make Manila send copies of her papers.

373
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:04,470
She would have to return to the capital, and
the thought of that filled her heart with

374
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,470
fear and misery.

375
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:15,600
At last she reached her house, with the trees
all around it.

376
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:22,520
When she pushed the door open, her family
were eating supper and they ran from the table

377
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,410
to greet her.

378
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:34,400
They saw the dirt on her clothes, her pale
face, her wet untidy hair.

379
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:44,120
To their questions she gave no answers, and
Marina Salcedo fell to her knees, the anger

380
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,000
and misery coming from her in violent sobbing.

381
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:59,560
No words of kindness, of love, no friendly
touch could stop the river of her tears.

382
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,990
- THE END -
