CHAPTER ONE
Journey to Istanbul

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,890
It is early morning on a sunny spring day
in April.

3
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,450
Heathrow Airport, London, is busy, as usual.

4
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:54,629
Hundreds of people are arriving, leaving,
or waiting for planes.

5
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,720
In the Departure Lounge of Terminal One, a
man is sitting reading a newspaper.

6
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,159
He does not like airports.

7
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,450
There are too many people, and he is always
nervous when he flies.

8
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,840
He looks at his watch impatiently.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,240
Then he hears the announcement over the loudspeakers.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,299
'British Airways announce the departure of
Flight BE570 for Istanbul.

11
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,200
Will passengers please proceed to Gate 16
for boarding.'

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,310
Tom Smith picks up his suitcase and walks
towards Gate 16.

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,079
Twenty minutes later, the plane is preparing
to leave.

14
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,170
It moves slowly across the airport to runway
number two.

15
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,560
Tom is sitting looking out of the window.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,490
The plane suddenly moves forward, races down
the runway and rises into the air.

17
00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:01,899
Tom looks down at the houses and roads far
below, and smiles.

18
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:04,350
London is behind him.

19
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,920
Now he is on his way to Istanbul.

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,770
Tom relaxed and took a letter from his pocket.

21
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:23,570
Resat Bey Apt 11-3, Kamerot Sokak, Ayazpasa,
Istanbul.

22
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,870
My dear Tom,

23
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,770
Thank you for your letter.

24
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,740
I am so happy that you can come and visit
me for a holiday.

25
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,270
Life here in Istanbul is very interesting.

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,400
I am enjoying my work, but I miss you very
much.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,640
It will be wonderful to see you again.

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,010
I'm sure we will have a very nice holiday.

29
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,930
Spring is here, and the weather is beautiful.

30
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,420
I have to work on Monday 14th of April - the
day you arrive.

31
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,120
So I can't come to the airport to meet you,
but you can take a taxi from the Air Terminal

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,189
to Taksim Square.

33
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:11,540
That's in the centre of the new part of the
city.

34
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,900
There's a big hotel called the Park Hotel
near the square.

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,409
I'll meet you there at 5 o'clock.

36
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,409
We'll meet in the American Bar.

37
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,409
The view over the city is beautiful.

38
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,959
I can't wait to see you again, Tom.

39
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,010
I have so much to tell you.

40
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,819
So remember, the Park Hotel, Taksim Square,
5 o'clock.

41
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,829
See you on the 14th.

42
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,340
love,

43
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,849
Angela.

44
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:51,459
Tom sat for a moment, looking at his fiance's
letter.

45
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,620
Then he put it in his pocket.

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,249
He looked down at the green fields of France,
as the plane continued its journey across

47
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,249
Europe.

48
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:05,205
'Have you been to Istanbul before?' said a
voice.

49
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:09,540
It was the young man in the next seat.

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,379
'No, I haven't,' said Tom.

51
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,659
'Have you?'

52
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,579
The man smiled.

53
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,840
'My home is in Istanbul.

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,310
I'm studying in London at the moment.

55
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm going home for a holiday.'

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,170
'Really?' said Tom.

57
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,950
'Where are you studying?'

58
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,680
'At London University.'

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
The two men sat talking, as the stewardesses
began serving lunch.

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,690
The young man told Tom his name was Kemal.

61
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,920
His parents had a shop in Istanbul.

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,040
'Are you meeting someone in Istanbul?'

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,220
Kemal asked.

64
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,380
'My fiance,' said Tom.

65
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,411
'She's working in Istanbul.'

66
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,411
'That's interesting.

67
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,411
How long has she been there?'

68
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,070
She went to Istanbul two months ago.

69
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:06,660
She works for a small company which is starting
to export to England.

70
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,810
She's making all the arrangements.'

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,940
'Exporting always seems so difficult,' said
Kemal.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,990
'It seems difficult,' Tom agreed.

73
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,270
'But that's Angela's job.

74
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,260
She's an expert in importing and exporting.

75
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,670
Her father has an import/export agency in
London and she has worked for him for some

76
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,610
years.

77
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,600
She's almost completed her work in Istanbul
now.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,830
The company has already started to send goods
to England.

79
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,180
She'll be coming back to London soon.'

80
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,490
'What kind of goods do they export?' asked
Kemal.

81
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:56,420
'All kind of things - brass ornaments, coffee-pots,
trays leather and onyx articles - Angela's

82
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,420
father thinks these goods will sell very well
in England.'

83
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,090
'That's interesting,' said Kemal.

84
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:12,930
'My parents sell things like that in their
shop in Istanbul.'

85
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,900
The two men went on talking as the plane flew
over Italy and Greece towards Turkey.

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,840
Soon they were descending to Yesilkoy Airport,
Istanbul.

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,910
When the plane stopped, Kemal stood up.

88
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,850
'I hope you enjoy your stay in Istanbul,'
he said.

89
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,010
'Here's my telephone number.

90
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,250
If you need anything, phone me.

91
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,710
I live in Sisli.

92
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,290
It's not far from the centre of the city.'

93
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,030
'Thanks, Kemal, that's very kind of you.'

94
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,780
'Not at all,' replied Kemal.

95
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
'Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
And now, goodbye.'

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,090
Tom went through Customs and Immigration and
walked towards the airport exit.

98
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:10,280
CHAPTER TWO
The American Bar

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:20,820
A bus for the City Air Terminal was waiting
outside the airport.

100
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,930
Tom got in and sat down beside the window.

101
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:34,370
Other passengers got on and the bus left the
airport and drove towards Istanbul.

102
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,060
Soon they were driving past the houses and
apartment blocks near the city.

103
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Then they passed the old city walls.

104
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,550
Tom felt excited, and looked at everything.

105
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,920
He saw beautiful old mosques and street markets.

106
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,670
The bus was now approaching the centre of
old Istanbul.

107
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,100
It stopped at some traffic lights.

108
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,810
A car stopped beside the bus.

109
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,750
The door opened and a woman got out.

110
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,030
Two men were with her.

111
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:17,620
Suddenly Tom jumped to his feet.

112
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
It was Angela!

113
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
'Angela!'

114
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
Tom shouted.

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
'Angela!

116
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Here!

117
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
It's me, Tom!'

118
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,880
He knocked on the bus window.

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,940
Suddenly the traffic lights changed and the
bus moved forward.

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,140
Tom ran to the back of the bus.

121
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,079
Angela and the two men were going into a building.

122
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,079
'Angela!' he shouted.

123
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,079
'An...'

124
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,079
He stopped.

125
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,079
It was too late.

126
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:50,290
The bus was moving quickly down a wide street.

127
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,150
The passengers were looking at Tom and he
suddenly felt foolish.

128
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,040
He walked back to his seat and sat down.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,450
What a surprise, he thought to himself.

130
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,610
I must tell her when I see her this evening.

131
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,850
Then the bus crossed Ataturk Bridge and Tom
looked at the boats on the Golden Horn.

132
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,820
Again he felt excited.

133
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,050
The bus arrived at the Air Terminal at a quarter
to four.

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,320
There were some taxis waiting there.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,710
Tom went up to one.

136
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,860
'The Park Hotel, Taksim Square, please,' he
told the driver.

137
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,200
'English?

138
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,210
You come with me.

139
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,610
I take you quickly.'

140
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,080
At a quarter past four, the taxi arrived in
the square.

141
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,130
'Here you are, sir, the Park Hotel.'

142
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,360
'Thank you,' said Tom, and paid the driver.

143
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,910
Tom went into the hotel.

144
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,330
He found the American Bar and sat down at
a table on the terrace.

145
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,020
A waiter came out.

146
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,070
'A beer, please,' said Tom.

147
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:15,040
He sat in the afternoon sunshine, and looked
down over the city of Istanbul.

148
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,982
The view was very beautiful.

149
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:17,982
He was looking at the sea.

150
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:18,982
The Bosphorus was full of ships.

151
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:23,740
There were very big ships going to Russia
and little sailing ships.

152
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,820
In the distance, he could see the mosques
and palaces of old Istanbul.

153
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,370
How beautiful and how exciting!

154
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,920
Tom looked at his watch.

155
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,470
It was nearly five o'clock.

156
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,630
He got up and walked up to the hotel entrance.

157
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,950
There were lots of people going in and out
of the hotel.

158
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,300
But he did not see Angela anywhere.

159
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,510
He went back to the bar and ordered another
beer.

160
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,560
Come on Angela, Tom said to himself.

161
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,720
Don't be late.

162
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,540
Just inside the American Bar a man in a grey
raincoat was sitting at a table.

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,380
He was drinking coffee and smoking cheap cigarettes.

164
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,770
A newspaper lay open on the table in front
of him, and from time to time he looked at

165
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,770
it.

166
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,800
But the man wasn't reading the newspaper - he
was watching Tom.

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It was now twenty past five.

168
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,390
Tom sat in the evening sunshine.

169
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,430
He looked at his watch again, and waited.

170
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,840
Half past five.

171
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Quarter to six.

172
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,870
It was getting dark.

173
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,320
He looked at the lights on the Bosphorus.

174
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,820
Strange, thought Tom.

175
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,180
Angela isn't usually late.

176
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,870
Tom sat at the table, on the terrace of the
American Bar, waiting for his fiance.

177
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,310
He waited, and waited, and nobody came.

178
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:19,360
And the man in the grey raincoat sat patiently
inside the bar, smoking, and watching Tom.

179
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,400
'Another beer, sir?' asked the waiter.

180
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,730
'No, bring me a black coffee, please.

181
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,980
Have you a telephone?'

182
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,660
'Yes, sir, inside.'

183
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,480
Tom went into the hotel.

184
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,060
There was a telephone beside the reception.

185
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,930
Tom dialled Angela's number.

186
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,410
The phone rang and rang, but nobody answered
it.

187
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:53,480
He put the phone down and turned towards the
reception desk.

188
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,620
'Excuse me,' he asked the receptionist, 'Kamerot
Sokak - do you know where it is?'

189
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,070
'Yes, it's very near.

190
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,290
Go out of the hotel entrance and turn right.

191
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:12,410
Walk along the street - and Kamerot Sokak
is fourth on the right.'

192
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,740
'Thank you,' said Tom.

193
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,670
Tom went back to the bar.

194
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,380
He drank his coffee and paid for his drinks.

195
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,850
It was now after eight o'clock.

196
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,980
Tom picked up his suitcase and left the hotel.

197
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,340
Inside the bar, the man in the grey raincoat
stood up and picked up his newspaper.

198
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,160
He put some money on the table and walked
out into the street.

199
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,840
He stood on the pavement for a moment or two,
then started walking.

200
00:13:50,840 --> 00:14:01,900
CHAPTER THREE
A Shock

201
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:10,790
Kamerot Sokak was a narrow, quiet street of
old apartment buildings.

202
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,070
Tom walked along the pavement, looking at
the numbers on the doors.

203
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,260
There was only one street light and it was
difficult to see.

204
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,860
But finally, he found Angela's address, number
11.

205
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,410
The building had a large glass door.

206
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,910
Tom pushed it, but it was locked.

207
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,490
There was no bell.

208
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,649
He knocked on the door.

209
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,730
Nothing happened.

210
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,810
He knocked again, louder this time, and listened.

211
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,870
Silence.

212
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,220
Damn, he thought.

213
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,980
He was impatient now.

214
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
And worried.

215
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,570
He stood back in the middle of the street
and looked up.

216
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,240
There were five floors, and all the windows
were black.

217
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,920
There was no light anywhere in the building.

218
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,490
Angela, he said to himself, Angela!

219
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,250
Where are you?

220
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:22,760
A short distance away, the man in the grey
raincoat stood in a dark doorway.

221
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,279
He was watching Tom, watching every move he
made...

222
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,649
Tom did not know what to do.

223
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:39,750
He knocked once more on the glass door - again
nothing happened.

224
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,490
Finally, he picked up his suitcase.

225
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:50,890
With a last look at the building, he turned
and started walking back towards Taksim Square.

226
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,149
Tom Smith, he thought to himself, as he walked.

227
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:58,200
You need a hot bath and a good sleep.

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,640
Then you can decide what to do.

229
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:08,930
The Park Hotel was expensive, but Tom remembered
seeing one or two small hotels near Taksim

230
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,390
Square.

231
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:19,240
Finally, he was standing outside the Ankara
Hotel.

232
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
He went in.

233
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
'Good evening,' he said to the woman at reception.

234
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,430
'I'd like a single room, please.'

235
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,070
The woman nodded.

236
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,430
'We have a nice room upstairs.

237
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,270
Come, I'll show you.'

238
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:39,210
They went upstairs and she opened a door.

239
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,150
'Very nice room,' she said.

240
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,460
It was small, but it was clean and it looked
comfortable.

241
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,820
'I'll take it,' he said, and gave the woman
his passport.

242
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,470
'The bathroom is along the corridor,' she
said.

243
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,730
'Breakfast is from eight to ten o'clock.

244
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,300
Goodnight.'

245
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,290
Tom put his case down and sat on the bed.

246
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,540
He suddenly felt very tired and unhappy.

247
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,289
He was not having a good dinner in a nice
restaurant.

248
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,600
He was not sitting with the woman he loved.

249
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,699
He was sitting alone, in a cheap hotel, in
a strange city.

250
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:27,689
For a long time he sat on the bed thinking,
But I saw Angela.

251
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:32,179
I saw her from the bus!

252
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,650
Finally he stood up.

253
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,679
OK, he thought.

254
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,440
Tomorrow morning I'll go to Angela's office
and find out what has happened.

255
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,380
There's a very simple explanation, I'm sure.

256
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,610
I'll find out tomorrow.

257
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,960
He had a hot bath and got into bed.

258
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,750
He was very tired after his long journey and
soon fell asleep.

259
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:04,410
The man in the grey raincoat walked across
Taksim Square.

260
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,909
There was a telephone kiosk in the corner.

261
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:12,239
He dialled a number, and waited.

262
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,460
Then he spoke.

263
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,679
'He's in the Ankara Hotel,' the man said.

264
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,330
'He waited at the Park Hotel and then he went
to the girl's flat.

265
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,700
Now he's in the Ankara Hotel...

266
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,630
Yes, yes of course I will.'

267
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,950
He put down the phone and left the kiosk.

268
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,769
The next morning, Tom felt much better.

269
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:47,889
He had breakfast, then took a taxi to the
office where Angela worked.

270
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:55,510
The taxi drove through the busy streets and
crossed the Galata Bridge into the old city.

271
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,249
Finally, it turned into a small street near
the Railway Station.

272
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:06,649
It was a narrow street of shops, small businesses
and workshops.

273
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,960
The taxi stopped in front of a grey building.

274
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,889
"F. Karamian and Co.

275
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,290
Export/Import Agency", said the sign above
the door.

276
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,170
Tom pushed open the door and went in.

277
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,980
A secretary was typing at the reception desk.

278
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,659
She looked up as Tom came in.

279
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:32,620
'Good morning,' she smiled.

280
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,351
'Good morning,' said Tom.

281
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:35,351
'My name's Tom Smith.

282
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:38,330
I'm looking for Angela Thomson - she's my
fiance.

283
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:47,029
I arrived in Istanbul last night and waited
for her, but she didn't...'

284
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,110
The secretary was staring at him.

285
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,510
She stood up.

286
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,499
'Wait a moment, please, Mr Smith.'

287
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:59,970
She hurried over to a door marked "Office",
and went inside.

288
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,220
Tom could hear her talking to someone.

289
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,080
The door opened and a man came out.

290
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,989
He looked very serious.

291
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:15,860
'Mr Smith, my name's Diinya.

292
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,779
Please come in.'

293
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,270
Tom went into the office.

294
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,230
'Please sit down, Mr Smith,' said Diinya.

295
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:34,520
'Look - er, I don't know how to tell you this,
Mr Smith.

296
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,850
I have some very bad news for you.

297
00:20:37,850 --> 00:21:00,779
I'm very sorry indeed, but Miss Thomson, your
fiance - is - is dead.'

298
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:05,059
CHAPTER FOUR
'I Saw Her'

299
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:09,940
Drink this, Mr Smith,' said Mr Diinya.

300
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,919
He handed Tom a glass of strong brandy.

301
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,950
Tom sat, shocked, white-faced, unable to speak.

302
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,639
He drank the brandy slowly.

303
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,909
'How - how did it happen?' he asked.

304
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,549
'A car accident.

305
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,190
Miss Thomson was driving along a dangerous
road.

306
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,090
No one knows what happened.

307
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,080
Her car went off the road and fell down the
hillside.'

308
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,519
'Yesterday evening?'

309
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,529
Tom asked.

310
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,860
'I beg your pardon?'

311
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,600
'The accident - it happened yesterday evening?'

312
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,539
Diinya looked at him.

313
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:06,929
'Mr Smith, the accident happened a week ago
- last Sunday to be exact.

314
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,039
She had been away to Bursa for the weekend
and...'

315
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,940
'But that's impossible!' said Tom.

316
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,700
'I saw Angela yesterday!'

317
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
'Yesterday?'

318
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
'Yes.

319
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:24,090
I was on the airport bus, coming into Istanbul.

320
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,919
I saw her in the street.'

321
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:32,830
'I'm terribly sorry, Mr Smith, but you're
making a mistake.'

322
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,320
'No, I tell you I saw her.

323
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I...'

324
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,470
'Mr Smith,' Diinya said patiently, 'Istanbul
is a big city.

325
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,850
There must be hundreds of women here who look
like your fiance.'

326
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,850
Tom said nothing.

327
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,429
'The British Consulate were very helpful,'
continued Mr Diinya.

328
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,700
'They made all the arrangements for the funeral.

329
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,019
It was on Wednesday.'

330
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,929
'Have her parents been told about this?'

331
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,299
Tom asked.

332
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,419
'That is a problem, I'm afraid.

333
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,330
Her parents are on holiday in France.

334
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,820
The British and French police are trying to
contact them.'

335
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,510
'So they don't know yet,' said Tom quietly.

336
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,429
'No, they don't, I'm afraid.'

337
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,659
There was a long silence.

338
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:42,110
'Can I have another brandy, please?' asked
Tom.

339
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,909
'Of course.'

340
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,730
Tom tried hard to think clearly.

341
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:53,129
'I thought I saw her yesterday,' he said softly.

342
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:56,899
'I understand, Mr Smith.

343
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:03,490
It's a great shock - a terrible tragedy for
you - for all of us.'

344
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:12,760
After a pause, Diinya asked, 'What will you
do now, Mr Smith?

345
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,240
Is there anything I can do to help?'

346
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,249
'I'm not sure,' said Tom.

347
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,769
'I need some time to think.

348
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:23,950
I don't know what to do.'

349
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,960
'Do you know anyone in Istanbul?'

350
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,400
Suddenly Tom remembered Kemal.

351
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,159
'Yes, yes, I have friends, don't worry.

352
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,320
Look, Mr Diinya, I can't decide anything now.

353
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,361
I think I'll stay in Istanbul for a day or
two.

354
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:52,470
I'd like to visit the Consulate, and maybe
the police.'

355
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,359
Mr Diinya opened a drawer in his desk and
took out a card.

356
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,229
He wrote on it and handed the card to Tom.

357
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:05,289
'I've written down the telephone number of
Mr David Pennington.

358
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:11,700
He's the man in the Consulate who made the
arrangements for the funeral.

359
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,360
The other number is my office telephone number.

360
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,910
Contact me if you need anything.

361
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,470
I'm here during the day.'

362
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,720
Tom stood up.

363
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,600
'I must go now,' he said.

364
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,669
'Thank you, you've been most kind.'

365
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:35,350
Mr Diinya walked with him to the door.

366
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:42,820
'Well, Mr Smith, once again, I'm terribly
sorry.'

367
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,519
'You know I was so sure I saw her.

368
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,519
So sure...'

369
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:51,519
Tom said.

370
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,169
'I understand,' replied Diinya.

371
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:56,289
'It's a terrible shock.'

372
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,539
The two men shook hands.

373
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:08,100
'Remember, come here any time if you need
anything,' said Mr Diinya.

374
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,119
'Goodbye, now.'

375
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,499
'Goodbye,' said Tom, and walked out into the
street.

376
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:18,900
Mr Diinya turned and walked back into his
office.

377
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,309
He closed the door carefully and sat down
at his desk.

378
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,890
For a few minutes he sat thinking.

379
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,200
Then he picked up the telephone.

380
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,559
Tom walked slowly through the crowded streets
of old Istanbul.

381
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,869
The streets were busy, and full of interesting
people, shops and cafes.

382
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:46,210
But Tom did not see any of those things.

383
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,999
He was not interested in Istanbul, he was
not a tourist any more.

384
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:55,289
Tom was thinking of Angela.

385
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:59,090
He remembered the journey on the bus from
the airport.

386
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,570
He was sure he had seen Angela.

387
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:10,860
She had been there on the pavement, getting
out of a car.

388
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,289
But Diinya said it was not Angela.

389
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:15,419
Angela was dead.

390
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,619
She had died a week ago.

391
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:22,630
Tom walked through the streets of the city.

392
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,049
He walked through the Grand Bazaar.

393
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:31,190
He walked on and on through narrow old streets.

394
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,330
He didn't know where he was, or what time
it was.

395
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,679
He thought about Angela.

396
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,499
He thought again about his journey on the
bus from the airport.

397
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:51,909
Again and again he thought about it, and again
and again he saw his fiance.

398
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:56,639
Then he stopped walking, and stood for a moment
on the pavement.

399
00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:01,109
He was standing on a street beside the sea.

400
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:06,340
Angela isn't dead, he thought.

401
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,059
I saw her!

402
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,720
He looked in his pocket and found Kemal's
telephone number.

403
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,989
He walked quickly across the street to a cafe.

404
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:25,700
He went inside to the telephone.

405
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,059
'Hello, Kemal?

406
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,799
Hello, it's me, Tom.

407
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,799
Remember...?

408
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,210
Yes, yes, fine thanks.

409
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:39,200
Listen, remember you said I could phone you
if I needed anything?

410
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,239
Well, something has happened.

411
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:53,279
Can we meet somewhere?'

412
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,029
CHAPTER FIVE
A Disappointing Day

413
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:04,649
'So,' said Kemal, 'you really think you saw
her, do you?'

414
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:10,479
Kemal and Tom were sitting in the American
Bar at the Park Hotel.

415
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:14,549
Tom thought carefully for a moment before
answering.

416
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,299
'Yes,' he said slowly.

417
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,179
'Yes, I do.

418
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,379
You probably think I imagined it.

419
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:27,840
I understand that.

420
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,609
But I'm convinced I saw her, that's all.'

421
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,369
Kemal nodded.

422
00:29:34,369 --> 00:29:39,759
'I can't stop thinking about yesterday,' Tom
continued.

423
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:45,299
'I close my eyes and I can see Angela there
on the pavement.

424
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,350
I can't forget that.'

425
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,299
'Listen, Tom,' said Kemal.

426
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,989
'We only met yesterday but already we're friends.

427
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:02,200
You're in my country, you're my friend, and
you need help.

428
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,619
If you think you saw Angela, that's enough
for me.

429
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,119
I believe you.

430
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,099
Now we have to decide what to do.'

431
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:17,960
'There are two things I want to do as soon
as possible,' said Tom.

432
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,379
'I want to go to the street where I saw Angela.

433
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:27,161
Then I want to go to the British Consulate.

434
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,161
I have an appointment for this afternoon.'

435
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,990
'OK,' said Kemal.

436
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,990
'The street where you saw Angela.

437
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,059
Do you think you can remember where it is?'

438
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,460
'No problem,' said Tom.

439
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,850
'We can drive along the same route as the
airport bus.

440
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,840
I'm sure I'll remember it.'

441
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,230
'And what do you think you will find there?'

442
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,230
'I'm not sure.

443
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,659
But she was going into a building with two
men.

444
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:59,320
At least we can find the building - maybe
that will tell us something.'

445
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,419
'OK,' said Kemal.

446
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,789
'My car's outside.

447
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:05,370
Let's go.'

448
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,500
Tom and Kemal were driving through the city.

449
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,080
'It was a wide street,' said Tom.

450
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,259
'We came to a roundabout after the traffic
lights.

451
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:22,029
We turned left and then we passed an old aqueduct.'

452
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:23,889
'Aksaray,' said Kemal.

453
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:25,049
'It's near here.'

454
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,429
Kemal drove over Ataturk Bridge.

455
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,879
After a few minutes, they saw the old aqueduct.

456
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,539
Then they came to a large roundabout and turned
right.

457
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,741
'This is it,' said Tom.

458
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:39,741
'It's somewhere near here.'

459
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,741
They were approaching some traffic lights.

460
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:47,979
Tom looked out of the window at the buildings
on the left.

461
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:48,979
'No,' he said.

462
00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:49,979
'Not here.'

463
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:50,979
They drove on to the next traffic lights.

464
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,539
'This is it,' said Tom.

465
00:31:52,539 --> 00:32:00,210
'This is the place.'

466
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,869
Kemal stopped the car.

467
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:04,659
'You get out.

468
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,659
I'll find a parking place.'

469
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,549
Tom got out and looked around him.

470
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,309
He was in a wide street of shops and offices.

471
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:21,220
A newspaper kiosk, a travel agency - he remembered
them from the day before.

472
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:28,080
He stood looking at the buildings opposite
until Kemal arrived.

473
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,340
Tom pointed across the street to the entrance
to an office building.

474
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,100
'That's it, I think,' he said.

475
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,720
They crossed the street and looked at the
name plate beside the entrance to the office

476
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
block.

477
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,590
There were many names there a lawyer, a dentist,
a doctor, and many other offices.

478
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,009
Tom stood looking at the names for a few moments.

479
00:32:56,009 --> 00:33:01,659
'Well,' he said finally, 'I'm sure she went
into this building.

480
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,710
But which office was she going to?

481
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:10,499
Was she going to see a lawyer, or a dentist,
or a doctor?

482
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:13,159
How do we begin to find out?'

483
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,840
Kemal took his arm gently, and they walked
slowly back to the car.

484
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,279
'Listen, Tom,' he said.

485
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,139
'You're going too fast.

486
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:31,470
You can't expect to find out everything immediately.

487
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,000
Wait until you see the man at the Consulate.

488
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,570
After that, we'll think about it.

489
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,619
Then we can decide what to do.

490
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,019
We know she was going into that building.

491
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,190
That's something, anyway.

492
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,090
Now look, it's lunch-time.

493
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,379
You must be hungry.

494
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:52,279
I know a good restaurant near here...'

495
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,239
'You're right,' said Tom.

496
00:33:54,239 --> 00:34:08,200
'We have to be patient.'

497
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,950
CHAPTER SIX
Visit to the Consulate

498
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:20,780
After lunch, Kemal drove Tom to the British
Consulate in Mesrutiyet Street.

499
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,320
He stopped the car at the gate.

500
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,419
'Well, good luck,' he said.

501
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,750
'I'll wait for you.'

502
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,110
Tom opened the car door.

503
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,210
'It's very good of you to help me like this
Kemal.

504
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,730
Thanks very much.'

505
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,899
'Not at all,' said Kemal.

506
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,779
'See you later.'

507
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:45,539
Tom went through the Consulate gates.

508
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:52,389
The old Consulate, with beautiful gardens
round it, looked like a palace.

509
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,040
Tom pushed the big door open and went in.

510
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,990
'I'd like to see Mr David Pennington, please,'
he said at the reception desk.

511
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,250
'My name's Tom Smith.

512
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,510
I have an appointment.'

513
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,940
After a few minutes, a tall man wearing glasses
came to meet him.

514
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,440
'Mr Smith, my name's Pennington.

515
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,920
How do you do?' said the man, holding out
his hand.

516
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,869
Tom shook Mr Pennington's hand.

517
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:25,940
'How do you do,' he replied.

518
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,550
'Come into my office, please, Mr Smith.

519
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,859
Mr Diinya told me you were coming.'

520
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:40,430
They walked up the beautiful staircase of
the Consulate and went into Mr Pennington's

521
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,430
office.

522
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,130
'Sit down, please,' said Pennington.

523
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:51,240
'Mr Smith, I'm very sorry about your fiance.

524
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,280
It was a great tragedy.

525
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,329
Please accept my condolences.'

526
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,190
'Thank you,' said Tom.

527
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,770
Mr Pennington took two files from his desk.

528
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,750
'This is our report on the accident,' he said.

529
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,170
'And this is the police report.

530
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:15,480
I can give you copies of these, but perhaps
you'd like to ask me some questions first.'

531
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,390
Tom thought for a moment.

532
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:24,950
'Mr Pennington,' he said, 'I think I saw Angela
yesterday.'

533
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,910
Pennington stared at Tom.

534
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,559
There was silence in the room.

535
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,610
Pennington looked down at his desk, then he
looked at Tom again.

536
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:42,260
Tom was able to hear the noise of the traffic
in the street outside the gardens.

537
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,359
For a long time Pennington said nothing.

538
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,320
At last he spoke.

539
00:36:51,320 --> 00:37:00,010
'Mr Smith,' he said, 'I don't think you fully
understand.

540
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,480
Your fiance...'

541
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,840
'I know,' Tom interrupted.

542
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,660
'Angela was killed in a road accident last
weekend.

543
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,330
Her funeral was last Wednesday.

544
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,980
Mr Diinya told me that this morning.

545
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,990
But I'm telling you I saw her yesterday.'

546
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:25,390
'Mr Smith, I think you should read these reports
carefully before you say anything more.'

547
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,960
He passed the files over to Tom.

548
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,980
'Can I get you a cup of tea or something?'

549
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,910
'A cup of tea would be nice.

550
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,540
Thank you.'

551
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,780
Pennington left the office.

552
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,500
He came back a few minutes later with some
tea.

553
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,950
There was silence in the room while Tom read
the reports.

554
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,400
Presently he looked up.

555
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:58,839
'After the accident,' Tom asked Pennington,
'how did they identify the body?'

556
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:02,440
'That was difficult,' said Pennington.

557
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:09,080
'As you know, the accident happened on a dangerous
road about 200 kilometres from here.

558
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:16,559
Your fiance's car crashed through a wall by
the side of the road, and fell down the hillside.

559
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:21,359
The car burst into flames and was completely
burned out.

560
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:29,569
The - the body was very badly burned, so identification
was difficult.

561
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:35,470
But the police found your fiance's handbag
lying near the car.

562
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,270
Her passport and papers were in the handbag.

563
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:44,480
The police found out that the car was owned
by a car hire company.

564
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,549
Miss Thomson had hired the car for the weekend.'

565
00:38:47,549 --> 00:38:50,630
'What about Angela's parents?'

566
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,400
Tom asked.

567
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,579
'I'm afraid her parents don't know about the
accident yet.

568
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:01,480
They're on a camping holiday in France - the
police are trying to contact them.'

569
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,470
'What was she doing on that dangerous road?'

570
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,970
'She spent the weekend in Bursa, sightseeing.

571
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,970
It's a very interesting old town.

572
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,109
She was on her way back to Istanbul.'

573
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:17,779
Tom thought for a moment.

574
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:22,289
'And are the police quite satisfied?'

575
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,680
Tom asked.

576
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,770
'Yes,' said Pennington.

577
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,059
'The police are convinced that it was an accident.

578
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:31,819
The file is closed.'

579
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:40,440
'And you people at the Consulate,' said Tom
quietly, 'are you satisfied?'

580
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,380
For a moment Pennington said nothing.

581
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,770
'Yes, Mr Smith, we are,' he said.

582
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:58,700
'Our job, among other things, is to look after
British citizens in Turkey.

583
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,869
We have looked into this matter very carefully.

584
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:07,420
And we are satisfied that it was an accident.'

585
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,799
Tom said nothing.

586
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:13,300
'I really am very sorry,' Pennington went
on.

587
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,599
'I understand how you must feel.

588
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,359
You've had a terrible shock.

589
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,520
My advice to you now is to leave Istanbul.

590
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,580
There is nothing you can do here.'

591
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,299
'I'm beginning to think you're right,' said
Tom.

592
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:32,520
'Perhaps I should go home.

593
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:39,039
You know, I really thought I saw Angela, but
now...'

594
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,029
'Where are you staying?' asked Pennington.

595
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:47,010
'The Ankara Hotel, near Taksim Square.'

596
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,950
'Will you be all right?

597
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,750
Do you know anyone here?'

598
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,550
'I'm all right, thank you.

599
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,349
I have a friend here.'

600
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:02,200
'Well Mr Smith, please think carefully about
what I've said.

601
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,750
I hope you'll take my advice.

602
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,440
If you need anything before you leave, contact
me.

603
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,440
I'll be glad to help you.'

604
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,470
'Thank you,' said Tom, standing up.

605
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,549
'Thank you for all you've done.'

606
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,549
'Not at all,' said Pennington.

607
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:18,650
'I'm sorry your visit to Istanbul wasn't a
happier one.

608
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,240
Have a good journey home.

609
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Goodbye.'

610
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,520
The two men shook hands and Tom left the Consulate.

611
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:47,990
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Man in the Grey Raincoat

612
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:53,819
Kemal was waiting in the car outside the Consulate
gates.

613
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:56,640
'What did he say?'

614
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,039
Kemal asked, as Tom got in the car.

615
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,220
'The same as Diinya,' Tom replied.

616
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,079
'It was an accident.

617
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:06,519
Angela's dead.

618
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:07,640
The file is closed.'

619
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,079
Kemal started the car, and drove away from
the Consulate.

620
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,779
'Mr Pennington advised me to go back to London,'
Tom continued.

621
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:23,020
'I'm beginning to think he's right.'

622
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,880
Kemal said nothing.

623
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,280
'The police think Angela is dead, and the
people at the Consulate do too.

624
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,599
I'm the only person who doesn't think she's
dead.

625
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,260
So what am I going to do?

626
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,920
Stay here in Istanbul?

627
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,260
Go home?

628
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,920
Really, I just don't...'

629
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,730
'Now wait a minute, wait a minute, Tom,' said
Kemal.

630
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,480
'How long have you been in Istanbul?'

631
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,250
'Not very long...'

632
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,380
'You've been here less than twenty-four hours.

633
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,020
And what has happened to you in this time?

634
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,980
You've had a terrible shock.

635
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:10,210
You've been told that your fiance was killed
in an accident a week ago.

636
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,700
But you are sure you saw her from the bus
last night.

637
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,910
So now you are confused and you don't know
what to do.

638
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:21,079
That's right, isn't it?'

639
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,730
Tom nodded his head slowly in agreement.

640
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,430
'Well, I'll tell you what you're going to
do,' Kemal went on.

641
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,819
'You're going to come with me to the Topkapi
Palace.

642
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:40,079
We can walk through the beautiful gardens
there and think about everything carefully.

643
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,069
Then we can decide what to do next.'

644
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:45,310
Tom smiled.

645
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:49,790
'You're right, of course.

646
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,650
It has been a difficult day.'

647
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,369
'Exactly,' said Kemal.

648
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:56,869
'Now it's time to relax a little.'

649
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:03,869
They were driving down narrow streets, to
the Golden Horn.

650
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:09,950
'This is the Galata Bridge - it crosses the
Golden Horn,' said Kemal.

651
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,970
'Look, isn't it beautiful?'

652
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,819
They drove slowly across the bridge in the
bright sunlight.

653
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:23,099
'It is beautiful,' said Tom, looking out across
the Bosphorus.

654
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,750
'Very beautiful.'

655
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:32,880
They continued across the bridge, turned left,
and drove past the Railway Station.

656
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,500
A few minutes later they came to Santa Sophia
- one of the oldest and most beautiful buildings

657
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,760
in Istanbul.

658
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:47,130
It was once a church, then a mosque and now
it is a museum.

659
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,950
'We'll leave the car here,' said Kemal.

660
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,380
'First, I'm going to show you the Palace of
Topkapi.'

661
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,380
They got out of the car in a large park.

662
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,750
They were standing in front of the first gate
of the Palace.

663
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:09,730
'The Sultans of Turkey used to live in Topkapi
Palace,' Kemal explained.

664
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,069
Kemal and Tom bought an entrance ticket.

665
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:16,809
They walked through the gate into the gardens
of the Palace.

666
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:23,130
'This is the first courtyard of the Palace,'
went on Kemal.

667
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,299
'Over there are the royal kitchens.

668
00:45:26,299 --> 00:45:31,670
And over there the harem - that's part of
the Palace where the women lived.'

669
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,019
They were walking down a wide path.

670
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:40,089
Kemal looked round and then he took Tom by
the arm.

671
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:41,599
'Walk a little faster,' he said quietly.

672
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,320
Tom saw that there was a strange look on Kemal's
face.

673
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,180
'Is anything wrong?' he asked.

674
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,530
'Keep walking,' said Kemal.

675
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,609
'And don't look back.'

676
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,869
They walked across the courtyard towards the
second gate of the Palace.

677
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:05,210
'Kemal, what's wrong?' said Tom quickly.

678
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:10,290
'Someone is following us,' answered Kemal.

679
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,740
Someone following us?' said Tom.

680
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,799
'What do you mean?'

681
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:19,000
There's a man in a grey raincoat walking behind
us.

682
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,230
I saw him when we came into the Palace.

683
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:26,839
I wasn't sure at first, but I'm sure now.'

684
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,430
They walked on and then ran through the second
gateway.

685
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,430
Kemal looked back.

686
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,140
The man was still following them.

687
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,470
'This way.

688
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,470
Quickly.'

689
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,349
Kemal led Tom to the entrance of the Treasury.

690
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:48,130
Inside, it was very crowded and it was also
dark after the bright sunshine.

691
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,380
'We're going to separate now,' said Kemal.

692
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,490
'The man won't be able to follow both of us.

693
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,779
You take a taxi back to your hotel.

694
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:00,420
Have you got some money?'

695
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,000
'Yes,' said Tom.

696
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,819
'Right, I'll phone you this evening.'

697
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:08,589
'What are you going to do?' asked Tom.

698
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:11,410
'I'm going back to my car.'

699
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,180
'Be careful,' said Tom.

700
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,180
'You too,' said Kemal.

701
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:24,460
'See you later.'

702
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:34,480
CHAPTER EIGHT
A Surprise Phone Call

703
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,019
It was seven o'clock when Tom arrived in Taksim
Square.

704
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:46,380
He got out of the taxi and walked towards
his hotel.

705
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,799
He felt nervous.

706
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:49,920
Was someone watching him?

707
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,180
Was someone sitting in a car watching his
hotel?

708
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,880
He hurried inside.

709
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,100
'Good evening,' said the woman at reception.

710
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,420
'Good evening,' said Tom.

711
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,750
He took his room key and went upstairs.

712
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:12,400
He locked his door, took off his shoes and
lay down on the bed.

713
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,930
He felt tired, but nervous and excited at
the same time.

714
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:24,269
For a long time he lay on the bed, listening
to the noises in the street outside, and thinking

715
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:26,730
about one person - Angela.

716
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,800
The phone rang.

717
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,551
It rang loudly, and Tom jumped nervously.

718
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,069
Kemal, he thought, and picked up the receiver.

719
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:36,089
'Yes?'

720
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:46,059
'This is reception, Mr Smith, I have a call
for you.'

721
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,661
'Thank you,' said Tom.

722
00:48:47,661 --> 00:48:48,661
'Hello?

723
00:48:48,661 --> 00:48:49,661
Is that Tom Smith?'

724
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:55,119
It was a woman's voice.

725
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,119
'Yes.

726
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:57,740
Who is that?'

727
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,059
Tom asked.

728
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,900
His heart was beating fast.

729
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,940
'You don't know me, Mr Smith, but I'm a friend
of Angela's.

730
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,509
I have something to tell you.

731
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,549
Can we meet somewhere?'

732
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:11,660
'Who are you?'

733
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,470
'My name's Julie.

734
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,529
As I said, I'm a friend of Angela's.

735
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:19,990
Listen, I don't want to talk on the phone.

736
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,069
Can we meet somewhere?'

737
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:26,920
'Yes, yes, sure,' said Tom, thinking quickly.

738
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,210
'Do you know the American Bar at the Park
Hotel?'

739
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,450
'I know it.

740
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,930
I'll be there in twenty minutes.'

741
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:40,460
There was a click and then there was silence.

742
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,210
Tom put the phone down and jumped to his feet.

743
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:48,200
'I must tell Kemal,' he said to himself.

744
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,490
He picked up the phone.

745
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,490
'Reception?

746
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:56,569
Can I have Istanbul 36 82 45?'

747
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:58,849
Tom waited impatiently.

748
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:06,940
'Sorry, sir, there's no answer,' said the
woman at reception.

749
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,740
'OK, I'll try later.'

750
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:14,529
Tom put the phone down, and left the room.

751
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:20,350
There were only a few people in the American
Bar when Tom went in.

752
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,509
He sat down at a table by a window.

753
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:28,490
From there he could see everyone who came
through the door.

754
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:33,530
Tom sat drinking a beer and watching the door.

755
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,530
Who was Julie?

756
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,559
What did she want?

757
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,809
Tom would soon find out.

758
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:43,789
A girl came in a few minutes later.

759
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:46,680
She had long blonde hair, and was wearing
jeans.

760
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,220
The girl looked round the bar, then walked
over to Tom's table.

761
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,920
'Hi,' she said.

762
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,900
'I'm Julie.'

763
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,460
'Hello,' he said.

764
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,530
'I'm Tom.

765
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,140
Please sit down.'

766
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,970
She sat down.

767
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,320
The waiter came over.

768
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,009
'Would you like a drink?' said Tom.

769
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:13,549
'A coffee, please,' she said.

770
00:51:13,549 --> 00:51:15,559
The waiter nodded and left.

771
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:19,150
'So you're Tom,' Julie said.

772
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,980
'You look just like your photograph.

773
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,890
Angela showed me a picture of you.'

774
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,660
'But how did you find me?'

775
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,950
Tom asked.

776
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:33,770
'I went to the British Consulate today,' Julie
explained.

777
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,260
'I spoke to Mr Pennington; he told me the
name of your hotel.

778
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:44,220
I knew you were coming to Istanbul and I wanted
to speak to you.'

779
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,640
She looked round nervously.

780
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,660
'Listen, Tom,' she went on.

781
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,259
'There's something strange going on.

782
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:56,460
What do you know about Angela's accident?'

783
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:02,730
'Only what the Consulate told me today,' said
Tom.

784
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,890
He told Julie about his conversation with
Mr Pennington.

785
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,390
'And are you satisfied?'

786
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,390
she asked.

787
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,609
Tom looked at her.

788
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:16,220
'Tell me what you think,' he said slowly.

789
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,730
'All right,' said Julie.

790
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:23,930
'Let's start at the beginning.

791
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,460
Angela came to Istanbul two months ago.

792
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:33,690
I met her at a party soon after she arrived
and we became good friends.

793
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,450
At the beginning, she was happy.

794
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:41,869
She enjoyed her job, she liked working for
her boss...'

795
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:42,869
'Diinya?'

796
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:44,579
'That's right.

797
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,150
Everything was fine.

798
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,500
I saw her quite often.

799
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,869
We used to have lunch together, and go sightseeing.

800
00:52:53,869 --> 00:53:00,180
And then, two weeks ago something happened.

801
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,380
Angela seemed worried about something - something
to do with her work.

802
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:11,970
I asked her what was wrong but she didn't
want to talk about it.

803
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:18,250
Then one lunch-time we were together in a
restaurant and suddenly Diinya came in.

804
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,270
The moment she saw him, she became nervous.

805
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,270
I think she was afraid of him.'

806
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,270
'Go on,' Tom said.

807
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:29,380
'Well, I don't know anything else.

808
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:35,609
She never told me what she was worried about.

809
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:44,260
I saw her a few more times, and then she had
the accident.'

810
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,410
She looked at Tom.

811
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:49,440
'But it is strange, isn't it?'

812
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,069
Julie went on.

813
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:58,119
'She was worried about something - her job,
or her boss, or something.

814
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,609
But she wouldn't talk about it.

815
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:01,490
And then she had an accident.'

816
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:02,490
She stopped.

817
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,970
'That's all,' she said.

818
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,440
'That's what I wanted to tell you.'

819
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Tom leant across the table.

820
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:18,509
'Shall I tell you something?' he said quietly.

821
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:30,470
'Yesterday, on the way into Istanbul, I saw
her.'

822
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,700
Julie stared at him.

823
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,300
'Where?'

824
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,599
she asked.

825
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,690
'I was in the airport bus, coming into the
city.

826
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:45,140
We were in Millet Street near Aksaray.

827
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,290
Angela was going into a building with two
men.'

828
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:52,109
'What do you mean, going into a building?

829
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:53,940
Which building?'

830
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,589
'Well, I don't know.

831
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:04,509
There are a lot of offices in the building.

832
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,509
I went there today.

833
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,460
There was a dentist, and a doctor...'

834
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,300
'Doctor,' said Julie.

835
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,530
'That's interesting.'

836
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,990
'What do you mean?'

837
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:19,130
'Angela had a virus two weeks ago - a bad
attack.

838
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,220
She was getting pills from a doctor.

839
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:28,059
That explains it - she needed more pills,
or treatment.

840
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:31,960
She was going to a doctor!'

841
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,710
Tom thought for a moment.

842
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:38,269
'So that's where she was going,' he said.

843
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:39,599
'To the doctor's.

844
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,050
Maybe I can go and ask the doctor a few questions.'

845
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,069
Julie looked worried.

846
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:49,950
'Be careful, Tom,' she said.

847
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,700
'What do you mean?'

848
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,130
'Just be careful,' she repeated.

849
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,559
'Something strange is happening.

850
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,869
It could be dangerous for you if you ask too
many questions.'

851
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,599
'OK,' said Tom.

852
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,473
'But I'm sure Angela is in this city somewhere.

853
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:10,473
She's in trouble.

854
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:17,980
The police and the Consulate say she's dead,
so they won't help.

855
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,970
But I think she's alive.

856
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:26,329
She's in Istanbul somewhere, and I'm not leaving
until I find her!'

857
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:43,230
CHAPTER NINE
'Goodbye, Mr Diinya'

858
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,950
Later that evening Tom phoned Kemal.

859
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,680
He told him about his meeting with Julie.

860
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,299
Kemal listened while Tom explained what had
happened.

861
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:01,980
'OK,' he said, when Tom had finished.

862
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,249
'Listen - I think I understand what's happening.

863
00:57:06,249 --> 00:57:08,710
Angela was working for Diinya.

864
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,710
Right?'

865
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:10,710
'Yes.'

866
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:17,260
'And then she was worried about something
- something at work.

867
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,809
Right?'

868
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,359
'Yes.'

869
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:31,200
'OK, and then she had her accident.

870
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:38,940
But it wasn't an accident.

871
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,770
Tom - you know what I think?

872
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:52,600
I think Angela is alive.

873
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,960
She's here somewhere in Istanbul.

874
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,520
Diinya is holding her prisoner.'

875
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,339
'What?'

876
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:07,640
'Think about it, Tom.

877
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:20,410
Angela was worried about something at work.

878
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:47,559
We think it was something to do with Diinya
and his export business.

879
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:57,690
And now she has disappeared.

880
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:28,749
But she isn't dead - there was no car accident
- Diinya is holding her prisoner, I'm sure

881
00:59:28,749 --> 00:59:34,099
of it.'

882
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:42,130
'But,' began Tom.

883
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:47,490
'I don't...'

884
00:59:47,490 --> 01:00:18,110
'Listen, Tom,' continued Kemal, 'what about
the man in the Topkapi Palace today - the

885
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:21,849
man who followed us?

886
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:27,460
You know what I think, Tom?

887
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:41,119
I think Diinya and his friends have been watching
you since you arrived in Istanbul.

888
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:57,020
They know where you are staying, they know
you went to the Consulate, and that's how

889
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:02,859
they followed us to the Palace today.

890
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:07,319
They know everything about you, Tom.'

891
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:10,859
'God,' said Tom quietly.

892
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:17,059
'My God, Kemal, I think you're right.

893
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:20,599
You must be right.

894
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:27,549
But what are we going to do now?'

895
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:32,750
'I'll tell you,' said Kemal.

896
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:52,450
'They know where you are staying and they
know you're looking for Angela.

897
01:01:52,450 --> 01:02:00,119
That's why they're watching you.

898
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:09,290
They want to find out what you do next.

899
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:23,099
Well, I'll tell you what you're going to do
next.

900
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:29,150
You're going to leave Istanbul.

901
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,569
Now listen...'

902
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:39,820
Next morning, Tom checked out of his hotel.

903
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:48,819
'Thank you,' he said to the receptionist,
'and goodbye.'

904
01:02:48,819 --> 01:02:51,140
'Leaving Istanbul?'

905
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,789
'Yes, I'm going home.'

906
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:58,119
'Goodbye, sir.

907
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,759
Have a good journey.'

908
01:03:02,759 --> 01:03:10,900
Tom took a taxi to Diinya's office.

909
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,490
The driver stopped outside.

910
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:17,720
'Wait here, please,' said Tom.

911
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,270
'I'll be back in a few minutes.'

912
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,380
He went into the office.

913
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:30,170
'Good morning,' he said to the secretary.

914
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,570
'Is Mr Diinya here?

915
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:38,859
I've come to say goodbye.'

916
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:47,920
She went to the office.

917
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:57,330
Mr Diinya came out.

918
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:04,380
'Ah, Mr Smith.'

919
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:13,790
'Good morning, Mr Diinya.

920
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:19,569
I've come to say goodbye.'

921
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:20,890
'Leaving so soon?'

922
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,890
'Yes.

923
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:27,009
I went to the British Consulate yesterday
and spoke to Mr Pennington.

924
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:32,190
It seems there's nothing I can do here.

925
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:35,499
I'm going back to London.

926
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:38,910
Thank you for your help.'

927
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:42,579
'You're welcome, Mr Smith.

928
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:49,099
Once again, I'm very sorry about your fiance.

929
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:57,960
I'm sorry your visit to Istanbul wasn't a
happy one.'

930
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:05,180
'Thank you and goodbye.

931
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:12,309
My plane leaves at midday.'

932
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:15,730
'At midday?

933
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,160
I see.

934
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:24,289
Goodbye, Mr Smith.

935
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:31,150
Have a good journey.'

936
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,359
The two men shook hands.

937
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,490
Tom turned and left the office.

938
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,859
His taxi was waiting.

939
01:05:38,859 --> 01:05:44,200
'The airport, please,' he said as he got in.

940
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,009
The taxi moved off.

941
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:57,630
Another car, parked twenty metres away, moved
away from the pavement and started following.

942
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:06,060
At the airport, Tom walked over to the British
Airways desk.

943
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:13,160
He asked about the flight to London, but he
did not check in.

944
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:19,240
Then he bought a newspaper and sat down to
wait.

945
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:24,869
He looked round the busy airport.

946
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:39,650
Somewhere among all these people, he thought,
someone is watching me.

947
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:49,060
He opened his newspaper and started reading.

948
01:06:49,060 --> 01:07:07,039
Then there was an announcement over the loudspeaker:
'British Airways announce the departure of

949
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,739
their flight TK979 for London.

950
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:17,400
Will Passengers please proceed to Gate 6 for
boarding.'

951
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:24,799
Tom picked up his things and walked towards
passport control.

952
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,500
There were lots of people at the entrance
to passport control.

953
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:35,440
Tom went into the crowd of people and moved
towards a large man whose relatives were saying

954
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,440
goodbye.

955
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:41,810
Suddenly he turned and went into the men's
toilet.

956
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:53,529
In the toilet he took off his jacket and started
to wash his hands and face.

957
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:58,259
No one followed him into the toilet.

958
01:07:58,259 --> 01:08:05,029
Then there was another announcement: British
Airways Flight TK979 for London.

959
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:08,670
This is the final announcement.

960
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:14,509
Will passengers please proceed immediately
to Gate 6.

961
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:18,160
This gate is now closing.'

962
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:23,270
Tom heard the announcement but didn't move.

963
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:29,839
He looked at his watch, and smiled to himself.

964
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:43,620
The man in the grey raincoat walked over to
the telephone kiosks and dialed a number.

965
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,660
'Hello?

966
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,850
I saw him leave.

967
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:54,090
Yes - he's on the plane.'

968
01:08:54,090 --> 01:09:24,540
The man put the phone down and walked away
towards the exit.

969
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:50,320
Half an hour later, Tom was in a taxi on his
way to Kemal's flat in Sisli.

970
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:59,270
Kemal opened the door.

971
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:05,030
'Hello, Tom,' he smiled.

972
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:07,910
'Everything OK?'

973
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:13,680
'No problem,' smiled Tom.

974
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,890
'I went into the crowd at passport control.

975
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:29,200
Then I hid in the toilet at the last minute.'

976
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,030
'Well done.

977
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:47,870
Diinya and his friends will think you have
gone back to London.

978
01:10:47,870 --> 01:11:00,040
Now you can stay here in my flat and we can
start looking for Angela.'

979
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:05,590
'And we know where to start, don't we?'

980
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:09,060
'Yes - Diinya's office,' replied Kemal.

981
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,530
CHAPTER TEN
An Important Discovery

982
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:24,270
Kemal and Tom had something to eat.

983
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:45,770
Then they sat down and made their plans for
the evening.

984
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:57,140
'We'll watch Diinya's office this evening,'
said Kemal.

985
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:03,980
'When he comes out we'll follow him.

986
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:10,090
Then we'll find out where he lives.'

987
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:17,100
'Won't that be dangerous for me?' asked Tom.

988
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,610
'He knows me, remember.

989
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:24,990
What if he sees me?'

990
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:28,840
Kemal smiled and stood up.

991
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,040
'I've thought about that.

992
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:40,080
And I've got just what you need.

993
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,080
Look.'

994
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,620
Kemal opened a drawer.

995
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:45,810
'Put this on,' he said.

996
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:51,750
'A wig!' said Tom.

997
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:57,790
'And a false moustache, too.

998
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:05,220
Go on, try them on.'

999
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:14,360
Tom put on the wig and moustache.

1000
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:19,520
He looked in the mirror.

1001
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,580
'No one will recognise me now,' he laughed.

1002
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:28,830
'Not even my own mother!'

1003
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:32,190
'Good,' said Kemal.

1004
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:49,080
'And if you also wear dark glasses you will
be completely disguised.'

1005
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:56,920
It was seven o'clock and the shops and small
businesses in the quiet street were closing.

1006
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,970
Tom and Kemal sat in the car, waiting patiently.

1007
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:05,940
'He'll be leaving soon,' said Tom.

1008
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:23,440
Further down the street, they could see the
entrance to Diinya's office.

1009
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,770
They sat in silence, watching.

1010
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,380
Time passed slowly.

1011
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:40,570
Ten past seven, quarter past, then suddenly
- 'There he is,' whispered Tom.

1012
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,560
'That's him.'

1013
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:54,660
Diinya came out of his office and locked the
door carefully behind him.

1014
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,840
He looked along the street.

1015
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,720
Then walked over to a grey Mercedes car and
got in.

1016
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,890
The Mercedes moved away from the pavement
and drove along the street.

1017
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,750
It turned right onto the main road.

1018
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:14,690
'Let's go,' said Kemal and drove down the
street.

1019
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:18,110
They turned right, following the Mercedes.

1020
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:24,700
The main road was busy, and they drove along
in the traffic.

1021
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,330
'There it is,' said Kemal.

1022
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:30,230
'About fifty metres away, in front of that
taxi.'

1023
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,580
'Careful,' said Tom.

1024
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,460
'Don't drive too close.

1025
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,340
Stay behind the taxi.'

1026
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:43,830
They drove along the main road, watching the
Mercedes.

1027
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,990
'He's turning left.'

1028
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,990
'OK.'

1029
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,200
Tom and Kemal followed.

1030
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:56,960
They were now driving along the wide street
beside the sea.

1031
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:05,300
For twenty minutes they drove towards the
suburbs of the city.

1032
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:11,240
Now they were outside the city centre and
the traffic was moving faster.

1033
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,430
The Mercedes turned off the main road.

1034
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:16,670
'Slow down,' said Tom.

1035
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:19,100
'You're too near.'

1036
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:28,000
They slowed down until the Mercedes had turned
the corner, then drove faster.

1037
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,800
When they turned the corner, the road was
empty.

1038
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,540
'Damn,' said Kemal, and drove faster.

1039
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:44,250
They crossed another side street, and looked
quickly right and left.

1040
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:47,080
'Left,' said Tom.

1041
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,910
'There he is!'

1042
01:16:49,910 --> 01:17:00,280
They turned and drove along a quiet street
of private villas.

1043
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:08,870
This was the most dangerous part because there
was not much traffic.

1044
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:21,200
If Diinya looked round now, he would see that
someone was following him...

1045
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:28,070
'He's stopping,' said Kemal, as he saw the
Mercedes' brake lights going on.

1046
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,540
Kemal drove slowly.

1047
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:36,890
The Mercedes was now fifty metres in front
of them.

1048
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,120
'He's turning,' said Kemal.

1049
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:53,610
The Mercedes turned off the street and drove
through the gates of a large villa.

1050
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:58,560
The villa was surrounded by trees and bushes.

1051
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:08,380
Already the gates were closing behind it as
the Mercedes drove up to the house.

1052
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:16,620
Tom and Kemal drove past the closed gate and
continued along the street.

1053
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,810
'Well,' said Tom.

1054
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:24,070
'That's where Diinya lives.'

1055
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:29,400
'That's a start,' said Kemal.

1056
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:35,790
'Come on, let's go home now.'

1057
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:46,440
Back in Kemal's flat, they discussed what
they had seen.

1058
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:51,340
'I think that Angela is in the villa,' said
Tom.

1059
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,370
Kemal agreed.

1060
01:18:54,370 --> 01:19:04,980
'What do we do now?' asked Tom.

1061
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:11,690
'We can't get into the villa.

1062
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:14,690
There are probably men guarding it.'

1063
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,690
'I agree,' said Kemal.

1064
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:32,330
'We think she's in the villa but we can't
get in there.'

1065
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,680
'It doesn't matter.

1066
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,390
The villa isn't important,' said Tom.

1067
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:42,530
'What do you mean?'

1068
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:46,450
'Think about it,' Tom replied.

1069
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:49,590
'Remember what Julie said.

1070
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:55,080
Angela was worried about something at work.

1071
01:19:55,080 --> 01:20:03,970
She worked in the office, she never went to
the villa.

1072
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:17,740
So what we're looking for is in the office.

1073
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:21,580
The villa isn't important.'

1074
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:25,410
'You're right,' said Kemal.

1075
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:30,870
He stood up and walked over to the window.

1076
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:35,790
'Listen, you've been inside the office, what's
it like?'

1077
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:53,320
'When you go in the door,' Tom told him, 'there's
the window, and a small reception desk.

1078
01:20:53,320 --> 01:21:03,990
Then there's an office, and a door to Diinya's
private office at the back.'

1079
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,450
'Anything else?'

1080
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:11,380
Tom tried to remember the inside of the office.

1081
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,270
'Yes,' he said.

1082
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:17,540
'There's a door, another door, at the back.'

1083
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,220
'OK,' said Kemal.

1084
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:25,380
'They must have a workshop or a store through
that door.

1085
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:30,620
That's where they'll keep all the things they
export.

1086
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:36,260
So somehow we have to have a look inside...'

1087
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,360
Kemal thought for a moment.

1088
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:43,690
'I've got an idea,' he said suddenly.

1089
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:47,150
'Diinya exports onyx ornaments to England.

1090
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:54,920
My parents sell things like that in their
shop.

1091
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:09,580
So, if I had a box of ornaments and I wanted
to sell them very cheaply, who would buy them

1092
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,910
from me?'

1093
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:15,660
Tom looked at him, then smiled.

1094
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,090
'Diinya,' he said.

1095
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:22,510
'Exactly,' smiled Kemal.

1096
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:27,080
'Now, let's think carefully...'

1097
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:31,760
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A Clever Trick

1098
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:38,190
Ibrahim Diinya was alone in his private office.

1099
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:45,570
He was working at his desk, finishing some
paperwork.

1100
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:54,700
He always did his paperwork alone before going
home.

1101
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,930
He looked at his watch.

1102
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:02,130
Another ten minutes, then he would be finished.

1103
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:07,750
There was a knock at the door.

1104
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:12,860
Diinya looked up from his papers.

1105
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,900
He didn't move.

1106
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:19,050
There was another knock, louder this time.

1107
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:27,380
He put the papers in his desk and locked it.

1108
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:37,800
Then he got up and went out into the office.

1109
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:46,620
He could see a man outside, standing in the
doorway.

1110
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:54,680
'We're closed,' he said through the glass
door.

1111
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,590
'Come back tomorrow.'

1112
01:23:57,590 --> 01:24:02,440
'I'm sorry,' said the man.

1113
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,350
'It's urgent, please.'

1114
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,250
Diinya was annoyed.

1115
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:13,180
He unlocked the door and opened it.

1116
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,210
'We're closed.

1117
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:18,260
Can't you see?'

1118
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:26,390
'I'm very sorry to bother you,' said Kemal.

1119
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:34,530
'But I was hoping to find someone here.

1120
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:38,590
I have a problem.

1121
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:45,710
You see, I need some money quickly.

1122
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:52,010
I must have it tomorrow morning, early.

1123
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:58,510
It's for well, it doesn't matter why I need
the money.

1124
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,290
That's my problem.

1125
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:20,400
But I have some onyx ornaments to sell and
I heard you would be interested.'

1126
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:25,570
He held out a beautiful onyx ashtray.

1127
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:33,120
'Would you be interested in buying fifty of
these?'

1128
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:44,402
Diinya took the ashtray and looked at it carefully.

1129
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:48,270
Kemal could see he was interested.

1130
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:52,130
'Very good quality,' said Kemal.

1131
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:55,330
'Fifty, did you say?'

1132
01:25:55,330 --> 01:25:58,050
'That's right.

1133
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:04,860
They're in the car outside.'

1134
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,610
'How much do you want?'

1135
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,610
Diinya asked.

1136
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:10,710
'15,000 lira for fifty,' said Kemal.

1137
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:14,050
'That's too much,' said Diinya.

1138
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:17,750
'I'll give you 5000.'

1139
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:23,500
'Please - I need the money urgently,' said
Kemal.

1140
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,900
'Then you will accept 5000,' said Diinya.

1141
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,980
Kemal looked disappointed.

1142
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:31,360
'All right.'

1143
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,740
he said.

1144
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:37,580
'You can have them for 6000 lira.

1145
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:43,110
They're in a big box in the car.

1146
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:47,260
Could you help me carry them?

1147
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,340
They're very heavy.'

1148
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:53,160
Diinya went with him to the car.

1149
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,360
Together they carried the box into the office.

1150
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:05,800
'This is really very kind of you,' said Kemal.

1151
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,200
'They are heavy.'

1152
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:16,690
They carried the box to the back of the office.

1153
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:21,890
Kemal looked quickly at the door.

1154
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:28,770
'Have you got a store somewhere?' he asked.

1155
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:36,200
'I'm sure you don't want the box in your office.'

1156
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,370
Diinya thought for a moment.

1157
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,700
He looked at the large box in his small office
and said, 'One moment.'

1158
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:49,030
He took a key from his pocket and unlocked
the door.

1159
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:59,640
They picked up the box and carried it through
into the workshop.

1160
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:06,310
It was a long, wide room, with windows on
one side.

1161
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:18,930
There were a lot of articles in the room - onyx
tables, lamps, ornaments, brass and leather

1162
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:19,930
articles.

1163
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:30,890
On a workbench, there were rows of tools and
cutting equipment.

1164
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:37,240
'This is fine,' said Diinya.

1165
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,040
'Put it down here.'

1166
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,340
They put down the box.

1167
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,700
Diinya took out his wallet.

1168
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,190
'6000 lira,' he said.

1169
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:58,040
At that moment the telephone in his office
rang.

1170
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,000
Diinya looked annoyed.

1171
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:12,140
'Excuse me one moment,' he said to Kemal.

1172
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:25,060
He went back to his private office.

1173
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:41,700
Kemal looked at his watch and smiled as Diinya
disappeared through the door.

1174
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:47,450
Quickly he looked round the workshop.

1175
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:50,820
There was a door at the other end.

1176
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:54,760
He looked out of the windows.

1177
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:08,150
Outside there was a small courtyard, and at
one end of the courtyard, a wall, two metres

1178
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:09,150
high.

1179
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:15,520
On the workbench at the end of the workshop,
there were several onyx table lamps.

1180
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,760
Kemal looked quickly at them.

1181
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,450
They had been cut in half with a cutting instrument.

1182
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:19,500
The inside had been removed.

1183
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,500
Kemal looked closely.

1184
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,930
Suddenly Kemal heard Diinya say goodbye.

1185
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:25,250
He turned quickly away from the workbench.

1186
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:31,230
'Sorry to keep you waiting,' Diinya said as
he came back in.

1187
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:35,020
'Not at all,' said Kemal.

1188
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:41,090
'I can see you're a very busy man.'

1189
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,890
Diinya counted out 6000 lira.

1190
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:47,920
'Thank you,' said Kemal.

1191
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:51,720
'I really need this money.

1192
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:58,560
Well, I won't take any more of your time.'

1193
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,520
Diinya walked with him to the door into the
street.

1194
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,160
'Thanks again,' said Kemal.

1195
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,160
'Goodnight.'

1196
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,200
'Goodnight,' said Diinya, and closed the door.

1197
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,550
Kemal went back to his car and drove home.

1198
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,550
Tom was waiting for him.

1199
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:10,550
'Did it work?' he asked, as Kemal came into
the apartment.

1200
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:11,550
'Perfectly,' smiled Kemal.

1201
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,550
'My brother phoned just at the right moment,
when we were in the workshop.

1202
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:13,550
Diinya believed my story, too.

1203
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:14,550
And he gave me a very low price for the onyx.'

1204
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:15,550
'What did you see in the workshop?'

1205
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:18,130
Kemal looked serious.

1206
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,030
'Well, not very much, I'm afraid.

1207
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:21,030
It's just a workshop, or a store.

1208
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:22,030
There were lots of onyx and leather articles,
brass and tools.

1209
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,030
And there were some onyx lamps being repaired,
I think.

1210
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,030
But there's a courtyard outside, and another
building opposite.

1211
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,030
I'm sure that it belongs to Diinya.

1212
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,030
And more important - there's a wall at one
end of the courtyard, which isn't too high

1213
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,030
'Meaning?'

1214
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,030
'Meaning that it wouldn't be too difficult
to climb over it.'

1215
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:29,030
CHAPTER TWELVE
Disaster!

1216
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,030
The next morning, after breakfast, Tom and
Kemal sat looking at a street map of Istanbul.

1217
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,030
'Look here,' Kemal said.

1218
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,030
He pointed to a small street.

1219
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:33,030
'Diinya's shop is in this street.

1220
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,030
Now, look at the street behind his shop.

1221
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,030
We'll have to find a way into the courtyard
from that side.'

1222
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,680
'Do you know that part of the city?' asked
Tom.

1223
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,950
'Not very well.

1224
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:43,480
As far as I remember, there are only offices,
warehouses and workshops there.

1225
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,030
At night it will be quiet, but we'll have
to be very careful.'

1226
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:47,050
'OK, we'll do it tonight,' said Tom.

1227
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:51,140
They left Kemal's flat in Sisli at ten o'clock
and drove across the city to Diinya's shop.

1228
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:57,980
They parked the car two blocks from the workshop.

1229
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:08,580
There were not many street lights there and
it was dark.

1230
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,020
'Come on,' said Kemal.

1231
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,400
'We must walk from here.'

1232
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,060
They walked along the dark streets.

1233
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:15,710
They were both wearing dark clothes.

1234
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,870
They came to the street which ran behind Diinya's
workshop and courtyard.

1235
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:19,880
'You see?' said Kemal quietly.

1236
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,880
'Only offices, warehouses and workshops - nobody
lives in this street.

1237
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,980
The courtyard must be up this alleyway, behind
these buildings.'

1238
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,590
They looked up and down the dark street.

1239
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:28,490
No cars, no one in sight.

1240
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:29,760
'Let's go,' whispered Kemal.

1241
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,540
They walked quickly up the alleyway.

1242
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:34,570
Tom's heart was beating fast, his mouth dry
with fear.

1243
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:38,030
They stood behind one of the warehouses, beside
the courtyard wall.

1244
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,640
Somewhere in the distance a dog barked.

1245
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,790
'Help me up,' whispered Kemal.

1246
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:41,790
'Quietly!'

1247
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:46,110
Tom stood with his back against the wall.

1248
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:49,450
He held his hands together.

1249
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:56,580
Kemal put his foot in Tom's hands and reached
up.

1250
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,060
'OK,' Kemal whispered.

1251
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:01,010
Kemal looked carefully over the wall.

1252
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:02,980
The courtyard was empty.

1253
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:08,600
Kemal pulled himself up and sat on top of
the wall.

1254
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:16,200
'Give me your hand,' whispered Kemal down
to Tom.

1255
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,570
'I'll pull you up.'

1256
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:24,240
Tom reached up.

1257
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:38,220
Kemal took his hand and pulled.

1258
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,220
Tom put his other hand on the top of the wall
and climbed on to the wall beside Kemal.

1259
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:44,510
Kemal dropped silently to the ground in the
courtyard.

1260
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:45,510
Suddenly there was a noise.

1261
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:46,730
It came from inside the workshop.

1262
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:47,730
Kemal pointed to the side.

1263
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:50,060
They hurried silently over to the wall, and
waited.

1264
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:51,460
Another noise.

1265
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,460
A door opened and closed inside the workshop.

1266
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,460
A light came on in the workshop and shone
out across the courtyard.

1267
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:54,460
Tom and Kemal stood frozen against the wall.

1268
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,460
They expected a door to open and men to run
out into the courtyard.

1269
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:56,460
But nothing happened.

1270
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:00,660
They heard people talking and moving about
inside.

1271
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:05,600
Kemal put his mouth close to Tom's ear.

1272
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,920
'This is our only chance,' he whispered.

1273
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,720
'We have to try to see what they're doing
in there.'

1274
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:15,720
They moved very slowly towards the window.

1275
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,010
It was so quiet that Tom could hear his heart
beating.

1276
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,970
At last they were going to find out what was
happening.

1277
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:22,430
There were some men in the workshop.

1278
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:25,080
One of them was working with an onyx table
lamp.

1279
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,681
The lamp had been cut in half.

1280
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:30,180
He put a small plastic bag inside the lamp.

1281
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:36,090
Then he fixed the two halves of the lamp together
again.

1282
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:39,610
Tom looked at all the onyx and brass ornaments,
the cutting tools, the pile of plastic bags

1283
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:40,610
on the table.

1284
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,750
Suddenly he understood what was happening.

1285
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:45,852
Ornaments for export to England, and inside
the ornaments - opium!

1286
01:34:45,852 --> 01:34:46,852
'So that's it!' he whispered to Kemal.

1287
01:34:46,852 --> 01:34:47,852
'They're smuggling drugs in the ornaments!'

1288
01:34:47,852 --> 01:34:49,680
Tom stepped back from the window.

1289
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,370
Perhaps he was excited by what he had seen.

1290
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,370
Perhaps he forgot where he was.

1291
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,370
But suddenly, he put his foot on a stone and
slipped.

1292
01:34:53,370 --> 01:34:54,370
He put out his hand and knocked against a
piece of wood.

1293
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:55,370
The piece of wood fell to the ground with
a loud crash.

1294
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,370
A light came on, a door opened, and men rushed
out.

1295
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,370
'Run!'

1296
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:58,370
shouted Kemal.

1297
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,370
'Stop!'

1298
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:00,370
shouted a man.

1299
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:01,370
'Catch them!'

1300
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,370
Seconds later, Tom and Kemal were at the wall.

1301
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:03,370
They jumped, but Tom was too slow.

1302
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,370
One of the men caught his legs and pulled
him to the ground.

1303
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:05,370
Kemal turned to help Tom.

1304
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,840
Then it was too late.

1305
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,840
The other men jumped up and pulled him back
into the courtyard.

1306
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,840
A few seconds later it was all over.

1307
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,840
Tom and Kemal were prisoners.

1308
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,840
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Journey Into Danger

1309
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,840
'This way!

1310
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,840
Hurry up!' said one of the men, pushing Tom
and Kemal towards the door of the workshop.

1311
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,840
'Get inside!' said the man.

1312
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,840
Tom and Kemal stepped inside and stopped,
shocked.

1313
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:15,840
Diinya was standing in the workshop.

1314
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:16,840
He had a gun in his hand.

1315
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:17,840
For a few seconds he stared at them silently.

1316
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:18,840
'Well, well,' he said slowly, 'our friend,
the Englishman.

1317
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:19,840
Very clever.

1318
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,840
Oh, yes, very clever.

1319
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,840
And you!'

1320
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,840
His face was red with anger as he looked at
Kemal.

1321
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,840
He stepped forward and hit Kemal in the face.

1322
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,840
Tom moved forward.

1323
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,840
'Don't move, or I'll kill you now,' said Diinya.

1324
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:26,840
The gun was pointing at Tom.

1325
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,840
'Get over there.'

1326
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,840
Tom and Kemal stood beside the workbench.

1327
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,840
Diinya looked at them both for a long moment.

1328
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,840
'So,' he said finally.

1329
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,840
'You have seen all this.'

1330
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,840
He pointed to the plastic bags and the onyx
ornaments.

1331
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,840
'Very clever of you.

1332
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,840
We should have killed the English girl before.

1333
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,840
Then this would never have happened.'

1334
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,840
'Where is she?' asked Tom.

1335
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:37,840
'Where is Angela?'

1336
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:38,840
'Oh, don't worry about her.

1337
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:39,840
She's OK.

1338
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:40,840
Let's say - she is a guest at my villa.

1339
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,840
You'll be able to speak to her very soon - I'm
sure you'll have a lot to talk about - before

1340
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,840
you all die!'

1341
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,840
He laughed - a cold, cruel laugh.

1342
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,840
'OK, let's go, said Diinya to his men.

1343
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,840
'We're taking these two with us.'

1344
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,840
The men pushed Tom and Kemal out of the workshop
and through the shop to the door.

1345
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,840
The Mercedes stood in the street.

1346
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,840
'Get inside,' said Diinya.

1347
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:49,840
Tom looked up and down the street.

1348
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
But there was no one there to help them.

1349
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,840
'Don't try anything foolish, Englishman.

1350
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,840
You can't escape.

1351
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,840
Get in.'

1352
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,840
Tom and Kemal sat in the back of the car,
with a man on each side of them.

1353
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,840
The others got in the front.

1354
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,840
They drove away from the shop, turned on to
the main road, and drove across the city towards

1355
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,840
the suburbs.

1356
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,840
'Take a look,' said Diinya, smiling.

1357
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,840
'Istanbul by night.

1358
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,840
So many people, so much life.

1359
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,840
Take your last look at it, you foolish young
men.

1360
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,840
It's the last time you'll see it.'

1361
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:03,840
'What,' began Tom, 'has Angela got to do with
this?'

1362
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,840
'We needed her at the beginning,' replied
Diinya.

1363
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,840
'She was very useful.

1364
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,840
She helped us to arrange the export of the
things to England.

1365
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:07,840
She didn't know anything about our - our other
business.

1366
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,840
But one day, she left something in the office,
and came back for it in the evening.

1367
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:09,840
Most unfortunate for her.

1368
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,840
She saw what we were doing.

1369
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,840
After that, I could not let her go.'

1370
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,840
'Where is she?' asked Tom urgently.

1371
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,840
'Ah - I'm not a cruel man,' replied Diinya.

1372
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,840
'I did not kill her.

1373
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,840
I have kept her in my villa.'

1374
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,840
'That's because you didn't know what to do,'
said Tom.

1375
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,840
'Exactly.

1376
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,840
But we have no choice now.

1377
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,840
You know too much about us.'

1378
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,840
'What about the drugs when they arrive in
Europe?' asked Tom.

1379
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,840
'That's easy,' replied Diinya.

1380
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,840
'We have friends in England.

1381
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,840
The goods are delivered to dealers in England
and our friends buy them.

1382
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,840
Your fiance helped us a lot.

1383
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,840
I shall soon be rich - very rich.'

1384
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:26,840
The Mercedes turned off the main road, and
drove along the small street towards Diinya's

1385
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,840
villa.

1386
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,840
The car drove in through the gates of the
villa, up to the house.

1387
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:29,840
It stopped near the front door.

1388
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:30,840
It was a big villa with three floors.

1389
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,840
There were steps leading up to the front door.

1390
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,840
'Out,' said Diinya.

1391
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:33,840
They got out of the car.

1392
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,840
There was one small light above the front
door of the villa.

1393
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:35,840
The rest of the house was in complete darkness.

1394
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,840
Tom looked around - he was looking for a way
to escape.

1395
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,840
Diinya saw him.

1396
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,840
'If you try to escape, I'll shoot you,' he
said.

1397
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,840
'Now, get inside.'

1398
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,840
They started walking up the steps to the front
door.

1399
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:41,840
'STOP!'

1400
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,840
shouted a voice.

1401
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,840
Suddenly a blinding light came on.

1402
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,840
The garden of the villa was full of men running
towards them.

1403
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,840
For a second Diinya stood frozen on the steps,
shocked.

1404
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,840
Then he ran towards the door.

1405
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,840
It opened suddenly and two men jumped out.

1406
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,840
They had guns pointing at Diinya.

1407
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,840
'Stop!

1408
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,840
This is the police.

1409
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,840
Stop or we'll shoot!'

1410
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,840
Diinya dropped his gun and slowly put his
hands above his head.

1411
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:53,840
His men did the same.

1412
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,840
'The police,' Kemal said.

1413
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,840
'We're safe.'

1414
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:56,840
At that moment the door of the villa opened
and a girl ran out.

1415
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,840
'Tom!'

1416
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,840
she shouted.

1417
01:36:58,840 --> 01:36:59,840
'Tom!'

1418
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,840
Tom turned round quickly.

1419
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,840
'Angela!'

1420
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:02,840
For a long time they stood, unable to speak,
holding each other.

1421
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:03,840
'Oh, Tom,' said Angela.

1422
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,840
'You're here at last!'

1423
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,840
He looked into her eyes.

1424
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:06,840
'Angela, my love,' he whispered.

1425
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,840
'Are you all right?'

1426
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,840
'Oh, yes, I'm all right.

1427
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,840
I'm fine.

1428
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,840
The police came here to the villa about an
hour ago.

1429
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:11,840
We knew you were coming, the police were following
you.

1430
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,840
Oh, Tom, I was so worried that Diinya would
kill you.'

1431
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,840
She put her arms round him again.

1432
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,840
'Oh,' said Tom suddenly.

1433
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:15,840
'Angela, my love, I want you to meet a very
good friend of mine.'

1434
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:16,840
He turned and smiled at Kemal.

1435
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,840
'Angela, this is Kemal.'

1436
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:18,840
'Hello, Kemal, nice to meet you,' said Angela.

1437
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,840
'Hello,' he said.

1438
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:20,840
'I've never met you before, but I feel I know
you very well!'

1439
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,840
They laughed.

1440
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,840
'Kemal has been wonderful,' said Tom.

1441
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,840
'Without his help, we wouldn't be here now.'

1442
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:24,840
'Oh, I only helped you a little,' said Kemal.

1443
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,840
'A little!' said Tom.

1444
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,840
They watched as Diinya and his men were taken
to a police car.

1445
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,840
'How did the police know what was happening?'
asked Tom.

1446
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,840
At that moment a car drove up to the villa.

1447
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,840
A man got out of the car and walked towards
them.

1448
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,840
He smiled.

1449
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,840
'Hello, Mr Smith,' he said.

1450
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:32,840
'We meet again.'

1451
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,840
'Mr Pennington!'

1452
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,840
smiled Tom.

1453
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,840
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Time for a Holiday

1454
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,840
Later that night, Tom, Kemal and Angela were
relaxing.

1455
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,840
They were sitting in Mr Pennington's flat
in the Consulate building.

1456
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,840
David Pennington was telling them what had
happened.

1457
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,840
'Julie came to see me here at the Consulate,'
he explained.

1458
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,840
'She told me about her conversation with Tom.

1459
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,840
Then I was convinced that Tom's story was
true.

1460
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,840
I contacted the Turkish police again.

1461
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:43,840
After that I tried to contact you, Tom, but
you had left your hotel.

1462
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:44,840
We thought you'd gone back to England.'

1463
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,840
'No,' smiled Tom.

1464
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,840
He looked at Angela.

1465
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:47,840
'I had some urgent business here in Istanbul.'

1466
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,840
They all laughed.

1467
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,840
'How did they treat you in the villa?' asked
Tom.

1468
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,840
'They treated me very well,' replied Angela.

1469
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,840
'When my virus was very bad, they took me
to the doctor.

1470
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:52,840
But I was terribly worried on the Monday you
were arriving in Istanbul.

1471
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:53,840
Diinya knew you were coming because I had
told him earlier.

1472
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,840
And I knew he was going to send someone to
follow you.

1473
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:55,840
I was terribly worried.'

1474
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,840
'They made a big mistake when they took you
to the doctor,' said Tom.

1475
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,840
'If I had not seen you from the bus...'

1476
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,840
'Don't,' said Angela, 'don't even think about
it.'

1477
01:37:58,840 --> 01:37:59,840
'What about the car accident?' said Kemal.

1478
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,840
'How did they arrange that?

1479
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,840
I wonder whose body was in the burnt out car?'

1480
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,840
There was silence while they thought about
that.

1481
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:03,840
'The police will have to find that out,' said
Pennington finally.

1482
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,840
'It was a very clever plan of Diinya's,' said
Tom.

1483
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,840
'Very clever.'

1484
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,840
'Yes,' agreed Pennington.

1485
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,840
'And drug-smugglers like Diinya can make millions
of pounds.'

1486
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,840
'Well - it's over now,' said Angela.

1487
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,840
She turned to Tom.

1488
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,840
'Do you remember the letter I wrote to you
Tom?

1489
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:11,840
I said that life here in Istanbul is very
interesting.

1490
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,840
I was right, wasn't I?'

1491
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,840
They all laughed.

1492
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,840
'Yes,' said Tom, 'a little bit too interesting
for me!

1493
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,840
After all this, do you know what I want?'

1494
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,840
'What?'

1495
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:16,849
'I want a really dull, uninteresting holiday
in Istanbul!'
