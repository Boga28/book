00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:23,970
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,580
Only me, Jojo

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,920
It's dark again.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,329
So it's evening.

5
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,670
It's the third evening.

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,809
No, I'm wrong.

7
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,539
It's the fourth evening.

8
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,579
It's...

9
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,620
Tuesday...

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,660
Wednesday...

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,700
Thursday.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,829
Yes, it's Thursday.

13
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,750
Why do I count the days?

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,950
Why do I say it's Thursday?

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
There aren't any more

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,109
days.

17
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,539
There's just time.

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,259
Time when it's dark, and time when it's light.

19
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:12,390
Everything is dead, so why not days, too?

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,659
Yes.

21
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,840
No more days.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,820
No more Thursdays.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,360
There's only now.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,890
And there's only me.

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,890
Why?

26
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,909
Why aren't I dead, too?

27
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,570
That's a stupid question, Jojo, I say to myself.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,979
You know why you aren't dead.

29
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,580
You aren't dead because you weren't in the
house.

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,580
You were

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,009
in the fields when the men came.

32
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,110
But that's not my question.

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,899
I want to know why I was in the fields.

34
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,810
Why wasn't I in the house with my

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,180
family?

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,729
There are no answers to questions like that,
Jojo, I tell myself.

37
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,090
I have to talk to myself because there isn't
anyone else.

38
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,090
I think there

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,160
are mice here.

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,099
I can hear them at night.

41
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,230
You can't talk to mice.

42
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,890
But there aren't any other people.

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,700
There's only me.

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Jojo.

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,239
I know this because I listen.

46
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,620
I listen all day and all night.

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,560
I hide in our stable, where the horse lived.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,099
And I hear nothing.

49
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,129
Just the

50
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,129
mice.

51
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,750
The village is quiet.

52
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,500
There is smoke now, but smoke is quiet.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,280
The fires were noisy, but the fires have stopped.

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
It rained yesterday,

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,200
and after the rain there were no more fires.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,450
Just smoke.

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,000
Of course, I'm not the only thing alive here.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,030
As well as the mice, there's a dog somewhere
in the village.

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,330
I can hear it.

60
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,330
And there are

61
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,030
rats and flies.

62
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,060
But I think I'm the only person here.

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,810
All the others are dead.

64
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,470
Everyone in the village is dead.

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:27,629
There's only me now and I don't know what
to do.

66
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,409
I'm not in our house.

67
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,830
I went into our house after the men went away.

68
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,970
So I saw my family.

69
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,260
All of them on the floor.

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,260
All the blood on the

71
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,700
floor, too.

72
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,739
They were all dead.

73
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,610
My mother, my father, my sister, my brother.

74
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,959
My family.

75
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,069
Jojo, don't think about that, I say to myself.

76
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,060
Don't think about the blood.

77
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,770
Don't think about those things.

78
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,390
But I can't stop thinking

79
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,340
about them.

80
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,510
My mother had no clothes on.

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,310
I've never seen my mother without clothes.

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,970
Perhaps I will go into the house tomorrow
and put some

83
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,820
clothes on my mother.

84
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,549
She must be cold without clothes.

85
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,760
But I'm afraid that the men are going to come
back.

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,919
Perhaps they are looking for me.

87
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,010
Perhaps they will come back for me.

88
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,560
Perhaps I want them to find me.

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,970
Then I can be dead, too.

90
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,970
I don't want

91
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,040
to be the only one alive.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,810
Come on, Jojo, I say to myself.

93
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,800
You are the man of the family now.

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,870
You must be a big boy.

95
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,530
You must be strong.

96
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,490
It's difficult to be strong when you're ten.

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,940
And I'm only just ten.

98
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,840
My birthday was last month.

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,150
In July.

100
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,060
I got a bicycle for my birthday.

101
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,690
It was white.

102
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,160
It was a wonderful bicycle.

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,900
I cycled to school on it every day.

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,030
There isn't a school here any more.

105
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,940
There was a big fire there and now there's
just smoke.

106
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,280
I don't know where my bicycle is.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,550
But I don't

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,630
want it any more.

109
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,780
I don't understand why the men came to our
village.

110
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,080
It's not a very rich village.

111
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,710
We don't have very much.

112
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,560
We're not like the people in

113
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,500
the big towns.

114
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,310
My brother went to live in the town.

115
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,320
He told us about the cars and the shops and
all the things there.

116
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,919
Why didn't my brother stay in the town?

117
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,680
Why did he come back here?

118
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
Why did he die?

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,460
He was always laughing.

120
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,300
He was always so nice to

121
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
everyone.

122
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,580
He wanted to be a teacher.

123
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,380
He went to the town to study.

124
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,979
My father said that my brother was a good
son.

125
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,040
He worked hard.

126
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
He

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,039
wasn't going to be a poor farmer like my father.

128
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,530
I said I was going to study hard, too, and
my father laughed.

129
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,780
His big laugh.

130
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
The laugh

131
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,530
that made his tummy go up and down.

132
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,180
'I like that,' he said.

133
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,460
'That's good.

134
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,470
I'll have two sons to look after me when I'm
old.'

135
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,530
'I'm going to study too,' said my sister.

136
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,330
'Just find a rich husband,' said my father.

137
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,530
'I don't want a rich husband,' my sister told
me.

138
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,580
'I'm going to be a teacher like our brother.

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,430
You see, Jojo, our father doesn't know, but

140
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,210
there are lots of women teachers in the town.

141
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,870
Our brother told me.'

142
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,160
But my sister can't be a teacher now.

143
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,330
She's dead on the floor.

144
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,440
There was blood on her legs.

145
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,210
I pulled down her skirt.

146
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,210
It wasn't nice like

147
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,910
that.

148
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,190
My sister was always very nice.

149
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,780
She was kind, too.

150
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,870
Why did the men hurt her?

151
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,820
She never hurt anyone.

152
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,000
Sometimes I want to die now, too.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,270
But sometimes I don't.

154
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,620
I don't want to die.

155
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,031
I sit at the back of the stable.

156
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:46,580
The stable is where our horse slept at night.

157
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,120
But the men took away all the horses.

158
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,090
I heard them.

159
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,090
I'm

160
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,680
happy that our horse is alive.

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
She was a good horse.

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,460
I gave her nuts.

163
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,060
She liked eating nuts.

164
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm very hungry, but I don't want to look
for food.

165
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,510
I'm afraid one of the men will come back and
see me.

166
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,910
I'll stay here and be very quiet.

167
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,120
Then no one will find me.

168
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,400
It's dark now.

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,169
I can hear the mice.

170
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,370
Or perhaps they're rats.

171
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,490
I'm not afraid of them.

172
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,490
They are probably hungry.

173
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,180
I'm so hungry I can't

174
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,180
sleep.

175
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,560
Don't think about food.

176
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,310
Think about something else.

177
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,450
Then I'll forget how hungry I am.

178
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,030
Perhaps I'll talk to my mother.

179
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,320
Or my brother or my

180
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,590
sister.

181
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,260
I like to think about them.

182
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,930
Perhaps that's why I'm alive.

183
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,130
So one day I can tell people about them.

184
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,360
I'm Jojo, I'll say.

185
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm alone

186
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,960
now, but once I had a family.

187
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,120
My grandmother said that when people die,
they go away very slowly.

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,149
After they die, they stay in the air so you
can say goodbye to them.

189
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,430
'You mustn't be afraid of ghosts,' she told
me.

190
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,580
'Ghosts are good.

191
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,750
You can talk to them and they will help you.'

192
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,520
I think that there are lots of ghosts here.

193
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,529
I think that my grandmother was right.

194
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm going to tell them that I'm here.

195
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,370
This is Jojo, I'll say.

196
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,690
I'm not dead and I won't let the men find
me.

197
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,720
I'll stay here and I'll talk

198
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,620
to you so you won't feel so sad.

199
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,589
Maybe the ghosts will help me.

200
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,290
There's a sound outside the stable.

201
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,290
There's something there.

202
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,290
Something bigger than a mouse.

203
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,050
I don't know what it is.

204
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,020
And now I can hear

205
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,470
another sound.

206
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,810
A bigger sound, like a lorry.

207
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,700
It is a lorry.

208
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,660
A lorry is coming here to the village.

209
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,580
The men are coming here.

210
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,589
I'll be very quiet.

211
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:39,029
Perhaps they won't find me.

212
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,029
CHAPTER TWO

213
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,720
The men in the lorry

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:50,590
The sound outside the stable door changes
and I know what it is.

215
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,590
Cluck...

216
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,590
cluck...

217
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,590
cluck...

218
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,590
cluck.

219
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,190
It's my chicken, Whitetail.

220
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,190
Whitetail

221
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,889
is my favourite chicken.

222
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:01,370
She gives us lots of eggs.

223
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,130
'We're never going to eat her,' my father
once told me.

224
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,589
He understood that Whitetail

225
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,389
was my chicken.

226
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:14,660
I call to Whitetail and she answers me.

227
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,350
She comes into the stable, but she's very
afraid.

228
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,060
Maybe the men tried to kill her.

229
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
I take her in

230
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,210
my arms and talk to her.

231
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,940
'I'm very hungry,' I tell Whitetail, 'but
I can't go and look for your eggs because

232
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,740
the men are coming.

233
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,010
I have to be careful.

234
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,010
I don't want

235
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,520
anyone to find me.'

236
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,269
As I talk to her, I hear another sound, the
sound of the lorry.

237
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,389
It's getting nearer.

238
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm afraid that the men will find Whitetail.

239
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,250
Perhaps they will find me, too.

240
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,110
And then they will kill both of us.

241
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,560
'You're afraid and I'm

242
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,089
afraid, too,' I tell her.

243
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:10,800
She doesn't move in my arms, but I feel a
bit better now she's with me.

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,389
She's happier now, too.

245
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:14,389
She's quiet in

246
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,769
my arms.

247
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:21,029
The sound of the lorry gets very loud.

248
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,150
The men are here, outside our farm.

249
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,320
I listen and wait.

250
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,880
I can hear lots of voices, but they sound
different.

251
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,860
They don't sound like the men in our village
and they don't sound like the men who

252
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,640
live across the river.

253
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,459
I look out through a hole in the wall and
I see the men.

254
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,949
They aren't the men from across the river.

255
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:54,510
They are soldiers, and they look

256
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
different.

257
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:03,639
Their clothes and their boots look new, and
some of them have red hair.

258
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,320
One of them goes into our house.

259
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,410
I see him coming out

260
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,410
again.

261
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,020
He is being sick on the ground.

262
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,430
Another older soldier speaks to him.

263
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,510
He puts his arm around him.

264
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,529
I don't understand what he says,

265
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,720
but I think he is nice to the young soldier.

266
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,120
I think that maybe these are not bad men.

267
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,670
But I don't know who they are.

268
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,960
They have strange voices.

269
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,839
I must be careful.

270
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
They are looking everywhere.

271
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,500
I try to hide in a dark bit of the stable.

272
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,510
There is no door because of the fire.

273
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,130
A soldier comes in.

274
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,310
He is not old.

275
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,610
A little bit older than my brother, I think.

276
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,829
He is the young soldier who was sick.

277
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:00,829
Then Whitetail

278
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,839
begins to cluck again.

279
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,389
The soldier shouts something, but I don't
understand.

280
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:07,880
He has a gun.

281
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,220
I can't stop Whitetail moving and clucking.

282
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
I

283
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,339
put her down and she runs to the soldier.

284
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,360
He begins to laugh.

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,500
Whitetail runs out of the stable and the soldier
runs after her.

286
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,649
They're going to kill her, I think.

287
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:27,750
'No!'

288
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,990
I shout.

289
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,470
I run out of the stable.

290
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,509
'Don't kill her!

291
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,550
She's my chicken!'

292
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,949
The soldiers all look at me.

293
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:40,160
I try to move again, but I can't.

294
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,410
I haven't eaten anything for days.

295
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,259
I fall down.

296
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,610
A soldier picks me up.

297
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,949
Now they are going to kill me, I think.

298
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,509
But he doesn't look angry.

299
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,510
He looks very sad.

300
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,250
He shouts something.

301
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,209
Nothing happens.

302
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,709
The men are all looking at my house.

303
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,209
And then I see another man.

304
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,190
He was in my house and now he comes

305
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,910
across to me.

306
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,990
He doesn't look like the soldiers.

307
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,320
He's tall with yellow hair.

308
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,980
He has two big cameras.

309
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,260
My brother had a camera, but it was

310
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,630
very small.

311
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,630
The man smiles at me as he walks.

312
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,069
He opens his hands to show that he has nothing
in them.

313
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:34,209
'Don't be afraid,' he says.

314
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:38,839
He speaks our language, but he speaks it rather
strangely.

315
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,019
'You're safe now,' he says.

316
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,649
'These soldiers won't

317
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:44,920
hurt you.'

318
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,420
'Where's my chicken?'

319
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
I ask.

320
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,569
'I don't want the soldiers to hurt my chicken.'

321
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:54,329
The man says something to the soldiers in
their language.

322
00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:00,079
They laugh and then the young soldier who
came into the stable comes to me.

323
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,029
Whitetail is in his arms and the soldier gives
her to me.

324
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,870
The soldier says something and smiles.

325
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,770
The man with the cameras tells me that the
soldier comes from a village like mine.

326
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,020
His father is a farmer and he has lots of
chickens and

327
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,490
ducks.

328
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,930
But his village is a long way from here.

329
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,430
'What's your name?'

330
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,630
the man asks me.

331
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,910
'Jojo,' I tell him.

332
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,800
And I tell him that I'm the only one here
in the village.

333
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,880
He says my words in the other language.

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
He tells me that

335
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,389
this is translating.

336
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,180
He will tell the soldiers anything that I
want to tell them.

337
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,930
I don't want to tell them anything, but the
man says that they are here to help.

338
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,710
'Are you hurt?' asks the man with the cameras.

339
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,620
He tells me to call him Chris.

340
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,130
I tell Chris that I'm not hurt.

341
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,269
I was in the fields when the

342
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,069
men came.

343
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,780
The soldiers smile at me.

344
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,810
They have brown and green clothes, but their
hats are blue.

345
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,919
It's like a bit of the sky on the top of their

346
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,030
heads.

347
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,910
'Are you hungry?' asks Chris.

348
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,140
'Yes,' I say, 'I'm very hungry.'

349
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,710
The soldiers make a small fire for cooking.

350
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,660
I can hear it.

351
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,010
It's a good sound.

352
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,770
The fire in the village was different.

353
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,770
It made a sound like

354
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,050
the wind at night.

355
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:46,040
A great big wind that makes you hide in your
bed with the blanket over your head.

356
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,470
The soldiers give me some rice and beans.

357
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,450
It's very good.

358
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,740
'Don't eat it too fast or your tummy will
hurt,' says Chris.

359
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
My mother often

360
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,430
said that.

361
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,790
I want to cry, but I can't.

362
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:10,770
The tears are all inside my head like a big
ball of rice that won't go down.

363
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,000
The soldiers have lots of blankets in the
lorry.

364
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,820
Chris takes one and puts it over me.

365
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,830
I sit down and Whitetail sits down next to
me.

366
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,830
The

367
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,470
young soldier has given Whitetail some food,
too.

368
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,070
He tells me that his friends call him Duck
now, because he has chickens and ducks at

369
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,020
home.

370
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,570
He smiles at me.

371
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:43,280
I want to smile, but I don't have any smiles
any more.

372
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,370
The men took them away with them across the
river.

373
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,780
I can't feel the ghosts of my family any more.

374
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,340
Perhaps they are inside the stable.

375
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,240
They don't know that I am outside here with
the

376
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,290
soldiers.

377
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,280
The soldiers say that I am safe now.

378
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,630
I want to believe them.

379
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,690
But what's going to happen when they go away
and I'm all alone again?

380
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,919
I ask Chris and he tells me that the soldiers
are going to take me with them.

381
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,130
'You can't stay here all alone,' says Chris.

382
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,720
I don't know where I'm going, but Chris tells
me it's a long way away from the village.

383
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,471
He says that I'm going to a place where there
are

384
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,330
lots of children like me.

385
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,510
He says that there has been fighting in other
places.

386
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,910
And there are lots of children without families.

387
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,270
But I

388
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,610
have a family.

389
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,990
They're here.

390
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,840
The soldiers don't understand that.

391
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,890
Chris doesn't understand.

392
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:59,190
Only the ghosts understand.

393
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,299
CHAPTER THREE

394
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,570
The field of the families

395
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,810
The soldiers say that they need to bury all
the people in the village.

396
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,540
This is good.

397
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,950
It's not good for dead people to be inside
the

398
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,289
houses.

399
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:22,690
'The earth is kind to the dead,' my grandmother
always said.

400
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,309
'You must give the dead to the earth.'

401
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:28,930
The soldiers understand this.

402
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,909
'The soldiers need to know the names of the
people,' says Chris.

403
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,559
'We need to know who we are burying.

404
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,870
Do you know who they are, Jojo?'

405
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,620
'Of course I know,' I say.

406
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,870
'Everyone in the village knows everyone else.'

407
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,570
Chris tells me that he is a photographer and
a writer.

408
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,100
'Why are you here?'

409
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,990
I ask him.

410
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,330
'Why?'

411
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,179
Chris asks.

412
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:00,800
He looks around my village.

413
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,140
Or what was my village.

414
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,549
'Because of this,' he says.

415
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,110
'Because men and women and children are

416
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,950
dying in your country, and it's important
that people outside your country know these

417
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,720
things.'

418
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,900
He speaks very quietly as if he is talking

419
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,320
to himself.

420
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,299
'I take photos because the dead have no one
else to speak for them.'

421
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,210
I understand this.

422
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,260
In our village my grandmother always told
the stories of the dead.

423
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,610
And after she died, the teacher told her story.

424
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,610
Now,

425
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,070
there is only me here.

426
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,159
So Chris is going to tell their stories.

427
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,240
Chris talks to me.

428
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,210
He tells me that he comes from a country called
England.

429
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,980
It's a long way from here.

430
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,950
He looks tired.

431
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,370
His clothes look

432
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,990
tired, too.

433
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,080
Maybe he sleeps in his clothes.

434
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,150
Chris has a face like tired clothes.

435
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,330
Maybe he's travelled a long way.

436
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,640
After I've eaten, I feel stronger.

437
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,289
I can stand up.

438
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:24,570
Chris takes me over to talk to the soldiers.

439
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,540
'You must bury everyone in the field of the
families,' I tell the soldiers.

440
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,190
'This is where all the families are together.

441
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,190
It's very

442
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,440
important that the dead sleep with their families.'

443
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,790
The soldiers understand.

444
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,570
They have families at home, they say.

445
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:52,630
The soldiers take my family out of the house
and I don't want to look, but I do look.

446
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,190
The soldiers have put blankets over the bodies.

447
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,690
There is no more blood.

448
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,870
The soldiers speak very quietly.

449
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,340
They don't want to wake up my family.

450
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,299
They understand that you have to talk

451
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:12,169
quietly when you are talking to ghosts.

452
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:19,830
I tell Chris the names of all the people in
the village and he writes down their names.

453
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,050
Then we go into the field of the families.

454
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,870
We walk round the village.

455
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,920
I know all the people in the village.

456
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,000
I don't know anything outside the village,
and I'm afraid of the world

457
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,010
outside.

458
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,360
But I don't tell anyone.

459
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,679
I tell the soldiers the names of the people
in each house.

460
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,330
Then they bring out the bodies.

461
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,880
We go first to the big house.

462
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,179
The most important man in the village lived
here.

463
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,910
He had many cows, as well as goats and chickens.

464
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,910
There is

465
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,910
nothing here now.

466
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,380
All his family are dead.

467
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,669
His daughter is dead.

468
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,450
She was at school with me.

469
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,770
I liked her, she was very funny.

470
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,770
She liked

471
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,770
drawing.

472
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,190
She sometimes drew pictures of the teacher
in class.

473
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,140
Now she is a body under a blanket.

474
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,010
Next to her is her brother.

475
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,450
He was a bit older than me.

476
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,610
He went to school, too, and he helped in the

477
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,549
fields.

478
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:36,559
He milked the goats in the mornings and evenings,
and worked with his father on Saturdays and

479
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,799
Sundays.

480
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,070
All my friends.

481
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,200
All my cousins and aunts and uncles.

482
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,549
All the people I talked to every day.

483
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:51,460
The man with a funny walk, who lived by himself

484
00:24:51,460 --> 00:25:00,710
near the river; the woman who gave all the
children sweets; our teacher, my family.

485
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,679
They aren't here any more.

486
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,900
There are only bodies under

487
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,909
blankets.

488
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:12,900
When we go to the teacher's house, we hear
sounds.

489
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,650
It's the teacher's dog, inside the house.

490
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,090
Chris goes into the house and then he comes

491
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,120
out.

492
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,440
'The dog isn't hurt,' Chris tells me, 'but
he's afraid and very hungry.

493
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,640
I can't go near him.

494
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,020
Do you know him, Jojo?

495
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,200
Does he have a name?'

496
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,679
'I know him,' I say.

497
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,169
'But he doesn't have a name.

498
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,419
The teacher just called him Dog.'

499
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:45,720
'The dog's afraid, but he needs some food
and water,' Chris tells me.

500
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,779
'I think that I smell strange to the dog.

501
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,070
Perhaps your smell won't

502
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,000
be so strange, Jojo.

503
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,720
Can you take the dog some food and water?'

504
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,140
I don't know why they don't just kill the
dog.

505
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,610
He doesn't have a job to do here any more.

506
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,210
'Why don't the soldiers shoot the dog?'

507
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,640
I ask Chris.

508
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,010
'They don't want to,' says Chris.

509
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,970
'In my country we love animals.

510
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,700
We don't like to hurt them.'

511
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,720
I think I know why they don't want to kill
the dog.

512
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,560
There are too many bodies here already.

513
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,789
The soldiers have food in little boxes.

514
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:36,320
They open a box and give it to me and I take
it inside the teacher's house.

515
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,520
The teacher's body has gone, but there's blood
on the floor.

516
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,050
The smell of the blood is making the dog very
afraid.

517
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,640
'Hello, Dog,' I say.

518
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,039
'It's me, Jojo.'

519
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,450
Dog is very angry.

520
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,809
He wants to hurt me.

521
00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,190
I put the food on the ground and push it to
him.

522
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,190
Dog eats it

523
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,450
very quickly and drinks the water and I talk
to him.

524
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,710
After a while, he is quieter.

525
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,950
And then I take him outside.

526
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,600
He's very happy to be

527
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,020
outside and he runs around.

528
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,310
He's a nice dog.

529
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,660
He's not at all dangerous.

530
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,660
Chris takes photos of me and Dog.

531
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,440
He takes photos very quickly.

532
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,870
When my brother took photos, he told me not
to move.

533
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,150
But Chris takes

534
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,230
photos when I am moving.

535
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,150
His camera makes a funny click click sound.

536
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,140
The soldiers all like Dog.

537
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,720
They give him chocolate.

538
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,620
And they give me chocolate, too.

539
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,350
The soldiers and I go to my school.

540
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,429
The fire was very big here.

541
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,960
There is no school building here any more.

542
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,110
But there are also no bodies.

543
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,279
The school was closed when the men came.

544
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,820
The soldiers find two books on the floor.

545
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,159
They have a few pages which aren't burnt.

546
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,059
They give the books to me.

547
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,130
The fire has eaten the

548
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,130
village.

549
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,850
There is nothing here now.

550
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:25,539
Only me and Dog and Whitetail and two books
with black pages.

551
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:31,360
I show Chris the books and he looks very sad.

552
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,760
'My children read books like that,' he tells
me.

553
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,260
The soldiers go into the field of the families.

554
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,570
They make holes and bury the people from my
village.

555
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,960
Then they write their names on bits

556
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,269
of wood and push the bits of wood into the
earth, too.

557
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:55,070
I go into the field with them.

558
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,380
I want to talk to my grandmother.

559
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,740
'Hello, grandmother,' I say.

560
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,590
'This is Jojo.

561
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,210
I've brought you the family.

562
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,649
I know you'll be happy to see them again.

563
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:10,649
I'm not coming with

564
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:11,700
them.

565
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,090
But I want to be with them, grandmother.

566
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,980
I'm all alone here.

567
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,020
Well, not really alone.

568
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,279
There are lots of soldiers.

569
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,620
They don't speak

570
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,980
our language, so they can't talk to you.

571
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,630
They're nice to me, but they say they're going
to take me away.

572
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,110
I don't want to leave you,

573
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,490
grandmother, but I know I have to go.

574
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,870
So I'm here to say goodbye.'

575
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:46,300
Above the field I can see big birds in the
sky.

576
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
They are bad birds.

577
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Birds that don't sing.

578
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,080
The birds that sing have all gone.

579
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,140
I am talking quietly to my grandmother when
I hear sounds.

580
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,120
They are a long way away, but I know what
they are.

581
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,100
Guns.

582
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,710
Some of the men who came across the river
had guns.

583
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,450
I could hear the sound of the guns in the
field.

584
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,590
They were very loud.

585
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,590
When they

586
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,779
stopped, I could hear them in my head.

587
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,179
These guns make a bigger sound.

588
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:29,750
They're a long way away, but I can hear them.

589
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,580
The soldiers are listening, too.

590
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,720
They say that we must leave now.

591
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:42,640
The fighting is getting nearer.

592
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
CHAPTER FOUR

593
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,140
The walls will fall down

594
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,220
I didn't know about the fighting.

595
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,780
All I knew was the village and the things
my brother told me about the big town.

596
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,890
No one told me about

597
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,890
fighting.

598
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,350
There are so many things that I don't know.

599
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,140
Right now, I don't know where I'm going.

600
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,500
I only know that I'm leaving my village.

601
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,000
Chris has a jeep and he says that he will
drive me to the Children's House.

602
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,159
I know it's a jeep because my uncle had a
jeep once.

603
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,159
Chris's

604
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,419
jeep is very dirty.

605
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:33,830
That's because the earth roads are wet now.

606
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:40,250
I get into the jeep with Chris and we follow
the soldiers out of our village.

607
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,789
I am leaving my home.

608
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:46,809
I am leaving everything I know.

609
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:52,919
I'm thirsty and Chris gives me water from
a strange flat bottle.

610
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,870
It's got a kind of coat on it.

611
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,860
Chris says that it's a soldier's water

612
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,179
bottle and it's like that to keep the water
cold.

613
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,570
It's good water.

614
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,429
There are no flies in it and it's not green
like the water from the river.

615
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,370
'Why do people fight?'

616
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,830
I ask Chris.

617
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,470
'I don't know,' says Chris.

618
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,640
He sounds very tired.

619
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,280
'I don't know why men fight each other.

620
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,720
All I do is take photos and tell stories.'

621
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,120
I love stories.

622
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,419
My grandmother often told me stories about
our family and what happened a long, long

623
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:39,380
time ago.

624
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,200
I tell Chris this.

625
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,620
'I don't write stories like that,' says Chris.

626
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,179
'I write stories about things that are happening
now.

627
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:53,409
I write for a newspaper in England.

628
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:54,409
I

629
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:59,110
tell people a long way away about people like
you,' he says.

630
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,450
'About me?'

631
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,450
I ask.

632
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,590
'Are you going to tell my story?'

633
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,289
'Maybe,' says Chris.

634
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,510
'Is that OK?'

635
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,399
I think about it.

636
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,890
'Yes,' I decide.

637
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:17,010
'That's OK.'

638
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:22,419
'My newspaper likes stories about children,'
Chris says.

639
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:27,440
He sounds angry, but I don't know why.

640
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,610
'Tell me about your family,' says Chris.

641
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,080
So I tell Chris about my family.

642
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,190
I can do that.

643
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,780
But I can't talk about the men.

644
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,360
There are no words for that.

645
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,960
The words don't want to come

646
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,500
out.

647
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,519
I will never tell anyone about those things.

648
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,889
I tell Chris about my parents and about my
brother and sister.

649
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:58,730
I want people to know about my family.

650
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,450
Chris says he will tell people all

651
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,250
about them.

652
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,480
He'll tell them about how my father worried
about the rain.

653
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,520
He'll tell them how my sister wanted to be
a teacher like my

654
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,119
brother, and he'll tell them about me and
my white bicycle.

655
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,540
I tell him how my mother looked after the
house.

656
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,700
'After the fire, a lot of the house fell down.

657
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,129
I told my mother all about it,' I say to

658
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:29,260
Chris.

659
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,929
'You told your mother?' he asks.

660
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:33,929
'Yes.

661
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,230
I talked to her ghost.

662
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,400
You know that, after they die, people go away
very slowly.

663
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,649
I don't know a lot about ghosts,' I tell Chris.

664
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:49,230
'Only what my grandmother told me.

665
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:56,800
She said that you can't see them and you can't
hear them, but you know that they're there.'

666
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,920
'I think that your grandmother was right,'
says Chris.

667
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,750
'When you go to a village after people die
you can feel them there.'

668
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,880
I'm happy that Chris understands.

669
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,030
I like Chris.

670
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,670
He is my new friend.

671
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,640
I think he understands.

672
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,130
He says that he often comes to my country.

673
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,130
He

674
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,119
likes it very much.

675
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,150
I tell Chris that I'm worried about my house.

676
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,980
'I'm not there now,' I tell him.

677
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,480
'Perhaps all the walls will fall down.

678
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,490
Then there will be no more house.'

679
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,950
'I'm sorry,' says Chris.

680
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,710
'But you can't stay there.

681
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,690
It's too close to the fighting.'

682
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:47,541
'When I was a very small boy,' I tell Chris,
'I didn't know why there were walls, so I

683
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,150
asked my mother.'

684
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,170
'What did she say?'

685
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,450
Chris asks me.

686
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,800
'She told me that the walls hold up the roof,
and you need the roof so you don't get wet

687
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,680
when it rains.

688
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,210
So I went outside to look at the

689
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,240
roof, but it was raining and I got very wet.'

690
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,369
Chris laughs.

691
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:11,800
'I was very small,' I tell him.

692
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,780
'I asked my mother lots of questions and she
always knew the answers.'

693
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,350
'My children were the same.

694
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:26,700
They always asked me lots of questions, but
I don't think I always knew the answers,'

695
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,969
says Chris.

696
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:35,290
'But we also had walls outside, all the way
round the farm,' I tell Chris.

697
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,760
'You saw them.

698
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,810
When I was small, I walked round them and

699
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,970
thought that these were walls but there wasn't
a roof.

700
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:49,700
So I asked my mother why there were walls
all round the farm and no roof.'

701
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,290
'And what did your mother say?'

702
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,540
Chris asks me.

703
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,510
'She told me that the walls showed that it
was our house.

704
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,060
We had walls to stop other people from coming
in.

705
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,751
But I thought, why did we want

706
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,819
to stop people from coming in?

707
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:09,920
I didn't understand then, you see.

708
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,240
Lots of people came into our house.

709
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,490
My father's friends often came in

710
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,849
and they drank and laughed together.

711
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,700
I heard them when I woke up in the night.

712
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,700
And in the morning my father had a headache
and we all

713
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,880
walked very quietly.'

714
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,630
Chris laughs.

715
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,300
I like his laugh.

716
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,510
'I know just how your father felt,' he says.

717
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,120
'When I drink too much, I get headaches, too.'

718
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,579
'My brother had friends in the house, too,'
I tell Chris.

719
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,910
'Sometimes people came to buy animals and
to sell them.

720
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,910
And the doctor from the

721
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,360
next village came into our house once when
I hurt my head.

722
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,760
So I thought and thought.

723
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,440
And then I asked my mother about it again.'

724
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,260
'And what did your mother say?'

725
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,330
Chris asks again.

726
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,090
'She told me that there were other people
in the world.

727
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,430
People who weren't nice.

728
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,670
She told me that there were people on the
other side of

729
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,310
the river.

730
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,390
They didn't like us and they didn't want us
to live on our farms.

731
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,750
So we had walls.

732
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,200
And my mother told me that the river was our

733
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,050
wall, too.

734
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,090
It was so big, no one could cross it.

735
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,310
So we were safe.

736
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,750
I didn't understand then.

737
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,000
I thought, how can a river be like a wall?

738
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But

739
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,590
I understand now.

740
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,790
And my mother was wrong.

741
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,609
I thought that she knew all the answers, but
she didn't.

742
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:47,589
She didn't know that the people could

743
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,940
cross the river.

744
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,760
She thought that we were safe.

745
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,660
And when the people came from the other side
of the river, the walls didn't stop them.

746
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
The

747
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,650
river didn't stop them.'

748
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,069
Chris is quiet.

749
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:07,740
We're going slowly along the road.

750
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,140
The road is very bad because of the rain.

751
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,119
The guns are louder now.

752
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,390
We're driving past a village and I can see
that there has been a fire here, too.

753
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,859
It's all black and it smells like our village.

754
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:25,190
It's a

755
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,780
very bad smell.

756
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:33,130
We drive slowly, but we see nobody.

757
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:40,180
It's another village of ghosts.

758
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,310
CHAPTER FIVE

759
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,089
The river

760
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:49,250
This is what a dead village smells like, I
think.

761
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,859
We drive through slowly.

762
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,630
There are black birds in the sky here, too.

763
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,630
They know that

764
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,680
there are bodies here.

765
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,650
They want to eat the bodies.

766
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,890
Once, one of our cows died in the night.

767
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,670
In the morning these birds came and started

768
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,270
to eat the cow.

769
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:12,180
They can smell it.

770
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,650
The village smells worse than a dead cow.

771
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,560
Perhaps all my country smells like this now.

772
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,560
The men who do these things must be very bad.

773
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,540
I can see the river through the trees.

774
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,440
We are driving along by the river.

775
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,670
I like the river.

776
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,849
It's a very big river and it goes very fast.

777
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:38,849
I

778
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,950
often walked along it with my brother.

779
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,920
He said that you can't swim in it.

780
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,589
And if you fall in the river, in two hours
you'll be in another

781
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:49,490
country.

782
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,700
He told me not to forget that.

783
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,680
I could see how fast it was.

784
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,680
I put a piece of wood in the river once and
whoosh it was gone.

785
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,109
I ran along the side of the river, but the

786
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:06,810
piece of wood was faster than me.

787
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,470
It was always quiet near the river.

788
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,859
There were trees which looked as if they were
talking to the water.

789
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:15,670
The river was a lot of different

790
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,190
colours.

791
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:24,290
When it rained, the river was green and grey
and silver like the fish that swam in it.

792
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,920
On sunny days the river had lots of little

793
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,349
gold bits in it.

794
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:35,910
They danced on top of the water as if they
were happy that it was a sunny day.

795
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,390
Last month my father and I walked along the
river.

796
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,390
There was a farmer he wanted to see in another
village, and he said that because it was

797
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,870
the school holidays, I could go with him.

798
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,760
I was very happy.

799
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,270
I liked going for walks with my father.

800
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,490
My father often talked to me on these walks.

801
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,130
He told me what he was thinking.

802
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,200
'It's too dry,' he said.

803
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,190
Or, 'It's too wet.'

804
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,190
It was nearly

805
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,530
always too dry or too wet.

806
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,430
There was always too much rain or not enough
rain.

807
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,060
When there was too much rain, there were lots
of weeds in

808
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,609
the fields.

809
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:20,359
My father told me that weeds were green plants
that were in the wrong place.

810
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,920
They made my father angry.

811
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,910
He hated the weeds.

812
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,290
And I hated the weeds because it was my job
to go into the fields after school and pull

813
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,170
them out of the ground.

814
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,820
When there was not enough rain, the fields
went yellow and then brown and the ground

815
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,220
was hard like the walls of our house.

816
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Then all the

817
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,150
plants died.

818
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,370
My father and I walked along the river to
a place where there were lots of stones.

819
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,099
'There was a farm here once,' said my father.

820
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:55,430
'What happened?'

821
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,420
I asked him.

822
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,500
'The people from across the river came,' my
father told me.

823
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,260
'They took all the animals and then made a
big fire.

824
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,070
And now there's nothing.

825
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,210
Just stones and weeds.'

826
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,069
'What about the people?'

827
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:14,380
I asked my father.

828
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,020
He didn't tell me.

829
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,560
I know now why he didn't tell me.

830
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,970
It was because the people on that other farm
were dead.

831
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,220
My father didn't want me to know things like

832
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,630
that.

833
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,350
I can understand that now.

834
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,640
Because I know what happens when the men come.

835
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,310
'There's the river,' I say to Chris as we
see it again through the trees.

836
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,770
It looks different here.

837
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:45,540
It's the same river as the river near

838
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,640
my village, but it's not the same.

839
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,800
I think of my mother's face after the men
came.

840
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,880
It was the same but not the same.

841
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I don't want to think

842
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
about that.

843
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,450
'Do you know any stories?'

844
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,150
I ask Chris.

845
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,770
'Oh yes, lots of stories,' he says.

846
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,400
'What's your favourite story?'

847
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,369
I ask him.

848
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:17,609
'It's about some animals who live near a river,'
he tells me.

849
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:19,690
'I'll tell you the story.

850
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,360
It begins with a little black mole.

851
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,530
The mole lives

852
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,760
under the ground.'

853
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,130
'That's good,' I say.

854
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,250
'You're safe under the ground.'

855
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,760
Chris tells me the story.

856
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,690
It's about a toad who lives in a big house.

857
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:40,140
One day when he's out, bad animals come into
his house and take it

858
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,720
away from him.

859
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,710
'Do the soldiers with blue hats come and help
the toad?'

860
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,109
I ask Chris.

861
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:50,570
'No, I don't think so,' says Chris.

862
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:55,920
'I think that the rat and the mole tell the
bad animals to go away.'

863
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,720
'Do they go away?'

864
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,980
I ask him.

865
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,320
'Yes,' he says.

866
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:09,660
'If the soldiers with blue hats ask the bad
men to go away, will they go away?'

867
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,660
I ask.

868
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,420
'I don't know, Jojo,' says Chris.

869
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,540
'I'll tell you another story,' he says.

870
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,750
He tells me about his house in England.

871
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:26,490
He lives in a town called Oxford, where there's
a big university and everyone rides bicycles.

872
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,930
'Can I come and live with you in Oxford?'

873
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,240
I ask him.

874
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,119
'No,' says Chris.

875
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,050
'I'm sorry, Jojo, but I'm not at home very
often.

876
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,309
I'm always travelling.

877
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,349
I never stay anywhere for very long.

878
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:42,400
Today I'm

879
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,300
here, but tomorrow I don't know where I'll
be.

880
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,860
I'll just be somewhere looking for new stories.'

881
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,490
'But you said that your newspaper wanted my
story,' I say.

882
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,050
'They do,' says Chris.

883
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,510
'They'll love your story.

884
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,920
But they want new and different stories every
day.'

885
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,700
'I thought you were my friend,' I say.

886
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,600
I don't want Chris to go.

887
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,010
'I am,' he says.

888
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,619
'And I'll write to you and I'll come and see
you again.

889
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:17,880
And I'll tell you more stories.'

890
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,810
But I don't want to listen to his stories
any more.

891
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:28,270
I can see lights a long way away and I can
hear the guns.

892
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,790
I'm afraid again.

893
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,270
'Don't be afraid,' says Chris.

894
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,820
'The fighting is a long way from here now.

895
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,680
You're safe with us.

896
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,280
The soldiers are just behind us.'

897
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
I look

898
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,630
around and see the lorry with the soldiers
behind us.

899
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,570
It's night now and I'm very tired.

900
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,140
The road is very dark.

901
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,370
It goes ahead of us like a river through the
trees.

902
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:02,380
Like a dark river.

903
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,480
CHAPTER SIX

904
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,200
The Children's House

905
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,240
It's morning when we get to the Children's
House.

906
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,620
I'm asleep and Chris wakes me.

907
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:20,770
I get out of the jeep with Dog and Whitetail,
and lots of children run up to see who I am.

908
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,579
When they see Whitetail, they laugh.

909
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,660
'Is that your supper?' one of the boys asks
me.

910
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,770
I have Whitetail very close to me and move
back to the jeep.

911
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:36,910
'Don't worry,' says a woman who comes out
of the house.

912
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,880
'No one's going to eat your chicken.

913
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,910
I'm Doctor Nicky,' she says.

914
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,220
There are so many children here.

915
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,020
They come from many villages and all of them
have stories like mine.

916
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,150
That's why they're here.

917
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,150
They don't

918
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,630
have homes.

919
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:59,750
'This is your new home,' Chris tells me.

920
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,430
'You'll be fine here.'

921
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,100
He says that he knows Doctor Nicky.

922
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,030
He met her before in another country.

923
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,849
He says that she is very kind and she will
look after me.

924
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:13,849
'Aren't you staying?'

925
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,849
I ask him.

926
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:18,510
'No, Jojo,' he says.

927
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,200
'I'm going to take photos of the fighting.

928
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,589
It's my job.

929
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:25,200
But I'll come back as soon as I can.

930
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,920
Goodbye, Jojo,' he says.

931
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,490
And then he drives away very quickly.

932
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,230
Doctor Nicky shows me round the Children's
House.

933
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,630
But it isn't just one house.

934
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,490
There are many houses where people sleep and
eat.

935
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,490
And

936
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,760
there's a big hospital for all the children
who are hurt.

937
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,180
There are lots of children here who are hurt.

938
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,130
The house where I sleep is bigger

939
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,099
than any house in my village.

940
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,330
We all sleep in one big long room.

941
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,369
Days go by and other children come here.

942
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,450
We all do lessons together and we play football.

943
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,579
Dog likes football, too, but he always tries
to

944
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:12,760
eat the ball.

945
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,470
It makes the small children laugh.

946
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:21,430
The very small children are happy here because
they don't understand what is happening in

947
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,400
our country.

948
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,510
All the other children are unhappy.

949
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,660
I know that because they shout and cry in
the night.

950
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,540
No-one sleeps quietly here.

951
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,829
Doctor Nicky is the doctor here.

952
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:42,930
She speaks our language very well and is very
nice.

953
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,820
She wears a white T-shirt with letters on
it.

954
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,820
'What

955
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,190
are the letters for?'

956
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,380
I ask her.

957
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:55,180
'The letters are for "Medecins Sans Frontieres".

958
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,890
That means "Doctors without borders",' she
answers.

959
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,800
I don't understand.

960
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,079
My brother had a T-shirt with letters on it.

961
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,059
The letters were the name of our country.

962
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,599
'Is that where you come from?'

963
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,119
I ask.

964
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,960
I know that some countries are very big.

965
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,390
I think that maybe her country is so big that
it doesn't

966
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,800
have any borders.

967
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,550
Maybe it just has sea all around it.

968
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,480
'A land without borders is a good place,'
I tell her.

969
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,450
'You can be safe and you won't be afraid of
the people who live on the other side of

970
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,150
the river.

971
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:39,680
I want to go to the country without borders,'
I tell her.

972
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,130
Doctor Nicky smiles.

973
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,770
'No, Jojo,' she tells me.

974
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:49,060
'It just means that I'm a doctor who will
go anywhere.

975
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:53,150
I will help people in any country.'

976
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,930
'Not the country on the other side of the
river,' I say.

977
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,849
'You can't help them.

978
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:00,040
They are very bad.'

979
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,130
'But there are children there, too,' says
Doctor Nicky.

980
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,280
'They aren't bad.

981
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,859
I will go anywhere where there are children
who need me.'

982
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:10,920
But I

983
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,570
don't want to listen.

984
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,220
I like Doctor Nicky.

985
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:21,660
She has lots of children to look after, but
she often talks to me.

986
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,970
Many of the children are very ill.

987
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:25,970
Some of the

988
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,880
children are here because the men thought
that they were dead.

989
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,490
But they weren't dead.

990
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:36,490
There is one boy here who says nothing.

991
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,150
No one knows his name or where he comes from.

992
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:44,990
We call him 'Red' because he has a red T-shirt.

993
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,330
Doctor Nicky asks me to talk to Red.

994
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:52,589
I say, 'OK,' but I don't really want to talk
to him.

995
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:57,780
Well, I do want to talk to Red because Doctor
Nicky wants me to.

996
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,470
But I don't want Red to tell me what he saw.

997
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,329
I'm afraid.

998
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,329
I don't want to

999
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,850
hear the things that are in his head.

1000
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,069
I think he's seen some very bad things.

1001
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:14,140
I think perhaps he was in his house when the
men came.

1002
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,760
'There are some things that make you want
to stop talking,' I tell Doctor Nicky.

1003
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,839
'I know, Jojo,' she says.

1004
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,010
'But Red doesn't have to tell us what he saw.

1005
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,510
I just need to know his name and where he
comes from.

1006
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,510
I need to

1007
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,839
know if he has a family somewhere.'

1008
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:36,049
'I'll talk to him,' I say.

1009
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:43,370
'So many quiet children and Jojo who never
stops talking,' says Doctor Nicky.

1010
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:48,700
But she smiles at me and I know she likes
me.

1011
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,480
I go outside and Dog follows me.

1012
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,500
Red isn't afraid of Dog, but he's afraid of
people.

1013
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,910
I sit outside and talk to Red.

1014
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,700
I talk about my family, tell him stories.

1015
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,480
I tell him a story about when my mother had
a new dress and how

1016
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,809
it got wet in the rain.

1017
00:53:09,809 --> 00:53:16,230
She put it near the fire to dry and a bit
of wood fell out of the fire and burned it.

1018
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:21,089
Then I tell Red a story about the time my
brother went into the fields with the goats,

1019
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,510
but he started to read a book and the goats
ran

1020
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,510
away.

1021
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,290
'I had a goat,' Red says.

1022
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,299
'Did your goat have a name?'

1023
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:32,410
I ask him.

1024
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,040
Red closes his eyes.

1025
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,730
'Our goats all had names,' I tell him.

1026
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,280
But then I stop.

1027
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,740
I don't want to think about our goats.

1028
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,390
The men took them away.

1029
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,400
'My goat was...'

1030
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,220
Red begins.

1031
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,730
But he never says what his goat was.

1032
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:54,299
He never says any other words.

1033
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:57,750
Only those words about the goat.

1034
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,339
I run to Doctor Nicky.

1035
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:03,369
'Red told me he had a goat,' I tell her.

1036
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:04,640
'Well done, Jojo,' says Doctor Nicky.

1037
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
'That's a start.'

1038
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,740
But it wasn't.

1039
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,670
It was the end.

1040
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:15,859
The next day Red walked out of the Children's
House.

1041
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:19,569
He walked down the road, between the trees.

1042
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:20,569
Maybe he

1043
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:22,030
wanted to go home.

1044
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,339
Maybe he just wanted to go away.

1045
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:26,300
I don't know.

1046
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,660
But I never saw him again.

1047
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,880
After he left, Doctor Nicky looked very sad.

1048
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,030
But then she went back inside the hospital.

1049
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:40,690
There are so many sick children.

1050
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,880
Some of the children here say that Red stepped
on a landmine after he left the Children's

1051
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,619
House.

1052
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,940
There are lots of children here who have

1053
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,940
stepped on landmines.

1054
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,380
Most of them don't have any legs.

1055
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,690
Men have put landmines into fields and under
the roads.

1056
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,800
All the places that

1057
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,020
children go.

1058
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:06,090
I didn't know about landmines, but the other
children tell me about them.

1059
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:10,540
Landmines sit in the ground and when you stand
on them - bang!

1060
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,150
You die or you get very badly hurt.

1061
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,630
Often you lose your legs.

1062
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:24,589
Doctor Nicky says that there are thousands
and thousands of landmines in our country.

1063
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:28,280
When the fighting stops, there will be landmines

1064
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
there.

1065
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,289
So children will be hurt.

1066
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,380
I think about this at night.

1067
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,680
I also think that the fighting is getting
closer.

1068
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,430
You can hear the guns and also bombs.

1069
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:41,740
They're louder than

1070
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,039
the guns.

1071
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:47,770
At night I think of my home.

1072
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,020
It's a very long way away.

1073
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,859
I'm afraid of the bombs and the guns and the
sounds they make.

1074
00:55:55,859 --> 00:55:56,990
I don't want the

1075
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,549
fighting to come here.

1076
00:55:59,549 --> 00:56:02,480
I want Chris to be here.

1077
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,059
I feel safe with him.

1078
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,059
CHAPTER SEVEN

1079
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:14,010
Chris

1080
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,170
Chris is here again.

1081
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,700
He came early this morning.

1082
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,390
He was wearing the same clothes and looked
very dirty.

1083
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,770
But one of the women here has

1084
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,800
washed his clothes and now he looks clean
again.

1085
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:36,039
Chris takes lots of photos of all of us in
the Children's House and in the hospital.

1086
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:38,960
The soldiers are here again, too.

1087
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,260
They don't live at the Children's House, but
some of them come and play football with us.

1088
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,260
Duck likes

1089
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,150
playing football.

1090
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:50,329
He says that he often plays football at home.

1091
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:57,240
Duck tells me that he and the other soldiers
come from a place called Ireland.

1092
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,870
It's near England and it's very green.

1093
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,650
There are lots of

1094
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,080
fields, and lots of chickens and ducks.

1095
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,329
He says that all the soldiers call him Duck
now.

1096
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:11,970
And it's all because of Whitetail and me.

1097
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,329
Whitetail likes Duck.

1098
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:19,359
Duck picks her up and she clucks very happily.

1099
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,619
When the other soldiers are here with Duck,
they sometimes laugh at him.

1100
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:28,460
They shout Duck's name and then they all laugh.

1101
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,540
Chris tells me that 'duck' means two things
in English.

1102
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,440
One is the bird that lives in the water.

1103
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,540
The other is when you get down on the

1104
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,640
ground, when someone shoots a gun at you.

1105
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,020
So the soldiers shout, 'Duck!' and fall on
the ground.

1106
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,569
And then they laugh.

1107
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:51,059
They play games, like me and my brother.

1108
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:54,039
I didn't know that soldiers were like this.

1109
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:58,710
'Are the soldiers going to fight the bad men
across the river?'

1110
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,859
I ask Chris.

1111
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:02,049
'No,' says Chris.

1112
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:04,440
'They aren't here to fight.

1113
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,760
They have come here to try and make the country
safe,' says Chris.

1114
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,420
'They are United Nations

1115
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,420
soldiers.

1116
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:16,010
They will fight only if someone tries to hurt
them.

1117
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,220
The soldiers come from different countries
and they go to other countries to

1118
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,990
stop people fighting.'

1119
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,430
I don't understand.

1120
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:31,830
Chris says that the United Nations means that
lots of countries get together, like my father

1121
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:32,830
did with the other men in

1122
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,830
the village.

1123
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:39,760
They decide all the things that are good and
bad and what the other countries have to do.

1124
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,200
If the other countries don't do

1125
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,140
them, then they send their soldiers.

1126
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,000
He says that the United Nations is called
the UN.

1127
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,200
That's what is written on the side of their

1128
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,200
lorries.

1129
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,830
'But the fighting will stop if the soldiers
kill the bad men,' I say.

1130
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,869
'Then everything will be better.'

1131
00:59:01,869 --> 00:59:05,619
'It's not as easy as that, Jojo,' says Chris.

1132
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:08,970
'Why didn't the soldiers come here before?'

1133
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,150
I ask Chris.

1134
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,940
'Why didn't they come here when the bad men
first crossed the river?

1135
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,940
Before my

1136
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,109
family died?

1137
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:18,690
Before the fires?'

1138
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:24,069
I think I don't like the soldiers so much
now.

1139
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:28,190
'It takes a long time to get the soldiers
ready,' says Chris.

1140
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,740
'And it's never easy to send men a long way.

1141
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,630
The important thing now is to

1142
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,160
stop the fighting.

1143
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,900
There are villages like yours on the other
side of the river, too.

1144
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,500
And children.'

1145
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,859
But I don't believe him.

1146
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:48,520
Chris comes and talks to me every day now.

1147
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,430
He's teaching me to speak English.

1148
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,460
He says I'm very intelligent.

1149
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,900
'What lessons do you like at school?'

1150
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,010
Chris asks me.

1151
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,349
'I like reading,' I answer.

1152
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,789
'I'm reading the two books the soldiers found
in my old school.

1153
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:08,109
They're a bit black from the fire, but you
can

1154
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,780
read some of the pages.

1155
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:16,000
When I build a new school for the village,
I'll use these books,' I tell Chris.

1156
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,099
'When you build your new school, I'll get
new books for you,' says Chris.

1157
01:00:22,099 --> 01:00:25,390
'I'll ask the people who read our newspaper
to give money for

1158
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,660
the books and for the school.'

1159
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,460
But Chris looks sad and I know what he is
thinking.

1160
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:39,829
He thinks I am a child and I don't understand,
but I do understand.

1161
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:43,510
He thinks that there is no one back in the
village, so there will

1162
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,710
never be a school there again.

1163
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:51,370
'There are people from the village who live
in the big town,' I tell Chris.

1164
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:55,640
'They'll come back with their children one
day and we'll build

1165
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,210
the village again.'

1166
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:01,210
I remember all the sounds of the village.

1167
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,450
People laughing and working and talking.

1168
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,950
The people must go back.

1169
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:10,430
I must go back.

1170
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:15,640
When you leave your village, it's like walking
into a big hole.

1171
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,210
You fall and you don't stop falling.

1172
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,660
And if the village is empty, who will

1173
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,660
talk to the ghosts?

1174
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,940
There are many empty villages in my country.

1175
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,609
And many ghosts.

1176
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:36,420
The soldiers have made a big hole in the ground
and Doctor Nicky makes us hide in it when

1177
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,690
the sound of the bombs is very loud.

1178
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,690
All the

1179
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,470
small children cry.

1180
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,030
I want to leave here.

1181
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:52,569
I want to go somewhere where there are no
bombs and no men with guns.

1182
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:58,380
Chris has been here for two weeks and now
he says that he is going away.

1183
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,650
Not just to another village, but back to England.

1184
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,660
He comes to say

1185
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,520
goodbye to me.

1186
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,029
'Please take me home with you to Oxford,'
I ask him.

1187
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:12,119
'I don't mind if you're not there all the
time.

1188
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,980
I'll study and then I'll make money.

1189
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:19,990
I'll make lots of money and come back and
build my village again.'

1190
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:23,279
'I'm sorry, Jojo,' says Chris.

1191
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:26,849
'But I can't take you back to England.'

1192
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:28,430
'Why not?

1193
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,430
I'm very small.

1194
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,880
I don't eat very much.'

1195
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,339
'It's not that.

1196
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,799
This is your country.

1197
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:36,890
This is where you live.

1198
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,130
I can't...'

1199
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,920
He turns away from me.

1200
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,920
'I will try and come back soon,' he says.

1201
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,869
'And I will write to you, Jojo.'

1202
01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:51,530
And he goes.

1203
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,080
I don't want his letters.

1204
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,480
I want him to take me away.

1205
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:04,720
I don't like it here any more.

1206
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,880
CHAPTER EIGHT

1207
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,720
I knew your brother

1208
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,130
It's two weeks since Chris went away.

1209
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,880
The fighting is getting nearer.

1210
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,920
We hear the guns every day now.

1211
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,340
And there are planes in the sky.

1212
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:28,539
They go round and round like the black birds
above my village.

1213
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:30,760
When the planes come, we all get into the

1214
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,529
hole in the ground.

1215
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:36,430
Everyone is afraid of the planes.

1216
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,720
They have bombs.

1217
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,401
Doctor Nicky says that the roof of our house
is white with a big

1218
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,520
red cross.

1219
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,359
That shows the men in the planes that this
is a hospital.

1220
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:55,589
But three days ago a bomb fell into the trees
near the house where all the clothes are washed.

1221
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:58,319
Now it's not safe to go inside there and

1222
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:02,780
the women have to wash the clothes outside.

1223
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:05,280
Doctor Nicky is angry.

1224
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,530
Many of the children can't go anywhere because
they are too sick.

1225
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:15,910
Every day, when the planes come, we have to
hide in the hole.

1226
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:20,730
It's very hot there and my head hurts with
the sound of the guns and the

1227
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,039
small children crying.

1228
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,109
The sound of the guns goes on all night.

1229
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:31,559
It's like the sound of all the trees falling
down.

1230
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:33,559
It makes my ears hurt.

1231
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:36,829
It makes my head hurt.

1232
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:42,420
Then, very early this morning, the guns stopped.

1233
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,359
We went back to our beds and went to sleep.

1234
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:50,119
Today when I wake up, there are lots of men
here.

1235
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,380
They are our soldiers.

1236
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,930
They look very tired.

1237
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,319
Some of them don't have any boots and they

1238
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,150
don't have very much food.

1239
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:05,930
They take some of the food that the UN soldiers
gave us.

1240
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:08,010
The older boys are very noisy.

1241
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,660
They talk to the soldiers.

1242
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,910
Then the soldiers come and talk to all of
us.

1243
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,720
They tell us that we must get

1244
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:23,180
bigger quickly, so that we can be soldiers
like them and fight for our country.

1245
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,660
One of the soldiers comes up to me.

1246
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,990
'I think I know you,' he says.

1247
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:35,060
'Aren't you Jojo, the brother of - ?' And
he says my brother's name.

1248
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,880
'Yes,' I tell him.

1249
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,220
I know who he is now.

1250
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:45,809
He was a friend of my brother's and he came
to our village and stayed with us.

1251
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:48,490
I'm very happy to see him.

1252
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:55,930
He knows my village and when he talks to me,
he talks to me as Jojo who lived in the village.

1253
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,490
With him, I am

1254
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,700
Jojo who had a brother.

1255
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:08,400
I understand now why I feel so strange in
the Children's House.

1256
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,240
It's because here I am not really Jojo.

1257
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,470
When I left my village, I left

1258
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,030
some of myself there.

1259
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,760
I was like a snake.

1260
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,720
I didn't have my old skin, and I didn't have
a new skin.

1261
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,440
My brother's friend asks about my brother.

1262
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,089
I tell him.

1263
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:34,390
I tell him that I am the only one left from
our village.

1264
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,080
He is very angry.

1265
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
My

1266
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,380
brother was a good friend of his.

1267
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,070
He wants to kill the men who killed my brother.

1268
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:46,730
We talk.

1269
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:50,140
He tells me what our soldiers are doing.

1270
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:56,790
And now, talking to my brother's friend, I
feel that I am someone again.

1271
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,819
I am Jojo and I

1272
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:00,200
have a country.

1273
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,819
A country feels like a new skin.

1274
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,550
We talk about his village, too.

1275
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:14,869
He says that it is like my village, but it's
a long way from here and there isn't any fighting.

1276
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:15,869
He says

1277
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:19,010
that he will take me there after the fighting
is finished.

1278
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,339
He says that his family are very nice.

1279
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:23,349
They will be kind to me.

1280
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:24,370
They knew my

1281
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,819
brother, too.

1282
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:28,770
I like him.

1283
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:33,570
He says that he and the other soldiers have
walked for two days without stopping.

1284
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:36,950
They are very tired.

1285
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,160
After we talk, he

1286
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,450
sleeps on the ground.

1287
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,460
I look at his boots.

1288
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,150
They have holes in them.

1289
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,480
His gun is old, too.

1290
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,829
It's a small gun.

1291
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,480
It's not like the big new guns

1292
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,569
the UN soldiers have.

1293
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,410
They have new boots, too.

1294
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:00,059
And they aren't fighting.

1295
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:04,790
Outside the Children's House, some of the
UN soldiers are playing football with the

1296
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,740
older boys.

1297
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,529
I see Duck and he smiles at me.

1298
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:10,970
Dog is

1299
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,490
trying to play football, too.

1300
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,989
I sit and watch them for a while.

1301
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:20,500
Dog runs after the ball and catches it in
his mouth.

1302
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,810
Then he runs away.

1303
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:27,120
Everyone runs after him.

1304
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:33,170
I am sitting by the wall and Duck's gun and
boots are next to me.

1305
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,730
There is no one here to see me.

1306
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:40,549
Very quickly, I pick up the big gun and the
boots.

1307
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,239
They're very heavy.

1308
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:47,230
I take them to my brother's friend and wake
him up.

1309
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:52,219
My brother's friend is very happy when I give
him the gun and the boots.

1310
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:57,630
He gives me his old gun because he says that
I will need it.

1311
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:04,219
He says that our soldiers are going to hide
in the hills and I can go with him.

1312
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:07,750
'You can't stay here now, Jojo,' he says.

1313
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:14,100
'They'll be looking for you when they find
that the gun has gone.'

1314
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,440
I take his old gun.

1315
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,589
It's not very heavy.

1316
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:22,000
I follow him, my brother's friend.

1317
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,609
He talks to one of the other soldiers who
came with him and

1318
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:30,679
then he goes through the house and out of
the door at the back.

1319
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:37,130
There are trees near there and very soon no
one can see us.

1320
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,850
I think of Chris as I go.

1321
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:46,690
His letters will go to the Children's House,
but I won't be there.

1322
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,060
I was a boy when I met Chris.

1323
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,710
That was then.

1324
01:09:51,710 --> 01:10:25,860
Now I have a gun and I'm a man.
