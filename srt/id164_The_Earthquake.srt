CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:17,170
Two Tickets

3
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,370
Gabriel had a kind face and intelligent brown
eyes.

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,860
He usually had a friendly smile.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,500
But there was no smile on his face today.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,570
He wasn't happy.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,359
'I'd like to be as rich as Marco,' he thought.

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,030
'But I'm only good old Gabriel.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,550
Silvia likes me.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,900
I know she does.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,329
She thinks I'm kind and nice.

12
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,110
But she thinks I'm boring, too.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,980
Boring old Gabriel, that's me.'

14
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,130
Gabriel had two tickets for a film.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,899
There was a red rose on the table in his sitting-room.

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,030
He took the rose and the tickets and went
out.

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,870
An hour later, Gabriel arrived at the door
of Silvia's flat.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,100
When she opened the door, she didn't smile
at him.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,880
'Oh, hello,' she said.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,900
'What... er...?'

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,110
'Don't you remember, Silvia?' said Gabriel.

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,110
'It's Sunday evening.

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,150
We're going to the cinema.

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,380
I've got the tickets.

25
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,330
It's that great new film.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,560
You said...'

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,040
'What do you mean?' said Silvia.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,400
'I can't go out with you this evening.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm busy.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,560
1 don't remember

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,320
'But I called you on Thursday!'

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Gabriel said.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,810
'You wanted to come!'

34
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:00,460
Silvia pushed her beautiful dark hair out
of her eyes.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,530
She didn't look at Gabriel.

36
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,230
'Oh dear,' she said.

37
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,450
'That was stupid of me.

38
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm really sorry.

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,010
Please don't be angry, Gabriel.

40
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,010
Come back tomorrow.

41
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,349
We'll go to the film tomorrow.'

42
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,430
She began to shut the door.

43
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:31,302
'Silvia,' Gabriel said angrily, 'you're going
out with Marco!

44
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:32,302
I know you are!

45
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,320
I want to tell you something about Marco.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
He's rich, but he's a bad man.

47
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
You're being stupid, Silvia.'

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
He stopped.

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Silvia wasn't there.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
'I'm talking to the door,' he thought angrily.

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
He looked at the rose in his hand.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Then he threw it onto the ground.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Behind him, he heard a quiet laugh.

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
He turned.

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
There was a man on the stairs.

56
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
His clothes were expensive, and there were
twenty red roses in his hand.

57
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
It was Marco.

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
'Oh dear, Gabriel,' Marco laughed.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
'Is she busy tonight?

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
Doesn't she want to go out with you?

61
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
I'll try now.

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Perhaps she'll go out with me'

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Gabriel didn't answer.

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
He walked quickly away and went down to the
street.

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
It was a hot Sunday evening.

66
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
There was no wind.

67
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
A lot of people were in the street.

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
They sat in the parks and drank in the cafes.

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Young men and women talked and laughed.

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Gabriel didn't want to look at them.

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
He felt too unhappy.

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
He took out the two tickets.

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
'I paid for them,' he thought, 'and it's a
wonderful film.

74
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll go without her!

75
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm not going to think about Silvia Delgado.

76
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I'll go and see the film, and I'll enjoy it.'

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
The Plaza cinema was a big, old building in
the centre of town.

78
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
The doors weren't open, so there were a lot
of people outside.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Gabriel waited with them.

80
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
When the doors opened, people went quickly
inside to the ticket office.

81
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
But Gabriel had his ticket, so he waited outside.

82
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
It was 8.27 p.m.

83
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
And at that minute, the earthquake happened.

84
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
CHAPTER TWO

85
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
A Table for Two

86
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Marco stood at the door of Silvia's flat and
watched Gabriel leaving.

87
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
He looked carefully at his clothes and his
shoes.

88
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Why didn't Silvia open the door?

89
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
She was in there.

90
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,010
Then, suddenly, it opened.

91
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,500
'Silvia dear,' Marco said, 'you look wonderful...'

92
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,040
He stopped.

93
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,799
Silvia didn't look wonderful.

94
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,389
Her face was red, and she looked unhappy.

95
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,250
'Gabriel said something to her,' Marco thought.

96
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,169
'What was it?

97
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:50,659
That young man doesn't like me, and I don't
like him.'

98
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,709
He followed Silvia into the sitting-room.

99
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,159
'I'm nearly ready,' she said.

100
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,969
'Have a drink.

101
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:02,159
I'll come in a minute.'

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,959
Marco knew the Delgado's sitting-room well.

103
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,939
He went to the table, and got a drink.

104
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,659
Then he sat down in an expensive armchair.

105
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,829
He liked the flat.

106
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:24,780
There were beautiful pictures on the walls,
and everything in the room looked very expensive.

107
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,300
Silvia lived with her mother.

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,139
Her father was dead.

109
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,009
Before he died, Mr Delgado had a good job.

110
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,660
He had cars and friends and a lot of money.

111
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,319
But the Delgado's weren't a rich family now,
and Silvia's mother was ill.

112
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,759
The doctor often came and visited her.

113
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,669
Sometimes, Mrs Delgado had to go to hospital.

114
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,340
She had to have good food and expensive medicines.

115
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,280
The Delgado's didn't have much money now.

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,030
Marco didn't know about the Delgado's money.

117
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:16,600
He saw their pictures, their jewellery and
other expensive things, and he liked them

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
all.

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
'Silvia!'

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,960
Mrs Delgado called weakly from her bedroom.

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,780
'Are you there, dear?

122
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,599
What are you doing?

123
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,420
Is somebody with you?

124
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,539
Who is it?'

125
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,360
Marco heard Silvia's answer.

126
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,659
It's all right, mother,' she said.

127
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,759
'It's only Gabriel.

128
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,949
We're going to see a film.'

129
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:43,949
'Ah!'

130
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:44,949
thought Marco.

131
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,229
'So Mrs Delgado doesn't like me!

132
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,060
Mrs Delgado likes dear Gabriel!'

133
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,599
He went back to the table and had another
drink.

134
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:59,150
'Perhaps you don't like me, Mrs Delgado,'
Marco thought.

135
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,610
'But your daughter does.

136
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,849
Oh, yes.

137
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,660
She likes me very much.'

138
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,530
He smiled.

139
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,740
Ten minutes later, Silvia came into the room
again.

140
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,860
Her dark hair was beautiful.

141
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,340
Her big, brown eyes were excited.

142
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,650
Her dress was very pretty.

143
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,640
She smiled happily.

144
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,290
'Hello, Marco,' she said.

145
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,270
'I'm ready now.'

146
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,180
He put down his glass and stood up.

147
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,120
'We're going to have a wonderful, wonderful
evening,' he said.

148
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,850
Outside, it was very hot.

149
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,949
Marco drove his car fast.

150
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,560
Silvia felt the wind in her hair.

151
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,009
It was good.

152
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:03,960
'Gabriel hasn't got a car,' thought Silvia.

153
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:12,900
She turned and looked at Marco.

154
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,009
'Where are we going?'

155
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,060
she asked.

156
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,949
'I'm taking you to the Oasis Restaurant,'
Marco said.

157
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,880
'It's the best restaurant in town.

158
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,729
It's very expensive, of course, but nothing
is too good for you, Silvia.

159
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,819
I know a lot of girls, but you're the most
beautiful.'

160
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,700
The Oasis Restaurant was two kilometres outside
the town.

161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,460
There were a lot of big cars outside it.

162
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,660
Marco pushed open the doors.

163
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,440
Inside, it was nearly dark.

164
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:09,249
There were pretty little lights on the tables,
and a man played quiet music.

165
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:10,249
Some people danced.

166
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,249
'Good evening, sir,' the manager said to Marco.

167
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,219
'I called this afternoon,' said Marco.

168
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:16,169
'I want a table for two.'

169
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,169
'Of course.

170
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,099
Please follow me,' the manager said.

171
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,770
Marco and Silvia followed him to the back
of the restaurant.

172
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,580
Their table was near the door to the kitchen.

173
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,129
Waiters went in and out with food and drink.

174
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,930
Marco looked at the manager angrily.

175
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,620
'I don't want this table,' he said.

176
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,500
'We're going to dance later.

177
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,240
We want to be near the dancing.

178
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
I have to have a better table.'

179
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
'I'm sorry, sir,' said the manager.'

180
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I can't do that.

181
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,370
We're busy this evening.

182
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,870
Come early next time.

183
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,760
Then I can put you near the dancing.'

184
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,060
He began to walk away.

185
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,370
'Wait a minute,' said Marco.

186
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,680
'I'm not happy with this.

187
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,060
You've got to...'

188
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,850
'I'm very sorry,' said the manager again.

189
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,899
'I can't give you a better table now.

190
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:05,899
Later, perhaps...'

191
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:06,899
'But...' said Marco.

192
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,079
People began to turn round and look at Marco.

193
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,860
Silvia looked at the floor.

194
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,089
Marco always did this.

195
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:21,040
He always wanted the best place in the restaurant,
in the theatre or at the football game.

196
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,930
Silvia put her hand on Marco's arm.

197
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,000
'This table's OK,' she said.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
'I don't want to change.

199
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Why...?'

200
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,839
'Be quiet, my dear,' said Marco.

201
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,649
'Leave this to me.'

202
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,889
He turned back to the manager.

203
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,510
'Now,' he said, 'you listen to me.'

204
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,760
'Everybody's watching us now,' thought Silvia.

205
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,810
She caught his arm again.

206
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:52,070
'I'll see you in a minute,' she said.

207
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,880
'I'm going to the washroom.'

208
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:03,860
She walked between the tables to a door at
the other end of the restaurant.

209
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,010
She saw young men and women dancing.

210
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,440
Older people laughed and talked.

211
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,980
They all looked happy.

212
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,970
The washroom was outside the restaurant, in
a small garden.

213
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,780
Silvia opened the door and walked into the
garden.

214
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,579
It was 8.27 p.m.

215
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,550
And at that minute, the earthquake happened.

216
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,790
CHAPTER THREE

217
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,029
Silvia's Story

218
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:36,870
The ground moved under Silvia's feet.

219
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,870
'Help!

220
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,079
What is it?

221
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,180
What's happening?'

222
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,279
she thought.

223
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,800
There was a terrible noise, and she looked
up into the sky.

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:53,519
Perhaps the noise and the shaking came from
a plane.

225
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:02,940
Suddenly, the lights went out, and it was
nearly dark.

226
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
Then people started to scream.

227
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,500
Silvia didn't move.

228
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,230
She couldn't move.

229
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,110
'It's an earthquake,' she thought.

230
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,410
'Oh, no, please, no!'

231
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,720
The ground moved again.

232
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:24,519
A long crack started to run up from the bottom
of the wall in front of her to the top.

233
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:32,040
Then the wall opened, and Silvia could see
the people inside the restaurant.

234
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,190
They tried to run.

235
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,350
Their screams were terrible.

236
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,130
She could see hands pushing and pulling.

237
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,449
She could see their faces and their eyes.

238
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,610
They were terribly afraid.

239
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,890
Then the wall fell, and the roof came down.

240
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,110
Silvia couldn't see the faces and hands now.

241
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,250
The Oasis Restaurant wasn't there.

242
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,829
It was only rubble.

243
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,449
Silvia couldn't move.

244
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,070
She couldn't scream.

245
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,690
'Marco's in there!'

246
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,769
she thought.

247
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:07,889
'Marco, and the manager, and... and those
people.

248
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:08,889
They...

249
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:09,899
Oh, I can't...

250
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:10,910
I don't...'

251
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,430
There was another loud noise behind her.

252
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,440
Silvia turned.

253
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,950
Another building fell.

254
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,950
And another.

255
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,950
And another.

256
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,950
Suddenly, she remembered her mother.

257
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,519
Silvia tried to get out of the garden into
the street, but it wasn't easy.

258
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,480
She had to climb over a broken wall.

259
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,230
She couldn't climb in her evening shoes.

260
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,510
She took them off and carried them in her
hand.

261
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,720
She got up to the top of the wall and fell
down into the street.

262
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,460
Her pretty dress was dirty now, and she had
cuts on her feet.

263
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,019
There were people everywhere.

264
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,970
They ran up and down the street and screamed.

265
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,130
Some people tried to pull the rubble away
from a building.

266
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,660
'Come and help!'

267
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,760
one of them said to Silvia.

268
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,710
'My little boy's under there.

269
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,880
Help me, please!'

270
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,630
'I'm sorry,' said Silvia.

271
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,839
'I have to find my mother.'

272
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,350
There were cars everywhere, too.

273
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:15,000
Everybody wanted to get away from the buildings
and out into the country.

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
'Stop!

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,079
Take me with you!

276
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,519
Take me home!'

277
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,779
she screamed at them.

278
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,860
But they didn't hear her.

279
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,300
They didn't stop.

280
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,220
'I'll have to walk,' she thought.

281
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,500
It's a long way, but I can do it.

282
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,779
I have to go home and help my mother.

283
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,209
I have to!'

284
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,120
Silvia began to run.

285
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,540
It wasn't easy.

286
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,139
There was rubble across the road.

287
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,389
A roof fell to the ground behind her.

288
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,690
A wall suddenly fell in front of her.

289
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:07,069
She climbed over it, and started to run again.

290
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,250
It wasn't dark now.

291
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:19,170
The sky was red and black with fires and thick,
black smoke, Silvia had only one idea in her

292
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,430
head.

293
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,260
There was nobody with her mother.

294
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,440
She was ill in her bed.

295
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
She couldn't move easily.

296
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Perhaps she was hurt.

297
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,720
Perhaps she was...

298
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
'No!'

299
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
thought Silvia.

300
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
'She's not dead!

301
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,380
Oh, please, no, please!

302
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,779
She's all right.

303
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,240
I know she is!

304
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Mother!

305
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Mother!'

306
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,010
She was in the centre of town now.

307
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,300
She looked round the square.

308
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,330
There were some houses, and the big church
clock showed the right time.

309
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,930
But the hotel next to it was only a ruin.

310
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,640
The Plaza was in the same square.

311
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,130
For the first time, Silvia stopped and watched.

312
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,300
Firemen and policemen carried people out of
the cinema.

313
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,910
'What happened?'

314
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,660
she asked a girl.

315
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,120
'The roof fell,' the girl said.

316
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,670
'Hundreds of people are dead.'

317
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,519
'Perhaps Gabriel didn't go,' thought Silvia.

318
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:22,490
'Or perhaps he came too late, or ...' She
didn't want to think about Gabriel now.

319
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,509
The idea was too terrible.

320
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:31,040
The Delgado's building was near the town centre,
at the end of a street.

321
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,670
Silvia began to run again.

322
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,630
She could see a big fire.

323
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,260
She could hear people screaming.

324
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,279
The building next to the Delgado's home was
a ruin.

325
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,149
Men and women pulled at the rubble.

326
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,290
Silvia knew them.

327
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,810
They were her neighbors.

328
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,690
They wanted to find their families and friends.

329
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,420
But the Delgado's building was there.

330
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:04,129
There was a big crack in the front wall, and
some windows were broken.

331
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,839
But the building looked safe.

332
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,730
'Hey, don't go in there!'

333
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,610
a man called to Silvia.

334
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,339
'It's too dangerous!'

335
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,649
But Silvia didn't stop.

336
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:24,899
She pushed open the door and went in Inside,
it was dark.

337
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,180
She tried the lights, but they didn't work.

338
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,330
Quickly, she ran up the stairs to the flat.

339
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,740
The front door was open.

340
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
'Mother!'

341
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
she called.

342
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,900
'Are you all right?

343
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,090
It's me!

344
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,470
Mother, where are you?'

345
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,040
She went to her mother's bedroom.

346
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,810
The door was open, but there was nobody in
the bed.

347
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,839
Mrs Delgado wasn't there.

348
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,839
CHAPTER FOUR

349
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:56,839
Neighbours

350
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,139
Silvia sat down on her mother's bed and cried.

351
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,139
'Where is she?'

352
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,139
she thought.

353
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,139
'Who's with her?

354
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,139
What can I do?'

355
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,139
She stood up.

356
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:05,559
Her feet hurt, so she went to her bedroom
for some better shoes.

357
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,939
She started to take off her dress, but then
she heard another loud noise.

358
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,939
Another building fell.

359
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,650
'I can't stay here inside the building,' she
thought.

360
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,650
'It's too dangerous.'

361
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,880
She went quickly out of the flat and down
into the street.

362
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Then she stopped.

363
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
'Where can I go?

364
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
What can I do?'

365
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
she thought.

366
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
First, she had to find her mother.

367
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
After that - but no, she didn't want to think
about Marco.

368
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
He was in the ruins of the Oasis Restaurant.

369
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
And she couldn't think about Gabriel.

370
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Perhaps he was in the ruins of the Plaza cinema.

371
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Suddenly, she saw a neighbour.

372
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
The old man lived in the next building.

373
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
She went to him and put her hand on his arm.

374
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
'Oh, Mr Enrique's,' she said.

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
'You're safe.'

376
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
The old man didn't move.

377
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
He didn't see or hear her.

378
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
His face was white and his hands shook.

379
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
He started to cry quietly.

380
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
Silvia shook his arm.

381
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
'Mr Enrique's!'

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
she said.

383
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
'It's me, Silvia Delgado.

384
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Where's my mother?

385
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
She's not in our flat.

386
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
You know she can't walk.

387
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Did somebody take her?

388
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Who?

389
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Where did they go?'

390
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
The old man turned and looked at her.

391
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,860
'Silvia - Mrs Delgado - I don't know,' he
said.

392
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,170
'I can't remember.

393
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,870
There was something - yes, I think...

394
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,559
perhaps it was Mr Garcia.

395
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,960
Yes, Mr Garcia, the man from the second floor
in your building.

396
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,900
He carried her down and put her in his car.

397
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,130
Yes, that's it.

398
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,770
It was Mr Garcia.'

399
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,220
'But where are they?' said Silvia.

400
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,860
'Where did they go?'

401
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,110
'He said something,' said the old man.

402
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,230
'I don't remember.

403
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,659
He said, 'Tell Silvia...'

404
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,100
'Tell me what?

405
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,010
Please remember, Mr Enrique's.

406
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,010
Please!'

407
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,270
'He said... er... something about a park,'
said Mr Enrique's.

408
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,190
'Yes, that was it.

409
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,760
"It's safe in the park," he said.

410
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,870
He wanted to go away from the buildings.

411
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,870
Past the river.

412
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,870
To Liberty Park.'

413
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,870
Silvia looked at Mr. Enrique's sad, old face
and put her arm round him.

414
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,870
'Thank you, oh, thank you,' she said.

415
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,870
'I'll come back later.

416
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,870
I'll help you then.'

417
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,870
'Help me?

418
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
You can't help me,' said Mr Enrique's.

419
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,870
'I haven't got anything now.

420
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,870
My wife, my home...'

421
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,870
Liberty Park was outside the town, past the
football ground.

422
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,870
Silvia started to walk.

423
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,870
Then she stopped.

424
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,870
Her mother was old and ill.

425
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,870
She had to take her medicines.

426
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,870
And they were on the table next to her mother's
bed.

427
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,870
It was dangerous, but Silvia didn't think
about it.

428
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,870
She ran back into the flat.

429
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,280
She found a big bag and put into it some warm
clothes and her mother's medicine bottles.

430
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,760
Then she ran outside again and shut the door
behind her.

431
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,059
It was a long way to Liberty Park.

432
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,600
Silvia started walking.

433
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,640
CHAPTER FIVE

434
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,670
Gabriel's Story

435
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,060
At the time of the earthquake, Gabriel was
outside the Plaza.

436
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,440
A lot of people wanted to buy their tickets,
and they went inside.

437
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
But he had his ticket.

438
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
He was safe because he waited outside.

439
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,340
Gabriel heard the first sounds of the earthquake.

440
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:29,090
But he didn't see the buildings when they
fell.

441
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,780
He didn't hear the screams.

442
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,179
Some rubble hit him on the head and he fell
to the ground.

443
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,320
Alter a long time, he heard somebody.

444
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,690
It was a woman.

445
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,710
'Look at this young man,' the woman said.

446
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,150
'Is he dead?'

447
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,520
'No,' said another woman, 'but he's hurt.'

448
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,409
'I'm - I'm all right,' said Gabriel.

449
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,510
He tried to sit up.

450
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,510
The women moved away.

451
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
Gabriel's arm hurt terribly.

452
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,510
He couldn't move it.

453
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,510
It was broken.

454
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,510
He sat in the street.

455
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,240
Then he stood up slowly, and looked round.

456
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
It was nearly dark.

457
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,289
Only the cars gave some light.

458
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,230
'My family!' he thought.

459
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,230
'Mum!

460
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,230
Dad!'

461
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,540
But they were a long way away in another town.

462
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,669
He couldn't do anything for them.

463
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,190
Then he thought of Silvia.

464
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,210
She was with Marco.

465
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,230
He couldn't help her.

466
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,770
But there was nobody with Mrs Delgado.

467
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,770
And she was ill.

468
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,670
'I'll go back to the Delgado's flat,' thought
Gabriel.

469
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,590
'I can help Mrs Delgado, and perhaps I'll
hear news of Silvia.'

470
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,730
Slowly, he started to walk.

471
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,730
He felt terribly weak.

472
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,730
His right arm hurt very badly, and his head,
too.

473
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,730
Sometimes he nearly fell.

474
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,730
Hundreds of people were in the street.

475
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,730
A woman ran into Gabriel.

476
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,730
By accident, she hit his arm.

477
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,730
It hurt terribly.

478
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,730
He sat down in the road.

479
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,730
Everything went black.

480
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,730
When Gabriel opened his eyes again, he felt
very ill.

481
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,730
He tried to sit up and look round.

482
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,730
He wasn't in the street now.

483
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,730
He was on the ground with a lot of other people.

484
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,289
Doctors and nurses moved quietly round them.

485
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,289
He tried to feel his head with his hand.

486
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,289
Then he remembered his arm.

487
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,289
A nurse came to him.

488
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,289
'Where am I?

489
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,289
What happened?' he said.

490
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:52,289
'You're in the garden of the hospital,' she
said.

491
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,289
'Your arm's broken, I'm afraid.

492
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,289
And you've got a bad cut on your head, too.

493
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,289
We can't do more for you now.

494
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,549
Thousands of people are waiting for help,
and we haven't got medicines for all of them.

495
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,980
It's not safe inside the hospital, but don't
worry.

496
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
You'll be all right here.

497
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Stay here quietly and sleep.'

498
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
She went away.

499
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Gabriel watched her.

500
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Then he remembered Silvia.

501
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
He had to go and find her.

502
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
He had to help Mrs Delgado.

503
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Slowly, he stood up.

504
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
He was weak, but he could walk.

505
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
The doctors and nurses didn't see him.

506
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
They were too busy.

507
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Gabriel left the hospital and started to walk
back into town.

508
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
CHAPTER SIX

509
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Liberty Park

510
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Silvia didn't like walking.

511
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
She usually caught a bus or took a taxi.

512
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
She was tired, and her back hurt.

513
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
But she didn't think about her back, or about
the cuts on her feet.

514
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
She was with a lot of other people.

515
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
They all had the same idea.

516
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
They wanted to leave the town and go into
the country, away from the dangerous high

517
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
buildings.

518
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,980
A friendly woman talked to Silvia.

519
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
'Isn't anybody with you, dear?'

520
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,980
she said.

521
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
'Where's your family?'

522
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
'There's only my mother,' said Silvia.

523
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
'I think she's at Liberty Park.

524
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
I'm going to look for her.'

525
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
'Don't worry, you'll find her,' the woman
said kindly.

526
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Silvia felt better.

527
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
'Did you see the Grand Hotel?' said a man.

528
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
'It's a ruin.

529
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
Hundreds of people were inside it.'

530
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,980
'It's terrible, terrible,' his wife said.

531
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
'I saw a baby...'

532
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
She stopped.

533
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
'And the shopping centre,' another woman said.

534
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
'The shoe shop is all right, but the supermarket
is a ruin.'

535
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
'The center's bad,' said a man, 'but it's
worse east of here.

536
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
I was out there when the earthquake happened.'

537
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
'Near the station?'

538
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
the kind woman asked.

539
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
'No, near the Oasis Restaurant,' the man said.

540
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
Silvia started to listen more carefully.

541
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
'The Oasis is a lovely place,' somebody said.

542
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
'Is it all right?'

543
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
'No,' the man said.

544
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
'It's a ruin.

545
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
A lot of people are dead.

546
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
But the manager was all right.

547
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
He was at the back of the restaurant.

548
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
It was better there.

549
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
He'll be all right.

550
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
I wanted to help the other people, but I was
worried about my family.

551
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
So I came back into town.

552
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,980
We're all safe.

553
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
But our home...'

554
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
He stopped talking.

555
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
Silvia turned to him.

556
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
'Excuse me,' she said.

557
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
'There was a man in the restaurant - the manager
was with him when - when... the earthquake...

558
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Do you know - is he all right?'

559
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
'Yes,' said the man.

560
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
'He's all right.

561
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
I pulled him out.

562
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
A tall, dark man.

563
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
Is that him?'

564
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
'Yes,' said Silvia.

565
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
The man laughed.

566
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
'Don't worry about him,' he said.

567
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,980
'He's fine.

568
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
My friend and I worked hard.

569
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
We pulled him from the rubble, but did he
say, "Thank you"?

570
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,980
No, he didn't!

571
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
He was only worried about his car.

572
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
He didn't help the other people under the
rubble.

573
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
He only had small cuts on his face and hands,
but he wanted to see a doctor.

574
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Other people were dead or nearly dead, but
he wasn't interested in them.

575
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
I'm sorry...

576
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
Is he your friend?

577
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
But really...'

578
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Silvia didn't answer him.

579
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
She wanted to think.

580
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Marco wasn't dead!

581
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
She was very happy about that, of course.

582
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
But she understood now.

583
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
She was stupid.

584
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
A stupid, stupid girl.

585
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
She didn't love Marco.

586
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
She didn't like him.

587
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,980
She loved Gabriel.

588
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
And now, perhaps, it was too late.

589
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
At midnight, there was another small earthquake.

590
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
The people in the road screamed.

591
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
They wanted to run - but where could they
go?

592
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Behind them, in the town, more buildings fell.

593
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
'Oh, no,' thought Silvia.

594
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
'When will this end?'

595
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
At 12.30 a.m.

596
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Silvia arrived at Liberty Park.

597
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
She looked round.

598
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
There were thousands of people on the ground.

599
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Other people stood and talked.

600
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
She couldn't see very well in the thick smoke.

601
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
'I'll never find Mother here,' thought Silvia.

602
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
She began to walk up and down the park.

603
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
'Mother!'

604
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,980
she called.

605
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
'Mother, it's me, Silvia!

606
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Where are you?'

607
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
After an hour, she was very tired.

608
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
'I have to sit down,' she thought.

609
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
'I'll start again in the morning.

610
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
But now I'm going to sleep somewhere.'

611
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Then suddenly, she heard her name.

612
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
She turned round.

613
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
'Mr Garcia!'

614
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
she said.

615
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
'Where's Mother?'

616
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
'She's here,' said Mr Garcia, 'and she's all
right.

617
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
But she's very worried about you.

618
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
My wife's with her now.

619
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
How did you find us?'

620
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
'It's a long story,' said Silvia.

621
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
'I'll tell you later.

622
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
But now ...'

623
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
'I know,' said Mr Garcia.

624
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
'You want your mother.

625
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Come with me.'

626
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
Mrs Delgado was on the ground with Mr Garcia's
jacket under her head.

627
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Her eyes were open, but her face was white.

628
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
'Silvia, my dear, you're safe,' she said,
and took Silvia's hand.

629
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
'I'm happy now, I'm very happy...'

630
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Silvia took her mother's medicines out of
the bag, and gave her some.

631
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Mrs Delgado smiled.

632
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
'Thank you, dear,' she said.

633
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Silvia sat and watched her.

634
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Mrs Delgado shut her eyes and slept.

635
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
CHAPTER SEVEN

636
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Thieves

637
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
It was early in the morning when Gabriel arrived
at the Delgado's flat.

638
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
His arm hurt badly, and he was terribly thirsty.

639
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
The street was quieter now.

640
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Most people were out in the country, or in
the parks outside the town.

641
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
But there were four or five men at work in
the ruins of the building next door.

642
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
They pulled the rubble away.

643
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Gabriel watched them for a minute.

644
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Suddenly, they stopped working and listened.

645
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
'I can hear something!'

646
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
one man said.

647
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
'Here!

648
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
I think it's a child.

649
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Quick!

650
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Come and help!'

651
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Gabriel went to them.

652
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
'I can help,' he said.

653
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
One of them looked up and smiled at him.

654
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
'Don't be stupid,' he said.

655
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
'You've got to have two hands for this job.

656
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
Go and sit down.'

657
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Slowly, Gabriel went up the stairs to the
Delgado's flat.

658
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
The building was dangerous, but he didn't
think about that.

659
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
He could hear the cries of the child.

660
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
He felt terrible.

661
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,980
Then he felt something on the floor under
his foot.

662
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
He looked down.

663
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
It was his red rose.

664
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
It was there, in the same place, by the front
door.

665
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
A rose from another world, another life.

666
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
The door of the flat was open.

667
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
Gabriel called, 'Mrs Delgado!

668
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
Silvia!

669
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Are you there?'

670
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
There was no answer, but suddenly, two men
ran out of the sitting-room.

671
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
The first man went down the stairs before
Gabriel could stop him.

672
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
Then the other man ran past.

673
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Gabriel put out his foot and the man fell
over it.

674
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
A box fell to the ground.

675
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
The man didn't stop.

676
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
He jumped up and ran away.

677
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Gabriel opened the box.

678
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
There was jewellery inside it.

679
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
'Mrs. Delgado's jewellery!' he thought.

680
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
'So the thieves are busy now!'

681
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,980
He took the jewellery box into the flat.

682
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
He looked round.

683
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
The pictures were on the walls.

684
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Silvia's camera was on the table.

685
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
'Good,' he thought.

686
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
'The thieves didn't have much time.

687
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
They only took the jewellery, and I've got
it now.'

688
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
Then, near one of the armchairs, he saw Silvia's
dirty evening shoes.

689
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
He thought for a minute.

690
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
For the first time for hours, he smiled.

691
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
'She wore those shoes last night,' he thought.

692
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
'So she came back here after the earthquake.

693
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
She isn't dead!

694
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
She came home, and took her mother to a safe
place.

695
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Oh Silvia, Silvia, you're all right!'

696
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Gabriel forgot his broken arm, and the cut
on his head.

697
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
He was suddenly happy.

698
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
'I'll look for them,' he thought.

699
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
They're out in the country.

700
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
I know they are.

701
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
I'll find them.

702
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
I'll...'

703
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
He stopped.

704
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
'That's stupid,' he thought.

705
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
'I'll never find them.

706
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
And I can't leave.

707
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
There'll be other thieves later.

708
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
I'll stay here and look after the flat.'

709
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
He went into the kitchen.

710
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
There was no water, of course, but there was
some milk.

711
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Gabriel had a long, long drink and then felt
better.

712
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
His head and his arm hurt, but his legs felt
stronger.

713
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
And now he could think.

714
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
'It's not safe inside,' he thought.

715
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
'I'll stay in the street.

716
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Perhaps I can help the other men, and watch
the building too.'

717
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
He went out of the flat, and shut the door
behind him.

718
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,980
That day and the next day, Gabriel worked
with the other men.

719
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
He couldn't move the rubble, or pull people
out of the ruins.

720
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
But he could do other jobs.

721
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
The workers had to have food and drink.

722
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Gabriel found water and carried it to them.

723
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Then he looked for food.

724
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,980
There was a shop at the end of the street.

725
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
The windows and doors were broken.

726
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
There was nobody there.

727
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
'The manager's dead,' a man told him.

728
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
Gabriel climbed through the broken door into
the shop.

729
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
He took some food and carried it back to the
workers.

730
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
The child from the ruins of the next building
was safe now.

731
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
She was in a car, on her way to hospital.

732
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
But the workers didn't stop working.

733
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
Other people were under the rubble.

734
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Gabriel could hear their screams.

735
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
He saw a small boy in the street, two or three
years old.

736
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,980
The child cried for his mother.

737
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
'She's at the hospital,' one of the workers
said.

738
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
'We pulled her out.

739
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
We didn't know about the child.'

740
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Gabriel sat down next to the little boy and
talked to him.

741
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
He gave him some food and a drink of water.

742
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
Slowly, the child stopped crying.

743
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Gabriel played with him for hours.

744
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,980
Then his father came and took him away.

745
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
On the morning of the third day, firemen arrived.

746
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
For the first time, Gabriel stopped working.

747
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,980
He couldn't do anything now.

748
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
He sat down in front of the Delgado's door
and fell asleep.

749
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
CHAPTER EIGHT

750
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Home

751
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
On the third day after the earthquake, good
news came to Liberty Park.

752
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
Mr Garcia had a radio in his car.

753
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
'Silvia, come and listen!' he called to her.

754
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,980
'There will not be another earthquake,' the
newsreader said.

755
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
'People can go back to their homes.

756
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
Dangerous buildings have a white cross on
the door.

757
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Do not go inside those buildings.

758
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Other buildings are safe.

759
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I will say that again...'

760
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Mr Garcia and Silvia listened again.

761
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Then Mr Garcia turned the radio off.

762
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
'Do you think it's really safe?'

763
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Silvia asked.

764
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
'Do you think we can go home?'

765
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
Mr Garcia shook his head.

766
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
'I don't know,' he said.

767
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
'But I know one thing.

768
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Your mother can't stay here.

769
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
We'll take her home to her bed.

770
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,980
You can look after her there.'

771
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Everywhere in Liberty Park people asked questions.

772
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Many people were worried.

773
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Was the newsreader right?

774
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
They were afraid of another earthquake.

775
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
They wanted to stay in the country for another
day or two.

776
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
But other people wanted to go home.

777
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
They started to move into the streets.

778
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Silvia sat down next to her mother.

779
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
'We're going home, Mother,' she said.

780
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Mr Garcia carried Mrs Delgado carefully to
his car.

781
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
She was as light as a child.

782
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Silvia opened the back door of the car, and
Mr Garcia put Mrs Delgado inside.

783
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,980
The journey into town took a long time.

784
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,980
There was rubble everywhere, and in some places
there were trees across the road.

785
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Mr and Mrs Garcia sat in the front of the
car and talked.

786
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
They were worried about their flat, their
friends and their neighbors.

787
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Silvia sat in the back with her mother and
looked out of the window.

788
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
But she didn't see the ruins, or the rubble,
or the firemen.

789
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
She didn't hear the Garcias.

790
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
'Will I see Gabriel again?'

791
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
she thought.

792
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
The car turned into the Delgado's street and
stopped outside their building.

793
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
'Look!

794
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
Look!

795
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
It isn't there!' said Mrs Garcia.

796
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
'What isn't there?' asked Silvia.

797
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
'The white cross!

798
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
There's no white cross on our building.

799
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
It's safe!

800
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
We can go home!'

801
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Mrs Garcia jumped out of the car and ran up
the stairs to her flat.

802
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Mr Garcia smiled at Silvia.

803
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,980
'You go up first and open the door,' he said.

804
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
'My wife will come back in a minute.

805
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Then we'll carry your mother up the stairs.'

806
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,980
Silvia went into the building and up the stairs.

807
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Then she stopped.

808
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
There was a man asleep in front of her door.

809
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
He looked thin and ill.

810
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,980
His face and clothes were dirty.

811
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
And his arm... his head...

812
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
'Gabriel!'

813
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
she said.

814
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Gabriel woke up and jumped to his feet.

815
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
He didn't see Silvia in the dark.

816
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
He only saw another thief!

817
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
'You can't come in here,' he said.

818
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
'This is the Delgado's home.

819
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
No thieves here...'

820
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
'Gabriel,' said Silvia again.

821
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Gabriel stopped talking.

822
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
His head was hot.

823
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
His legs felt weak.

824
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
He didn't want to fall now.

825
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Not now.

826
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
'Is it you?' he said.

827
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
'Is it really you?'

828
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
He had something in his hand Silvia couldn't
see it very well.

829
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Then she understood.

830
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
It was a dirty, dead, red rose.

831
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
She took it out of his hand.

832
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,980
'Thank you, Gabriel,' she said.

833
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:35,982
'It's beautiful.'
