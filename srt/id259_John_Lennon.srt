00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,960
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,920
A man with a dream

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,120
On a warm, sunny day in June 1957, six 
young men stood in Rosebery Street,  

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,400
Liverpool, and began to play a song.

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,520
The band was called The Quarrymen.

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,360
They were not famous, and in 
1957, they were not very good!

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:54,360
The singer had brown eyes and brown 
hair, and his name was John Lennon.

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:03,080
He sang song after song, the 
band played, and people danced.

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,760
Nobody in the street that 
day knew the singer's name.

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
But he was a man with a dream.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,240
'One day, I'm going to be famous,' he often said.

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,040
And he was right.

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,920
The Quarrymen slowly became The 
Beatles, and seven years later,  

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,120
they were the world's most famous band.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,920
Before he died, John Lennon wrote and 
sang some of the best songs of our time.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,520
But John Lennon was more 
than a singer and songwriter.

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:58,360
He talked about love and peace, and 
millions of young people listened to him.

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
He wanted to change the world.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,600
And when a man called Mark Chapman killed him,  

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:15,440
far from his Liverpool home, 
thousands of people stood and cried.

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,640
So how did John Lennon and his band become famous?

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,400
Why did people all around the world listen to him?

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:35,120
And why did one man want to 
kill him?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
CHAPTER TWO

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
Liverpool boy

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:51,400
John Winston Lennon was born in a 
Liverpool hospital on 9 October 1940.

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:03,120
Britain was at war, and John's father Alf worked 
on ships, so he was away most of the time.

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:14,000
His mother Julia wanted to leave Alf, and 
when John was five, they asked him a question:

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,440
did he want to live with his father or his mother?

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
John did not know.

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:33,560
He cried and went to his father at first, but 
when his mother walked away, he ran after her.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:41,240
He did not see Alf again for nineteen years.

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Life was not easy for Julia, 
so when John was seven,  

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:58,120
he began to live with his mother's sister 
- his aunt Mimi - in Woolton, Liverpool.

35
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:07,040
Mimi loved John, and her husband 
George always had time for him.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,760
George read books to John at night, 
and John learned to read with him.

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,720
They often walked around Woolton, too.

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,560
There was a big house called 
Strawberry Field near Mimi's house,  

39
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,520
and John liked to visit the gardens there.

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:42,480
Years later, Strawberry Fields Forever 
became one of his most famous songs.

41
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,400
John visited his mother Julia a lot.

42
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,680
She had two daughters now, 
but she loved John very much.

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:04,400
Julia had lots of photos of him in the house, 
and she often played a record called My Son John.

44
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Julia listened to the radio all the time, too,  

45
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:17,920
so John heard the new music 
from the USA - rock and roll.

46
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:27,400
Julia sang and played the banjo and, when John 
was about eight, he got his first harmonica.

47
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,640
He soon learned to play it very well.

48
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:40,640
Some of John's friends had pianos at home, 
so he learned to play the piano, too.

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,000
Then Julia taught him the banjo.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Music was easy for John, and at first, 
he was a good student at school, too.

51
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,640
But John could not see 
well, and he needed glasses.

52
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,680
Children laughed at his glasses, 
so he stopped wearing them.

53
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Because of this, and because he was 
not very interested in schoolwork,  

54
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,000
he did not do well at high school.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,560
But at home, John did a lot of writing and 
beautiful art, and he read lots and lots of books.

56
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,000
These were happy years for John.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,520
He liked to go to the cinema with his 
cousins Stanley Parkes and Liela Harvey.

58
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:53,360
When Stanley's family moved to Scotland, John 
and Liela often went there for the summer.

59
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:03,640
John played his harmonica for hours and hours 
on the long drive to Scotland from Liverpool!

60
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:11,840
One summer, when John was away in 
Scotland, Mimi's husband George died.

61
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,680
George was like a second father to John 
- but John never cried in front of Mimi.

62
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:28,000
In 1950s Liverpool, boys did not cry.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,840
At this time, John was becoming 
more and more interested in music.

64
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:46,920
In 1956, a young American rock and roll singer 
called Elvis Presley became very famous.

65
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,520
He was an amazing dancer, and 
his music was new and exciting.

66
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:02,440
Elvis had seven songs in the 
UK music charts that year.

67
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Suddenly, young people like John wanted to sing 
like Elvis, dress like him, and be in a band.

68
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,920
So Julia took John into town 
and bought him a guitar.

69
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:29,720
That summer, John began a skiffle 
band with two friends from school.

70
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:39,320
They were called The Quarrymen, because 
their school was called Quarry Bank.

71
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Skiffle was like American 
country music, but faster.

72
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,320
Soon, there were six boys in John's band.

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,440
They played songs by skiffle 
musicians like Lonnie Donegan.

74
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,600
That autumn, The Quarrymen began to do 
little concerts, like Saturday night dances.

75
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,480
John was the singer, and 
he played the guitar, too.

76
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,400
He always played very hard on his 
guitar strings, so he often broke them.

77
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,360
It was John's last year at school, 
and he needed to work hard.

78
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Mimi was not happy about the band, 
or about his pictures and writing.

79
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,440
Sometimes, she went into his room and took them.

80
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:53,520
'You're going to be sorry when I'm famous,' 
he often told her.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

81
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
CHAPTER THREE

82
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,320
The Beatles are born

83
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:11,040
On Saturday 6 July 1957, The Quarry men 
played two concerts in Woolton, Liverpool.

84
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,440
A fifteen-year-old boy called Paul 
McCartney was in the crowd that day.

85
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,120
He was a friend of one of The Quarrymen,  

86
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,000
and he met the band and talked to 
John before the second concert.

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,200
That day changed their lives.

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,800
When Paul met The Quarrymen 
between their concerts,  

89
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,720
he took one of their guitars and 
began playing a rock and roll song.

90
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,520
He was amazing!

91
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,280
John could play the first 
four strings of his guitar,  

92
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,240
like a four-string banjo, but 
Paul could play all six strings.

93
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,960
Paul soon became one of The Quarrymen,  

94
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,840
and John quickly learned to play 
all six strings on the guitar.

95
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:22,760
When John left school that summer, he nearly 
went and worked on ships like his father.

96
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:29,240
But with help from a teacher, he got 
into the Liverpool College of Art.

97
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:40,120
Seventeen-year-old John was good at art, 
but he did not listen to the teachers.

98
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,960
He often brought his guitar to college, 
and he dressed like a rock and roll singer.

99
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Sometimes, John did not go to college.

100
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,240
He met Paul in a cafe and they 
talked about books and music.

101
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,720
You could hear great music in the 
cafes of Liverpool at that time.

102
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,720
John and Paul listened to American rock 
and roll singers like Little Richard and  

103
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,920
Buddy Holly, and they learned to play their songs.

104
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:29,160
Paul liked to write music, and in 
1958, John began to write songs, too.

105
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,560
His first song was a love 
song called Hello Little Girl.

106
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Early in 1958, John met 
Paul's friend George Harrison.

107
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,440
George was three years younger than John,  

108
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,480
but he was amazing on the guitar 
- so he became a Quarryman, too.

109
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,040
The Quarrymen often met and 
played music in Julia's house.

110
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,200
She was always happy when they came, 
and she liked to listen to their music.

111
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,560
In July 1958, something changed John's life.

112
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,960
His mother died in a car accident.

113
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:29,120
John loved his mother very much, but 
he never cried in front of his friends.

114
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,800
It was a hard time for John, 
but students at his art college,  

115
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,600
like Cynthia Powell and Stuart 
Sutcliffe, helped him a lot.

116
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,880
Cynthia was John's girlfriend, and 
Stuart Sutcliffe was his best friend.

117
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,840
One day, Stuart bought a bass guitar.

118
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,040
He played that bass guitar for hours  

119
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:09,160
every day because he wanted to be in 
John's band, but he was not very good.

120
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,000
Stuart was an artist, not a musician.

121
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,800
Many different people played with The 
Quarrymen, but slowly the band became John,  

122
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:32,160
Paul, and George on guitars, and 
later, Stuart on the bass guitar.

123
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,360
Paul, George, and Stuart were not from Quarry 
Bank High School, so the band changed their name.

124
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:48,320
The Quarrymen became The 
Beatals, then The Silver Beetles.

125
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,640
They played in cafes and music 
clubs like the Casbah Coffee Club,  

126
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,400
but they did not get a lot 
of money for their concerts.

127
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:08,800
There were lots of young bands in Liverpool 
- and The Silver Beetles were not the best!

128
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,280
John and Stuart often went to a 
cafe called the Jacaranda Club.

129
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:24,840
The cafe manager, Allan Williams, 
knew a lot of bands, and in 1960,  

130
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:32,880
he found work for them in Scotland 
with a singer called Johnny Gentle.

131
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:41,960
The band were very excited about 
their first tour, but it was not easy.

132
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:50,760
They ate and stayed in some very bad 
places because they did not have any money.

133
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,080
In the end, Stuart's mother bought 
train tickets home for them.

134
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:05,920
Later, Williams found work for them 
in Hamburg, Germany - for more money.

135
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,480
For the first time, they had a drummer.

136
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,120
His name was Pete Best.

137
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,160
They had a new name, too:

138
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,840
The Beatles.

139
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:29,400
Williams drove them to Germany, and when they 
stopped in the Netherlands, John took a harmonica  

140
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,320
from a music shop and did not pay for it.

141
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,840
Many years later, John Lennon 
fans went to the Netherlands,  

142
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,200
found the shop, and paid for that harmonica.

143
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:55,920
From August to November 1960, The Beatles 
played at two different nightclubs in Hamburg.

144
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,840
They stayed in some very bad rooms,  

145
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,280
and they played for five, six, or 
seven hours every night of the week.

146
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,360
At one of the clubs, they 
performed with a Liverpool band,  

147
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,080
and they became friends with 
the drummer - Ringo Starr.

148
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:29,160
The bands finished work at 3 a.m., and 
then they all went out for breakfast!

149
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,120
The clubs were in the worst streets of Hamburg.

150
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:43,280
Every night, people threw bottles and chairs 
- and sometimes knives - across the room.

151
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:51,280
It was very, very hard for The 
Beatles, but they did not stop playing.

152
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,840
'One day we're going to be famous,' 
they thought.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

153
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,280
CHAPTER FOUR

154
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Beatlemania

155
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,280
In December 1960, The 
Beatles were back in England.

156
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,720
There were only four of them now, because 
Stuart Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg.

157
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,440
Nobody in Liverpool remembered the band.

158
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,800
But when they began to play at a concert 
there one night, everyone became very excited.

159
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,040
They moved nearer to the front, 
and some people began to scream!

160
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,800
The Beatles' music was 
different now, after Hamburg.

161
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:55,560
It was not skiffle or rock and roll - it was 
something new and exciting, and people loved it.

162
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,720
Everyone began to talk about The Beatles.

163
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,200
In April 1961, John, Paul, 
George, and Pete played most  

164
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:16,480
nights in clubs all around Liverpool 
- and the clubs sold every ticket!

165
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,000
That spring, The Beatles went 
back to Hamburg for four months,  

166
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,720
and they recorded songs there with 
a singer called Tony Sheridan.

167
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:38,560
Then, in November, they played in a 
Liverpool club called the Cavern Club.

168
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:46,280
It was not a big club, and it 
was hot, dark, smoky, and noisy.

169
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:54,040
But some of the best bands in Liverpool 
- and in Britain - played there.

170
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:02,280
A young man called Brian Epstein 
saw The Beatles at the Cavern Club.

171
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:10,640
Epstein did not often listen to bands, and 
he was not a band manager before he met John,  

172
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Paul, George, and Pete - he had a record shop.

173
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,880
But he knew a lot about music, 
and he loved The Beatles.

174
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,680
He came back and watched the band 
many times in the next few weeks.

175
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:38,040
The Beatles liked him, and 
he soon became their manager.

176
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Epstein quickly changed The 
Beatles' hair and clothes.

177
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:54,160
They wore suits now, so they looked different 
from most bands, and people remembered them.

178
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,600
Epstein looked for a record 
company for The Beatles, too.

179
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,760
Bands become famous because record 
companies make and sell their records,  

180
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,880
so this was important for The Beatles.

181
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,680
But for a long time, no record 
companies were interested.

182
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,720
Then, someone from Decca Records 
saw the band and liked them,  

183
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:33,600
so The Beatles performed for the 
record company on New Year's Day, 1962.

184
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:43,080
But they did not play well that day, and 
Decca did not want to make their records.

185
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:53,960
In August 1962, Ringo Starr became The Beatles' 
new drummer, and Pete Best left the band.

186
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,520
John married his girlfriend 
Cynthia Powell that month, too.

187
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,480
But he did not see his new wife very much:

188
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,920
The Beatles had concerts every night!

189
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,520
That summer, they began to play 
at the Cavern Club all the time.

190
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,920
Slowly, more people became 
interested in Liverpool music.

191
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,760
TV and magazine reporters from 
Europe and the USA visited  

192
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:38,200
the club, and they began to talk 
about Liverpool music, or 'Liverpop'.

193
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:46,640
After a lot of work, Brian Epstein now 
had a record company for The Beatles.

194
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,400
Parlophone (EMI) began to record their songs.

195
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,520
In October 1962, The Beatles' first record,  

196
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:06,560
the song Love Me Do, was number 
17 in the British music charts.

197
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,040
It was an exciting time for the band.

198
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,760
In February 1963, The Beatles 
had their first number one hit  

199
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,080
with a John Lennon song, Please Please Me.

200
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,680
Later, there was an album called Please Please Me,  

201
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:35,480
too, and The Beatles recorded 
all fourteen songs in one day!

202
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:45,960
John Lennon was ill that day, and the band 
played for ten hours, but he sang amazingly.

203
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,400
Three more of The Beatles' 
songs were number one in 1963.

204
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:01,040
The band became famous because of their 
records, and it happened very fast.

205
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,880
In October, they came to London and were on TV.

206
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:18,800
Fifteen million people watched them on TV, and 
thousands of fans waited outside the TV studio.

207
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,840
People screamed and stopped cars in the street.

208
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,360
One reporter called it 'Beatlemania'.

209
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,880
People cried and screamed 
at every Beatles concert.

210
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Fans waited outside their hotels, too - 
sometimes all night in the cold and rain.

211
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,480
In The Beatles' first film, 
A Hard Day's Night, John,  

212
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,400
Paul, George, and Ringo run away from their fans.

213
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,600
In Britain, that was their life.

214
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,720
People loved The Beatles 
because their songs were great,  

215
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,840
and you could easily remember and sing them.

216
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,560
The Beatles were young like their 
fans, and they looked good, too.

217
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,320
But The Beatles became famous 
because they worked very hard.

218
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,400
They played or recorded seven days a week,  

219
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,680
and John and Paul wrote new songs 
at night in their hotel rooms.

220
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,160
Between 1960 and 1964, The Beatles performed for  

221
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:58,480
about 1,200 hours - most bands do 
not play that much in their lives!

222
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,640
In November 1964, The Beatles 
did a big concert in Liverpool.

223
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Thousands of fans were in the streets, and 
more people stood in windows and on roofs.

224
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,960
'We want The Beatles!'

225
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,440
people cried, and the noise was amazing.

226
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:32,960
These four young men from Liverpool were now 
Britain's most famous faces.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

227
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
CHAPTER FIVE

228
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,200
World-famous

229
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,880
In the autumn of 1963, a famous American magazine  

230
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,520
laughed at British Beatles fans 
for their crying and screaming.

231
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,240
But soon, Beatlemania arrived in the USA.

232
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:09,520
In February 1964, The Beatles' song I Want to Hold 
Your Hand was number one in the American charts.

233
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,280
That month, when The Beatles went to the USA,  

234
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,400
five thousand fans waited for 
their plane at New York's John F.

235
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,880
Kennedy airport.

236
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,160
On 9 February, 73 million 
people watched The Beatles  

237
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,240
on the famous Ed Sullivan Show on American TV.

238
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:43,760
In the New York studio, people screamed 
when The Beatles began to play.

239
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,720
Outside, thousands of fans stood 
on Broadway and 53rd Street.

240
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,280
No one could get through the streets.

241
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,120
American stars like Elvis 
Presley were famous in Britain.

242
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,920
Now, suddenly, Americans loved a British band.

243
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:20,560
Later, British bands and singers like the Rolling 
Stones and Elton John became famous in the USA,  

244
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:31,560
too - but it all began with The 
Beatles, that night in New York City.

245
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:40,720
The Beatles played two concerts on their 
first visit to the USA - in Washington, D.C.

246
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,800
and New York City.

247
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,640
But they came back again in 
August 1964 for a one-month,  

248
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,080
thirty-concert tour of Canada and the USA.

249
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:08,040
On 23 August 1964, The Beatles performed 
at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

250
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:15,560
After the concert, they met some 
of Hollywood's rich and famous.

251
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:24,520
When John was a boy, he watched these film 
stars in the Woolton cinema with his cousins.

252
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,040
Now they wanted to meet him!

253
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:37,720
In the next two years, The Beatles 
went on tours to many countries,  

254
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,320
and there was Beatlemania around the world.

255
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,120
People nearly died in crowds in the Philippines.

256
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:58,480
In New Zealand, hundreds of fans stopped The 
Beatles' car, and they could not get out.

257
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:09,520
In Tokyo, the band could not leave their hotel 
because there were thousands of fans outside.

258
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:18,920
So John, Paul, George, and Ringo sat 
in their hotel room and made a picture.

259
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:27,960
Years later, somebody bought it for $155,000!

260
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:40,840
On their third American tour in 1965, The Beatles 
visited Elvis at his house in Los Angeles.

261
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,840
They sat and talked about music, then 
they began to play guitar with him.

262
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,360
It was amazing for John, 
because Elvis was his hero.

263
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:07,040
Friends watched while the two greatest names in 
music - The Beatles and Elvis - played together!

264
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:13,640
When The Beatles were not on tour, 
they recorded music in London.

265
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:26,040
Between 1963 and 1965, they made six albums, 
and lots of their songs, like Can't Buy Me Love,  

266
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:36,920
A Ticket to Ride, and We Can Work it Out, 
were number one in Britain and the USA.

267
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:44,320
Thousands of people bought the records, 
and fans could buy Beatles T-shirts,  

268
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,160
guitars, magazines, and lots more things, too.

269
00:31:51,160 --> 00:32:01,600
The Beatles became very rich, and John Lennon 
bought a big house and a very expensive car.

270
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,960
The money was great, but 
some things were not easy.

271
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:16,640
The Beatles could not go out for dinner or 
go to the shops because fans ran after them,  

272
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,400
and they quickly became tired of this.

273
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,400
And they were not happy with their 
concerts because people screamed,  

274
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,640
and nobody could hear their music.

275
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:42,200
Some of John and Paul's songs at this 
time, like Help, were not happy ones.

276
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Because people loved The Beatles,  

277
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,760
they watched them on TV and read 
about them in magazines all the time.

278
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,800
But sometimes The Beatles did not 
think carefully before they spoke.

279
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,360
In July 1966, John said something to a magazine  

280
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,440
reporter, and American fans became 
very angry when they read about it.

281
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,200
On The Beatles' fourth tour of the USA,  

282
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:26,240
people broke Beatles records in the 
street and protested outside the concerts.

283
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,040
Some people wrote angry letters, too.

284
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:38,880
'You're going to die,' some of them 
said, and Brian Epstein was afraid.

285
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:47,160
'Is somebody going to shoot John 
Lennon?' he thought.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

286
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,320
CHAPTER SIX

287
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,080
Family man

288
00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:01,200
In April 1964, a man walked into 
Brian Epstein's office and said,  

289
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:10,440
'I'm John Lennon's father.' When John 
saw Alf Lennon, he was not happy.

290
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,080
He thought, 'Do I want to meet my 
father again after nineteen years?

291
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,520
Why did he go away all those years ago?

292
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Why did he not visit or write?' 
John could not forget these things.

293
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:40,200
He met his father sometimes after that, 
but they never became good friends.

294
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
John's family life was not easy.

295
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,040
He and Cynthia had a son now, called Julian.

296
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:57,640
John wanted to be a good father to Julian, 
but he did not have much time with his family.

297
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:07,920
The Beatles were always on tour, or 
at the recording studios in London,  

298
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,880
so Cynthia and Julian often 
did not see John for weeks.

299
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,040
And when he was at home, he worked very hard.

300
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:27,640
He wrote songs all the time, 
and he wrote two books, too.

301
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:39,720
In the winter of 1966, John met a 
Japanese artist called Yoko Ono in London.

302
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,520
They soon became very good friends.

303
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,680
Yoko was seven years older than 
John, but she was very like him.

304
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,880
She was an artist and musician, too,  

305
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:07,200
and like John, Yoko had a young 
child - a daughter called Kyoko.

306
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:17,280
John and Cynthia soon broke up, and 
after that he was with Yoko all the time.

307
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:26,960
They made art together, and Yoko came to the 
studio when The Beatles recorded their music.

308
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:37,080
On 20 March 1969, Yoko and 
John got married in Gibraltar.

309
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:49,880
Yoko Ono became Yoko Ono Lennon, and John 
later changed his name to John Ono Lennon.

310
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:57,960
That summer, they bought a beautiful 
house called Tittenhurst Park.

311
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:07,000
Everything in the rooms was white, and they 
had a beautiful garden and a recording studio.

312
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,320
Yoko and John were happy there, and they 
recorded some amazing songs in the studio.

313
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,840
Julian often came to the house, 
and he played with Kyoko.

314
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,520
John and Yoko loved to do 
things with the children.

315
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,760
One year, they all went on holiday to Scotland,  

316
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:40,880
because John remembered happy summers 
there with his cousins.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

317
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,840
CHAPTER SEVEN

318
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Going solo

319
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:57,520
On 29 August 1966, The Beatles performed 
at Candlestick Park, San Francisco.

320
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,280
Twenty-five thousand fans listened to 
The Beatles that cold summer evening,  

321
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,880
but it was the band's last big concert.

322
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,480
The Beatles did not need to 
do concerts and tours now.

323
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,320
They could work in a studio, 
and sell millions of records.

324
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,440
They were afraid of the crowds at 
concerts, too - some fans got too excited.

325
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,880
A year after the San Francisco 
concert, Brian Epstein died.

326
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,000
He was only thirty-two years old.

327
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,520
Epstein was an amazing manager, 
and a great friend, too.

328
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,160
It was very hard for The Beatles because 
they were musicians, not managers.

329
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:03,320
They did not manage the band 
well after Epstein died.

330
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,800
They began a company called Apple, 
but the company lost a lot of money,  

331
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:18,480
and things were not easy between 
John, Paul, George, and Ringo.

332
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:27,360
On a cold winter's day in January 1969, The 
Beatles played together for the last time.

333
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,000
They performed for a film on a roof in London.

334
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,280
People stood in the street and listened.

335
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,440
Office workers looked out of windows.

336
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,720
Taxi drivers stopped their cars.

337
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,640
They could not see the people on the 
roof, but everybody knew their songs.

338
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:03,320
In the end, the police came onto the roof 
and stopped them, because of the noise!

339
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,760
A year later, the band began to break up.

340
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,440
Many of their fans could not understand it.

341
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:23,960
But The Beatles all wanted to do different things 
now, and they wanted to write different music.

342
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,840
In 1970, all four Beatles made solo albums.

343
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:38,200
After that, the four of them 
never played together again.

344
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:46,480
John Lennon made eight solo 
albums - most of them in the USA.

345
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,040
When John wrote songs for The 
Beatles, they were usually about love.

346
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:02,240
But the songs on his solo albums were often 
about the world around him, or about his life.

347
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,400
Some of them are very sad.

348
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:16,320
His second album, called Imagine, became one 
of the most important albums of all time.

349
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,240
1971 was an important year for John and Yoko:

350
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,840
they moved to the USA.

351
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:35,400
They found a house in Greenwich Village, in 
Manhattan, and they were very happy there.

352
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:43,640
New York in the 1970s was the 
most exciting city in the world.

353
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:52,600
John and Yoko's door was always open, 
and they met lots of interesting people.

354
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:00,760
They knew many of the best artists, 
writers, and musicians of their time.

355
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:12,560
John and Yoko went around the city on bicycles, 
and John loved his life there.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

356
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,520
CHAPTER EIGHT

357
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,160
War and peace

358
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:27,120
The day after John and Yoko got married 
in 1969, they went to Amsterdam.

359
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,640
It was an interesting week 
for a new husband and wife.

360
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:42,640
For seven days, they sat on their hotel 
bed and talked to reporters about peace.

361
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:52,440
They called their war protest a 'bed-in', 
and it was on TV around the world.

362
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:03,840
At the time, there were wars in many countries, 
like Northern Ireland, Nigeria, and Mozambique.

363
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,640
One of the worst wars was in Vietnam:

364
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:17,960
half a million Americans went and fought 
there, and every day, hundreds of people died.

365
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,440
Many people wanted to stop the war.

366
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:33,040
The second bed-in protest was 
in Montreal, Canada in May 1969.

367
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,840
One day, John recorded a song 
called Give Peace a Chance.

368
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:49,440
There were many people in their room that 
day - reporters, musicians, and friends.

369
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,120
John played the guitar and sang, 
and everyone became the band.

370
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:02,720
They hit the tables with 
their hands and sang with him.

371
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,960
It became the most famous song 
of the Vietnam War protest.

372
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:17,560
On 15 November that year, hundreds of 
thousands of people sang Give Peace a  

373
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:24,760
Chance outside the White House in Washington, D.C.

374
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:33,560
Later that year, John recorded a song 
called Happy Christmas (War is Over),  

375
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:41,040
and John and Yoko paid for posters 
in ten cities around the world.

376
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:50,720
The posters said 'WAR IS OVER (if you 
want it)' in many different languages.

377
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,040
This was John and Yoko's message to the world.

378
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:05,360
After John and Yoko moved to the 
USA, John talked about peace on TV,  

379
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:12,440
and he went to many protests about 
wars and spoke to the crowds.

380
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:21,080
Millions of young Americans listened to 
him, and the government was not happy.

381
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:31,000
The FBI (government police) began to watch 
John, and they listened to his telephone.

382
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,680
In 1972, the government wrote him a letter.

383
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,760
You must leave the country, the letter said.

384
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:52,960
Yoko and John wanted to stay in the USA, so 
they talked to a lawyer called Leon Wildes.

385
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,360
Wildes was not very interested 
in John's war protests  

386
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,280
or his music, but he worked 
very hard for John and Yoko.

387
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:13,240
It took four years, but in the end, John 
Lennon could live freely in the USA.

388
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,520
John liked the work of Gandhi 
and Martin Luther King.

389
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,520
These men changed the world, but they did not do  

390
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:33,520
it with guns - they changed it 
with love, protests, and peace.

391
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,760
Before John Lennon, rock stars and film 
stars did not usually talk about peace,  

392
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,680
or changing the world.

393
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:52,640
Today, people like Bono, Angelina Jolie, 
and George Clooney work hard for peace,  

394
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,840
and they help thousands of people 
around the world.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

395
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,160
CHAPTER NINE

396
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,480
A quiet life

397
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:13,600
9 October 1975 was a very 
important day for John and Yoko.

398
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:22,640
Their son Sean Taro Lennon was born 
- on John's thirty-fifth birthday.

399
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:31,520
When John's first son Julian was born, he did not 
see him very much because he was in The Beatles.

400
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,840
This time, he wanted to be a better 
father, so he stopped making music.

401
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,040
John became a 'house husband'.

402
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:51,440
Yoko worked, and John stayed 
at home all day with Sean.

403
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,760
They often went out for lunch or dinner, or 
shopping, and they played with their cats.

404
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,640
John did everything for Sean, 
and he sang to him at night.

405
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,080
Julian sometimes visited them in the USA, too.

406
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:16,920
Mimi never came to New York, 
but John often asked her.

407
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,160
She was afraid of the USA 
because many Americans had guns.

408
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,880
John and Yoko now lived in a famous 
New York building called The Dakota.

409
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,600
From their windows, you could see the 
trees and gardens of Central Park.

410
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,960
John and Yoko took Sean to 
Central Park all the time.

411
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,640
New Yorkers often saw them when they walked there.

412
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,320
'Hey, John.

413
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,360
How are you?' people called.

414
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,760
But fans did not run after him.

415
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,400
John loved that.

416
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,600
John did not make any albums for five years,  

417
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:15,040
but he bought records and listened to the 
latest music - from glam rock to punk.

418
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:25,360
He worked on his third book, too, and wrote 
lots of letters - to friends, family, and fans.

419
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,280
He did some art, and he made nice dinners at home.

420
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:41,040
And he learned some Japanese, because 
John, Yoko, and Sean went to Japan in 1977.

421
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:50,720
They stayed there all summer, and John and 
Sean met Yoko's family for the first time.

422
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,960
The Lennon's usually lived 
in their home in The Dakota,  

423
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,760
but they had a beautiful house 
near the sea on Long Island, too.

424
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,640
John learned to sail there, and he loved it.

425
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:17,200
In June 1980, John sailed from Rhode 
Island to Bermuda with some friends.

426
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,000
At first, everything went well.

427
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,800
But then some very bad Atlantic weather hit them.

428
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Some of John's friends became ill, so 
for hours, John did all the sailing.

429
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:44,080
He was afraid, but he stood out 
there in the rain and sang songs.

430
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:51,720
Sean and Yoko met John and his friends 
when they arrived in Hamilton, Bermuda,  

431
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,840
and John stayed there with Sean for two months.

432
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:09,200
He began to work on a new album, and he wrote 
some great songs, like Woman and Beautiful Boy.

433
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,480
Then, one day, he saw a beautiful 
flower in the gardens in Hamilton.

434
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:22,920
It was called 'Double Fantasy', 
and John loved the name.

435
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:32,920
When he went back to New York, John wanted 
to record an album called Double Fantasy.

436
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:41,000
John was excited about music again, 
and he began to record new songs.

437
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,920
One day that autumn, John and Yoko 
were in the recording studio all night.

438
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,800
In the morning, they heard 
John's first new record,  

439
00:51:53,800 --> 00:52:00,160
the song (Just Like) Starting Over, on the radio.

440
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:08,320
They were very happy, and they danced 
around the room!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

441
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,440
CHAPTER TEN

442
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Dead heroes

443
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:23,360
On 9 October 1980, Sean and John had 
their fifth and fortieth birthdays.

444
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:32,840
Fans waited outside The Dakota, and at 5 p.m., 
they looked up and saw planes in the sky.

445
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,360
The planes wrote a message:

446
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:43,320
'Happy Birthday John and Sean - love Yoko.'

447
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,360
Eight thousand kilometres away in Hawaii, 
it was eleven o'clock in the morning,  

448
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,440
and a man called Mark David Chapman 
could hear something in his head:

449
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,360
'Kill someone famous!'

450
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,360
Two weeks after John's birthday,  

451
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:15,640
Chapman bought a gun, got a plane to 
New York City and visited The Dakota.

452
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,680
But he could not buy bullets for his 
gun in New York City, so he left.

453
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:34,480
On 5 December, John talked to a reporter from a 
music magazine about the film star James Dean.

454
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:42,880
James Dean died very young, and 
he became a hero for young people.

455
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,520
'I don't want to be a dead hero,' John said.

456
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,760
The next day, Mark Chapman 
came back to New York City.

457
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,240
This time, he had bullets.

458
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:09,920
On Monday 8 December 1980, John and 
Yoko left The Dakota at around 5 p.m.

459
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,680
Chapman came up to them.

460
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:20,200
He had John's new Double Fantasy 
album, and John wrote on it for him.

461
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:28,840
John and Yoko worked in the recording 
studio that evening, and John phoned Mimi.

462
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:36,480
At about 10.45 p.m., John and Yoko came back home.

463
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,200
Their driver often drove the car into 
The Dakota, but it was a nice evening,  

464
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:49,560
so this time he stopped outside in the street.

465
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,240
John and Yoko got out of the ear.

466
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,840
Chapman was in the street 
near the door of The Dakota.

467
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:06,320
He took out his gun and 
shot John Lennon four times.

468
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:12,760
Then he sat and waited for the police.

469
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:20,160
An ambulance arrived very quickly, 
and took John to Roosevelt Hospital,  

470
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,800
but he was dead when he arrived there.

471
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,600
Soon, TV across the USA and the world told people:

472
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,120
'John Lennon is dead.'

473
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,240
Crowds of people came to The Dakota.

474
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,400
'He's not dead!

475
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,560
It's not true!'

476
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,280
one girl cried.

477
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,160
But it was.

478
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,240
The next Sunday in Liverpool, thousands 
of people stood in the streets.

479
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:05,000
They remembered their city's dead 
hero, and they listened to his songs.

480
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:16,840
Across the Atlantic in New York City's Central 
Park, a crowd of 150,000 people stood in the cold.

481
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,800
Some quietly cried.

482
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,280
Some sang John Lennon's songs.

483
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,920
They had photos of John and big messages.

484
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,120
'Why?' read one message.

485
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,760
'We'll never forget you,' read another.

486
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,000
And they did not.

487
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,320
New York City was John's second 
home, and now there is a place  

488
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:56,440
in Central Park called Strawberry 
Fields, like John's famous song.

489
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,600
It is a quiet place, and 
people sit there and think.

490
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:12,560
There is a memorial at Strawberry Fields, 
too - a circle with the word 'Imagine' in it.

491
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:20,960
People leave flowers on the circle, and 
sometimes people leave their guitars.

492
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,080
Every year on 8 December, 
people meet in Central Park.

493
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:34,360
They remember John's life, 
and they sing his songs.

494
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:44,760
Thousands came in 2010, thirty years 
after he died.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

495
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,960
CHAPTER ELEVEN

496
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,800
Remembering John Lennon

497
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:59,800
There are many John Lennon statues and 
John Lennon memorials around the world.

498
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:07,480
One of the best statues is near 
the old Cavern Club in Liverpool.

499
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,480
It is John when he was a young Beatle.

500
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:24,320
He is standing next to a building with his hands 
in his pockets - a young man with a big dream.

501
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,120
The year after John died,  

502
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:38,440
George Harrison wrote a song about his old 
friend, and George, Paul, and Ringo recorded it.

503
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:46,960
Later, Paul McCartney remembered 
John in his song Here Today.

504
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:56,040
There were songs by bands and singers like 
the Cranberries, Queen, and Elton John, too.

505
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:06,240
Paul, George, and Ringo all became solo 
musicians after The Beatles broke up,  

506
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,360
and they all performed at 
concerts around the world.

507
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:20,920
Paul McCartney became one of the 
greatest British singers of his time.

508
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:32,560
George Harrison died in 2001, but Paul 
and Ringo never stopped performing.

509
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:39,080
Julian and Sean Lennon became 
musicians like their father.

510
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,840
They want to make the world a better place,  

511
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:51,720
and they do a lot of important work 
and help many different people.

512
00:59:51,720 --> 01:00:02,920
Yoko Ono finished John Lennon's last album 
after he died, and his last book, too.

513
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:10,760
She became an important artist, 
musician, and peace worker.

514
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,040
She never left The Dakota:

515
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:23,960
she stayed there because she wanted to 
remember all the good times there with him.

516
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:31,840
After John died, many fans wanted to 
buy some of his things, like letters,  

517
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,080
or albums with his writing on them.

518
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:45,720
In 1982, someone bought his car for $2.23 million!

519
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:52,320
But most people want to 
remember the man and his music.

520
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,440
There are lots of books, magazines,  

521
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:06,560
and films about John Lennon, and two hundred 
thousand people buy his albums every year.

522
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:14,760
When many people think about John 
Lennon, they remember his song Imagine.

523
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:20,800
It became one of the most 
important songs of all time,  

524
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,920
but it was John Lennon's 
message to the world, too.

525
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:37,160
Imagine is a song about living together - 
in a world without hungry people and war.

526
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:45,560
In the video for Imagine, John is 
sitting at a white piano in a white room,  

527
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,360
but the shutters on the windows are closed.

528
01:01:50,360 --> 01:02:01,160
Then Yoko opens the shutters, the summer 
sun comes into the room, and John sings.

529
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:07,720
He sings of his dream, and it is a beautiful one:

530
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:18,040
a dream of a better world for everyone.
