CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,150
The Journey Begins

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:12,800
The wonderful views of snow-topped mountains
passed unnoticed as the train sped away from

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,009
Syria towards Istanbul.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:22,849
As the Belgian detective M. Hercule Poirot
drank his coffee, he watched the only other

6
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:29,779
person in the restaurant carriage - a tall,
thin young lady, perhaps twenty-eight years

7
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,779
old.

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,430
From the way that she ate her breakfast, she
seemed to be an experienced and confident

9
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,430
traveller.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,040
He admired her pale face, tidy dark hair and
cool grey eyes.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,710
A good-looking woman, he thought, but perhaps
a little too cold and efficient to be described

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,710
as pretty.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,650
Soon a tall, thin man entered the restaurant
carriage.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:06,860
He was between forty and fifty, with greying
hair and skin darkened by the sun.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,759
He spoke to the woman.

16
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,840
His accent was English.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,580
'Morning, Miss Debenham.'

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,869
'Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot,' she replied.

19
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,520
'Do you mind if I sit with you?'

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,270
'Of course not.

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,439
Please, sit.'

22
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,090
She smiled politely.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,000
He sat down and ordered his breakfast.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,979
He looked quickly towards M. Poirot - at his
enormous, curled moustache and strange, egg-shaped

25
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,369
head - then looked away.

26
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:49,649
'Just a silly looking foreigner,' he thought
to himself.

27
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,909
The British pair exchanged a few polite words
over their breakfast, and at lunchtime they

28
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,280
sat together again.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,789
The man spoke of his life in the army in India,
and occasionally asked the girl questions

30
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,920
about Baghdad, where she had been a governess.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:17,920
When they discovered that they had some friends
in common, they became more friendly.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,470
'Are you stopping in Istanbul?'

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,470
the man asked.

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,470
'No, I'm going straight through.

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,610
I saw all the sights two years ago, on my
way to Baghdad.'

36
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,920
'Well, I must say I'm very glad about that.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm going straight through too.'

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,450
His face went a little red.

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,410
'That will be nice,' said Miss Debenham without
emotion.

40
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,750
The train stopped late that evening at Konya.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,190
The two English travellers went outside for
some fresh air and exercise.

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,320
After a few minutes, Poirot decided to get
some air too, and started to walk along the

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,350
platform.

44
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,920
It was bitterly cold.

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,470
Out of the darkness, he heard two voices.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,550
Arbuthnot was speaking.

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,610
'Mary -'

48
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,900
A girl interrupted him.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,730
'Not now.

50
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,430
Not now.

51
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,790
When it's all over.

52
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,880
When it's behind us - then -

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,400
M. Poirot silently changed direction.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,530
'Strange,' he said to himself.

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,090
It was the voice of Miss Debenham, but a very
different one from the cool, efficient voice

56
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,380
that he had heard on the train.

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,040
The next afternoon, the train stopped unexpectedly.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,080
Poirot asked the conductor if there was a
problem.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,090
Miss Debenham was just behind him.

60
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,760
'What's the matter?'

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,790
she asked Poirot in French.

62
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,390
'Why are we stopping?'

63
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,600
'Something caught fire under the restaurant
carriage,' he explained, 'but they are repairing

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
the damage.

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,540
It is nothing serious.'

66
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,980
She looked impatient.

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,410
'But the time!

68
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,709
This will delay us.'

69
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,650
'It is possible - yes,' agreed Poirot.

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,370
'But we can't afford delay!

71
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:35,120
If we are delayed by more than an hour, we
will miss our connection with the Orient Express.'

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,439
Her hands were shaking.

73
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,360
She was clearly very upset.

74
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,849
Luckily, her worries were soon forgotten.

75
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:51,110
Ten minutes later the train was again on its
way, and the rest of the journey to Istanbul

76
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,389
went very smoothly.

77
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,930
M. Poirot went straight to the Tokatlian Hotel.

78
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,979
He was looking forward to a few days visiting
the sights in Istanbul before he continued

79
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,909
his journey home.

80
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,060
At the hotel, he asked if he had any letters.

81
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,620
There were three, and an urgent message too.

82
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,219
This was a surprise.

83
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,620
'Unexpected change in Kassner case.

84
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,900
Please return immediately,' he read.

85
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,199
'How annoying!' he said to himself.

86
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,509
He looked at the clock.

87
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:42,580
'I must leave Istanbul tonight,' he told the
man at the hotel desk.

88
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,509
'Can you get me a first-class compartment
to London?'

89
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,189
'Of course, Monsieur.

90
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,680
The train is almost empty in the winter.

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,449
It leaves at nine o'clock.'

92
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,370
'Thank you,' said M. Poirot.

93
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,620
He had just enough time for some dinner.

94
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,990
As he was ordering his food in the hotel restaurant,
he felt a hand on his shoulder.

95
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,110
'M. Poirot!

96
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,879
What an unexpected pleasure!' said a voice
behind him.

97
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,409
The speaker was a short, fat man in his fifties.

98
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:25,050
'M. Bouc!'

99
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,620
cried Poirot.

100
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,719
M. Bouc was Belgian, and had a high position
in the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons

101
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:34,719
Lits.

102
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:42,150
The two men had been friends for many years,
since the days when Poirot was a young detective

103
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,229
in the Belgian police force.

104
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:51,740
'You are very far from home, my friend,' said
M. Bouc.

105
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
'Yes.

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,839
A little business in Syria.

107
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,889
But I am heading home tonight - on the Orient
Express, if there is a compartment.'

108
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:01,889
'Excellent!

109
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,960
I will be on the same train.

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,219
Later, you can tell me all your news.

111
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,949
You are a famous detective now, I hear.'

112
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,409
With a warm smile, M. Bouc left the restaurant.

113
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:28,529
M. Poirot returned to the job of keeping his
moustache out of the soup.

114
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:34,379
Soon, though, his attention was caught by
two men who were sitting together at a table

115
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,339
not far from his.

116
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:42,050
The younger was a friendly-looking man of
thirty, clearly an American.

117
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,699
The other was in his sixties and seemed at
first to be a kind old gentleman.

118
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:57,289
But when his small, shadowy eyes met Poirot's,
the detective's opinion of him changed completely.

119
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:03,219
Just for a second Poirot sensed that the man
was dangerous.

120
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:10,150
It seemed that there was a wild animal hidden
inside the man's body, looking out at the

121
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,599
world with those evil eyes.

122
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,970
M. Poirot soon joined his friend M. Bouc near
the hotel desk.

123
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,449
Their conversation was interrupted by the
hotel worker who was organising M. Poirot's

124
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,509
train ticket.

125
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,080
'It is very strange, Monsieur.

126
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,039
All the first-class compartments are booked
- and the second-class too.'

127
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,120
'What?' asked M. Bouc.

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,969
'At this time of year?

129
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:44,969
Impossible!'

130
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,839
'But it is true, sir,' the man replied.

131
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,490
'I am sorry.'

132
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,199
'Well, well,' M. Bouc said to Poirot, 'do
not worry.

133
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:01,810
We will arrange something with the conductor.'

134
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,800
He looked up at the clock.

135
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,120
'Come,' he said, 'it is time to go.'

136
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,060
At the station, M. Bouc took the conductor
to one side.

137
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,279
'We must find a compartment for this gentleman
here.

138
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,760
He is a friend of mine.'

139
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,279
'But we are completely full, Monsieur.

140
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,820
It is most unusual.'

141
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:38,250
'Well,' said M. Bouc, 'tomorrow there will
be more compartments, when we reach Belgrade.

142
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,339
The problem is for tonight.'

143
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,130
He paused for a moment.

144
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,259
'Everyone has arrived?'

145
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,860
The conductor looked at his list.

146
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,810
'Number 7 - a second-class compartment.

147
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:18,180
The gentleman - a Mr Harris - has not yet
come, and it is four minutes to nine.'

148
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,500
'Then put M. Poirot's luggage in number 7,'
said M. Bouc.

149
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
'If this Mr Harris arrives, we will tell him
that he is too late.'

150
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,050
With words of thanks to M. Bouc, Poirot followed
his luggage to compartment 7.

151
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,490
Inside it was the tall young American from
the hotel.

152
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,310
He was not pleased when Poirot entered.

153
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,850
'Excuse me,' he said in French.

154
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,029
'I think you've made a mistake.'

155
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:52,089
'There are no other beds on the train, M.
MacQueen,' the conductor apologised.

156
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,240
'The gentleman has to come in here.'

157
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,529
Poirot noticed that the conductor seemed almost
as annoyed as the American.

158
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:02,890
Perhaps he had been offered money to keep
the other bed empty.

159
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:09,250
When the conductor had left, MacQueen's annoyance
seemed forgotten.

160
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,139
'The train's surprisingly full,' he said with
a smile.

161
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:18,800
Just then, the train started moving.

162
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,839
Their three-day journey across Europe had
begun.

163
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:33,050
After a good night's sleep, Poirot spent the
morning alone in his compartment, looking

164
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,540
at his notes on the case that had called him
to London.

165
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,959
He had a late lunch with M. Bouc.

166
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,620
As they relaxed at the end of the meal, they
looked around the restaurant carriage.

167
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,850
'If I were a writer, I would use this scene,'
said M. Bouc.

168
00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:02,339
'All around us are people of all classes,
of all nationalities, of all ages.

169
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,139
For three days these people sleep and eat
under one roof.

170
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,940
They cannot escape each other.

171
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:22,480
But at the end of the three days they go their
separate ways and never see each other again.'

172
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,790
There were thirteen people in the restaurant
carriage, and M. Bouc was right: they were

173
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,709
a very mixed group.

174
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:39,860
A big, hairy Italian was sitting with a thin,
pale Englishman, probably a servant, and an

175
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,410
American in a brightly-coloured suit.

176
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:49,670
The American and Italian exchanged business
advice while the Englishman stared out of

177
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,750
the window.

178
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,769
He was clearly not enjoying the conversation.

179
00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:02,920
At the next table sat an ugly lady whose clothes
and jewellery, though they did nothing to

180
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,129
help her appearance, were clearly from the
most expensive shops in Paris.

181
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,600
'That is Princess Dragomiroff,' said M. Bouc.

182
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:22,860
'She is Russian, but her husband got his money
out of the country before the Communists took

183
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
control.

184
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,800
So ugly, but what a character!'

185
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,180
At another table, Mary Debenham was sitting
with a kind looking middle-aged woman with

186
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:44,110
fair hair and a sheep-like face; with them
was an older woman, an American who never

187
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,600
seemed to stop talking.

188
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,660
Colonel Arbuthnot was at the next table, alone.

189
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,490
Against the wall sat a middle-aged woman dressed
in black - a servant, Poirot guessed.

190
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:04,649
Then there was a good-looking man of about
thirty with a beautiful young woman.

191
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:12,420
Perfectly dressed in the latest fashion, she
had pale skin and large brown eyes.

192
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,360
Poirot could not take his eyes off her.

193
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:24,980
'A Hungarian diplomat and his wife, I believe,'
said M. Bouc, seeing his friend's interest.

194
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,639
'A very attractive couple.'

195
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:35,259
Then there was MacQueen and his employer,
the man with the kind face and the small,

196
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,320
cruel eyes.

197
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,959
M. Bouc returned to his compartment while
M. Poirot finished his coffee.

198
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:51,029
'My daughter said I would have no trouble
with these food tickets,' he heard the American

199
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,399
woman say to Miss Debenham as she paid the
waiter.

200
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,910
'But then there's money for the waiter, and
that bottle of water.

201
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,389
Nasty water too.

202
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:09,930
They haven't got any Evian, which seems very
odd to me.'

203
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,710
She looked crossly at the coins in front of
her.

204
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:18,610
'And look at this rubbish that the waiter's
given me.

205
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,380
Dinars or something.

206
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,150
My daughter said -'

207
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:28,029
At this point, Mary Debenham made a polite
excuse and left the table.

208
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,600
Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her.

209
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:41,460
Very soon the restaurant carriage was empty
except for Poirot and MacQueen's employer.

210
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,319
To the detective's surprise, the man came
and sat down at his table.

211
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:52,040
'Good afternoon,' he said in a quiet, deep
voice.

212
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,860
'My name is Ratchett.

213
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,180
I think that I have the pleasure of speaking
to Mr Hercule Poirot.

214
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,240
Is that right?'

215
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,959
'Your information is correct, Monsieur,' said
the detective.

216
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,749
'I want you to do a job for me,' said Ratchett.

217
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,290
Poirot looked surprised.

218
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,720
'I take very few cases, I'm afraid.'

219
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,220
'Of course.

220
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,959
But this, Mr Poirot, means money.

221
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,459
Big money.'

222
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,279
Poirot was silent for a moment.

223
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:41,269
Then he said, 'What do you wish me to do for
you, M. - er - Ratchett?'

224
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,600
'Mr Poirot, I am a rich man - a very rich
man.

225
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,120
Men in my position have enemies.

226
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,740
Someone has threatened to kill me.

227
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,509
I can look after myself quite well.'

228
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:03,579
He quickly showed Poirot the gun in his pocket.

229
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:08,459
'But I'd like to be especially careful.

230
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,679
Remember, we are talking big money, Mr Poirot.'

231
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,910
Poirot thought for some minutes.

232
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:24,930
Finally he said, 'I am sorry, Monsieur, but
I cannot help you.'

233
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,150
The other man smiled.

234
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,790
'Not even if I give you twenty thousand dollars?'

235
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,850
'No, Monsieur.'

236
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,430
'But why not?

237
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,400
Why does this case not interest you?'

238
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,650
Poirot stood up.

239
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:53,830
'Forgive me for being personal, but I do not
like your face, M. Ratchett,' he said.

240
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:01,630
The Orient Express arrived at Belgrade at
a quarter to nine that evening.

241
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,250
M. Bouc was moved into a carriage that had
just joined the train from Athens, and Poirot

242
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,070
was given M. Bouc's old compartment, number
1.

243
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:19,890
At 9.15, with heavy snow falling outside,
the train was on its way again.

244
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,200
The strangers of yesterday were already becoming
more friendly.

245
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,679
Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door
of his compartment talking to MacQueen.

246
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:39,470
Two doors from Poirot's new compartment, the
older American woman, Mrs Hubbard, was talking

247
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,890
to the sheep-like lady.

248
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,130
'Oh, isn't this cold weather terrible!

249
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,200
I hope your head will be better in the morning.

250
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,529
Have you got some aspirin?

251
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:55,529
Are you sure?

252
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,529
I've got plenty.

253
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,090
Well, good night, my dear.'

254
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,700
She turned to Poirot as the other woman departed.

255
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,220
'Poor woman, she's Swedish.

256
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,240
Some kind of teacher.

257
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,990
Very nice, but doesn't talk much English.

258
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,870
She was very interested to hear about my daughter.'

259
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:22,770
Poirot, like everyone else on the train, now
knew all about Mrs Hubbard's daughter, who

260
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,320
was teaching at a big American college in
Turkey.

261
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,480
They also knew Mrs Hubbard's opinion of Turks,
their lazy habits and the terrible condition

262
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
of their roads.

263
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,080
The door next to them opened and the thin,
pale manservant came out.

264
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,140
Inside, Poirot saw Mr Ratchett sitting up
in bed.

265
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,550
Then the door was shut.

266
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,430
Mrs Hubbard moved closer to Poirot.

267
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,970
'You know, I'm frightened of that man,' she
said quietly.

268
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,399
'Not the servant - the other man.

269
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:05,210
I can just feel that he's dangerous.

270
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,341
He's next door to me and I don't like it.

271
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:13,450
It wouldn't surprise me if he was a murderer.'

272
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,890
Colonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming
towards them down the corridor.

273
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:26,150
'Come into my compartment,' MacQueen was saying,
'and we can talk some more.

274
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,950
So you think that in India the British should
-'

275
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,370
The voice suddenly went quiet as the two men
entered MacQueen's compartment.

276
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,059
'I'm going to bed,' Mrs Hubbard said to Poirot.

277
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,590
'Good night.'

278
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:49,279
Poirot went into his own compartment, which
was the next one beyond Ratchett's.

279
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,950
He read in bed for about hall an hour and
then turned out the light.

280
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,370
He was woken a few hours later by a cry.

281
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,559
It sounded like a cry of pain, from somewhere
not far away.

282
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,100
This was immediately followed by the ringing
of a bell.

283
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Poirot sat up and switched on the light.

284
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,220
He noticed that the train was not moving.

285
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,490
Remembering that Ratchett was in the next-door
compartment, he got out of bed and opened

286
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,610
the door.

287
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,520
The conductor was hurrying along the corridor.

288
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,101
He knocked on

289
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:32,130
Ratchett's door.

290
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,130
No answer.

291
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:40,220
He knocked a second time, just as another
bell rang further down the corridor and a

292
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,490
light was turned on.

293
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,120
From Ratchett's compartment, a voice called
out, 'Ce n'est rien.

294
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,790
Je me suis trompe.'

295
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,690
'Very good, Monsieur,' said the conductor.

296
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,510
He hurried off again, towards the door where
the light was showing.

297
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,990
Poirot returned to bed, checked his watch
and switched off the light.

298
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,980
It was twenty-three minutes to one.

299
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,110
He could not sleep.

300
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,950
The noises on board the train seemed unusually
loud.

301
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:23,200
He could hear Ratchett moving around next
door, and footsteps in the corridor outside.

302
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,740
His throat felt dry.

303
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,080
He had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle
of water.

304
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,240
He looked at his watch again.

305
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,919
A quarter past one.

306
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,370
He was thinking of ringing for the conductor
and asking him for water when he heard another

307
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,370
bell ring.

308
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,950
Ting... ting... ting...

309
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,390
Poirot waited: The conductor could not come
to two compartments at the same time.

310
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,200
The bell sounded again and again.

311
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,549
Someone was clearly getting impatient.

312
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,760
Finally the conductor came.

313
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,620
Poirot heard him apologise.

314
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,990
Then there was a woman's voice - Mrs Hubbard's.

315
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,520
She spoke for some time, with the conductor
adding a few words here and there.

316
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,820
Then the conductor said goodnight and the
door was closed.

317
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,919
Poirot took his chance and rang his own bell.

318
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,039
The conductor, when he came, looked upset.

319
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:33,330
'It is Mrs Hubbard,' he explained.

320
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:42,429
'She says that there is a man in her room.

321
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,559
Imagine it - in a room of that size!

322
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,559
Where could he hide?

323
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,730
I told her that it was impossible, but she
didn't listen.

324
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,951
We have enough to worry about already, with
this snow -'

325
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:53,951
'Snow?'

326
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:54,951
'Yes, Monsieur.

327
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,580
There is too much snow on the line.

328
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,630
The train has stopped.

329
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,730
We might have to wait here for days.'

330
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,340
He brought Poirot the water, then said goodnight.

331
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,390
Poirot drank a glass of water and began to
fall asleep.

332
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,350
He was soon wide awake again, though.

333
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,880
There had been a loud noise from the next-door
compartment.

334
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,450
Had something heavy fallen against the door?

335
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,039
He jumped out of bed and looked out.

336
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:35,530
Nothing, except a woman in a red dressing
gown some distance down the corridor.

337
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:40,120
At the other end of the corridor, the conductor
was doing some paperwork.

338
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,740
Everything was quiet.

339
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:49,830
'I should stop worrying,' he said to himself,
and went back to bed.

340
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,929
This time he slept until morning.

341
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,330
CHAPTER TWO

342
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,630
A Cruel and Dangerous Man

343
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:09,210
When Poirot woke, the train was still not
moving.

344
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,299
There was deep snow all around them.

345
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,570
In the restaurant carriage, everyone was complaining
about the delay.

346
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,080
'How long will we be here?'

347
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,340
Mary Debenham asked.

348
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,600
'Doesn't anybody know?'

349
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,919
Her voice sounded impatient, but she was not
upset in the way that she had been at the

350
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,640
delay before reaching Istanbul.

351
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,700
Mrs Hubbard replied, 'Nobody knows anything
on this train, and nobody's trying to do anything.

352
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,840
If this was in America, people would at least
try to do something!

353
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,060
My daughter says -' The morning continued
in this way.

354
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:02,500
Poirot learnt a lot more about Mrs Hubbard's
daughter and about the habits of Mr Hubbard,

355
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,140
who had recently died.

356
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:12,750
Turning round, Poirot noticed a conductor
at his elbow - not the conductor from the

357
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,240
night before, but a big, fair man.

358
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,730
'Excuse me, Monsieur,' he said.

359
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,510
'M. Bouc would be grateful it you could come
to him for a few minutes.'

360
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:30,110
Poirot made his excuses to the ladies and
followed the conductor to a compartment in

361
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,789
the next carriage.

362
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:38,380
M. Bouc was sitting there with a small, dark
man, and a man in a blue uniform - the train

363
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
manager.

364
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,240
The conductor from the night before was standing
by the window.

365
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,320
'My good friend,' cried M. Bouc, 'we need
your help!'

366
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,649
M. Bouc was clearly upset.

367
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:59,230
Poirot realised at once that the matter was
serious.

368
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,630
'What has happened?' he asked.

369
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,779
'Well, first this terrible snow - this delay.

370
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,419
And now -'

371
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,640
He stopped.

372
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,470
'And now what?'

373
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:29,429
'And now a passenger lies murdered in his
bed.'

374
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:30,799
'Which passenger?' asked M. Poirot.

375
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,799
'An American.

376
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:35,210
A mad called - called -' M. Bouc looked at
his notes.

377
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,210
'Ratchett.

378
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,210
It is a disaster!

379
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,210
A murder is bad enough.

380
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,149
But the train cannot move.

381
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:46,310
We may be here for days.

382
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:57,870
We have no police on board, and Dr Constantine
thinks that the murderer is still among us.'

383
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,799
The small, dark man now spoke.

384
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:08,430
'The window of M. Ratchett's compartment was
found wide open, but there were no footprints

385
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,279
in the snow.

386
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,529
No one left the train that way.'

387
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,289
'At what time was the murder?' asked the detective.

388
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:27,070
'It is difficult to give an exact time,' replied
the doctor, 'but it was some time between

389
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,309
midnight and 2 a.m.'

390
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,110
'And the crime was discovered - when?'

391
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:42,730
M. Bouc turned to Michel, the conductor by
the window, who looked pale and frightened.

392
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:51,170
'The waiter from the restaurant carriage wanted
to know if Monsieur wanted lunch,' said the

393
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,170
conductor.

394
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,010
'There was no answer.

395
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,519
I opened the door with my key, but there was
a bolt too.

396
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,779
I called the train manager.

397
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:06,990
We cut through the bolt and went in.

398
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,179
He was - it was terrible.

399
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,470
Terrible!'

400
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,160
He hid his face in his hands.

401
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:25,720
'The door was locked and bolted on the inside,'
said Poirot thoughtfully.

402
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,050
'Perhaps he killed himself?'

403
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:37,940
'Does a man kill himself with twelve knife
wounds in the chest?' asked the doctor.

404
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,610
'It was a woman,' said the train manager,
speaking for the first time.

405
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,039
'Only a woman would kill like that.'

406
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,080
'Then it was a very strong woman,' said the
doctor.

407
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,480
'The knife went through bone in some places.'

408
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,700
'So, my friend, you see our problem.'

409
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,010
M. Bouc looked at the detective.

410
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,010
'Can you help us?'

411
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,950
'What exactly do you want me to do?'

412
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,799
M. Poirot asked.

413
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,889
'Take command of the case!

414
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:22,180
When the police arrive, there will be problems,
delays, unpleasantness.

415
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:30,710
It would be so much better if the case was
already solved when they arrived.

416
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,919
And you are the perfect man for the job.

417
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,269
Examine the body and interview the passengers.

418
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:48,400
You will not be able to check their stories,
but you once said, "To solve a case, a man

419
00:30:48,400 --> 00:31:00,159
just has to he back in his chair and think."

420
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,309
Do that - and you will know!'

421
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:06,500
'I accept the case willingly,' smiled the
detective.

422
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,940
'It will help to pass the time.'

423
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,080
'Wonderful!' said M. Bouc.

424
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,399
'We will help you in any way that we can.'

425
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:26,419
'First, I would like a plan of the carriage
where the murder took place, with a note of

426
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,039
the names of the people in each compartment.

427
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,330
I will also need their passports and tickets.'

428
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,330
'Michel will get you those.'

429
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,759
The conductor left the compartment.

430
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,460
'Who are the other passengers on the train?'
asked M. Poirot.

431
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
'In this carriage, Dr Constantine and I are
the only travellers.

432
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,090
Behind this are the third-class carriages,
but they were locked after dinner last night.

433
00:31:50,090 --> 00:32:07,870
In front, there is only the restaurant carriage.'

434
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:18,809
'So it seems likely that the murderer is now
in the American's carriage,' said Poirot.

435
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,320
'Yes,' agreed Dr Constantine.

436
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,309
'At half past midnight we were stopped by
the snow.

437
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:32,610
No one has left the train since then - or
at least, there are certainly no footprints

438
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,690
in the snow.'

439
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:41,580
'First I would like to speak with young M.
MacQueen,' said Poirot.

440
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,769
'He may be able to give us some useful information.'

441
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:51,549
The train manager fetched MacQueen.

442
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:59,649
'What's the problem?' asked the American nervously
as he sat down opposite Poirot.

443
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,889
'Has anything happened?'

444
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:08,080
'Yes, Monsieur,' answered the detective.

445
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,220
.'Prepare yourself for a shock.

446
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,289
Your employer, M. Ratchett, has been murdered.'

447
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:25,380
MacQueen's eyes seemed brighter, but except
for this he showed no signs of shock.

448
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,789
'So they got him after all,' he said.

449
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,779
'What do you mean, M. MacQueen?'

450
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,429
MacQueen paused.

451
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:38,890
'And you are -?'

452
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:46,880
'I am a detective working for the Compagnie
Internationale des Wagons Lits.

453
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,210
My name is M. Hercule Poirot.

454
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:57,790
Now, please, tell me what you mean, They got
him after all.'

455
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:03,370
'Well, he has been getting letters.

456
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,230
Threatening letters.'

457
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,020
'Did you see them?'

458
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,149
'Yes.

459
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,419
I am - was - his secretary.

460
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:16,020
It was my job to answer his letters.

461
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,359
The first came last week.

462
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,440
Would you like to see it?'

463
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,780
'Yes, that would he most helpful,' replied
the detective.

464
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,409
MacQueen left, and soon returned with a rather
dirty piece of notepaper.

465
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:39,490
Poirot read the carefully printed handwriting:

466
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,300
You thought you could cheat us, didn't you?

467
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,310
Well, you were wrong.

468
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:50,240
We're going to get you, Ratchett!

469
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,700
'And the other letters were similar?' asked
the detective.

470
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,880
'Yes, very similar.

471
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,500
Ratchett pretended to laugh about them, but
I could see that they worried him.'

472
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,099
'How long have you been working for M. Ratchett?'

473
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,490
'A year.

474
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:18,250
He travelled around a lot, but he spoke no
languages except English.

475
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,930
I was more his translator than his secretary.'

476
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:30,240
'Now, tell me as much as you can about your
employer.'

477
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,770
'That's not so easy.'

478
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,770
He looked confused.

479
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,160
'He was an American citizen?'

480
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,550
'Yes.'

481
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,390
'What part of America was he from?'

482
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,700
'I don't know.

483
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,510
I know almost nothing about him.

484
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:59,369
Mr Ratchett never spoke of himself, or his
family, or his life in America.'

485
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:02,680
'Why was that, do you think?'

486
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,819
'Well, I think he was hiding something - something
in his past.

487
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,260
I'm not even sure that Ratchett was his real
name.'

488
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,020
'One last question.

489
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,530
Did you have a good relationship with your
employer?'

490
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,760
'Well, yes, I did.

491
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:32,000
I didn't like him very much as a person, but
I had no problems with him as an employer.'

492
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,640
'You did not like him.

493
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,300
Why was that?'

494
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,710
'I can't exactly say.'

495
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:49,270
He paused, then continued, 'He was, I am sure,
a cruel and dangerous man.

496
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:57,420
I have no reason for this opinion, M. Poirot,
but I feel it very strongly.'

497
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,849
'Thank you for your honesty, Mr MacQueen.'

498
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:10,810
M. Poirot and Dr Constantine went together
to the compartment of the murdered man.

499
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,920
It was freezing cold inside.

500
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,500
The window was pushed down as far as it could
go.

501
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,120
'I did not like to close it,' said the doctor.

502
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:29,140
'Nothing has been touched in here, and I was
careful not to move the body when I examined

503
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,710
it.'

504
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,490
'Good,' said Poirot.

505
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,150
He checked the window for fingerprints, but
there were none.

506
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:43,510
'Criminals these days are always careful about
fingerprints.

507
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,859
And you were right, Doctor.

508
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,859
There are no footprints in the snow.

509
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:58,750
No one left the carriage through this window
- although perhaps the murderer wanted us

510
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,339
to think that he did.'

511
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:08,579
Poirot closed the window and turned his attention
to the body.

512
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,400
Ratchett was lying on his back in the bed.

513
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,780
The detective bent down to look at the wounds.

514
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,290
'How many wounds are there exactly?' he asked.

515
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,650
'Twelve, I think.

516
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:29,790
Some are very slight, but at least three are
serious enough to cause death.

517
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,950
And there is something strange.

518
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:39,079
These two wounds - here and here -' He pointed.

519
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,810
'They are deep, but they have not bled in
the normal way.'

520
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,460
'Which means -?

521
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,240
'That the man was already dead - dead for
some time - when

522
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,650
these wounds were made.

523
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,339
But that seems impossible.'

524
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:05,680
'Unlikely, certainly - unless our murderer
was worried that he hadn't done the job right

525
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,359
the first time and came back to make sure.'

526
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:18,710
He paused, then asked suddenly, 'Were the
lights on?'

527
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,369
'No,' replied the doctor.

528
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:24,930
Poirot thought for a moment.

529
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,750
'So we have two murderers.

530
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,810
The first did his job, then turned off the
light as he left.

531
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:42,720
Later, the second arrived in the dark, did
not see that his or her work had been done

532
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,300
and struck at a dead body.

533
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,710
What do you think?'

534
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,849
'Very good!' said the doctor.

535
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:57,740
'That would also explain why some wounds are
deep but others are so slight.

536
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:03,590
We have a strong murderer and a weaker one.'

537
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:09,300
'Yes, but two independent murderers on the
same night?

538
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,000
It is so unlikely!'

539
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,849
Poirot stopped, then continued, 'Could the
deepest wounds be the work of a woman?'

540
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:28,720
'Perhaps - but only if she was very strong.'

541
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,610
Poirot put his hand under the pillow and pulled
out the gun that Ratchett had shown him the

542
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,440
day before.

543
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,650
'Why didn't the American defend himself?

544
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,920
The bullets are all there, you see.'

545
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,550
They looked round the room.

546
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,450
Ratchett's clothes were hanging tidily behind
the door.

547
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:58,349
On a small table was a bottle of water, an
empty glass, some burnt pieces of paper and

548
00:40:58,349 --> 00:40:59,599
a used match.

549
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,500
The doctor picked up the empty glass and smelled
it.

550
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,859
'This is why Ratchett failed to defend himself.

551
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:11,960
He was drugged.'

552
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,191
Poirot felt in Ratchett's pockets and soon
brought out a box of matches.

553
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:22,670
He compared the matches carefully with the
one on the table.

554
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:32,200
'The match on the table is a different shape
from these - shorter and flatter.

555
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,460
Perhaps it was the murderer's.'

556
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,590
The detective continued to look round the
room.

557
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,690
Then, with a cry, he bent down and picked
up a handkerchief from the floor.

558
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,800
It was small and pretty.

559
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,329
'The train manager was right!' he said.

560
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:56,609
'There is a woman in this case.

561
00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:05,230
And she very conveniently leaves us a clue
- exactly as it happens in the books and films.

562
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:13,630
And to make things even easier for us, there
is a letter H on it.'

563
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:20,040
Poirot made another dive to the floor, and
this time stood up with a pipe cleaner in

564
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
his hand.

565
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,160
'Another convenient clue,' he smiled.

566
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,690
'And this time it suggests a man, not a woman.'

567
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:38,910
The doctor was now looking in the front pocket
of Ratchett's pyjamas.

568
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,310
'Ah!' he said.

569
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,579
'I didn't notice this earlier.'

570
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:48,730
He showed Poirot a gold pocket watch.

571
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:54,680
The case was badly damaged, and the hands
pointed to a quarter past one.

572
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,140
'You see?'

573
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,599
cried Constantine.

574
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,960
'This gives us the hour of the

575
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,960
crime.

576
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,710
It fits perfectly with the medical evidence,
that he died between midnight and 2 a.m.'

577
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:18,369
'It is possible, yes,' said the detective
in a troubled voice.

578
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:24,790
He went back to the little table and examined
the burnt bits of paper.

579
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:30,660
'I need a ladies' hat box!' he said softly.

580
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:37,970
Before Dr Constantine was able to ask why,
Poirot was in the corridor, calling for the

581
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,970
conductor.

582
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:44,829
The conductor soon came in with a hat box
borrowed from one of the lady passengers.

583
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:54,059
'There are so many clues in this room,' Poirot
explained to the doctor, who was looking very

584
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:55,059
confused.

585
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:59,530
'The watch, the pipe cleaner, the handkerchief.

586
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:09,589
But how can we be sure that they are not false
clues, left here to confuse us?

587
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:16,130
I am only sure of two clues - the match and
the burnt paper.

588
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:22,000
The murderer didn't want us to read the words
on that paper.

589
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,960
Let us see.'

590
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:31,040
From the hat box, Poirot took one of the pieces
of shaped wire netting over which a hat would

591
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,430
normally sit.

592
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:39,570
He flattened it, then carefully placed the
burnt pieces of paper on top and covered them

593
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,440
with another piece of wire netting.

594
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,319
He lit a match and held the wire over the
flame.

595
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:56,540
The doctor watched with interest as, slowly,
some words appeared - words of fire.

596
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,250
'-member little Daisy Armstrong.'

597
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,920
'Ah!' cried Poirot.

598
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,030
'So Ratchett was not the dead man's real name.

599
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:14,849
We now know his name, and why he left America.'

600
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:20,490
'We do?' asked the doctor.

601
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,630
'Yes.

602
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,320
We must go and tell M. Bouc.'

603
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:34,930
The two men found M. Bouc finishing lunch
in his compartment.

604
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:42,840
'After lunch, we will empty the restaurant
carriage and use it for your interviews,'

605
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,940
M. Bouc said.

606
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,290
'I have ordered some food for you here.'

607
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:53,180
The doctor and the detective ate quickly.

608
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:00,010
M. Bouc waited until their coffee had been
served, then asked, 'Well?'

609
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:06,500
'I know the real name of the murdered man,'
said Poirot.

610
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,580
'He was Cassetti.

611
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,560
Do you remember the Armstrong case?'

612
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,100
'Yes, I think I do,' answered M. Bouc.

613
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:28,000
'A terrible business - although I cannot remember
the details.'

614
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,059
'Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman, married
to the daughter of America's most famous actress,

615
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,380
Linda Arden.

616
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,579
They were living in America when their three-year-old
daughter was kidnapped.

617
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:52,490
After messages from the kidnappers, the parents
paid them more than two hundred thousand dollars

618
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,740
for her return.

619
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,730
But instead, the child's dead body was discovered.

620
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:07,810
Mrs Armstrong was carrying another baby at
the time, and the shock of her daughter's

621
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,910
murder made her give birth too soon.

622
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:16,650
She and the baby both died.

623
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:20,380
The heartbroken husband then shot himself.'

624
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:26,880
'Yes, I remember now,' M. Bouc said softly.

625
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,260
'And there was another death too, wasn't there?'

626
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,819
'A French or Swiss girl who worked for the
Armstrongs.

627
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:44,020
The police believed that she had helped the
kidnappers, although she strongly denied this.

628
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:48,490
She threw herself out of a window.

629
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:55,280
Later, it was proved that she was completely
innocent.'

630
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,849
'Terrible!' said the doctor.

631
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:05,640
'About six months after these events, the
police caught Cassetti.

632
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:12,230
He was the leader of a team of gangsters who
had kidnapped and killed people in a similar

633
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,690
way before.

634
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:19,990
There was no doubt that he was guilty of the
Armstrong kidnap too.

635
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:28,109
But Cassetti was very rich, and he used his
money to escape punishment for his crimes.

636
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:32,030
After the court case, he disappeared.

637
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:36,240
And now we know where he went.

638
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,970
He changed his name to Ratchett and began
travelling abroad.'

639
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,240
'What an animal!'

640
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,520
cried M. Bouc.

641
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,530
'He got what he deserved.'

642
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,920
'I agree,' said M. Poirot.

643
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,390
'But was the murderer another gangster, or
someone connected to Daisy Armstrong?'

644
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:08,180
'Are there any members of the Armstrong family
living?'

645
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:13,809
'I don't know,' replied the detective.

646
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:19,390
'I seem to remember that Mrs Armstrong had
a younger sister.'

647
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,500
There was a knock at the door.

648
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:29,980
'The restaurant carriage is ready for you,
Monsieur,' said the waiter to M. Bouc.

649
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:37,329
The three men walked down the corridor to
begin the interviews.

650
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:40,820
CHAPTER THREE

651
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,720
A Red Dressing Gown and a Metal Button

652
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:53,230
In the restaurant carriage, everything was
ready - a pile of passports and tickets, a

653
00:49:53,230 --> 00:50:00,119
plan of the carriage with the names of the
passengers marked on it, and writing paper,

654
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,170
a pen and ink.

655
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,150
'Excellent,' said Poirot.

656
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,040
'Our first interview will be with the conductor.

657
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,500
You probably know something about his character,
M. Bouc.

658
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,990
Should we believe his evidence?'

659
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,109
'Definitely,' replied M. Bouc.

660
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:26,760
'Pierre Michel has worked for the company
for fifteen years.

661
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,550
A Frenchman - very honest.'

662
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:32,869
Michel entered the carriage.

663
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:39,430
He seemed less upset than he had been earlier,
but he was still very nervous.

664
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:49,900
'Now, Michel,' said M. Poirot gently, 'we
have to ask you a few things about last night.

665
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,569
M. Ratchett went to bed - when?'

666
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:59,609
'Soon after dinner, Monsieur - before we left
Belgrade.'

667
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:04,970
'Did you see anyone go into his compartment
afterwards?'

668
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:10,270
'His manservant, Monsieur, and his secretary.

669
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,980
No one else.'

670
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,369
'And was that the last time you saw or heard
from him?'

671
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:17,369
'No, Monsieur.

672
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:23,030
He rang his bell at about twenty to one.

673
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:28,450
I knocked, but he called out, 'Ce n'est rieti.

674
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,180
Je me suis trompe.'

675
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,363
'And where were you at a quarter past one?'

676
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:40,200
'Most of the time I was at my seat at the
end of the corridor.

677
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:48,309
Soon after one - I don't know when exactly
- I went to the next carriage to talk to a

678
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:49,680
colleague about the snow.

679
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,670
Then Mrs Hubbard rang, and I spoke to her
for a few minutes.

680
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,390
Then I brought you some water, Monsieur.'

681
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,060
'And later?'

682
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:08,130
'At about two o'clock M. MacQueen asked me
to make his bed.

683
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,849
The English Colonel from number 15 was there
with him.

684
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:18,869
When they had gone to bed, I sat at my seat
until morning.'

685
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,079
'Did you sleep?'

686
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,400
'I don't think so, Monsieur.'

687
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,839
'Did you see any of the passengers in the
corridor?'

688
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:32,180
The conductor thought for a moment.

689
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,369
'One of the ladies went to the toilet.'

690
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:38,140
'Which one?'

691
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:43,520
'I don't know, but she was wearing a red dressing
gown.

692
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,890
It had a Chinese-style picture on the back.'

693
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:50,390
'And after that?'

694
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:56,349
'You yourself opened the door and looked out
for a second.'

695
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,160
'Good,' said Poirot.

696
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,390
'I wondered if you would remember that.

697
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,240
Now, if the murderer came onto the train last
night -'

698
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,109
'There were no strangers on the train last
night, Monsieur.

699
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:19,440
The door to the next carriage was bolted on
the inside.

700
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,910
I opened the side door when we stopped at
Vincovci at twenty past twelve, but I was

701
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,950
standing there all the time.

702
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,089
No one came through it.'

703
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:36,780
'What about the side door beyond the restaurant
carriage?'

704
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,640
'That is always bolted on the inside at night.'

705
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,800
'It isn't bolted now.'

706
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,830
The man looked surprised for a moment.

707
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:55,859
'Perhaps one of the passengers opened it to
look at the snow,' he said finally.

708
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:01,589
'Monsieur, you do not blame me?'

709
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:03,859
Poirot smiled at him kindly.

710
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:07,680
'Of course not, my friend.

711
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,680
Ah!

712
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,829
I have one other thing to ask you.

713
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:18,300
Another bell rang just after you knocked on
M. Ratchett's door.

714
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,050
Whose was it?'

715
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,420
'Princess Dragomiroff's, Monsieur.

716
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,570
She wanted her maid.'

717
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,730
'You called the maid?'

718
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,300
'Yes, Monsieur.'

719
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,670
'That is all.

720
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:39,660
Thank you for your help.'

721
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,480
The conductor left the restaurant carriage
and Poirot called Mr MacQueen for another

722
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,480
interview.

723
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:52,059
When MacQueen learnt that his employer had
been the criminal Cassetti, he was very angry.

724
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:59,970
'How terrible that I helped an evil man like
that!' he cried.

725
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:05,540
'You seem to feel very strongly about this,
M. MacQueen.'

726
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,220
'Yes, I do.

727
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,760
My father was on the legal team in the Armstrong
case.

728
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,720
He knew that Cassetti was guilty, but things
went wrong in court and it couldn't be proved.

729
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:26,560
Well, I'm glad that he's dead - although I
didn't kill him myself, you understand.'

730
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,670
'Of course, of course.

731
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:36,060
Now, I must check the movements of everyone
on the train.

732
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,910
What did you do last night after dinner?'

733
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:44,530
'Well, I talked to some of the other passengers.

734
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:50,260
At about ten o'clock, I went into Mr Ratchett's
compartment and he

735
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,559
asked me to write some letters for him.

736
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,140
Then I got into a long conversation with Colonel
Arbuthnot.'

737
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,890
'Do you know what time you went to bed?'

738
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,440
'About two o'clock, I think.'

739
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,230
'Did you leave the train at any time?'

740
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:16,089
'Arbuthnot and I got out at - what was the
name of the place?

741
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:17,089
- Vincovci.

742
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:22,770
But it was bitterly cold, so we soon came
back in.'

743
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,240
'By which door did you leave the train?'

744
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,980
'By the one next to the restaurant carriage.'

745
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,170
'Do you remember if it was bolted?'

746
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,530
MacQueen stopped to think.

747
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,079
'Yes, I believe it was.'

748
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,829
'And did you bolt it again when you got back
on the train?'

749
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:52,619
'I got on last, and no, I don't think 1 bolted
it.'

750
00:56:52,619 --> 00:57:01,200
'When you were with Colonel Arbuthnot,' continued
the detective, 'the door of your compartment

751
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,900
was open, I think.

752
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:10,200
Please tell me who passed along the corridor
after the train left Vincovci.'

753
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:17,550
'The conductor - and a woman too, going towards
the restaurant carriage.'

754
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,670
'Which woman?'

755
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,359
'I don't know.

756
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:25,480
I just remember seeing a thin red dressing
gown.

757
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,970
She was probably going to the toilet.'

758
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,280
'Did you see her return?'

759
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,609
'Well, no, I don't remember seeing her.'

760
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:39,260
'One more question.

761
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,160
Do you smoke a pipe?'

762
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:46,079
'No, sir, I don't,' replied MacQueen.

763
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,270
'I think that is all at present.

764
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,150
Thank you for your time.

765
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:56,359
I would now like to speak to M. Ratchett's
manservant.'

766
00:57:56,359 --> 00:58:01,300
The American left and the thin, pale Englishman
arrived.

767
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,960
The detective picked up his passport.

768
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:12,690
'You are the manservant of M. Ratchett - Edward
Henry Masterman, age thirty-nine, a British

769
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,710
citizen?'

770
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,760
'Yes, sir.'

771
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:22,230
'You have heard that your employer has been
murdered?'

772
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,970
'Yes, sir.

773
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,570
A terrible crime.'

774
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:31,150
'Please tell me when you last saw M. Ratchett.'

775
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:35,270
'It was at about nine o'clock last night,
sir.

776
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:40,760
I went to Mr Ratchett as usual, and helped
him to get ready for bed.'

777
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,490
'What sort of mood was he in?'

778
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:46,440
'Not a good one, sir.

779
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,410
He had just read a letter and I think he was
upset about it.

780
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,750
He criticised everything that I did.'

781
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,200
'Was that unusual?'

782
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,830
'No, sir.

783
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,910
He lost his temper easily.'

784
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:10,220
'Did M. Ratchett ever take any medicine to
help him sleep?'

785
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,059
Dr Constantine moved forward a little to hear
his answer.

786
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:16,430
'Always, sir, when he was travelling.

787
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,640
He said that he could not sleep without it.'

788
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,810
'Did he take it last night?'

789
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,980
'Yes, sir.

790
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:30,260
I poured it into a glass for him myself.'

791
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:35,589
'Did you like your employer, M. Masterman?'

792
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:38,869
The manservant's face showed no emotion.

793
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:45,680
'He paid me well, sir - but I'm not very fond
of Americans.'

794
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,220
'Have you ever been to America?'

795
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,780
'No, sir.'

796
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,450
'And what did you do after leaving M. Ratchett
last night?'

797
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,930
'I told Mr MacQueen that he was wanted.

798
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,740
Then I went back to my own compartment and
read.'

799
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,410
'You were in compartment number 4.'

800
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:12,260
'Yes, sir, with a big Italian man.'

801
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,870
'Does the Italian speak English?'

802
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,590
'Well, a kind of English, sir.

803
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:22,920
He's been in America - Chicago, I understand.

804
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,099
We do not talk much.

805
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,410
I prefer to read.'

806
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,799
'What time did you go to sleep?'

807
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:36,140
'I went to bed at about ten thirty, sir, but
I didn't sleep.

808
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,660
I had toothache.'

809
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:40,089
'Did you not sleep at all?'

810
01:00:40,089 --> 01:00:42,150
'Yes, in the end.

811
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:46,270
But not until about four in the morning.'

812
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,050
'Did you leave your compartment during the
night?'

813
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,800
'No, sir.'

814
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,880
'And the Italian?'

815
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,600
'No, sir.

816
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,789
He slept all night.'

817
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:01,280
'One last question.

818
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,770
Do you smoke a pipe?'

819
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,190
'No, sir.

820
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,030
I only smoke cigarettes.'

821
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,859
'Thank you, Mr Masterman.

822
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:12,730
I think that is all.'

823
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:19,896
'Excuse me, sir, but the American lady, Mrs
Hubbard, says she knows all about the murderer.

824
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:23,030
She is very upset, sir.'

825
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:30,549
'Then we should see her next, I think,' said
Poirot, smiling.

826
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:38,329
Mrs Hubbard entered the restaurant carriage
talking excitedly.

827
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:47,329
'Now who's in charge here, because I have
some very important information.

828
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,329
Very important.'

829
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,329
'Please, Madame, sit,' said Poirot.

830
01:01:49,329 --> 01:01:51,600
'Then tell me everything.'

831
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,180
'Well, I will tell you this.

832
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:04,720
There was a murder on the train last night,
and the murderer was in my compartment!'

833
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,000
'You are sure of this, Madame?'

834
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,549
'Of course I'm sure!

835
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:13,549
I was asleep, and suddenly I woke up.

836
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:19,960
It was dark - and I knew that there was a
man in my compartment.

837
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,700
I was so frightened that I couldn't scream.

838
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,970
I thought, "I'm going to be killed!"

839
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:34,770
It was so terrible - these nasty trains, and
the horrible things that happen on them!

840
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:42,579
And then I thought, "Well, he won't get my
jewellery," because I'd hidden it under my

841
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:43,579
pillow.

842
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:46,010
Very uncomfortable, I can tell you.

843
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,510
But that's not important.

844
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:50,520
Where was I?'

845
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,980
'You realised that there was a man in your
compartment.'

846
01:02:53,980 --> 01:03:00,119
'Yes, well, I just lay there with my eyes
closed for some time.

847
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:04,849
Then I felt for the bell with my hand and
pressed it to call the conductor.

848
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,579
I rang and rang, but nothing happened.

849
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:17,000
"Maybe they've already murdered everyone else
on the train," I thought.

850
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,910
Then finally the conductor came in.

851
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,819
I switched on the lights, but

852
01:03:24,819 --> 01:03:28,740
there wasn't anyone there at all.'

853
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:34,569
Judging by Mrs Hubbard's voice, she thought
that her last words were the most exciting

854
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:37,250
part of her story.

855
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,190
'And what happened next, Madame?'

856
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,190
'Well, I told the conductor what had happened,
and he didn't seem to believe me.

857
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:54,150
Clearly the man had got away, but the conductor
only wanted to calm me down!

858
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:00,900
Well, at the time I was worried that the man
was the one from the next-door compartment.

859
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:07,990
I asked the conductor to look at the door
between the compartments, and of course it

860
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,990
wasn't bolted.

861
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:16,920
Well, I bolted it immediately, and put a suitcase
against it too.'

862
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:25,650
'And do you think the man in your compartment
went into Mr Ratchett's compartment, or out

863
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,810
into the corridor?'

864
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:30,130
'How could I know that?

865
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:33,309
My eyes were tight shut.

866
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:39,029
Oh, if my daughter knew how frightened I was!'

867
01:04:39,029 --> 01:04:45,940
'Perhaps, Madame, you heard someone not in
your own compartment but in the compartment

868
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,890
of the murdered man.'

869
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,480
'Certainly not!

870
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,450
And I can prove it!'

871
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:58,660
From her handbag, she produced a small metal
button.

872
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,960
'You see this?

873
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,849
I found it this morning in my compartment.'

874
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:14,569
As she placed the button on the table, M.
Bouc cried, 'This is a button from a conductor's

875
01:05:14,569 --> 01:05:15,569
uniform!'

876
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:22,869
'It probably fell off Michel's uniform when
he was helping Madame Hubbard last night,'

877
01:05:22,869 --> 01:05:23,869
said Poirot.

878
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:28,150
'Why don't you people believe me?'

879
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,099
cried the American woman.

880
01:05:30,099 --> 01:05:34,619
'At bedtime last night I was reading a magazine.

881
01:05:34,619 --> 01:05:41,609
When I switched off the light, I put the magazine
on the floor near the window.

882
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:50,986
Last night, after the man had been in my room,
the conductor went nowhere near the window,

883
01:05:50,986 --> 01:05:59,300
but in the morning the button was on top of
the magazine.

884
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,300
What do you call that?'

885
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,480
'I call that evidence, Madame,' replied the
detective seriously.

886
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,470
'Now, can I ask you a few questions?'

887
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:13,380
'Of course,' said Mrs Hubbard.

888
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:17,040
'You were nervous of this man Ratchett.

889
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:22,319
So why had you not already bolted the door
between the compartments?'

890
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:23,779
'I had.

891
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:30,690
Or at least, I had asked that Swedish lady
if it was bolted, and she had said that it

892
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:31,890
was.'

893
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:34,460
'Why couldn't you see for yourself?'

894
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:41,029
'I was in bed and my sponge bag was hanging
on the door handle.'

895
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:43,180
'When was this?'

896
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,160
'About half past ten, I think.

897
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,290
The Swedish lady had come to ask me for an
aspirin.'

898
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:55,200
'Do you remember the case of the Armstrong
kidnap?'

899
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,630
'Of course I do.

900
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:03,630
I didn't know the Armstrongs personally.

901
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,099
They moved in higher society than I.

902
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:08,220
But I've always heard that they were a lovely
couple.

903
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:13,230
Oh, that evil man Cassetti -'

904
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,809
'Ratchett was Cassetti,' said Poirot.

905
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:19,920
'Cassetti, on this train!

906
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,040
I can't believe it!

907
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,930
I must tell my daughter.'

908
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:30,660
'Now, Madame, just one more thing.

909
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,700
Do you have a red dressing gown?'

910
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,599
'What an odd question!

911
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:39,450
No, I don't.'

912
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,420
Poirot helped her towards the door.

913
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:51,319
At the last moment he said, 'You have dropped
your handkerchief, Madame.'

914
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:55,529
She looked at the little piece of material
that he was holding out to her.

915
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,460
'That isn't mine.

916
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:03,230
It's much too small - mine are a sensible
size.'

917
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,799
'Ah!' said the detective.

918
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:08,309
'It had an H on it.

919
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:10,460
I thought it must be yours.'

920
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,560
CHAPTER FOUR

921
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,210
An Open Door

922
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:22,010
As Mrs Hubbard left, M. Bouc said anxiously,
'I hope this button doesn't mean that Pierre

923
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:26,510
Michel is the murderer.'

924
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:33,270
'That button is interesting,' said Poirot.

925
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:39,921
'But let us interview the Swedish lady before
we discuss it.'

926
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:44,120
He looked through the pile of passports.

927
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,240
'Here we are.

928
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,400
Greta Ohlsson, age forty-nine.'

929
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,750
M. Bouc asked the waiter to invite her in.

930
01:08:54,750 --> 01:09:00,310
The woman with a sheep-like face and fair
hair entered.

931
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,020
She looked quite calm.

932
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:08,100
'You know what happened last night?' asked
Poirot.

933
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,100
'Yes.

934
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,940
It is terrible,' she replied.

935
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:20,970
'You will understand, Mademoiselle, that I
must ask everyone about their movements last

936
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,270
night after dinner.'

937
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,790
'Of course.

938
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:34,850
Well, I spent most of the evening in my compartment,
but I did go to see the American lady, Mrs

939
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,970
Hubbard.

940
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,310
She gave me some aspirin.'

941
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:46,600
'Did she ask if the door between her compartment
and Mr Ratchett's was bolted?'

942
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,290
'Yes, she did.

943
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,100
And it was.'

944
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,340
'And after that?'

945
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:59,980
'I went back to my bed, took the aspirin and
fell asleep.'

946
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,110
'Your compartment is this one?'

947
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,760
He pointed to the plan.

948
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,430
'Yes, I think so.

949
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:13,360
I am sharing with a young English lady.

950
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,720
Very nice.

951
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,950
She has travelled from Baghdad.'

952
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:22,750
'Did she leave the compartment during the
night?'

953
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,470
'No, I am sure she did not.'

954
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:30,680
'Why are you sure if you were asleep?'

955
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,330
'I wake very easily.

956
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,700
She was sleeping in the bed above mine.

957
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,680
I always notice when she comes down.'

958
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,380
'Did you leave the compartment?'

959
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:48,250
'Not until this morning.'

960
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:53,050
'Do you have a red dressing gown?'

961
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:55,630
'No, I do not.

962
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:56,630
Mine is brown.'

963
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:02,290
'Have you ever been to America, Mademoiselle?'

964
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:04,590
'Sadly, no.

965
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:06,890
I like the Americans.

966
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:11,870
They give a lot of money to schools and hospitals
in Turkey.

967
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:16,000
Why do you ask?'

968
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,780
Poirot explained about the Armstrong case.

969
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:26,120
Greta Ohlsson left the interview room shaking
her head and crying, 'How can there be such

970
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:32,610
evil in the world?'

971
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:36,970
Poirot spent some time writing notes.

972
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:44,700
'The conductor said that Mrs Hubbard's bell
rang some time after 1 a.m.'

973
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:54,100
'Yes, it seems quite clear that the murder
happened at 1.15,' said M. Bouc.

974
01:11:54,100 --> 01:12:00,190
'That fits the evidence of the watch and the
stories of the conductor and Mrs Hubbard.

975
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:05,850
And I think I can guess who the murderer is.

976
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:09,670
It is the big Italian.

977
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:16,740
Italians always kill with a knife, and this
one has lived in America.

978
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:23,920
He and Ratchett probably worked in this kidnapping
business together.

979
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,060
Then Ratchett cheated him.

980
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,210
The Italian wanted revenge.

981
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:37,290
He sent threatening letters and then he killed
him.

982
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,860
Very simple.'

983
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:45,010
'Simple except for the manservant with the
toothache, who says that the Italian never

984
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:48,620
left the compartment,' said Poirot.

985
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:57,800
'Yes, that is a difficulty, but it will all
be explained,' said M. Bouc confidently.

986
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,900
The detective shook his head.

987
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,730
'No, it is not as simple as that, I fear.

988
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:12,950
But let us hear what Pierre Michel can tell
us about this button.'

989
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:17,700
The conductor was called and shown the button.

990
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:26,830
'It seems certain,' said M. Bouc, 'that the
murderer passed through Mrs Hubbard's compartment

991
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,870
and dropped that button.'

992
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,450
Michel was very upset.

993
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:35,480
'It is not mine, Monsieur!

994
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:39,720
Look - my uniform has lost no buttons.

995
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:43,760
I am innocent of this crime!'

996
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,450
'Where were you when Mrs Hubbard's bell rang?'

997
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:51,380
'In the next carriage, Monsieur.

998
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:55,220
I was talking to a colleague.'

999
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:57,490
The colleague was called.

1000
01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:00,230
His story agreed with Michel's.

1001
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:09,130
The buttons of all the other conductors' uniforms
were checked, and none were missing.

1002
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:12,950
'Monsieur, do you see now?

1003
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:16,010
I am not guilty!'

1004
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,540
cried Michel.

1005
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,230
'Calm yourself, Michel,' said M. Bouc.

1006
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:23,230
'Think back to last

1007
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,230
night.

1008
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:32,820
When you ran to answer Mrs Hubbard's bell,
did you see anyone in the corridor?'

1009
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:35,060
'No, Monsieur.'

1010
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:39,910
'That is no surprise,' said Poirot.

1011
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:46,920
'Mrs Hubbard lay with her eyes closed for
some time after she realised that there was

1012
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,000
someone in her compartment.

1013
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,060
The man probably went out then.

1014
01:14:53,060 --> 01:15:00,550
If the murderer was one of the passengers,
he had time to get back to his own compartment

1015
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,750
before Michel arrived.'

1016
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:10,550
'We still have eight passengers to interview,'
said M. Bouc.

1017
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:15,240
'Shall we see the Italian next?'

1018
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:19,740
'You think only of your Italian!'

1019
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,320
laughed Poirot.

1020
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,760
'No, we will see the Princess first.

1021
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,770
Michel, could you ask her to come in?'

1022
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:38,360
Princess Dragomiroff looked even uglier than
the day before, but intelligence and energy

1023
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,110
shone from her small, dark eyes.

1024
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:48,780
As M. Bouc apologised for troubling her, she
stopped him in her deep, clear voice.

1025
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:53,940
'Murder is a serious matter, Monsieur.

1026
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:59,680
I am happy to help you in any way that I can.'

1027
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,700
'Thank you, Madame,' said Poirot.

1028
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:12,000
'You are Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, travelling
to your home in Paris?'

1029
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,040
'Yes.

1030
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:18,210
My maid is with me.'

1031
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:23,350
'Please could you tell us your movements last
night after dinner?'

1032
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,350
'Willingly.

1033
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:29,390
I went to bed straight after the meal.

1034
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:33,740
I read until eleven, then turned out the light.

1035
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:40,120
I was unable to sleep because of pains that
I often have in my legs.

1036
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,710
At about a quarter to one I rang for my maid.

1037
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:49,410
She read to me until I felt sleepy.

1038
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:54,520
I am not sure exactly when she left me.

1039
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,270
After half an hour, perhaps.'

1040
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:03,990
'You have been in America, I suppose, Madame?'

1041
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:08,180
The sudden change of subject surprised the
old lady.

1042
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,180
'Many times.'

1043
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:17,890
'Did you at any time meet a family called
Armstrong?'

1044
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:28,820
Her voice shook as she said, 'If you mean
Sonia and Robert Armstrong, then yes.

1045
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:32,310
Sonia was my goddaughter.

1046
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:35,350
Her mother,

1047
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:39,150
the actress Linda Arden, was a close friend
of mine.'

1048
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:44,080
'Linda Arden is dead now?'

1049
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,970
'She is alive, but she sees no one.

1050
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,540
Her health is very poor.'

1051
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:57,120
'There was, I think, a second daughter?'

1052
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,900
'Yes, much younger than Mrs Armstrong.'

1053
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:06,020
'Where is she now?'

1054
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,680
The old woman looked at him in surprise.

1055
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:16,700
'What connection do these questions have with
the murder on this train?'

1056
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:24,270
'The murdered man was responsible for the
kidnap and murder of Mrs Armstrong's child.'

1057
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:27,190
'Ah!'

1058
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:32,720
Princess Dragomiroff sat straighter in her
chair.

1059
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,950
'Then this murder is a very happy event.

1060
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:42,160
You will excuse my strong opinion on the subject.'

1061
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,700
'Of course, Madame.

1062
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:49,180
Now we must return to my earlier question.

1063
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:53,970
Where is the younger daughter of Linda Arden?'

1064
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:58,380
'I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur.

1065
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,570
I have lost contact with her.

1066
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:10,970
I believe she married an Englishman some years
ago, but I'm afraid I cannot remember his

1067
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,970
name.'

1068
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:18,750
She paused for a minute and then said, 'Is
there anything else, gentlemen?'

1069
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:22,270
'Just one thing, Madame.

1070
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:25,070
The colour of your dressing gown.'

1071
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:31,120
'I suppose you have a good reason for asking
this.

1072
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,400
It is blue.'

1073
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,680
'That is all.

1074
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:42,310
Thank you for your help.'

1075
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:47,271
Count and Countess Andrenyi were called next,
but the Count entered the restaurant carriage

1076
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:48,271
alone.

1077
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:56,260
He was a fine-looking man - tall, well-built,
with a long moustache and dressed in an expensive

1078
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,630
English suit.

1079
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:03,801
'Well, gentlemen,' he said, 'what can I do
for you?'

1080
01:20:03,801 --> 01:20:14,580
'As you know,' said Poirot, 'there was a murder
here last night, and I must ask certain questions

1081
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,020
of the passengers.'

1082
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,040
'Of course.

1083
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:25,380
I am afraid, though, that my wife and I were
asleep and heard nothing at all.'

1084
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,790
'Do you know who was murdered, Monsieur?'

1085
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:34,510
'The big American, I understand.'

1086
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,510
'Yes.

1087
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:37,460
His name was Cassetti.

1088
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:43,850
He was responsible for some terrible crimes
in America.'

1089
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:48,180
The Count showed no sign of emotion at this
news.

1090
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:54,910
'That explains his murder, I suppose,' he
said.

1091
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:58,210
'You have been to America perhaps, Monsieur?'

1092
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:03,270
'I was in Washington for a year.'

1093
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:10,110
'Did you know the Armstrong family?'

1094
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,440
'Armstrong - Armstrong - it is difficult to
remember.

1095
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,190
There were so many names.'

1096
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:19,600
He smiled.

1097
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,481
'But returning to the murder, gentleman, what
more can I do to help you?'

1098
01:21:22,481 --> 01:21:28,460
'When did you go to bed last night, Monsieur?'

1099
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,640
'At about eleven o'clock.

1100
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,500
We both slept until morning and noticed nothing.

1101
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,120
I am sorry we cannot help you in any way.'

1102
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,120
'Thank you, Monsieur.'

1103
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,120
'You won't need to speak to my wife.

1104
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:49,530
She can tell you nothing more than I have.'

1105
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,230
Poirot's expression changed slightly.

1106
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:56,890
'I am sure that is true,' he said.

1107
01:21:56,890 --> 01:22:01,250
'But I must have a little talk with the Countess.'

1108
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:06,930
'It is quite unnecessary,' said the Count.

1109
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:13,320
'I'm afraid it is necessary - for my report,
you understand.'

1110
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:19,100
'As you wish,' he said, and went to tell her.

1111
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:25,140
Poirot looked at the Count's passport.

1112
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,850
Travelling with wife, he read.

1113
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:38,600
Name: Elena Maria Andrenyi Surname before
marriage: Goldenberg Age: 20

1114
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:45,200
An ink spot had been dropped on the page by
a careless official.

1115
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,740
Countess Andrenyi entered the restaurant carriage.

1116
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:52,470
'You wish to see me, gentlemen?'

1117
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,700
she asked in perfect French.

1118
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,340
'Thank you, Countess,' said Poirot.

1119
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:06,060
'I only need to ask you if you saw or heard
anything unusual last night.'

1120
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,540
'No, nothing.

1121
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,910
I had taken medicine to help me sleep.'

1122
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:18,520
'Did you go with your husband to America,
Madame?'

1123
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,200
'No, Monsieur.

1124
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,530
We were not married then.

1125
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:26,960
We have only been married a year.'

1126
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,360
She smiled shyly.

1127
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:37,400
With her big, dark eyes and bright red lips,
she looked very foreign - and very beautiful.

1128
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:41,340
'Why did you ask me that?'

1129
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:46,700
'Detectives have to ask a lot of strange questions.

1130
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:51,200
For example, what colour is your dressing
gown?'

1131
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,890
'It is a cream colour.

1132
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:57,100
Is that important?'

1133
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,580
'Very important.

1134
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:04,050
And does your husband smoke a pipe?'

1135
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:08,700
'No - cigarettes, but not a pipe.'

1136
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:14,700
'Do you speak English?' he asked in that language.

1137
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,830
'I speak a little, yes.'

1138
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:23,080
Her accent was strong, but very attractive.

1139
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,940
'And that is all,' the detective said.

1140
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:33,950
'You see, Madame, it was not so terrible.'

1141
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:35,870
She smiled and walked out of the carriage.

1142
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:39,900
'That was not very useful,' said M. Bouc.

1143
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:46,550
'Shall we see the Italian now?'

1144
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,470
Poirot did not reply for a moment.

1145
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:54,790
He was studying the ink spot on the Hungarian
passport.

1146
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:58,660
Finally he looked at M. Bouc.

1147
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:04,830
'We will leave your Italian for the moment,
my friend, and interview the good-looking

1148
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:07,870
Englishman, Colonel Arbuthnot.'

1149
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:18,350
When the Colonel arrived, Poirot said, 'You
are travelling from India to Britain, I think.

1150
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,380
Why are you not going by boat?'

1151
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:30,370
'I chose to take the overland route for reasons
of my own,' said the Colonel unhelpfully.

1152
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:32,620
'I see.

1153
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,730
You came straight through from India?'

1154
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:43,080
'I stopped for three days in Baghdad to visit
an old friend.'

1155
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,330
'You met the young English lady there, perhaps
- Miss Debenham?'

1156
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,330
'No, I did not.

1157
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:54,200
I first met Miss Debenham on the train.'

1158
01:25:54,200 --> 01:26:02,790
'We think that M. Ratchett was murdered at
a quarter past one last night.

1159
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,232
What were you doing at that time?'

1160
01:26:04,232 --> 01:26:12,240
'I was talking to the young American - the
dead man's secretary.

1161
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,230
We were in his compartment.'

1162
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:19,130
'Did you know M. MacQueen before this journey?'

1163
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,430
'No.

1164
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,750
We started talking yesterday and we enjoyed
each other's company.

1165
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:29,470
I don't usually like Americans, but I like
MacQueen.

1166
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:36,820
We had a long discussion about India, and
America, and the world in general.

1167
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:43,120
I was quite surprised when I looked at my
watch and found that it was a quarter to two.'

1168
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:48,090
'That is the time that you stopped this conversation?'

1169
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:49,210
'Yes.'

1170
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:51,590
'What did you do then?'

1171
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:56,890
'I walked back to my own compartment and went
to bed.'

1172
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:03,500
'Now, Colonel, I want you to think back to
your conversation with M. MacQueen.

1173
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,600
You got out at Vincovci?'

1174
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,820
'Yes, but only for about a minute.

1175
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:14,660
It was snowing very hard.'

1176
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,660
'So you came back in.

1177
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,790
You sat down again.

1178
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:28,060
You smoked - perhaps a cigarette, perhaps
a pipe He paused for a moment.

1179
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,900
'A pipe for me.

1180
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,380
MacQueen smoked cigarettes.'

1181
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:37,420
'The train started again.

1182
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:41,250
Did anyone pass the door after that?'

1183
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:46,300
'I don't remember anyone except the conductor.

1184
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,850
Wait a minute - there was a woman too, I think.

1185
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:52,630
She was wearing something red.'

1186
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:54,570
'Thank you.

1187
01:27:54,570 --> 01:28:00,300
Have you ever been in America, Colonel?'

1188
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:01,990
'Never.

1189
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:12,800
I have no interest in going there.'

1190
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,800
'Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?'

1191
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,090
'Armstrong - Armstrong - I've known two or
three Armstrongs.

1192
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,610
Do you mean Selby Armstrong?

1193
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,610
Or Tommy?'

1194
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:28,160
'I mean Colonel Robert Armstrong, who married
an American and whose only child was kidnapped

1195
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,160
and killed.'

1196
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,250
'Ah, I remember reading about that.

1197
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:36,720
But I didn't know him.'

1198
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,360
'The murdered man was responsible for that
kidnap.'

1199
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,360
'Really?

1200
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,360
Then he deserved to die - although it's a
pity that it wasn't done legally, through

1201
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:47,250
the courts, of course.

1202
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:55,410
You can't go around murdering people out of
revenge, like Corsicans.'

1203
01:28:55,410 --> 01:29:00,390
Poirot looked at the Colonel thoughtfully.

1204
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:10,690
'I have no more questions - unless you noticed
anything unusual last night?'

1205
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:13,760
Arbuthnot thought for a moment.

1206
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,121
'No,' he said.

1207
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,121
'Nothing.

1208
01:29:16,121 --> 01:29:17,121
Unless -' He paused.

1209
01:29:17,121 --> 01:29:18,121
'Yes?' said the detective.

1210
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:19,121
'Well, it's nothing really.

1211
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:29,249
But when I got back to my compartment, I noticed
that the door of the end compartment -'

1212
01:29:29,249 --> 01:29:30,830
'Number 16?'

1213
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:38,010
'Yes, the door to it was not quite closed.

1214
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:46,350
The man inside looked out in a secretive way,
then quickly closed the door.

1215
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:48,560
It seemed a bit strange.'

1216
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,530
'Yes,' said Poirot doubtfully.

1217
01:29:53,530 --> 01:30:00,990
When the soldier had left the carriage, Poirot
stared into space for some time.

1218
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:06,980
Then he said, 'Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a
pipe.

1219
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:12,580
In M. Ratchett's compartment I found a pipe
cleaner.'

1220
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:17,140
'You think -?' began M. Bouc.

1221
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:21,980
'He was also in the same army as Colonel Armstrong.

1222
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:30,770
He said that he did not know him, but perhaps
that was a lie.'

1223
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:33,590
'So it is possible that -?'

1224
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:35,770
Poirot shook his head angrily.

1225
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:44,170
'No, it is impossible that this Englishman,
who believes in law and order, could push

1226
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:48,140
a knife into his enemy twelve times.'

1227
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,520
CHAPTER FIVE

1228
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,620
The Man with a Woman's Voice

1229
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:02,210
The detective's thoughts turned to the next
interview.

1230
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:07,570
'The American in compartment 16, I think.'

1231
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:14,540
The American soon came in, wearing a brightly
coloured suit and a pink shirt.

1232
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,940
He had a wide, friendly face.

1233
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:22,200
'Good morning, gentlemen,' he said.

1234
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:27,310
'What can I do for you?'

1235
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:34,980
'You have heard of this murder, Mr - er - Hardman?'

1236
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:35,980
'Yes.'

1237
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,960
'We are interviewing all the passengers.

1238
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:46,020
You are -' Poirot looked quickly at the passport
in front of him.

1239
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:53,420
'- forty-one years of age, and a salesman
of office machines?'

1240
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:57,290
'Yes, that's me.'

1241
01:31:57,290 --> 01:32:01,420
'You are travelling for business reasons?'

1242
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:04,350
'That's right.'

1243
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:09,250
'Can you tell us anything about the events
of last night?'

1244
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:12,310
'Nothing at all.

1245
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,330
Sorry.'

1246
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:16,820
'Ah, that is a pity.

1247
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:26,090
Perhaps, Mr Hardman, you will tell us exactly
what you did after dinner last night?'

1248
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:33,360
Hardman paused, then said, 'Excuse me, but
who are you exactly?'

1249
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:38,610
'I am Hercule Poirot.

1250
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:45,360
I have been hired by the Compagnie Internationale
des Wagons Lits to solve this crime.'

1251
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:51,990
'I've heard of you,' said Mr Hardman.

1252
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:52,990
He thought for a

1253
01:32:52,990 --> 01:33:01,020
minute more, then said, 'I suppose I should
be honest.'

1254
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:08,170
'You should certainly tell us all that you
know,' said Poirot.

1255
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:12,770
The American now spoke in a different voice
- in fact, he seemed a completely different

1256
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:14,090
person.

1257
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:18,020
'Well, as I said, I don't know anything.

1258
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,470
But I should know something.'

1259
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,430
'Please explain, Mr Hardman.'

1260
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:28,510
'Some of the information in my passport is
false.

1261
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,510
This is who I really am.'

1262
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:35,630
He produced a card from his pocket.

1263
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:38,160
Mr CYRUS B. HARDMAN

1264
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:41,610
McNeil's Private Detectives

1265
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:42,610
New York

1266
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:46,110
Poirot knew the name of the company.

1267
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:48,790
McNeil's had an excellent reputation.

1268
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:56,230
'I'd gone to Istanbul after a couple of criminals
- no connection with this business.

1269
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:00,920
I was planning my journey home to New York
when I got this.'

1270
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,550
He pushed across a letter.

1271
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,430
Dear Sir,

1272
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:10,770
I understand that you are a private detective.

1273
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:14,830
Please come to my rooms at four o'clock this
afternoon.

1274
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:24,810
It was written on notepaper from the Tokatlian
Hotel in Istanbul and was signed 'S.E.

1275
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:25,810
Ratchett'.

1276
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:32,461
'I went to see Ratchett, and he showed me
some threatening letters that he had received.

1277
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:37,940
He hired me for protection on his journey
west.

1278
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:42,880
Well, my protection wasn't very good, was
it?'

1279
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,140
'How had you hoped to protect him?'

1280
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:50,910
'I had planned to travel in the next-door
compartment, but it was taken.

1281
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:54,890
Number 16 was in a good position, though.

1282
01:34:54,890 --> 01:35:01,420
No one could reach Mr Ratchett's compartment
without passing mine.'

1283
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:09,340
'You had no idea, I suppose, who the possible
attacker was?'

1284
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:14,090
'Well, I knew what he looked like.

1285
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:16,040
Mr Ratchett described him to me.'

1286
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,040
'What?'

1287
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,150
His three listeners almost jumped out of their
seats.

1288
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:22,050
Hardman continued.

1289
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:26,670
'A small man, dark, with a high voice

1290
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,250
like a woman's.

1291
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:31,690
That's how Ratchett described him.'

1292
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:36,150
'Did you know that Ratchett was Cassetti,
the Armstrong murderer?'

1293
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:37,620
Mr Hardman looked shocked.

1294
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,450
'No, I didn't recognise him.

1295
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:50,360
I'd seen photos of Cassetti in the papers,
I suppose, but I wouldn't recognise my own

1296
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:53,090
mother in one of those photos.'

1297
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:58,620
'Please, M. Hardman, continue your story.'

1298
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,620
'There's not much to tell.

1299
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:08,130
I slept in the day and stayed awake watching
the corridor at night.

1300
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:13,320
Nothing happened the first night and I thought
the same was true last night.

1301
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,620
No stranger passed.'

1302
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:20,570
'You are sure of that, M. Hardman?'

1303
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,970
'Yes, I am.

1304
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:24,580
I'm certain.'

1305
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,920
'Then I think we have finished.

1306
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,740
Thank you.'

1307
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,760
Poirot offered the American a cigarette.

1308
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,870
'But perhaps you prefer a pipe?'

1309
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,170
'Not me.

1310
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:42,360
It was nice to meet you, Mr Poirot.'

1311
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:47,240
He took a cigarette and walked away.

1312
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,560
The three men looked at each other.

1313
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:59,820
'A small man, dark, with a high voice like
a woman's,' said M. Bouc thoughtfully.

1314
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:05,720
'A description which fits no one on the train,'
said Poirot.

1315
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:14,740
He paused, then said with a smile, 'And now
we will make M. Bouc happy.

1316
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:19,630
We will see the Italian.'

1317
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:29,440
A man with dark skin and a pleasant, cheerful
face was soon walking across the restaurant

1318
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,420
carriage towards them.

1319
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:37,660
'Your name is Antonio Foscarelli, from Italy?'

1320
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:43,290
'Yes, Monsieur, but I have become an American
citizen.

1321
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:46,770
It is better for my business.'

1322
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,410
He smiled.

1323
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:52,490
'You sell Ford motor cars?'

1324
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:54,940
'Yes, you see -'

1325
01:37:54,940 --> 01:38:02,370
A long explanation of Foscarelli's business
methods followed, before Poirot could continue

1326
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:04,210
his questions.

1327
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:10,200
'So you have lived in the United States for
the last ten years?'

1328
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,330
'Yes, Monsieur.

1329
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:16,090
I remember the day that I left.

1330
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,810
My mother -'

1331
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:19,620
Poirot interrupted him.

1332
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:24,220
'Did you ever meet Mr Ratchett in America?'

1333
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:28,860
'No, but I met many people like him.

1334
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:37,940
On the outside, very polite, very well-dressed,
but underneath - evil.

1335
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:42,090
In my opinion, Ratchett was a criminal.'

1336
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:47,320
'Your opinion is correct,' said Poirot.

1337
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:51,020
'Ratchett was Cassetti, the kidnapper.'

1338
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,610
'What did I tell you?

1339
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:57,230
I am good at reading people's faces.

1340
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:00,680
It is important in my work.'

1341
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,830
'You remember the Armstrong case?'

1342
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:07,710
'Not very well.

1343
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:14,450
It was a little girl, wasn't it?

1344
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:17,750
A terrible crime, but these things happen,
even in a great country like America.'

1345
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:24,150
'Did you ever meet any members of the Armstrong
family?'

1346
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:30,840
'I don't think so, but it is difficult to
say.

1347
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,360
Last year alone I sold cars to -'

1348
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,360
Poirot interrupted him again.

1349
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:42,410
'Monsieur, please tell me what you did last
night after dinner.'

1350
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:43,850
'With pleasure.

1351
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:48,160
I went back to my compartment.

1352
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,890
An English servant shares the compartment
with me but he was out.

1353
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:52,890
Then he came back, but he wasn't interested
in talking.

1354
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,890
"Yes", "No" - nothing else.

1355
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:54,890
He was very unfriendly.

1356
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:55,890
He read his book and I read mine.

1357
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:57,270
I smoked a cigarette or two.

1358
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:10,250
He had toothache, and he was making a lot
of noise about it.

1359
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:25,810
I went to sleep, but I woke up a few times
to the sound of his complaining.'

1360
01:40:25,810 --> 01:40:31,080
'Did he leave the compartment at all during
the night?'

1361
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,150
'I don't think so.

1362
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:41,200
When the door opens, the light from the corridor
comes in very brightly and wakes you up.'

1363
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:47,980
With words of thanks, Poirot brought the interview
to an end.

1364
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:57,510
'Well, he has been in America for a long time,'
said M. Bouc when Foscarelli had left the

1365
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,510
carriage.

1366
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:05,520
'He is Italian - Italians are good at lying
and love using knives.

1367
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,020
I don't like Italians.'

1368
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:14,670
'That is very clear,' smiled Poirot.

1369
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:19,800
'But there is no evidence against this man.

1370
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,890
Italians use knives, yes, but in a fight,
when

1371
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:27,300
they are angry.

1372
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:32,030
This murder was very carefully planned.'

1373
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:35,630
He picked up the last two passports.

1374
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:40,910
'Let us see Miss Mary Debenham next.'

1375
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:49,430
Miss Debenham entered the restaurant carriage
calmly, dressed in a little black suit.

1376
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:52,480
She sat down opposite Poirot.

1377
01:41:52,480 --> 01:42:02,950
'Your name is Mary Hermione Debenham, you
are English, and you are twenty-six years

1378
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:04,040
old?'

1379
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,230
began Poirot.

1380
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:07,320
'Yes.'

1381
01:42:07,320 --> 01:42:13,580
'Now, Miss Debenham, what can you tell us
about last night's events?'

1382
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:15,520
'Nothing, I'm afraid.

1383
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,040
I went to bed and slept.'

1384
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:24,410
Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.

1385
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:30,470
'You are travelling from Baghdad to London,
I believe.'

1386
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:31,510
'Yes.'

1387
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:34,520
'What have you been doing in Baghdad?'

1388
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:40,670
'I have been working as governess to two children.'

1389
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:43,400
'Have you ever been to America?'

1390
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,400
'America?

1391
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,380
No, never.'

1392
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:54,840
'What is your opinion of the lady who shares
your compartment - Miss Ohlsson?'

1393
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:59,100
'She seems a pleasant, simple person.'

1394
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:04,840
'What colour is her dressing gown?'

1395
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,670
Mary Debenham looked surprised.

1396
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:09,290
'A brown colour.'

1397
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:14,200
'And I noticed your dressing gown on the train
to Istanbul.

1398
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:18,700
It is purple, I believe.'

1399
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,200
'Yes, that is right.'

1400
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:25,900
'Have you got any other dressing gown, Miss
Debenham?

1401
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,740
A red one, for example?'

1402
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:32,710
'No, that is not mine.'

1403
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:38,250
The detective moved forward quickly, like
a cat jumping on a mouse.

1404
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:40,130
'Not yours?

1405
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:48,570
So you know that the red dressing gown belongs
to someone else!

1406
01:43:48,570 --> 01:43:49,680
Whose is it?'

1407
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,160
The girl moved back, a little shocked.

1408
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,680
'I don't know,' she replied.

1409
01:43:54,680 --> 01:44:01,360
'I saw someone wearing it last night in the
corridor, but I didn't see her face.'

1410
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,260
'Was she tall or short?

1411
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,880
Fair or dark?'

1412
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:13,230
She had a hat on, so I couldn't see her hair.

1413
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:18,820
But she was tall and thin.

1414
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,930
It was a Chinese-style dressing gown.'

1415
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:22,280
Yes, that's right, Chinese.'

1416
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:24,300
The detective was silent for a minute.

1417
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,880
Then he said to himself, 'I cannot understand.

1418
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:33,170
None of this makes sense.'

1419
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:40,550
Looking up, he said to Miss Debenham, 'We
do not need you any more.

1420
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,430
You can go.'

1421
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:50,760
When she had left, M. Bouc stared at his friend
with a confused look on his face.

1422
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:57,390
'You think she is guilty, don't you?' he said
slowly.

1423
01:44:57,390 --> 01:44:58,390
'But why?

1424
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:12,120
She seems a very pleasant young lady - the
last person in the world to be a murderer.'

1425
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,120
'I agree,' said Constantine.

1426
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,450
'She is a very calm person.

1427
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:17,690
She would not murder her enemy.

1428
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,820
She would take him to court.'

1429
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:27,690
'There is an unemotional, intelligent brain
behind this crime.

1430
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:33,940
Miss Debenham fits the description of the
murderer exactly.'

1431
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:36,540
M. Bouc shook his head.

1432
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:39,020
'You are wrong, my friend.

1433
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:43,830
That young woman is not a criminal.'

1434
01:45:43,830 --> 01:45:47,180
'I have another reason to think carefully
about her.

1435
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:53,960
I have not yet told you what I heard during
my journey to Istanbul.'

1436
01:45:53,960 --> 01:46:00,310
He told the two men about Miss Debenham's
words to Colonel Arbuthnot on the platform

1437
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,840
at Konya.

1438
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:06,090
M. Bouc repeated the words thoughtfully.

1439
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:08,210
'"Not now.

1440
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:10,440
When it's all over.

1441
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,960
When it's behind us."

1442
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,050
That is certainly strange.

1443
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:21,460
It suggests that she and the Colonel are both
responsible.'

1444
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:29,420
'Yes, but there are other people who tell
us that they could not be the murderers.

1445
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:38,330
The stories of the Swedish woman and Mr MacQueen
seem to prove that they are both innocent.

1446
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:42,250
No, that solution does not work.

1447
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:51,430
Ah well,' continued the detective, picking
up the last passport, 'let us see our last

1448
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:59,940
passenger - Princess Dragomiroff's German
maid, Hildegarde Schmidt.'

1449
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:08,520
When the maid entered, Poirot asked her gently,
in German, about her movements the night before.

1450
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:14,270
'I do not know anything, Monsieur,' she said.

1451
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:18,480
'Your employer sent for you last night, I
believe.

1452
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,570
Do you remember the time?'

1453
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:21,780
'No, Monsieur.

1454
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:26,230
I was asleep when the conductor called me.'

1455
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:31,130
'Do you often go to your employer's room at
night?'

1456
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:35,030
'It is not unusual, Monsieur.

1457
01:47:35,030 --> 01:47:37,510
She does not sleep well.'

1458
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:43,220
'And did you put on your dressing gown to
go to her compartment?'

1459
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:46,050
'That would not be right, Monsieur!

1460
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:48,310
I put on my day clothes.'

1461
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:56,210
'Although it is a very nice dressing gown
- red, I think?'

1462
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,680
She stared at him.

1463
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,590
'It is dark blue, Monsieur!'

1464
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:02,590
'Ah!

1465
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:03,940
My mistake!

1466
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:08,150
So, you went to the Princess's compartment.

1467
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:09,480
What did you do there?'

1468
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,820
'I read to her.

1469
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:18,970
Then I returned to my own compartment to get
her an extra blanket, and finally went back

1470
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:20,430
to bed.'

1471
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:25,430
'Do you know what time that was?'

1472
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:27,790
'No, Monsieur.'

1473
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:31,290
'And you met no one in the corridor?'

1474
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:34,390
'No, Monsieur.

1475
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:37,050
There was nobody there except the conductor.

1476
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:39,030
Everyone was asleep.'

1477
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,190
'But you did see the conductor.

1478
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:43,970
What was he doing?'

1479
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:48,730
'He came out of one of the compartments, Monsieur.'

1480
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:52,210
M. Bouc moved forward.

1481
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:56,380
'Which one,' he asked urgently.

1482
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:57,840
The maid looked frightened.

1483
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,630
'One of the middle ones, Monsieur.

1484
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:03,600
Two or three doors from the Princess's.'

1485
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,470
'Please tell us exactly what happened.'

1486
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:14,290
'He almost ran into me as I was taking the
blanket to the Princess.

1487
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:18,820
Then he apologised and continued down the
corridor.

1488
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:25,320
A bell began ringing, but I do not think he
answered it.'

1489
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:29,750
'This poor conductor,' said Poirot.

1490
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,570
'He had a busy night.

1491
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,660
First he had to wake you.

1492
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:38,190
Then there was that bell.'

1493
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:44,600
'He was not the conductor who woke me, Monsieur.

1494
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,150
It was another one.'

1495
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:47,150
'Another one?

1496
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:50,340
Would you recognise him if you saw him again?'

1497
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:54,790
'I think so, Monsieur.'

1498
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:58,150
Poirot whispered something in M. Bouc's ear.

1499
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:01,230
M. Bouc went to the door to give an order.

1500
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:04,610
'Have you ever been to America?'

1501
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:06,410
the detective continued.

1502
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:07,910
'Never, Monsieur.

1503
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:12,410
It must be a fine country.'

1504
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:16,670
He took a handkerchief from his pocket.

1505
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:18,990
'Is this yours?'

1506
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:24,330
There was a moment's silence as the woman
examined it.

1507
01:50:24,330 --> 01:50:27,620
Her face went a little red.

1508
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:32,060
'No, it is not mine,' she replied.

1509
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:38,170
'It has the letter H, you see - for Hildegarde.'

1510
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:44,130
'Really, it is not mine.

1511
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:48,660
This is an expensive handkerchief, Monsieur,
the handkerchief of a fine lady.'

1512
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:53,190
'You do not know which fine lady?'

1513
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:57,530
Poirot noticed that there was a slight pause
before she

1514
01:50:57,530 --> 01:50:59,540
answered, 'I?

1515
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:02,560
Oh, no, Monsieur.'

1516
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:09,610
M. Bouc now whispered in Poirot's ear.

1517
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:13,030
The detective said, 'The three conductors
are coming in, Mademoiselle.

1518
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:19,590
Please could you tell me which one almost
ran into you last night?'

1519
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,310
The three men entered.

1520
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:28,250
Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them and immediately
shook her head.

1521
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:30,780
'No, Monsieur.

1522
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:33,820
None of these is the man that I saw last night.

1523
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:37,040
These are all tall, big men.

1524
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:42,170
I saw a small, dark man with a little moustache.

1525
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:50,300
When he said "Excuse me", his voice was weak,
like a woman's.

1526
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:57,490
I remember him very well, Monsieur.'

1527
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,861
CHAPTER SIX

1528
01:51:59,861 --> 01:52:03,480
The Sponge Bag

1529
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:12,230
'A small dark man with a high voice,' said
M. Bouc when the conductors and Hildegarde

1530
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:13,570
Schmidt had left the carriage.

1531
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:18,130
'That is the enemy that Ratchett described!

1532
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:21,400
But where is he now?

1533
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:27,860
He didn't leave the train, but he isn't on
the train either.'

1534
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:34,820
'Like you, I am very confused,' said Poirot.

1535
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:44,200
'In this situation, it is always best to return
to the facts that we can be sure about.

1536
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:53,440
'Fact one: Ratchett, or Cassetti, was murdered
in his bed last night, with twelve knife wounds

1537
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,960
in the chest.

1538
01:52:54,960 --> 01:53:00,360
Fact two: his watch had stopped at a quarter
past one -'

1539
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:06,710
'So that gives us a definite time for the
crime,' said M. Bouc.

1540
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:11,670
'Not necessarily,' said the detective.

1541
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:20,450
'It is possible that the murder happened earlier
or later than that time, and that the murderer

1542
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:24,740
has left us the watch as a false clue.

1543
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:32,630
There is also the information from Dr Constantine,
that at least two of the wounds were made

1544
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:36,070
some time after Ratchett was already dead.'

1545
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:43,460
'And what about the man in the conductor's
uniform?' asked M. Bouc.

1546
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,920
'He is fact three.'

1547
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,000
'Not so fast, my friend.

1548
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,880
We must first examine the evidence carefully.

1549
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:58,330
Hardman, the detective, spoke of this man.

1550
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:00,180
Should we believe him?

1551
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:06,420
I think we should, because his story - that
he was hired by Ratchett - could easily be

1552
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:11,230
disproved by a quick phone call to McNeil's
in New York.

1553
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:17,880
And we have other evidence that his story
is true, from Hildegarde Schmidt.

1554
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:27,950
Her description of the man in the conductor's
uniform matches Hardman's description exactly.

1555
01:54:27,950 --> 01:54:34,340
And there is also the button found in Mrs
Hubbard's compartment.

1556
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:41,140
So we have three separate pieces of evidence
for this man with the high voice.'

1557
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:49,800
'Yes, yes, my friend,' said M. Bouc impatiently.

1558
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:54,040
'We all agree that he exists.

1559
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:55,370
But where did he go?'

1560
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:57,500
'Perhaps he is two people.

1561
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:07,780
I mean, he is both himself - the small, dark
man feared by M. Ratchett - and a passenger

1562
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:16,160
on the train, looking so different that Ratchett
did not recognise him.'

1563
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:25,412
'But the men on the train are all tall,' said
M. Bouc, '- except the servant Masterman,

1564
01:55:25,412 --> 01:55:26,970
and he is unlikely to be our murderer.'

1565
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:33,780
'The man may actually be a woman,' said Poirot.

1566
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:36,850
'That would explain the high voice.'

1567
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:44,030
'But it would not explain the wounds that
did not bleed,' said Dr Constantine.

1568
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:46,980
'We must not forget those.'

1569
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:56,780
'I have forgotten nothing, Doctor, but I have
not yet found the solution that I am looking

1570
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:58,570
for.

1571
01:55:58,570 --> 01:56:06,260
Perhaps the woman in the red dressing gown,
seen by several passengers including me, is

1572
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:12,710
our second murderer - the one who made those
wounds, Doctor.

1573
01:56:12,710 --> 01:56:19,670
If we believe the female passengers, nobody
has a red dressing gown.

1574
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:22,860
So where is it now?

1575
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:29,690
And where is the conductor's uniform with
the missing button?'

1576
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:34,070
'Ah!' cried M. Bouc, jumping to his feet.

1577
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,210
'We must search all the passengers' luggage.'

1578
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:41,240
M. Poirot stood up too.

1579
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:47,460
'I can guess where you will find the uniform,'
he said.

1580
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:52,970
'It will almost certainly be in the compartment
of Hildegarde Schmidt.'

1581
01:56:52,970 --> 01:57:02,260
'How -' began M. Bouc, but he was interrupted
by screams from the corridor.

1582
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:06,030
The door flew open and Mrs Hubbard ran in.

1583
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:10,690
'It's too horrible!'

1584
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:11,940
she cried.

1585
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:15,990
'In my sponge bag.

1586
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:19,020
My sponge bag!

1587
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,720
A great knife - with blood all over it.'

1588
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:28,140
Then she suddenly fell forwards and dropped
heavily into the arms of M. Bouc.

1589
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:36,121
M. Bouc moved the woman to a chair, with her
head on the table, and followed Poirot out

1590
01:57:36,121 --> 01:57:37,320
of the door.

1591
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:41,240
Dr Constantine called for a waiter.

1592
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:48,100
'Keep her head like that,' he said, then hurried
after the other two.

1593
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:55,750
There was a crowd of people outside Mrs Hubbard's
compartment, wanting to see what the screams

1594
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:57,260
were about.

1595
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:02,010
Michel opened the door for the detective and
his two friends.

1596
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:05,550
'The knife is there, Monsieur.

1597
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:09,100
I have not touched it.'

1598
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:14,740
Hanging on the handle of the door into the
next compartment was a large sponge bag.

1599
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:21,170
Below it, on the floor, was a sharp knife,
covered in dried blood.

1600
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:25,430
Poirot picked it up carefully.

1601
01:58:25,430 --> 01:58:27,880
'What do you think, Doctor?

1602
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:32,200
Did this knife kill Ratchett?'

1603
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:36,220
Constantine's examination did not take long.

1604
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:37,750
'Yes.

1605
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:42,900
All the wounds on Ratchett's body could be
made with that knife.'

1606
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:50,640
'So,' said M. Bouc, 'the man passes through
this compartment on his way to the corridor.

1607
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:56,940
He notices the sponge bag and hides the knife
inside it.

1608
01:58:56,940 --> 01:59:04,500
Not even realising that he has woken Mrs Hubbard,
he quickly leaves.'

1609
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:11,650
'Yes, no doubt,' said Poirot, but his mind
was clearly on other matters.

1610
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:18,380
He was staring at a door bolt thirty centimetres
above the handle where the sponge bag was

1611
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,530
hanging.

1612
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:25,190
His thoughts were interrupted by the tearful
return of Mrs Hubbard.

1613
01:59:25,190 --> 01:59:30,810
'I'm not going to spend another night in this
compartment,' she said.

1614
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:38,050
'I wouldn't sleep in here again if you paid
me a million dollars.

1615
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:40,840
Oh, if my daughter knew -'

1616
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:47,800
Poirot said loudly, 'Your luggage will be
moved immediately, Madame.'

1617
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:51,190
Mrs Hubbard's crying stopped.

1618
01:59:51,190 --> 01:59:52,190
'Really?'

1619
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,590
she said.

1620
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:57,890
'Then I feel better already.'

1621
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:05,000
Poirot told Michel to move her luggage to
compartment number 12, in the next carriage.

1622
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:11,020
The detective then showed her to her new compartment
himself.

1623
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:12,890
She looked around happily.

1624
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:16,490
This is fine,' she said.

1625
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:23,290
'And it faces the other way, so it feels quite
different from my old compartment.

1626
02:00:23,290 --> 02:00:29,300
Oh, I still can't believe that there was a
murderer in there!'

1627
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:36,610
'The bolt on the door still confuses me, Madame,'
said Poirot.

1628
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:41,870
'You were in bed, so you couldn't see it?'

1629
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:45,400
'That's right, because the sponge bag was
there.'

1630
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:51,790
Poirot picked up the sponge bag and hung it
on the door handle.

1631
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:54,480
'I see,' he said.

1632
02:00:54,480 --> 02:01:02,970
'The bolt is just underneath the handle, so
it is hidden by the sponge bag.'

1633
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:04,390
'Exactly.

1634
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:08,270
But the Swedish lady said that it was bolted.'

1635
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:10,160
'She made a mistake, I suppose,' said Poirot.

1636
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:17,040
'Well, it was rather stupid of her, I think.'

1637
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:22,110
Mrs Hubbard began to worry about the delay
to the train.

1638
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:25,830
'I can't possibly get to my boat in time.

1639
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:28,300
This is just too terrible -'

1640
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:34,940
M. Poirot interrupted her before the tears
returned.

1641
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:37,890
'You have had a shock, Madame.

1642
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:40,190
Perhaps we should get you a cup of tea.'

1643
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:44,000
'A coffee would be better.

1644
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,820
Thank you.'

1645
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:53,960
As the coffee was brought to Mrs Hubbard,
Poirot asked for permission to search her

1646
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:55,340
luggage.

1647
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:59,310
She agreed willingly, but nothing of interest
was found.

1648
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:06,290
A search of Mr Hardman's compartment was no
more successful, but in Colonel Arbuthnot's

1649
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:12,100
luggage he discovered a packet of pipe cleaners
that were exactly the same as the one found

1650
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:15,610
at the crime scene.

1651
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:19,760
Poirot went next to the compartments of Count
and Countess Andrenyi.

1652
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:25,330
As he entered, the Count was sitting near
the door, reading a newspaper.

1653
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:28,940
His wife was curled up in a chair near the
window.

1654
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:31,880
It appeared that she had been asleep.

1655
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:35,710
A quick search followed.

1656
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:43,400
'Here is a label all wet on your suitcase,
Madame,' said Poirot as he lifted down a blue

1657
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,170
bag.

1658
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:51,750
She did not reply, but stayed curled on her
chair, showing no interest in the visitors.

1659
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:58,240
The next compartment was shared by Mary Debenham
and Greta Ohlsson.

1660
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:00,880
Poirot explained his purpose.

1661
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:08,980
'After we have examined your luggage, Miss
Ohlsson, perhaps you could visit Mrs Hubbard.

1662
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:14,550
We have moved her into the next carriage,
but she is still very upset.

1663
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:18,300
It might help her to talk to someone.'

1664
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:22,790
The kind Swede wanted to go and see Mrs Hubbard
immediately.

1665
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:28,050
She left her suitcase unlocked in the compartment
for Poirot's search.

1666
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:33,710
This was quickly done and the detective turned
to Miss Debenham.

1667
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,180
She was staring at him.

1668
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:39,890
'Why did you send Miss Ohlsson away?'

1669
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:40,960
she asked him.

1670
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:45,450
'To help the American woman,' he replied.

1671
02:03:45,450 --> 02:03:50,900
'A good excuse - but still an excuse.'

1672
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:51,900
She smiled.

1673
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:55,860
'You wanted to speak to me alone, didn't you?'

1674
02:03:55,860 --> 02:04:01,660
'I do not plan as carefully as you think,
Miss Debenham.'

1675
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:04,330
'Please - I am not stupid.

1676
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:11,110
For some reason, you have decided that I am
responsible for this horrible crime.'

1677
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:15,230
'You are imagining things.'

1678
02:04:15,230 --> 02:04:18,400
'No, I am not imagining things.

1679
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,800
Let's not waste time.

1680
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,380
Say what you want to say.'

1681
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:27,300
'As you wish, Mademoiselle.

1682
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:33,950
On the journey from Syria, we stopped at Konya
and I went for a walk on the platform.

1683
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:39,770
I heard you say to Colonel Arbuthnot, "Not
now.

1684
02:04:39,770 --> 02:04:41,580
When it's all over.

1685
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:44,590
When it's behind us."

1686
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:48,600
What did you mean by those words?'

1687
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:54,770
She said very quietly, 'Do you think I meant
- murder?'

1688
02:04:54,770 --> 02:05:00,030
'I am asking you what you meant.'

1689
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:03,360
She sat silently for a minute, lost in thought.

1690
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:09,540
Then she said, 'Those words had a meaning
that I cannot tell you, Monsieur.

1691
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:16,220
I can only promise you that I never saw this
man Ratchett in my life until I saw him on

1692
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:19,030
this train.'

1693
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:22,120
'You refuse to explain those words?'

1694
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,680
'I must, I'm afraid.

1695
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:27,280
There was something that I had to do -'

1696
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:31,530
'And now you have done it?'

1697
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:33,380
'What do you mean?'

1698
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:40,610
'There was a delay before we arrived in Istanbul.

1699
02:05:40,610 --> 02:05:44,239
You were very upset - you, who are always
so calm.

1700
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:46,030
You lost that calm.'

1701
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:50,920
'I did not want to miss my connection.'

1702
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:55,940
'But the Orient Express leaves Istanbul every
day of the week.

1703
02:05:55,940 --> 02:06:00,740
Missing the connection meant a delay of only
twenty- four hours.

1704
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:07,670
On this train, again we have had a delay - a
more serious delay.

1705
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:11,500
But this time your behaviour is very different.

1706
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,860
You are not impatient at all.

1707
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:17,440
You are quite calm.'

1708
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:21,410
Miss Debenham's face was red.

1709
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:24,970
She was not smiling now.

1710
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:27,070
'You do not answer, Mademoiselle?'

1711
02:06:27,070 --> 02:06:28,210
'I'm sorry.

1712
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:32,770
What do you want me to tell you?'

1713
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:37,420
For the first time she showed signs of losing
her temper.

1714
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:45,200
'Tell me why your behaviour is so different.'

1715
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,340
'I cannot tell you.

1716
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:50,550
There is nothing to explain.'

1717
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:52,490
'It does not matter,' said Hercule Poirot.

1718
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,360
'I will find out.'

1719
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,460
He turned and left the compartment.

1720
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:03,550
In the next compartment, Hildegarde Schmidt
was waiting for them.

1721
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:09,720
After looking through her luggage, Poirot
turned to M. Bouc.

1722
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:11,410
'You remember what I said?

1723
02:07:11,410 --> 02:07:14,230
Look here a moment.'

1724
02:07:14,230 --> 02:07:21,610
There was a brown conductor's uniform untidily
placed inside the maid's suitcase.

1725
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:24,620
The maid suddenly looked frightened.

1726
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:27,690
'That is not mine!'

1727
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:28,690
she cried.

1728
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:34,510
'I have not looked in that case since we left
Istanbul.'

1729
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:39,800
Poirot touched her arm gently and said, 'Do
not worry.

1730
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,290
We believe you.

1731
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:47,310
The man in this uniform had hoped not to be
seen.

1732
02:07:47,310 --> 02:07:54,230
After he ran into you in the corridor, he
needed to hide his uniform.

1733
02:07:54,230 --> 02:08:00,110
He saw that the door to your compartment was
open, so he quickly took it off and threw

1734
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:03,070
it on top of your suitcase.'

1735
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:06,190
He held up the jacket.

1736
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:09,770
A button, the third down, was missing.

1737
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:12,860
In the pocket was a conductor's key.

1738
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:21,270
'With that, he could lock and unlock any door
in the carriage,' cried M. Bouc.

1739
02:08:21,270 --> 02:08:27,130
'Now we must find the red dressing gown,'
said Poirot.

1740
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:35,490
The next compartment was Mr MacQueen's, and
after that Masterman's and the Italian's.

1741
02:08:35,490 --> 02:08:42,580
Nothing of interest was found in their luggage,
and there were no more compartments to search.

1742
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:46,970
'What shall we do now?' asked M. Bouc.

1743
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:49,590
'We have collected all the evidence that we
can.

1744
02:08:49,590 --> 02:08:54,420
We will go now to the restaurant carriage
and think.

1745
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:57,590
But I will need cigarettes.

1746
02:08:57,590 --> 02:09:02,440
I will meet you there in a few moments.'

1747
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:06,260
Poirot returned to his own compartment to
get cigarettes from his suitcase.

1748
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:10,990
As he opened the case, he sat down suddenly
and stared.

1749
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:21,010
Placed tidily among his things was a red dressing
gown with a Chinese picture on the back.

1750
02:09:21,010 --> 02:09:23,250
CHAPTER SEVEN

1751
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:27,500
Which of Them?

1752
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:35,750
M. Bouc and Dr Constantine were talking together
when Poirot entered the restaurant carriage.

1753
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:43,670
'Well,' said M. Bouc, 'this case makes no
sense at all.'

1754
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:46,620
'I agree,' said the doctor.

1755
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:48,900
Poirot lit a cigarette.

1756
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:53,660
'But the evidence of the passengers was very
helpful.'

1757
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:57,760
'I thought it told us nothing!'

1758
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,760
cried Bouc.

1759
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:01,170
'What did I miss?'

1760
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:04,710
'Take young MacQueen, for example.

1761
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:11,480
He told us that his employer, M. Ratchett,
spoke no languages except English.

1762
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:18,970
Last night the conductor heard someone in
M. Ratchett's compartment call out, "Ce n'est

1763
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:21,800
rien.Je me suis from pc."

1764
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:24,170
That was not M. Ratchett.'

1765
02:10:24,170 --> 02:10:26,240
'It is true!'

1766
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:28,310
cried Constantine excitedly.

1767
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:34,170
'That is why you didn't want to accept the
evidence of the watch.

1768
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:41,020
Those words came from the compartment at twenty-three
minutes to one.

1769
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:43,210
Ratchett was already dead -'

1770
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:49,790
'And it was his murderer speaking,' finished
M. Bouc.

1771
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:54,330
'You go too fast, my friends,' said Poirot.

1772
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:58,462
'We have no evidence that Ratchett was dead
at that time.'

1773
02:10:58,462 --> 02:11:02,420
'There was the cry that woke you.'

1774
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:05,520
'Yes, that is true.'

1775
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:13,160
'In one way,' said M. Bouc, 'this discovery
does not change things very much.

1776
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:18,770
The murderer killed Ratchett half an hour
earlier than we first thought.

1777
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:26,260
He stayed in the compartment for half an hour,
changed the watch hands to a quarter past

1778
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:31,960
one and left through Mrs Hubbard's compartment.'

1779
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:37,620
'But imagine that you are the murderer,' said
Poirot.

1780
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:44,260
'Wouldn't you change the watch to a time when
your presence in Ratchett's compartment was

1781
02:11:44,260 --> 02:11:45,260
impossible?

1782
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:53,380
You wouldn't move the hands to the exact time
that you left the crime scene.'

1783
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:57,790
'True,' said Dr Constantine, a little confused.

1784
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:05,230
'Perhaps it was the second murderer who changed
the watch,' said M. Bouc.

1785
02:12:05,230 --> 02:12:09,240
'The woman in the red dressing gown.'

1786
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:15,320
'It was too dark for her to see that the man
was already dead, but she managed to find

1787
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:25,550
a watch in Ratchett's pyjama pocket and change
the time blindly!' said Poirot in disbelief.

1788
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:27,920
M. Bouc gave him a cold stare.

1789
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:33,310
'And what is your explanation, my friend?'

1790
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:39,500
'At the moment I have none that makes sense,'
replied Poirot.

1791
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:47,080
'But it is time to close our eyes and think.

1792
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:51,730
One or more of the passengers killed Ratchett.

1793
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:55,870
Which of them?'

1794
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:58,880
For a quarter of an hour, no one spoke.

1795
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:01,570
Poirot appeared to be asleep.

1796
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:10,570
Then suddenly his eyes opened and he said
to himself, 'But why not?

1797
02:13:10,570 --> 02:13:14,280
If so - well, that would explain everything.'

1798
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:27,740
He turned to the other men in the carriage
and asked, 'Have you had any useful thoughts?'

1799
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:34,340
'Thoughts, yes, but nothing very useful,'
said the doctor.

1800
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,300
M. Bouc agreed.

1801
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:44,550
'I myself have thought of an explanation that
would cover all the facts of the case.

1802
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:51,140
I am not yet sure that it is the correct one,
but I will soon find out.

1803
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:56,170
Before that, let us discuss some points of
interest.

1804
02:13:56,170 --> 02:14:02,340
Firstly, an ink spot on a Hungarian passport.'

1805
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:07,950
M. Bouc looked at the passport of Count and
Countess Andrenyi.

1806
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:12,640
'Is this the spot that you mean?' he asked.

1807
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:13,700
'Yes.

1808
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:17,440
It seems to be fresh ink.

1809
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:20,150
You notice where it is?'

1810
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:24,340
'At the beginning of the Countess's name.

1811
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:25,540
But what -?'

1812
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:29,780
'Now, let us think back to the handkerchief.

1813
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:35,930
It is a very expensive thing, hand-made in
Paris.

1814
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:45,130
It has an H on it, but it is not something
that unfashionable Mrs Hubbard would buy,

1815
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:51,420
and it is certainly not the handkerchief of
Hildegarde, the lady's maid.

1816
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:57,500
There are only two women on the train who
might own a handkerchief like this.

1817
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:00,670
They are Princess Dragomiroff -'

1818
02:15:00,670 --> 02:15:08,840
'Whose first name is Natalia,' interrupted
M. Bouc and Countess Andrenyi.

1819
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:13,250
Now, I wonder about that ink spot.

1820
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:22,330
Perhaps it was just an accident, but perhaps
it is hiding a letter.

1821
02:15:22,330 --> 02:15:30,070
Perhaps the Countess's name is not Elena but
Helena.'

1822
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:31,360
'Helena!'

1823
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:32,810
cried M. Bouc.

1824
02:15:32,810 --> 02:15:35,040
'That is an idea.'

1825
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:39,150
'And there is something to support that idea
too.

1826
02:15:39,150 --> 02:15:45,380
One of the labels on the Countess's luggage
was slightly wet.

1827
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:48,960
Perhaps there too a change to her name was
made.'

1828
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:54,710
'I am starting to believe you,' said M. Bouc.

1829
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:58,130
'But the Countess Andrenyi, a murderer?

1830
02:15:58,130 --> 02:16:02,960
It is so unlikely.'

1831
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:09,070
'Now, let us imagine last night without the
snow on the line.

1832
02:16:09,070 --> 02:16:10,580
What happens?

1833
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:16,790
Well, the murder is discovered as the train
enters Italy.

1834
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:22,860
The man in conductor's uniform is seen earlier-just
before one o'clock.

1835
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:29,500
We find a button in Mrs Hubbard's compartment
and the uniform in the toilets.

1836
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:33,780
We read the threatening letters produced by
MacQueen.

1837
02:16:33,780 --> 02:16:40,219
We decide that the murderer got off the train
at Brod, where it stopped at 00.58.'

1838
02:16:40,219 --> 02:16:42,600
'You mean -?'

1839
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:50,139
'I mean that the murder was planned to seem
like the work of someone from the outside,

1840
02:16:50,139 --> 02:16:52,990
not a passenger.

1841
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:57,139
But the snow changed everything.

1842
02:16:57,139 --> 02:17:04,360
It made it impossible to believe that the
murderer had got off the train.'

1843
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:10,610
'And where does the handkerchief fit in?'

1844
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:12,230
'Be patient, my friend.

1845
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:20,240
Now, we return to the burnt note which included
the words Daisy Armstrong.

1846
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:23,410
The murderer did not want us to read that
letter.

1847
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:25,170
Why not?

1848
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:30,340
There can be only one reason.

1849
02:17:30,340 --> 02:17:35,510
Someone on this train must be very closely
connected to the Armstrong family, and the

1850
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:39,670
note would make that person look guilty.

1851
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:44,010
I think that person is Countess Andrenyi.'

1852
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:50,110
'But what connection could she have with the
Armstrongs?'

1853
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:52,300
cried M. Bouc.

1854
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:59,670
'She says that she has never been to America.'

1855
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:03,980
'Yes, and she speaks only a little English,
and she has a very foreign appearance.

1856
02:18:03,980 --> 02:18:07,059
But this could all be an act.

1857
02:18:07,059 --> 02:18:13,260
I am guessing that she is Linda Arden's younger
daughter.

1858
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:18,170
Arden was not the actress's real surname.

1859
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:22,420
Perhaps she was really called Goldenberg,

1860
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:28,011
and the daughter met and married Count Andrenyi
while he was working in Washington.'

1861
02:18:28,011 --> 02:18:36,220
'But the 
Princess says that she married an Englishman.'

1862
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:41,620
'Princess Dragomiroff says that she cannot
remember the name of the daughter's husband.

1863
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:48,790
Is that likely, when the Princess and the
actress were such close friends?'

1864
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:53,110
One of the waiters interrupted them.

1865
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:58,650
'Excuse me, Monsieur Bouc, but should we serve
dinner now?'

1866
02:18:58,650 --> 02:19:00,820
M. Bouc looked at Poirot.

1867
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:07,530
'I think dinner would be most welcome,' said
the detective.

1868
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:14,720
At dinner, Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc
and the doctor.

1869
02:19:14,720 --> 02:19:19,809
The other passengers spoke little - even Mrs
Hubbard.

1870
02:19:19,809 --> 02:19:27,139
Poirot heard her say, 'I don't think I can
eat,' then watched as she ate everything that

1871
02:19:27,139 --> 02:19:28,849
was offered to her.

1872
02:19:28,849 --> 02:19:35,010
Poirot had asked the waiter to serve the Count
and Countess Andrenyi last.

1873
02:19:35,010 --> 02:19:39,389
All the other tables were empty when they
finished their meal.

1874
02:19:39,389 --> 02:19:44,730
As they stood up, Poirot stepped towards them.

1875
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:51,120
'You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame,'
he said, passing the Countess the small square

1876
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,680
of material.

1877
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:57,790
She looked at it quickly, then gave it back
to him.

1878
02:19:57,790 --> 02:20:03,170
'You are mistaken, Monsieur.

1879
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:04,171
That is not my handkerchief.'

1880
02:20:04,171 --> 02:20:10,040
'But it has a letter H on it - the first letter
of your name.'

1881
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:13,910
She said calmly, 'My name is Elena.

1882
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:17,210
The first letter is E.'

1883
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:20,470
'1 think not,' said Poirot.

1884
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:24,440
'Your name is Helena, not Elena.

1885
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:31,761
You are Helena Goldenberg, the sister of Mrs
Armstrong.'

1886
02:20:31,761 --> 02:20:36,790
There was complete silence for a minute or
two.

1887
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:40,490
Both the Count and the Countess had gone white.

1888
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:46,920
Poirot said, more gently, 'You cannot deny
it.

1889
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:47,920
We know.'

1890
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:54,120
'It is true, Monsieur,' said the Countess.

1891
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,100
Her voice had changed.

1892
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:59,620
It was, for the first time, American.

1893
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:05,110
'Why did you not tell me that this morning,
Madame?

1894
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:11,160
And why did you change the name on your passport?'

1895
02:21:11,160 --> 02:21:14,540
'I changed the name - it was not my wife,'
said the Count.

1896
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:20,340
'We had heard that a handkerchief with an
H on it had been discovered by the murdered

1897
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:22,260
man's body.'

1898
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:25,800
Helena spoke in an emotional voice.

1899
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:33,790
'The dead man murdered my niece, killed my
sister and caused the death of my sister's

1900
02:21:33,790 --> 02:21:39,880
husband - the three people that I loved best
in all the world.

1901
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:45,700
I had such a good reason for killing him.'

1902
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,810
'And did you kill him, Madame?'

1903
02:21:48,810 --> 02:21:53,370
'I promise you that I did not.'

1904
02:21:53,370 --> 02:21:55,070
she said quietly.

1905
02:21:55,070 --> 02:21:58,530
'It is true,' said the Count.

1906
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:02,351
'Helena never left her compartment last night.'

1907
02:22:02,351 --> 02:22:07,540
He paused, then continued, 'Imagine my position,
M. Poirot.

1908
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:16,711
I did not want my wife, who I knew was innocent,
to be taken to a police station, questioned,

1909
02:22:16,711 --> 02:22:20,790
perhaps even judged guilty and sent to prison.'

1910
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:29,130
'If I am going to believe you, you must help
me,' said Poirot.

1911
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,620
'Help you?'

1912
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:32,851
repeated the Countess.

1913
02:22:32,851 --> 02:22:33,851
'Yes.

1914
02:22:33,851 --> 02:22:45,160
The reason for the murder lies in the past
- in the deaths of your sister and her family.

1915
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:51,670
Take me back into the past so that I can find
the connection that explains everything.'

1916
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:56,381
'What can I tell you?

1917
02:22:56,381 --> 02:22:59,240
They are all dead.

1918
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:06,030
All dead - Robert, Sonia, dear little Daisy.'

1919
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:07,980
'Susanne too.

1920
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:11,500
What nationality was she, Madame?'

1921
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,381
'Poor Susanne.

1922
02:23:13,381 --> 02:23:16,200
She was French.'

1923
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:18,080
'Her surname?'

1924
02:23:18,080 --> 02:23:24,960
'It's terrible, but I can't remember - we
all just called her Susanne.

1925
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:28,050
A pretty, cheerful girl.

1926
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:29,061
She was so fond of Daisy.

1927
02:23:29,061 --> 02:23:33,900
She helped the nurse to look after her.'

1928
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:36,300
'Who was the nurse?'

1929
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:39,550
'Stengelberg was her name.

1930
02:23:39,550 --> 02:23:42,971
She too loved Daisy.'

1931
02:23:42,971 --> 02:23:50,380
'You yourself - you were a young girl at the
time - did you have a governess?'

1932
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:54,290
'Oh, yes, a very frightening woman.

1933
02:23:54,290 --> 02:24:01,780
She was English - no, Scottish - a big, red-haired
lady in her forties.'

1934
02:24:01,780 --> 02:24:05,181
'What was her name?'

1935
02:24:05,181 --> 02:24:07,630
'Miss Freebody.'

1936
02:24:07,630 --> 02:24:12,130
'And there was no one else living with you?'

1937
02:24:12,130 --> 02:24:13,841
'Only servants.'

1938
02:24:13,841 --> 02:24:19,780
'Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully
before you answer this question.

1939
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:28,630
Have you, since you were on this train, seen
anyone that you recognised?'

1940
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:30,370
She stared at him.

1941
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:31,590
'I?

1942
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:33,420
No, no one.'

1943
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:35,880
'What about Princess Dragomiroff?'

1944
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:39,561
'Oh, I know her, of course.

1945
02:24:39,561 --> 02:24:46,650
I thought you meant anyone - anyone from - from
that time.'

1946
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,650
'I did, Madame.

1947
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:51,980
Some years have passed, remember.

1948
02:24:51,980 --> 02:24:58,300
The person may look very different now.'

1949
02:24:58,300 --> 02:25:00,400
She thought for a moment.

1950
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:05,440
'No - I am sure - there is no one.'

1951
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:14,920
When the Count and Countess had left the carriage,
M. Bouc cried, 'Excellent work, my friend.

1952
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:17,771
I never for one moment

1953
02:25:17,771 --> 02:25:22,790
imagined that the Countess could be our murderer.'

1954
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:29,480
'So you feel sure that she is guilty?' asked
M. Poirot.

1955
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:30,480
'Yes.

1956
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:35,410
The handkerchief proves it,' said M. Bouc
confidently.

1957
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:40,440
'Oh, I am not sure about the handkerchief.

1958
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:46,521
There is another person who could be its owner,
remember.

1959
02:25:46,521 --> 02:25:47,650
I -'

1960
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:54,290
He stopped suddenly as Princess Dragomiroff
entered the restaurant carriage.

1961
02:25:54,290 --> 02:26:03,061
She walked towards Poirot and said, 'I believe,
Monsieur, that you have a handkerchief of

1962
02:26:03,061 --> 02:26:04,061
mine.'

1963
02:26:04,061 --> 02:26:05,061
'Is this it, Madame?'

1964
02:26:05,061 --> 02:26:08,630
He showed her the one found in Ratchett's
compartment.

1965
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:09,630
'That is it.

1966
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:13,560
It has a letter N in the corner, for my name
Natalia.'

1967
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:24,900
'But, Madame, it has the letter H, not N,'
said M. Bouc.

1968
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,950
She gave him a cold stare.

1969
02:26:26,950 --> 02:26:33,271
'My handkerchiefs always have Russian letters
on them.

1970
02:26:33,271 --> 02:26:37,210
H is N in Russian.'

1971
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:43,100
There was something about this old lady that
made M. Bouc feel very foolish.

1972
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:51,030
'You did not tell us that this handkerchief
was yours when we questioned you this morning,'

1973
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:52,030
he said.

1974
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:56,521
'You did not ask me,' said the Princess.

1975
02:26:56,521 --> 02:27:04,960
'Your next question, I suppose, will be - why
was my handkerchief lying by a murdered man's

1976
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:05,960
body?

1977
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:10,440
My reply to that is that I have no idea.'

1978
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:19,920
'Please excuse me, Madame, but why would we
believe you?' said Poirot.

1979
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:24,660
'You have already lied to us about Mrs Armstrong's
younger sister.'

1980
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:28,660
'And I would do the same again.

1981
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:31,511
Her mother was my friend.

1982
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:40,500
I believe in loyalty - to friends, to family
- above all else.'

1983
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:48,150
'And in the case of the handkerchief, perhaps
you are again lying to protect your friend's

1984
02:27:48,150 --> 02:27:49,841
daughter.'

1985
02:27:49,841 --> 02:27:55,440
'You think that the handkerchief is Helena's?'

1986
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:56,950
She smiled coldly.

1987
02:27:56,950 --> 02:28:01,860
'Well, it is easy to prove that it is mine.

1988
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:07,970
I will give you the address of the people
in Paris who made it for me.'

1989
02:28:07,970 --> 02:28:17,910
'Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this
handkerchief when we showed it to her this

1990
02:28:17,910 --> 02:28:19,110
morning?'

1991
02:28:19,110 --> 02:28:20,310
'Probably.

1992
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:22,190
She saw it and said nothing?

1993
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:29,170
Ah, well, then she too can be loyal.'

1994
02:28:29,170 --> 02:28:32,550
She stood up and walked out of the restaurant
carriage.

1995
02:28:32,550 --> 02:28:38,921
'But the Princess cannot be our murderer,'
said Dr Constantine.

1996
02:28:38,921 --> 02:28:43,420
'She doesn't have the strength to make the
deepest wounds.

1997
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:45,680
Her arms are very weak.'

1998
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:50,131
'But the smaller wounds?'

1999
02:28:50,131 --> 02:28:55,130
'Yes, those could be her work, I suppose.'

2000
02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:56,710
M. Bouc shook his head.

2001
02:28:56,710 --> 02:28:59,960
'Lies - and more lies.

2002
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:06,830
I cannot believe how many lies we were told
this morning!'

2003
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:12,920
'There are many more lies to uncover,' said
Poirot cheerfully.

2004
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:18,930
'I just need to make some more lucky guesses.'

2005
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:23,280
CHAPTER EIGHT

2006
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:27,630
Two Solutions

2007
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:32,540
Colonel Arbuthnot was called again to the
restaurant carriage.

2008
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:38,610
He came in, clearly annoyed, and said, 'Well?'

2009
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:44,570
'Firstly, I would like to show you a pipe
cleaner.'

2010
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:46,000
Poirot held it up.

2011
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,490
'Is it one of yours?'

2012
02:29:48,490 --> 02:29:50,460
'I don't know.

2013
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:55,720
I don't put a private mark on them!'

2014
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:58,511
'You are the only passenger who smokes a pipe.

2015
02:29:58,511 --> 02:30:04,900
This pipe cleaner was found by the body of
the murdered man.

2016
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:11,860
Can you tell us, Colonel, how it got there?'

2017
02:30:11,860 --> 02:30:14,051
Colonel Arbuthnot looked surprised.

2018
02:30:14,051 --> 02:30:17,780
'I don't know,' he said.

2019
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:23,900
'I can only tell you that I didn't drop it
there myself.'

2020
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:24,900
'Did you murder Mr Ratchett?'

2021
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,040
'I never even spoke to the man.

2022
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:34,410
Although, if I was the murderer, I wouldn't
tell you, would I?'

2023
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:36,631
'Oh well.

2024
02:30:36,631 --> 02:30:38,210
It doesn't matter.'

2025
02:30:38,210 --> 02:30:42,800
Again, the Colonel looked surprised.

2026
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:50,091
'I really wanted to see you about something
else,' continued Poirot.

2027
02:30:50,091 --> 02:30:59,021
'Miss Debenham has told you that I heard her
talking to you on the platform at Konya?'

2028
02:30:59,021 --> 02:31:00,550
Arbuthnot did not reply.

2029
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:04,470
'She said, "Not now.

2030
02:31:04,470 --> 02:31:06,280
When it's all over.

2031
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:08,580
When it's behind us."

2032
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:12,341
Do you know what those words meant?'

2033
02:31:12,341 --> 02:31:17,140
'I must refuse to answer that question.'

2034
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:21,950
'You will not tell a lady's secrets?'

2035
02:31:21,950 --> 02:31:22,950
'Exactly.'

2036
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:28,271
'Even when that lady is likely to be guilty
of murder?'

2037
02:31:28,271 --> 02:31:29,450
'That is crazy.

2038
02:31:29,450 --> 02:31:33,590
Miss Debenham is not a murderer.'

2039
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:42,210
'Miss Debenham was the Armstrongs' governess
at the time that Daisy was kidnapped,' said

2040
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:43,460
Poirot.

2041
02:31:43,460 --> 02:31:47,110
There was a minute's silence.

2042
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:53,610
'You see, we know more than you think,' continued
Poirot.

2043
02:31:53,610 --> 02:32:01,620
'If Miss Debenham is innocent, why did she
say that she had never been to America?'

2044
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:03,690
The Colonel coughed.

2045
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:06,850
'Perhaps you are mistaken.'

2046
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:10,810
'No, I am not mistaken.

2047
02:32:10,810 --> 02:32:16,340
Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?'

2048
02:32:16,340 --> 02:32:18,032
'I suggest that you ask her.

2049
02:32:18,032 --> 02:32:20,000
I still think that you are wrong.'

2050
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,890
Poirot called to one of the waiters.

2051
02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:30,630
'Go and ask the English lady in number 11
to come here, please.'

2052
02:32:30,630 --> 02:32:36,720
The four men sat in silence until Miss Debenham
had entered the carriage.

2053
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:41,070
Her head was thrown back bravely.

2054
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:42,730
She looked very beautiful.

2055
02:32:42,730 --> 02:32:48,521
Her eyes went to Arbuthnot for a moment - just
a moment.

2056
02:32:48,521 --> 02:32:54,040
Then she said to Poirot, 'You wished to see
me?'

2057
02:32:54,040 --> 02:33:02,450
'I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you
told us that you had never been in America.

2058
02:33:02,450 --> 02:33:08,450
We now know that you were living in the Armstrongs'
house when Daisy was kidnapped.'

2059
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:14,760
Her face changed for a second, then returned
to its usual calm.

2060
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:21,391
'The reason for my lie is easy to explain,'
she said with a smile.

2061
02:33:21,391 --> 02:33:23,120
'I have to work.

2062
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:29,670
Do you know how hard it is to get and keep
a good job as a governess?

2063
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:36,131
If my name were connected with this crime,
if my photograph were in the English newspapers,

2064
02:33:36,131 --> 02:33:38,131
my reputation would be ruined.

2065
02:33:38,131 --> 02:33:42,261
I would never work again.'

2066
02:33:42,261 --> 02:33:46,480
'But if you were not guilty, there would be
no problem.'

2067
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:55,900
'People remember names and faces - they do
not remember who was guilty and who was innocent.'

2068
02:33:55,900 --> 02:34:00,730
'It is always better to be honest, Mademoiselle.

2069
02:34:00,730 --> 02:34:09,150
And you also kept secret the fact that Countess
Andrenyi is Mrs Armstrong's younger sister.'

2070
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:11,080
'Countess Andrenyi?

2071
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:12,080
Really?'

2072
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:15,910
She shook her head.

2073
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:21,840
'It may seem unlikely, but I honestly didn't
recognise her.

2074
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:27,840
Three years ago, when I last saw her, she
was an American schoolgirl.

2075
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:30,490
She looks so different!

2076
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:36,061
It is true that, when I saw her, her face
looked familiar.

2077
02:34:36,061 --> 02:34:38,940
But I couldn't think who she was.

2078
02:34:38,940 --> 02:34:42,190
After that, I didn't really notice her.

2079
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:45,170
I had my own worries.'

2080
02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:51,920
'You will not tell me your secret?' asked
Poirot gently.

2081
02:34:51,920 --> 02:35:00,670
She replied very quietly, 'I can't - I can't.'

2082
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:05,300
Suddenly her face was in her hands and she
was crying.

2083
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:07,330
She seemed heartbroken.

2084
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:12,561
The Colonel jumped up and stood uncomfortably
beside her.

2085
02:35:12,561 --> 02:35:20,360
He shouted at Poirot, 'I'll break every bone
in your body!'

2086
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,360
'Monsieur!'

2087
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:23,200
cried M. Bouc.

2088
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,090
Arbuthnot was now talking to the girl.

2089
02:35:26,090 --> 02:35:29,380
'Mary, please -'

2090
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:30,681
She jumped up.

2091
02:35:30,681 --> 02:35:33,490
'It's nothing,' she said.

2092
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:35,070
'I'm fine.

2093
02:35:35,070 --> 02:35:37,274
You don't need me any more, do you, M. Poirot?

2094
02:35:37,274 --> 02:35:43,721
If you do, please come and find me.

2095
02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:47,400
Oh, what a fool I'm making of myself!'

2096
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:53,290
She hurried out of the carriage, followed
by Arbuthnot.

2097
02:35:53,290 --> 02:36:03,771
'Well, my friend,' smiled M. Bouc at Poirot,
'another excellent guess!'

2098
02:36:03,771 --> 02:36:10,510
'How do you do it?' asked Dr Constantine in
admiration.

2099
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:15,620
'This time it was easy.

2100
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:19,040
Countess Andrenyi almost told me.'

2101
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,040
'What?!'

2102
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:28,590
'When I asked her governess's name, she said
Freebody.

2103
02:36:28,590 --> 02:36:34,970
You may not know, gentlemen, but there used
to be a shop in London called Debenham and

2104
02:36:34,970 --> 02:36:35,970
Freebody.

2105
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:43,350
With the name Debenham running through her
head, Freebody was the first name that the

2106
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:44,800
Countess could think of.

2107
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:45,800
I understood immediately, of course.'

2108
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:46,800
'Nothing would surprise me now,' said M. Bouc.

2109
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:51,230
'Even if everybody on the train proved to
be friends of the Armstrongs!'

2110
02:36:51,230 --> 02:37:07,880
'It is certainly a most surprising case,'
said Dr Constantine?

2111
02:37:07,880 --> 02:37:16,380
'Now, let us see your Italian, M. Bouc,' said
Poirot.

2112
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:19,670
He asked the waiter to call Foscarelli to
the restaurant carriage.

2113
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:24,551
The big Italian soon arrived, looking very
nervous.

2114
02:37:24,551 --> 02:37:25,960
'What do you want?' he said.

2115
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:31,450
'I have told you everything that I know.'

2116
02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:38,890
'But now we want the true story,' said Poirot.

2117
02:37:38,890 --> 02:37:46,190
'We already know it, but it will be better
for you if you tell us yourself'

2118
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:51,500
'You sound like the American police,' he said
angrily.

2119
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:59,360
' "Be honest with us," they say, "and the
judges will be kind to you."'

2120
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:00,360
'Ah!

2121
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:04,430
You have had experience of the New York police?'

2122
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:06,420
'No, no, never.

2123
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:15,561
They could not prove anything against me - although
they tried hard enough.'

2124
02:38:15,561 --> 02:38:22,790
'That was in the Armstrong case, wasn't it?'
said Poirot quietly.

2125
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:28,010
'You drove their cars for them?'

2126
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:30,061
His eyes met the Italian's.

2127
02:38:30,061 --> 02:38:31,061
'If you already know, why ask me?'

2128
02:38:31,061 --> 02:38:32,061
the Italian said.

2129
02:38:32,061 --> 02:38:37,040
'Why did you lie this morning?'

2130
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:51,250
'For business reasons, and because I do not
want to be questioned by the Yugoslav police.

2131
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:52,851
They hate Italians.

2132
02:38:52,851 --> 02:38:56,590
They would just throw me in prison.'

2133
02:38:56,590 --> 02:38:58,970
'Perhaps you deserve to be thrown in prison.'

2134
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:04,160
'No, no, I didn't murder that man.

2135
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:09,340
The long-faced Englishman can tell you that.'

2136
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:11,721
'Very good,' said Poirot.

2137
02:39:11,721 --> 02:39:14,200
'You can go.'

2138
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:18,340
'That man was a pig!'

2139
02:39:18,340 --> 02:39:20,640
cried Foscarelli as he left the carriage.

2140
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:23,431
There were tears in his eyes.

2141
02:39:23,431 --> 02:39:27,820
'Little Daisy - what a lovely child!

2142
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:32,950
She loved to play in my car.

2143
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:38,080
All the servants thought she was wonderful.'

2144
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:40,341
Next Poirot called Greta Ohlsson.

2145
02:39:40,341 --> 02:39:47,070
She soon arrived, in tears, and fell back
into the seat facing the detective.

2146
02:39:47,070 --> 02:39:53,181
'Do not upset yourself, Mademoiselle,' Poirot
said gently.

2147
02:39:53,181 --> 02:40:00,280
'You were the nurse who looked after little
Daisy Armstrong?'

2148
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:05,551
'It is true,' cried the unhappy woman.

2149
02:40:05,551 --> 02:40:12,001
'Ah, she was a sweet, kind-hearted little
girl.'

2150
02:40:12,001 --> 02:40:13,001
For a moment she could not continue.

2151
02:40:13,001 --> 02:40:21,710
'I was wrong not to tell you this morning,
but I was afraid - afraid.

2152
02:40:21,710 --> 02:40:35,440
I was so happy that the evil man was dead,
that he could not kill any more little children.'

2153
02:40:35,440 --> 02:40:40,510
Poirot touched her gently on the shoulder.

2154
02:40:40,510 --> 02:40:43,100
'I understand - I understand everything.

2155
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:50,250
I will ask you no more questions.'

2156
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:55,380
The Swedish lady moved slowly out of the carriage,
her eyes blind with tears.

2157
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:59,800
As she reached the door, she walked into a
man coming in.

2158
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:07,813
It was the manservant, Masterman.

2159
02:41:07,813 --> 02:41:14,780
'Excuse me, sir,' he said to Poirot in his
usual, unemotional voice.

2160
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:21,440
'I thought I should tell you immediately.

2161
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:23,430
I worked for Colonel Armstrong in the war,
sir, and afterwards in New York.

2162
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:25,470
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you earlier.'

2163
02:41:25,470 --> 02:41:26,470
He stopped.

2164
02:41:26,470 --> 02:41:29,010
Poirot stared at him.

2165
02:41:29,010 --> 02:41:31,580
'Is that all that you want to say?'

2166
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:32,900
'Yes, sir.'

2167
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:41,100
He paused; then, when Poirot did not speak,
he turned and left the carriage.

2168
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:47,030
'This is more unlikely than a murder mystery
novel!'

2169
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:48,780
cried Dr Constantine.

2170
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:50,920
M. Bouc agreed.

2171
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:59,900
'Of the twelve passengers, nine have got a
definite connection with the Armstrong case.'

2172
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:06,720
'Perhaps we can fit them all into our little
collection,' said Poirot, smiling.

2173
02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:14,130
'Maybe they are - I don't know-the Armstrongs'
gardener, housekeeper and cook.'

2174
02:42:14,130 --> 02:42:20,870
'That would be too much to believe,' said
M. Bouc.

2175
02:42:20,870 --> 02:42:24,570
'They cannot all be connected.'

2176
02:42:24,570 --> 02:42:26,221
Poirot looked at him.

2177
02:42:26,221 --> 02:42:30,471
'You do not understand,' he said.

2178
02:42:30,471 --> 02:42:34,391
'You do not understand at all.'

2179
02:42:34,391 --> 02:42:37,660
'Do you?' asked M. Bouc.

2180
02:42:37,660 --> 02:42:42,290
'Do you know who killed Ratchett?'

2181
02:42:42,290 --> 02:42:46,070
'Oh, yes,' Poirot said.

2182
02:42:46,070 --> 02:42:50,720
'I have known for some time.'

2183
02:42:50,720 --> 02:42:53,801
Poirot was silent for a minute.

2184
02:42:53,801 --> 02:42:57,190
Then he said, 'M. Bouc, could

2185
02:42:57,190 --> 02:43:01,410
you please call everyone here.

2186
02:43:01,410 --> 02:43:06,420
There are two possible solutions to this case.

2187
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:10,290
I want to explain them both to you all.'

2188
02:43:10,290 --> 02:43:18,980
The passengers crowded into the restaurant
carriage and took their seats at the tables.

2189
02:43:18,980 --> 02:43:21,570
They all looked nervous.

2190
02:43:21,570 --> 02:43:27,050
The conductor, Michel, asked M. Poirot if
he could stay.

2191
02:43:27,050 --> 02:43:32,050
'Of course, Michel,' the detective replied.

2192
02:43:32,050 --> 02:43:37,480
He stood up and gave a little cough.

2193
02:43:37,480 --> 02:43:47,220
'Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to find
out who murdered Samuel Edward Ratchett - also

2194
02:43:47,220 --> 02:43:49,960
known as Cassetti.

2195
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:54,330
There are two possible solutions to the crime.

2196
02:43:54,330 --> 02:44:03,840
I will explain both solutions, and ask M.
Bouc and Dr Constantine here to judge which

2197
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:06,301
is the right one.

2198
02:44:06,301 --> 02:44:12,681
'Mr Ratchett died last night between midnight
and two in the morning.

2199
02:44:12,681 --> 02:44:20,190
At half an hour after midnight, the train
stopped because of the thick snow.

2200
02:44:20,190 --> 02:44:26,290
After that time it was impossible for anyone
to leave the train.

2201
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:30,420
'Here is my first solution.

2202
02:44:30,420 --> 02:44:36,260
An enemy of Mr Ratchett got onto the train
at Belgrade.

2203
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:43,881
He was wearing a conductor's uniform and had
a conductor's key, with which he opened Ratchett's

2204
02:44:43,881 --> 02:44:45,670
locked door.

2205
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:51,300
He attacked Ratchett with a knife and killed
him.

2206
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:53,910
Then he went into Mrs Hubbard's compartment
-'

2207
02:44:53,910 --> 02:44:58,480
'That's true,' said Mrs Hubbard.

2208
02:44:58,480 --> 02:45:02,780
'He put his knife in Mrs Hubbard's sponge
bag.

2209
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:07,440
Without knowing it, he lost a button from
his uniform.

2210
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:14,830
Then he went out into the corridor, threw
his uniform into a suitcase in an empty compartment

2211
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:23,660
and, dressed in ordinary clothes, left the
train at Vincovci through the door near the

2212
02:45:23,660 --> 02:45:24,660
restaurant car.'

2213
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:29,170
'But that explanation does not work!'

2214
02:45:29,170 --> 02:45:30,561
cried M. Bouc.

2215
02:45:30,561 --> 02:45:38,090
'What about the voice heard inside his compartment
at twenty-three minutes to one?'

2216
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:45,120
'That was not Ratchett and not the murderer,
but someone else.

2217
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:49,670
Perhaps someone had gone to speak to Ratchett
and found him dead.

2218
02:45:49,670 --> 02:45:51,580
He rang the bell to tell the conductor.

2219
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:59,150
Then, at the last minute, he changed his mind
because he was afraid that

2220
02:45:59,150 --> 02:46:03,400
people would think he was guilty of the crime.'

2221
02:46:03,400 --> 02:46:07,430
Princess Dragomiroff was looking at Poirot
strangely.

2222
02:46:07,430 --> 02:46:15,720
'And the evidence of my maid, who saw the
man in uniform at a quarter past one?'

2223
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,010
she asked.

2224
02:46:17,010 --> 02:46:20,610
'How do you explain that?'

2225
02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:23,490
'It is simple, Madame.

2226
02:46:23,490 --> 02:46:29,511
She recognised your handkerchief and invented
her story to protect you.'

2227
02:46:29,511 --> 02:46:35,760
'You have thought of everything,' said the
Princess.

2228
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:38,580
There was silence.

2229
02:46:38,580 --> 02:46:45,320
Then everyone jumped as Dr Constantine suddenly
hit the table with his hand.

2230
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:47,320
'But no,' he said.

2231
02:46:47,320 --> 02:46:50,420
'No, no, and again no!

2232
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:56,140
That explanation does not work for so many
reasons.

2233
02:46:56,140 --> 02:47:00,521
You must know that perfectly well, Poirot.'

2234
02:47:00,521 --> 02:47:06,710
'Then I must give my second solution,' said
the detective.

2235
02:47:06,710 --> 02:47:12,030
'But do not forget this first one too quickly.

2236
02:47:12,030 --> 02:47:18,021
You may agree with it later.'

2237
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:26,210
Poirot looked around the carriage before continuing,
'It was immediately clear to me that many

2238
02:47:26,210 --> 02:47:28,631
of you were lying.

2239
02:47:28,631 --> 02:47:35,510
To protect someone, Mr Hardman, you should
spend the night in the person's compartment

2240
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:40,340
or in a place where you can see his door.

2241
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:49,300
Your method was completely useless - except
for producing evidence that no one in any

2242
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:53,320
other part of the train could be Ratchett's
murderer.

2243
02:47:53,320 --> 02:47:58,440
'Then there were Miss Debenham and Colonel
Arbuthnot.

2244
02:47:58,440 --> 02:48:05,200
On the platform at Konya, he called her Mary.

2245
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:12,860
A man like the Colonel does not use a woman's
first name when he has only just met her.

2246
02:48:12,860 --> 02:48:17,230
Clearly they were lying about their relationship.

2247
02:48:17,230 --> 02:48:21,580
'Mrs Hubbard also made a mistake.

2248
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:28,640
She said that her sponge bag was hanging on
the handle of the door to Ratchett's compartment,

2249
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:32,150
and that it hid the bolt on the door.

2250
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:40,380
That would be possible in compartments 2,
4 and 12, for example - all the even numbers

2251
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:45,120
- because the bolt is just under the door
handle.

2252
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:55,120
But in her compartment, number 3, the bolt
is a long way above the handle and so it could

2253
02:48:55,120 --> 02:48:59,490
not be hidden by a hanging sponge bag.

2254
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:04,840
Mrs Hubbard had clearly invented that story.

2255
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:09,890
'The watch in Ratchett's pyjamas was interesting
too.

2256
02:49:09,890 --> 02:49:14,110
What an uncomfortable place to keep a watch!

2257
02:49:14,110 --> 02:49:18,440
I was sure that it was a false clue.

2258
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:24,120
So was Ratchett murdered earlier, when a cry
came from his room?

2259
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:25,890
I think not.

2260
02:49:25,890 --> 02:49:31,511
He was so heavily drugged that he could not
defend himself.

2261
02:49:31,511 --> 02:49:34,090
He could not cry out either.

2262
02:49:34,090 --> 02:49:42,840
I believe that the cry at twenty-three minutes
to one - and the words in French - were planned

2263
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:45,040
to confuse me.

2264
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:49,980
MacQueen told me that Ratchett spoke no French.

2265
02:49:49,980 --> 02:49:55,980
I was meant to think that Ratchett was killed
at that moment.

2266
02:49:55,980 --> 02:50:00,710
'And the real time of the crime?

2267
02:50:00,710 --> 02:50:05,510
I think Ratchett was killed at almost two
o'clock.

2268
02:50:05,510 --> 02:50:10,370
And the murderer?'

2269
02:50:10,370 --> 02:50:15,130
He paused, looking at the passengers.

2270
02:50:15,130 --> 02:50:17,841
There was complete silence.

2271
02:50:17,841 --> 02:50:21,130
He continued slowly.

2272
02:50:21,130 --> 02:50:29,970
'Everyone was proved innocent by another passenger
- in most cases, a passenger who was unlikely

2273
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:34,120
to be a friend in an earlier life.

2274
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:41,620
MacQueen and Arbuthnot, the English manservant
and the Italian, the Swedish lady and the

2275
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:42,920
English governess.

2276
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:48,780
"This is very strange," I said to myself.

2277
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:52,750
"They cannot all be guilty."

2278
02:50:52,750 --> 02:50:59,030
'And then, ladies and gentlemen, I realised.

2279
02:50:59,030 --> 02:51:02,471
They were all guilty.

2280
02:51:02,471 --> 02:51:10,310
It was impossible that so many people connected
with the Armstrongs were travelling on the

2281
02:51:10,310 --> 02:51:12,760
same train by chance.

2282
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:18,530
It could only happen if it was planned.

2283
02:51:18,530 --> 02:51:25,330
That would also explain the crowded train
at a time of year that is usually quiet.

2284
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:30,760
There were twelve passengers, after Ratchett's
death.

2285
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,141
There were twelve knife wounds in Ratchett's
body.

2286
02:51:35,141 --> 02:51:44,240
In America, murder cases are decided by a
group of twelve ordinary people.

2287
02:51:44,240 --> 02:51:51,130
'Ratchett had escaped punishment from the
court in America, although no one doubted

2288
02:51:51,130 --> 02:51:52,550
that he was guilty.

2289
02:51:52,550 --> 02:52:02,300
I imagined a group of twelve people who decided,
when the court case failed, to give him his

2290
02:52:02,300 --> 02:52:05,360
punishment another way.

2291
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:12,240
And immediately the whole case became clear
to me.

2292
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:20,210
'Everything was explained - the strange wounds
that did not bleed, the false threatening

2293
02:52:20,210 --> 02:52:21,770
letters that were written only

2294
02:52:21,770 --> 02:52:28,520
to be produced as evidence, the description
of the dark man with a high voice that fitted

2295
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:35,260
none of the real conductors and could equally
mean a man or a woman.

2296
02:52:35,260 --> 02:52:44,000
I believe that everyone entered Ratchett's
compartment through Mrs Hubbard's - and struck!

2297
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:51,460
No one could know which strike actually killed
him.

2298
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:56,070
'Every detail of the evidence was very carefully
planned.

2299
02:52:56,070 --> 02:53:04,800
The only possible solution appeared to be
a murderer who joined the train and left again

2300
02:53:04,800 --> 02:53:06,380
during the night.

2301
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:13,410
But then there was the snow - the first piece
of bad luck.

2302
02:53:13,410 --> 02:53:20,910
I imagine that there was a quick discussion,
and everyone decided to continue with the

2303
02:53:20,910 --> 02:53:22,070
crime.

2304
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:30,000
It would be clear that the murderer had to
be one or more of the passengers, but they

2305
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,650
were still protected by each other's stories.

2306
02:53:33,650 --> 02:53:42,400
They added some extra clues to confuse the
case - a pipe cleaner, a lady's handkerchief,

2307
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:46,070
a woman in a red dressing gown.

2308
02:53:46,070 --> 02:53:55,040
The dressing gown was probably Countess Andrenyi's,
as there is no dressing gown in her luggage.

2309
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:58,921
'MacQueen learnt that we had seen the word
Armstrong on

2310
02:53:58,921 --> 02:54:02,080
the burnt letter, and told the others.

2311
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:04,970
It was their second piece of bad luck.

2312
02:54:04,970 --> 02:54:14,850
The position of Countess Andrenyi became worrying,
and the Count changed her name on the passport.

2313
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:21,480
'The plan was impossible without the help
of Michel, the conductor.

2314
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:28,920
But if he was one of the group, then there
were thirteen people, not twelve.

2315
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:35,470
I believe that the Countess, who had the strongest
reason to kill Cassetti, was probably the

2316
02:54:35,470 --> 02:54:38,180
one who did not do it.

2317
02:54:38,180 --> 02:54:44,420
Her husband has promised me that she did not
leave her compartment.

2318
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:46,190
I believe him.

2319
02:54:46,190 --> 02:54:50,900
'But why was honest Michel in this?

2320
02:54:50,900 --> 02:54:56,070
He was a good man who had worked on the train
for many years.

2321
02:54:56,070 --> 02:55:05,070
Then I remembered Susanne, the Armstrongs'
French maid.

2322
02:55:05,070 --> 02:55:08,240
Perhaps the unlucky girl was Michel's daughter.

2323
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:10,050
And the others?

2324
02:55:10,050 --> 02:55:18,580
Arbuthnot was probably an army friend of Armstrong's,
Hildegarde Schmidt the family's cook.

2325
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:25,570
Hardman probably worked as a detective on
the case, or perhaps he had been in love with

2326
02:55:25,570 --> 02:55:26,570
Susanne.

2327
02:55:26,570 --> 02:55:32,600
And then there was Mrs Hubbard.

2328
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:39,110
She had a difficult job, because she was in
the compartment through which everyone reached

2329
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:40,120
Ratchett.

2330
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:46,010
No one could say that they were with her.

2331
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:54,430
To play the part of this foolish old woman,
a true actress was needed - Mrs Armstrong's

2332
02:55:54,430 --> 02:55:57,960
mother, Linda Arden.'

2333
02:55:57,960 --> 02:56:00,320
He stopped.

2334
02:56:00,320 --> 02:56:10,550
Then, in a soft rich dreamy voice, very unlike
the one she had used on the journey, Mrs Hubbard

2335
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:14,610
said, 'I always liked playing amusing characters.

2336
02:56:14,610 --> 02:56:18,710
That mistake with the sponge bag was silly,
though.

2337
02:56:18,710 --> 02:56:28,470
We tried it on the journey east, but I was
in an even numbered compartment then, I suppose.'

2338
02:56:28,470 --> 02:56:32,561
She moved slightly and looked straight at
Poirot.

2339
02:56:32,561 --> 02:56:36,271
'You have guessed so much, M. Poirot.

2340
02:56:36,271 --> 02:56:43,440
But even you can't imagine what it was like
- that terrible day in New York when Hector

2341
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:47,601
MacQueen told us that Cassetti had walked
free from the court.

2342
02:56:47,601 --> 02:56:56,020
I was crazy with sadness and anger - and the
servants were too.

2343
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:59,200
Colonel Arbuthnot was there.

2344
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:02,100
He was Robert Armstrong's best friend.'

2345
02:57:02,100 --> 02:57:07,190
'He saved my life in the war,' said Arbuthnot.

2346
02:57:07,190 --> 02:57:12,380
'We decided then and there to give him the
punishment that the court had failed to give

2347
02:57:12,380 --> 02:57:14,850
him - death.

2348
02:57:14,850 --> 02:57:17,760
Perhaps we were mad

2349
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,660
I don't know.

2350
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:28,710
There were twelve of us - well, eleven, because
Susanne's father was in France, of course.

2351
02:57:28,710 --> 02:57:31,540
Mary planned all the details with Hector.

2352
02:57:31,540 --> 02:57:35,690
'It took a long time to perfect our plan.

2353
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:39,000
Hardman managed to find Ratchett.

2354
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,530
Then Masterman and Hector had to get jobs
with him.

2355
02:57:42,530 --> 02:57:47,960
We had a meeting with Susanne's father.

2356
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:53,471
For Colonel Arbuthnot, it was important that
there were twelve of us - it made it more

2357
02:57:53,471 --> 02:57:55,980
correct, he thought.

2358
02:57:55,980 --> 02:57:58,070
Michel was willing.

2359
02:57:58,070 --> 02:58:04,380
We knew that Ratchett would come back from
the East on the Orient Express, so this seemed

2360
02:58:04,380 --> 02:58:06,471
the perfect opportunity.

2361
02:58:06,471 --> 02:58:13,630
'We tried to book every compartment in the
carriage, but unfortunately one had been booked

2362
02:58:13,630 --> 02:58:18,190
long before for someone from the train company.'

2363
02:58:18,190 --> 02:58:20,980
She smiled at M. Bouc.

2364
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:28,000
'Mr Harris, of course, was invented - we didn't
want a stranger in Hector's compartment.

2365
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:33,340
Then, at the last minute, you came, M. Poirot.'

2366
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:35,000
She stopped.

2367
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:42,490
'Well,' she said, 'you know everything now.

2368
02:58:42,490 --> 02:58:45,750
But what are you going to do about it?

2369
02:58:45,750 --> 02:58:54,500
If someone must be punished, can't you blame
me and only me for the crime?

2370
02:58:54,500 --> 02:59:02,730
It's unnecessary to bring trouble to all these
other good people - poor Michel - and Mary

2371
02:59:02,730 --> 02:59:06,610
and Colonel Arbuthnot - they love each other
so much -'

2372
02:59:06,610 --> 02:59:10,940
Poirot looked at his friend.

2373
02:59:10,940 --> 02:59:15,640
'What do you say, M. Bouc?'

2374
02:59:15,640 --> 02:59:24,400
M. Bouc coughed and said, 'In my opinion,
the first solution was the correct one - definitely.

2375
02:59:24,400 --> 02:59:28,370
The murderer left the train at Vincovci.

2376
02:59:28,370 --> 02:59:35,370
I suggest that we give that solution to the
Yugoslav police when they arrive.

2377
02:59:35,370 --> 02:59:39,030
Do you agree, Doctor?'

2378
02:59:39,030 --> 02:59:42,460
'Certainly I agree,' said Dr Constantine.

2379
02:59:42,460 --> 02:59:51,301
'I think I made some - er - rather silly suggestions
about the medical evidence.'

2380
02:59:51,301 --> 02:59:57,830
'Then,' said Poirot, 'we have solved the case.

2381
02:59:57,830 --> 03:00:01,180
My work here is done.'
