00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,360
BRAINS

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,840
The small monkey carefully completed the 
last piece of the one-hundred-piece puzzle.  

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
When all the pieces of the 
puzzle were put together,  

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,400
they made a copy of Sunflowers, a 
picture by the famous painter, Van Gogh.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,400
'Well done, Max!' said a young woman in a white 
coat. 'It only took you twenty minutes this  

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,680
time - that's much better than the last time 
you tried it. Have a bite of lovely banana.'

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,400
The woman reached for the fruit from a bowl close 
by and gave it to the monkey. Max ate it happily.  

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,680
The woman's name was Gina Capaldi and she was 
twenty-six years old. She was studying for a Ph.D.  

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:12,800
at a university in Rome. She was hoping to become 
a Doctor of Science. Her ideas had already caused  

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:20,320
much excitement. Now her work was almost 
finished. Great things were expected of her.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,720
As Gina prepared the monkey's next 
drug, Max played with his Rubik cube.  

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,440
The Rubik cube was one of Max's favourite 
puzzles. He enjoyed turning around the  

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,520
sides of the cube in his hands so that each 
of the six sides was a different colour.  

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,560
Gina looked over at him and was pleased. 
He was getting better every day.

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
Max completed the Rubik cube in five minutes.

16
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:10,400
Mr Dimitri sat behind a big desk in a large office 
in a huge building in New York. On the front of  

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:21,280
his desk was a sign in gold letters which read: 
Mr Theodore Dimitri. On his door there was a much  

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,320
bigger sign which read: President of the Centre 
for Science and Business Development (CSBD).

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Mr Dimitri was middle-aged and wore a 
large dark-grey suit. He smoked a thick  

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,520
expensive cigar. The smoke 
from his cigar filled the room.

21
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,080
Today he was going to see his most promising 
new scientists. They were all studying for  

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,760
Ph.D.s so that they could become Doctors of 
Science. They had to give him their new ideas  

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:13,680
if they wanted money from the CSBD. Mr Dimitri 
did this every year. If he liked their work, CSBD  

24
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,920
would give them lots of money to develop it. 
That was the way to make money in the future.

25
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,920
And Mr Dimitri was good at making money. But 
if he didn't like the work of these scientists,  

26
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
or if he didn't like them, he 
didn't have to give them a cent.  

27
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,560
'After all,' Mr Dimitri 
thought, 'Business is business.'

28
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
Miss Epstein, his secretary, came into his office.

29
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
'Miss Capaldi to see you, 
Mr Dimitri, sir,' she said.

30
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,320
'Send her in, Miss Epstein,' said Mr Dimitri 
in a voice which was cold and business-like.

31
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,320
Gina Capaldi stood in her best suit and shoes 
in front of the big desk. She wanted to look  

32
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:19,520
her best before Mr Dimitri. In her bag was all the 
information needed about her work. She felt ready.

33
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,840
'Do sit down, Miss Capaldi. I've 
heard so many good things about you,'  

34
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,480
said Mr Dimitri in a voice that 
now sounded friendly and welcoming.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,600
'Thank you, Mr Dimitri,' said Gina. She sat down 
in front of the big desk. Then Miss Epstein seemed  

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,560
to appear out of nowhere with coffee and biscuits. 
She put them on the desk and was gone again.

37
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,440
'Allow me,' said Mr Dimitri, as he put his 
cigar down for a moment and poured the coffee.

38
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,840
Gina took her coffee and left the biscuits. 
She didn't feel like eating. She was nervous.  

39
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,920
Mr Dimitri smiled at her with teeth 
that were large and white. Perfect  

40
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,800
teeth. His cigar found its way back 
to his mouth. The smoke rose up.

41
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,840
'Tell me, Gina... may I call you Gina?' he asked.

42
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
'Of course, Mr Dimitri,' she answered.

43
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:46,800
Mr Dimitri continued. 'Tell me about your latest 
work; I've heard very interesting things about it,  

44
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,400
but I would like you to explain it 
clearly to a simple man such as myself.'

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,120
Gina knew that Theodore Dimitri was far from being 
simple. You don't get to be the head of CSBD,  

46
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,080
the biggest organisation of its 
kind, if you aren't very clever.  

47
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
She knew his decision could change her life.

48
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,480
Gina began: 'I've discovered a 
drug which raises intelligence.'

49
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:32,160
'Hold on, Gina!' said Mr pimitri. 'You mean to 
say you've found a way of making people smarter?'

50
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:41,760
'Yes,' Gina answered. 'And without any 
harmful side effects as far as I can tell .

51
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,160
'As far as you can tell?' Mr 
Dimitri said, his eyebrows raised.

52
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,760
'I mean,' said Gina, 'the work has not been 
used on people - I've only worked on animals.  

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Especially Max.'

54
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,760
'Max?' asked Mr Dimitri.

55
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,440
'Sorry - Max is a monkey,' Gina explained.

56
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,240
'A monkey...' said Mr Dimitri but his voice 
sounded less friendly than it had before.

57
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:28,160
Gina knew she had to persuade him somehow. 
'Max has done really well - it's quite amazing.  

58
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,800
He now has the intelligence of an eight-year-old 
human child. He can do many things...'

59
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:47,520
'You want money for a performing monkey?' 
said Mr Dimitri. He sounded a little annoyed.  

60
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,480
'I can go to any cheap show to 
see smart monkeys doing tricks.  

61
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
And I don't have to pay a 
lot of money for it, either.'

62
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,920
'Mr Dimitri,' Gina said as she reached 
for her bag, 'I have a video of Max.  

63
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,560
I think you should see it 
before you make any decisions.'

64
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,040
'Oh, you do?' His voice was 
lower - not a good sign.

65
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:31,120
'Yes,' said Gina. 'If you would allow me. I'm sure 
you'll be as excited as I am once you've seen it.'  

66
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Gina did not want to give up without a fight. 
Her future depended on Mr Dimitri's decision.

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,960
'Let's see what you've got,' 
he said in his low voice.

68
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
The video showed Max three years earlier,  

69
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,240
before Gina had begun to work on him 
when he was still a normal monkey.  

70
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Then, three months after her work had begun, Max 
was seen drawing simple pictures with a pencil.  

71
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:19,040
After a year he was spelling out simple words. 
After two years he could add and take away  

72
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:27,920
simple numbers. After three years he could 
read, write and do basic mathematics.  

73
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,120
He also understood everything Gina said to 
him. Max had come to see Gina as his mother  

74
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,120
and he loved her. The video finished with Max 
putting his arms around Gina while Gin" laughed.

75
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,160
'That's one smart monkey. Can you make 
him any smarter?' Mr Dimitri asked.

76
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,960
Gina knew he was interested. She was pleased.

77
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,800
'Max can be as intelligent as we 
want to make him, Mf Dimitri,'  

78
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,400
she said, trying not to show her 
pleasure in whac she had achieved.

79
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:23,760
'Yes,' he said. 'But could that monkey be made to 
be as smart as a man?'(Or a woman, thought Gina)

80
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,520
'As I said, Mr Dimitri,' said Gina, 'we 
can make him as intelligent as we want to.'

81
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:43,920
'You mean,' asked Mr Dimitri, 'that that 
monkey could get to be smarter than I am?'

82
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,600
'I suppose it is possible - there's no 
reason why not, as far as I can tell.  

83
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Although, of course, Max is a long 
way from that just now,' Gina said.

84
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,960
'But you're working on it, 
right?' Mr Dimitri asked.

85
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,840
'Well, er... yes.' Gina was less confident now.

86
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,880
'And what if you worked on a human being 
- could you make them smarter?' he asked.

87
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,440
Gina answered: 'I think so, Mr Dimitri.'

88
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,320
Mr Dimitri narrowed his eyes. 'You only think so?'

89
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,840
'Well,' said Gina, 'the brains of a monkey 
and a man are built in much the same way,  

90
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
so I'm almost certain.'

91
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:54,240
'Almost certain. Hmm...' Mr Dimitri 
looked out of the window, down at  

92
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,600
the streets of the busy city far below them. 
His cigar smoke rose lazily to the ceiling.

93
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Gina's hopes of money and success - and her 
Ph.D. - depended largely on the decision  

94
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
Mr Dimitri would make.

95
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,920
'Tell me, Miss Capaldi...' said Mr Dimitri.

96
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,920
Gina noticed he had stopped using 
her first name. This looked bad.

97
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,440
'... have you ever taken this stuff 
yourself to increase your own intelligence?'  

98
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,280
Widi that, he turned to look 
out of the window again.

99
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,800
'Of course not, Mr Dimitri,' Gina said to the 
back of his head. 'But if you think I should...'

100
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,840
'NO!'

101
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,720
Mr Dimitri had turned suddenly from the window 
as he said this. The speed of his action  

102
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:10,560
surprised her because he was such a large man. His 
eyes were wide and looked angry. Gina was scared.

103
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,600
'Miss Capaldi,' Mr Dimitri 
said, lowering his voice,  

104
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:28,480
'your work has been very good. In fact, it has 
been excellent and you have my congratulations.  

105
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:37,520
Unfortunately, I must ask you to 
stop what you are doing. At "once.'

106
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Gina's mouth suddenly felt very dry and 
she felt the hairs on her head rise up.

107
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:56,720
'But Mr Dimitri,' she said, 'I've 
done so much... all my work, my Ph.D!'

108
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,720
'Who is going to believe you if they wonder 
for one moment if you took some of this  

109
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:14,400
stuff yourself?' Mr Dimitri's voice softened. 
'They would say that anybody could get a Ph.D.  

110
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,120
with your wonder drug to help 
them. And they'd be right.'

111
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,320
'But I never... I mean... I wouldn't 
dream of doing such a thing!'  

112
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,000
said Gina. She tried not to show 
the disappointment she felt.

113
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,480
'Wouldn't you?' said Mr Dimitri. 'There 
are many people that would take this stuff.  

114
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,960
And many that would think that you had, too.'

115
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Gina looked alarmed, but said nothing.

116
00:14:50,880 --> 00:15:01,360
'Yes,' he continued, 'it's a sad fact but a true 
one. Many people would think that you had taken  

117
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:10,160
your own drug to make yourself smarter. They 
would see you as being no different to those  

118
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:18,480
athletes who take stuff they're not supposed to 
take. It might make them do better but it's not  

119
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:28,880
honest, is it, Miss Capaldi? And it's no 
different for CSBD - we do not want people  

120
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:37,040
to think that we are anything other than 
a completely honest organisation. If they  

121
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,760
ever thought we had anything to do with such 
behaviour they would never trust us again!'

122
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:55,040
'But I promise you... my work has all been done 
honestly,' said Gina. 'I never took anything!'

123
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,000
'But,' said Mr Dimitri as he 
looked straight at Gina's eyes,  

124
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,840
'you would if I asked you to, wouldn't you?'

125
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,000
Gina knew it was true, so she said 
nothing and looked at the floor.

126
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Mr Dimitri turned his great weight towards 
her and put his hand on her shoulder.

127
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:35,360
'I understand how much you want to succeed, Miss 
Capaldi. Don't worry... I'm going to talk to the  

128
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:44,080
people at your university - I think you should 
have a Ph.D. for the work you've done so far...'

129
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,760
Gina raised her eyes.

130
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:58,160
'Yes, Miss Capaldi, I believe in your 
honesty and believe you are a brilliant  

131
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,800
young scientist. I would very much 
like you to continue to work for us...'

132
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,320
Gina shut her eyes. She was tod happy to speak.

133
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:17,840
'... but in a different area,' Mr Dimitri added.

134
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,080
Gina opened her eyes. She could 
hardly believe what she had heard.

135
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,520
'But what about my work?' she asked.

136
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:41,120
'You may carry on if you wish,' said Mr Dimitri, 
'but you will have no money from us if you do. And  

137
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:50,560
I think I can say that nobody else will help you 
if I have anything to say about it - and I will.'

138
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,800
Gina felt bad about losing her work. But 
she had been offered a job - and her Ph.D.

139
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,320
'If you leave all your work with us, Miss Capaldi,  

140
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:15,760
we'll make sure that it is properly taken 
care of. After all, y^u have made a discovery  

141
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,600
which could change the world someday. And 
you can be sure that we will recognise you  

142
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:31,120
as the person behind it all when the time 
comes. But it could take a long time.

143
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,080
'But right now we would like to use 
your clever brain to the full in doing  

144
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:49,440
important work for us. And, of course, you will 
be safe in the knowledge that you have the CSBD  

145
00:18:49,440 --> 00:19:00,000
behind you. You will never be short of money 
again. So why not join us, Gina? What do you say?'

146
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,960
Gina felt surprisingly good about the offer.

147
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,040
And I'll get recognition for my work?' Gina asked.

148
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
'Definitely' said Mr Dimitri.

149
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,520
'Mr Dimitri, I accept!'

150
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,080
There were smiles and goodbyes and, soon 
after, a happy Gina Capaldi left the room.

151
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Mr Dimitri sat down, lit another cigar and watched 
the smoke rise up to the ceiling before it finally  

152
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:49,120
disappeared. He knew that business was not good 
when people asked too many questions. If people  

153
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:57,360
were made to be too smart they would do just that. 
And once they didn't get the answers they wanted,  

154
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,840
they might not buy things. And if they didn't 
buy things there would be no money to be made.

155
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,280
No-one would like that. No-one at all.

156
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,840
Miss Capaldi's work would be put 
away somewhere nice and safe.  

157
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:28,320
Somewhere secret. Along with all the 
other dangerous ideas. Like the car  

158
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,960
that ran on water, or the shoes that never 
wore out, or the battery that never stopped.

159
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,080
But he was glad to have Miss Capaldi. She was 
bright. He ought to give her something to do.  

160
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,600
Something that would make a lot of 
money. He picked up his telephone.

161
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,000
'Miss Epstein... See that Miss Capaldi 
is sent to the biological science  

162
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,640
centre. I want her to be a part of that 
three-legged chicken plan. She can do it,  

163
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:18,240
if anybody can. She's one smart 
lady. Oh, and Miss Epstein...'

164
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
'Yes, Mr Dimitri?' said Miss Epstein.

165
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,760
'I want you to see that a dangerous animal from 
one of our centres is killed. It's a monkey.  

166
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:43,840
His name is Max.'
 
 
 
 
 
 

167
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,141
- THE END -
