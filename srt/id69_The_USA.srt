00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,690
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,970
In the beginning

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:14,679
Think of a big, beautiful, empty land with
mountains, forests, lakes, animals, and fish,

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,340
but no people.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,650
This was America 16,000 years ago.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,449
Around that time, the first people probably
arrived in Alaska from Asia.

7
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:37,260
They travelled south and became the Native
Americans of North America and the Maya, Aztecs,

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,000
Inca and other peoples of Central and South
America.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,140
The Inuit (Eskimos) came to Canada and the
Arctic the same way.

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,540
But there are only a few of these peoples
in America today.

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,969
In the sixteenth century Europeans started
to come to America, and soon after that, they

12
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:10,140
brought slaves from Africa to work for them.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,569
Large numbers of immigrants continued to arrive
from all over the world until the middle of

14
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:19,390
the twentieth century.

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,360
The empty land was now full of people, speaking
different languages and with different ideas.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:37,789
There are just three countries now in North
America - Canada, Mexico and the USA - but

17
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,460
there were nearly several more.

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,029
And the 300 million people who live in the
fifty states of the United States are not

19
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:51,020
all the same.

20
00:01:51,020 --> 00:02:02,421
About 67 per cent are white, 13 per cent Hispanic
(Spanish-speaking), 13 per cent black, 4 per

21
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:09,610
cent Asian and just 1 per cent Native American.

22
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:17,170
Most of them speak English, but it is not
the same English as people speak in Britain,

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,720
and many Americans speak Spanish as their
first language.

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,930
So how was the USA born?

25
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,320
How did it grow?

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,220
What kind of country is it now?

27
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:51,320
This book will try to answer those questions,
and many more.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,870
CHAPTER TWO

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,900
The Pilgrim Fathers

30
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:04,440
The name 'America' comes from an Italian businessman
called Amerigo Vespucci, who sailed to South

31
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,590
America between 1499 and 1502.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:17,310
But he was not the first European to make
the dangerous journey across the Atlantic.

33
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:27,250
The Vikings came to 'Vinland' (probably Canada
or New England) from Scandinavia around AD

34
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,660
1000, but they did not stay.

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:40,370
Then, in 1492, a brave Italian sailor called
Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean

36
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,400
while he was looking for a sea route from
Europe to India.

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:54,560
Columbus called the Native Americans 'Indians'
because he thought that he had reached India.

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,030
When Columbus returned to Europe he told people
about his adventures and other sailors like

39
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,180
Cabot and Cartier followed him across the
Atlantic.

40
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,410
Europeans came to fish the rich seas of America
too.

41
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,430
But it was only in the seventeenth century
that the French, the Dutch and the British

42
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:29,680
all came to live in North America: the French
in Quebec, the Dutch in New York and the British

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,520
in Virginia and New England.

44
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,240
Two very different groups of English people
crossed the Atlantic.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,040
The first group began the colony of Jamestown
in Virginia in 1607.

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,889
They hoped to find gold there, but life was
very hard for them.

47
00:04:51,889 --> 00:05:00,000
There was very little food, and many of them
died during the first winter.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,260
Then Pocahontas, the daughter of a Native
American chief, became a friend of Captain

49
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,150
John Smith and helped him and the other English
people.

50
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:19,180
She later married a man called John Rolfe
and went to England with him.

51
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,310
Luckily, tobacco saved the young colony.

52
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:32,490
It was easy to grow tobacco in Virginia, and
smoking was becoming very fashionable.

53
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,610
People in the colony stopped looking for gold
and began to grow tobacco, which they sold

54
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,139
in Europe.

55
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:49,260
Soon they started to bring people from Africa
to work as their slaves and help them to grow

56
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,290
more and more.

57
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:02,140
John Smith travelled north in 1614 to the
part of America that he called New England.

58
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,290
When he returned to London, he told people
that it was a good place to live.

59
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:21,020
In 1620, another group of 101 English men,
women and children arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

60
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,860
These people are called the 'Pilgrims' or
'Pilgrim Fathers', and they had very strong

61
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,370
ideas about religion.

62
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:38,210
They did not want to live in England because
they did not agree with the English church,

63
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,610
so they sailed to America in a ship called
the Mayflower.

64
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,479
They farmed the land and they bought and sold
animal skins.

65
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,720
They thought that all people were equal and
so they did not have slaves.

66
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,180
The Pilgrims too were often ill and hungry,
and nearly half of them died in the first

67
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,020
year.

68
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:16,860
But they had help from some of the Native
Americans, particularly a man called Squanto.

69
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:25,870
He went to Europe as a prisoner in 1605, and
spent some years in England, so he spoke some

70
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,550
English.

71
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,580
He showed the Pilgrims how to hunt and grow
corn.

72
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,830
In the autumn of 1621, the Pilgrims had a
big dinner to give thanks for the first food

73
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,930
that they had grown themselves.

74
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:51,070
This day was called Thanksgiving, and Americans
still celebrate it every year, on the fourth

75
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,830
Thursday of November.

76
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,340
It is one of the most important holidays in
the year, and people often travel many hundreds

77
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,410
of kilometres to be with their families.

78
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:11,410
They eat a big dinner with two of the foods
that the Pilgrim Fathers found in America,

79
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:26,790
turkey and pie filled with pumpkin.

80
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,419
CHAPTER THREE

81
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,430
The War of Independence

82
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,010
More and more British people came to live
on the east coast of North America in the

83
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:46,750
seventeenth century, starting colonies in
Maryland, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire,

84
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,740
North and South Carolina, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania.

85
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,520
Georgia followed in the eighteenth century,
when the British also took New York and Delaware

86
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,070
from the Dutch.

87
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,670
By 1770, there were thirteen colonies along
the east coast of North America, and they

88
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,930
were all governed by Britain.

89
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:19,050
But Britain was a long way away, and the people
of the colonies became angry at the high taxes

90
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,510
that the government made them pay.

91
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:32,930
In December 1773 a group of men threw 342
boxes of tea into the sea at Boston because

92
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,020
they did not want to pay the British tax on
it.

93
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,660
This was the 'Boston Tea Party'.

94
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:50,510
The British government was now angry too,
and in April 1775 some Americans fought a

95
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:59,820
group of British soldiers at the towns of
Lexington and Concord, near Boston in Massachusetts.

96
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,130
More and more Americans arrived until the
British soldiers had to move back to Boston.

97
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:15,700
A few months later, after the Battle of Bunker
Hill, near Boston, it was clear that Britain

98
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,959
was at war with its American colonies.

99
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:28,490
A rich farmer from Virginia, George Washington,
became the chief of the American army.

100
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:35,320
People tell a story about Washington, to show
that he was an honest man.

101
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,490
They say that when he was a boy he cut down
a tree and this made his father angry.

102
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:52,080
But when his father asked him about it, he
told him, 'I cannot tell a lie, I cut down

103
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,420
the tree.'

104
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,660
The colonies did not say that they wanted
to be fully independent until the summer of

105
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,320
1776.

106
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:12,670
A man called Thomas Jefferson wrote the famous
'Declaration of Independence' where he said

107
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,140
that the king, George the Third, was not a
good king because he had not let his people

108
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:27,850
have their rights: the right to life, to freedom
and to happiness.

109
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:37,500
The day of the Declaration of Independence,
4 July, is another important American holiday.

110
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:45,890
The Americans finally won the war in October
1781, and two years after that, they were

111
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,230
free to govern themselves.

112
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,440
In 1789 they made George Washington their
first president.

113
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,760
Although he wanted to go back to his farm
at Mount Vernon and enjoy a quiet life he

114
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,820
stayed president until 1797.

115
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:17,200
He died in 1799, just two years after he returned
home.

116
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,339
The names 'United States of America' and 'American'
were first used at the time of the War of

117
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:26,600
Independence.

118
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,540
The thirteen colonies became the first thirteen
states of the United States.

119
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,940
In 1803, after Jefferson became the third
president, he bought a large area of land

120
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,430
in the Midwest from France.

121
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:51,950
It was five times as big as France, and it
only cost 15 million dollars.

122
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:59,310
Jefferson then sent two brave men, Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark, to travel across

123
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,470
America all the way to the Pacific.

124
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,670
With a young Native American woman called
Sacagawea to help them, the two men travelled

125
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,800
13,000 kilometres between 1804 and 1806.

126
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,830
They found many animals, plants, and fish
that were new to Europeans, and they made

127
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,550
maps of the rivers, mountains, and land that
they crossed.

128
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,950
In 1819, the USA bought Florida from Spain.

129
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,950
The United States was now twice as big as
it had been in 1781.

130
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:53,600
And by 1848, after it won Texas and the Southwest
from Mexico, it had grown again.

131
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:02,320
It now reached all the way from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, over 5,000 kilometres.

132
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:11,180
Finally, the American government bought the
land north-west of Canada from Russia in 1867

133
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:20,730
for 7.2 million dollars and it became the
state of Alaska in 1959.

134
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,300
The American flag, known as the 'Stars and
Stripes', first appeared at the time of the

135
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,110
War of Independence.

136
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,980
It has a stripe for each of the first thirteen
states, and a star was added every time a

137
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,830
new state joined, so there are now fifty stars.

138
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:50,720
The last star was added when the beautiful
islands of Hawaii, in the Pacific 4,000 kilometres

139
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:09,470
west of California, became the fiftieth state
of the USA in 1959.

140
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,140
CHAPTER FOUR

141
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,920
The Civil War

142
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,540
The young country grew quickly, and by the
middle of the nineteenth century it had 31

143
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,339
million people.

144
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,620
But there were serious differences between
the North and the South.

145
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,779
And in 1861 a terrible war started.

146
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:40,089
At least 600,000 people died in the battles
or from disease.

147
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:47,350
The war began because the southern states
kept slaves to work in the cotton fields but

148
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,760
slaves were not allowed in the North.

149
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,570
People from the South wanted to have slaves
in the new lands of the west, but people from

150
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,750
the North argued against this.

151
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:10,140
In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected sixteenth
president of the USA.

152
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:17,720
He belonged to the Republican Party, which
did not want people to have slaves.

153
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:25,920
On 24 December, South Carolina said that it
wanted to be independent and the other southern

154
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,660
states soon followed.

155
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:37,160
The fighting began on 12 April 1861, at Fort
Sumter.

156
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:44,740
The South had some of the best soldiers - one
was the famous Robert E. Lee - and they had

157
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,490
plenty of money from selling their cotton
to Britain.

158
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,420
But the North had more men and more factories.

159
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:02,410
They also had Lincoln, one of the best presidents
that the USA has ever had.

160
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:11,260
He was born on a farm in Kentucky but he worked
hard in order to learn as much as he could.

161
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,030
Lincoln made the Republican Party strong and
spoke about rights and freedom.

162
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:26,449
A very important battle was won by the soldiers
of the North at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania

163
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,350
in 1863.

164
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:36,550
Lincoln spoke there afterwards about the brave
soldiers who had died.

165
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:45,040
This became known as the Gettysburg Address
and contains the famous words: '...government

166
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:51,820
of the people, by the people, for the people.'

167
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,200
Two famous soldiers helped the North to win
the war.

168
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,450
General Sherman is remembered in a famous
song that tells the story of how he took 60,000

169
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:13,590
of his soldiers on a journey of 400 kilometres
from Atlanta in Georgia to the Atlantic coast.

170
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:21,100
In this way he cut a wide path through the
southern states, and after that it was hard

171
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:27,760
for the armies of the South to join together
and fight the North.

172
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,420
After the war, Sherman became head of the
American army.

173
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:43,540
General Ulysses S. Grant represented the North
at Appomattox in 1865 when the South, under

174
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,730
Lee, accepted that they had lost the war.

175
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,650
Grant was very fair to Lee's soldiers, who
did not have to go to prison.

176
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,990
Some years later, in 1868, he became president.

177
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:12,940
Sadly, on 14 April 1865, five days after the
end of the war, President Lincoln was shot

178
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:20,400
at the theatre by a man called John Wilkes
Booth, who hated Lincoln and was angry about

179
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,140
the war.

180
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,790
After Lincoln's death, the new president was
not strong enough to bring the North and the

181
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:37,050
South together, and people continued to argue
about the rights of black people.

182
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,420
During the Civil War Louisa May Alcott wrote
her famous book Little Women about a family

183
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:51,280
of four girls living at home in the North
with their mother while their father was away

184
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,990
at the war.

185
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:01,770
Another very famous book (and later film)
about the war is Gone with the Wind written

186
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,820
in 1936.

187
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:12,160
It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a rich
young girl who is living comfortably in the

188
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:29,690
southern state of Georgia when her life is
destroyed by the war.

189
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,340
CHAPTER FIVE

190
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,610
The Wild West

191
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:41,039
During the nineteenth century, more and more
people went to live in the West of the USA.

192
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:49,370
The 'Wild West' that you can see on television
and in films is full of cowboys, Indians,

193
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,440
and fighting.

194
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:00,120
In fact there were very few cowboys - no more
than 40,000 - and real cowboys did not shoot

195
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,320
each other or fight Indians very often.

196
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,220
They worked hard at their job, taking care
of the cows, and at least a quarter of them

197
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,290
were black or Mexican.

198
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,710
They took cows from Texas up to the railway
towns in Kansas and Missouri.

199
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,500
From there the cows were sent to Chicago and
killed, and the meat was sent to the East

200
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,670
and sold.

201
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:37,340
The cowboys almost disappeared after about
thirty years because the government gave the

202
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,450
land to farmers and their families.

203
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:49,809
From 1862 to 1900 more than half a million
farmers came to live in the West, where they

204
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,350
made new farms and grew food.

205
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:01,770
One family that moved west was the Ingalls
family, whose daughter Laura Ingalls Wilder

206
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:08,600
told the story of their journey in books like
Little House on the Prairie.

207
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,980
Life for these farmers was very hard, particularly
in winter.

208
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:23,169
The farms were very lonely, but soon the railways
helped to bring people together.

209
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:33,270
In 1869, the railway line from the east met
the line from the west in Utah, so then Americans

210
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,860
could travel right across the USA by train.

211
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:48,110
Before the railway, from 1860 to 1861 the
post was carried across the country by the

212
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,720
famous Pony Express.

213
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:59,270
Horses and riders waited at different places;
one man rode with a bag of letters for about

214
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,220
120 kilometres and then gave it to the next
man.

215
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,789
In this way, letters only took about ten days
to cross the country.

216
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:16,840
One very well-known rider was Buffalo Bill
Cody.

217
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:28,000
He later became a soldier and a hunter - they
say that he shot 4,280 buffalo in one year!

218
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,440
In the 1880s, Buffalo Bill started his Wild
West Show, a kind of travelling theatre, with

219
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:50,880
the famous cowgirl Annie Oakley.

220
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,620
CHAPTER SIX

221
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,070
Native Americans

222
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,940
There were about two million Native Americans
in North America in the fifteenth century

223
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,840
when the Europeans arrived.

224
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:12,370
They belonged to 300 different groups and
spoke more than 2,000 different languages.

225
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:19,860
Sadly, the Europeans fought and killed many
Native Americans and also brought diseases

226
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,480
which killed them.

227
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:30,210
The film The Last of the Mohicans, from the
book by James Fenimore Cooper, shows the sad

228
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:36,059
end of a group of Native Americans in the
eighteenth century.

229
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:43,540
The Native Americans that we know as 'Indians'
in cowboy films lived in the West.

230
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:52,710
They were the Cheyenne, the Blackfoot, and
the Sioux (also known as Lakota), for example.

231
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:59,220
There were about 60 million buffalo in North
America, and the Native Americans hunted them

232
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:06,380
and used them for food, clothes, houses, knives,
and other things.

233
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:13,330
But when the Europeans arrived, they wanted
to take the land for farms or railways.

234
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,840
They shot millions of buffalo, and by 1900
there were fewer than a thousand of these

235
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:29,890
animals in all of the USA - and fewer than
250,000 Native Americans!

236
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:35,620
The great Sioux chief Sitting Bull fought
against the white men who wanted to move his

237
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,490
people from their own land to 'Indian' land
further west.

238
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:51,350
He won an important battle at Little Big Horn
in 1876 but could not win the war.

239
00:25:51,350 --> 00:26:00,260
The 'Indian wars' ended in 1890 with the Battle
of Wounded Knee, when American soldiers killed

240
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,020
many Sioux men, women and children.

241
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:13,210
After this, Native Americans had to live in
special places called 'reservations'.

242
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:21,180
Even today, about a third of the 4.4 million
Native Americans live on reservations.

243
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:28,370
They are often very poor and a lot of them
do not have jobs, so they sometimes drink

244
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,750
too much alcohol in order to forget their
problems.

245
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,040
Some Native Americans build casinos where
people can go to win money from cards and

246
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,470
other games, and this brings in money for
the reservations.

247
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:54,520
Other groups refuse to do this and also do
not allow alcohol on their reservations.

248
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:03,190
Many of the big reservations are in the Southwest,
the home of a different type of Native American.

249
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,120
Among the people of the Southwest are the
Hopi and the Zuni.

250
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:15,620
They keep sheep, make pots, and also make
beautiful jewellery from silver and blue-green

251
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,540
stones.

252
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:24,559
Their religion is very important to them;
their dancing often has a religious meaning,

253
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,090
and they make beautiful religious pictures.

254
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:39,059
The biggest reservation, where 200,000 Navajo
people live, is nearly 65,000 square kilometres.

255
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,370
The Navajo make wonderful coloured blankets.

256
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:51,090
The Navajo language is very unusual; during
the Second World War, the American army used

257
00:27:51,090 --> 00:28:09,640
Navajo soldiers to send secret radio messages
that the enemy could not understand.

258
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,630
CHAPTER SEVEN

259
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,690
New Americans

260
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:20,429
At the beginning of the nineteenth century
most American families had come from Britain,

261
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:26,340
Germany and Scandinavia, and they were farmers
or businesspeople.

262
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,210
But soon that began to change.

263
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:36,580
Factories were built and cities grew; poor
people arrived from other countries, hoping

264
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,450
to find work.

265
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:49,210
Between 1840 and 1900, about five million
people came from one country - Ireland.

266
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:56,029
Another five million immigrants came from
Italy, and millions more from Russia, Poland,

267
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:03,210
and other countries of Eastern Europe, hoping
to find jobs and freedom.

268
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:13,010
America kept an 'open door' until 1924 and
about 27 million people arrived between 1880

269
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,460
and 1930.

270
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,440
They were often poor, had different religions,
and had not been to school for very long;

271
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,120
there was a lot of prejudice against them.

272
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,810
Immigrants from Europe arrived at Ellis Island
in New York, where they were all checked for

273
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,820
disease and for other problems.

274
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:43,960
Close to Ellis Island is the Statue of Liberty
(liberty means 'freedom').

275
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:53,570
On it are these famous words: 'Give me your
tired, your poor ...' The statue welcomed

276
00:29:53,570 --> 00:30:01,580
the poor, tired immigrants who hoped for a
happier life in the USA.

277
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:09,190
The Chinese immigrants who arrived in the
West of the USA also found prejudice.

278
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:17,440
Many people came to live in California after
gold was found there in 1848, and among them

279
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,490
were 300,000 Chinese.

280
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,610
Many of the Chinese stayed to work building
the new railways.

281
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:35,760
Like black people and Native Americans, the
Chinese had no civil rights and after 1882,

282
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,570
they were no longer allowed to enter the USA.

283
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:47,120
But in the twentieth century Chinese people
started to arrive again and now the cities

284
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,160
of the west coast have large numbers of Chinese
families.

285
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:59,919
The writer Amy Tan tells stories about life
as a Chinese American in The Joy Luck Club

286
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,529
and other books.

287
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:09,970
Today, most immigrants to the USA come from
Spanish-speaking countries like Mexico and

288
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,370
Puerto Rico.

289
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:19,149
More than six million have arrived since 1980
and Spanish has become the second language

290
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:22,610
of the United States.

291
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,029
The Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans
usually stayed in the big cities of the East

292
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:37,040
or the Midwest, like New York, Boston or Chicago,
and worked in the factories.

293
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,620
Although most of them learned English and
became Americans, they also wanted to keep

294
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,529
their own way of life.

295
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:52,830
So in many cities you can find places called
Little Italy or Chinatown, for example, where

296
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,310
the restaurants have Italian or Chinese food.

297
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:04,600
In New York, Boston, and Chicago, St Patrick's
Day is a big celebration for the Irish on

298
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:23,279
17 March and Chinese New Year is a big celebration
in San Francisco.

299
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,899
CHAPTER EIGHT

300
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,919
Black Americans

301
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:35,460
Today about 39 million of the 300 million
people in the USA are black.

302
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,980
They used to live mostly in the South, working
in the cotton and tobacco fields.

303
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:49,231
A story about the hard life of slaves, Uncle
Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, was

304
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:53,429
very popular in the mid-nineteenth century.

305
00:32:53,429 --> 00:33:00,460
It made a lot of people see that keeping slaves
was wrong, and it told the exciting story

306
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:07,169
of how a slave family escaped, using the 'Underground
Railway'.

307
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:14,280
This was not a real railway but a number of
places where slaves could find help.

308
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,750
People in each house could show them the way
to the next safe house.

309
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,910
Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were
famous slaves who helped many other slaves

310
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:33,279
to escape from the South to the North using
the Underground Railway.

311
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:41,960
Frederick Douglass escaped in 1838 and started
to work for the freedom of other black people.

312
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,230
He had understood that in order to be free
he needed to learn to read and write and he

313
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,750
wrote a book about his life.

314
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,260
After this he travelled to Europe to speak
about slavery and later returned to New York

315
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,940
and started several newspapers.

316
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,529
During the Civil War he told black men to
join the army to fight for the North and after

317
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:13,419
the war he worked for the government.

318
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:22,499
Harriet Tubman travelled 140 kilometres to
freedom in 1849 with the help of white people

319
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:25,069
and free blacks.

320
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:31,700
Although it was dangerous, she returned in
order to help her family, and she bravely

321
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:36,559
said, 'I can only die once.'

322
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:44,379
In the 1850s she helped more than 300 slaves
escape.

323
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:50,879
After the Civil War, white southerners were
angry that they had lost the war and angry

324
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,159
that slaves were now free.

325
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,640
They showed a lot of prejudice against black
people.

326
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,970
Some white people joined the Ku Klux Klan,
groups of men who dressed in white, covered

327
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:12,180
their faces, and went out to beat and murder
black people.

328
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:19,579
Black men could not vote until 1870, and even
after they got the right to vote, they often

329
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:24,209
did not use it because they were frightened.

330
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:30,990
The book To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper
Lee tells the frightening story of a black

331
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:37,200
man, Tom Robinson, in 1930s Alabama.

332
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,719
Although Tom has done nothing wrong, people
easily believe that he is a criminal - just

333
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,690
because he is black.

334
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,170
In the twentieth century, black people began
to travel to the cities of the North to look

335
00:35:54,170 --> 00:36:01,349
for work, so there are now more black people
in the North than in the South.

336
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,349
But even in the North, they lived separately.

337
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:13,719
In the South they had to sit separately on
buses and eat in separate parts of restaurants.

338
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:19,229
Until 1954, they also had to go to different
schools.

339
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:27,410
Then in the 1950s, a churchman called Martin
Luther King began to fight for the civil rights

340
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,099
of black people.

341
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:36,880
Groups of black people started to break the
law, but not in a violent way.

342
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:46,140
In 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, a woman called
Rosa Parks became famous when she refused

343
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,709
to give her seat on a bus to a white man.

344
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:56,819
Then more black people refused to use the
buses, and the bus companies lost a lot of

345
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,299
money.

346
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:05,769
Black people also started to go into 'whites
only' restaurants.

347
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:15,209
In August 1963 200,000 people met in Washington
and heard Martin Luther King speak about the

348
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:20,210
need for black people to be equal with white
people.

349
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:28,740
He began with these words, which have become
famous: 'I have a dream...'

350
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:37,410
Finally, in 1964, a law was passed which gave
black people their rights and Martin Luther

351
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,309
King was given the Nobel Peace Prize.

352
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:52,650
But in 1968, he was murdered in Memphis and
fighting started in more than a hundred cities.

353
00:37:52,650 --> 00:38:01,319
During the 1970s and 1980s, prejudice against
black people slowly began to appear less often,

354
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:06,459
and many black people now have good jobs in
business and government.

355
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:13,920
A black woman like Condoleezza Rice can represent
the American government in other countries

356
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,509
and perhaps even think about becoming president.

357
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:21,609
But there are still problems.

358
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:28,680
When Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city
of New Orleans in 2005, most of the people

359
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,209
who lost their houses were black.

360
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:37,380
Many of them waited a long time for help from
the government.

361
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,299
Was it because they were black?

362
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:52,040
A lot of people think so.

363
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,660
CHAPTER NINE

364
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,619
The government of the USA

365
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:05,739
The government of the USA has three separate
but equal parts: Congress, the President,

366
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:08,690
and the Supreme Court.

367
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:16,869
Women got the vote in 1920 and all Americans
can now vote when they are eighteen.

368
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:27,089
There are some rights that all Americans have
by law: for example, the right to speak freely.

369
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,750
Congress makes the laws.

370
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:38,539
There are in fact two 'houses' of Congress:
the Senate and the House of Representatives.

371
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:44,259
There are a hundred people in the Senate (two
from each state) and they are elected for

372
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,749
six years.

373
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:56,079
There are 435 people in the House of Representatives,
and they are elected for two years only.

374
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,589
The states with more people, like California,
have more representatives.

375
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:10,809
States which do not have many people, like
Wyoming or Delaware, only have one representative.

376
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:15,459
The President is elected by votes from each
state.

377
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:22,289
A state has the same number of votes as the
number of its representatives and senators,

378
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:27,160
so the states with most people become very
important.

379
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:35,329
Florida has 25 votes and so when just 51 per
cent of people in Florida voted for George

380
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:43,339
Bush in 2000 he got all 25 votes from that
state.

381
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:48,539
The President is the most important of all
the people in the government.

382
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:56,150
He (until now the president has always been
a man) is the chief of the country, like a

383
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:02,190
king or queen, and he is also the head of
the army.

384
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:09,339
He is elected for four years and no one can
be president for more than eight years.

385
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:18,920
He can say 'no' to laws passed by Congress
(but Congress can also say 'no' to him), and

386
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,019
he chooses the judges for the Supreme Court.

387
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:28,969
He lives and works in the White House in Washington
DC.

388
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:36,559
The Supreme Court is the most important court
in the country and has nine judges; their

389
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,150
job is to decide what the laws mean.

390
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,599
They can also say that Congress has made a
law which is wrong, or that the President

391
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,559
has done something wrong.

392
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:58,130
As well as the government in Washington, each
state has its own government.

393
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,790
Laws can be very different from one state
to the next.

394
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:09,780
They say very different things about, for
example, how old you must be to get married,

395
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,010
or to drive a car.

396
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:20,589
Different states punish criminals differently
too; in some states, you must die if you murder

397
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:26,459
someone, but in others you only go to prison.

398
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:33,410
The island of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean
is not a state, but it is not independent

399
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,920
either.

400
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:43,750
People from Puerto Rico do not pay American
taxes and cannot vote in American elections.

401
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:50,579
There are two important political parties:
the Republicans and the Democrats.

402
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:57,099
The Republicans want people to work to help
themselves, and so they think that taxes should

403
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,180
be low.

404
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:06,299
The Democrats think that the government should
help the poor and so it needs taxes.

405
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:11,760
But the difference between the two is not
always clear.

406
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,059
After the 2000 election a map showed that
the Democrat states were on the north-east

407
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:25,209
and west coasts and around the Great Lakes
in the North, but the Republican states were

408
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:31,670
across the centre and in the South of the
USA.

409
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,559
Americans are happy that they do not have
a king or queen and they say that anyone can

410
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,980
become president.

411
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:46,920
But you need a lot of money to tell people
about yourself and your ideas, so it is easier

412
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,160
to become president if you come from a rich
family.

413
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:00,619
The second and sixth presidents, John Adams
and John Quincy Adams, were father and son,

414
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:06,359
and in modern times the Bush family has had
two presidents.

415
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:16,940
From 1989 to 1993 George Bush was president,
and in 2001 his son George W. Bush became

416
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,369
president too.

417
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:25,539
At the same time Jeb Bush, the brother of
George W. Bush, was head of the government

418
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:28,089
of Florida.

419
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:33,400
Some other families have also nearly had two
presidents.

420
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,099
President Kennedy's brother Robert hoped to
become president but he was killed in 1968,

421
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:46,869
and many people think that Hillary Clinton
will follow her husband Bill.

422
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:51,489
If she does, she will be the first woman president.

423
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:58,680
A president must also be able to speak well
to crowds of people.

424
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:06,109
Ronald Reagan, the fortieth president, could
do this because he used to be an actor.

425
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:17,730
He became head of the government of California
in 1967, and was president from 1981 to 1989.

426
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:23,499
Another actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, also
became head of the government of California

427
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:32,079
in 2003 and some people believe that film
stars will become successful politicians more

428
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:45,469
often in future.

429
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,069
CHAPTER TEN

430
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:50,680
Living in the USA

431
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:58,539
Many people who have never been to the USA
recognize it from films and TV programmes.

432
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:03,940
Then there is the work of the artist Edward
Hopper, whose pictures of ordinary American

433
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:12,380
people, streets, and houses, in the city and
in the country, make us think of old films.

434
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,369
But what is life in America really like?

435
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:23,739
Most Americans who have jobs live more comfortably
than people in almost any other country in

436
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,509
the world.

437
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:32,039
They usually work a forty-hour week and they
have two weeks' holiday a year as well as

438
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,299
holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.

439
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:42,299
In 60 per cent of families, the husband and
the wife both work.

440
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:49,359
Although more than 40 per cent of the land
is farmed, not many people work as farmers,

441
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:55,180
and fewer Americans work in factories than
in the past.

442
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:02,260
Most jobs are now in places like hospitals,
banks, hotels, and shops.

443
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:10,940
If you do not have a job (and around 6 per
cent of Americans do not), life is hard.

444
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:16,140
The government gives you a little money but
it is not enough to buy everything that you

445
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,410
need.

446
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,049
How many Americans are poor?.

447
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:30,780
Around 13 per cent of all Americans are poor,
but 25 per cent of black people and 22 per

448
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,589
cent of Hispanic people are poor.

449
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:42,059
The money in the USA is the dollar, which
contains a hundred cents.

450
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:51,699
Some coins have special names: 5 cents is
a nickel, 10 cents is a dime, and 25 cents

451
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:53,880
is a quarter.

452
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:03,520
In taxis, restaurants, and other places people
give a 'tip' - extra money on top of the price.

453
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:11,400
Without this extra money, many workers do
not have enough money to live.

454
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:18,449
Americans do not use kilograms and kilometres
but pounds and miles.

455
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:28,549
Dates are also written differently from dates
in Britain: 4 July is 7/4, not 4/7.

456
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:39,150
Sadly, the world learned about how Americans
say dates on 11 September 2001, the date that

457
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,199
we remember as 'nine eleven'.

458
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:50,729
Because the USA is such a big country, the
time changes as you travel from one side to

459
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:53,069
the other.

460
00:48:53,069 --> 00:49:02,269
When it is 12 midday in New York (Eastern
Time), it is 11 a.m. in Kansas (Central Time),

461
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:13,410
10 a.m. in Arizona (Mountain Time), and 9
a.m. in Seattle (Pacific Time).

462
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:21,229
And the time in Alaska is 8 a.m. and in Hawaii
7 a.m.

463
00:49:21,229 --> 00:49:27,499
The pictures by the artist Norman Rockwell
tell stories of the life of ordinary families

464
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:31,689
from the 1920s to the 1970s.

465
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:39,309
Although they are often too happy to be true,
they give us an idea of life in small towns

466
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,309
that has not all disappeared yet.

467
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:48,199
Two-thirds of Americans own their homes, often
with a garden.

468
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:56,359
At least 85 per cent of families have a car
and more than 75 per cent of Americans drive

469
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:58,440
to work.

470
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:06,630
They also use their car to go to 'drive-in'
restaurants, coffee shops, or even banks.

471
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:13,900
Henry Ford, who made the famous Ford cars,
was born in Michigan, near Detroit.

472
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:22,699
His 'Model T' (1908) was the first car that
was cheap enough for ordinary people.

473
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:32,449
'Anyone can drive a Ford,' they said, and
by 1918 half the cars in the USA were Model

474
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,140
Ts.

475
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,829
Now more and more Americans drive very big
cars called SUVs.

476
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:51,150
The USA does not have a state religion, and
no religion is allowed in schools.

477
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:57,449
Instead every morning American students make
a promise to the American flag.

478
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:03,710
But over 80 per cent of Americans belong to
a Christian church and Christianity is very

479
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:09,759
important, particularly in the South of the
USA.

480
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:15,890
In some states books are not allowed in schools
if they say something different from the Christian

481
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,599
story of the beginning of the world.

482
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,670
Some churches are just for black people and
black churchmen like Martin Luther King and

483
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:32,130
Jesse Jackson have worked very hard for the
rights of black people.

484
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:40,440
One large religious group is the Latter Day
Saints, or Mormons, who live mainly in Utah.

485
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:50,189
They have very strong ideas about how to dress
and are against alcohol and tobacco.

486
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:57,009
If they do not want to go out, Americans can
stay at home and watch television.

487
00:51:57,009 --> 00:52:05,420
Nearly all families have a TV and an ordinary
family watches more than seven hours a day.

488
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:14,799
There are over 10,000 TV stations, and most
of them belong to businesses, not to the government.

489
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:19,339
American TV programmes are sold all over the
world.

490
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:27,779
There are more than 1,500 daily newspapers
but most of them are just for one city.

491
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:35,660
The most popular newspaper is USA Today, which
sells five million copies a day.

492
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:41,849
You can buy papers like the New York Times
and the Washington Post everywhere, as well

493
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:45,880
as the magazines Time and Newsweek.

494
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:54,640
And, of course, Americans love to shop; the
supermarket first appeared in America, and

495
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,700
now many shops are open twenty-four hours
a day.

496
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:05,829
Some of the biggest shopping centres in the
world are in the USA - Mall of America in

497
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:14,069
Minneapolis has over 500 shops and covers
1.25 million square metres.

498
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:21,609
You could put thirty-two Boeing 747 planes
into it!

499
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:27,849
Americans have to pay if they visit a doctor
or go to hospital, but they do not usually

500
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:29,890
pay to go to school.

501
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:37,049
Schools, like the laws, are different from
state to state, but in most places, everyone

502
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:40,609
goes to school for about twelve years.

503
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:49,660
The years are called 'grades': grades 1 to
5 are 'elementary school', 6 to 8 are 'middle

504
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:55,299
school', and 9 to 12 'high school'.

505
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:01,400
About 85 per cent of students finish high
school and celebrate with a party known as

506
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,900
a 'prom'.

507
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,939
They also make a 'year book'; this has photos
of all the students in their class and some

508
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:14,640
information about each person.

509
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,219
Films like American Graffiti and The Breakfast
Club have shown what life is like at an American

510
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:23,859
high school.

511
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:31,640
About half the students who finish high school
go on to study for another two or four years.

512
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:42,269
Harvard and Yale in the east and Berkeley
in California are among America's famous universities.

513
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:50,369
Most Americans enjoy sports, and baseball,
basketball, and football are popular.

514
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:56,599
American football is a very different game
from European football; players carry the

515
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,239
ball more than they use their feet.

516
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,849
But the favourite sport in the USA is baseball.

517
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:11,640
The film Field of Dreams tells the story of
a farmer from Iowa in the mid-west, played

518
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,650
by Kevin Costner, who dreams of the Chicago
White Sox team and makes a baseball field

519
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,480
for them in a field on his farm.

520
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,170
Baseball is played by two teams of nine people.

521
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:35,009
Each player from the first team tries to hit
the ball and run round a big square from corner

522
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,029
to corner.

523
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:42,299
The players from the second team try to catch
the ball.

524
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:47,559
Players try to get all the way round the square
before the other team can get the ball to

525
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:49,979
a corner.

526
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:56,849
After three players go 'out', it is the turn
of the second team to hit the ball.

527
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:05,989
Some famous teams are the Los Angeles Dodgers,
the New York Yankees, and the Boston Red Sox.

528
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:10,969
Perhaps the greatest baseball player in history
was Babe Ruth.

529
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:19,559
He was born in 1895 and played with the Boston
Red Sox and then the New York Yankees.

530
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:37,980
He died in 1948 but he is still remembered
today.

531
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,509
CHAPTER ELEVEN

532
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,469
Eating and drinking the American way

533
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:46,230
What do Americans eat?

534
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:52,069
American 'fast food' is sold in restaurants
in almost every country of the world.

535
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:58,829
The most famous examples are probably hamburgers,
hot dogs, and chips, which are called 'french

536
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:00,489
fries'.

537
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:07,249
A lot of Americans are fat, perhaps because
they eat too much fast food.

538
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:13,809
These days many families in America do not
sit down to eat dinner together but eat alone

539
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:16,799
every few hours all through the day.

540
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:23,529
Sweet foods, like pies and ice-cream, are
very popular too.

541
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:29,229
The famous Ben and Jerry's ice-cream started
in Vermont in New England.

542
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:34,979
But more and more people are interested in
healthy eating, so they choose foods that

543
00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:40,489
are better for them or they decide to stop
eating meat.

544
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:45,920
If you visit the USA you will be able to enjoy
an American breakfast.

545
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:54,960
Eggs are cooked in a lot of different ways;
'sunny side up' means with the yellow on top,

546
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,789
'over easy' means with the yellow underneath
but still soft.

547
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:07,640
With your breakfast you can drink as much
coffee as you want, all for the same price.

548
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,920
In fact, you can drink coffee all day in the
USA.

549
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:20,410
It is of course the home of Starbucks, which
since the 1990s has changed the way everybody

550
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,599
drinks coffee.

551
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:31,719
Now all over the world you can go to a coffee
shop and choose from a very long menu of coffees.

552
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:36,299
What else can you drink that is really American?

553
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:44,319
Coca-Cola was first made in 1886 by an American
called John Pemberton.

554
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:53,249
Today it is sold in 195 countries and Coke
is one of the best-known words in the world.

555
00:58:53,249 --> 00:59:01,410
You can also find excellent American wine
from the west coast, particularly California.

556
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:07,470
But Americans are not allowed to buy alcohol
until they are 21.

557
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:15,229
In many states you cannot smoke in places
like bars, restaurants, and places of work.

558
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:23,179
From 1920 to 1933, during Prohibition, it
was against the law to drink alcohol at all

559
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:28,439
in the USA, but many people still wanted to
drink it.

560
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:36,719
So criminals like Al Capone brought alcohol
into the country and made a lot of money.

561
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:44,339
In American restaurants you can eat all kinds
of tasty food from different countries: Chinese,

562
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:48,219
Mexican, and Italian, for example.

563
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:54,749
The immigrants who came to the USA brought
their own favourite foods with them.

564
00:59:54,749 --> 01:00:01,710
These then changed into new styles of cooking
that are special to the USA.

565
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:10,799
For example Tex Mex (Texan Mexican) food is
like Mexican but uses more meat.

566
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:19,489
Cajun food is spicy food from Louisiana with
unusual names like 'gumbo' and 'jambalaya'.

567
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:26,239
'Soul food' is the food that black families
like to cook in the South.

568
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:34,179
It is usually meat or fish with green vegetables,
sweet potatoes, and corn bread, perhaps with

569
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:47,059
pie afterwards.

570
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,979
CHAPTER TWELVE

571
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:52,429
Music from America

572
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:56,920
All over the world people listen to American
music.

573
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,970
It began with the songs of black American
slaves.

574
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:09,140
Black slaves in the South sang work songs
and religious songs with a shape of 'call

575
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,859
and response'.

576
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:19,969
This is like a conversation in music - one
person sings, and then another answers.

577
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:25,799
When the slaves got their freedom after the
Civil War they began to tell their own stories

578
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:33,759
in music called the 'blues', particularly
in the area around the Mississippi River.

579
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:40,240
It had the same shape, where the singer sings
and the guitar answers.

580
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:50,689
The word 'blue' can mean sad, and the songs
tell a sad story of hard work and danger.

581
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:55,910
At the beginning of the twentieth century
black people moved from the South to the North

582
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:57,819
to find work.

583
01:01:57,819 --> 01:02:04,229
They took their music with them to cities
like Chicago and Detroit.

584
01:02:04,229 --> 01:02:10,309
Musicians like Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon,
John Lee Hooker, and Howlin' Wolf were the

585
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,829
first to use electric guitars.

586
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:21,569
Records of the blues became very popular in
the 1920s and 1930s when singers like Bessie

587
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:25,039
Smith became famous.

588
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:31,630
In the 1950s Elvis Presley, who came from
Mississippi, was the first white singer to

589
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:35,690
sing music that came from the blues.

590
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:43,609
In the 1960s 'soul' was born from the old
style blues, with singers like Marvin Gaye

591
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:45,739
and Otis Redding.

592
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:53,910
The city of Detroit has a lot of motor (car)
factories, and it gave the name 'Motown' (motor

593
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:58,329
town) to soul music.

594
01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:04,880
People all over the world listened to Motown
singers like Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, and

595
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,549
the Jackson Five in the 1960s and 70s.

596
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:15,869
Jazz was born in the city of New Orleans,
on the Mississippi River in the far south

597
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:18,329
of the USA.

598
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:25,699
It too probably began with the songs and dancing
of black slaves in the 1830s.

599
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:33,849
The musician Jelly Roll Morton said he was
the first to play 'jazz' in 1897, but nobody

600
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:37,130
really knows when it began.

601
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:44,890
Black musicians like Louis Armstrong became
famous in the 1920s in Chicago, and jazz music

602
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:53,250
became popular across the world after it travelled
to New York and Paris in the 1930s.

603
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:58,989
George Gershwin, who made music for films
and theatre, thought jazz was an important

604
01:03:58,989 --> 01:04:07,359
part of American life and he used it in music
like his Rhapsody in Blue.

605
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:13,509
During the Second World War, American soldiers
brought the 'swing' music of the big dance

606
01:04:13,509 --> 01:04:17,059
bands like Glenn Miller to Europe.

607
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:24,359
This was not jazz but part of the same family
of music.

608
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:32,819
Now names of great jazz musicians like Miles
Davis, Stan Getz, and John Coltrane are known

609
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:40,549
all over the world, and people write, sing,
and play jazz in many countries.

610
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:48,529
But New Orleans, where it all began, is not
the exciting place that it once was.

611
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:55,459
The city was famous for Mardi Gras, which
was like a wonderful party in the streets,

612
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:59,890
with colorful clothes, music, and dancing.

613
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:08,599
But the city is on land which is lower than
the sea, and in 2005 Hurricane Katrina covered

614
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:12,459
its streets and houses with water.

615
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:18,589
Several thousand people died, and the city
was badly damaged.

616
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:23,759
Will New Orleans live again one day as the
home of music?

617
01:05:23,759 --> 01:05:30,219
The musicians hope so, and many still come
every year to play in the New Orleans Jazz

618
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:33,189
Festival.

619
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:39,640
Another popular kind of American music is
'country' (or 'country and western') which

620
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,519
has its home in Nashville, Tennessee.

621
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:49,699
It started from the music of the Scottish,
Irish, and English people who came to live

622
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:53,049
in the Appalachian Mountains.

623
01:05:53,049 --> 01:06:00,299
Country music began to be really popular in
the 1920s, when Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter

624
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:09,410
family made the first country records and
the Grand Ole Opry radio show started in Nashville.

625
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:16,079
Music is still recorded in Nashville and if
you go there you can visit the Country Music

626
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,119
'Hall of Fame'.

627
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:25,609
One of the most famous women country singers
is Dolly Parton, who has also appeared in

628
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:32,190
films like 9 to 5 and Steel Magnolias.

629
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:41,049
Johnny Cash, 'The Man in Black', sold millions
of records in the 1960s and 1970s, and was

630
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:46,140
still popular when he died in 2003.

631
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:57,549
The 2005 film Walk the Line, which told the
story of Johnny's early life, was very successful.

632
01:06:57,549 --> 01:07:04,729
In the 1990s a new kind of music called 'rap'
became popular in New York.

633
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:11,910
It came from black and Puerto Rican people
and told of a dangerous life on the streets,

634
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,089
where there was fighting and killing.

635
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:21,309
Rappers don't sing but they talk very fast
over music.

636
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:39,319
Some famous rappers are Eminem, Snoop Dogg,
and Missy Elliott.

637
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:41,150
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

638
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:44,869
Some great American cities

639
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:49,589
Some of America's greatest cities are on the
Atlantic coast.

640
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:55,569
Boston in the Northeast, where the fight for
independence began in the eighteenth century,

641
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:59,869
is one of the oldest cities in the USA.

642
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:05,809
Here you can walk the 'Freedom Trail' and
visit the place where the tea was thrown into

643
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:06,970
the sea.

644
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:15,880
A few kilometres away in the city of Cambridge
is Harvard, the oldest university in the USA,

645
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,819
which was opened in 1636.

646
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:29,480
The famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) is in Cambridge too.

647
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:36,100
Perhaps the most famous family in twentieth-century
Boston was the Kennedy family.

648
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,790
Like many other Boston families, they came
from Ireland.

649
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:48,099
They became very rich, and John F. Kennedy,
a Democrat, became President of the United

650
01:08:48,099 --> 01:08:52,389
States in 1961.

651
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:59,889
At that time he said '... ask not what your
country can do for you, but what you can do

652
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,609
for your country.'

653
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:11,220
He and his beautiful wife Jacqueline were
young and popular, but sadly, in 1963, Kennedy

654
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:19,210
was shot and killed in Dallas, Texas.

655
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:23,599
New York is the biggest city in the USA.

656
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:28,630
It is a great place for theatre, shopping
and restaurants.

657
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:37,409
It is also the home of the United Nations,
whose offices are in a beautiful glass skyscraper.

658
01:09:37,409 --> 01:09:45,670
But people remember two even taller skyscrapers,
those of the World Trade Center, because on

659
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:55,969
11 September 2001 two planes flew into them
and killed nearly 3,000 people.

660
01:09:55,969 --> 01:10:03,000
The Empire State Building is now the most
famous skyscraper in the city once again.

661
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:15,030
It is 443 metres high, has 102 floors, and
has appeared in King Kong and many other films.

662
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:19,010
The Statue of Liberty is another favourite
place for tourists.

663
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:26,460
It is 93 metres tall and the best way to see
it is by boat.

664
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:36,960
It was a present from the people of France
for the hundredth birthday of the USA in 1876.

665
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,850
Many visitors to New York go there just to
shop.

666
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:48,599
The biggest shops, selling all kinds of things,
are Macy's and Bloomingdales.

667
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:57,260
Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue sells beautiful
jewellery but it is very expensive.

668
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:03,699
Times Square and Broadway are the centre of
the theatre area, and Greenwich Village has

669
01:11:03,699 --> 01:11:24,650
been the home of artists and musicians since
the 1940s.

670
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:31,110
There are many museums in New York and the
biggest is the wonderful Metropolitan Museum

671
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,119
of Art.

672
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:40,360
Or if you get tired of the city, you can go
into Central Park, a big area of green in

673
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,230
the middle of the busy streets of Manhattan.

674
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:50,020
Washington DC is the capital of the USA.

675
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:59,230
It was built in a special area, the District
of Columbia (DC), on land that came from the

676
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:02,340
states of Maryland and Virginia.

677
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:08,739
It is different from most American cities
because it has no skyscrapers; its highest

678
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:15,239
building is the Capitol, home of the Senate
and House of Representatives.

679
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:21,949
You can visit the White House, where the President
lives, as well as museums of history, art

680
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:24,810
and air travel.

681
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:32,010
Some of the city's most beautiful houses are
in the old area of Georgetown.

682
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:39,610
Much further south are the old cities of Savannah,
Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, where

683
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,860
there are also many beautiful old houses.

684
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:49,530
They look the same as they did 150 years ago
or more.

685
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,610
But not all southern cities are old.

686
01:12:53,610 --> 01:13:01,409
Atlanta in Georgia is big and modern, with
one of the busiest airports in the world.

687
01:13:01,409 --> 01:13:09,120
There are plenty of jobs, and people think
that it is a comfortable city to live in.

688
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:16,590
Away from the coast in the state of Illinois,
Chicago is sometimes called the 'Windy City'

689
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:21,719
because of the cold winds that blow in from
Lake Michigan.

690
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:29,050
The first really tall buildings were built
in Chicago after the great fire of 1871.

691
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:37,429
Today, the Sears Tower in Chicago (more than
500 metres high) is the tallest building in

692
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:39,630
the USA.

693
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:50,179
Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959), who made beautiful
houses and other buildings, worked in Chicago

694
01:13:50,179 --> 01:13:55,030
and you can see examples of his houses there.

695
01:13:55,030 --> 01:14:03,869
Like any big city, Chicago has factories,
shops, museums and restaurants, but only Chicago

696
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:10,610
has Wrigley Field, the famous baseball field.

697
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:16,320
On the west coast, Seattle has become one
of the most popular cities in America since

698
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,920
the 1980s.

699
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:26,369
In 1985 Starbucks started the fashion for
Italian coffee shops here.

700
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:34,800
In the 1990s it was the home of new music
from bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana.

701
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:42,659
Bill Gates of Microsoft, one of the richest
men in the world, was born in Seattle.

702
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:47,489
Films and TV programmes are made about people
who live in Seattle.

703
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:53,940
A city that was once quiet has become crowded
and more expensive.

704
01:14:53,940 --> 01:15:02,199
Las Vegas in the hot, dry state of Nevada
is full of casinos.

705
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:07,139
People win and lose thousands of dollars there,
playing cards or other games.

706
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:08,139
People also go there to get married quickly
and easily.

707
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:18,940
If you want, a man dressed like Elvis Presley
can be at your wedding!

708
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,239
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

709
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,800
California

710
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:31,210
More people live in California than in any
other state - over 30 million of them.

711
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:38,300
It is the biggest state after Texas and Alaska
and it is a state of differences.

712
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:45,639
The highest mountain in the USA outside Alaska
is Mount Whitney in the east of the state;

713
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:50,380
it is 4,420 metres high.

714
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:58,800
And California has the lowest, driest place
in the USA: Death Valley, which is 86 metres

715
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,230
lower than the sea.

716
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:11,810
It is very hot there (56.7 degree C on the
hottest day, in 1913) and in some years it

717
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:15,409
does not rain at all.

718
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:19,969
But the north of the state is quite cold and
wet.

719
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:26,300
This is where the great redwood trees grow
- the tallest trees in the world.

720
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:32,159
The biggest is 115.5 metres high.

721
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:39,659
Also in the north is the Napa Valley area,
where excellent wines are made.

722
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:46,550
California grows more fruit and vegetables
than any other state in the USA but it is

723
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:50,670
also famous for its computer factories.

724
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:56,790
Hewlett and Packard started their business
in California, and Apple have their head offices

725
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:59,820
there.

726
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:06,780
San Francisco is, many people think, one of
the most beautiful cities in the world.

727
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:14,010
In 1849, people came here to look for gold
and they became known as 'Forty-Niners'.

728
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:22,909
Jeans were first made in San Francisco by
Levi Strauss in those days.

729
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:30,780
The city grew fast but was nearly destroyed
in 1906 by an earthquake and the fire which

730
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,070
followed it.

731
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:41,590
There was another big earthquake in 1989 when
62 people died, and everyone knows that one

732
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,460
day there will be another.

733
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:53,360
But 800,000 Americans continue living in San
Francisco because life there is fun.

734
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,860
San Francisco was the meeting place for two
groups of people who wanted a life that was

735
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,969
different from the life of ordinary people.

736
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:10,900
In the 1950s there were the 'beatniks' (like
writers Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac),

737
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:16,050
who wore black and were not interested in
money and jobs.

738
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:22,170
Then in the 1960s 'hippies' came to San Francisco.

739
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:30,100
They wore bright clothes, had long hair, and
wanted a world full of peace and love.

740
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:38,820
1967 was the 'summer of love', with songs
that talked about peace and love and told

741
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:46,880
young people, 'If you go to San Francisco,
wear a flower in your hair'.

742
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:54,679
San Francisco is also famous for the Golden
Gate Bridge, which was built in 1937 and joins

743
01:18:54,679 --> 01:18:58,369
the city to Marin County.

744
01:18:58,369 --> 01:19:03,659
More than 40 million journeys are made across
it every year.

745
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:10,280
It is 2.7 kilometres long and 67 metres above
the water.

746
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:18,659
From the bridge you can see the island of
Alcatraz, which was a prison until 1963.

747
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:27,200
Los Angeles is the second biggest city in
the USA, with 3.8 million people.

748
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:35,420
It can take hours to drive from one side to
the other - and people almost always drive!

749
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:41,760
The number of cars means that the city has
a problem with dirty air; in some parts of

750
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,730
the city crime is a problem too.

751
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:51,989
But visitors still come to see places like
Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

752
01:19:51,989 --> 01:20:01,219
The first film was made in Hollywood in 1911
in a place where orange trees used to grow.

753
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:10,010
The first films, with actors like Rudolf Valentino,
Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton were silent,

754
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:14,860
but then in 1927 films got sound.

755
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:22,699
In the 1930s and 1940s famous stars like Clark
Gable, Humphrey Bogart, and Katharine Hepburn

756
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:32,800
appeared in films like It Happened One Night,
Casablanca, and The Philadelphia Story.

757
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:38,260
Some of the greatest films of the time came
from the crime stories of the famous Californian

758
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,360
writers Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler.

759
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:50,070
Chandler wrote about the detective Philip
Marlowe, who was played by Bogart in The Big

760
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,040
Sleep.

761
01:20:52,040 --> 01:21:00,449
Today, films are big business - it costs millions
of dollars to make them, but they can make

762
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:03,770
millions of dollars more.

763
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:10,190
On Hollywood Boulevard you can visit Mann's
Chinese Theatre, where film stars have left

764
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:14,440
the shapes of their hands and feet in the
ground.

765
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:21,960
You can visit Paramount Studios in Hollywood,
where the Godfather films were made, or Universal

766
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:29,070
Studios outside the city, where you can feel
an earthquake or see King Kong and Jurassic

767
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:31,050
Park.

768
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:37,969
In Beverly Hills you can drive past the homes
of famous stars.

769
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:44,860
Mickey Mouse first appeared in 1928 in films
by Walt Disney.

770
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:52,790
Disney died in 1966, but his company continues
to make very popular films like Pirates of

771
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:55,739
the Caribbean.

772
01:21:55,739 --> 01:22:00,850
Disneyland is the top place for tourists in
California.

773
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:05,019
It is in Orange County in the south of the
state.

774
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:12,470
If you visit Disneyland, you will meet Mickey
Mouse and his friends walking around the park.

775
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:19,679
You can visit the castle of Sleeping Beauty,
ride on a river boat, or have an Indiana Jones

776
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:33,989
or Tarzan adventure.

777
01:22:33,989 --> 01:22:35,650
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

778
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,510
Beautiful places to visit

779
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:45,130
The USA has some of the biggest cities in
the world, and more than three-quarters of

780
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:48,789
its people live in cities or towns.

781
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:55,619
This means that there are also some very empty
places, which have not changed much since

782
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:58,969
the first Europeans arrived.

783
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:05,860
The government has kept some of them as national
parks, beautiful natural places where people

784
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:10,280
are not allowed to build houses or factories.

785
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,559
Many artists have photographed the beautiful
parks of America.

786
01:23:15,559 --> 01:23:22,790
One of the most famous is Ansel Adams, who
was born in San Francisco a few years before

787
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,119
the earthquake of 1906.

788
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:33,250
Two of his favourite places were Yosemite
in northern California, which has been a park

789
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:39,719
since 1890, and the coast of California.

790
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:46,020
Travelling north from California, you come
to Oregon and then Washington.

791
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:54,329
These states are cool and wet, but very beautiful,
with big forests and high mountains.

792
01:23:54,329 --> 01:24:02,510
Here you will find a number of national parks
like Mount Rainier and Crater Lake.

793
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:10,760
The wonderful Rocky Mountains are in the states
of Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Idaho and Utah,

794
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,010
and are great for holidays.

795
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:21,590
Walking, climbing, fishing, hunting, and horse-riding
are some of the things visitors enjoy here.

796
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:29,170
You can also enjoy winter sports in places
like Aspen, where there is a lot of snow.

797
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:33,800
The only big city in the Rockies is Denver.

798
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:39,760
Also in the Rocky Mountains is Yellowstone
Park in the states of Idaho, Wyoming, and

799
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,860
Montana.

800
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:49,160
It is famous for the geyser called Old Faithful
that shoots hot water up into the air, up

801
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,960
to 55 metres high.

802
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:58,440
Salt Lake City, the capital city of Utah,
is next to a lake that is much saltier than

803
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,079
the sea.

804
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:08,090
If you try to swim in this lake, you will
find that you cannot stay under the water!

805
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:15,619
South of the Rockies is the hot, dry state
of Arizona, where the land has fantastic colours:

806
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:22,640
not just brown and green, but red, pink, orange,
and blue.

807
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:28,090
The most famous place in Arizona is the Grand
Canyon.

808
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:34,590
This deep river valley was made by the Colorado
River cutting through the rock many thousands

809
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,849
of years ago.

810
01:25:36,849 --> 01:25:48,099
Today it is 1,600 metres deep, 446 kilometres
long, and between 0.4 and 24 kilometres wide

811
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:52,310
with rocks in extraordinary shapes.

812
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:58,480
You can walk down to the river, but it will
take you two days to get there and back, and

813
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:03,239
you must take plenty of water to drink.

814
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:10,360
Next to Arizona, New Mexico is another hot,
dry state, where farming is difficult and

815
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:14,170
the ordinary people are poor.

816
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:20,469
But many artists have also come from other
parts of America to live in and around Santa

817
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:23,190
Fe and Taos.

818
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:31,860
One of the first was Georgia O'Keeffe and
there is a museum of her work in Santa Fe.

819
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:38,460
In the Badlands National Park of South Dakota
visitors remember the Sioux who fought and

820
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:45,080
died at Wounded Knee, but the Black Hills
of Dakota are famous for Mount

821
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:51,969
Rushmore, where the faces of four American
presidents, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln,

822
01:26:51,969 --> 01:26:56,300
and Theodore Roosevelt were cut in the rock.

823
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,769
It took fourteen years, from 1927 to 1941.

824
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:09,810
You can see them in the Hitchcock film North
by Northwest, where Cary Grant nearly falls

825
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:15,469
from the mountain while he is trying to escape.

826
01:27:15,469 --> 01:27:22,510
Canada and the USA meet at the five Great
Lakes, which are an important route for ships

827
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:28,960
travelling from the Atlantic to the Midwest
along the St Lawrence Seaway.

828
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:40,449
The famous Niagara Falls are between Lakes
Ontario and Erie.

829
01:27:40,449 --> 01:27:44,769
These waterfalls are 51 metres high.

830
01:27:44,769 --> 01:27:52,000
You can look at them from the top from Canada
or the USA, or you can take a boat trip and

831
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,329
see them from below.

832
01:27:54,329 --> 01:28:05,219
Together, Lakes Erie, Ontario, Huron, Michigan,
and Superior cover 244,108 square kilometres

833
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:10,500
- more than any other group of lakes in the
world.

834
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:16,360
If you go there in the summer, it is almost
like going to the sea; you can lie on the

835
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,159
beach or sail a boat.

836
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:25,489
But in winter it is very cold.

837
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:31,170
Thousands of kilometres south of the Great
Lakes is the state of Louisiana, which used

838
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:33,480
to be French.

839
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:41,400
The Mississippi River is 3,778 kilometres
long and in the nineteenth century it was

840
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,820
an important route between the North and the
South.

841
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:52,659
Mark Twain wrote wonderful stories about life
on and around the river: The Adventures of

842
01:28:52,659 --> 01:29:01,800
Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (1884).

843
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:07,690
Next to Louisiana, the state of Mississippi
was also the home of several great writers

844
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:14,159
like Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner.

845
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:20,019
Together the states of Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode

846
01:29:20,019 --> 01:29:23,769
Island are known as New England.

847
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:31,210
Autumn, or 'fall' as the Americans call it,
is a good time to visit New England, because

848
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:37,119
the leaves on the trees turn yellow and orange
and red and gold.

849
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:50,030
October is a good month to see the colours
at their best.

850
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,909
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

851
01:29:51,909 --> 01:29:56,469
Hot and cold, big and small

852
01:29:56,469 --> 01:30:03,320
Florida in the far Southeast is called the
'Sunshine State' because it is so warm and

853
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,320
sunny.

854
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:09,469
Oranges grow there, and visitors come to enjoy
beach holidays.

855
01:30:09,469 --> 01:30:15,349
They can also visit Walt Disney World and
the Kennedy Space Center.

856
01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:22,659
Florida has the Everglades, an area which
is not like any other place in the USA.

857
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:30,060
The land is very wet and has many trees, plants,
animals and birds that are not found in other

858
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,840
parts of America.

859
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:39,340
But Florida is very popular with older people
who want to live somewhere warm.

860
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:46,579
This means new houses and roads, and building
them has destroyed a lot of the land.

861
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:52,540
There are also more and more factories, and
some people are angry that this beautiful

862
01:30:52,540 --> 01:31:00,250
state is losing many of its wild birds and
animals because of its dirty air and water.

863
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:08,639
Cold, lonely Alaska is the largest state in
the USA, and Canada stands between it and

864
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,960
the other states.

865
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:18,579
Fishing and hunting used to bring money to
Alaska, and gold was found there too.

866
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:23,230
But today it is important for its oil.

867
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:31,560
North America's highest mountain, Mount McKinley
(6,194 metres), is in Alaska.

868
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:37,900
A great way to travel there is by boat from
Seattle.

869
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:44,760
Most visitors go in summer; in winter it is
very cold, and it is dark for most of the

870
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:48,469
day because it is so far north.

871
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:55,619
However, if you are lucky you will see the
Northern Lights (aurora borealis), which fill

872
01:31:55,619 --> 01:32:00,880
the sky with fantastic colours.

873
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,329
Texas is the second biggest state after Alaska.

874
01:32:05,329 --> 01:32:11,789
There are still cowboys who work there, but
the modern state of Texas, like Alaska, is

875
01:32:11,789 --> 01:32:14,809
rich because of its oil.

876
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:21,840
The smallest state of the USA is little Rhode
Island to the east of Connecticut.

877
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,730
Newport in Rhode Island has three big music
festivals each year.

878
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:34,039
In Texas the capital city, Austin, is also
famous for its music.

879
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:41,500
Janis Joplin sang there, as well as Bruce
Springsteen, Van Morrison, and country singer

880
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:48,079
Kinky Friedman, who also writes very funny
crime books.

881
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:55,030
The holiday islands of Hawaii are a long way
from the other states of the USA.

882
01:32:55,030 --> 01:33:02,000
Many Americans go there to enjoy the beaches,
like the famous Waikiki Beach, and the warm

883
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,770
sunshine.

884
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:09,300
Although there are a lot of tourists, you
can escape to quieter places where you can

885
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:16,090
see trees, waterfalls and many unusual plants
and birds.

886
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:22,480
There are sadly only 9,000 true Hawaiians,
but around a third of the people who live

887
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,690
in the islands are part-Hawaiian.

888
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:33,059
But there are more interesting and exciting
places to visit in the USA than will fit into

889
01:33:33,059 --> 01:33:34,860
one book.

890
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:44,760
Choose what you prefer, busy city or quiet
national park, cold mountains or warm sea,

891
01:33:44,760 --> 01:34:02,570
shopping or sports, and plan your own American
journey!

892
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:05,530
- THE END -
