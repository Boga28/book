CHAPTER ONE
The Future

2
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,140
Friday, 15th July 1988

3
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,930
Rankeillor Street, Edinburgh, Scotland

4
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:03,500
'The important thing in life is to make a
difference - to make a change to something,'

5
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,309
the girl said.

6
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,100
'Ah - you mean we have to change the world?'

7
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,540
the boy replied.

8
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,360
'No, not all of the world, we just have to
change the bit of it around us,' the girl

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
said.

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,750
She was silent for a moment, then she laughed
at herself.

11
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,810
'I can't believe I said that.

12
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,530
It's such a predictable thing to say, isn't
it?

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,390
But what are you going to do with your life?

14
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,740
What's your plan?'

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,630
'Well, my parents are coming to collect me
later today,' he told her.

16
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,170
'Then I'll go to France for a few weeks and
after that, maybe I'll go to China.'

17
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,550
'Oh, you're going travelling,' she said wearily.

18
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,569
'You're predictable too.

19
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,289
You've got too much money, that's your problem,
Dexter.

20
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,630
What you really mean is that you're running
away from real life.'

21
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,850
'Travelling broadens the mind, Emma,' he said
slowly.

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,050
He was trying to copy the girl's accent.

23
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,340
Suddenly, he leaned over her and kissed her.

24
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,750
'I think you're too broad-minded now,' the
girl said, quickly turning her face away from

25
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,230
him.

26
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,690
The girl was from Yorkshire, in the north
of England.

27
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,130
She was used to posh boys from the south making
fun of her soft northern accent.

28
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,470
Sometimes she didn't care, but now she suddenly
felt annoyed with the boy.

29
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,420
Everything was going wrong tonight.

30
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,440
'Anyway, I'm not talking about the immediate
future,' she told him.

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,909
'I'm not asking about tomorrow, I'm asking
what you want to be in twenty years from now.'

32
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,460
At first, the best answer he could think of
was 'I want to be rich and famous'.

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,460
But then he thought a bit more and spoke seriously.

34
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,070
'I don't ever want to be different from this,'
he said.

35
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,580
'I'd like to stay exactly as I am now.

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,370
Every fifteenth of July, I want to be just
like this.'

37
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,560
The girl was called Emma Morley.

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,260
The boy's name was Dexter Mayhew.

39
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,780
They were lying on the narrow bed in Emma's
room in a shared flat.

40
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,350
It was four o'clock in the morning.

41
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,400
The two young people didn't know each other
very well, but certainly this was a night

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,030
for thinking about the future.

43
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,170
It was the last night of their university
life in Edinburgh.

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,040
Earlier in the day, after four years, they
had finally graduated.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,650
Soon they would go in separate directions.

46
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,939
Emma looked up at the boy as he leaned over
her.

47
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,430
She was a little annoyed with him, but she
still thought that he was handsome.

48
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,730
'Mm - handsome.

49
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,890
Perhaps "beautiful" is a better word,' she
thought.

50
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:05,140
And she knew that lots of the other girl students
agreed with her - especially the posh ones

51
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,580
from the south.

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,640
They all knew that he would get their clothes
off and get them into his bed.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,269
His body was muscular and the skin of his
face was tight.

54
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,980
His eyebrows were slim and his lips were full.

55
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:27,260
'Yes, he's beautiful, but he looks a little
like a cat,' Emma told herself.

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,630
'I think I can imagine you when you're forty,'
she said unkindly.

57
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,690
'You'll have an expensive red sports car and
live in the most expensive part of London.

58
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,800
You'll be married to your third wife - no,
I'm wrong, your fourth wife.

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,700
There won't be any children.

60
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,200
You're too selfish for children.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,400
No children, just three expensive divorces.'

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,900
'Well, Em,' Dexter began crossly.

63
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,300
'Who's "Em"?'

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,940
Emma quickly asked.

65
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,290
'Your friends call you "Em", I've heard them
call you that,' he said.

66
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,530
'Ah, yes, my friends call me that,' Emma replied.

67
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,400
'Can't I call you that?' he asked.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,930
He sounded worried.

69
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,600
'Oh, all right then, Dex,' she said.

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,670
'Go on.'

71
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,639
'Well, if you think I'm so terrible why are
you sleeping with me?' he asked.

72
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:34,630
'Well, I don't think I really have slept with
you, have I?' she replied.

73
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,170
'You can choose either meaning of "sleep"
- I mean, we haven't been to sleep and we

74
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,750
haven't done anything else, have we?'

75
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,130
'No,' the boy said, 'no, we haven't quite
done that.'

76
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,330
Tonight Emma had wanted something different.

77
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,030
She wasn't sure what it was, but their names
sounded good together.

78
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,650
'Emma and Dexter,' she thought.

79
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,530
'Em and Dex.'

80
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,669
'Wait there,' Emma said.

81
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,600
'I'm just going to the bathroom.

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,220
Don't go away.'

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,200
She put on her thick glasses and walked towards
the door.

84
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,889
In the bathroom, Emma asked herself why she
was being difficult with the boy.

85
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:28,480
'He's certainly very bourgeois and he isn't
very clever, but I really like him,' she told

86
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,340
herself.

87
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,520
Emma had liked Dexter since she'd first met
him at a party two years before.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,130
But she'd never got to know him and in just
a few hours he would be gone.

89
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,680
And he certainly wasn't going to ask her to
go to China with him.

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,470
It was a bit sad.

91
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,440
For the first time in four years she was with
a boy she really liked.

92
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,270
But she couldn't relax with him.

93
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,650
They had been kissing and talking for eight
hours now and she still didn't know what she

94
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,090
wanted.

95
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,260
Dexter, waiting in the bedroom, looked around
him.

96
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,740
He had been in so many rooms like this one
- rooms where girls like Emma lived.

97
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,729
These girls always wore t-shirts with political
slogans on the fronts.

98
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,210
There were always political posters on their
walls.

99
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,770
There were always CDs of political songs.

100
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,570
They were all the same, these girls with socialist
ideas.

101
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:35,889
They always thought that he was horribly bourgeois
and they always thought that being bourgeois

102
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,050
was bad.

103
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,280
Well, he had news for them.

104
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,360
He thought that being bourgeois was just fine.

105
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,770
Dexter hadn't really decided yet on a map
for his future life.

106
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,550
But he was twenty-three years old and he had
some ambitions.

107
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,600
He wanted to be successful at something - he
just didn't know at what.

108
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,140
He wanted to make his parents proud of him.

109
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,770
He wanted to meet lots of women.

110
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,570
He wanted to have lots of fun in his life
and he wanted never to be sad.

111
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,039
Thinking about fun and sadness, Dexter was
now feeling that this night had been a mistake.

112
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
There were going to be tears.

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,289
There were going to be angry phone calls.

114
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:28,250
Emma returned and lay down beside him again.

115
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,250
She had put on a t-shirt with a political
slogan on the front.

116
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,399
'Do you mind if we just cuddle, Dex?'

117
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,940
Emma said.

118
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,479
Dexter didn't think this was a good idea at
all, but he didn't say so.

119
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,649
'OK, if that's what you want,' he said, without
interest.

120
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:54,310
'I can't believe I just said "cuddle",' Emma
said, after a minute of silence.

121
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,310
'What a terrible bourgeois word for me to
use!

122
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm sorry.'

123
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,420
'We must get some sleep,' said Dexter.

124
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,130
He was thinking, 'This must never happen again.'

125
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,290
There was daylight outside the window.

126
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,990
Dexter was still awake and he was looking
at Emma, who was sleeping next to him.

127
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,140
'I could leave quietly now, before she wakes
up,' he told himself.

128
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,230
'Then I don't need to see her again.

129
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,010
Will she mind?

130
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,380
Probably, girls usually do mind.

131
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,800
But will I mind?'

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,870
It was strange, but the answer to this was
not clear to Dexter.

133
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,180
There was something about Emma.

134
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,980
She was pretty, but she seemed to hate herself
for that.

135
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,630
The red colour of her hair was out of a bottle
and her hairstyle was awful.

136
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,940
Dexter guessed that Emma's hair had been cut
by Tilly Killick, the large, noisy girl who

137
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,110
lived in the other room in this flat.

138
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,240
'But never mind the hair,' Dexter thought.

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,690
'Her face is really pretty and her body's
amazing.'

140
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:11,220
Soon he decided that he would leave quietly,
never mind what Emma's face and body were

141
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
like.

142
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,150
'I'll probably never see her again,' he told
himself.

143
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,260
Dexter was about to get quietly out of bed
when Emma woke up.

144
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,880
'What are you doing later today?'

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,580
she asked, sleepily.

146
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,880
'Tell her you're busy!' said a voice in Dexter's
head.

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,350
'I don't have any plans,' he said aloud.

148
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,880
'Shall we do something together then?'

149
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,060
she asked.

150
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,420
'Yes, all right,' Dexter said.

151
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:59,890
A moment later, Emma was asleep again.

152
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,760
CHAPTER TWO
Real Life

153
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,690
Saturday, 15th July 1989

154
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,540
Wolverhampton, England and Rome, Italy

155
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,410
Emma Morley was writing a letter.

156
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,600
Stoke Park School, Wolverhampton

157
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Hello Dexter,

158
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
How are you?

159
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
How is Rome?

160
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,120
How is La Dolce Vita?

161
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
(Try a dictionary!)

162
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,380
I know that some people call Rome 'the eternal
city' but I've been here in Wolverhampton

163
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,580
for two days now and they have felt eternal
to me.

164
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,350
So perhaps Wolverhampton should be called
by that name.

165
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,580
Ha ha.

166
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,320
Well, I decided to take the job I told you
about, so I'm working with Sledgehammer Theatre.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,269
It's a Theatre-in-Education group.

168
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:58,610
For the past month, we've been touring schools
with a play about slavery.

169
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,510
Today we're performing it at this fine school.

170
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,450
Anyway, we try to show 11-13-year olds that
slavery was A BAD THING.

171
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,730
Aren't we brave and original!

172
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,390
Really, I don't know why I am being nasty
about my job.

173
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,240
A lot of the kids have never thought about
social problems of the past until now.

174
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,200
And now some of them - the ones that don't
throw things at us - are becoming really interested.

175
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,350
So I still think that we can make a difference
for people.

176
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,770
Emma was trying to be positive.

177
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,750
She had to try hard.

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,670
The last year had been full of mistakes.

179
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,340
After her graduation, she had stayed on in
Edinburgh.

180
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,180
But she had made a series of bad career choices.

181
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,420
There was the terrible all-girl band she had
played in.

182
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,860
There was her first novel, which she had stopped
writing.

183
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,790
There was her second novel, which she had
also stopped writing.

184
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,010
She had worked in shops, trying to sell things
to tourists.

185
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,279
But the tourists never really wanted the things
she tried to sell them.

186
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,770
So finally she had moved back to Yorkshire
to live with her parents.

187
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,540
That wasn't good either.

188
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,310
'But you've got a really good degree,' Emma's
mother said almost daily.

189
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,820
'Why on earth don't you use it to get yourself
a good job?'

190
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,880
From time to time, Dexter Mayhew became part
of her life for a few days.

191
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,170
At the end of the summer, she had gone to
stay at his rich parents' huge house in the

192
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,170
countryside.

193
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,110
But that had gone terribly wrong.

194
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,420
Emma had had too much to drink one evening
and had argued with Dexter's father about

195
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,300
politics.

196
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,589
She had shouted at him and told him he was
a bourgeois fascist.

197
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:05,850
Then, more recently, they had met up in London
for the birthday party of one of their friends

198
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,340
- a man called Callum O'Neill.

199
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,990
Callum had shared a flat with Dexter in Edinburgh.

200
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,260
He now had a successful business selling computers.

201
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,980
Dexter and Emma had spent the day after the
party together.

202
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,029
Most of the day they lay on the grass in Kensington
Gardens.

203
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,350
They drank wine from a bottle and they talked.

204
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:37,010
They never quite touched each other and Dexter
told her all about a wonderful Spanish girl

205
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,690
called Lola.

206
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,070
Emma decided that this was all their friendship
was ever going to be.

207
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,660
Clearly, Dexter didn't want to sleep with
her.

208
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,829
He wanted to tell her about the other girls
he slept with.

209
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:57,170
But strangely, Dexter also told her that his
mother had liked her very much.

210
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,430
'She says she has a good feeling about you
and me,' he'd said.

211
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:08,100
At the time, Emma hadn't understood the importance
of Dexter's words.

212
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,330
Emma didn't know that Dexter loved his mother
more than anyone in the world.

213
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,110
And she didn't know that Dexter's mother felt
the same about him.

214
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,220
Then Dexter had gone travelling again.

215
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,700
When he was away, Emma wrote him long letters.

216
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,460
He usually replied on postcards.

217
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,700
'We're just pen pals now,' Emma told herself.

218
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,040
'We'll never be anything more to each other.'

219
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,390
Emma got a job in a pub for a while, but living
with her parents was killing her mind.

220
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,240
When an old friend phoned and offered her
a job in his theatre group, she'd accepted

221
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
it immediately.

222
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,889
But now, after three months, Emma hated the
theatre group.

223
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,329
'I don't want to be here making a difference,'
she thought.

224
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:59,820
'I want to be in Rome.

225
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,040
I want to be with Dexter Mayhew.'

226
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,970
Emma made herself continue with her letter.

227
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,350
Anyway, I've got a new plan.

228
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,560
I've written a two-woman play about Virginia
Woolf and Emily Dickinson.

229
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,970
One of my friends from the theatre group and
I want to find somewhere in London where we

230
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,399
can stage it.

231
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,790
Do you remember my friend Tilly Killick?

232
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,920
We shared a flat in Edinburgh.

233
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,430
She lives in London now and she has a spare
room in her flat.

234
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,269
So I'll probably live there for a few months.

235
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,600
Are you coming back to London soon?

236
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,639
Maybe we could be flat mates?

237
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,190
Emma stopped writing.

238
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,550
Suddenly she felt nervous.

239
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,560
Then she wrote: It's all right, I'm just joking!

240
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,700
But I really miss you, Dex.

241
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,829
And she signed her name.

242
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,420
In Rome, Dexter was out with a Danish girl.

243
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,339
He was working as an English teacher and the
girl was one of his students.

244
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,040
She was nineteen.

245
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,240
'I have an exam on Monday,' the girl said.

246
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
'Test me on verbs, please, Dexter.'

247
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,010
'All right - the present continuous,' Dexter
replied.

248
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:26,709
'I am kissing, you are kissing, he is kissing...'
said the girl.

249
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,799
She showed him how to kiss too.

250
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:36,500
'But what would Emma Morley think about this?'

251
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:48,539
Dexter suddenly thought.

252
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,700
CHAPTER THREE
The Taj Mahal

253
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,899
Sunday, 15th July 1990

254
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:03,549
Camden Town, London and Bombay, India

255
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:10,729
'The restaurant opens in ten minutes and I
have a few things to tell you.'

256
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:19,110
Scott was the manager of Loco Caliente, a
Tex-Mex restaurant in Camden Town, North London.

257
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,769
The restaurant was one of a chain.

258
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:27,809
'First, these are the special dishes for this
lunchtime,' Scott went on when his staff had

259
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,019
stopped talking.

260
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,260
'Today's special soup is corn chowder.'

261
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:39,169
Several of the waiters pretended to be sick
and he stopped talking again for a few seconds.

262
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:47,570
'And today's other special dish is "an amazing
fish burrito" which contains "delicious pieces

263
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,899
of cod and prawns".

264
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,519
That's how the document from headquarters
describes it, anyway - and those are the words

265
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,720
you must use too.'

266
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,039
'It sounds really horrible,' said one of the
waiters, laughing.

267
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,700
'Look at it this way - we're bringing a taste
of the North Atlantic to the beaches of Mexico,'

268
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,109
said Emma Morley.

269
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,399
She sounded very tired as she made the joke.

270
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:21,159
As she tied her waitress's apron round her
waist she noticed someone she hadn't seen

271
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,129
before - a large man with curly, blonde hair.

272
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,090
He was wearing a waiter's uniform and he was
quite nice-looking.

273
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,350
'And now here's some good news at last,' said
Scott.

274
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,179
He pointed at the stranger.

275
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,859
'This is Ian Whitehead, who is joining our
happy team.

276
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,659
Ian - this is Emma.

277
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:44,889
She'll look after you today.

278
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,729
She's been here longer than all the others.'

279
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,870
Emma did not think that this was anything
to be proud of.

280
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:59,159
She gave Ian a little smile as one of the
waiters turned on the lunchtime music.

281
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,580
The first song was, of course, 'La Cucaracha'.

282
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,440
She asked herself once more what she was doing
here.

283
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,039
She asked herself once more what she was going
to do with her life.

284
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:18,159
Later, when Emma was showing Ian what he should
do, she asked him about himself.

285
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,979
'I need to be in London,' he said.

286
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:25,489
'I took this job because I need to earn some
money on the side.'

287
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,489
'Why?

288
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:29,509
What do you really do?'

289
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:30,889
Emma asked.

290
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:36,890
'Well...' he said, in a funny accent, 'really,
I'm a comedian!'

291
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,720
'A comedian!

292
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,860
What kind of comedian?' asked Emma.

293
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,860
'I do stand-up comedy in the evenings.

294
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,059
I do gigs at small comedy clubs, but they
don't pay me very much.'

295
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,490
Then he surprised her.

296
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,489
He asked her to go on a date with him that
evening - to one of the clubs.

297
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:03,489
She was touched, but she refused.

298
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:07,279
In Bombay, Dexter Mayhew was writing a letter.

299
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,009
Emma, Emma, Emma.

300
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,450
How are you?

301
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,370
What are you doing?

302
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,409
I'm in Bombay and it's raining.

303
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,029
It rains here even harder than it rains in
Edinburgh.

304
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,779
It's too wet to go out so I'm staying in my
hotel room.

305
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:27,389
I'm a bit drunk, are you surprised?

306
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:34,399
I've seen some amazing things here in India
and I've taken thousands of photos.

307
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:39,529
I'll show all of them to you very, very slowly
when I get back.

308
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,799
I showed some of them to a TV producer I met
a few days ago.

309
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,220
She's from London but she's making a film
here.

310
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,429
I think she liked me - she wants me to call
her when I get back to England.

311
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,030
Maybe she'll have a job for me in TV!

312
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,090
I'll need to work soon and I'm banned from
teaching English to foreigners.

313
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,190
I'm not sorry about that, I hated it.

314
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,460
But I was treated very badly.

315
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,659
That Danish girl was twenty-one!

316
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:14,279
What are you doing now?

317
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,749
Are you still sharing a flat with Tilly?

318
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:20,749
Are you still working at that horrible restaurant?

319
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:23,190
You need to leave that job, Emma.

320
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,809
Listen to me, Emma!

321
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,629
We need to do something about your life.

322
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:33,399
I'm drunk at the moment, so I'm just going
to tell you what I think.

323
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,039
You are clever.

324
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,120
And you are beautiful.

325
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,470
And you are loveable.

326
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,919
And you are SEXY!

327
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,750
You should be CONFIDENT!

328
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,690
I want to take you away from boring people
like Tilly Killick and Callum O'Neill, the

329
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,690
computer king.

330
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,139
Would you like to live with me when I get
back to England?

331
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:01,269
We would just be flatmates, of course.

332
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,879
Now, here's my plan to change your life.

333
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,399
Are you sitting down?

334
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:10,029
The shock might knock you over!

335
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,200
You should be here with me in India.

336
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,450
I'm going to wire you some money.

337
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,590
I've always wanted to wire someone some money
- it will make me feel important.

338
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,109
Use the money to buy a plane ticket to Delhi.

339
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:30,099
Then take a train to Agra and go to the Taj
Mahal.

340
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,149
Have you heard of it?

341
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:36,221
It's a big white building and it's named after
that Indian restaurant on the Lothian Road

342
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,221
in Edinburgh.

343
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:42,679
Be there exactly at noon on 1st August.

344
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,320
Stand under the dome with a red rose in your
hand.

345
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,929
I'll find you.

346
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,269
I'll be carrying a white rose.

347
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:57,179
Isn't that the greatest plan you've ever heard
in your life?

348
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:02,070
Well, Emma, I'm still drunk, but it's stopped
raining.

349
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,999
I'm going out now to meet some Dutch people
in a bar.

350
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:07,330
I met them earlier today.

351
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,690
They're all girls.

352
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,470
They're nice.

353
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,279
Don't forget - the Taj Mahal at noon on 1st
August.

354
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,289
I'll find you.

355
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:25,090
After he had finished the letter, Dexter took
a cold shower and soon he was feeling better.

356
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,990
He was almost sober now.

357
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,861
As he was dressing, he saw the letter, lying
on his bed.

358
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,149
Should he send it?

359
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,039
Suddenly he felt nervous.

360
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,349
He'd called Emma clever and beautiful.

361
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,379
He'd called her loveable.

362
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,429
He'd called her sexy!

363
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,960
He'd asked her to live with him.

364
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,159
Would she be angry with him?

365
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,859
Would she come to India?

366
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:54,379
Did he really want to see her that much?

367
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,499
He decided that he did.

368
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:00,000
He decided that he would post the letter that
evening.

369
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,059
He put it in his pocket and he went out.

370
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:10,929
Then he walked happily to the bar where his
new friends were waiting.

371
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,879
At about nine o'clock that evening Dexter
left the bar with one of his Dutch friends

372
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,499
- her name was Renee.

373
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:23,169
As they left, they bumped into a large German
girl with a huge backpack.

374
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,099
She was a student from Cologne and she was
called Heidi.

375
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:34,799
She was tired and cross, and she swore quietly
at Dexter - it had been a long day.

376
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,130
She crossed the room and sat down heavily
on the sofa where Dexter had been sitting.

377
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,830
A few minutes later she moved sideways across
the sofa and felt something hard pressing

378
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,619
into her leg.

379
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,679
She swore again.

380
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,719
There was an envelope between the cushions
of the sofa.

381
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:58,149
She pulled it out and looked at it.

382
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:04,139
Heidi opened the envelope and took out the
letter.

383
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:06,669
She read it to the end.

384
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:11,630
Her English wasn't very good, but she understood
most of the letter.

385
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,179
She realized that it was important.

386
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,299
It was the kind of letter she wanted someone
to write to her.

387
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,649
It was a beautiful letter.

388
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:24,899
She wanted this person called Emma to receive
it.

389
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:28,359
But there was no name written on the envelope.

390
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,399
And there was no address written on the letter.

391
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:34,960
What could she do?

392
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:55,049
Sadly, she realized there was nothing she
could do.

393
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,690
CHAPTER FOUR
A Career Opportunity

394
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,649
Monday, 15th July 1991

395
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:06,590
Camden Town and Primrose Hill, London

396
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,499
'Listen to me, please, everyone,' Scott McKenzie
shouted.

397
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:16,369
'The restaurant opens in ten minutes and I
have some things to tell you.

398
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,779
First, these are the special dishes for this
lunchtime.'

399
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:27,519
Scott stopped, looked around him and then
went on when his staff had stopped talking.

400
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,279
'Today's special soup is corn chowder.

401
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,279
And the special burrito is turkey.'

402
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,219
'Turkey's not a good idea in July,' said Ian
Whitehead wearily.

403
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:45,330
'Turkey's really for Christmas.'

404
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,470
He shook his head in despair.

405
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,349
This made Emma Morley laugh.

406
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,999
Ian was now Emma's best friend, but she rarely
laughed at what he said.

407
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:58,409
Scott looked at the two of them.

408
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,990
'Ian, you can clean the toilets today,' Scott
said.

409
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,320
'Emma, I need to talk to you in my office.'

410
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Emma followed the manager into his office
and sat down.

411
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,349
'I'll come straight to the point,' Scott said.

412
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,029
'I'm leaving Loco Caliente soon.

413
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm going to be the manager of a big, new
restaurant in West London.

414
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,919
Do you want to be the manager here when I
go?

415
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,299
It's a good career opportunity.

416
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:33,440
Head office wants someone who isn't going
anywhere.

417
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,349
Someone who won't go away travelling or leave
suddenly to start a more exciting job.'

418
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:42,350
And suddenly, Emma was crying.

419
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,330
'What's wrong, Emma?'

420
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,649
Scott asked.

421
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:48,289
'Has somebody upset you?'

422
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,599
'No, it's all right, Scott.

423
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,700
It's really nothing,' Emma told him.

424
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,869
'Don't worry, I'll be fine in a minute.'

425
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:02,470
'Go and rest in the staffroom,' said Scott
kindly.

426
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,619
'Give me your answer about the job tomorrow.'

427
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:10,099
A few minutes later Emma was alone in the
staffroom.

428
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,339
She looked around her in despair.

429
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:15,879
She knew that she couldn't leave her job.

430
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:20,980
She had to spend all her money on rent, so
she needed to take the manager's job.

431
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,749
But she didn't want to be a restaurant manager
all her life.

432
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:31,609
She still wanted to be a writer, or perhaps
a film-maker, or a painter.

433
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,379
She wanted to be something in the arts.

434
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:42,559
She spent lots of time writing - she mostly
wrote poems these days.

435
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,559
But nothing was working well for her.

436
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,429
Nobody wanted to publish her poems.

437
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,940
Emma knew that her mother was still trying
to find jobs for her in Yorkshire.

438
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,210
Some days, she thought she would go back there.

439
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,330
'I've had a battle with London and London
has won,' she told herself.

440
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,750
But she wasn't ready to stop fighting yet.

441
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,409
She needed to be in London.

442
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,610
Emma opened her handbag and took out her special
notebook.

443
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,889
The book had a beautiful cover and lovely,
thick, white paper.

444
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:23,070
It was where Emma wrote her poems.

445
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,960
Now she took out her best pen.

446
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,589
She thought for minute, then she started to
write a new poem about how she felt.

447
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:38,610
The poem she wrote was quite short and she
knew it was really bad.

448
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,429
She turned back through the pages of the book
and found an earlier poem called Daybreak

449
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:45,429
in Edinburgh.

450
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:46,429
She read it.

451
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:48,679
We lie here in the

452
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,289
Narrow bed and talk

453
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,289
About the future.

454
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,289
I

455
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:55,809
Look at him and think

456
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,749
'Handsome' - stupid word - and I

457
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:00,509
Ask myself the

458
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,690
Hardest question,

459
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,940
'Might it be the real

460
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,460
Thing, this time?

461
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,510
Outside the birds begin to sing and

462
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,309
Sunlight warms the curtain.

463
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:15,809
Emma looked carefully at what she had written.

464
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:23,869
'Can I really make the bad things in my life
seem better by writing about them?' she wondered.

465
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:29,380
She had just decided that she could not do
that because that poem was rubbish too, when

466
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,049
Ian came into the staffroom.

467
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:35,119
Ian looked angry and unhappy.

468
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:41,059
'Emma,' he said, 'your friend is in the restaurant
again the handsome one.

469
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:43,169
He wants to see you.

470
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,700
He's with a girl a different one this time.'

471
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,980
Ian had seen several of Dexter's girlfriends.

472
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,309
Dexter obviously liked to show them to Emma
and this clearly upset her.

473
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,580
It upset Ian too.

474
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,989
'He's a monster, Emma,' Ian said.

475
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:07,089
'No, he's not a monster, he's just an idiot.'

476
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:11,350
Emma sighed and went out into the restaurant.

477
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:17,489
Dexter was with a tall, thin girl with black
hair and expensive black clothes.

478
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:22,269
They were reading the menu aloud to each other
and laughing about it.

479
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:23,610
'Hello, Emma!'

480
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,589
Dexter said when he saw her.

481
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:28,679
'This is Naomi.

482
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,249
Will you have a drink with us?'

483
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,549
His voice told Emma that he was drunk.

484
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:39,099
'I can't do that, Dex, I'm working,' Emma
replied.

485
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,099
'Goodbye.'

486
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,489
She turned away and walked back to the staffroom.

487
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:49,879
Later, before leaving the restaurant, Dexter
left a handwritten note on his table.

488
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:56,029
Later in the day, after Emma had finished
work, she found Dexter lying on the grass

489
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:57,929
on Primrose Hill, a mile away.

490
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:02,730
The evening sun was warm and he was almost
asleep.

491
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,630
A half-empty wine bottle told her the reason.

492
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,870
Emma kicked his leg.

493
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,210
'Don't do that to me, Dexter,' she said angrily.

494
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,239
'Don't bring people into the restaurant to
laugh at me.

495
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:22,159
If you ever do that again, it's the end of
our friendship.'

496
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,610
'I'm sorry, Em,' Dexter said.

497
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,419
'I'm really sorry.

498
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:28,820
I apologize.'

499
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Emma looked at him and decided that he meant
what he said - for now.

500
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,610
She sat down beside him.

501
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:42,570
'Won't your girlfriend be angry if she finds
out that you left a note asking me to meet

502
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,570
you?'

503
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,570
she asked.

504
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,879
'Oh, Naomi isn't really my girlfriend,' Dexter
replied happily.

505
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,850
'She's just someone I go out with sometimes.'

506
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,789
'I'm sorry, then,' said Emma.

507
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:01,379
'Clearly, I don't mean girlfriend, I mean
victim.'

508
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,839
She spoke sadly.

509
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,050
And she thought, 'Em and Dex, Dex and Em.

510
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,980
No, it's never going to happen now.'

511
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,640
She picked up the bottle of wine and drank
from it.

512
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,480
Dexter looked at her and he felt warm inside.

513
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,159
He often thought that Emma Morley was the
best person he'd ever known.

514
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,589
But he'd never really told her that.

515
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:33,339
And he didn't tell her that now.

516
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:54,419
For some reason, he couldn't make himself
tell her that.

517
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,250
CHAPTER FIVE
The Rules

518
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,680
Wednesday, 15th July 1992

519
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,769
The Greek islands

520
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:10,450
Dexter and Emma were lying sleepily on the
deck of a small ferry.

521
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:16,900
The two friends were travelling from the Greek
island of Rhodes to a smaller island.

522
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,410
They were going to stay there for a week and
they were both feeling happy.

523
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,609
Life was changing for them.

524
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:31,599
After a year as manager at Loco Caliente,
Emma had left her job.

525
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,480
In September she was going to start a college
course.

526
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,490
She was going to train to be a schoolteacher.

527
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,089
And Dexter had a job now.

528
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,380
He was working for a television company.

529
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:52,310
He'd started with small responsibilities - making
the tea, doing research for producers.

530
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,660
But now he was working as an interviewer.

531
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:03,090
He interviewed pop stars and actors on a programme
called The Bigger Picture.

532
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,359
He had a posh flat in Belsize Park - an expensive
part of north London.

533
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,920
He wore expensive designer clothes.

534
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,299
And he had a new girlfriend, his fourth one
after Naomi.

535
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:22,230
She was a beautiful and successful model.

536
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:29,210
Emma didn't really enjoy Dexter's television
appearances, but she always watched them.

537
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:35,640
For The Bigger Picture, Dexter had invented
a new character for himself.

538
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,290
He was a 'man of the people'.

539
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:44,660
When he interviewed pop stars and actors,
he spoke with a cockney accent.

540
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,700
Emma had never enjoyed Dexter's version of
a Yorkshire accent and she thought that his

541
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,180
'cockney' voice was even worse.

542
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:59,019
Emma liked Dexter to know that she wasn't
impressed by his television career.

543
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:02,099
She told him this often.

544
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:04,180
But all that was back in London.

545
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,079
Today they were happy.

546
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,680
Today, they were on a ferry among the beautiful
Greek islands.

547
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,650
They were on holiday together.

548
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,829
It had been surprisingly easy to arrange this
trip.

549
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:24,420
Dexter's girlfriend was very self-confident,
so she had no problems about his holiday with

550
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,720
another woman.

551
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,270
And Emma occasionally slept with people but
still didn't have a regular boyfriend.

552
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:38,809
So they had made their plans together and
they had decided on some rules of behaviour

553
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,710
for the holiday.

554
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,640
The Rules:

555
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,539
One: Separate bedrooms.

556
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:49,440
Two: No flirting.

557
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,309
Three: No sleeping together.

558
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:56,210
Four: No nudity.

559
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,079
Five: No board games.

560
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,880
Emma had decided on the first four rules.

561
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,540
Dexter had fought back with Rule Five.

562
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,529
Emma enjoyed playing board games, but Dexter
hated them.

563
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:20,970
The Rules had to be obeyed, Emma told herself
now, lying sleepily on the deck of the ferry.

564
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,089
The Rules made this holiday possible.

565
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:27,859
But Emma wondered if Dexter was going to be
able to obey them.

566
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,190
And she wondered if she was going to be able
to obey them.

567
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,470
They were half asleep when they heard an English
voice.

568
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:39,140
'It's him,' said a man.

569
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,819
'He's on TV on Fridays.'

570
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,020
'Oh, yes,' said a girl.

571
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,369
'He's called Dexter something.

572
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:51,660
You are that man who's on TV, aren't you?'

573
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,540
She was speaking to Dexter now.

574
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,349
And he was wide awake.

575
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:58,349
'Yep.

576
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:03,140
On 'oliday, are ya?' said Dexter in his pretend-cockney
accent.

577
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,589
'Yeah,' said the girl.

578
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:11,720
Dexter continued talking to her and didn't
take any notice of the man.

579
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,769
The girl was clearly impressed.

580
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:19,880
'Dexter, why do you speak like that?'

581
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,950
Emma asked when the couple had gone.

582
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:27,470
'You aren't a Londoner and you went to Winchester
College.'

583
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:34,640
'The TV viewers won't connect with me if I
don't seem like them,' Dexter explained.

584
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,460
'Not many of our viewers went to Winchester.'

585
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,920
'That's a very bad reason,' said Emma.

586
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,650
'And you've broken Rule Two already.

587
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,630
You were flirting with that girl.'

588
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:55,130
Emma was sitting at a table outside a small
cafe on the island and drinking coffee.

589
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,640
Dexter had gone to find them somewhere to
stay.

590
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,980
'Don't forget, we need two rooms,' Emma had
shouted after him as he set off.

591
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,950
And he'd looked back at her and shouted, 'Of
course we do!'

592
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,500
'She looks so lovely these days,' he told
himself.

593
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,800
'It's the contact lenses.

594
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,460
I hated those thick glasses she used to wear.

595
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,230
But now she looks great.

596
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,539
These rules aren't going to make life easy.'

597
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:34,859
But an hour later, when he returned to the
cafe, Dexter seemed very pleased.

598
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,530
'There's some bad news, Emma,' he said.

599
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,710
'I could only find one room on the island.

600
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,800
It's a wonderful room, but it only has one
bed.

601
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,980
But it's a very large bed.'

602
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:56,290
Emma believed that Dexter hadn't tried to
find two rooms.

603
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,299
She believed that Dexter had never meant to
find two rooms.

604
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,730
And of course, she was correct.

605
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,050
'All right, let's go and see the room,' Emma
said wearily.

606
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,539
But when they got there, Emma loved the room.

607
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,270
The bed was a large one.

608
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,069
And there was a balcony.

609
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:21,779
They could stand on it and look out over the
sea.

610
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:26,849
'The room is fine, Dexter,' Emma said.

611
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,029
'We'll stay here.

612
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:34,769
And you'll stay on your own side of the bed,
won't you?'

613
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:38,109
Late that evening, Dexter and Emma walked
down to the beach.

614
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:43,759
The sun had disappeared and no one else was
there.

615
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,700
'Shall we swim, Emma?'

616
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,700
Dexter said.

617
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,029
By now, Emma could read Dexter's mind.

618
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:51,870
She could almost hear it working.

619
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:58,579
This wasn't difficult, because Dexter only
thought about a small number of things.

620
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:07,440
'We don't have swimsuits with us,' Emma replied
very slowly, speaking in the way people speak

621
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,890
to young children.

622
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,950
'We don't need swimsuits.

623
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,369
There's no one here,' Dexter said.

624
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:16,599
'I understand you too well, Dex,' Emma said.

625
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:22,430
'You just want to get my clothes off, don't
you?'

626
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,740
Dexter was silent.

627
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,359
'You swim if you want to, Dexter,' Emma went
on.

628
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,640
'I'm not going to show my body to the world.

629
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,559
And you've forgotten Rule Four.'

630
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,079
A moment later, Dexter had taken off all his
clothes and was running into the sea.

631
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,960
Emma suddenly felt stupid.

632
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,609
'Why can't I be free and uncomplicated like
Dexter?'

633
00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:53,490
she asked herself.

634
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,890
'Why do I care who sees me?'

635
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:03,089
She quickly took off her own clothes and she
too ran naked into the sea.

636
00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:06,769
Soon she was standing next to her friend.

637
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:09,530
He turned to face her.

638
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,770
'Can we talk about Rule Three, Em?'

639
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,690
Dexter said gently.

640
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,010
'You see, I really want you.'

641
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,760
For a moment, Emma felt wonderful.

642
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,960
He had said it at last.

643
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,700
And it was going to happen, here and now,
in the beautiful warm sea.

644
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,150
Dex and Em, Em and Dex.

645
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,670
It was going to happen.

646
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,930
And then Dexter said the wrong thing.

647
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,450
'Of course, it isn't personal.

648
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,740
I want nearly every woman that I meet,' he
added.

649
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,759
'That's my problem.

650
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:55,450
I can't escape it.

651
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,150
It's like a nightmare!'

652
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,190
'Oh, poor Dexter,' Emma said angrily.

653
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,240
'I feel really sorry for you.'

654
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,890
She was angry with Dexter and she was angry
with herself.

655
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,530
'You're a stupid, stupid woman,' she told
herself.

656
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,779
'You're stupid for thinking that he really
cared about you.'

657
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:23,029
But a moment later, it was Dexter who was
angry.

658
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:26,019
He was looking over Emma's shoulder at the
beach.

659
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:30,390
A boy was stealing his clothes.

660
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,390
'Stop!

661
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,770
Don't do that!'

662
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,430
Dexter shouted.

663
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,680
He started to run towards the beach.

664
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:43,430
'Those trousers cost me two hundred pounds!'
he shouted at Emma, who was laughing.

665
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:50,829
When they reached the beach, the boy, and
Dexter's expensive clothes, had disappeared.

666
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:54,690
He hadn't taken Emma's clothes.

667
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:01,359
When she had stopped laughing, Emma got dressed
and Dexter found a torn, blue, plastic bag

668
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,200
on the beach.

669
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,720
He held this in front of him as they ran back
to their room.

670
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,760
On the way, they passed the English couple
they had met on the ferry.

671
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,549
'I like the bag,' the man said.

672
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:19,020
'It's a great colour.'

673
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,650
He laughed mockingly.

674
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,819
Dexter didn't reply.

675
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:27,029
But when they got back to their room, Dexter's
anger had gone.

676
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:29,529
It was a beautiful evening.

677
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:34,620
And soon, the stars were bright in the sky.

678
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,829
He and Emma had some food, then they got into
the bed and lay in the dark.

679
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:46,589
They didn't touch each other, and they knew
that their friendship was unchanged.

680
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:50,619
'Tell me a secret, Em,' Dexter said.

681
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:54,880
'Tell me something about yourself that I don't
know.'

682
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,069
'Well, I don't want to make you more arrogant
than you already are,' Emma replied.

683
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:05,119
'But here's something you didn't know.

684
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,990
Before I first talked to you, when we were
students, I was in love with you.

685
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,140
And I used to write poems about you.'

686
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,180
'That was before you knew me,' Dexter said.

687
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,751
'Aren't you in love with me now?'

688
00:46:20,751 --> 00:46:29,119
'Oh, now - things are quite different now,'
said Emma.

689
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,579
When she said that, Dexter started thinking
about his own secrets.

690
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:38,519
He'd never told Emma that he'd once slept
with Tilly Killick.

691
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:43,280
It had happened when he was visiting the flat
Emma and Tilly shared.

692
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,630
Emma had gone out to the shops for an hour.

693
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,250
He was never going to tell her about that.

694
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:57,190
He didn't know that Emma knew about it already
and it wasn't a secret at all.

695
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:03,589
'Tell me about those poems,' Dexter said quietly,
after a few minutes.

696
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:06,549
'What rhymed with Dexter?'

697
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:08,829
'Monster,' Emma replied quickly.

698
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:11,680
'It's a half-rhyme.'

699
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:19,170
'Em,' Dexter said a few minutes later, 'how
many rules did I break today?'

700
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,809
'Three,' Emma said.

701
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:23,960
'You broke Rules One, Two and Four.'

702
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:29,130
'And we nearly broke Rule Three,' Dexter thought.

703
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,119
'But we have eight more days.

704
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,130
Anything can happen in eight days.'

705
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:40,269
'Well, at least we didn't play any board games,'
he said aloud.

706
00:47:40,269 --> 00:48:02,510
Emma was asleep.

707
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,640
CHAPTER SIX
Poison

708
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,099
Thursday, 15th July 1993

709
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,140
Belsize Park, London and Oxfordshire

710
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,570
Dexter Mayhew was sitting in his flat in Belsize
Park.

711
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,690
It was 10 AM and Dexter was very drunk.

712
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:29,299
He had been drinking all night with some new
friends.

713
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:34,829
Now that he worked in television, lots of
people wanted to know Dexter.

714
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:39,579
They all wanted to hear his stories about
the famous people that he interviewed.

715
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:42,210
They all wanted to drink with him.

716
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,309
So he was often drunk these days.

717
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:50,690
Usually, being drunk in the mornings didn't
matter.

718
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,400
Dexter worked in the afternoons and evenings
and he was always sober by then.

719
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:02,680
But this morning, the morning of 15th July,
it mattered very much.

720
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,619
Today he had to go to his parents' house in
the country, in Oxfordshire.

721
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:09,660
He was already late.

722
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,880
He knew, in part of his mind, that he wanted
to be late.

723
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,829
In fact, in that part of his mind, he didn't
want to go at all.

724
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:25,900
Because today, thinking about his parents
made him want to scream.

725
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:33,950
Dexter's mother, at forty-nine, was fifteen
years younger than his father.

726
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,420
Dexter liked his father and they usually got
on well together.

727
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,900
But his feelings about his mother were quite
different.

728
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,920
Dexter loved his mother more than anyone in
the world.

729
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,690
But now his mother was dying and Dexter knew
that she couldn't live much longer.

730
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,930
He needed to see her, but he was afraid.

731
00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:00,180
He was afraid to see how close to death she
was.

732
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,700
So this morning, he needed to be strong.

733
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,660
He needed to make himself drive to his childhood
home.

734
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,980
And he needed to make himself behave normally
when he got there.

735
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:19,240
Dexter looked at the large parcel, wrapped
in brightly coloured paper, which he'd put

736
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,599
next to his front door.

737
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,200
He'd put it there so that he wouldn't forget
it when he went out, even if he was drunk.

738
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:33,160
The parcel was a present for his mother from
his good friend Emma Morley.

739
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,220
Emma and his mother were very different people,
but when they had met they had always enjoyed

740
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,369
each other's company.

741
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:47,590
And Stephen and Alison Mayhew had guessed
that Emma was a good friend to their son.

742
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:55,890
They hadn't really been offended at all when
Emma called Stephen 'a bourgeois fascist'.

743
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,710
Remembering this, for a moment Dexter wanted
to phone Emma.

744
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:07,690
The two of them had still never touched each
other, but he knew that she was his best friend.

745
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,619
Suddenly, he wanted to tell her that she was
a dear, wonderful person.

746
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:19,420
And he wanted to tell her how unhappy he was
about his mother's terrible illness.

747
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,660
But he knew what Emma would say.

748
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:28,250
'She'll know I'm drunk as soon as I start
to speak,' he told himself.

749
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,980
'She'll tell me that I mustn't drive.'

750
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,660
Dexter picked up his car keys and collected
Emma's parcel.

751
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:43,319
He locked the door of his flat behind him
and walked to his expensive, green sports

752
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:46,130
car.

753
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:50,119
An hour later, Dexter was still worrying about
his dying mother.

754
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,420
But he also knew that he was lucky to be alive
himself.

755
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,579
He had fallen asleep for a moment and had
almost crashed his car into a big truck.

756
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:07,089
He could still hear the noise of the truck's
horn in his aching head.

757
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:13,170
He wasn't far from his parents' house now,
but he had to stop for a while.

758
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,839
He slowed down and drove into a pub cark park.

759
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:21,349
It was a pub which he had often visited when
he was young.

760
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:27,400
He bought a glass of vodka and a glass of
beer and sat down.

761
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,420
He drank quickly and soon he was feeling better.

762
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,880
He walked outside into the sunlight and got
into his car.

763
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,499
In less than twenty minutes, he parked in
front of his parents' house, just as his father

764
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:45,529
opened the front door.

765
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:52,099
'I'd hoped you were coming earlier,' his father
said as Dexter got out of the car.

766
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:58,580
He looked angry and when Dexter tried to kiss
him on the cheeks, he moved quickly away.

767
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,680
At the television studios, everyone kissed
everyone else on the cheeks.

768
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,500
Dexter had forgotten for a moment that his
father lived in a different world.

769
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,880
'Your mother hoped you were coming earlier
too,' Stephen Mayhew added.

770
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,990
He looked carefully at his son, then he sighed
deeply.

771
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,359
'I'm sorry - I'm so sorry,' Dexter said unhappily.

772
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,790
'How is she, Dad?'

773
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:30,109
'You need to ask her that yourself,' Mr Mayhew
said.

774
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:33,309
'Go up to her room now.

775
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:36,549
I'll make us some lunch.'

776
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:40,749
Dexter walked slowly up the stairs, carrying
Emma's present.

777
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:45,329
He opened the door of his mother's bedroom
and went nervously inside.

778
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:49,220
Alison Mayhew was sitting up in her bed.

779
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,390
She was very thin and she looked very tired
and ill.

780
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,140
But she smiled when she saw her son.

781
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,430
'A present!

782
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,270
What have you brought me?'

783
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:02,270
she asked.

784
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,369
'The present is from Emma,' Dexter said.

785
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,890
'Let's open it.'

786
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:17,789
The parcel contained books - long, serious
books - Edith Wharton, Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond

787
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:18,789
Chandler.

788
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:22,730
'How kind she is,' Alison Mayhew said.

789
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,290
'I'm very grateful to Emma.

790
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:33,430
But please suggest to her that short stories
might be more useful in future.'

791
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:38,749
Dexter tried to laugh, but inside his head
he was screaming.

792
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:45,279
A few minutes later, he went downstairs to
the kitchen, where his father was making lunch.

793
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:51,079
Dexter picked up a glass of wine and drank
it quickly, then he refilled the glass.

794
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,750
'Dexter, please be careful,' his father said.

795
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,249
'You drink too much.

796
00:54:57,249 --> 00:55:01,609
Alcohol is poison for you these days.'

797
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,359
'I've got a headache, Dad,' Dexter said.

798
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:07,180
'I've been working too hard.

799
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,299
I'm going to lie down for half an hour.

800
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:10,640
I don't need any food.'

801
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,330
He went upstairs to the room he had slept
in when he was a child.

802
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:20,950
A few minutes later he was unconscious on
his childhood bed.

803
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:25,060
It was evening when Dexter woke.

804
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,999
The whole afternoon had passed.

805
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,420
He went to find his father in the kitchen.

806
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,590
'I'm sorry, Dad,' he said.

807
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,160
'I didn't mean to sleep that long.

808
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,740
Why didn't you wake me?'

809
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,099
'It wasn't my job.

810
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:44,760
You're not a child any longer, Dexter,' his
father replied angrily.

811
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,530
'And you were so drunk, there wasn't any point
in waking you.

812
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:54,300
You don't think that your mother wanted to
see you like this, do you?'

813
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,160
'I'm sorry,' Dexter said again.

814
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,970
He looked around the room.

815
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,849
'Where did I put my car keys?

816
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:03,520
I have to go now.'

817
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,690
'I've got them and I'm going to keep them,'
his father replied.

818
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,349
'You must not drive when you're drunk, Dexter.

819
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:14,249
You'll kill yourself or you'll kill someone
else, which will be worse.

820
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,559
I'll drive you to the station now.

821
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,000
You can get the train back to London.

822
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,900
And you can come and collect your car at the
weekend, if you're sober by then.

823
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,960
Perhaps you'll be able to talk sensibly to
your mother then, too.'

824
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,720
Dexter tried to argue, but his father wouldn't
listen to him.

825
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,270
And he wouldn't talk to him on the way to
the station.

826
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:41,839
But as Dexter was getting out of the car,
the older man held his arm.

827
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,839
'Listen to me, Dexter,' Stephen Mayhew said
very seriously.

828
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:51,249
'Your mother was looking forward to your visit
today.

829
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:53,010
And now she's very upset.

830
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:57,089
She hasn't long to live, you must know that.

831
00:56:57,089 --> 00:57:01,589
If you come here drunk again, I won't let
you into the house to see her.

832
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:03,180
Do you understand me?

833
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,400
I won't open the door to you.'

834
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,650
Stephen drove away and Dexter walked sadly
into the station.

835
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:15,230
When he was waiting for the train he tried
to phone Emma.

836
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,930
'Emma will understand me,' he told himself.

837
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,740
'I need to see Emma.'

838
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,900
But Emma wasn't at home.

839
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,059
He left a message on her answer phone.

840
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,390
He asked if they could meet later that evening.

841
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:32,710
He said he'd call again.

842
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,859
When he got back to his flat and called again,
Dexter still got the answer phone.

843
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:41,559
'Emma, where are you?' he said to the machine.

844
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,489
'I miss you.

845
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:45,390
I need you.

846
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,700
I'll try again later.'

847
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,730
Covent Garden and King's Cross, London.

848
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:57,849
Emma didn't get any of Dexter's phone messages
that evening because she wasn't at home.

849
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:04,289
When Dexter left his first message, she had
just left her flat in Earls Court, West London.

850
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:07,170
She was walking to the nearby Underground
station.

851
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:12,819
She was on her way to an Italian restaurant
in Covent Garden where she was going to meet

852
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:15,390
Ian Whitehead.

853
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:21,910
Emma had only seen Ian a few times since she
had left Loco Caliente to train as a teacher,

854
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,739
but they were still friends.

855
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:27,220
They sometimes talked on the phone.

856
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,920
And tonight he had invited her to meet him
for dinner.

857
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,289
They had been friends for three years, but
Emma had never slept with Ian.

858
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:39,460
She knew that he wanted to sleep with her.

859
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,749
She liked him, but did she want to sleep with
him too?

860
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:49,180
She didn't know and she wondered now how the
evening was going to end.

861
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:53,150
At the station, Emma bought a ticket and waited
for her train.

862
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,220
Soon, it arrived and Emma boarded it.

863
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,759
She sat and thought about how her life had
changed since she had met Ian.

864
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:06,680
She no longer shared a flat with Tilly Killick.

865
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,890
Now she lived on her own in the small rented
flat in Earls Court.

866
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:16,039
And now she was ready for a new career.

867
00:59:16,039 --> 00:59:21,650
Tomorrow she was going to an interview for
a job as a teacher of English and Drama.

868
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:28,329
The job was in a comprehensive school in Leytonstone,
in a poor part of East London.

869
00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:32,329
Emma was very confident about this job.

870
00:59:32,329 --> 00:59:37,069
She had enjoyed her year at teacher training
college and she knew that she was going to

871
00:59:37,069 --> 00:59:39,390
be a brilliant teacher.

872
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,180
Yes, her life had changed.

873
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:47,190
But Emma knew that her character had changed
too.

874
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,500
She had mellowed.

875
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,700
She no longer had a strong opinion about everything
that happened in the world.

876
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,710
Sometimes, she could even see that there were
two sides to any argument.

877
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:05,230
'I'm twenty-seven - perhaps that's the reason,'
she thought.

878
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:08,539
'Perhaps I'm getting old.

879
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:11,980
Perhaps I'm ready to compromise.'

880
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,849
When Emma arrived at the restaurant, she saw
that Ian was already there.

881
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:21,239
She hoped that this was the beginning of a
pleasant evening.

882
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:25,339
Later, she'd decide about what was going to
happen next.

883
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:30,619
They ordered food and wine and Ian started
to talk.

884
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:36,259
He seemed very nervous and Emma tried to help
him to relax.

885
01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:42,269
But an hour later - at about the time Dexter
was leaving his second message on her answer

886
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:45,660
phone - Emma was feeling desperate.

887
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:50,049
Ian had been trying much too hard to make
her laugh.

888
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:54,700
She guessed that he was practising his stand-up
comedy act on her.

889
01:00:54,700 --> 01:01:01,019
The problem was that everything he said was
a joke and it was impossible to have a conversation

890
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:02,319
with him.

891
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,710
This was driving her crazy.

892
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,529
She guessed that Ian was feeling desperate
too.

893
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:13,130
Everything he said made the evening worse.

894
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,710
In part of her mind Emma wanted to leave and
go home.

895
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:22,230
But in another part of her mind she felt terribly
sorry for Ian.

896
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:28,779
It was clear to her that he wasn't a good
comedian and that his ambition to have a career

897
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:32,299
in stand-up was just a dream.

898
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:36,960
At last, she couldn't listen to any more bad
jokes.

899
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,960
'Ian,' she said suddenly, 'will you be quiet
for a minute, please!

900
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,410
Will you just shut up!'

901
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,140
Ian looked very surprised and he stopped talking.

902
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:58,269
After a few minutes of silence, he asked quietly,
'Do you see your friend Dexter much these

903
01:01:58,269 --> 01:01:59,269
days?'

904
01:01:59,269 --> 01:02:05,240
Emma suddenly understood why Ian had been
so nervous all evening.

905
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,859
'No, we don't meet very often,' she replied.

906
01:02:08,859 --> 01:02:11,749
'But we speak on the phone most days.

907
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:17,630
He's busy with his TV career and his girlfriends
- you know what Dexter's like.

908
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:23,079
He's always been a bit crazy and now he's
a bit more crazy, I think.

909
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:29,230
His mother is seriously ill and he's drinking
far too much.'

910
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,309
'I'm sorry to hear that,' said Ian.

911
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:38,499
Then, after a pause, he said, 'To be honest
I never liked him much.

912
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:41,359
I always thought that he took you for granted.'

913
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,989
They were both silent for a few minutes.

914
01:02:44,989 --> 01:02:47,579
Then Ian spoke again.

915
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:51,140
'Well, we've finished the wine,' he said.

916
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,609
'Shall we have some brandy?'

917
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:59,900
By the time they left the restaurant, Emma
and Ian were both a bit drunk.

918
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,349
Outside the restaurant, Emma turned to Ian
and kissed him.

919
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:08,890
She had decided that tonight, she was ready
to compromise.

920
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:13,479
'Shall I come home with you?'

921
01:03:13,479 --> 01:03:15,460
she asked quietly.

922
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:20,759
'Emma, that's a lovely idea,' Ian told her.

923
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:26,960
And when Dexter phoned Emma's number again
at midnight, there still wasn't anyone at

924
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,960
home.

925
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:34,160
Emma was at Ian Whitehead's and she was going
to stay there until morning.

926
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,900
Dexter was now feeling desperate.

927
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,349
So he called another number.

928
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:44,430
'Hi, Naomi, this is Dexter,' he said in his
television voice.

929
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,849
'I miss you, girl.

930
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:47,270
I need you tonight.

931
01:03:47,270 --> 01:04:05,940
Can you find a taxi and come to my flat?

932
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,460
CHAPTER SEVEN
Show Business

933
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,700
Friday, 15th July 1994

934
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,509
Leytonstone and the Isle of Dogs, East London

935
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:21,170
Emma Morley got up early on 15th July.

936
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:25,380
Emma now lived in a rented flat in Leytonstone.

937
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:31,279
It was quite near Cromwell Road Comprehensive
School, where she taught English and Drama.

938
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:35,980
She had moved to the flat when she started
teaching at the school, in the autumn of the

939
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,769
year before.

940
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:43,049
Ian Whitehead spent much of his time at the
flat too.

941
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:46,140
Emma thought she was probably in love with
Ian.

942
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:52,859
'I am in love with him, aren't I?' she asked
herself daily.

943
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:59,849
And every day she told herself that she was
in love with him - yes, of course she was

944
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:00,849
in love with him.

945
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:04,930
And her parents liked him very much, especially
her mother.

946
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:09,009
That was important to her.

947
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:14,589
'It's good when people's partners and mothers
get on well,' she thought.

948
01:05:14,589 --> 01:05:20,289
But Ian did take up a lot of space in the
little flat.

949
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:24,960
But Emma had a bigger problem than the size
of her flat.

950
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:33,130
Ian Whitehead and Dexter Mayhew - the two
men in her life - still didn't get on well.

951
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:39,759
Dexter didn't like Emma's friendship with
Ian even though he had his own girlfriends.

952
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:46,829
The truth was that Dexter needed Emma as an
emotional support but Ian didn't really understand

953
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:48,380
this need.

954
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:53,920
And Emma was especially important to Dexter
now that his mother had died.

955
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:59,130
Ian was also very jealous of Dexter, because
he didn't want Emma to have a best friend

956
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:02,430
who wasn't himself.

957
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:09,369
All this was a special problem on the 15th,
because when the evening came, Emma was really

958
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:13,480
needed in three places at once.

959
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,319
Tonight was going to be Dexter's big night.

960
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:23,230
Tonight, a new programme was going to be on
television and Dexter was one of the presenters.

961
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:31,009
This programme - Late at Night - was a much
more important one than The Bigger Picture

962
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:35,140
and perhaps it was going to make Dexter a
big star.

963
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:41,930
Another of the presenters - a glamorous woman
called Suki Meadows - was already a star.

964
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:48,680
The programme was going to be live and Dexter
wanted Emma to be at the television studio

965
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,999
to support him.

966
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:54,670
He no longer saw his other friends from university.

967
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:57,739
He no longer wanted to see them.

968
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:02,269
Callum O'Neill, whose computer business was
doing well, often called.

969
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:08,769
He left messages on Dexter's answer phone
but Dexter never called him back.

970
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:12,700
Emma was the only one of his old friends that
he cared about.

971
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:18,210
But tonight was going to be Emma's big night
too.

972
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:24,960
Emma was in charge of her school's end-of-year
drama production, the musical Oliver!

973
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,289
And the performance was happening tonight.

974
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:36,150
Of course this wasn't as important as Dexter's
programme, but clearly Emma had to be there.

975
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:42,940
She'd spent many weeks preparing the children
for the show and she had to be with them.

976
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,799
Tonight their parents were coming to watch
them.

977
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:53,210
And for their parents, they were all going
to be little stars, for one night at least.

978
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:58,200
Emma hoped it was going to make her the headmaster's
little star too.

979
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:04,589
Her teaching career - making a difference
- was just as important as Dexter's more glamorous

980
01:08:04,589 --> 01:08:05,589
TV career, she thought.

981
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:11,450
She knew that Dexter didn't really believe
this.

982
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:13,420
And then there was Ian.

983
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,370
Ian was feeling ill today.

984
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,690
He didn't really want to go out at all tonight.

985
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,950
And he didn't want her to go out.

986
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,410
But she understood.

987
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,590
She loved him, didn't she?

988
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:29,060
And he was going to come to Oliver!

989
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,779
Even if he still felt ill.

990
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:33,420
He'd promised her that.

991
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,920
Before leaving to go to work Emma picked up
the phone and called Dexter's number.

992
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,980
She got his answerphone.

993
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,980
'Hi!

994
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:42,980
Speak to me!

995
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,980
Leave me a message!'

996
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,319
Dexter's 'cockney' voice said on the recording.

997
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:51,010
So she left him a message.

998
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:55,720
'Hi Dex, I'm sorry it's early for you,' she
said.

999
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,640
'You're probably not awake yet.

1000
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,390
But some of us have jobs to go to.

1001
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:06,839
I'm sorry I won't be with you at the studio
tonight, but I want to wish you luck.

1002
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:10,190
I know you understand that it's my big night
too.

1003
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,800
That's show business, Dex!

1004
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,150
I'll speak to you later.

1005
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,500
Lots of love to you.

1006
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:23,420
Oh - and Dex - you really have to change that
answer phone message.'

1007
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:29,049
Dexter Mayhew wasn't feeling good when he
arrived at the television studio on the Isle

1008
01:09:29,049 --> 01:09:30,560
of Dogs.

1009
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,339
It was his father's fault.

1010
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:36,790
His father had left a message on his answer
phone earlier in the day.

1011
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:41,609
'I called to wish you luck for tonight,' his
father had said.

1012
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:43,099
'I'll be watching the programme.

1013
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:47,589
It's so sad that your mother isn't here to
see you.

1014
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:50,230
She was so... proud of you.

1015
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,710
Well, good luck Dexter.

1016
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:57,070
And don't take any notice of the newspapers.'

1017
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:02,739
When he'd heard the message, Dexter had gone
out and bought all the daily newspapers.

1018
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:07,900
He'd opened the first one at the television
pages and read the headline.

1019
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:12,119
IS DEXTER MAYHEW THE NASTIEST MAN ON TV?

1020
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:19,320
Dexter had drunk some vodka to settle his
nerves as he read the story beneath the headline.

1021
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,210
The story wasn't kind to him.

1022
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:29,420
Dexter was a stupid, rich boy who'd been educated
at Winchester College but pretended to be

1023
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,260
a cockney, the author wrote mockingly.

1024
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:38,700
Dexter thought that he was popular with young
people, the author said, but really young

1025
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,580
people just laughed at him.

1026
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,719
They didn't connect with him at all.

1027
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:48,270
Dexter had felt sick when he read this.

1028
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:54,150
And he had had several more drinks before
he arrived at the television studio that evening.

1029
01:10:54,150 --> 01:11:00,020
In his dressing room at the studio, Dexter
sat quietly trying to relax.

1030
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,140
He had told the producer of the show that
he wanted to be alone.

1031
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,980
He was nervous.

1032
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:11,230
He had been a TV presenter for several years
now, so he was surprised at how nervous he

1033
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,790
felt.

1034
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:16,960
He didn't know what he was going to say when
the show started.

1035
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,810
When he thought about the whole hour the show
was going to last, his mind was suddenly empty.

1036
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:26,460
Now, he was very frightened.

1037
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,570
And the show was going to start in a few minutes.

1038
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:34,070
He took a bottle of vodka from his overcoat
pocket.

1039
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:39,200
There was a bottle of water on a table in
the dressing room.

1040
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,970
Presenters usually took a bottle of water
onto the set with them.

1041
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:48,510
The studio lights were always very hot and
they often needed to drink some water when

1042
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:49,820
they were off-camera.

1043
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,380
They couldn't speak clearly if their mouths
were dry.

1044
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:00,510
But Dexter wanted something to clear his mind,
not something to wet his mouth.

1045
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:06,280
He emptied the water into his washbasin and
refilled the bottle with vodka.

1046
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,199
Then he put it back on the table.

1047
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,850
It looked the same as before.

1048
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,699
Nobody would know that he was drinking vodka.

1049
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:17,800
'HEY THERE!' said a loud voice.

1050
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,219
'WELL, HOW ABOUT ALL THIS?'

1051
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:26,090
The owner of the loud voice was Suki Meadows.

1052
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:30,900
Suki was already a popular presenter of late-night
TV shows.

1053
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,780
Now she stood at the door smiling at Dexter.

1054
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:41,160
She was a small, pretty, friendly person and
she was always cheerful.

1055
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,489
Always!

1056
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:45,489
It didn't matter what was happening around
her.

1057
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:47,980
She was cheerful and she was noisy.

1058
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:53,440
'Why does Suki always speak in capital letters?'

1059
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,570
Dexter had sometimes asked himself.

1060
01:12:55,570 --> 01:12:58,210
But tonight he was thinking something else.

1061
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:01,380
'The viewers all love her.

1062
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,380
And she is very sexy,' he was thinking.

1063
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:08,070
'And I'm sure she's crazy about me.'

1064
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:14,620
Suki was wearing a very short skirt and a
shirt made of very thin cloth.

1065
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,080
And she was holding her own bottle of water.

1066
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:22,250
'COME HERE, DEX,' she said, entering the dressing
room.

1067
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:27,570
She put her water bottle on the table next
to his and put her arms around him.

1068
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,719
'YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT TONIGHT!

1069
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,870
WE'RE GOING TO BE GREAT TOGETHER!

1070
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:36,520
DEX AND SUKI, SUKI AND DEX!

1071
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,250
WHAT A TEAM, DEX!'

1072
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:46,469
And having wished him good luck in her own
way, Suki led Dexter out of the dressing room.

1073
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:49,990
On the way, they picked up their water bottles.

1074
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:55,210
Outside, on the set, they picked up their
microphones and inserted their earpieces.

1075
01:13:55,210 --> 01:14:01,540
They looked around them at the brightly coloured
set and the brightly dressed dancers who were

1076
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:04,969
standing ready to begin the warm up before
the show.

1077
01:14:04,969 --> 01:14:09,119
Then the music started, the dancers danced.

1078
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:15,770
When they had finished, Suki walked to the
front of the set and yelled to the audience.

1079
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:20,080
'ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A GREAT TIME?

1080
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,020
WELL, MAKE SOME NOISE FOR US!'

1081
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:27,070
At that moment, Dexter realized that he was
hopelessly drunk.

1082
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:32,790
Now it was his turn to speak and he couldn't
say anything.

1083
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:34,460
He didn't know what to say.

1084
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:38,880
This show was going to be a disaster.

1085
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,650
Someone in the audience shouted, 'You useless
idiot!

1086
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,540
Can't you speak?'

1087
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,060
Dexter had an idea.

1088
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:52,620
'Well, he's clearly been reading the newspapers,'
he shouted to the audience.

1089
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,690
He tried to laugh.

1090
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:59,650
A few of the audience laughed too, but not
many of them.

1091
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:04,590
Dexter needed another drink to clear his head,
he told himself.

1092
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:09,239
He took the top off his water bottle and drank.

1093
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,170
It was water, just water.

1094
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:14,610
At once he understood.

1095
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,480
The bottles had got mixed up.

1096
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,060
Suki had the vodka.

1097
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,630
And she was taking the top off her bottle.

1098
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:28,620
He wanted to stop her drinking, but it was
too late.

1099
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:34,810
As she tasted the liquid, Dexter saw the shock
in her eyes.

1100
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,239
And at that moment, the live programme began.

1101
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,520
'We're live!

1102
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:45,960
Say something Dexter,' the producer's voice
said in his earpiece.

1103
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,440
But Dexter couldn't speak and Suki was coughing.

1104
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,679
She recovered first, and she came to Dexter's
rescue.

1105
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,300
'SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1106
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:02,130
BUT AT LEAST YOU VIEWERS KNOW THAT THE PROGRAMME
IS LIVE!' she said.

1107
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,400
Suki went on speaking.

1108
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:10,730
Dexter tried hard to think clearly and after
a few minutes he was able to perform better

1109
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:11,730
with Suki.

1110
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:16,470
He wasn't very good, but he wasn't terrible.

1111
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,220
And Suki was amazing.

1112
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:25,909
She always spoke when Dexter didn't know what
to say and she tried to make Dexter look normal.

1113
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:30,250
The show wasn't a disaster.

1114
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,489
When the programme had finished, there was
a party for all the people who had appeared

1115
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,560
in it, and their friends and relations.

1116
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,510
Dexter stayed for the party, but he was quiet
and thoughtful.

1117
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:46,340
People congratulated him, but they didn't
speak to him for long.

1118
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:53,000
He ate lots of food and drank lots of wine,
but he wasn't happy.

1119
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,500
He knew that he hadn't performed well.

1120
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,250
He knew that Suki Meadows had rescued him.

1121
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:04,740
And he knew that she had been the star.

1122
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:08,140
Late in the evening, Suki came to sit next
to him.

1123
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,050
'That went OK, didn't it?'

1124
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:12,050
she said.

1125
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:16,750
For the first time that day, she wasn't speaking
in capital letters.

1126
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,980
'You saved us, Suki,' he said.

1127
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:25,030
'I was trying to settle my nerves, but I drank
too much before the show.

1128
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,510
I owe you an apology.'

1129
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,840
'Yes, you do,' she replied.

1130
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,770
'You have a problem with alcohol and we need
to talk about it.

1131
01:17:35,770 --> 01:17:41,349
You must understand this, Dexter - you won't
appear on this programme with me again if

1132
01:17:41,349 --> 01:17:42,349
you aren't sober.

1133
01:17:42,349 --> 01:17:46,250
And you must never bring alcohol onto the
set again.'

1134
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:51,770
'What can I do to make you feel better about
me?'

1135
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,850
Dexter asked her.

1136
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:59,710
'Well, you can take me out for dinner next
week,' Suki said.

1137
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:02,280
'Take me somewhere very expensive.

1138
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,550
On Tuesday.'

1139
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:06,730
Dexter thought for a moment.

1140
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:13,040
He had promised to meet Emma on Tuesday evening,
but he could change that.

1141
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,119
Emma was his best friend.

1142
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:17,360
She was always there for him.

1143
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,080
'All right,' he replied.

1144
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,469
'We have a date.'

1145
01:18:23,469 --> 01:18:25,120
'Good,' said Suki, kissing him.

1146
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,909
'And now, you must come and meet my mother.'

1147
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:37,020
Dexter was feeling a bit unhappy on the Isle
of Dogs, but Emma was on top of the world

1148
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,100
in Leytonstone.

1149
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,360
Oliver had been a great success.

1150
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:46,679
Of course there had been arguments and fights
among the children before the show.

1151
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,000
That always happened.

1152
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,990
They were excited and some of them were nervous.

1153
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:58,449
But Emma had settled their nerves and when
the music began, they all worked together

1154
01:18:58,449 --> 01:19:00,030
and helped each other.

1155
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:03,780
So the show had been wonderful.

1156
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:08,840
Phil Godaiming, Emma's headteacher, was very
pleased.

1157
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:13,239
People whose children could act and sing like
that were going to be proud, he thought.

1158
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:20,160
They were going to speak well of the school
- and of its headteacher, of course.

1159
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:26,230
At the party after the show the school staff,
and many of the proud parents of the cast,

1160
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:28,630
congratulated Emma.

1161
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:31,270
She drank her wine and smiled at everyone.

1162
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:36,679
And late in the evening, Mr Godaiming came
to sit next to her.

1163
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:41,949
'You're a wonderful teacher, Emma,' he said
quietly in her ear.

1164
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,949
'And you look very beautiful tonight.

1165
01:19:44,949 --> 01:20:00,170
I have great plans for you next year.'

1166
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,869
CHAPTER EIGHT
A Crisis

1167
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:06,860
Saturday, 15th July 1995

1168
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,949
Walthamstow, East London and Soho, Central
London

1169
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:15,760
'I'm going out now, Ian,' Emma called.

1170
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,640
Then she added carefully, 'Are you sure that
you don't want to come with me, darling?

1171
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:26,790
Dexter will be pleased to see you, if you
do come.'

1172
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:29,010
'No, I can't come tonight.'

1173
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,639
Ian replied, entering the room.

1174
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:35,070
'I've got things to do tonight, don't you
remember?

1175
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,560
I'm performing at the House of Ha Ha.

1176
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,389
You go on your own.

1177
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:39,570
I'll be fine.'

1178
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,739
This was the right answer, Emma thought.

1179
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:47,110
She was quite glad that she was going to see
Dexter alone.

1180
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:52,639
She wanted to talk to him about her relationship
with Ian Whitehead.

1181
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:57,750
Emma was beginning to understand that she
had made a bad mistake about Ian.

1182
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:02,420
They were living together now in a flat in
Walthamstow.

1183
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,929
They had bought the flat together.

1184
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:08,520
And that was the mistake.

1185
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,310
Ian loved her very much, Emma knew this.

1186
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:17,639
And she had told herself often that she really
loved him too and that she wanted to spend

1187
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,770
her life with him.

1188
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,770
But she now knew that it wasn't true.

1189
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,639
She was no longer happy with Ian.

1190
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:28,670
She just didn't love him.

1191
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:34,639
She knew that Ian hated the success of her
career and that he hated the failure of his

1192
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:35,730
own career.

1193
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:42,179
He still wanted desperately to be a stand-up
comedian, but he only ever performed at pubs

1194
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:44,099
and small comedy clubs.

1195
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:50,929
Ian just wasn't very good at stand-up and
he didn't earn much money from it.

1196
01:21:50,929 --> 01:21:54,130
Emma was feeling trapped.

1197
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:57,800
So she needed Dexter to understand.

1198
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,929
She hoped it was going to be possible to talk
sensibly to him tonight.

1199
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:06,329
She was feeling a little nervous about

1200
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:07,329
that.

1201
01:22:07,329 --> 01:22:11,070
Perhaps talking about Ian wasn't going to
be easy.

1202
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:15,030
In the past, it had been easy to talk to Dexter.

1203
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,610
But now he had changed.

1204
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:21,969
He drank far too much and he was more careless
than ever about people's feelings.

1205
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:27,550
Ian wasn't Emma's only problem of course.

1206
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:31,090
She was no longer enjoying her job much either.

1207
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,469
She was a good teacher, she knew that.

1208
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:38,590
But she got tired and she didn't have much
time to write.

1209
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:44,590
She still wanted to be a writer, but when
she did write, the results were never very

1210
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:45,590
good.

1211
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:49,840
That was as bad a problem as her relationship
with Ian.

1212
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:56,500
But the greatest problem for Emma was that
she knew, in her heart, that Dexter Mayhew

1213
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:00,140
was the person she really loved.

1214
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,579
So there it was.

1215
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:05,619
Everything was a bit hopeless.

1216
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:12,150
Ian's career wasn't what he'd hoped for and
her career wasn't what she'd hoped for.

1217
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:16,960
She had a feeling that Dexter's career wasn't
quite what he'd hoped for either.

1218
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,199
Suki Meadows was his girlfriend these days.

1219
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:25,810
But she was now clearly the star presenter
of Late at Night.

1220
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:29,290
Dex was definitely the number two person.

1221
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:32,860
He wasn't very popular with the audience.

1222
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:38,989
And nasty people often wrote cruel things
about him in the newspapers now.

1223
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:44,630
Emma and Dexter were meeting for dinner at
an expensive restaurant in Soho.

1224
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:51,110
It was the kind of place where fashionable
people ate - people in television, like Dexter

1225
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:53,360
and Suki Meadows.

1226
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,940
Emma hoped she was going to like it.

1227
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:00,000
Dexter was waiting for Emma outside the restaurant.

1228
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,840
He was talking on his mobile phone.

1229
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,739
Emma heard his caller's voice quite clearly
as she arrived.

1230
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:11,620
'TEN MILLION VIEWERS THIS WEEK, DEX!'

1231
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:14,860
the voice said, very loudly.

1232
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,180
'TEN MILLION!'

1233
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:24,050
'Suki, let me explain something about telephones,'
Dex replied into the phone.

1234
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:27,760
'You don't need to shout into them.

1235
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,000
The phone does the shouting for you.

1236
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,540
I have to go now,' he added when he saw Emma.

1237
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,829
'I'll see you soon.'

1238
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:42,600
'Dex, those things are so stupid,' Emma said,
pointing at Dexter's phone.

1239
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,130
'Why don't you throw it away?'

1240
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:51,369
'You'll have one in less than six months,'
Dexter replied, kissing her.

1241
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:52,460
'You'll see.

1242
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,000
I'm right.'

1243
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,550
They went inside the restaurant and sat at
the bar where Dexter bought drinks.

1244
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:04,179
After a few minutes, they heard a soft, female
voice behind them.

1245
01:25:04,179 --> 01:25:06,880
'Do you want cigarettes, sir?'

1246
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,380
the voice said.

1247
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:14,190
They turned to see a very tall, extraordinarily
beautiful girl.

1248
01:25:14,190 --> 01:25:21,340
The girl was dressed only in black underwear
and stockings, and she carried a tray containing

1249
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,170
the cigarettes.

1250
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,530
She had a fixed smile.

1251
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,969
It wasn't a happy smile.

1252
01:25:27,969 --> 01:25:30,460
Dexter bought some cigarettes.

1253
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:37,000
He spent a long time finding his money, so
that he could look at the girl's body.

1254
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,090
Then the girl moved away.

1255
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:43,380
'Why is she dressed like that, Dexter?'

1256
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,599
Emma said.

1257
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:48,510
'I don't know, Em,' Dexter replied.

1258
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:51,650
'Perhaps all her ugly clothes are in the laundry.

1259
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:53,500
You could look like that if you wanted,' he
added.

1260
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,460
'You've got a great body.'

1261
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:02,329
'But I don't want to look like that,' said
Emma.

1262
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,860
Soon a waiter took them to their table.

1263
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:08,880
They ordered drinks and when those arrived,
they ordered food.

1264
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,579
Dexter was drinking quickly.

1265
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:16,699
'And soon he'll be drunk - again,' Emma told
herself.

1266
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:20,389
And she couldn't stop thinking about the cigarette
girl.

1267
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:27,750
'Why am I eating in the kind of restaurant
where girls have to dress like that?'

1268
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,180
she asked herself.

1269
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,719
Then she asked Dexter the same question.

1270
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,869
'This place is terrible, Dex,' Emma said.

1271
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:42,130
'Haven't women made any progress in the last
hundred years?'

1272
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,760
'You don't understand, Em,' Dexter said.

1273
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,000
'Dressing like that gives her power over men.

1274
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
She enjoys it.'

1275
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,260
'Don't be stupid, Dexter,' Emma said.

1276
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,180
'The owner of this place makes her wear those
clothes.

1277
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:00,710
If she doesn't wear them, she'll lose her
job.

1278
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:06,469
She only works here because she needs the
money, you can see that.

1279
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:09,920
She has no power over anyone!'

1280
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,170
'Well, you're still the same old Emma, aren't
you?'

1281
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:15,770
Dexter said crossly.

1282
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:18,420
'Emma, the angry, socialist feminist.

1283
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:22,770
I thought that you'd mellowed, but clearly
I was wrong about that.

1284
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,520
You never want to compromise, do you?'

1285
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,590
After that, the evening got worse and worse.

1286
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:33,570
Dexter frequently left the table to visit
the toilet.

1287
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:36,690
Each time, he stopped to talk to the cigarette
girl.

1288
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:43,389
The last time it happened, Emma saw him push
a piece of paper into her stocking.

1289
01:27:43,389 --> 01:27:47,110
Emma had no doubt that he was giving the girl
his phone number.

1290
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:53,960
When he returned to the table, Emma decided
she had had enough of his behaviour.

1291
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:59,880
She pushed the table away from her, spilling
their drinks, and ran up the stairs out of

1292
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,530
the restaurant.

1293
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:05,449
She could hear Dexter behind her, calling
her name.

1294
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:07,929
She didn't turn round.

1295
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:11,139
In the street, Dexter finally caught up with
her.

1296
01:28:11,139 --> 01:28:14,750
'Emma, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1297
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:18,920
I didn't mean to upset you,' he said desperately.

1298
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,329
Suddenly, Emma turned to face him.

1299
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:27,429
'Dexter, whenever I see you now you're drunk,'
she said.

1300
01:28:27,429 --> 01:28:30,840
'I haven't seen you sober for three years.

1301
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,599
I don't know you any longer.

1302
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:36,080
You're obnoxious these days.

1303
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:41,520
You were always a bit obnoxious, but now you're
totally obnoxious.'

1304
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,989
'I'm just having fun, Emma,' Dexter replied.

1305
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:50,119
'Well, it isn't fun for me,' Emma replied.

1306
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:52,699
'Let's stop this now, Dexter.

1307
01:28:52,699 --> 01:28:54,829
You don't care about me.

1308
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,900
We don't have to meet any more.'

1309
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,790
'Emma, of course we have to meet,' Dexter
said desperately.

1310
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:04,480
'We're Dex and Em, aren't we?

1311
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,699
We'll always be Dex and Em.'

1312
01:29:07,699 --> 01:29:10,250
For a moment he was quiet.

1313
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:14,010
He was thinking of the day of his mother's
funeral.

1314
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:18,280
He was thinking of Emma's kindness to him
that day.

1315
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:22,349
She had held him as he cried uncontrollably.

1316
01:29:22,349 --> 01:29:26,219
He had always taken her for granted, he knew
that.

1317
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:31,540
'Why am I throwing all this away?' he was
asking himself.

1318
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,510
But he knew that he couldn't stop himself.

1319
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:38,070
'Dexter,' Emma said sadly.

1320
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:44,800
'I love you very much and I probably always
will love you.

1321
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,340
But I'm afraid I don't like you any longer.

1322
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:53,989
I don't like the person that you've become.

1323
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:56,170
I don't want to hear from you again.

1324
01:29:56,170 --> 01:30:00,360
Please don't try to contact me.'

1325
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:05,980
She left him standing in the street and walked
away.

1326
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:16,600
CHAPTER NINE
Things End

1327
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:27,220
Monday, 15th July 1996

1328
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:33,190
Leytonstone and Walthamstow, East London

1329
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:36,760
At six o'clock on the last day of term at
Cromwell Road lx.

1330
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,400
Comprehensive School, almost everyone had
gone home.

1331
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:47,550
Only Emma Morley and Mr Godaiming, the school's
headteacher, were still in the building.

1332
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:52,260
They were lying on the floor of Mr Godaiming's
office.

1333
01:30:52,260 --> 01:31:00,300
'I'll miss you very much during the holidays,
Emma,' Mr Godaiming said as they put on their

1334
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,300
clothes.

1335
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,790
'I'll miss our Friday afternoons together.'

1336
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:09,449
'No you won't, Phil, you'll have Mrs Godaiming,'
Emma replied unkindly.

1337
01:31:09,449 --> 01:31:12,340
'You'll be fine.'

1338
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:17,770
Emma wondered, as she spoke, why she always
felt so cross after their meetings in the

1339
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:19,210
headteacher's office.

1340
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:23,780
Afterwards she always felt unhappy and that
made her cross.

1341
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:28,909
They collected their coats and books and the
headteacher locked the office.

1342
01:31:28,909 --> 01:31:35,239
As they walked to the school car park, Emma
was thinking hard.

1343
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:40,820
She had been Phil Godaiming's lover for nine
months now and she was starting to worry about

1344
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:41,820
this.

1345
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:48,139
She was afraid that he was going to tell his
wife about their relationship and ask for

1346
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:49,280
a divorce.

1347
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,989
That was not what Emma wanted at all.

1348
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:54,760
She didn't love Phil.

1349
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,469
She had never really loved him.

1350
01:31:56,469 --> 01:32:02,060
For a short time, he had made her feel better
when her life had become very sad.

1351
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:06,610
She wasn't seeing Dexter any longer and she
missed him.

1352
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:10,760
And her relationship with Ian Whitehead had
gone wrong.

1353
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:14,730
Phil had helped her to be confident during
the bad times.

1354
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:18,290
But she certainly didn't want to marry him.

1355
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:22,280
And she thought now that it was time for this
relationship to end.

1356
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:28,810
As Mr Godaiming opened the door of his car,
Emma held his arm.

1357
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:35,850
'Phil, I'm sorry but I don't want to be your
lover any longer,' she said.

1358
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:37,719
'I feel bad about our relationship.

1359
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,730
I feel bad about your wife.

1360
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,679
I'm not happy.'

1361
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:47,570
'You were very happy ten minutes ago, Emma,'
the headteacher said.

1362
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:48,670
He laughed.

1363
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:55,650
'No, Phil, you were very happy ten minutes
ago,' Emma replied sadly.

1364
01:32:55,650 --> 01:33:00,060
Phil Godaiming wasn't pleased to hear Emma's
words.

1365
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:04,530
He'd enjoyed their meetings after school on
Fridays.

1366
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:09,770
He argued for some time, but clearly, Emma
wasn't going to change her mind.

1367
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:14,380
'We'll talk about this next term,' he said.

1368
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:20,070
He got into his car, closed the door and drove
quickly out of the car park.

1369
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:24,880
Emma travelled sadly home to Walthamstow on
the Underground.

1370
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,390
On her way home, she bought some wine to drink
later.

1371
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:32,680
She was going to spend the evening on her
own.

1372
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,560
Ian Whitehead no longer lived with her.

1373
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,210
They had ended their relationship after a
terrible argument.

1374
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:45,040
They had argued about Ian's jealousy and his
selfishness.

1375
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,969
At the end of their argument they had both
cried.

1376
01:33:48,969 --> 01:33:52,460
They had cried for each other and for the
end of their relationship.

1377
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:55,540
But they both knew that it had to end.

1378
01:33:55,540 --> 01:34:03,050
It had all been so sad, Emma thought now,
as she sat in the train.

1379
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:07,210
Late that evening, after she had drunk the
wine, Emma turned on her television.

1380
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:12,320
The first person she saw was Dexter Mayhew.

1381
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:18,370
Suddenly, Emma realized that it was exactly
a year since she had spoken to him.

1382
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:23,210
She knew that Dexter's TV career hadn't been
very successful recently.

1383
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:27,360
Viewers had never really loved him, it seemed.

1384
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,370
They had only loved to hate him.

1385
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:34,020
And nowadays most of them just hated him.

1386
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:40,099
Dexter was now presenting a very late-night
TV show about computer games.

1387
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:43,260
Few people watched it.

1388
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,960
Emma did watch the show for a few minutes.

1389
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,940
She thought that Dexter wasn't looking well.

1390
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:54,179
His face was looking tired and he no longer
seemed confident.

1391
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:59,429
Suddenly, Emma had a great feeling of friendship
and love for him.

1392
01:34:59,429 --> 01:35:06,250
She realized that for the last eight years,
she had thought about Dexter every day.

1393
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:09,349
Now she knew that she wanted his friendship
again.

1394
01:35:09,349 --> 01:35:14,010
She wanted him to be her best friend again.

1395
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:16,820
'I'll call him tomorrow,' she told herself.

1396
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:21,380
'I really will call him.'

1397
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:29,440
CHAPTER TEN
Resignation

1398
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:40,190
Tuesday, 15th July 1997

1399
01:35:40,190 --> 01:35:43,159
Central London

1400
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:48,389
The River Thames looked lovely on this warm,
sunny afternoon, Emma Morley thought.

1401
01:35:48,389 --> 01:35:52,900
It was a work day, but Emma wasn't at school.

1402
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,719
Teaching had finished for the term but there
was a very important staff meeting happening

1403
01:35:57,719 --> 01:35:59,659
at the school.

1404
01:35:59,659 --> 01:36:03,790
Emma was needed there, but she didn't really
care about that.

1405
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:09,010
She had phoned the headteacher's secretary
that morning and told her that she was ill

1406
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:10,860
and had to stay in bed.

1407
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:13,600
The woman clearly hadn't believed her.

1408
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,790
Emma didn't care about that either.

1409
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:19,329
Emma wasn't really ill at all.

1410
01:36:19,329 --> 01:36:21,320
In fact, she was feeling good.

1411
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:25,770
And she had been to a meeting - a meeting
with a publisher.

1412
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:33,719
At last Emma was feeling confident about something
she had written - a novel for young readers.

1413
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:37,940
It was about a group of children at an East
London school.

1414
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:43,790
The children were appearing in a school production
of Oliver! and the story was told by one of

1415
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:47,050
the actors - a girl called Julie Criscoll.

1416
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:53,190
Julie was a rude, angry, teenage girl with
a good heart.

1417
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:56,330
The book was funny and touching.

1418
01:36:56,330 --> 01:37:03,110
Emma had included silly drawings and handwritten
pages in her text, so parts of it looked like

1419
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,909
a schoolgirl's diary.

1420
01:37:04,909 --> 01:37:08,610
She knew that what she had written was really
good.

1421
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:12,309
And now, other people thought it was good
too.

1422
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:17,739
Perhaps soon, she was going to be a published
author.

1423
01:37:17,739 --> 01:37:22,699
Emma wanted to write and she wanted even more
to stop teaching.

1424
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:25,070
She thought every day about resigning.

1425
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:31,440
Her job at the school had been very difficult
for the last year.

1426
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:36,420
Phil Godaiming had been angry because she
no longer wanted to sleep with him.

1427
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:40,980
He'd tried to make her life difficult all
year.

1428
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:46,190
And now she knew that she could write well,
Emma wanted to spend her life writing.

1429
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:52,760
At her meeting this morning, she had told
the publisher about her ambitions.

1430
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:55,119
The publisher had been helpful.

1431
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:58,369
Emma's life was going to change.

1432
01:37:58,369 --> 01:38:03,400
As she walked by the river, her mobile phone
rang.

1433
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,260
Emma did now have a mobile.

1434
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:10,070
Dexter had been right after all.

1435
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:14,280
Phil had given it to her during the months
when they'd been close.

1436
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:19,739
'I want to be able to hear your voice at any
time,' he'd told her.

1437
01:38:19,739 --> 01:38:26,040
As she took the phone from her handbag, Emma
guessed that it was Phil phoning her now.

1438
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,570
She wasn't wrong.

1439
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:35,239
'So, you're ill in bed, are you?' he said
in his special loud, angry headteacher's voice.

1440
01:38:35,239 --> 01:38:36,909
'Well, I don't believe it.

1441
01:38:36,909 --> 01:38:39,429
I think you're outside, enjoying the sunshine.

1442
01:38:39,429 --> 01:38:41,230
I can hear the traffic noise.'

1443
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:46,270
'Don't shout at me, Phil,' Emma said quietly.

1444
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:50,099
'My name's Mr Godaiming, not Phil,' the man
replied.

1445
01:38:50,099 --> 01:38:53,040
'This is serious, you know that.

1446
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,790
I told you that today's meeting was a very
important one.

1447
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:59,540
There'll be trouble about this, Emma.

1448
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:04,860
And if you don't want a relationship with
me, I won't protect you from trouble.

1449
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,309
Your job is in danger.'

1450
01:39:06,309 --> 01:39:11,830
'No, it isn't,' Emma replied, laughing.

1451
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:14,440
'I'm resigning from my job - now!

1452
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,619
Do you understand?

1453
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,730
I've resigned!

1454
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:22,909
Goodbye, Mr Godaiming.'

1455
01:39:22,909 --> 01:39:28,050
She switched off her phone and for a moment,
she thought about throwing it into the river.

1456
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:46,340
But after a few seconds, she put it back in
her bag.

1457
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,940
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Dexter in Love

1458
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:54,239
Wednesday, 15th July 1998

1459
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,900
Chichester, Sussex

1460
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:03,540
Dexter Mayhew was lying in bed with Sylvie
Cope at the end of a difficult day.

1461
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:08,239
Recently, something strange had happened to
Dexter.

1462
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:10,530
He had fallen in love.

1463
01:40:10,530 --> 01:40:15,670
He'd had many lovers but he'd never been in
love before.

1464
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:21,400
And now the girl beside him was more important
to him than anything in the world.

1465
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:25,530
He almost couldn't believe his luck.

1466
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:33,090
Sylvie was tall, slim and beautiful, with
long, straight hair and a heart-shaped face.

1467
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:39,969
She and Dexter had known each other for several
months and they spent lots of time together.

1468
01:40:39,969 --> 01:40:46,380
Every weekend they flew to a different European
city and they always had a wonderful time.

1469
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,179
They spent lots of Dexter's money in expensive
shops.

1470
01:40:50,179 --> 01:40:56,820
Sylvie was excited to know Dexter in real
life, after seeing him on television.

1471
01:40:56,820 --> 01:41:01,671
But the truth was that Dexter liked Sylvie
much more than she liked him.

1472
01:41:01,671 --> 01:41:02,671
But Dexter actually enjoyed this.

1473
01:41:02,671 --> 01:41:03,671
It meant that Sylvie was different from his
other girlfriends.

1474
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:04,671
Sylvie worked in marketing.

1475
01:41:04,671 --> 01:41:05,671
Dexter had met many of her friends, who also
worked in marketing.

1476
01:41:05,671 --> 01:41:06,671
He hadn't liked them and they hadn't liked
him.

1477
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:07,671
Who cared?

1478
01:41:07,671 --> 01:41:08,671
And tonight, Dexter and Sylvie were staying
at the home of her parents in Chichester.

1479
01:41:08,671 --> 01:41:09,671
Today, Dexter had met the Cope family for
the first time.

1480
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:10,671
Dexter hadn't enjoyed meeting the Copes much.

1481
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:11,671
Sylvie's parents clearly didn't admire unimportant
television presenters and Sylvie's twin younger

1482
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:12,671
brothers had mocked him openly.

1483
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:13,671
But Dexter really didn't care about that.

1484
01:41:13,671 --> 01:41:14,671
Sylvie was on his side and that was the only
important thing.

1485
01:41:14,671 --> 01:41:15,671
Sylvie was on his side and now she was by
his side, in the big bed.

1486
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:16,671
'I love you,' Dexter said to her quietly.

1487
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:17,671
He'd never said these simple words to anyone
before.

1488
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:18,671
'You're amazing!' he added.

1489
01:41:18,671 --> 01:41:19,671
But Sylvie was already asleep.

1490
01:41:19,671 --> 01:41:20,671
As Dexter lay awake, he realized that he wanted
to tell someone else about Sylvie and about

1491
01:41:20,671 --> 01:41:21,671
his good luck.

1492
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:22,671
He wanted to tell someone he liked and trusted.

1493
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:23,671
And suddenly, he knew who he wanted to tell.

1494
01:41:23,671 --> 01:41:24,671
It was someone he hadn't spoken to for three
years.

1495
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:25,671
He wanted to tell Emma Morley.

1496
01:41:25,671 --> 01:41:26,671
CHAPTER TWELVE
Weddings

1497
01:41:26,671 --> 01:41:27,671
Thursday, 15th July 1999

1498
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:28,671
Somerset, England

1499
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:29,671
It seemed to Emma Morley that all her friends
were getting married this year.

1500
01:41:29,671 --> 01:41:30,671
As she drove to Somerset, in the west of England,
on the morning of 15th July, she thought of

1501
01:41:30,671 --> 01:41:31,671
the weddings she had been to recently.

1502
01:41:31,671 --> 01:41:32,671
Some of her friends from university had married
for the first time that year.

1503
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:33,671
Some of them had married for the second time.

1504
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:34,671
Watching these wedding ceremonies had made
Emma feel that she was growing old.

1505
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:35,671
All the university friends she met at them
asked her if she had a boyfriend.

1506
01:41:35,671 --> 01:41:36,671
And they all pretended to be sad for her when
she said she hadn't.

1507
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:37,671
But they all said she was looking better than
she had ever looked.

1508
01:41:37,671 --> 01:41:38,671
They were right.

1509
01:41:38,671 --> 01:41:39,671
She took better care of herself these days
and she even wore pretty clothes for these

1510
01:41:39,671 --> 01:41:40,671
occasions.

1511
01:41:40,671 --> 01:41:41,671
The best thing about these weddings for Emma
was that she had met Dexter Mayhew at several

1512
01:41:41,671 --> 01:41:42,671
of them.

1513
01:41:42,671 --> 01:41:43,671
At last they were speaking to each other again,
after more than three years of silence.

1514
01:41:43,671 --> 01:41:44,671
That was very, very good.

1515
01:41:44,671 --> 01:41:45,671
Of course, she had met Dexter's girlfriend
Sylvie too and perhaps that was less good.

1516
01:41:45,671 --> 01:41:46,671
But Dexter was clearly in love with the girl,
so Emma tried to be happy for him.

1517
01:41:46,671 --> 01:41:47,671
She had never seen Dexter really in love before.

1518
01:41:47,671 --> 01:41:48,671
This morning, Emma was driving to Somerset
for the marriage of Tilly Killick.

1519
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:49,671
Tilly was getting married at a posh hotel
in the countryside.

1520
01:41:49,671 --> 01:41:50,671
Dexter had known Tilly during their university
days too, so he was going to be there and

1521
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:51,671
Emma was looking forward to seeing him again.

1522
01:41:51,671 --> 01:41:52,671
She was driving an old car.

1523
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:53,671
It was the first car she had ever owned and
it was the best she was able to afford.

1524
01:41:53,671 --> 01:41:54,671
Emma certainly wasn't a rich woman.

1525
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:55,671
In fact, she was now living on a small advance
from a publisher and was writing her second

1526
01:41:55,671 --> 01:41:56,671
book about Julie Criscoll.

1527
01:41:56,671 --> 01:41:57,671
But the first book was going to be published
soon and the publisher expected it to sell

1528
01:41:57,671 --> 01:41:58,671
very well.

1529
01:41:58,671 --> 01:41:59,671
Emma had some problems with her car during
the journey and she was a bit late when she

1530
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:00,671
arrived at the hotel.

1531
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:01,671
The ceremony had already begun when she entered
the big marriage room, so she found a seat

1532
01:42:01,671 --> 01:42:02,671
at the back of the room.

1533
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:03,671
As she was sitting down, Dexter Mayhew turned
round and saw her.

1534
01:42:03,671 --> 01:42:04,671
He smiled and waved his hand.

1535
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:05,671
Dexter was sitting at the front with Sylvie.

1536
01:42:05,671 --> 01:42:06,671
He hadn't really been listening to the ceremony.

1537
01:42:06,671 --> 01:42:07,671
He had been counting the number of women in
the room he had slept with.

1538
01:42:07,671 --> 01:42:08,671
'It's five,' he thought.

1539
01:42:08,671 --> 01:42:09,671
'It's five in one room, including the bride.

1540
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:10,671
It's a good score.

1541
01:42:10,671 --> 01:42:11,671
Is it a record?

1542
01:42:11,671 --> 01:42:12,671
Do I get an extra point for the bride?

1543
01:42:12,671 --> 01:42:13,671
And really, it's five-and-a-half if I count
that night with Emma.'

1544
01:42:13,671 --> 01:42:14,671
And as he thought this, he realized that it
was a bad thing to think.

1545
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:15,671
He also realized that he wanted to talk to
Emma very much.

1546
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:16,671
'I'll try to talk to her alone,' he thought.

1547
01:42:16,671 --> 01:42:17,671
'I need to tell her everything.'

1548
01:42:17,671 --> 01:42:18,671
After the ceremony, the party began.

1549
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:19,671
Dexter left Sylvie with some friends and started
to look for Emma.

1550
01:42:19,671 --> 01:42:20,671
But the first person he met was Callum O'Neill.

1551
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:21,671
The two men hadn't spoken for a long time.

1552
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:22,671
Dexter had heard that Callum had sold his
computer business for a huge amount of money.

1553
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:23,671
He had now started a new business - a successful
chain of sandwich shops.

1554
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:24,671
Today, he was very expensively dressed in
beautiful, fashionable clothes.

1555
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:25,671
Dexter remembered that at Edinburgh University,
Callum had worn the same pair of trousers

1556
01:42:25,671 --> 01:42:26,671
every day for three years.

1557
01:42:26,671 --> 01:42:27,671
How things had changed!

1558
01:42:27,671 --> 01:42:28,671
Callum had gone up in the world and Dexter
had come down.

1559
01:42:28,671 --> 01:42:29,671
'Dexter, old friend, you're still alive,'
Callum said.

1560
01:42:29,671 --> 01:42:30,671
'It's been a long time since I've seen you.

1561
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:31,671
I stopped phoning you because you never returned
my calls.'

1562
01:42:31,671 --> 01:42:32,671
'Didn't I?'

1563
01:42:32,671 --> 01:42:33,671
Dexter said.

1564
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:34,671
'Well, you know, I've been very busy with
my television programmes.'

1565
01:42:34,671 --> 01:42:35,671
He tried to sound confident.

1566
01:42:35,671 --> 01:42:36,671
'And are you still on television?

1567
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:37,671
I haven't seen you on TV for a long time,'
Callum said.

1568
01:42:37,671 --> 01:42:38,671
'I'm usually in programmes for sophisticated,
late-night viewers,' Dexter said uncomfortably.

1569
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:39,671
'Mm.

1570
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:40,671
Perhaps you need a new career opportunity,'
Callum said.

1571
01:42:40,671 --> 01:42:41,671
'You could work for me, Dex.

1572
01:42:41,671 --> 01:42:42,671
I need a new manager.

1573
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:43,671
Come and see me soon.

1574
01:42:43,671 --> 01:42:44,671
I'll buy you a good lunch - not sandwiches.

1575
01:42:44,671 --> 01:42:45,671
We'll talk about it.

1576
01:42:45,671 --> 01:42:46,671
Now, let's go and find your lovely girlfriend.

1577
01:42:46,671 --> 01:42:47,671
I saw you with her earlier and I want to meet
her.

1578
01:42:47,671 --> 01:42:48,671
Have you seen my girlfriend?

1579
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:49,671
I won't ask you to meet her, I'm getting rid
of her soon.'

1580
01:42:49,671 --> 01:42:50,671
Much later in the afternoon, Dexter finally
met up with Emma.

1581
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:51,671
'Let's go somewhere quiet,' he said.

1582
01:42:51,671 --> 01:42:52,671
'I want to talk to you.'

1583
01:42:52,671 --> 01:42:53,671
'Where's somewhere quiet?'

1584
01:42:53,671 --> 01:42:54,671
Emma asked him.

1585
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:55,671
'Well, there's a maze here, I believe,' said
Dexter.

1586
01:42:55,671 --> 01:42:56,671
'It's a large one.

1587
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:57,671
It would be nice to get lost in it.'

1588
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:58,671
They found the entrance to the maze and they
walked inside.

1589
01:42:58,671 --> 01:42:59,671
They didn't stop until they reached the centre.

1590
01:42:59,671 --> 01:43:00,671
Then they turned to face each other.

1591
01:43:00,671 --> 01:43:01,671
'Well, isn't it strange?'

1592
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:02,671
Emma began.

1593
01:43:02,671 --> 01:43:03,671
'These days, we only talk at other people's
weddings.'

1594
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:04,671
'I'm sorry that I've been so obnoxious during
these last few years,' Dexter said quietly.

1595
01:43:04,671 --> 01:43:05,671
'I don't blame you for ending our friendship.

1596
01:43:05,671 --> 01:43:06,671
But I want us to be friends again now.'

1597
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:07,671
'I'm sorry too, Dex,' Emma replied.

1598
01:43:07,671 --> 01:43:08,671
'Perhaps I didn't understand how badly your
mother's death had hurt you.

1599
01:43:08,671 --> 01:43:09,671
I didn't wait for you to start feeling better.

1600
01:43:09,671 --> 01:43:10,671
We were both to blame.'

1601
01:43:10,671 --> 01:43:11,671
'I'm a different person now, Em,' Dexter said.

1602
01:43:11,671 --> 01:43:12,671
'Sylvie has changed me.

1603
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:13,671
I love her very much.'

1604
01:43:13,671 --> 01:43:14,671
He stopped speaking for a moment.

1605
01:43:14,671 --> 01:43:15,671
'Emma, there's going to be another wedding
soon,' he went on.

1606
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:16,671
'Sylvie and I are going to get married later
this year.

1607
01:43:16,671 --> 01:43:17,671
And Sylvie is going to have a baby.'

1608
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:18,671
For another moment they didn't speak, but
their faces showed their real feelings.

1609
01:43:18,671 --> 01:43:19,671
Then Emma knew that she had to say something
to hide her fee lings, at least.

1610
01:43:19,671 --> 01:43:20,671
'She's a lovely girl, Dex,' Emma said.

1611
01:43:20,671 --> 01:43:21,671
'It's marvellous news.'

1612
01:43:21,671 --> 01:43:22,671
'I think that fatherhood will transform my
life,' Dexter replied.

1613
01:43:22,671 --> 01:43:23,671
'I've almost stopped drinking already.

1614
01:43:23,671 --> 01:43:24,671
I'll be a good family man.'

1615
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:25,671
'Well, that's good,' said Emma.

1616
01:43:25,671 --> 01:43:26,671
She laughed.

1617
01:43:26,671 --> 01:43:27,671
'Of course, you've just ruined any chance
of future happiness for me, but it's all great

1618
01:43:27,671 --> 01:43:28,671
news.'

1619
01:43:28,671 --> 01:43:29,671
She stopped for a moment.

1620
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:30,671
'Don't worry,' she added.

1621
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:31,671
'I'm only joking.'

1622
01:43:31,671 --> 01:43:32,671
And then they both laughed.

1623
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:33,671
'The wedding will be in September,' said Dexter.

1624
01:43:33,671 --> 01:43:34,671
'Emma, will you help me write my speech for
the big day?'

1625
01:43:34,671 --> 01:43:35,671
'No, Dexter,' said Emma.

1626
01:43:35,671 --> 01:43:36,671
'Don't be an idiot.

1627
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:37,671
Just look into your heart and write.'

1628
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:38,671
Then they walked back towards the entrance
of the maze.

1629
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:39,671
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Pleasures of Fatherhood

1630
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:40,671
Saturday, 15th July 2000

1631
01:43:40,671 --> 01:43:41,671
Richmond, Surrey, England

1632
01:43:41,671 --> 01:43:42,671
Jasmine Alison Viola Mayhew - Dexter and Sylvie's
daughter - had been born on the third day

1633
01:43:42,671 --> 01:43:43,671
of the year.

1634
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:44,671
She was always going to be the same age as
the century.

1635
01:43:44,671 --> 01:43:45,671
Dexter loved her dearly.

1636
01:43:45,671 --> 01:43:46,671
He wanted to do everything that was best for
her.

1637
01:43:46,671 --> 01:43:47,671
After work on 15th July, he was hurrying home
to the pretty house in Richmond where he and

1638
01:43:47,671 --> 01:43:48,671
his wife and daughter lived.

1639
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:49,671
Richmond was ten miles west of London, so
Dexter was no longer a Londoner.

1640
01:43:49,671 --> 01:43:50,671
His flat in Belsize Park was rented to someone
else.

1641
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:51,671
Dexter really had almost given up alcohol.

1642
01:43:51,671 --> 01:43:52,671
That was something he was proud of.

1643
01:43:52,671 --> 01:43:53,671
He often felt pressure to have just a small
drink, but he rarely gave in to it.

1644
01:43:53,671 --> 01:43:54,671
He had given in to pressure about something
else.

1645
01:43:54,671 --> 01:43:55,671
The pressure had come from Sylvie, who wanted
him to find a real job.

1646
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:56,671
He had been getting very little TV work in
the last year, so finally he agreed to have

1647
01:43:56,671 --> 01:43:57,671
a meeting with Callum.

1648
01:43:57,671 --> 01:43:58,671
Sylvie really liked Callum and Callum wanted
to help them.

1649
01:43:58,671 --> 01:43:59,671
Callum had given Dexter a job.

1650
01:43:59,671 --> 01:44:00,671
One day, it might become a very good job but
at the moment Dexter wasn't enjoying it.

1651
01:44:00,671 --> 01:44:01,671
The problem was that Dexter had to 'start
at the bottom', as Callum said.

1652
01:44:01,671 --> 01:44:02,671
He had to make sandwiches.

1653
01:44:02,671 --> 01:44:03,671
He had to sell sandwiches in the shops.

1654
01:44:03,671 --> 01:44:04,671
He had to drive a van around London.

1655
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:05,671
It was very menial work.

1656
01:44:05,671 --> 01:44:06,671
The worst thing about it was that he was frequently
recognized by people.

1657
01:44:06,671 --> 01:44:07,671
Customers in the shops often asked him why
he was no longer on TV and that hurt him.

1658
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:08,671
He also worried that Sylvie was disappointed
in him.

1659
01:44:08,671 --> 01:44:09,671
She had pressured him about the job but he
felt she was angry that his TV career had

1660
01:44:09,671 --> 01:44:10,671
ended.

1661
01:44:10,671 --> 01:44:11,671
He worried that she was no longer very interested
in him.

1662
01:44:11,671 --> 01:44:12,671
They often argued these days.

1663
01:44:12,671 --> 01:44:13,671
And they hadn't made love for weeks.

1664
01:44:13,671 --> 01:44:14,671
Dexter was thinking about all this as he arrived
home.

1665
01:44:14,671 --> 01:44:15,671
But tonight he was going to prove to Sylvie
that he was a new person.

1666
01:44:15,671 --> 01:44:16,671
Tonight he was going to look after Jasmine
alone while Sylvie went out with friends.

1667
01:44:16,671 --> 01:44:17,671
It was going to be the first time Sylvie had
left the baby for more than a few minutes.

1668
01:44:17,671 --> 01:44:18,671
'I'm going out for a meal in Central London
with some of my girlfriends,' Sylvie had told

1669
01:44:18,671 --> 01:44:19,671
him.

1670
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:20,671
'Then we'll stay at a hotel overnight.

1671
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:21,671
I'll be back the next morning.

1672
01:44:21,671 --> 01:44:22,671
It will be all right, you'll see.'

1673
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:23,671
'Yes, it will be all right,' Dexter told himself
now.

1674
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:24,671
Sylvie looked tired and unhappy when Dexter
entered the house.

1675
01:44:24,671 --> 01:44:25,671
'What's wrong, darling?' he asked her.

1676
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:26,671
'Oh, it's just been a bad day,' she replied.

1677
01:44:26,671 --> 01:44:27,671
'Jasmine hasn't slept at all.

1678
01:44:27,671 --> 01:44:28,671
She's been crying all day.

1679
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:29,671
And life in the house gets very boring when
you aren't here.

1680
01:44:29,671 --> 01:44:30,671
I'll feel better when I get out of the house
tonight.

1681
01:44:30,671 --> 01:44:31,671
Now, are you sure you'll be all right on your
own with Jasmine?'

1682
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:32,671
She tried to sound friendly, but Dexter knew
that she didn't really trust him.

1683
01:44:32,671 --> 01:44:33,671
'She thinks I'll start drinking,' he told
himself.

1684
01:44:33,671 --> 01:44:34,671
'But I will not!

1685
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:35,671
I will certainly not!'

1686
01:44:35,671 --> 01:44:36,671
'We'll be fine,' he said.

1687
01:44:36,671 --> 01:44:37,671
'Don't worry about us.'

1688
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:38,671
'If there's a problem, call me,' Sylvie said.

1689
01:44:38,671 --> 01:44:39,671
'But call my mobile, not the hotel number.

1690
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:40,671
Do you understand?'

1691
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:41,671
From the beginning, Dexter's evening was a
disaster.

1692
01:44:41,671 --> 01:44:42,671
Moments after Sylvie left the house, Jasmine
started to scream and she didn't stop.

1693
01:44:42,671 --> 01:44:43,671
She missed her mother.

1694
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,671
She didn't let Dexter feed her.

1695
01:44:44,671 --> 01:44:45,671
Soon there was baby food all over her clothes
and she was wet through.

1696
01:44:45,671 --> 01:44:46,671
Dexter changed her clothes and laid her down,
but she refused to go to sleep.

1697
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:47,671
Then she screamed when Dexter turned on the
television and saw the face of Suki Meadows.

1698
01:44:47,671 --> 01:44:48,671
Jasmine's scream was even louder than Suki's
voice.

1699
01:44:48,671 --> 01:44:49,671
Soon Dexter was desperate.

1700
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:50,671
And soon he was walking to the wine shop in
the next street, with Jasmine in his arms.

1701
01:44:50,671 --> 01:44:51,671
When he returned home, Dexter opened one of
the bottles of wine he had bought.

1702
01:44:51,671 --> 01:44:52,671
As he drank, Jasmine finally went to sleep.

1703
01:44:52,671 --> 01:44:53,671
Dexter began to feel calmer, but he didn't
stop drinking.

1704
01:44:53,671 --> 01:44:54,671
He looked at the baby food, the baby clothes
and the baby toys that were all around him.

1705
01:44:54,671 --> 01:44:55,671
He felt trapped.

1706
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:56,671
He drank some more wine.

1707
01:44:56,671 --> 01:44:57,671
'I need to talk to someone,' he told himself.

1708
01:44:57,671 --> 01:44:58,671
He tried to phone Emma Morley, but she didn't
answer her phone.

1709
01:44:58,671 --> 01:44:59,671
He waited for a few minutes and tried again.

1710
01:44:59,671 --> 01:45:00,671
Still she didn't answer.

1711
01:45:00,671 --> 01:45:01,671
Much later, and feeling desperate, he called
Suki Meadows.

1712
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:02,671
'Hi, Suki, it's me - Dex,' he said.

1713
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:03,671
'I saw you on TV earlier.

1714
01:45:03,671 --> 01:45:04,671
You were great.'

1715
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:05,671
'DEX, HEY THERE!

1716
01:45:05,671 --> 01:45:06,671
WELL, HOW ABOUT ALL THIS?

1717
01:45:06,671 --> 01:45:07,671
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU FOR A LONG TIME,'
Suki shouted.

1718
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:08,671
Suddenly she spoke quietly.

1719
01:45:08,671 --> 01:45:09,671
'In fact, it's been five years since we spoke.'

1720
01:45:09,671 --> 01:45:10,671
'Where are you, Suki?'

1721
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:11,671
Dexter asked her.

1722
01:45:11,671 --> 01:45:12,671
'I'd love to see you.

1723
01:45:12,671 --> 01:45:13,671
There's so much to talk about.

1724
01:45:13,671 --> 01:45:14,671
I want us to be friends again.

1725
01:45:14,671 --> 01:45:15,671
Will you come to my house?

1726
01:45:15,671 --> 01:45:16,671
Get a taxi - I'll pay for it.'

1727
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:17,671
'I'm at a party with some friends,' Suki said,
still speaking quietly.

1728
01:45:17,671 --> 01:45:18,671
'I'm not free.

1729
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:19,671
When we were together, you treated me really
badly.

1730
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:20,671
Do you remember that?

1731
01:45:20,671 --> 01:45:21,671
You can't just phone me after five years and
tell me to come to you.'

1732
01:45:21,671 --> 01:45:22,671
At that moment, Jasmine woke up and started
crying again.

1733
01:45:22,671 --> 01:45:23,671
'What was that noise?'

1734
01:45:23,671 --> 01:45:24,671
Suki asked.

1735
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:25,671
'It's a baby... it's my daughter, Jasmine,'
Dexter said nervously.

1736
01:45:25,671 --> 01:45:26,671
'Didn't you know I had a daughter?

1737
01:45:26,671 --> 01:45:27,671
I married someone and -'

1738
01:45:27,671 --> 01:45:28,671
Suki said several very rude words and then
ended the call suddenly.

1739
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:29,671
Dexter opened the other bottle.

1740
01:45:29,671 --> 01:45:30,671
Just before midnight, Sylvie used her mobile
phone to call Dexter.

1741
01:45:30,671 --> 01:45:31,671
She was sitting naked on the bed in her hotel
room.

1742
01:45:31,671 --> 01:45:32,671
They spoke for a few minutes, then Sylvie
ended the conversation and began to cry.

1743
01:45:32,671 --> 01:45:33,671
'He was drunk,' she said to Callum O'Neill,
who was sitting beside her.

1744
01:45:33,671 --> 01:45:34,671
'I knew he was going to be drunk.'

1745
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:35,671
'Well, I've given him a job, there's nothing
else I can do about him,' Callum said.

1746
01:45:35,671 --> 01:45:36,671
'The question is - what are you going to do
about him?

1747
01:45:36,671 --> 01:45:37,671
And when are you going to do it?'

1748
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:38,671
He turned on the television angrily and got
into bed.

1749
01:45:38,671 --> 01:45:39,671
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Another Man

1750
01:45:39,671 --> 01:45:40,671
Sunday, 15th July 2001

1751
01:45:40,671 --> 01:45:41,671
Paris, France

1752
01:45:41,671 --> 01:45:42,671
Emma was waiting at the Eurostar station in
Paris.

1753
01:45:42,671 --> 01:45:43,671
She was waiting for Dexter to arrive on a
train from London.

1754
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:44,671
She was a bit nervous.

1755
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:45,671
They had only seen each other once since his
marriage to Sylvie had broken up.

1756
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:46,671
On that occasion, they had spent the night
together.

1757
01:45:46,671 --> 01:45:47,671
That night, she had finally slept with him,
for the first and only time.

1758
01:45:47,671 --> 01:45:48,671
She thought now that it had probably been
a bad idea.

1759
01:45:48,671 --> 01:45:49,671
But he had been desperately unhappy and she
had wanted to help him in some way.

1760
01:45:49,671 --> 01:45:50,671
They'd both been a bit drunk.

1761
01:45:50,671 --> 01:45:51,671
Soon after, Emma had decided to get away from
England for a few months.

1762
01:45:51,671 --> 01:45:52,671
She had come to Paris for the spring and summer.

1763
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:53,671
She wanted to spend her time writing.

1764
01:45:53,671 --> 01:45:54,671
Her Julie Criscoll books were a great success
and her publisher wanted more.

1765
01:45:54,671 --> 01:45:55,671
Now Dexter was coming to visit her for a few
days and she hoped that they could both forget

1766
01:45:55,671 --> 01:45:56,671
about that night and be good friends again.

1767
01:45:56,671 --> 01:45:57,671
But she had something to tell Dexter and she
was worried.

1768
01:45:57,671 --> 01:45:58,671
The train arrived and a few moments later
Emma saw Dexter walking towards her.

1769
01:45:58,671 --> 01:45:59,671
He was carrying a book.

1770
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:00,671
He looked terrible - he'd lost weight and
his clothes were untidy and too big for him.

1771
01:46:00,671 --> 01:46:01,671
He looked desperately tired.

1772
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:02,671
The end of his marriage to Sylvie had hurt
Dexter a lot.

1773
01:46:02,671 --> 01:46:03,671
Their divorce was going to be made final soon.

1774
01:46:03,671 --> 01:46:04,671
Sylvie and Jasmine had now gone to live with
Callum O'Neill.

1775
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:05,671
That had made it worse for Dexter, of course.

1776
01:46:05,671 --> 01:46:06,671
'You didn't have to meet me,' Dexter said.

1777
01:46:06,671 --> 01:46:07,671
'Of course I had to meet you,' she said, smiling.

1778
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:08,671
'You're a tourist.'

1779
01:46:08,671 --> 01:46:09,671
The two friends left the station and went
to a cafe near the river.

1780
01:46:09,671 --> 01:46:10,671
They sat down at a table outside it and Emma
ordered coffee for them.

1781
01:46:10,671 --> 01:46:11,671
Dexter put the book he had been carrying on
the table.

1782
01:46:11,671 --> 01:46:12,671
It was a copy of Big Julie Criscoll Against
the Whole World.

1783
01:46:12,671 --> 01:46:13,671
'It's great, Em,' Dexter said.

1784
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:14,671
'I read it on the train.

1785
01:46:14,671 --> 01:46:15,671
I really enjoyed it.

1786
01:46:15,671 --> 01:46:16,671
It's the first novel I've finished in years.

1787
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:17,671
There were hundreds of copies in the bookshop
at the station in London.

1788
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:18,671
I'm really proud of you.'

1789
01:46:18,671 --> 01:46:19,671
'Well, thanks for that, but it's really a
book for eleven-to fourteen-year olds,' Emma

1790
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:20,671
said.

1791
01:46:20,671 --> 01:46:21,671
She laughed, but she was touched.

1792
01:46:21,671 --> 01:46:22,671
'The publisher wants two more Julie Criscoll
books and there's going to be a TV show based

1793
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:23,671
on them too,' she went on.

1794
01:46:23,671 --> 01:46:24,671
'I'm going to be...'

1795
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:25,671
She stopped when she saw Dexter's face and
started to talk about something else.

1796
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:26,671
They drank their coffee and then they walked
through the busy streets to Emma's flat.

1797
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:27,671
As they walked, Dexter told Emma that he missed
his daughter desperately.

1798
01:46:27,671 --> 01:46:28,671
He saw her only once a fortnight, when Sylvie
brought her to visit him.

1799
01:46:28,671 --> 01:46:29,671
Emma's flat was on the fifth floor of an old
building.

1800
01:46:29,671 --> 01:46:30,671
They climbed the stairs and Emma opened the
door.

1801
01:46:30,671 --> 01:46:31,671
The flat was light and pleasant.

1802
01:46:31,671 --> 01:46:32,671
Emma went to the kitchen and Dexter looked
into the other rooms.

1803
01:46:32,671 --> 01:46:33,671
There was only one bed in the flat - a big
one.

1804
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:34,671
Dexter saw the bed, sighed deeply, then he
hurried to the kitchen and put his arms round

1805
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:35,671
Emma.

1806
01:46:35,671 --> 01:46:36,671
He started to kiss her wildly.

1807
01:46:36,671 --> 01:46:37,671
But after a moment, she pushed him gently
away.

1808
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:38,671
'Dex, I have to tell you something,' Emma
said.

1809
01:46:38,671 --> 01:46:39,671
'I've got a friend here in Paris.

1810
01:46:39,671 --> 01:46:40,671
His name's Jean-Pierre.

1811
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:41,671
I like him very much.'

1812
01:46:41,671 --> 01:46:42,671
Suddenly Dexter understood.

1813
01:46:42,671 --> 01:46:43,671
'You're seeing another man?' he said.

1814
01:46:43,671 --> 01:46:44,671
'A French man?

1815
01:46:44,671 --> 01:46:45,671
Oh, right.

1816
01:46:45,671 --> 01:46:46,671
But where am I going to sleep?

1817
01:46:46,671 --> 01:46:47,671
I need to find a hotel, don't I?

1818
01:46:47,671 --> 01:46:48,671
Or shall I just go back to London this evening?'

1819
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:49,671
'You can sleep here, Dex.

1820
01:46:49,671 --> 01:46:50,671
I'll sleep at Jean-Pierre's flat,' Emma said.

1821
01:46:50,671 --> 01:46:51,671
Dexter just looked at her.

1822
01:46:51,671 --> 01:46:52,671
'Oh, Dexter, what did you think was going
to happen?'

1823
01:46:52,671 --> 01:46:53,671
'Well, we're lovers, aren't we?

1824
01:46:53,671 --> 01:46:54,671
I hoped that you and I...'

1825
01:46:54,671 --> 01:46:55,671
He stopped.

1826
01:46:55,671 --> 01:46:56,671
'Oh, Emma, you can't...

1827
01:46:56,671 --> 01:46:57,671
'

1828
01:46:57,671 --> 01:46:58,671
'Dexter, you're jealous,' Emma said laughing.

1829
01:46:58,671 --> 01:46:59,671
'I can't believe it.

1830
01:46:59,671 --> 01:47:00,671
This is so strange.

1831
01:47:00,671 --> 01:47:01,671
We were lovers for one night!

1832
01:47:01,671 --> 01:47:02,671
One night in thirteen years.

1833
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:03,671
Think of all the girlfriends you've brought
to see me.

1834
01:47:03,671 --> 01:47:04,671
You always told me who you were sleeping with.

1835
01:47:04,671 --> 01:47:05,671
You didn't expect me to be jealous of them.

1836
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:06,671
And now... and now...'

1837
01:47:06,671 --> 01:47:07,671
But she couldn't go on.

1838
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:08,671
She saw the pain and the hopelessness in his
eyes.

1839
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:09,671
She put her arms round him and kissed him
gently.

1840
01:47:09,671 --> 01:47:10,671
'Oh, Dexter,' she said quietly.

1841
01:47:10,671 --> 01:47:11,671
'I thought that I'd got rid of you.

1842
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:12,671
I thought that you weren't going to be my
problem anymore.

1843
01:47:12,671 --> 01:47:13,671
All right, all right.

1844
01:47:13,671 --> 01:47:14,671
I'll phone Jean-Pierre and tell him that I'm
ill.

1845
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:15,671
But Dexter, if you ever treat me badly and
go off with other people, I'll kill you.

1846
01:47:15,671 --> 01:47:16,671
Do you understand?'

1847
01:47:16,671 --> 01:47:17,671
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Monday Morning

1848
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:18,671
Monday, 15th July 2002

1849
01:47:18,671 --> 01:47:19,671
Belsize Park, London

1850
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:20,671
At seven o'clock in the morning, Dexter Mayhew
and Emma Morley were lying awake in bed.

1851
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:21,671
They were thinking their own thoughts.

1852
01:47:21,671 --> 01:47:22,671
They were now living together most of the
time.

1853
01:47:22,671 --> 01:47:23,671
Emma still kept her own flat, but at last
they were close friends and lovers as well,

1854
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:24,671
and really, life was good for them both.

1855
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:25,671
Emma's thoughts that morning were about the
15th July the previous year.

1856
01:47:25,671 --> 01:47:26,671
She thought about that and about what had
happened since then.

1857
01:47:26,671 --> 01:47:27,671
Dexter's visit to Paris had been difficult
at the start.

1858
01:47:27,671 --> 01:47:28,671
But she had quickly realized that she hadn't
really moved on from him and that probably

1859
01:47:28,671 --> 01:47:29,671
she wasn't able to move on from him.

1860
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:30,671
So she'd finished her relationship with her
French boyfriend.

1861
01:47:30,671 --> 01:47:31,671
Dexter had stayed with her in Paris for the
whole summer and they'd returned to London

1862
01:47:31,671 --> 01:47:32,671
as a couple.

1863
01:47:32,671 --> 01:47:33,671
These days, Emma usually slept in Dexter's
flat in Belsize Park and during the daytimes,

1864
01:47:33,671 --> 01:47:34,671
she went to her own flat, two miles away.

1865
01:47:34,671 --> 01:47:35,671
She rode there on her bicycle and wrote her
books there.

1866
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:36,671
Emma's series of books about Julie Criscoll
was selling very well.

1867
01:47:36,671 --> 01:47:37,671
The television version of them was popular
too, so Emma was almost rich now.

1868
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:38,671
During the daytimes, Dexter now ran a successful
delicatessen and cafe in Highgate, another

1869
01:47:38,671 --> 01:47:39,671
fashionable part of north London.

1870
01:47:39,671 --> 01:47:40,671
Emma knew that he had hated doing menial jobs
when he worked for Callum O'Neill.

1871
01:47:40,671 --> 01:47:41,671
But now he seemed to enjoy doing the same
jobs for himself.

1872
01:47:41,671 --> 01:47:42,671
He enjoyed making the sandwiches and coffee
for his customers at the deli.

1873
01:47:42,671 --> 01:47:43,671
Most of the time, Emma was confident about
their future.

1874
01:47:43,671 --> 01:47:44,671
She loved Dexter and she loved his daughter
Jasmine, who often spent time with them.

1875
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:45,671
The three of them were happy together.

1876
01:47:45,671 --> 01:47:46,671
This was good for Jasmine, because Sylvie
and Callum were not getting on well together.

1877
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:47,671
But there was one little cloud in Emma's sky.

1878
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:48,671
She was beginning to wish for a child of her
own.

1879
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:49,671
And she wasn't getting any younger, of course.

1880
01:47:49,671 --> 01:47:50,671
Dexter already had a child and he wasn't so
happy with the idea of another one.

1881
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:51,671
Sometimes they argued about this.

1882
01:47:51,671 --> 01:47:52,671
'Perhaps I need to find someone else,' Emma
sometimes thought when this happened.

1883
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:53,671
But she never thought very seriously about
leaving Dexter.

1884
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:54,671
One day, Emma had met Dexter's father again.

1885
01:47:54,671 --> 01:47:55,671
She remembered that meeting this morning.

1886
01:47:55,671 --> 01:47:56,671
'Of course I remember you, Emma,' Stephen
Mayhew had said.

1887
01:47:56,671 --> 01:47:57,671
'You called me a bourgeois fascist once.

1888
01:47:57,671 --> 01:47:58,671
I'm very pleased to meet you again.'

1889
01:47:58,671 --> 01:47:59,671
And he'd told her, 'Dexter is so much better
now that he has you with him.

1890
01:47:59,671 --> 01:48:00,671
Suddenly, I like my own son again.

1891
01:48:00,671 --> 01:48:01,671
It's wonderful.'

1892
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:02,671
Now, as Emma stopped remembering things and
started to get up, Dexter spoke.

1893
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:03,671
'Why do you still keep your own flat, Emma?'
he said.

1894
01:48:03,671 --> 01:48:04,671
'You can live here all the time.

1895
01:48:04,671 --> 01:48:05,671
You know that.'

1896
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:06,671
'Dexter, are you asking me to be your flatmate?'

1897
01:48:06,671 --> 01:48:07,671
Emma replied, pretending to be surprised.

1898
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:08,671
'It's taken you a lot of years, hasn't it?'

1899
01:48:08,671 --> 01:48:09,671
'Yes, I think I am,' Dexter said.

1900
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:10,671
'And, yes it has.

1901
01:48:10,671 --> 01:48:11,671
But that's what I want.'

1902
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:12,671
'The flat's really too small, Dex,' Emma said
after a few moments.

1903
01:48:12,671 --> 01:48:13,671
'Well, let's buy a house together, Em,' Dexter
said.

1904
01:48:13,671 --> 01:48:14,671
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1905
01:48:14,671 --> 01:48:15,671
Tuesday, 15th July 2003

1906
01:48:15,671 --> 01:48:16,671
Yorkshire, England

1907
01:48:16,671 --> 01:48:17,671
That's the place where I was bitten by a dog
when I was a little girl,' Emma said.

1908
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:18,671
She pointed ahead.

1909
01:48:18,671 --> 01:48:19,671
She and Dexter were walking along a beach
on the Yorkshire coast.

1910
01:48:19,671 --> 01:48:20,671
The morning was hot, but there weren't many
people on the beach.

1911
01:48:20,671 --> 01:48:21,671
The school holidays hadn't begun yet.

1912
01:48:21,671 --> 01:48:22,671
'What kind of dog was it?'

1913
01:48:22,671 --> 01:48:23,671
Dexter asked.

1914
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:24,671
He was trying too hard to sound interested.

1915
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:25,671
Emma looked carefully at him.

1916
01:48:25,671 --> 01:48:26,671
Clearly, he didn't really want to know what
kind of dog had bitten her.

1917
01:48:26,671 --> 01:48:27,671
'Am I boring you, Dexter?'

1918
01:48:27,671 --> 01:48:28,671
she asked.

1919
01:48:28,671 --> 01:48:29,671
She sounded a bit cross.

1920
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:30,671
'No, of course you aren't,' Dexter replied
wearily.

1921
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:31,671
'Well, perhaps you are boring me a little
bit.'

1922
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:32,671
'Ah, then you have four more days of boredom
to look forward to, don't you?'

1923
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:33,671
Emma said.

1924
01:48:33,671 --> 01:48:34,671
She laughed.

1925
01:48:34,671 --> 01:48:35,671
She liked his sudden honesty.

1926
01:48:35,671 --> 01:48:36,671
'Poor Dexter,' she added.

1927
01:48:36,671 --> 01:48:37,671
Emma and Dexter were on holiday.

1928
01:48:37,671 --> 01:48:38,671
They had rented a small cottage in the Yorkshire
countryside for a week.

1929
01:48:38,671 --> 01:48:39,671
Each day they set out to visit places that
Emma remembered from when she was a child.

1930
01:48:39,671 --> 01:48:40,671
Today, after their morning at the beach, they
were going to drive inland.

1931
01:48:40,671 --> 01:48:41,671
Emma wanted to find a waterfall she remembered
from her childhood.

1932
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:42,671
'It's a beautiful place, Dex,' she said.

1933
01:48:42,671 --> 01:48:43,671
'You'll love it.'

1934
01:48:43,671 --> 01:48:44,671
But that afternoon, they didn't succeed in
their search.

1935
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:45,671
Emma's memory wasn't good enough.

1936
01:48:45,671 --> 01:48:46,671
After an hour they hadn't found Emma's waterfall.

1937
01:48:46,671 --> 01:48:47,671
So they found a pleasant spot in the sun and
lay down on the grass.

1938
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:48,671
Soon, Dexter was feeling a bit sleepy.

1939
01:48:48,671 --> 01:48:49,671
'Look at that bird up there, Dex,' Emma said
suddenly, pointing to the sky.

1940
01:48:49,671 --> 01:48:50,671
'What kind of bird is it?

1941
01:48:50,671 --> 01:48:51,671
It's beautiful!'

1942
01:48:51,671 --> 01:48:52,671
Dexter did not look up.

1943
01:48:52,671 --> 01:48:53,671
'I'm too young to be a birdwatcher,' he said.

1944
01:48:53,671 --> 01:48:54,671
'Birdwatching is for middle-aged people.

1945
01:48:54,671 --> 01:48:55,671
And isn't birdwatching a very bourgeois thing
to do?

1946
01:48:55,671 --> 01:48:56,671
Next, you'll want us to move to the country.

1947
01:48:56,671 --> 01:48:57,671
Then you'll want us to cuddle in bed and call
each other "darling" and go to the shops together.'

1948
01:48:57,671 --> 01:48:58,671
For a moment, Emma thought about Ian Whitehead.

1949
01:48:58,671 --> 01:48:59,671
Calling him 'darling' hadn't meant that she
really loved him, had it?

1950
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:00,671
'After that it's classical music - Beethoven
and that kind of thing,' Dexter went on.

1951
01:49:00,671 --> 01:49:01,671
'I've seen it happen to people, Em.

1952
01:49:01,671 --> 01:49:02,671
It's awful.'

1953
01:49:02,671 --> 01:49:03,671
Emma laughed and kissed him.

1954
01:49:03,671 --> 01:49:04,671
'It does sound awful.

1955
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:05,671
Tell me again - why are we going to get married?'

1956
01:49:05,671 --> 01:49:06,671
she said.

1957
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:07,671
'Well, we don't need to.

1958
01:49:07,671 --> 01:49:08,671
We could cancel the wedding,' Dexter said.

1959
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:09,671
'Yes, but we've paid for it now,' Emma said.

1960
01:49:09,671 --> 01:49:10,671
'Can we get our money back if we cancel it?'

1961
01:49:10,671 --> 01:49:11,671
'I don't think so,' Dexter replied.

1962
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:12,671
'Ah well, we'd better get married then,' said
Emma.

1963
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:13,671
'I knew there was a reason.'

1964
01:49:13,671 --> 01:49:14,671
And she kissed him again.

1965
01:49:14,671 --> 01:49:15,671
Then she closed her eyes and thought about
their wedding.

1966
01:49:15,671 --> 01:49:16,671
They had chosen a day in November for the
ceremony.

1967
01:49:16,671 --> 01:49:17,671
Only a few close friends were going to be
there.

1968
01:49:17,671 --> 01:49:18,671
And finally she was going to be Emma Mayhew,
after all these years.

1969
01:49:18,671 --> 01:49:19,671
'I'll marry you if you promise you'll never
play golf,' she whispered.

1970
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:20,671
That evening, they went to bed early.

1971
01:49:20,671 --> 01:49:21,671
Emma quickly went to sleep, but Dexter couldn't
sleep so he got up quietly and went downstairs.

1972
01:49:21,671 --> 01:49:22,671
He was thinking about Emma and about their
big day in November.

1973
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:23,671
He was going to make a speech at the wedding
party.

1974
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:24,671
He needed it to be just right.

1975
01:49:24,671 --> 01:49:25,671
Suddenly, he remembered something that Emma
had once said to him.

1976
01:49:25,671 --> 01:49:26,671
He turned on his laptop and opened a file.

1977
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:27,671
Then he looked into his heart and made some
notes:

1978
01:49:27,671 --> 01:49:28,671
My wedding speech

1979
01:49:28,671 --> 01:49:29,671
1) I met Emma at University.

1980
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:30,671
2) She called my dad a bourgeois fascist.

1981
01:49:30,671 --> 01:49:31,671
3) She can't cook.

1982
01:49:31,671 --> 01:49:32,671
4) We argue a lot - but laugh a lot too.

1983
01:49:32,671 --> 01:49:33,671
5) She's beautiful but she doesn't believe
it.

1984
01:49:33,671 --> 01:49:34,671
6) She gets on well with my lovely daughter,
Jasmine.

1985
01:49:34,671 --> 01:49:35,671
7) She even gets on well with my ex-wife.

1986
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:36,671
Ha, ha!

1987
01:49:36,671 --> 01:49:37,671
(Leave five seconds for laughter here.)

1988
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:38,671
8) Everyone loves her.

1989
01:49:38,671 --> 01:49:39,671
9) Our sudden romance lasted 15 years.

1990
01:49:39,671 --> 01:49:40,671
10) My wonderful mum loved Emma.

1991
01:49:40,671 --> 01:49:41,671
ALSO...

1992
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:42,671
11) Say something nice about Dad and about
Emma's parents.

1993
01:49:42,671 --> 01:49:43,671
12) Say that it's my second wedding and I
need to get it right this time, etc.

1994
01:49:43,671 --> 01:49:44,671
He was reading what he had written when he
heard Emma's footsteps on the stairs.

1995
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:45,671
He gave the file a name - bigdayspeech.doc
- and closed it.

1996
01:49:45,671 --> 01:49:46,671
'Sorry, I fell asleep,' Emma said from the
bottom of the stairs.

1997
01:49:46,671 --> 01:49:47,671
'But I'm awake now.

1998
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:48,671
What shall we do?'

1999
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:49,671
'I think I'd like to play a board game,' said
Dexter and he smiled.

2000
01:49:49,671 --> 01:49:50,671
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Too Late

2001
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:51,671
Thursday, 15th July 2004

2002
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:52,671
Belsize Park, London

2003
01:49:52,671 --> 01:49:53,671
It was breakfast time in Belsize Park.

2004
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:54,671
'Well, it didn't happen this month, Dex,'
Emma said sadly.

2005
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:55,671
'I'm sorry.'

2006
01:49:55,671 --> 01:49:56,671
'Please don't worry about it, Em,' Dexter
said.

2007
01:49:56,671 --> 01:49:57,671
'We'll go on trying.'

2008
01:49:57,671 --> 01:49:58,671
'I'll be thirty-nine next April,' Emma replied.

2009
01:49:58,671 --> 01:49:59,671
'Soon it will be too late.'

2010
01:49:59,671 --> 01:50:00,671
Dexter now wanted a baby as much as she did.

2011
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:01,671
But it wasn't happening.

2012
01:50:01,671 --> 01:50:02,671
They were both beginning to worry.

2013
01:50:02,671 --> 01:50:03,671
'It really doesn't matter,' Emma told herself.

2014
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:04,671
'We're a happily married couple.

2015
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:05,671
That's the important thing.

2016
01:50:05,671 --> 01:50:06,671
And Jasmine's here a lot.'

2017
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:07,671
She told herself this, but there was a hole
in her life now.

2018
01:50:07,671 --> 01:50:08,671
It made her sad and sometimes it made her
cross with Dexter for no real reason.

2019
01:50:08,671 --> 01:50:09,671
This morning she tried to be calm, but she
was quickly upset by something in the newspaper.

2020
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:10,671
'Dex, I don't understand students these days,'
she said.

2021
01:50:10,671 --> 01:50:11,671
'They don't care about anything, do they?

2022
01:50:11,671 --> 01:50:12,671
When I was a student, we protested about things
like this.'

2023
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:13,671
She put the newspaper down in front of him
and pointed at a story.

2024
01:50:13,671 --> 01:50:14,671
'Perhaps they're right not to protest,' said
Dexter wearily.

2025
01:50:14,671 --> 01:50:15,671
'We aren't all socialist feminist anti-fascists,
are we?

2026
01:50:15,671 --> 01:50:16,671
Some of us have other things to worry about.'

2027
01:50:16,671 --> 01:50:17,671
And that started the argument.

2028
01:50:17,671 --> 01:50:18,671
For ten minutes they were very rude to each
other.

2029
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:19,671
Then, quite suddenly, Emma didn't want to
argue any longer.

2030
01:50:19,671 --> 01:50:20,671
'I'm sorry, Dexter,' she said.

2031
01:50:20,671 --> 01:50:21,671
'This isn't about students, is it?

2032
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:22,671
It's about not having a baby.

2033
01:50:22,671 --> 01:50:23,671
I'm really upset about it.

2034
01:50:23,671 --> 01:50:24,671
I don't want to fight with you.'

2035
01:50:24,671 --> 01:50:25,671
By the time they left the house they were
almost friends again.

2036
01:50:25,671 --> 01:50:26,671
Emma was going to her flat to write.

2037
01:50:26,671 --> 01:50:27,671
Dexter was going to the deli, but he wasn't
in a hurry.

2038
01:50:27,671 --> 01:50:28,671
He now had help there.

2039
01:50:28,671 --> 01:50:29,671
A pleasant girl called Maddy worked as his
manager.

2040
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:30,671
And a few other people helped at busy times.

2041
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:31,671
'There's a house that I want us to look at
this afternoon,' Dexter said as they left

2042
01:50:31,671 --> 01:50:32,671
the flat.

2043
01:50:32,671 --> 01:50:33,671
'We really must buy one soon and I've got
a good feeling about this one.

2044
01:50:33,671 --> 01:50:34,671
I'll phone you with the address later.

2045
01:50:34,671 --> 01:50:35,671
It's in Kilburn.

2046
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:36,671
Meet me at the house at five o'clock.'

2047
01:50:36,671 --> 01:50:37,671
So Emma got on her bicycle and rode off to
do her day's work.

2048
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:38,671
At about lunchtime, Dexter phoned with the
address where they were going to meet.

2049
01:50:38,671 --> 01:50:39,671
'I'll see you there, darling,' Emma said.

2050
01:50:39,671 --> 01:50:40,671
'I'm sorry about this morning.

2051
01:50:40,671 --> 01:50:41,671
I love you.'

2052
01:50:41,671 --> 01:50:42,671
At four o'clock, Emma set off from her flat
to cycle to Kilburn.

2053
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:43,671
It started to rain and soon the roads were
wet.

2054
01:50:43,671 --> 01:50:44,671
There was lots of traffic noise.

2055
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:45,671
Emma didn't hear the car that came out of
a side street at high speed.

2056
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:46,671
So she was surprised to be flying through
the air.

2057
01:50:46,671 --> 01:50:47,671
She landed by the side of the road.

2058
01:50:47,671 --> 01:50:48,671
When she opened her eyes, there were people
standing round her.

2059
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:49,671
'Are you all right, Miss?' one of them asked.

2060
01:50:49,671 --> 01:50:50,671
Another was crying.

2061
01:50:50,671 --> 01:50:51,671
But Emma didn't speak.

2062
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:52,671
She knew that she was certainly not all right.

2063
01:50:52,671 --> 01:50:53,671
Two thoughts passed through her mind as she
lay on the ground.

2064
01:50:53,671 --> 01:50:54,671
One was a memory of herself playing on a Yorkshire
beach.

2065
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:55,671
She was with her parents and she was nine
years old.

2066
01:50:55,671 --> 01:50:56,671
The other thought was about Dexter.

2067
01:50:56,671 --> 01:50:57,671
She was going to be late for their meeting.

2068
01:50:57,671 --> 01:50:58,671
He was going to worry and he was going to
get wet.

2069
01:50:58,671 --> 01:50:59,671
Then Emma Mayhew died and everything she had
ever thought had gone.

2070
01:50:59,671 --> 01:51:00,671
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Three Anniversaries

2071
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:01,671
Friday, 15th July 2005

2072
01:51:01,671 --> 01:51:02,671
London, England

2073
01:51:02,671 --> 01:51:03,671
The months had passed.

2074
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:04,671
A year had passed.

2075
01:51:04,671 --> 01:51:05,671
Very early in the morning of 15th July 2005,
Dexter Mayhew was drinking in a club in Central

2076
01:51:05,671 --> 01:51:06,671
London.

2077
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:07,671
It was the kind of club that stayed open very
late.

2078
01:51:07,671 --> 01:51:08,671
Dexter was alone.

2079
01:51:08,671 --> 01:51:09,671
Earlier, he had come to the club with Maddy,
his manager, and two of the other workers

2080
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:10,671
from his deli.

2081
01:51:10,671 --> 01:51:11,671
Dexter had wanted them all to drink to the
memory of Emma at exactly midnight, at the

2082
01:51:11,671 --> 01:51:12,671
beginning of her anniversary day.

2083
01:51:12,671 --> 01:51:13,671
They had gladly come with him.

2084
01:51:13,671 --> 01:51:14,671
But soon after midnight the others had left
the club.

2085
01:51:14,671 --> 01:51:15,671
They needed to go home.

2086
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:16,671
Maddy had tried to make Dexter go home too,
but he'd wanted to stay, and Maddy had left.

2087
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:17,671
Now Dexter was very drunk.

2088
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:18,671
Finally, Dexter left and walked to another
club, where he continued drinking.

2089
01:51:18,671 --> 01:51:19,671
Soon he got into a fight.

2090
01:51:19,671 --> 01:51:20,671
He knew that he wasn't going to win the fight.

2091
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:21,671
He didn't want to win the fight.

2092
01:51:21,671 --> 01:51:22,671
He wanted to die.

2093
01:51:22,671 --> 01:51:23,671
The fight ended with Dexter lying unconscious
in the street.

2094
01:51:23,671 --> 01:51:24,671
When he woke, he found that someone had stolen
his money and his keys.

2095
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:25,671
There was blood all over his clothes.

2096
01:51:25,671 --> 01:51:26,671
Somehow, he found his way back to Belsize
Park.

2097
01:51:26,671 --> 01:51:27,671
But outside his front door, he realized that
he couldn't get into the flat without his

2098
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:28,671
keys.

2099
01:51:28,671 --> 01:51:29,671
He lay down and went to sleep on the ground.

2100
01:51:29,671 --> 01:51:30,671
Sylvie found him unconscious there in the
morning when she brought Jasmine for a visit.

2101
01:51:30,671 --> 01:51:31,671
Sylvie had ended her relationship with Callum
O'Neill and Dexter now got on quite well with

2102
01:51:31,671 --> 01:51:32,671
his ex-wife.

2103
01:51:32,671 --> 01:51:33,671
When she found Dexter outside his door, she
phoned his father.

2104
01:51:33,671 --> 01:51:34,671
She had her own keys, so she took Dexter into
the flat and washed him and found him some

2105
01:51:34,671 --> 01:51:35,671
clean clothes.

2106
01:51:35,671 --> 01:51:36,671
Later, Stephen Mayhew arrived and took Dexter
back to Oxfordshire.

2107
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:37,671
Now that they had both lost their wives, they
understood each other better.

2108
01:51:37,671 --> 01:51:38,671
Dexter's father was gentle with him.

2109
01:51:38,671 --> 01:51:39,671
Saturday, 15th July 2006

2110
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:40,671
London, England

2111
01:51:40,671 --> 01:51:41,671
The months had passed.

2112
01:51:41,671 --> 01:51:42,671
Another year had passed.

2113
01:51:42,671 --> 01:51:43,671
For Dexter, the second anniversary of Emma's
death wasn't as painful as the first one.

2114
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:44,671
When the deli closed for the day, he decided
to spend the evening alone.

2115
01:51:44,671 --> 01:51:45,671
He wanted to look through Emma's books and
photographs.

2116
01:51:45,671 --> 01:51:46,671
He was going to keep some of them.

2117
01:51:46,671 --> 01:51:47,671
He was going to give some of them to her parents.

2118
01:51:47,671 --> 01:51:48,671
The others were going to her friends.

2119
01:51:48,671 --> 01:51:49,671
So in the evening, he sat with Emma's things
around him.

2120
01:51:49,671 --> 01:51:50,671
He thought about the previous anniversary
and he remembered a strange thing.

2121
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:51,671
A few days after 15th July last year, he'd
received a kind letter from Ian Whitehead.

2122
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:52,671
'When Emma left me, I hated you,' he had written.

2123
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:53,671
'I wanted to die.

2124
01:51:53,671 --> 01:51:54,671
But after a few years I met someone else and
my life changed.

2125
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:55,671
And now I'm happy again.

2126
01:51:55,671 --> 01:51:56,671
We have three children.

2127
01:51:56,671 --> 01:51:57,671
I know how you must feel without Emma, Dexter.

2128
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:58,671
And I know that she loved you very, very much.

2129
01:51:58,671 --> 01:51:59,671
I used to think that you weren't good enough
for her.

2130
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:00,671
But none of us was good enough for Emma.

2131
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:01,671
And we have to go on for her.

2132
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:02,671
Please take care of yourself.'

2133
01:52:02,671 --> 01:52:03,671
After that letter, Dexter and Ian had spoken
on the phone a few times.

2134
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:04,671
But they both knew that they weren't going
to meet again.

2135
01:52:04,671 --> 01:52:05,671
Dexter spent a lot of the evening looking
at Emma's old photos.

2136
01:52:05,671 --> 01:52:06,671
He found some which Emma had taken on Arthur's

2137
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:07,671
Seat in Edinburgh.

2138
01:52:07,671 --> 01:52:08,671
One of them had been taken by someone else
and showed both Emma and Dexter.

2139
01:52:08,671 --> 01:52:09,671
These photos had been taken on the first day
they had ever spent together.

2140
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:10,671
Suddenly, Dexter felt terrible.

2141
01:52:10,671 --> 01:52:11,671
There were so many memories.

2142
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:12,671
He started to cry, but he knew what to do.

2143
01:52:12,671 --> 01:52:13,671
He phoned his friend Maddy.

2144
01:52:13,671 --> 01:52:14,671
Talking to her made him calm again.

2145
01:52:14,671 --> 01:52:15,671
'Shall I come to you?'

2146
01:52:15,671 --> 01:52:16,671
she said.

2147
01:52:16,671 --> 01:52:17,671
'I can get a taxi.'

2148
01:52:17,671 --> 01:52:18,671
'No, it's all right.

2149
01:52:18,671 --> 01:52:19,671
I just wanted hear a friendly voice,' Dexter
told her.

2150
01:52:19,671 --> 01:52:20,671
'I'll be fine now.'

2151
01:52:20,671 --> 01:52:21,671
And soon, he felt much better.

2152
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:22,671
Sunday, 15th July 2007

2153
01:52:22,671 --> 01:52:23,671
Edinburgh, Scotland

2154
01:52:23,671 --> 01:52:24,671
The months had passed.

2155
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:25,671
One more year had passed.

2156
01:52:25,671 --> 01:52:26,671
On the third anniversary of Emma's death,
Dexter was in Edinburgh, with Maddy and Jasmine.

2157
01:52:26,671 --> 01:52:27,671
Dexter and Maddy were a couple now and they
were having a short holiday with Dexter's

2158
01:52:27,671 --> 01:52:28,671
daughter.

2159
01:52:28,671 --> 01:52:29,671
This morning, Maddy had told Dexter to take
Jasmine for a walk.

2160
01:52:29,671 --> 01:52:30,671
'I'll go to one of the art galleries,' she'd
said.

2161
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:31,671
She'd guessed that Dexter wanted to visit
places from his past.

2162
01:52:31,671 --> 01:52:32,671
She'd also guessed that he wanted to talk
to Jasmine about Emma.

2163
01:52:32,671 --> 01:52:33,671
Jasmine was seven years old now and she walked
happily beside Dexter.

2164
01:52:33,671 --> 01:52:34,671
First they walked to Rankeillor Street and
for a minute, Dexter looked up at the window

2165
01:52:34,671 --> 01:52:35,671
of the flat where Emma used to live.

2166
01:52:35,671 --> 01:52:36,671
Then they walked through the streets towards
Arthur's Seat.

2167
01:52:36,671 --> 01:52:37,671
'Let's do some climbing,' said Dexter when
they reached the hill.

2168
01:52:37,671 --> 01:52:38,671
'There's a wonderful view from the top.'

2169
01:52:38,671 --> 01:52:39,671
'Did Emma come up here too?'

2170
01:52:39,671 --> 01:52:40,671
Jasmine asked him when they reached the top.

2171
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,671
'Yes, we came here together,' Dexter replied.

2172
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:42,671
'I have a photo of us both on the hill.

2173
01:52:42,671 --> 01:52:43,671
I'll show you it when we get back to London.'

2174
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:44,671
'Do you miss Emma?'

2175
01:52:44,671 --> 01:52:45,671
Jasmine asked quietly.

2176
01:52:45,671 --> 01:52:46,671
'Yes, I miss her every day,' Dexter said.

2177
01:52:46,671 --> 01:52:47,671
'She was my best friend.

2178
01:52:47,671 --> 01:52:48,671
Do you miss her?'

2179
01:52:48,671 --> 01:52:49,671
'I think I miss her,' Jasmine said.

2180
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:50,671
'But I was only four when she died.

2181
01:52:50,671 --> 01:52:51,671
I don't remember her very well.

2182
01:52:51,671 --> 01:52:52,671
She was nice, wasn't she?'

2183
01:52:52,671 --> 01:52:53,671
'She was very nice,' Dexter said.

2184
01:52:53,671 --> 01:52:54,671
'Who's your best friend now, Daddy?'

2185
01:52:54,671 --> 01:52:55,671
asked Jasmine.

2186
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:56,671
'You are, of course,' Dexter replied quickly.

2187
01:52:56,671 --> 01:52:57,671
'Can we go down now?'

2188
01:52:57,671 --> 01:52:58,671
Jasmine said.

2189
01:52:58,671 --> 01:52:59,671
'I'm a bit tired.'

2190
01:52:59,671 --> 01:53:00,671
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The Past

2191
01:53:00,671 --> 01:53:01,671
Friday, 15th July 1988

2192
01:53:01,671 --> 01:53:02,671
Edinburgh, Scotland

2193
01:53:02,671 --> 01:53:03,671
Have you had someone in your room all night?'

2194
01:53:03,671 --> 01:53:04,671
Tilly Killick asked, when Emma Morley entered
the kitchen in their flat that morning.

2195
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:05,671
'Oh, yes, it's only Dexter Mayhew,' Emma replied.

2196
01:53:05,671 --> 01:53:06,671
She tried to sound uninterested.

2197
01:53:06,671 --> 01:53:07,671
She was not very successful.

2198
01:53:07,671 --> 01:53:08,671
'It's only Dexter Mayhew!

2199
01:53:08,671 --> 01:53:09,671
You lucky person,' Tilly said.

2200
01:53:09,671 --> 01:53:10,671
She sounded a little jealous.

2201
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:11,671
'Is he staying here all day too?'

2202
01:53:11,671 --> 01:53:12,671
'No, I think we'll go out after breakfast,'
Emma said.

2203
01:53:12,671 --> 01:53:13,671
'What shall we do?

2204
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:14,671
Have you any ideas for a romantic day, Tilly?'

2205
01:53:14,671 --> 01:53:15,671
'Well, Arthur's Seat is a good place to go,
isn't it?'

2206
01:53:15,671 --> 01:53:16,671
Tilly said.

2207
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:17,671
'You can be romantic there.'

2208
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:18,671
So after breakfast, Emma and Dexter went out
into the city.

2209
01:53:18,671 --> 01:53:19,671
Emma took her camera with her and they bought
food for a picnic.

2210
01:53:19,671 --> 01:53:20,671
Dexter was worried about climbing Arthur's
Seat.

2211
01:53:20,671 --> 01:53:21,671
He was wearing expensive shoes and he didn't
want to ruin them.

2212
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:22,671
'I don't climb mountains, Em,' he said.

2213
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,671
'I'm not that kind of person.'

2214
01:53:23,671 --> 01:53:24,671
'Dexter, it's only a hill, it's not K2,' Emma
replied, laughing.

2215
01:53:24,671 --> 01:53:25,671
So they climbed Arthur's Seat and when they
reached the top they decided that it wasn't

2216
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:26,671
really romantic.

2217
01:53:26,671 --> 01:53:27,671
There were too many people already there for
that.

2218
01:53:27,671 --> 01:53:28,671
But Dexter had never climbed the hill before
and he was surprised.

2219
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:29,671
He enjoyed the view.

2220
01:53:29,671 --> 01:53:30,671
It made an impression on him.

2221
01:53:30,671 --> 01:53:31,671
This didn't often happen.

2222
01:53:31,671 --> 01:53:32,671
'I've lived in this city for four years,'
he said.

2223
01:53:32,671 --> 01:53:33,671
'Now this is my last day in Edinburgh.

2224
01:53:33,671 --> 01:53:34,671
Why haven't I been up here before?'

2225
01:53:34,671 --> 01:53:35,671
'Because you're not that kind of person,'
Emma replied.

2226
01:53:35,671 --> 01:53:36,671
They ate their picnic and then they sat quietly
together.

2227
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:37,671
'Dexter,' Emma said after a few minutes, 'I
want to say something.

2228
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:38,671
It's about last night.

2229
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:39,671
I haven't done that kind of thing often and
I know that you were a bit drunk.

2230
01:53:39,671 --> 01:53:40,671
I know it was just one night, and that's it.

2231
01:53:40,671 --> 01:53:41,671
But I want to say that it was nice for me.

2232
01:53:41,671 --> 01:53:42,671
It was nice and you're nice, Dexter.

2233
01:53:42,671 --> 01:53:43,671
You're a nice person when you allow yourself
to be nice.

2234
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:44,671
I really like you.'

2235
01:53:44,671 --> 01:53:45,671
Later, on their way back to the bottom of
the hill, they stopped to take some photos.

2236
01:53:45,671 --> 01:53:46,671
Someone took a photo of both of them together.

2237
01:53:46,671 --> 01:53:47,671
Then Emma walked with Dexter back to his flat.

2238
01:53:47,671 --> 01:53:48,671
They found Dexter's parents waiting for him
there.

2239
01:53:48,671 --> 01:53:49,671
'This is my friend Emma Morley,' Dexter told
his parents.

2240
01:53:49,671 --> 01:53:50,671
'Hello Emma, I'm Alison,' Dexter's mother
said.

2241
01:53:50,671 --> 01:53:51,671
'We're pleased to meet you.

2242
01:53:51,671 --> 01:53:52,671
Do you want to come for a drink with us?'

2243
01:53:52,671 --> 01:53:53,671
Emma looked at Dexter.

2244
01:53:53,671 --> 01:53:54,671
He looked unhappy and worried.

2245
01:53:54,671 --> 01:53:55,671
She made a quick decision.

2246
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:56,671
'No, thank you,' she replied.

2247
01:53:56,671 --> 01:53:57,671
'That's very kind of you, but I have to get
back to my flat.'

2248
01:53:57,671 --> 01:53:58,671
Then she spoke to the boy.

2249
01:53:58,671 --> 01:53:59,671
'Have a nice life, Dexter,' she said quickly.

2250
01:53:59,671 --> 01:54:00,671
She turned and walked away.

2251
01:54:00,671 --> 01:54:01,671
'I'll probably never see him again,' she told
herself as she walked sadly along the street.

2252
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:02,671
But a few minutes later, as she walked through
the city centre, she heard someone call her

2253
01:54:02,671 --> 01:54:03,671
name behind her.

2254
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:04,671
She turned and saw Dexter.

2255
01:54:04,671 --> 01:54:05,671
He had been running and he was exhausted".

2256
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:06,671
'My parents came early,' he said.

2257
01:54:06,671 --> 01:54:07,671
'I didn't have time to get your address and
phone number.'

2258
01:54:07,671 --> 01:54:08,671
Quickly, Emma wrote these on a piece of paper
and Dexter wrote his address and phone number

2259
01:54:08,671 --> 01:54:09,671
for her.

2260
01:54:09,671 --> 01:54:10,671
'Call me when I get back from France,' he
said.

2261
01:54:10,671 --> 01:54:11,671
'Come and stay with us for a few days.

2262
01:54:11,671 --> 01:54:12,671
I want to see you again.'

2263
01:54:12,671 --> 01:54:13,671
Then he kissed her gently and she kissed him.

2264
01:54:13,671 --> 01:54:14,671
They stood in the middle of the busy street
and people on their way home hurried around

2265
01:54:14,671 --> 01:54:15,671
them.

2266
01:54:15,671 --> 01:54:16,671
It was the sweetest kiss either of them ever
knew.

2267
01:54:16,671 --> 01:54:17,671
'Goodbye, Dex,' Emma said.

2268
01:54:17,671 --> 01:54:18,671
'Goodbye.'

2269
01:54:18,671 --> 01:54:19,671
'Goodbye.

2270
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:20,671
Goodbye.'

2271
01:54:20,671 --> 01:54:20,673
- THE END -
