00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,120
CHAPTER ONE
A Departure and a Romantic Adventure

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,050
It was the last day of term at Miss Pinkerton's
academy.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,220
Miss Pinkerton was giving final instructions
to her sister, Miss Jemima.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,839
'Is everything ready for Miss Sedley?'

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,839
she asked grandly.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,369
'She will take the dictionary with her, of
course.'

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,539
Miss Pinkerton's academy was one of the finest
schools for young ladies.

8
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,689
The academy had been visited by the great
Dr Samuel Johnson.

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,160
He had also mentioned it in a poem.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,620
Miss Pinkerton could never resist mentioning
the great man's name, and she gave her pupils

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,420
a copy of his dictionary when they left the
school.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,120
'What about Becky Sharp?'

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Miss Jemima now asked.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,930
'Shall I give her a copy of the dictionary,
too?'

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,740
'Becky Sharp!'

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,790
Miss Pinkerton exclaimed angrily.

17
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,540
'We won't waste the dictionary on her.'

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,329
Becky Sharp was an orphan.

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,560
Her mother, a Frenchwoman, had died some years
previously.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,720
She had taught Becky French.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,069
Her father had been the school's art teacher.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,219
He was a talented man, but very fond of wild
company and drinking.

23
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:15,090
He had begged Miss Pinkerton to take on Becky
as an 'articled pupil' at the school before

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,630
he died.

25
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,069
Becky Sharp was a good-looking, intelligent
girl.

26
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,899
She was small and slender, and she had sandy
hair.

27
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,840
Miss Pinkerton had realised how useful she
could be because she knew French and could

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,499
play music.

29
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:34,759
Becky Sharp despised Miss Pinkerton and the
moral atmosphere of the academy.

30
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,780
The relationship between Miss Pinkerton and
Becky Sharp grew worse and worse.

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,789
Both of them were glad when the girl obtained
a post as governess to Sir Pitt Crawley.

32
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:48,240
Amelia Sedley was the daughter of a rich London
stockbroker.

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,470
She was a pretty girl, and she had healthy
red cheeks and a warm smile.

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,640
Everyone loved her because she was patient
and kind.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,100
Amelia had asked Becky to stay at her family's
house for a week when they left school.

36
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,410
Soon the two girls had said goodbye to the
headmistress, and they went out to the carriage.

37
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,910
Just as the carriage began to move, Miss Jemima
ran up to the window.

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,080
'Stop!'

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,350
she cried out excitedly.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,480
She pushed two parcels through the window.

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,520
'Some sandwiches, my dears,' she told the
two girls.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,200
'And a book for you, Becky,' she went on.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,240
'Johnson's Dictionary, you know.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,790
You can't leave without that.'

45
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,520
The good woman went back into the garden.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,450
She had defied her sister for once, but she
was sure she had done the right thing.

47
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,420
The carriage drove off.

48
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,980
Miss Jemima was horrified to see Becky Sharp
lean out of the window and throw the precious

49
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,020
dictionary back into the garden.

50
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,100
Mr and Mrs Sedley were delighted to have their
daughter back home, and they gave a kind welcome

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,510
to her friend Becky as well.

52
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,560
Amelia's older brother, Jos, was also at home.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,620
He had recently returned on leave from India,
where he had an important and lucrative post

54
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,200
in the East India Company's Civil Service.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,300
Jos Sedley had lived a very isolated life
in India, and he was terribly shy of women.

56
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,550
He was also extremely vain, and dressed in
the latest fashion.

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,890
This made him look rather ridiculous, as he
was very overweight.

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,090
It did not take long for Becky Sharp to understand
Jos, and a certain idea began to take shape

59
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,570
in her mind.

60
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,000
She hated the prospect of working as a governess.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,770
That night at dinner Becky Sharp paid particular
attention to Jos.

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,280
He was flattered by the looks she gave him,
and blushed frequently.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,330
Mrs Sedley had had a curry prepared for her
son, and Becky was offered some.

64
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,500
'I must try some,' she said.

65
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,420
'I'm sure it's very good if it comes from
India.'

66
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,330
Old Mr Sedley smiled quietly.

67
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,320
He understood her sudden enthusiasm for India
and curry.

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,560
'Is it good?' he asked her softly.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
'Excellent!'

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Becky gasped.

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,060
'Try a chilli with it,' Jos suggested.

72
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,200
'A chilli?'

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,020
Becky said faintly.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,620
The word 'chilli' sounded so cool that she
took a whole one.

75
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,570
It was hotter than the curry.

76
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,080
In a moment she was red in the face - she
could hardly breathe.

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
'Water!'

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
she cried.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,900
'Water, for heaven's sake!'

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,040
Mr Sedley laughed aloud.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,290
Even Jos laughed.

82
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,290
Becky was furious, but she took the joke in
good spirits.

83
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,830
Mr Sedley took his son aside after dinner,
and gave him a little advice.

84
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,290
'That girl's determined to marry you,' he
said.

85
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,290
'Nonsense!'

86
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,960
Jos replied, but he was very flattered.

87
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,370
Jos began to think about Becky more and more.

88
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,340
Soon he was convinced that he was in love
with her.

89
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,880
His behaviour towards her became stranger
and stranger as he struggled against his shyness.

90
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,850
Becky thought he was in love.

91
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,900
Perhaps he might ask her to marry him.

92
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,710
The future looked bright for her.

93
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,590
There were two other frequent visitors to
the Sedley household during Becky Sharp's

94
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,250
stay there.

95
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,430
They were two young army officers, William
Dobbin and George Osborne.

96
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,840
One evening all the young people decided to
go to Vauxhall Gardens together.

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,540
Amelia was very excited because she was in
love with George Osborne.

98
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,550
He was a good-looking young man, and he was
Mr Sedley's godson.

99
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,889
William Dobbin and George had been to the
same school, and they were close friends.

100
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:42,180
Dobbin was not as good-looking as his friend
- he was tall and very shy.

101
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,340
George and Amelia had known each other since
they were children.

102
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,540
Their families expected them to marry.

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,780
Becky was sure that Jos wanted to ask her
to marry him.

104
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,160
She walked by his side, giving him every encouragement
she could.

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,810
Jos himself was sure that he wanted to ask
her to marry him, but he did not know how

106
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,860
to approach the issue.

107
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,060
At last the party decided to eat something
at the restaurant in the Vauxhall Gardens.

108
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,050
Jos ordered a magnificent meal and the best
champagne.

109
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,390
He ate and drank more than anyone else.

110
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,480
Then he ordered a bowl of punch.

111
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,840
It was the custom at Vauxhall to drink punch.

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,590
It was the punch that was responsible for
the whole of this story.

113
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,210
If Jos Sedley had not ordered it, and then
drunk most of it, he would have proposed to

114
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,980
Becky Sharp, and that would have been the
end of the story.

115
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,120
As it was, the more he drank, the more cheerful
he became.

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,570
He began to sing, and this made people laugh.

117
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,900
George Osborne was embarrassed.

118
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,639
'I think we should leave,' he told the girls.

119
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,780
They stood up to go.

120
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,490
'Stop, my dearest diddle-diddle-darling!'

121
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,070
Jos cried out to Becky.

122
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,120
He seized hold of her waist.

123
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,260
Becky could not free herself, and Jos held
on to her tightly and resumed his song.

124
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,550
Dobbin succeeded in freeing the unfortunate
Becky.

125
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,490
He took Jos back to his lodgings, and George
Osborne took the girls back home.

126
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,260
Becky and Amelia were sure that the moment
had come for Jos to propose to Becky, after

127
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,740
his behaviour the night before!

128
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,210
Jos, meanwhile, woke with a terrible headache.

129
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,510
He did not remember everything that had happened
the night before, but he was terribly ashamed

130
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,949
of himself.

131
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,370
He did not have the courage to see Becky again.

132
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,199
He wrote a note to Amelia saying that he was
leaving London, and asking her to apologise

133
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,860
to Becky for his behaviour.

134
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,990
It was the end of Becky's hopes of marriage.

135
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,800
She knew now that she had to take up the post
of governess with Sir Pitt Crawley and his

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,780
family.

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,300
CHAPTER TWO
The Crawley Family

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,009
Becky's new employer was Sir Pitt Crawley.

139
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,889
Sir Pitt Crawley had been married twice, and
he had two grown-up sons from his first marriage

140
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,370
- Pitt and Rawdon Crawley.

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,919
After the death of his first wife Sir Pitt
had married again, this time choosing an ironmonger's

142
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:13,919
daughter.

143
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,600
They had two daughters.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,540
Sir Pitt had advertised for a governess to
help in the education of these two children.

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,130
Becky Sharp was young enough to have a romantic
idea of what a baronet's establishment might

146
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,199
be like.

147
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,070
She was very shocked, therefore, to discover
that Sir Pitt Crawley seemed hardly a gentleman

148
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,560
at all.

149
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,060
He was an elderly man who dressed badly and
drank too much.

150
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,450
He was also mean about money, and preferred
to spend his time eating and drinking with

151
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,680
the butler, rather than entertaining ladies
and gentlemen.

152
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,770
Sir Pitt Crawley's country residence, Queen's
Crawley, was a large house, but it was in

153
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,089
poor condition.

154
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,970
Becky soon realised that the most important
person in the house, after Sir Pitt Crawley

155
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,120
himself, was the baronet's older son, Pitt.

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,250
Unlike his father, he was rather a severe
man with very strong religious opinions.

157
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,900
It was clear that the father and son did not
get along well.

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,160
It was also clear that Sir Pitt's wife, the
ironmonger's daughter, wielded no power in

159
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,510
the house at all.

160
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,490
Lady Crawley had been a lovely young girl
before she married Sir Pitt Crawley.

161
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,070
She had given up a decent young man who loved
her for the happiness of becoming Lady Crawley.

162
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,300
Vanity Fair, indeed!

163
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,370
Her beauty faded, and Sir Pitt became bored
with her.

164
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,460
The poor woman was despised by all.

165
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,210
The only person who showed the slightest respect
for her was the baronet's older son, Pitt.

166
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:51,000
He behaved with a cold, formal correctness
to her at all times.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,980
Sir Pitt Crawley's brother, Bute, was the
local parson.

168
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,310
He and his family lived in the village rectory.

169
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,450
The relationship between the two brothers
was not particularly good.

170
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,430
They had quarrelled about money in the past,
and they continued to plot against each other.

171
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:14,130
Their plots centred around Sir Pitt's unmarried
half-sister, Miss Crawley.

172
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,120
Miss Crawley was a very rich, selfish old
woman.

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,550
She did not like Pitt Crawley because of his
piety.

174
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,550
She wanted to leave half of her money to Bute
Crawley, and the other half to Sir Pitt's

175
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,890
second son, Rawdon.

176
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,270
Becky rapidly decided on the most useful strategy
to follow at Queen's Crawley.

177
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,120
She wanted to keep everyone happy with least
effort to herself.

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,950
She won over the two daughters by letting
them educate themselves rather than giving

179
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,370
them difficult lessons to follow.

180
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,410
Sir Pitt Crawley was involved in a large number
of lawsuits with different people, and Becky

181
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,450
soon learned all the details of these.

182
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,190
She ordered his papers for him, and helped
prepare his accounts.

183
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,390
She also helped him with the management of
the estate, and was very useful in every way.

184
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,310
With his older son, Pitt, Becky took a different
approach.

185
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,050
She listened to his religious opinions very
seriously, and encouraged his political ambitions

186
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,800
as well.

187
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,000
The wealthy Miss Crawley soon arrived at Queen's
Crawley, where everyone made a great fuss

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,399
of her.

189
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,490
Becky wrote to Amelia, describing how Sir
Pitt provided the finest food and wines for

190
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,459
her, and how the family at the rectory also
did their best to entertain the selfish old

191
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,050
lady.

192
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,740
Sir Pitt's younger son,

193
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,770
Rawdon Crawley, also came to stay at Queen's
Crawley to be near his aunt.

194
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,290
Becky told Amelia that the young army officer
was very good-looking and had even asked her

195
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,310
to dance with him at a country ball.

196
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,339
Miss Crawley knew perfectly well that her
relatives were waiting for her to die so that

197
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,090
they could inherit her fortune.

198
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,170
She was a shallow, pleasure-loving woman,
and she only had time for the dashing young

199
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,190
army officer, Rawdon Crawley.

200
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,459
She regarded Pitt Crawley as a bore, and was
frightened of his religion and morality.

201
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,000
She thought Bute and his wife were dull as
well.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,540
It was not long before Becky Sharp had become
a favourite with the old lady.

203
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,200
Becky amused her by imitating the guests who
were invited to dine at Queen's Crawley.

204
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,050
Miss Crawley insisted that the governess sit
beside her and Rawdon at dinner.

205
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,610
'I don't care about birth and social position,'
she said to Becky.

206
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,670
'Look at my brother Pitt, look at Bute at
the parsonage.

207
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,940
None of them have got your intelligence, my
dear.

208
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,640
They're not even the equals of my poor old
companion Briggs.

209
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,580
No, what I care for is wit and breeding - and
you've got both!'

210
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,300
She even confided in Becky about her hopes
for Rawdon.

211
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,700
'I admired Nelson because he didn't care what
people thought.

212
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,420
He ran away with a beautiful woman.

213
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,910
I hope some great man runs away with you,
my dear!'

214
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,050
she went on.

215
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,270
'I hope Rawdon runs away with a girl,' she
added dreamily.

216
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,020
'A rich one or a poor one?'

217
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,080
Becky asked.

218
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,890
'A rich one, of course,' Miss Crawley replied
with a smile.

219
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:25,080
'Poor Rawdon hasn't got any money except what
I give him.'

220
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,410
'Is he terribly clever?'

221
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,350
Becky asked.

222
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,930
'Clever!'

223
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,010
the old lady laughed.

224
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,920
'Rawdon hasn't got an idea in his head.

225
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,810
But I want him to succeed - he's so delightfully
wicked!'

226
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,459
Although Becky told Amelia in her letter that
Rawdon had danced with her, she did not tell

227
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,329
her friend everything about the young army
officer's behaviour towards her.

228
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:56,230
One evening, when Becky was playing the piano,
Rawdon stood close to her, bending over the

229
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,230
music.

230
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,860
He had even written her a note while she was
singing after dinner once, and hidden it in

231
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,060
her music book.

232
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,520
Becky picked up the note and dropped it into
the fire.

233
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,339
'What's that, my dear?'

234
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,230
Miss Crawley asked sleepily.

235
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,250
'A false note,' Becky replied with a little
smile.

236
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:25,519
Rawdon blushed furiously.

237
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,019
CHAPTER THREE
Young Lovers

238
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,950
He must now leave the good people enjoying
themselves at Queen's Crawley, and return

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,230
to London to find out what is happening to
Amelia.

240
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,579
The ladies in Amelia's social circle agreed
that she was very good-natured but dull.

241
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:50,080
The Misses Osbornes and Dobbins patronised
the poor girl terribly, and Amelia was very

242
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,510
shy in their company.

243
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,399
'What does George see in her?'

244
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,899
they asked each other in wonder.

245
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,330
George Osborne himself became used to the
idea that he was making an enormous sacrifice

246
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,170
in marrying Amelia.

247
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,560
He continued to visit the Sedley household,
of course, but days went by when he ignored

248
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Amelia.

249
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,500
She suffered, but she told no one about her
suffering.

250
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,230
Only George's friend Dobbin realised that
the girl was unhappy.

251
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,360
Meanwhile great events were taking place in
Europe.

252
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,040
Napoleon's army was defeated by the allies,
and the emperor was forced to abdicate and

253
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,570
take up residence on the island of Elba.

254
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,900
The financial markets of the world were disturbed.

255
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,020
Mr Sedley suffered heavy losses in his investments
on the stock exchange.

256
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,200
One day George Osborne visited Amelia, and
invited her to dine with his family at Russell

257
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,790
Square that evening.

258
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,610
Amelia was delighted, and accepted happily.

259
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,660
Amelia arrived early at the house, and was
talking with George's sisters when Mr Osborne

260
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,529
came home.

261
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,560
Mr Osborne seemed surprised to see her there.

262
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,800
'George is home today, Papa,' one of the sisters
explained.

263
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,840
'He'll be coming in to dinner soon.'

264
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,790
'Will he indeed?'

265
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,120
Mr Osborne said crossly.

266
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,550
'He'd better come in on time.

267
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,240
I won't hold dinner for him.'

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,850
Mr Osborne sat down gloomily.

269
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,640
When the clock struck the usual time for dinner,
he rang for the butler.

270
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,540
'Dinner!' he ordered angrily.

271
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,070
'Mr George isn't in yet,' the man replied.

272
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,269
'Damn Mr George, sir.

273
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,470
I'm the master here!'

274
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,760
Mr Osborne commented angrily.

275
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,660
'Dinner, I say!'

276
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,350
The ladies looked at each other in fright.

277
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,520
Dinner was a silent affair.

278
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,870
Mr Osborne said nothing, and no one else knew
how to make conversation.

279
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,779
George arrived halfway through the meal, and
did not seem to notice his father's bad humour.

280
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,450
He talked amusingly to Amelia and his sisters.

281
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,269
At last the ladies retired to the drawing
room, leaving Mr Osborne and George to their

282
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,320
wine.

283
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,339
The older man was still bad-tempered.

284
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,660
George did his best to cheer him up.

285
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,380
The real reason for his visit was that he
had run out of money.

286
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,140
He was hoping for some money from his father.

287
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,990
At last his father spoke.

288
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,179
'How are you and Amelia getting on?' he asked.

289
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:21,010
'Anyone can see that she loves me, sir,' George
replied proudly.

290
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,429
'And you?'

291
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:26,210
his father asked sharply, 'What about you,
my boy?'

292
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,350
George laughed easily.

293
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,070
'Didn't you tell me to marry Amelia, sir?'
he joked.

294
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,780
'You and Mr Sedley arranged it all years ago!'

295
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,870
'Hmm,' commented his father.

296
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,020
'Haven't I heard about you and your wild amusements
with Captain Crawley and that set?

297
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,370
You should be careful, sir.'

298
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:49,520
Mr Osborne was secretly delighted that his
son was mixing in such aristocratic company.

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,790
He was very ambitious for George.

300
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,740
'Well, well,' he went on.

301
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,870
'I suppose young men will be young men.

302
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,590
I'm glad you live in the best society of England.'

303
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,400
'One can't live in that kind of society for
nothing, you know,' George said quietly.

304
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,160
'Don't worry about money, my boy,' Mr Osborne
interrupted him.

305
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,700
'My money's as good as theirs.

306
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,490
Call on Mr Chopper in the City tomorrow - he'll
have something for you.'

307
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,110
'Thank you, sir.'

308
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,260
'You could marry higher than Amelia, you know,'
Mr Osborne told him.

309
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,250
'I don't like the look of Sedley's affairs.

310
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,120
There are rumours about his losses.

311
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,900
If I don't see Amelia's ten thousand pounds
you won't marry her.

312
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,290
I won't have any lame ducks in my family.'

313
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,870
George was very attentive to Amelia when he
went to join the ladies after his talk with

314
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,410
his father.

315
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,840
She remembered long afterwards the pleasure
of that evening with him.

316
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,510
George hurried off to the City the next morning,
and obtained a document from Mr Chopper.

317
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,480
Then he hurried to the bank.

318
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,100
He noticed that Mr Sedley was also in the
bank, but he was too excited to notice the

319
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,800
grim look on the older man's face.

320
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,350
Meanwhile Miss Crawley had returned to London
from her visit to Queen's Crawley, bringing

321
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,720
Becky Sharp with her.

322
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,300
The old lady had eaten and drunk far too much,
and was feeling unwell.

323
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,020
She retired immediately to bed, and summoned
her doctor.

324
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,440
Captain Crawley was one of the first people
to arrive at her house to ask after her.

325
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,760
He received gloomy reports from the maid and
from Miss Briggs her companion.

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,309
Captain Crawley was unable to see the patient,
but he did manage to have a few minutes of

327
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,850
private conversation with Becky.

328
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,520
He left the house looking very cheerful.

329
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,900
Miss Briggs tried to gain admission to the
sick lady's bedroom, but was refused.

330
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,690
The poor lady had been a loyal and faithful
companion for many years and was wounded by

331
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,090
Miss Crawley's behaviour.

332
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,940
'But why won't she see me?'

333
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
she asked Becky.

334
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,299
'I always look after her when she's ill.'

335
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,110
'Don't be so upset,' Becky advised her.

336
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,420
'She won't see you because she prefers my
nursing to yours, that's all.

337
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,460
Sick people are like that sometimes.

338
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,010
She'll be well again in a few weeks, and then
I'll go back to Queen's Crawley.'

339
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,169
'Never, never,' Miss Briggs said sadly.

340
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,710
'She'll never be well, or I'll never go?'

341
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,100
Becky asked with a little smile.

342
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,880
Captain Crawley called every day to receive
the latest news from Becky.

343
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,660
Every day the news was better, and soon Miss
Crawley allowed the faithful Briggs to spend

344
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,140
time with her once more.

345
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,700
Becky used to mimic the good woman to her
face for the amusement of the old lady.

346
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,370
Once Miss Crawley was well again, she agreed
to accompany Becky to Russell Square so that

347
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,200
the girl could be reunited with her old school
friend, Amelia.

348
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,860
The visit was a short one, but Amelia made
a good impression on the rich old lady.

349
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,070
She talked enthusiastically about Becky's
friend, and mentioned her to Captain Crawley.

350
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,510
Becky was quick to explain that Amelia had
a fiance - a certain Lieutenant George Osborne.

351
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,640
'What regiment is he in?'

352
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Rawdon asked.

353
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,080
'I don't recall,' Becky replied, 'but his
Captain's name is Dobbin.'

354
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,340
'I know Dobbin,' Rawdon told her.

355
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,220
'And I know Osborne too, now that I think
of it.

356
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,300
Osborne's a fool,' he commented happily.

357
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,900
'He wants to be seen in the company of a lord.

358
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,930
He pays for their dinners, and they invite
the guests.'

359
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,530
'Pretty guests,' Becky suggested with a smile.

360
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,090
'Quite right, Miss Sharp,' Rawdon laughed.

361
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,669
'Very pretty guests indeed.'

362
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,020
'Don't be so naughty, Rawdon!'

363
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,720
the old lady laughed excitedly.

364
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,350
Her nephew's cynicism delighted her enormously.

365
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,410
'Why don't we have him here?'

366
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,410
Rawdon suggested.

367
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,670
Lieutenant Osborne and Amelia were invited
for dinner at Miss Crawley's house.

368
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:00,120
The meeting between Becky and George Osborne
was not an easy one.

369
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,870
Becky suspected that it was George who had
discouraged Jos Sedley from proposing to her

370
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,710
after the dinner at Vauxhall Gardens.

371
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,020
She greeted him very coolly.

372
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,740
For his part, Osborne thought her vain and
ambitious.

373
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,450
Amelia saw immediately that there was a friendship
between Becky and Rawdon.

374
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,020
Before leaving the house she went up to her
friend.

375
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,620
'I see it all,' she said quietly.

376
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,270
Becky kissed her.

377
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,200
One day Sir Pitt Crawley came to London.

378
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,789
His wife had just died, and the baronet was
desperate to have Becky back at the house.

379
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,980
'You must come,' he told her.

380
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,360
'I'll come as soon as I can,' Becky replied.

381
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
'Everything's in a mess without you,' Sir
Pitt complained.

382
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,380
'Dear Becky, do come!'

383
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,620
Becky looked at him closely.

384
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,840
'Come as what?'

385
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,490
she asked quietly.

386
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,770
'Come as Lady Crawley, if you like,' the old
man cried impatiently.

387
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,039
'Come back and be my wife.

388
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,039
There!

389
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,870
Does that satisfy you?'

390
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,490
'Oh Sir Pitt!'

391
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,690
Becky cried.

392
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,850
'Say yes,' Sir Pit begged her.

393
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,960
'I'm an old man, Becky, but I'll make you
happy, you see if I don't.'

394
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,600
The old man got down on his knees before her.

395
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
Becky jumped back.

396
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,900
For once she did not know what to say.

397
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,580
'Oh, Sir Pitt!'

398
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,760
she cried again.

399
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:33,510
'Oh - sir - I'm married already!'

400
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,679
CHAPTER FOUR
A Family Bankruptcy

401
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,740
Miss Briggs happened to be passing the room
where the interview between Becky and Sir

402
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,800
Pitt was taking place.

403
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,240
She heard both his offer of marriage, and
Becky's refusal of it.

404
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,580
She did not stay long enough, however, to
hear the reason for the refusal - that Becky

405
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,870
was already married.

406
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,730
Miss Briggs carried the exciting news to Miss
Crawley.

407
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:05,480
Miss Crawley was impressed that Becky had
refused the baronet, and secretly relieved.

408
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,270
She talked the matter over with Briggs, and
the two women agreed that Becky must be in

409
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,059
love with someone else.

410
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,909
'Find out who it is,' Miss Crawley ordered
her companion.

411
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,970
Becky admitted to Miss Briggs that she was
in love with someone else, but she refused

412
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,350
to tell Briggs who the man was.

413
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,020
She did not tell Miss Crawley either when
the old lady interrogated her.

414
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,309
'You will know soon enough, my dear,' she
said.

415
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,979
That evening, when she was alone in her bedroom,
she wrote a letter.

416
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:37,979
 

417
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:38,979
Dear friend,

418
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:43,220
Half of our secret is known, and I'm sure
that the time has come to tell everything.

419
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,040
It's risky, I know, but I'm sure we'll win
in the end.

420
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,900
Miss Crawley is very sympathetic and generous.

421
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,450
I think everything will be all right!

422
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,230
She addressed the letter to 'Miss Elizabeth
Styles'.

423
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,100
The reader will not perhaps be surprised that
Miss Elizabeth Styles, who wore a military

424
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,890
uniform, was none other than Captain Rawdon
Crawley.

425
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,260
The next morning Becky's bedroom was empty.

426
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,520
She had left a note for Briggs, explaining
the mystery of her marriage and asking her

427
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,360
to break the news to Miss Crawley.

428
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,809
It was bad luck for Becky that Mrs Bute Crawley
arrived at the house that morning.

429
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,919
Briggs told her the whole story, and they
went to Miss Crawley together.

430
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,289
The old lady was horrified at the news, and
had another attack of illness.

431
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:36,640
'I'll never forgive them!'

432
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,200
she said.

433
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:45,950
'And I'll never give Rawdon another penny
of my money.'

434
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,930
Sir Pitt also came to the house that morning.

435
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,090
He wanted to see Becky.

436
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:56,460
'She's got to come back to Queen's Crawley
with me,' he told Briggs.

437
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,540
'I can't manage without her.'

438
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,640
'But don't you know she's married?'

439
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,120
Briggs replied in astonishment.

440
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,410
'What do I care about that?'

441
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,909
the baronet said angrily.

442
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:08,169
'I know she's married.'

443
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,620
'She left the house this morning, sir,' Briggs
explained.

444
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,039
'Miss Crawley is very upset by the news of
her marriage to Captain Rawdon.'

445
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,660
When Sir Pitt heard that Becky was married
to his own son, he broke into a furious rage.

446
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,530
Then he left the house very noisily.

447
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,530
'But what if she doesn't forgive me?'

448
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,530
Rawdon asked his wife that night, as they
sat together in their modest little apartment.

449
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,270
'Don't worry about that,' Becky said sweetly.

450
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,120
'I'll make your fortune for you.'

451
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,230
'You can do anything,' he replied tenderly.

452
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,620
There is one event in Vanity Fair that attracts
both sentiment and satire, and that is the

453
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,630
auction of a bankrupt person's household goods.

454
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,821
People who attend these auctions remember
how things were different in the past, how

455
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:06,210
the person who is penniless now, used to offer
his guests the finest wines and food.

456
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,340
An auction was taking place at the Sedley
household.

457
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,610
Old Sedley was now a ruined man.

458
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,640
Captain Dobbin was at the auction.

459
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
He was very interested in a little piano that
had belonged to Amelia.

460
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,840
His agent began to bid for the instrument,
as did Becky's agent on her behalf.

461
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,730
The bidding was fast, and the price rose high.

462
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:36,520
At last Becky's agent ceased to bid, and the
piano became the property of Captain Dobbin.

463
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,690
The piano arrived that evening at a modest
little house off the Fulham Road, where the

464
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,090
Sedleys were now living.

465
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:48,770
'He was a kind man, Mr Sedley,' Becky commented
dreamily to Rawdon.

466
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,740
She was remembering her stay at the house.

467
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,500
'I'm sorry it's all gone wrong for him.'

468
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,980
'Oh, these stockbrokers,' Rawdon said carelessly,
'they're used to this sort of thing, you know.

469
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,140
I'm sorry for your little friend Amelia, though.

470
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,440
I suppose young Osborne will think twice before
he marries her now!'

471
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,190
Rawdon's guess was not far wrong.

472
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,720
Amelia had received a letter from George Osborne's
father immediately the news of the bankruptcy

473
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,110
became public knowledge.

474
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:22,600
Mr Osborne told her that her father had behaved
very badly, and that it was no longer possible

475
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,870
for the two families to know each other.

476
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,780
She showed the letter to her father, who was
very angry.

477
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,870
He ordered her to return every letter and
present that she had received from George,

478
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,940
and to forget about him.

479
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,860
Amelia sent back the few presents that George
had given her, but she kept his letters.

480
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,190
They were her most precious possessions.

481
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,760
There was more exciting news from Europe.

482
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,630
Napoleon had escaped from Elba and returned
to France.

483
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,960
Everyone knew that war was coming.

484
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,679
One day Dobbin found his friend George Osborne
in his room at the barracks.

485
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
He looked very upset.

486
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,659
'She's sent me back all the presents I gave
her,' George told his friend.

487
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,430
'It's all over.

488
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,070
Look, read this.'

489
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,700
He passed Dobbin a letter from Amelia.

490
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,260
Dobbin had visited Mr Sedley and the family
in their new house off the Fulham Road.

491
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,309
He knew that Amelia was very ill.

492
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:26,120
'She's dying, George,' he said quietly.

493
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,080
A few hours later George Osborne paid a visit
to the Sedley household.

494
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,059
Mrs Bute Crawley established herself at Miss
Crawley's house in London to nurse the old

495
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,169
lady.

496
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:42,510
She made sure that letters from Rawdon Crawley
were intercepted.

497
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:48,110
She read Miss Crawley religious stories, and
encouraged her to consider serious matters.

498
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,690
It was her hope that Miss Crawley was planning
to write a new will, leaving some of her money

499
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,460
to Bute Crawley.

500
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,680
Mrs Bute Crawley was very successful in her
arrangements.

501
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,080
Perhaps she was too successful.

502
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,520
She frightened and depressed Miss Crawley
instead of amusing her.

503
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,980
Even her doctors thought that the effect of
Mrs Bute Crawley's influence was dangerous.

504
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,789
One of them tried to talk to her.

505
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:17,320
'You have done a lot for our poor patient,'
he told her.

506
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,650
'But she is not as ill as she was.

507
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,730
Indeed, she needs fresh air now.

508
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,610
If you keep her in the house, she may really
die!'

509
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,300
At last an expedition to the park was organised.

510
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,320
Miss Crawley's carriage was soon spotted by
Becky and Rawdon, who were also out driving.

511
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,730
Rawdon drove past his aunt, and saluted her
gravely.

512
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,590
His aunt ignored him.

513
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,550
'That's it, then,' he commented to Becky.

514
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:49,700
'She won't acknowledge me.'

515
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:56,120
CHAPTER FIVE
A Wedding and a Disinheritance

516
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,049
Captain Dobbin now found himself in a very
painful and difficult position.

517
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:06,070
He could see that George was less and less
keen to marry Amelia, and he realised that

518
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,360
he himself was falling in love with her.

519
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,010
'She will die if George does not marry her,'
he thought.

520
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,790
He determined to make sure that the wedding
went ahead.

521
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,970
George and his father, meanwhile, had quarrelled
bitterly.

522
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,590
Mr Osborne wanted his son to marry a rich
girl.

523
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,710
George, however, who had been influenced by
Dobbin's account of Amelia's sufferings, promised

524
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,620
to be true to his word.

525
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,220
'I'll have no beggars in my family, sir!'

526
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,470
his father roared.

527
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:40,320
'Marry Amelia and you leave this house for
ever - you leave it a penniless man, I tell

528
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
you!'

529
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,399
'I've done it, Dobbin,' George told his friend
afterwards.

530
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,799
'Done what?'

531
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,799
Dobbin asked.

532
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,990
'I've told my father,' George informed him.

533
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:53,150
'I'll marry her tomorrow - I love her more
and more each day!'

534
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,110
One morning a quiet wedding took place in
London.

535
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,940
Amelia was the bride and George the bridegroom.

536
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,090
The best man was the faithful Dobbin.

537
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,490
Jos Sedley was also in attendance, as was
Mrs Sedley.

538
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,159
Mr Sedley did not attend the ceremony.

539
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,460
George and Amelia went to Brighton for their
honeymoon.

540
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,380
They were accompanied by Jos Sedley.

541
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,590
Here they met up with Captain Crawley and
his wife.

542
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:25,299
Jos was now wearing military-style clothing
in honour of the coming war, and George and

543
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,840
Captain Crawley teased him about it.

544
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,720
The two couples spent most of their time together.

545
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,830
The gentlemen had their own amusements after
dinner.

546
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,830
They usually played billiards or cards, and
this allowed Captain Crawley to acquire some

547
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,700
much-needed ready money.

548
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,669
One day Dobbin came down to Brighton to see
his friends.

549
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:50,570
He greeted them in a friendly way, but his
face was serious.

550
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,409
'What's the news?'

551
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:53,409
George asked eagerly.

552
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:54,890
'What does my father say?'

553
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,840
'I'll tell you everything later,' Dobbin said
quietly.

554
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,640
'The really important thing is - '

555
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,280
'Come on, tell us!'

556
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,340
George cried excitedly.

557
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,740
'The campaign's started.

558
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,540
We're going to Belgium, old boy.

559
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
O'Dowd's in command.

560
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,180
We leave next week.'

561
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,890
It was true that Dobbin had been to see Mr
Osborne, to break the news of his son's marriage

562
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,419
to Amelia.

563
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,850
The interview had not been a success.

564
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,930
Mr Osborne was furious at his son's disobedience,
and furious with poor Dobbin as well for having

565
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,230
encouraged the match.

566
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:31,210
When he returned home that evening, Mr Osborne
sat for many hours in his study.

567
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,260
He adored his son, but he was a very proud
man, and George's marriage had disappointed

568
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,590
him bitterly.

569
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,149
Mr Osborne took down the family Bible, where
the names of all his children were inscribed.

570
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:46,860
He eliminated George's name.

571
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,809
Then he wrote a letter to the bank, instructing
the cashier not to pay further funds to his

572
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,539
son.

573
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:57,679
Another visitor who was staying at Brighton
was Miss Crawley.

574
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,549
Becky made Rawdon write the old lady a note.

575
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:04,919
Then Becky took the note to Briggs and begged
her to deliver it.

576
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,240
Miss Crawley laughed when she read it.

577
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,299
'Don't you see,' she cried, 'Rawdon never
wrote a word of it!

578
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:21,769
His letters are always about money, and they're
full of spelling mistakes and bad grammar.

579
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:28,769
It's that little governess of his who told
him what to say!'

580
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:32,319
In her heart she felt sad and bitter.

581
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:37,399
She knew that everyone wanted her dead; they
wanted her money.

582
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:45,771
'You may tell Captain Crawley,' she informed
Briggs, 'that he can call on my lawyer in

583
00:34:45,771 --> 00:34:46,771
London.

584
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:52,210
There will be something for him there.'

585
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,359
Rawdon and Becky were delighted at the news
from Miss Crawley.

586
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:59,490
They hurried as fast as they could to London.

587
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,209
Rawdon then made his way to the lawyer's office.

588
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,959
He looked gloomy when he joined Becky.

589
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:07,249
'It's a rotten trick, Becky,' he told her.

590
00:35:07,249 --> 00:35:10,969
'The old lady's only given me twenty pounds!'

591
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:14,239
The joke was too good for Becky to resist.

592
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:24,650
She looked at Rawdon's serious face, and burst
out laughing.

593
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:30,089
CHAPTER SIX
Preparations for War

594
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:34,779
The Osbornes and Dobbin now made their way
to Chatham, from where the regiment was to

595
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,489
embark for Europe.

596
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:42,259
Amelia was presented to Peggy O'Dowd, the
commanding officer's wife.

597
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:47,309
Peggy O'Dowd was a friendly Irishwoman, and
she made Amelia very welcome.

598
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,630
'We're all good friends here,' she explained
cheerfully.

599
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,089
'There isn't a happier regiment in the whole
army.'

600
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:58,979
Jos had agreed to accompany Amelia to Europe,
and everyone noticed that his appearance became

601
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,979
more and more military every day.

602
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:05,990
At last they arrived in Brussels where the
regiment was quartered.

603
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:11,069
Everyone was delighted with the city, and
all the Vanity Fair booths were laid out before

604
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,839
them with their usual attractions.

605
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,900
There was gambling for those who liked it,
there was a theatre, and above all, there

606
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,589
was a huge throng of lords, ladies and gentlemen.

607
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:26,239
George was enthusiastic about the social life
of Brussels.

608
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,079
One evening he danced with one of Lady Bareacre's
daughters.

609
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,609
He even invited the Bareacres to a grand dinner.

610
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:38,859
They accepted the invitation, but they refused
to speak to poor Amelia, whom they considered

611
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:41,240
their social inferior.

612
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,829
She passed a very miserable evening in their
company.

613
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,700
One day Captain Crawley and Becky arrived
in the city.

614
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,549
They were travelling with General Tufto, and
they mixed in the very highest military circles.

615
00:36:54,549 --> 00:37:00,519
George was quite proud to know the Crawleys,
and to be seen around the city with them.

616
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,089
Becky was in the very best of humours.

617
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:08,670
She teased poor Jos about their old romance,
and she flirted with George.

618
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,859
Amelia was uncomfortable in her presence.

619
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:15,380
She felt that Becky's influence on her husband
was not a good one.

620
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,999
Dobbin was more forthright still.

621
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:21,059
'What a humbug that woman is!' he commented
to George.

622
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:26,400
A grand ball was planned, and everyone was
desperate to have a ticket to the social event

623
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,880
of the year.

624
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,049
Jos and Mrs O'Dowd were unlucky, but the Bareacres
obtained tickets for Captain Osborne and his

625
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,809
wife.

626
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,259
Dobbin was given a ticket by a general he
knew.

627
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:42,260
George bought new clothes for Amelia, and
drove her to the ball.

628
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,740
She did not know anyone there, and sat by
herself while her husband went off to look

629
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,249
for his friends.

630
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:54,650
Amelia was unhappy, and the only person who
came to talk to her was honest Dobbin.

631
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,219
Becky, meanwhile, had made a splendid entrance.

632
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,719
She immediately joined the most select group
of people at the ball, and was soon the centre

633
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,269
of attention with the men there.

634
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:12,190
She spoke French perfectly, and everyone wanted
to dance with her.

635
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,780
Then she spotted Amelia, and came over to
join her on the bench.

636
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,880
She criticised her clothes, commented happily
on the ball, and then gave her friend a lot

637
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,539
of advice that humiliated poor Amelia even
more.

638
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:31,499
When George saw that Becky had joined his
wife, he too hurried over to the bench.

639
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,569
He asked Becky to dance, and she agreed.

640
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,539
They danced together two or three times.

641
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,130
Amelia was very unhappy.

642
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,450
Tears came into her eyes.

643
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:46,749
Then George ran back to collect Becky's shawl
and flowers.

644
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:48,579
Becky was leaving the ball.

645
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:52,270
George carried her bouquet to her, but when
he gave it to her she saw that there was a

646
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,969
note lying among the flowers.

647
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,619
Becky had received many such notes in her
life.

648
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,989
She smiled at George, and turned towards her
husband.

649
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:05,210
Amelia was watching the scene between George
and Becky.

650
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,869
She turned very pale.

651
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:11,299
'William,' she said quietly, 'I don't feel
very well.

652
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,529
Please take me home.'

653
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,660
Dobbin escorted her away from the ball.

654
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,299
George, meanwhile, was in a very elated mood.

655
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:21,990
He did not notice that his wife had left the
ball.

656
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,140
He gambled at the tables, winning repeatedly.

657
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,670
Then he began drinking heavily.

658
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,960
Dobbin found him in a very excitable mood
when he returned from Amelia's hotel.

659
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,019
'Come out, George,' Dobbin said quietly.

660
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:36,019
'Nonsense!'

661
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,019
George cried.

662
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:39,279
'Come and drink with me, my old friend!'

663
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,489
Dobbin came close to him.

664
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:42,779
'The enemy is advancing,' he whispered.

665
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:44,920
'We're leaving in three hours.'

666
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,539
There was little sleep for anyone that night.

667
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:53,499
Everyone was busy preparing for the sudden
departure for the battlefield.

668
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:58,170
George made his way quickly to the hotel,
where Amelia was already in bed.

669
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,519
He thought about the short weeks of his marriage
and blushed with shame when he thought about

670
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:04,650
the note he had given to Becky Sharp.

671
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,989
'What will happen to Amelia if I die?' he
asked himself.

672
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:14,539
He wrote a letter to his father, asking him
to look after his wife if he was killed, and

673
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,589
thanking him for his past kindness.

674
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:21,940
He was very kind to her the next morning before
he went away.

675
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,789
Amelia was very upset to see him go.

676
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:30,289
The O'Dowds were also making their preparations
for the departure.

677
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:34,209
'Call me at half-past one, my dear,' the Major
said quietly to his wife.

678
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,630
'And have my things ready for me.'

679
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,510
This was his way of indicating that the regiment
was marching the next morning.

680
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,779
Rawdon spent the last hours with Becky reckoning
up what he could leave behind for Becky if

681
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,420
anything happened to him.

682
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,680
'Look,' he said, 'I've been lucky recently
at cards - here's two hundred and fifty pounds

683
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
in cash.

684
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,779
Then there are my horses.'

685
00:40:55,779 --> 00:41:00,769
Captain Crawley, who cheated his friends at
cards, and who never paid his debts, had tears

686
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:05,479
in his eyes when he lifted Becky up to kiss
her goodbye.

687
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:10,769
Becky had wisely decided not to give in to
her emotions.

688
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,219
Captain Dobbin called on Jos very early in
the morning.

689
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:18,890
Jos was not pleased to be woken up and he
greeted Dobbin without enthusiasm.

690
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,299
'What can I do for you?' he enquired coldly.

691
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:26,480
'George and I are marching in an hour,' Dobbin
explained.

692
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,910
'I want you to look after your sister.

693
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,209
If something happens to the army, take her
back to England.

694
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:34,980
You're the only person she's got!'

695
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:44,400
Soon after they all marched out of the city.

696
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,759
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Battle of Waterloo

697
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:54,900
There was great excitement in Brussels after
the British army had marched out to meet Napoleon's

698
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
troops.

699
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,390
Jos, meanwhile, was surprised to receive a
visit from Becky Sharp that morning.

700
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:05,279
He had not been invited to any of the grand
social events in which she had played such

701
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:09,219
a brilliant part, and he was offended at her
neglect.

702
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:14,880
Becky, who was not sure of a British victory,
decided to become friends with her old admirer

703
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
again.

704
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,809
'I'm sure you're getting ready to join the
army,' she told him.

705
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:23,499
'Soon there'll be nobody left in Brussels
to protect us poor women!'

706
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,289
Jos was delighted at the idea that she thought
he was joining the army.

707
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:32,979
'I should like to see the battle,' he replied
grandly, 'but I have my sister to protect.'

708
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:35,900
'What a good brother you are!'

709
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,279
Becky exclaimed.

710
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,249
She put her handkerchief to her eyes.

711
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:45,089
'Your heart is true to your sister,' she went
on, 'but I remember a time when it was false

712
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,930
to me!'

713
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,390
Jos blushed furiously.

714
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,130
He did not know what to say to her.

715
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,309
'I've avoided you here in Brussels,' Becky
went on.

716
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:55,339
'What else could I do?

717
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,789
Do you think my husband could bear to speak
to you?

718
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,719
You're the only man he's ever been jealous
of, you know!'

719
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:04,949
Poor Jos was delighted at this speech.

720
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:08,569
He forgot his doubts and suspicions of Becky.

721
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,170
Becky observed him closely.

722
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:16,799
'At least he'll give me a place in his carriage
if the army is defeated,' she thought.

723
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:20,029
Becky then went into Amelia's room to greet
her.

724
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:23,920
She found her ill because she was worried
about George.

725
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,109
Amelia regarded her as an enemy now, and the
interview was a painful one for the two women.

726
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,819
'You tried to do me wrong,' Amelia complained.

727
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,180
'You tried to take my husband from me, Rebecca.

728
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,959
But he came back to me, you see - he came
back to me!'

729
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,849
She burst into tears.

730
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:44,869
Becky left Amelia's room.

731
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:46,630
For once she was silent.

732
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,289
Her friend's tears had moved her.

733
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:54,479
She happened to encounter Mrs Peggy O'Dowd
in the street outside, and she told her that

734
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:56,779
Amelia was very upset.

735
00:43:56,779 --> 00:44:00,180
The good lady hurried to the house.

736
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,640
Brussels was full of rumours about the great
battle.

737
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,900
Jos grew increasingly nervous.

738
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,559
He was not a brave man, and what he heard
from his servants frightened him.

739
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,140
He began to think about leaving the city.

740
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,229
He told Amelia that he thought it was best
to prepare to leave, but she refused to listen

741
00:44:17,229 --> 00:44:18,650
to him.

742
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,839
That night Jos's fears increased to panic.

743
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:27,569
Some Belgian soldiers had retreated into the
city, and one of these took refuge with the

744
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,640
maid in Jos's house.

745
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,479
The young soldier was tired and hungry, and
he told terrible stories about the defeat

746
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:35,589
of the British army.

747
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:40,199
'The Duke of Wellington is a prisoner,' he
insisted, 'and the whole army is in flight.

748
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,170
Napoleon has won.'

749
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,859
Jos had come into the kitchen to hear the
soldier's account, and he was now wild with

750
00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:46,960
terror.

751
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,380
He changed out of his military-style clothes
as quickly as he could, and ordered his servant

752
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,680
to prepare the carriage.

753
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,249
'There are no horses left in Brussels, sir,'
the servant told him.

754
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:00,140
Jos dashed into the street.

755
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,849
He ran to all the hotels in a desperate search
for horses.

756
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:07,410
In one hotel he saw Lady Bareacres and her
daughters sitting in a carriage.

757
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,180
They, too, were waiting for horses.

758
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,960
Lady Bareacres was also desperate to abandon
the city.

759
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,849
This proud lady, who had refused to acknowledge
Becky when they passed on the stairs, now

760
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:22,619
came to ask her to sell Captain Crawley's
horses.

761
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,219
'I won't sell you my horses, my Lady,' Becky
told her proudly, 'not for the two largest

762
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:30,289
diamonds you wore at the ball.'

763
00:45:30,289 --> 00:45:34,670
Just then Becky caught sight of Jos entering
the hotel.

764
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,739
The frightened expression on his face told
her everything.

765
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,359
'He will buy my horses,' she decided.

766
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:46,089
Jos and Becky were soon in earnest conversation
together.

767
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:51,000
The price she asked for the horses was a huge
one, but Jos was so terrified that he agreed

768
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,160
to pay.

769
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,359
Jos now told his servant to prepare the horses.

770
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:59,910
He had decided to ride out of the city as
soon as he could.

771
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,640
He went back once more to Amelia to persuade
her to come with him.

772
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,420
'Emmy, I'm leaving today,' he told her, 'and
you must come with me.

773
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,869
There's no time to lose!'

774
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:14,049
'You're a coward, Mr Sedley,' Peggy O'Dowd
told him quietly.

775
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:15,170
'Never mind her!'

776
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,170
cried Jos.

777
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,009
'Are you coming with me or not, Emmy?'

778
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,769
Amelia was too ill to move.

779
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:22,069
'Without my husband, Jos?'

780
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:23,950
Amelia replied.

781
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,510
Jos saw that it was useless.

782
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,569
'Goodbye, then,' he said in a rage, and left
the room.

783
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:34,400
A few minutes later the two ladies saw him
riding awkwardly down the street on one of

784
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,130
Becky's horses, followed by his servant on
the other.

785
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,880
The noise of the great battle could be heard
throughout the city all that day.

786
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,229
At last the guns grew silent.

787
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:48,249
The English had their victory.

788
00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:50,219
Darkness fell.

789
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:55,229
Amelia was praying for her husband, who was
lying on his face, dead, with a bullet through

790
00:46:55,229 --> 00:47:01,849
his heart.

791
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:06,190
CHAPTER EIGHT
Miss Crawley

792
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,920
Miss Crawley was now living in Brighton, and
she read the news of the Battle of Waterloo

793
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,049
with great interest.

794
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:16,119
Rawdon had been promoted; he was now a Colonel.

795
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,739
'What a pity that fine young man behaved as
he did!' said the kind-hearted Briggs.

796
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,390
She wanted Miss Crawley to forgive Rawdon
and Becky.

797
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,619
'Rawdon's a fool,' the old lady replied angrily.

798
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,319
'He could have married well if he'd had my
money behind him.

799
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,880
But he won't get any of it now!'

800
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,039
Rawdon and Becky took good care to write regularly
to Miss Crawley, and the old lady was amused

801
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,349
by their letters, although she knew perfectly
well that it was Becky who wrote them and

802
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:46,819
not her nephew.

803
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:51,259
Miss Crawley's attitude to the family at the
rectory was not so warm.

804
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:55,259
She had been frightened by Mrs Bute Crawley
during her illness in London.

805
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:58,650
Worse than that, she had been bored by the
rector's wife.

806
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,989
Still, presents of farm produce arrived regularly
at Miss Crawley's house in Brighton, with

807
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:08,829
tender notes of affection from the family
at the rectory.

808
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,969
Rawdon's brother, Pitt, was also attentive
to his aunt.

809
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:17,150
He came frequently to Brighton to visit his
fiancee, Lady Jane Sheepshanks, who lived

810
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:24,799
in the town with her sisters and mother, the
formidable and religious-minded Countess Southdown.

811
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:29,549
Pitt hinted to Lady Southdown that it might
be beneficial for her family to make a friendship

812
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:30,799
with his aunt.

813
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:34,059
He told her that Miss Crawley was now all
alone in the world.

814
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:39,209
'I'll certainly visit the poor lady,' the
Countess responded enthusiastically.

815
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,489
'I'll leave her some religious literature
as well.'

816
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:45,619
'No, my dear lady,' said the artful Pitt.

817
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:51,189
'She has been seriously ill, and she has not
been accustomed to think of spiritual matters.

818
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:53,229
We must proceed slowly.

819
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:58,040
Besides,' he added quietly, 'we don't want
to frighten the poor lady.

820
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,670
She has seventy thousand pounds.

821
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,690
Think of that.'

822
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,829
Countess Southdown nodded her head in agreement.

823
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:09,420
The next day the Southdown carriage pulled
up outside Miss Crawley's house.

824
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,440
The visit was a great success, and Miss Crawley
took particularly to Pitt's fiancee Lady Jane.

825
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,430
Pitt was in high spirits, and spent his time
daydreaming about the old lady's seventy thousand

826
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:22,220
pounds.

827
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:27,219
News of the friendship between Pitt Crawley
and his aunt soon reached the rectory, and

828
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:32,599
Mrs Bute Crawley decided to make one further
effort to win the old lady's fortune for her

829
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:34,009
family.

830
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:38,579
She sent her son James to visit Miss Crawley.

831
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,210
James was a student.

832
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,420
He was a simple young fellow, more interested
in sport and beer than in his studies.

833
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,439
He was no match for Pitt Crawley.

834
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:52,799
The older man encouraged him to drink too
much wine, and led him on to entertain the

835
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:57,170
ladies with some exciting sporting stories.

836
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:01,069
James swayed drunkenly up the stairs to his
bedroom.

837
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,150
When he arrived there he opened the window
and lit his pipe.

838
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:08,329
He stared happily out at the sea, smoking
contentedly.

839
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:13,479
He had forgotten, however, to close the bedroom
door behind him - and the smell of pipe tobacco

840
00:50:13,479 --> 00:50:15,609
spread through the house.

841
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:18,759
The following morning he received a note from
Briggs.

842
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:20,269
Dear Sir,

843
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:24,770
Miss Crawley has spent a sleepless night because
of the smell of pipe tobacco throughout the

844
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:25,869
house.

845
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:29,529
She is to unwell to see you before you leave
the house.

846
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:35,449
And so ended the rectory family's hopes of
receiving Miss Crawley's fortune.

847
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,329
Rawdon and Becky, meanwhile, were enjoying
themselves in Paris, where they had enough

848
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:44,509
money to live in luxury thanks to the huge
price Jos had paid for the horses.

849
00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:48,619
Becky gave birth to a son during their stay
in Paris.

850
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:53,380
Miss Crawley was furious at the news, and
immediately ordered Pitt and Lady Jane to

851
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,809
marry.

852
00:50:54,809 --> 00:50:59,069
She promised to leave them the bulk of her
fortune after her death.

853
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:03,839
The newlyweds settled into Miss Crawley's
Brighton home, and they were all ruled over

854
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,519
by Lady Southdown from her neighbouring house.

855
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:13,650
Lady Southdown was so terrifying that Miss
Crawley lost all her cheerfulness.

856
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,959
She even began to treat Briggs kindly as she
moved slowly towards death.

857
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:30,150
The old lady died clinging in fear to Lady
Jane.

858
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,089
CHAPTER NINE
Life on Nothing a Year

859
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:40,979
News was continually arriving in England of
the terrible casualties of the Battle of Waterloo.

860
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:43,729
The Osborne family learned of George's death.

861
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:48,789
Old Mr Osborne was grief- stricken but he
carried on his business as usual.

862
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:51,900
He never mentioned George's name to anyone.

863
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,999
One day Dobbin's father, Sir William Dobbin,
called at Mr Osborne's house.

864
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:59,519
'My son has sent me a letter for you,' he
explained.

865
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:04,979
Mr Osborne looked at the letter, and his heart
began to beat quickly.

866
00:52:04,979 --> 00:52:07,119
The writing was his son's.

867
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,450
It was the letter George had written before
leaving Amelia in Brussels.

868
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,289
Mr Osborne suffered greatly in this period.

869
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:20,059
He travelled to Belgium to visit the site
of the historic battlefield, and he saw George's

870
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:22,390
burial-place.

871
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:27,930
One evening, as he was coming back into Brussels,
Mr Osborne saw a carriage driving towards

872
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:28,990
him.

873
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,640
An officer was riding by the side of it.

874
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,539
Mr Osborne was surprised to see that one of
the occupants of the carriage was his son's

875
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:40,799
widow Amelia, and that the officer on horseback
was his son's friend Dobbin.

876
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,969
Amelia was pale and withdrawn, and did not
notice her father-in-law.

877
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:49,369
He, however, gazed at her in fury and hatred.

878
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:53,449
A few minutes later Dobbin rode up to Mr Osborne's
carriage.

879
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:57,640
He held out his hand but Mr Osborne refused
to take it.

880
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,719
'I have a message for you,' Dobbin said quietly.

881
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:04,329
'I am the executor of George's will, and am
therefore responsible for his widow's welfare.

882
00:53:04,329 --> 00:53:07,130
Are you aware how little money he left her?'

883
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,749
Dobbin explained that Amelia was expecting
a child.

884
00:53:10,749 --> 00:53:15,640
He tried to persuade Mr Osborne that the time
for hatred and bitterness was gone, and that

885
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,539
Amelia needed his support.

886
00:53:17,539 --> 00:53:22,750
'I have promised to have nothing to do with
that woman, sir,' Mr Osborne commented angrily.

887
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,329
'I shall not change my mind.'

888
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:30,210
Months now passed, and Amelia gave birth to
a son.

889
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:35,689
The loyal Major Dobbin was constantly in attendance
upon her, and brought her back to her parents'

890
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:36,930
house in England.

891
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,589
He became the baby's godfather.

892
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:44,849
The poor girl was so depressed by the death
of George that she did not seem to notice

893
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:46,789
the Major's kindness to her.

894
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:50,410
Dobbin, however, never dared to mention his
love to her.

895
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,529
He knew that Amelia was loyal to her husband's
memory.

896
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:59,650
One day the Major came to Amelia's house looking
particularly serious.

897
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,279
'I'm going away,' he told her.

898
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,539
'I shall be gone a long time.

899
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,289
You'll write to me, won't you, my dear?'

900
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:08,910
'I'll write to you about little Georgy,' Amelia
replied with a smile.

901
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,660
'How kind you've been to us, dear William!'

902
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,640
Three or four years after their triumphant
stay in Paris, Rawdon Crawley and Becky were

903
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,499
living in a fine little house in Curzon Street,
Mayfair.

904
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:24,119
They entertained their friends splendidly.

905
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,599
Yet there were few of their friends who did
not sometimes wonder how Colonel Crawley managed

906
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,049
to live so well.

907
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:34,430
He did not seem to have any income at all.

908
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:39,059
There are many people in Vanity Fair who succeed
very well on nothing a year.

909
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:43,359
The Colonel, for example, was an excellent
card-player, and excelled at billiards and

910
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,119
other games of chance.

911
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,670
He spent many evenings playing against his
friends, and his winnings provided him and

912
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,890
Becky with the small amounts of cash they
required.

913
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,759
For the rest, the couple lived on credit,
as many others in Vanity Fair are obliged

914
00:54:57,759 --> 00:54:59,019
to do.

915
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:04,150
The house in Curzon Street belonged to a Mr
Raggles, who had previously been Miss Crawley's

916
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,359
butler.

917
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:11,660
After leaving Miss Crawley's service, Mr Raggles
and his wife had bought a shop selling foodstuffs.

918
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,900
They worked hard and saved their money carefully.

919
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,369
After many years Mr Raggles was able to buy
the little house in Curzon Street.

920
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:25,599
He intended to rent out the property and was
delighted to have a member of the Crawley

921
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,940
family as his tenant.

922
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,170
The young couple also ordered their food from
the Raggles' shop.

923
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:38,160
One of Becky's first plans when they settled
in London was to establish good relations

924
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,529
with Rawdon's brother, Pitt.

925
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:43,439
He had inherited most of Miss Crawley's fortune.

926
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:48,670
Although Rawdon and Becky had their house
in Mayfair and gave select little parties

927
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:53,210
there, society ladies did not want anything
to do with Becky.

928
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:58,689
They had heard too many unpleasant stories
about her from people like Lady Bareacres.

929
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,789
Most of the visitors to Curzon Street were
gentlemen.

930
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:07,049
Becky found this position humiliating, and
she determined to do something about it.

931
00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:12,729
One of the regular visitors to the Crawley
household was Lord Steyne, a great and powerful

932
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:17,780
nobleman who occupied a very strong position
in London society.

933
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,289
Lord Steyne was one of Becky's greatest admirers.

934
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:25,720
Becky thought that Lord Steyne could introduce
her to London society.

935
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,029
This was not a happy time for Rawdon himself.

936
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:33,390
He knew that people came to the house to see
his brilliant and charming wife, and that

937
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,119
they found him a bore.

938
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,910
He preferred to spend his time with his little
son, Rawdon.

939
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:49,319
He went for long walks with the boy, and he
took him to see his old friends at the barracks.

940
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:54,179
CHAPTER TEN
Misleading Letters

941
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:58,209
Jos Sedley returned to India after his adventures
in Brussels.

942
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:03,789
He sent a small amount of money to his parents
to maintain their modest little house in Fulham.

943
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:07,789
The Sedley household lived in a very small
way.

944
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:12,949
Old Mr Sedley tried various little business
schemes in an effort to recover his fortune,

945
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:15,890
but all of them came to nothing.

946
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:20,559
Amelia herself had no thoughts for anything
except her son.

947
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,099
The family received few visitors now that
Dobbin was abroad again, although the local

948
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:28,789
curate at the church where they worshipped
called quite often.

949
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:34,630
People said the reason for his calls was Amelia,
but she took little notice of the young man.

950
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,489
The years went by, and George grew into a
healthy young boy.

951
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:44,829
He was full of energy, and everyone said he
looked just like his father.

952
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:49,150
Old Sir Pitt Crawley died, to the relief of
all his family.

953
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:53,911
He had become increasingly eccentric in his
final years, and his behaviour had been a

954
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:56,799
scandal throughout the county.

955
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:01,299
His son, Pitt, inherited the property and
the title, and as he had already inherited

956
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:06,630
Miss Crawley's fortune, he was now a man of
substance and importance.

957
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:11,089
His thoughts turned to a career in politics.

958
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:15,709
Rawdon and Becky were, of course, invited
to attend the old man's funeral at Queen's

959
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:16,859
Crawley.

960
00:58:16,859 --> 00:58:18,769
Becky received the invitation with delight.

961
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:20,920
'Why are you so happy about it?'

962
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,869
Rawdon asked in astonishment.

963
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:25,539
'There's no money coming to me from my father's
death.

964
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,929
You don't really want to go, do you?'

965
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:29,449
'Of course we're going!'

966
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:30,449
Becky cried.

967
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:34,769
'Lady Jane shall present me at Court next
year, and Pitt will give you a seat in Parliament!'

968
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:38,740
'What about little Rawdy - is he coming with
us?'

969
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,660
Rawdon asked tenderly.

970
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,319
He did not like being parted from his son
for more than a few days.

971
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,069
'No,' said Becky, 'he can stay here with Briggs
- she'll look after him.'

972
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:54,289
The faithful Briggs had come to work for the
young couple after Miss Crawley's death.

973
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:56,849
The visit was a great success for Becky.

974
00:58:56,849 --> 00:59:01,039
She behaved herself with modesty and tact
in front of the new Sir Pitt Crawley, and

975
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,650
flattered his political ambitions.

976
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:08,340
She talked sentimentally about her son in
front of the kind-hearted Lady Jane, and won

977
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,970
that lady's friendship.

978
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,220
With Lady Jane's mother, the Countess of Southdown,
she talked religion.

979
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,540
Amelia, meanwhile, wrote regularly to Major
Dobbin, who was with the army in India.

980
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,979
She gave him all the news about Georgy.

981
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:25,709
She also visited his sisters sometimes.

982
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:28,930
One day the sisters told her some important
news.

983
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,269
'William's getting married.'

984
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:36,709
She wrote to congratulate him, and to wish
him happiness for the future.

985
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:41,509
Georgy went to see Dobbin's sisters by himself
sometimes, and he came back from one such

986
00:59:41,509 --> 00:59:44,420
visit wearing a beautiful gold watch.

987
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,900
He said that a lady had given it to him.

988
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,949
Amelia guessed that the lady was a member
of the Osborne family.

989
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:58,069
In fact, it was George Osborne's sister, who
had also been visiting the Dobbin sisters.

990
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:03,420
When Miss Osborne arrived home that afternoon,
she told old Mr Osborne that she had seen

991
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,420
Georgy.

992
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,819
'He looks just like his father,' she said
tearfully.

993
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:14,009
The old man did not reply, but he went very
red in the face and began to shake with emotion.

994
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:17,719
He still hated the Sedleys, but he wanted
to see his grandson.

995
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:21,479
Slowу a plan began to form in his mind.

996
01:00:21,479 --> 01:00:26,920
Dobbin was astonished to receive Amelia's
letter congratulating him on his coming marriage.

997
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,599
It was true that Peggy O'Dowd had been trying
to persuade him to marry a relative of hers,

998
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,160
but Dobbin was in love with Amelia.

999
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,039
He was not interested in any other girls.

1000
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:42,910
When he read Amelia's letter he realised that
she did not understand what he felt for her.

1001
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,259
'Don't you realise that it's you I love?'
he thought.

1002
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:49,000
'Don't you remember how I looked after you
when George was killed - how I brought you

1003
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,029
safely back to England?'

1004
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:55,559
A little while later Dobbin received another
letter from England.

1005
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,219
His sisters told him about Amelia.

1006
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:01,289
'She's going to marry the curate at her local
church,' they wrote.

1007
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:04,130
'And Georgy is going to live with his grandfather.'

1008
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,660
Both pieces of news disturbed Dobbin very
much.

1009
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:12,689
'Amelia will not marry again,' he thought,
'and I'm sure she'll never give up Georgy

1010
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:14,430
to Mr Osborne.'

1011
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:19,589
He suspected that she was in trouble, and
once again he was determined to help her.

1012
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:28,660
He immediately asked for urgent leave to go
to England.

1013
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:34,380
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Amelia Makes a Sacrifice

1014
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,309
Becky was now back in London preparing Sir
Pitt Crawley's house for his return there.

1015
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:42,640
Sir Pitt knew that Rawdon and Becky were very
poor.

1016
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,479
He was very fond of money, however, and did
not offer his brother any.

1017
01:01:47,479 --> 01:01:52,059
Little Rawdon thought his mother was the most
beautiful woman in the world, but he preferred

1018
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:57,199
spending time with his father, who talked
to him and played with him.

1019
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:02,289
Becky usually ignored him, and made him eat
in the kitchen when she had visitors.

1020
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:06,730
One evening the boy was in bed when he heard
his mother singing.

1021
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:11,509
Becky had a fine voice, and the little boy
crept downstairs to listen.

1022
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:15,059
He opened the door of the drawing room so
that he could hear better.

1023
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:19,609
Lord Steyne was in the room with his mother,
and he saw the boy.

1024
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:23,819
Becky rushed out of the drawing room and smacked
Rawdon very hard.

1025
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,779
The boy ran away to the kitchen.

1026
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:32,229
'I'm not crying because she hit me,' he told
the servants.

1027
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:37,489
'But why can't I listen when she sings?

1028
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:46,430
She sings for that man, but she never sings
for me!'

1029
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:51,400
Rawdon and Becky had many creditors, but the
sight of Lord Steyne's carriage outside the

1030
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,730
house every night made them confident that
Becky was rich.

1031
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:59,589
They knew that Lord Steyne was one of the
richest men in England.

1032
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:04,459
As for Colonel Crawley, he felt out of place
with the fashionable people who came to visit

1033
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:05,539
his wife.

1034
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:10,369
He spent most of his time playing with little
Rawdon, or dining at one of his clubs with

1035
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,319
his old army friends.

1036
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,949
He saw very little of Becky in this period.

1037
01:03:15,949 --> 01:03:18,199
Trouble came to the Sedley household.

1038
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:23,459
The family had just enough money to live off
from Jos, but old Mr Sedley began to invest

1039
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:25,969
the money that Jos sent from India.

1040
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:30,349
All his investments failed, however, and he
lost the money.

1041
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:33,960
Mrs Sedley was afraid of the tradesmen who
wanted to be paid.

1042
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,640
Amelia did not know anything about the financial
difficulties of the household.

1043
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:45,689
Just when Mrs Sedley was desperate about money,
a letter came for Amelia from old Mr Osborne.

1044
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:49,619
He said that he wanted Georgy to come and
live with him.

1045
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:55,740
He wanted to give the boy a splendid education,
and Mr Osborne promised to leave him all his

1046
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,599
money when he died.

1047
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,679
He also offered to pay Amelia a small allowance.

1048
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:06,380
Amelia was offended by Mr Osborne's offer
and she refused it.

1049
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,669
The great day came for Becky when she was
presented at Court to George IV.

1050
01:04:11,669 --> 01:04:16,240
She attended the event with Sir Pitt and his
wife Lady Jane.

1051
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,849
Everyone noticed that she was wearing some
splendid diamonds for the occasion.

1052
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:22,440
'Where did they come from, Becky?'

1053
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,819
Rawdon asked her in wonder.

1054
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:26,260
'Where do you think, you silly man!'

1055
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,269
she said with a laugh.

1056
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:29,739
'I hired them, of course.

1057
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:35,109
You don't suppose that all the diamonds that
ladies wear to Court belong to them, do you?'

1058
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:40,130
Becky never returned the diamonds to a shop,
however, after her appearance at Court.

1059
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,309
She hid them away in her desk.

1060
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:47,329
The only other person who knew the truth about
them was Lord Steyne.

1061
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:49,759
Lord Steyne called on Becky later that day.

1062
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:52,519
'Send that Briggs woman away,' he complained.

1063
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:55,420
'I can't come here without running into her.'

1064
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:58,369
'I can't,' said Becky sadly.

1065
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:00,789
'I owe her money, you see.

1066
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:04,809
She gave me all her money to invest for her
and I've spent it.'

1067
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:06,930
Lord Steyne swore angrily.

1068
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:11,220
'How much is it?' he asked angrily.

1069
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:15,150
That evening Becky received a cheque from
Lord Steyne.

1070
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,959
She did not pay off her debt to Briggs, however.

1071
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:22,109
She paid some of her other bills, and the
rest of the money she hid away in the desk

1072
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:24,069
with the diamonds.

1073
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:28,059
At last Amelia discovered the truth about
her father's investments.

1074
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:30,789
The Sedleys were now completely ruined.

1075
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:36,799
The only way to save the family was to accept
old Mr Osborne's offer to look after Georgy.

1076
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:41,700
The boy himself was quite excited at the idea
of going to live with his rich relatives.

1077
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,179
He did not realise how much his mother suffered
at the change.

1078
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:52,039
It nearly broke her heart to see the boy go
off to his new home, but there was nothing

1079
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:58,390
else she could do.

1080
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:04,099
CHAPTER TWELVE
Imprisonment and Violence

1081
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:09,299
Little Rawdon had been sent off to an expensive
school paid for by his Lordship, and Briggs

1082
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,249
had been found another job.

1083
01:06:11,249 --> 01:06:16,410
Lord Steyne often passed the evening with
Becky and Rawdon at their house.

1084
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:21,160
One night Becky and Rawdon went to a party
at Lord Steyne's house.

1085
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:26,250
Rawdon stayed behind after his wife left,
to smoke a cigar with Lord Steyne's assistant,

1086
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,349
Wenham.

1087
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:31,009
The two men strolled through the streets together.

1088
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:36,369
Suddenly they were joined by three other men,
one of whom touched Rawdon on the shoulder.

1089
01:06:36,369 --> 01:06:39,160
He knew immediately what it was.

1090
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,640
These men had come to arrest him for debt.

1091
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,539
'Lend me a hundred, Wenham,' Rawdon asked.

1092
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,689
'I haven't got any money,' Wenham replied.

1093
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:50,949
The men took Rawdon off to prison.

1094
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:54,789
He was not worried, as he was sure that Becky
had money to save him.

1095
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:57,949
He wrote her a note explaining what had happened.

1096
01:06:57,949 --> 01:07:00,539
Then he lay down to sleep.

1097
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:04,329
He waited all the next day for some message
from Becky.

1098
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:07,459
At last a letter arrived in the evening.

1099
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:12,990
Becky said she was ill in bed, but that Lord
Steyne had some money to send him.

1100
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:15,479
Rawdon blushed as he read his wife's letter.

1101
01:07:15,479 --> 01:07:19,400
He remembered that he had been walking with
Lord Steyne's assistant when the men arrested

1102
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
him.

1103
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,869
Had there been a plot to get him out of the
way?

1104
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:27,959
He wrote to Sir Pitt Crawley now, and in an
hour Lady Jane arrived with the money that

1105
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,640
he needed.

1106
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,970
Rawdon was ashamed.

1107
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:36,390
He realised that Lady Jane was kind, and he
wanted to change his life.

1108
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,200
Rawdon hurried home.

1109
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,219
He was surprised to see that the drawing room
was lit up, when Becky had told him she was

1110
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:43,219
ill.

1111
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:47,309
He entered the house quietly and approached
the drawing-room door.

1112
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:49,509
He could hear Becky singing.

1113
01:07:49,509 --> 01:07:54,739
When he opened the door he saw that there
were only two people in the room, Becky and

1114
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,429
Lord Steyne.

1115
01:07:56,429 --> 01:08:00,589
He saw that Becky was wearing the splendid
diamonds that were supposed to have been hired

1116
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:02,309
and returned.

1117
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:05,419
Becky looked up in horror as she saw her husband.

1118
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:07,380
'I'm innocent, Rawdon,' she cried.

1119
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,390
'You must believe me, I'm innocent!'

1120
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,249
Lord Steyne, meanwhile, thought that Rawdon
and Becky had planned to trap him.

1121
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:15,400
He was furious.

1122
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,279
'Innocent, you!' he shouted at Becky.

1123
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:22,679
'I've given you thousands of pounds that you
and this man have spent together.

1124
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,369
Don't try to fool me.'

1125
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:28,529
Rawdon hit Lord Steyne, who fell to the floor.

1126
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:33,940
Then he made Becky remove all of her jewellery,
and he hurled it at the frightened nobleman.

1127
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,809
One of the pieces struck Lord Steyne on the
forehead.

1128
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,719
It left a scar that he carried for the rest
of his life.

1129
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:43,469
Now Rawdon made Becky open her desk.

1130
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:48,389
He saw that there was a lot of money inside,
including the cheque from Lord Steyne.

1131
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:51,460
'I'll send this back to him in the morning,'
he told her grimly.

1132
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,659
'You might have got me out of prison,' he
told her sadly.

1133
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:56,770
'I always shared with you.'

1134
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:59,089
Then Rawdon left the house.

1135
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:01,659
Becky understood that he was gone forever.

1136
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:05,630
All her plans had come to nothing.

1137
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:09,219
Rawdon was determined to fight a duel with
Lord Steyne.

1138
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:13,039
First he went to see Sir Pitt to ask him to
look after his son if anything happened to

1139
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:14,039
him.

1140
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:18,900
Then he went to his club to ask one of his
officer friends to arrange the duel.

1141
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,589
Later that day Becky came to see Sir Pitt
Crawley.

1142
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:27,270
Sir Pitt had seen something in that morning's
newspaper that he wanted to discuss with her.

1143
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:31,889
There was an article saying that Colonel Rawdon
Crawley was expected to be appointed Governor

1144
01:09:31,889 --> 01:09:33,810
of Coventry Island.

1145
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:35,730
'It's true,' Becky told him.

1146
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,910
'Lord Steyne organised it for him.

1147
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:41,750
Don't you see, Pitt, everything I did was
for Rawdon.

1148
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,440
I'm innocent!'

1149
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,829
Lady Jane was not happy to see Becky.

1150
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,660
She asked her to leave the house.

1151
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:54,900
Rawdon's army friend had also seen the newspaper
article and he showed it to Rawdon.

1152
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,000
Wenham walked into the club.

1153
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,860
'You're making a terrible mistake, Crawley,'
Wenham said.

1154
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,560
'It was only by chance that your wife and
Lord Steyne were alone in the house that evening.

1155
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,680
My wife and I had also been invited, but we
couldn't come because Mrs Wenham had a headache.'

1156
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,360
Rawdon did not believe Wenham's story, but
he saw that he could not fight Lord Steyne

1157
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,929
now in the light of Wenham's evidence.

1158
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:20,860
He thought very carefully about what he should
do.

1159
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:24,830
In the end he decided to accept the Governorship
of Coventry Island.

1160
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:30,699
He wrote very regularly to little Rawdon from
there, but he never contacted his wife again.

1161
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:35,599
Little Rawdon spent his school holidays with
Sir Pitt and Lady Jane.

1162
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:37,900
Becky herself was now ruined.

1163
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:43,800
Her servants and creditors all demanded to
be paid, and Mr Raggles took his house back.

1164
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,010
He was ruined as well.

1165
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:50,360
Thus Vanity Fair makes other people pay for
its pleasures.

1166
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:57,329
Becky fled the country.

1167
01:10:57,329 --> 01:11:02,119
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Final Destinies

1168
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:05,760
Major Dobbin came as quickly as he could back
to England.

1169
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,719
He met Jos on the journey, and they travelled
together.

1170
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:14,510
Jos told Dobbin that Amelia had not mentioned
any plan to marry, and this news cheered the

1171
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,190
Major up considerably.

1172
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,280
Dobbin hurried to Amelia's house as soon as
he arrived in England.

1173
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:26,480
There he learned that Mrs Sedley had died,
and that Georgy was now living with Mr Osborne.

1174
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,480
Georgy was happy in the old man's house.

1175
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,780
He did not think often about his mother.

1176
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,699
He did not understand her pain.

1177
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:39,840
Mr Sedley died soon after Dobbin's arrival
in the country, and Dobbin was now George's

1178
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,010
guardian.

1179
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:45,510
He had to pay a visit to Mr Osborne to discuss
the boy's futures.

1180
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:50,100
Old Mr Osborne had looked through his son's
papers, and he now realised that Dobbin had

1181
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,170
been sending Amelia money for years.

1182
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:55,890
He asked Dobbin to explain what had happened.

1183
01:11:55,890 --> 01:12:00,630
'Well, sir,' Dobbin told him, 'the marriage
was very much my doing.

1184
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,949
I thought George had gone too far to let Amelia
down.

1185
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:09,300
And so, when she was left without money, I
did what I could to help her.'

1186
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,440
Mr Osborne turned very red in the face.

1187
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,670
'You did me a great injury,' he said.

1188
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,300
'But you're an honest man, sir.

1189
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,670
Let me shake your hand.'

1190
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:24,150
Dobbin did everything he could to make peace
between the Sedley and the Osborne families.

1191
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:28,820
'It's true that Amelia took your son away
from you,' he said once to Mr Osborne, 'but

1192
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:32,739
you have also taken her son away from her.'

1193
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:37,449
Finally Mr Osborne's hatred for the Sedleys
began to fade away.

1194
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:42,420
He made a new will, leaving some money to
Amelia as well as Georgy.

1195
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:48,440
He never met Amelia again, however, because
he died suddenly after a heart attack.

1196
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:53,890
Dobbin, meanwhile, had told Amelia that he
loved her, but all she offered him was her

1197
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,639
friendship and gratitude.

1198
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:01,619
Jos, Amelia, Dobbin and Georgy now went on
a tour of Europe together.

1199
01:13:01,619 --> 01:13:06,090
They stopped at a large town in Germany, and
Jos went off - to play roulette.

1200
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:10,469
He was very surprised to be greeted by the
woman sitting next to him.

1201
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,070
'Mrs Crawley!' he gasped in astonishment.

1202
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:16,230
'Call me Becky,' she replied softly.

1203
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,909
'You always used to.'

1204
01:13:18,909 --> 01:13:22,590
Becky now used all her charm on the gullible
Jos.

1205
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:28,739
She told him that she was very poor now, and
that she had enemies who made her life miserable.

1206
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,989
Jos told Dobbin that he had met Becky.

1207
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:32,250
'Her again!'

1208
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,500
Dobbin exclaimed.

1209
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,940
'She causes trouble everywhere.'

1210
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:41,639
Amelia did not want to see Becky at first,
but at last Jos persuaded her.

1211
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:44,370
He told her that Becky was very unhappy.

1212
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:50,369
The meeting went well, and Jos and Amelia
invited Becky to come and stay in their hotel.

1213
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:53,239
For once Dobbin was angry with Amelia.

1214
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:55,219
'Don't let her come,' he advised her.

1215
01:13:55,219 --> 01:13:58,320
'She wasn't always your friend, Amelia.'

1216
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,960
Amelia was suddenly very angry with Dobbin.

1217
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,691
She remembered how unhappy she had been when
her husband had abandoned her at the ball

1218
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,170
to dance with Becky.

1219
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:08,119
'That was cruel of you!'

1220
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:09,770
she cried.

1221
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:12,730
The next day Dobbin apologised for his remark.

1222
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:16,300
He said that he had heard bad things about
Becky.

1223
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,800
Amelia did not forgive him.

1224
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,300
'I've loved you for many years,' he told her
bitterly.

1225
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,030
'Now I see that you were not worth the devotion
I have spent on you.

1226
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:29,739
You can cherish memories, but you cannot love
as I do.

1227
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:33,659
It's not your fault, but I have decided: I'm
going away.

1228
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,260
I shan't ever come back.'

1229
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:40,110
Becky overheard the argument between Amelia
and Dobbin.

1230
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,590
'She's a fool,' she thought.

1231
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,550
'That man loves her.'

1232
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:47,409
Dobbin left the town and returned to England.

1233
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:52,510
The days went by, and Jos and Becky spent
more time together.

1234
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:55,840
Amelia and Georgy missed Dobbin terribly.

1235
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,619
Amelia wrote to him, but she did not tell
anyone that she had done so.

1236
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:03,150
'You must go away from here,' Becky told Amelia.

1237
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,540
'You must go away and marry again.

1238
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,870
You must accept your faithful friend.'

1239
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,540
'I shall never marry again,' Amelia told her.

1240
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:14,849
'I have tried, but I can't forget George.

1241
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:18,199
He was the only man in my life.'

1242
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:21,130
Becky gave her friend an old letter.

1243
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,830
Amelia was astonished to recognise George's
handwriting.

1244
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:29,699
It was the letter he had put among Becky's
flowers the night of the dance in Brussels.

1245
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:32,520
He had asked Becky to run away with him.

1246
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,610
At first Amelia cried when she thought about
her faithless husband.

1247
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:41,579
Then she began to remember Dobbin and his
constant love for her.

1248
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,969
She realised that she was free to love Dobbin
now!

1249
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:49,650
Soon Amelia and Dobbin were happily married
in England.

1250
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,940
At last Dobbin had married his true love.

1251
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,980
They went to live near Sir Pitt and Lady Jane.

1252
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:59,309
The two families became great friends.

1253
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,500
Jos remained in Europe with Becky.

1254
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,480
There were rumours that Jos was ill, and that
he had taken out a huge insurance policy on

1255
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,239
his life.

1256
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:13,409
Amelia was worried about her brother, and
asked Dobbin to find out what was happening.

1257
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:16,840
Dobbin discovered that Jos and Becky were
in Brussels.

1258
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,739
He managed to see Jos without Becky knowing
about his visit.

1259
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:23,889
Jos looked unwell and he seemed frightened.

1260
01:16:23,889 --> 01:16:27,070
'Don't let Becky know you've been here,' he
begged Dobbin.

1261
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:28,719
'I'm afraid of her.'

1262
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,530
'Come away with me now,' Dobbin suggested.

1263
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:33,840
But it was no good.

1264
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,119
Jos could not bring himself to leave Becky.

1265
01:16:38,119 --> 01:16:41,650
Three months later Jos was dead.

1266
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:46,190
The circumstances were suspicious, and at
first the insurance company refused to pay

1267
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,219
the sum due on his life policy.

1268
01:16:49,219 --> 01:16:54,410
The company had no evidence that Jos's death
was due to unnatural causes, however.

1269
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,719
In the end they paid the money.

1270
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:02,929
Becky, who now called herself 'Lady Crawley',
settled in England once more.

1271
01:17:02,929 --> 01:17:08,170
Her husband Rawdon died of yellow fever on
Coventry Island, six weeks before the death

1272
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,230
of his older brother Sir Pitt Crawley.

1273
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:18,929
The whole Crawley estate thus came to Becky's
son who became Sir Rawdon Crawley.

1274
01:17:18,929 --> 01:17:24,659
He always refused to see his mother, but he
made her a generous allowance.

1275
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:30,349
Amelia and Dobbin saw Becky once again when
they were in London with their children.

1276
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:35,230
Becky smiled as Dobbin and Amelia grabbed
their children and walked quickly away from

1277
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:36,230
her.

1278
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:36,232
- THE END -
