00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,290
CHAPTER ONE
Delivery

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,480
In her house outside the town, Mrs Kennedy
writes her diary, paints the views from her

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,110
windows, and finds no comfort in the world.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:19,360
Every week Charlie Blue delivers a box of
groceries to her door, but she never appears.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:47,600
It is now one year since the accident...

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,570
On Thursdays, after the last delivery of the
long day, which was to the mad Kennedy woman,

7
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,100
Charlie Blue was allowed to keep the van for
the night.

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,680
He could drive home to his mother, proud behind
the wheel of the yellow van, waving to any

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,780
of the boys from his schooldays he might happen
to see in their long gardens, playing with

10
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,670
their children or cutting their midsummer
grass.

11
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,220
The arrangement suited his mother.

12
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,850
She would have the dinner ready for him and
then, after watching their favourite TV programme

13
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,670
Coronation Street together, he would drive
her into town to Horan's Hotel for her weekly

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,510
game of cards.

15
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,500
Tommy Horan also owned the grocery store and
she thought he was a great man, a generous

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,170
man to let her son have the van so that she
could get to her game of cards.

17
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,570
Charlie said nothing, but knew Tommy Horan
to be a bit of a bollocks, selling his tired

18
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,830
vegetables and soft tomatoes and eggs that
were no longer fresh.

19
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,990
He said nothing because his mother could become
as nasty as her twelve-year-old dog, which

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,840
she allowed to sit on her knees while she
fed it with the better bits of meat from her

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,130
dinner plate.

22
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,879
There was a light shower of rain as Charlie
was driving to Mrs Kennedy's.

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,790
The sun appeared strongly again from behind
the clouds, the road shone blackly, and the

24
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,120
smells of fresh-cut grass and warm earth rose
from the fields and came in through the open

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,400
window of the van.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,519
With one hand, Charlie took out a cigarette
from a packet and lit it with his Horan's

27
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,969
Hotel cigarette lighter.

28
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,419
He felt lucky.

29
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:44,889
Lucky to have his driver's licence, lucky
to have his mother still alive, lucky to be

30
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,519
working for Tommy Horan, even if he was an
old bollocks.

31
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,500
August 20

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,930
A month already.

33
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,459
A day just as lovely as that day, the clouds
low over the hills.

34
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,519
Light seed balls blowing across the land like
a first snow.

35
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,610
And I hate this beauty because Bobby cannot
see it.

36
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,959
I paint it but I hate it.

37
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:23,150
With their sharp wings, the birds cut open
the sky and I am delighted to see it bleed.

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,620
From my window, I can see the gate and the
red wallflowers, staining the stones with

39
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,620
their blood.

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,599
At night, the screams of hunted animals comfort
me.

41
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,659
I am not the only one in pain.

42
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:45,819
In the morning, I cannot bear to dress, and
prefer to wear only shadows.

43
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:52,049
I go to each of my fifteen windows and decide
which view to paint today.

44
00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:04,260
I might eat, if my body lets me, and then
I move to my chosen window and start to paint.

45
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,110
Charlie drove carefully around the last bend
before the Kennedy house.

46
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:14,709
It was a year to the day, he realized, since
poor old Foley lost control of his tractor

47
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,700
on this very bend and killed Mrs Kennedy's
young son.

48
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,720
Bobby was his name, only four or five years
of age.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,700
He and his mother were planting flowers at
the foot of the big stone pillars either side

50
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,900
of the gate, when around the corner came Foley,
shouting about the brakes.

51
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,600
The front of the tractor was already too close
to the pillar on the left, throwing up grass

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,750
and earth into the sky.

53
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,280
Mikey Tuohy, who saw the whole thing from
his field above the road, told the police

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,910
in detail what happened.

55
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,780
His story earned him free beer in the pub
for a long time afterwards.

56
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,530
He said the screams of the mother nearly stopped
his heart.

57
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,680
She picked up the boy's body before Tuohy
could get there, and she ran all the way up

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,930
the long driveway to the big house, screaming
the whole time as the boy's head dropped lifelessly

59
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,130
against her arm and shoulder.

60
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,120
Poor old Foley sat on the grass and put his
head in his hands and didn't even recognize

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,260
Tuohy when he reached him.

62
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,820
Tuohy said Foley shouldn't have been allowed
on the road, not even on a bike, because the

63
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,260
old boy was half-blind.

64
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,180
September 3

65
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,560
Horan's got somebody new to deliver the groceries.

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,110
I recognized him: Charles Cullen.

67
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,470
He knocked and stood at the door and stared
out for a long time, out beyond the fields.

68
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,750
At what, I don't know.

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,220
He stretched his arms out wide like Christ
on the cross, to take the whole world to his

70
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,430
heart, perhaps.

71
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,450
Then he yawned and knocked again.

72
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,300
He lifted his T-shirt and scratched his stomach.

73
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,530
With his toe he pushed the box nearer the
wall, and left slowly, looking back occasionally

74
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,400
at the door.

75
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,050
While I was emptying the box afterwards I
discovered a box of chocolates I hadn't asked

76
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,050
for.

77
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,200
I must remember not to pay for that.

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:35,770
Now, at the end of summer, the land is bled
dry and colours are slowly returning to brown.

79
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,950
The cooler air moves against my skin like
long grass.

80
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,640
When the night enters the house, I look for
Bobby.

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:51,630
I want to run a bath and pour warm water over
his small, smooth back.

82
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,980
I want to turn back his soft sheet and lift
him into bed and bring the edge of the sheet

83
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,280
to his chin.

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,000
I want to kiss his eyelids as he sleeps.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Instead, the darkness tears at my own.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,170
Once, last autumn, as darkness was falling,
Charlie saw an owl standing on the right-pillar

87
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,730
of Mrs Kennedy's gate.

88
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,889
It didn't move as Charlie edged the van past
the ruined left pillar and wall, and then

89
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,050
past the gate still on its side since the
accident.

90
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,030
At first, he thought it was a shadow.

91
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,610
He had stopped by the pillar and quietly rolled
down the window, when the top of the fat,

92
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,170
dark shape turned towards him.

93
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:51,550
From the centre of two wide circles two eyes
stared evenly at him, daring him to move,

94
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,230
and then with two or three movements of its
surprisingly wide wings it slowly, coldly,

95
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,760
flew off low over the field towards the trees.

96
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:09,090
Charlie remembered feeling uncomfortable,
judged in some way.

97
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,620
October 9

98
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,580
Charles still brings the groceries.

99
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,580
For the same reason, I both hate and love
him being at my door each week.

100
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,970
He reminds me of a better life.

101
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:30,180
I so clearly remember Charles in my class,
tall and clumsy at his desk.

102
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,950
I had to let him stand in the end.

103
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,169
He was freer that way.

104
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,740
And the day I decided, he had a gift, it comes
back so clearly.

105
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,920
(I hate the way I can remember every detail
of my life before Bobby and Bobby's death!)

106
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
He brought his finished painting up to my
desk and at first, I was disappointed.

107
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,580
'A Beach in Summer' it was called, but everything
in Charles's painting was a different shade

108
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,440
of blue, not just the sea: blue sand, blue
hills, blue boat, and what I thought was a

109
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,920
blue sun.

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,060
I asked Charles why he hadn't used other colours,
and he said in that frightened way he had,

111
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:18,120
'Well, Miss, it's a beach at night-time, you
see.'

112
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,529
Charlie Blue they called him after that.

113
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,189
Maybe he still paints.

114
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:27,550
I hope so.

115
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,350
When the police arrived, Mrs Kennedy wouldn't
let them into the house, Tuohy said.

116
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,690
Nor the priest either.

117
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:41,370
In the end, the police had to break a window
and get in that way.

118
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,559
They found her upstairs washing the child
in the bath.

119
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,249
The bloodstained water went everywhere, over
the walls and the mirror, wetting the priest

120
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:57,730
and the doctor as they forced the dead boy
out of her arms.

121
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:04,180
Dr Murphy phoned his wife, who came over and
stayed in the house.

122
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,110
Mrs Kennedy didn't come out of the bathroom
until the next morning.

123
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:16,880
She came downstairs still covered in blood
and told Mrs Murphy to kindly leave her house.

124
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Hasn't been seen outside her house and garden
since the child was buried.

125
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,350
From the high field Tuohy says he sometimes
sees her sitting all day at one of her windows.

126
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,589
Or walking naked to the woodpile or throwing
bits of food out for her cats.

127
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:42,360
As Charlie drove the van up the driveway,
he looked around for her, as he always did.

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,749
He threw the end of his cigarette out of the
window, thinking to himself that he had only

129
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:54,889
two cigarettes left and that the old bollocks
wouldn't be paying him until tomorrow evening.

130
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,779
He'd better save them.

131
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,779
He looked up at the high field behind Mrs
Kennedy's and guessed that Tuohy was probably

132
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:08,279
spending a lot more time up there than he
needed to.

133
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,730
December 25

134
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,529
I found a Christmas cake I hadn't ordered
in the box of groceries yesterday.

135
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,569
Sometimes a man comes to the gate and stands
there, staring up at the house.

136
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:23,189
Who is he?

137
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,529
I wonder.

138
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,029
He was there last week and again today.

139
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,249
I feel Bobby's presence strongly today.

140
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:37,910
I fetched the Christmas tree from the cellar
and put it in the front room, with coloured

141
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,449
lights and pretty glass balls on it.

142
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,580
I write in its red and blue and green light.

143
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,519
I have wrapped his favourite toys and placed
them under the tree.

144
00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:00,260
I close my eyes and he is there, lying on
the carpet by the tree, opening his presents,

145
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,379
turning his blond head around to smile up
at me, not minding a bit that they're the

146
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,050
same presents as last year.

147
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,750
I drink my wine and eat a piece of Christmas
cake.

148
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,959
Too rich for you, Bobby, too rich.

149
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:22,269
Charlie couldn't imagine his former art teacher
naked.

150
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:27,850
Every other woman in town had spent time naked
in his dreams, even Mrs Simpson in the post

151
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,290
office.

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,980
Mrs Kennedy was older than her but not by
a million years, she could only be forty or

153
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,440
so, and she had had a good shape back then
during his time at school, even if it was

154
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,480
hidden by long dresses and colourful baggy
jackets.

155
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,429
He had liked her.

156
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:50,860
She hadn't laughed at him for being stupid.

157
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,040
She had put up a painting he had done of a
beach at nighttime, right up beside the board

158
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,170
where everybody could see it.

159
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,749
That was good.

160
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:06,720
It was worth being called Charlie Blue for
that.

161
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,220
February 18

162
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,980
This week Charlie hid a couple of oranges
in the box.

163
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:20,040
I love him for these small presents, the only
kisses I receive.

164
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,449
Today the stranger walked up the driveway
to the door.

165
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:31,069
I saw him clearly through the glass, tall,
blond-haired, blue-eyed.

166
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:32,429
Serious.

167
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,380
He just stood there for a long time, unmoving.

168
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:42,670
One of the cats scratched at the kitchen window
and I looked away for a moment.

169
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,739
When I looked back, he was gone.

170
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:54,069
Snow fell again today but a hard sun drove
it into the hungry grass.

171
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,829
Charlie felt sorry for the thin grey mother
cat.

172
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:02,089
She came up to him as he pulled back the side
door of the van.

173
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,410
He reached down to scratch her head and she
replied by rubbing her whole body against

174
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,029
the leg of his jeans.

175
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:15,929
It's not much of a life for you, Charlie said,
not like you used to have, anyway.

176
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:21,129
He was halfway to the front door when he saw
last week's box exactly where he had left

177
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,129
it.

178
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:28,209
A busy line of black ants led from the box
to a hole in the front wall of the house.

179
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:35,360
Confused, he walked up and down for a while,
looking at the front door and windows.

180
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,500
He put the box he was carrying back into the
van, lifted his T-shirt and scratched his

181
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,050
stomach.

182
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:49,980
Near the corner of the house, he saw a torn
egg-box and a pile of clean chicken bones.

183
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,059
April 28

184
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,670
I feel so heavy.

185
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,949
As the world outside grows lighter and fills
with hope, I become heavier.

186
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,930
My paintings are still in winter, almost colourless.

187
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:14,749
I paint from one window now, from Bobby's
room, which gives the best view of the gate.

188
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,870
My handsome stranger is making good progress.

189
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,850
He began by laying out the stones in rows
and writing numbers on them.

190
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:30,089
Sometimes he stood up and looked back up at
me, serious as always, his blond hair not

191
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,399
quite visible from where I sit.

192
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,829
The wall is finished.

193
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:41,310
All that remains are the pillar and the gate.

194
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,660
Charlie smoked a cigarette, then knocked on
the door for the first time since he began

195
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,350
deliveries to Mrs Kennedy nearly a year before.

196
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,190
Just leave the box by the door and she'll
bring the groceries in herself, Horan had

197
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,160
said.

198
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,939
But Charlie couldn't just drop the new box
down beside the old one and let the ants run

199
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,619
all over it.

200
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,339
When he knocked, the door opened.

201
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,450
It hadn't been properly shut.

202
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,250
'Mrs Kennedy?' he called into the shadowy
hall.

203
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,820
May 21

204
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,689
Charlie still leaves his small offerings.

205
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:26,519
Yesterday it was a packet of sweets.

206
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,259
I cannot eat them but I feel grateful and
that feeds me.

207
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:35,160
I heard the owl call again last night.

208
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,499
Closer this time.

209
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:43,319
In my head I could see his long brown body
diving from the sky, the terrified movements

210
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:49,529
of the small animal he caught, the slow beat
of his wings as he rose into the nighttime

211
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,589
trees.

212
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,579
The pillar is almost finished.

213
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:03,759
The gate lies on its side on the grass, ready
to be put back in place.

214
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,510
Charlie felt cold.

215
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:12,589
These thick-walled country houses were impossible
to heat, from a single wood fire, anyway.

216
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,920
His eyes got used to the darkness.

217
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,940
'Mrs Kennedy?' he called again.

218
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,760
He went into the front room.

219
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,820
There was a painting she had been working
on, and others standing against a wall, which

220
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,210
was papered in a flower pattern.

221
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,260
An untidy pile of silver knives and forks
on the carpet.

222
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,990
He closed the door and moved towards the back
of the house, where the kitchen was, he supposed.

223
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,370
This door was open.

224
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,230
He switched on the light.

225
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,230
There was a fridge in the corner, still working.

226
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,230
Three bananas blackened in a glass bowl.

227
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,770
He could see that rats had been here; they
had eaten into the bread and the butter and

228
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,710
there were even tooth marks in a piece of
pink soap in a dish.

229
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,240
Charlie went back out into the hall and stood
at the bottom of the stairs.

230
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,570
He felt colder than ever.

231
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,740
'Mrs Kennedy?' he called and started up the
stairs.

232
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,150
June 20

233
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,280
The days are like children, unwilling to come
in from their play, and tonight the sky is

234
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,040
a gentle purple, as smooth and as tight as
the skin of an aubergine.

235
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,440
I have washed all my brushes for the last
time.

236
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,660
Each one left its own history of colour on
my hands.

237
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:48,631
I emptied the wooden knife-and-fork box and
put them into it, along with all my paints.

238
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:52,080
My present to you, Charlie Blue.

239
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,550
Tomorrow I will walk through the gate.

240
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,400
The smell of paint-cleaner hangs in the air.

241
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:09,000
While Charlie waited for O'Reilly the policeman
and Dr Murphy to finish inside, he smoked

242
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,430
his last cigarette, leaning against the side
of the van, looking out over the trees to

243
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,900
the distant, darkening hills.

244
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:24,570
A yellow light came from the open doorway
and upstairs window of the house.

245
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:31,890
He had just finished his cigarette when O'Reilly
came out and handed him a small wooden box,

246
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,000
told him to go on home, that the ambulance
could take over an hour to get there from

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,260
Ballinasloe and that there was no point in
waiting.

248
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,070
O'Reilly would see him tomorrow.

249
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,790
Ambulances never hurry for the already dead.

250
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:55,010
Charlie drove back into town and parked outside
Horan's Hotel.

251
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,750
The bollocks could keep his van.

252
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,920
Through the hotel window, he could see his
mother at her card game, the dog at her feet.

253
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,500
She must have asked a neighbour to bring her
into town.

254
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,440
The dog sensed his presence, looked out but
did not move.

255
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,580
He reached into the van and took out Mrs Kennedy's
box of brushes and paints from the passenger

256
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
seat.

257
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,780
Shutting the door with his shoulder, he put
her present under his arm and walked on, out

258
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:34,070
past the last lights of the town and into
the blue shadows of the moonlit countryside,

259
00:20:34,070 --> 00:21:03,820
feeling nervous but welcomed, like a stranger
at home in what was once a foreign land.

260
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:17,390
- THE END -
