CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,730
A Gentleman from La Mancha

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,900
In the Spanish village of La Mancha, there
lived a gentleman who loved to read.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,280
His favorite stories were of knights and their
code of chivalry: full of dragons, magic swords,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,980
enchanted forests, and damsels in distress.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,200
This gentleman was not a wealthy man, but
rather a hidalgo.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,040
A hidalgo was a landowner who was richer than
a peasant, but poorer than a nobleman.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,820
His name was Senor Quixano.

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,390
Senor Quixano lived modestly with his housekeeper
and his young niece.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,030
He was a tall, thin man in his fifties.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,320
He was a strong and healthy man, who went
hunting every morning.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,680
However, he started to read adventure stories
all the time.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,119
His best friends, the local priest and the
village barber, were worried.

14
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,820
Their friend suddenly began spending night
and day in his chair, reading adventure books

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,070
through crazed, bloodshot eyes.

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,090
Soon he started thinking these stories were
true.

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:24,170
Finally he went completely crazy.

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,530
Waking up in his reading chair one morning,
Senor Quixano announced, "I'm going to become

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,180
a knight-errant!"

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,550
"A what?" asked his concerned niece.

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:43,930
"A knight-errant is a righter of wrongs, a
friend to the unfortunate, a rescuer of fair

22
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,140
maidens, and a killer of dragons!"

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,820
"But Uncle," she cried, "there are no dragons
in Spain!

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,200
And who are these maidens who need rescuing?"

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,100
The old man went to the attic of his house
and found a rusty old suit of armor.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,490
He put the suit on and felt ready for action.

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,429
In a bold voice, he announced, "Now, to my
faithful steed.

28
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,640
This "steed" was really a worn-out nag.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,430
But to his delusional eyes, it was a valiant
war horse.

30
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,390
"I name you Rocinante, Queen of the hacks!

31
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,849
And I will call myself.

32
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,190
He took a moment to think of the perfect name.

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,590
"Don Quixote!"

34
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,569
"Now I must dedicate my life to a lady!'

35
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,599
"Do you know a lady?"

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,260
sobbed the man's niece, frightened by his
insane ramblings.

37
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,280
"All knights know a lady," the man replied.

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,020
"When I conquer a giant or capture a villain,
I'll parade them in front of her to prove

39
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,260
my love and loyalty."

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,900
Then he remembered stories he had heard of
a beautiful peasant girl from the nearby village

41
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,750
of El Toboso.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,640
Having lost his grip on reality, he decided
that she was a lonely princess.

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,470
"What's her name?"

44
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,549
demanded his niece, hoping to bring him to
his senses.

45
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,120
Quickly, he invented a name.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,730
"All of the sweetest ladies are named Dulcinea.

47
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,640
Her name is Dulcinea del Toboso, and to her
I dedicate my life!

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,260
Don't try to stop me.

49
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,550
I must go!"

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,640
Then he picked up his sword, a cracked old
lance, and a leather shield and marched out

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
to the stable.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,590
A few minutes later, he rode out in search
of his first knightly adventure.

53
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,010
Don Quixote soon realized that he had not
been knighted.

54
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,850
"I must find a lord or lady to dub me a knight,"
he said.

55
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,060
"I don't want to be called a fraud!"

56
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:11,020
All day Don Quixote rode the scorching plain
searching for adventure, but nothing happened.

57
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,520
By sunset, he and Rocinante were hungry and
tired.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,919
In the fading light, the armored man saw an
inn and rode toward it.

59
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:29,490
"Perhaps we'll find shelter at that castle,"
he said to his horse.

60
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,020
The inn was of the common shabby type found
along the highways of Spain.

61
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,650
In front of the inn were two dirty-faced peasant
girls, who watched in shock as this man in

62
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,940
rusty armor approached them.

63
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,860
"Good evening, fair maidens," he said.

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,889
"I am the knight, Don Quixote de La Mancha.

65
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,120
Please summon a trumpeter to announce my arrival."

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,780
In his eyes, this old inn was a great castle
with tall silver towers.

67
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,009
Don Quixote became annoyed when the girls
just giggled.

68
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:07,520
But at this moment, a pig-handler stepped
out of the inn and blew his horn to round

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
up his grunting animals for the night.

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:22,530
Don Quixote mistook the sound of the horn
for a chorus of pipes and trumpets.

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,650
Then the innkeeper came to the knight.

72
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,630
"If you're looking for a bed for the night,
I'm sorry to tell you that we're all full."

73
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:37,540
"Sire, are you the master of this castle?"
asked Don Quixote politely.

74
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,690
Looking at this man in his rusty armor, the
innkeeper realized that he was obviously crazy.

75
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,270
The innkeeper decided to have some fun with
this loon.

76
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,340
"All of the royal apartments in my castle
are full."

77
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,450
"That's okay," replied Don Quixote.

78
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,139
"A good knight has no need for comfort.

79
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll be happy to sleep on the ground with
a rock for a pillow."

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,440
"You're a knight, aren't you?"

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,449
the innkeeper asked mischievously.

82
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,160
"I am an apprentice knight," replied Don Quixote.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,130
"I seek a kind lord who will dub me a knight
with his sword."

84
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,849
"I see," said the innkeeper, "but I'm busy
now caring for my other guests.

85
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,990
I'll be back to you when I get a chance."

86
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:37,810
"Thank you, my lord," replied Don Quixote.

87
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,860
After some rest, Don Quixote grew impatient
and sent for the innkeeper.

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,190
When the innkeeper stumbled out, Don Quixote
said, "Lord, I can wait no longer.

89
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,630
Please tell me what good deed I must do to
earn my knighthood."

90
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:02,240
The innkeeper said, "If you want me to knight
you, stay here and guard my courtyard tonight."

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,199
With that, he turned and stomped off to the
kitchen.

92
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,520
Don Quixote picked up his weapons and walked
to the middle of the courtyard, next to a

93
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
water trough.

94
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,060
Inside, the innkeeper told his guests about
the madman who thought he was a knight in

95
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,060
the courtyard.

96
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,110
A few hours later, a muleteer approached the
trough with his animals.

97
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,720
"Stand back, foolish knight!"

98
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,099
shouted Don Quixote.

99
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,160
"I will defend this magic well to the death!"

100
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,509
"But my mules need water," cried the peasant
as he pushed past Don Quixote.

101
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,889
Swinging his lance, Don Quixote hit the man
on the head and knocked him out.

102
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,940
"I have done my first good deed!"

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,750
exclaimed Don Quixote.

104
00:07:49,750 --> 00:08:05,139
"When this man awakes, I must send him to
my lady Dulcinea to pay his respects."

105
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,130
Alarmed by the noise, the other muleteers
rushed out of the inn and attacked Don Quixote.

106
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,050
"A swarm of evil knights attacks me!"

107
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,240
cried Don Quixote as he blocked their flying
stones with his shield.

108
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,540
The innkeeper realized that he needed to get
rid of this dangerous screwball.

109
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:32,580
"Dear knight," he said to Don Quixote, "forgive
these evil knights and put down your weapons.

110
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,370
You have proved your courage.

111
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,899
I will dub you a knight without delay.

112
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,899
Kneel down."

113
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:43,959
Obediently, Don Quixote knelt amid the straw
and dung of the yard.

114
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:51,720
"I hereby appoint you to the order of righteous
knights," cried the innkeeper, smacking Don

115
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,930
Quixote across the back with his own sword.

116
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:01,230
Don Quixote jumped to his feet excitedly,
"My lord, I owe you everything!"

117
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,040
"Yes, yes," replied the innkeeper.

118
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,339
"Now you must go off on your good-deed doing
and wrong-righting."

119
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,810
"At once!"

120
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:18,000
cried Don Quixote, who hurried to the stable,
mounted Rocinante, and rode out into the dawn

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,420
of La Mancha.

122
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:28,610
Shortly after, Don Quixote spotted a group
of silk merchants coming toward him on the

123
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,610
road.

124
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:36,740
"Here is an opportunity for gallantry."

125
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,240
Riding in front of the group, he blocked the
road.

126
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,490
"Halt, cretins!

127
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:50,220
None shall be allowed to pass without proclaiming
that my lady, Dulcinea del Toboso, is the

128
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,390
most beautiful maiden in the world!"

129
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,209
The traders stopped and looked at each other.

130
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,460
It was obvious to them that they were in the
presence of a madman.

131
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,500
"I want to see her first before I can proclaim
her beauty.

132
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,270
How do we know that she's not just some old
sloppy chops?" said the joker of the group.

133
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,529
"Sloppy chops?"

134
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,970
screamed Don Quixote.

135
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,860
"Prepare to do battle, you impudent knave!"

136
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,490
Don Quixote raised his lance and charged the
group.

137
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,779
But Rocinante was not accustomed to speed
and stumbled.

138
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:38,880
Don Quixote was thrown through the air and
landed in a ditch with a crash.

139
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,190
The merchants went away, laughing loudly.

140
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,360
Hours later, a passing farmer heard a whimper.

141
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,330
He found Don Quixote in the ditch, covered
in mud.

142
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,279
The farmer recognized him as Senor Qixano
from the village.

143
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,770
He hurriedly picked up Don Quixote and carried
him home.

144
00:10:59,770 --> 00:12:25,510
There the knight was tucked safely into his
own bed.

145
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,709
CHAPTER TWO

146
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:34,699
Knight & Squire

147
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:39,959
For two weeks Don Quixote rested in his house,
making everyone think he had regained his

148
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,170
sanity.

149
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:46,300
But he had secretly sold some of his land
to finance his next adventure.

150
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,050
He was also looking for a squire to accompany
him.

151
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,610
The only man Don Quixote found who would work
for him was a fat little farmer named Sancho

152
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,720
Panza.

153
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,330
He was a total dunce.

154
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,519
"This squire job sounds like hard work," said
Sancho.

155
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:11,459
"I'd rather be at home with my family, munching
on a big plate of pork."

156
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,889
Sancho Panza loved wine, food, and afternoon
naps more than anything else.

157
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:24,090
"But squires always receive great prizes of
gold and land from the knights they serve,"

158
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,519
promised Don Quixote.

159
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,840
"If you serve me, you'll surely end up as
the governor of some rich island."

160
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,940
"My own island!"

161
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,139
Sancho repeated, licking his lips.

162
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,010
"Okay, I'll grab my bags and saddle up my
donkey."

163
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,600
Then the two left in the middle of the night
without telling anyone.

164
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,880
By dawn, the two men were in the middle of
a wide plain.

165
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,899
Squinting in the glare of the brilliant sun,
Don Quixote saw thirty or forty windmills

166
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:04,010
in the fields before them.

167
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,540
"Sancho, fortune is smiling upon us!" he called.

168
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,570
"Does that mean it's time for breakfast?"

169
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,709
replied Sancho.

170
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:18,139
"This is no time for eating, you pig.

171
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,030
Look at those giants over there.

172
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,120
I'll kill every one of them.

173
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,820
Our great service will be remembered for centuries!"

174
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,009
"What giants?"

175
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,380
cried Sancho Panza.

176
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,079
"Over there!

177
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,680
The ones with the long arms!"

178
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,180
"But Master, those are windmills."

179
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,160
"Don't contradict me," scolded Don Quixote.

180
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,200
"I know an army of giants when I see them!"

181
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,380
Don Quixote spurred Rocinante into a gallop
and raised his lance.

182
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,660
"Giants!

183
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,180
Prepare to fight!" he shouted.

184
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,930
Charging into the nearest tower, he thrust
the shaft of his lance into a sweeping sail.

185
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,500
The weapon shattered, and the knight was picked
up off his horse and tossed into the air.

186
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,779
He landed with a great "BOOM!"

187
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:22,139
fifty meters away in a large puff of white
dust.

188
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:28,310
Trotting over on his donkey, Sancho Panza
said, "I told you they were windmills."

189
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,300
"You fool!" said Don Quixote.

190
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:38,519
"When I charged those giants, an evil wizard
flew by on an invisible horse and cast a spell

191
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,029
that changed them into windmills!

192
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,519
To rob me of my glory!"

193
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,060
"I see," said Sancho, believing every word
as he helped his master to his feet.

194
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,180
"Don't worry, my squire.

195
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,759
I'll find this wizard and destroy him!"

196
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:04,190
The next morning, they began traveling again
with-out breakfast, to Sancho's dismay.

197
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,880
An hour later, they saw a large cloud of dust
in the distance.

198
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,110
"It must be two bloodthirsty armies in battle!"

199
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,259
exclaimed Don Quixote.

200
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,720
Then he quickly described both of the armies,
including the names of their generals and

201
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,300
fiercest knights which he made up.

202
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,300
"How do we know that this isn't just a trick
by those evil wizards?"

203
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,509
"Can't you hear thousands of marching feet?"

204
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:35,900
yelled Don Quixote, who raised his broken
lance and charged them.

205
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:47,710
"They're not soldiers," cried Sancho, "It's
just a large flock of sheep!"

206
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,560
The knight began skewering the poor sheep
on the end of his lance.

207
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,770
As soon as the shepherds saw him killing their
animals, they began pelting him with stones.

208
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,310
A rock smashed the side of Don Quixote's face
and knocked him off Rocinante.

209
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,280
"Those evil wizards!"

210
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,199
cried Don Quixote, spitting out a mouthful
of blood and the chips of broken teeth.

211
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,929
"They've done it again!"

212
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,890
In a nearby meadow, the knight and the squire
found a place to rest for the night.

213
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,069
"I'll have dinner ready in a minute," said
Sancho.

214
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:34,360
"Oh, Squire, how can you think of eating in
the moment of my greatest despair?"

215
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,830
"There's nothing more important to me than
eating," Sancho said, devouring raw onion

216
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,830
and salami.

217
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,620
"What are you so sad about anyway?"

218
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,370
Holding his throbbing head, the knight answered,
"The loss of half my ear and four teeth saddens

219
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,370
me."

220
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,780
"I'm not surprised.

221
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,100
There will be nothing left of you in a week
or two.

222
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,010
I've never seen a man more miserable.

223
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,080
We should call you the Knight of the Long
Face.

224
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,409
Your chin is almost scraping the ground."

225
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:17,490
"Yes, my squire, that's an excellent name
for such an unhappy knight as myself.

226
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,220
The two realized that they were thirsty.

227
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,230
An hour later, they located a stream in the
forest.

228
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,299
As the sun began to set, they heard a terrible
sound coming from within the depths of the

229
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,799
forest.

230
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,790
"This is an enchanted forest ruled by a terrible
ogre.

231
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,700
I will find and destroy him with my lightning
lance.

232
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:49,570
If I'm not back in three days, go to my lady
Dulcinea and tell her I died valiantly in

233
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,830
her honor."

234
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,970
Sancho Panza was afraid to be left alone,
so he slipped off his donkey and sneaked under

235
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,280
Rocinante's hind legs.

236
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,669
There he tied a loop of rope to hold her still.

237
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:07,030
When Don Quixote tried to spur the nag on,
she could not move.

238
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,650
"What magic is this?"

239
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,659
boomed Don Quixote.

240
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,680
"My steed is held still."

241
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,600
"Oh, it must be that evil wizard again," lied
Sancho.

242
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,010
"Perhaps it would be better to destroy the
ogre in the morning."

243
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:35,730
"Yes, I will break this spell in the morning,"
agreed Don Quixote.

244
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,960
The two men spent the rest of the night trembling
in the forest for fear of the terrible noise

245
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,780
coming from down the river.

246
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,390
At dawn, Sancho slipped the rope from Rocinante's
hind legs.

247
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,680
When Don Quixote mounted her, she could walk.

248
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,760
"I'm free!"

249
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,610
exclaimed the knight happily.

250
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,930
Then they set off to search for the ogre.

251
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,200
But when they found the source of the terrible
crashing sound, it wasn't an ogre but an old

252
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,110
water machine, clanking away under the power
of a water- fail.

253
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,059
Sancho Panza began laughing at Don Quixote's
newest folly.

254
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:24,549
"We just spent the night trembling in fear
of this!" he laughed.

255
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:30,400
The Knight of the Long Face was even more
miserable after this failed adventure.

256
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,570
But late that afternoon, he saw something
that lifted his spirits.

257
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,280
"Look, Sancho, do you see that knight riding
toward us?"

258
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,330
"I see a man on a donkey," replied Sancho.

259
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,960
"That knight is Horatio the Brave, and his
helmet is the most valuable on Earth."

260
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,920
"I think that's a barber's wash basin on his
head."

261
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,210
"No, it's a solid gold battle helmet.

262
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:06,490
I will challenge him and win it!"

263
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:13,190
Don Quixote shouted, "Surrender your helmet,
Horatio, or I'll spear you with my lance!"

264
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,090
"I have no helmet," cried the man.

265
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,560
"I'm just a barber.

266
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,950
This brass basin is for my work.

267
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,690
I put it on my head because it was raining."

268
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,059
"Do you expect me to believe that?"

269
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:32,330
scoffed Don Quixote, drawing his sword.

270
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,279
Don Quixote snatched the basin from the man
and placed it on his head.

271
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:41,010
"The visor is missing, and someone has tried
to melt the gold off.

272
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,940
But I shall wear it with pride."

273
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:51,549
Sancho tried not to giggle at the sight of
Don Quixote with the wash basin on his head.

274
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:57,090
Later they came to a line of a dozen men with
heavy chains around their necks and hands.

275
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,880
Four soldiers herded them, cursing and lashing
them with whips.

276
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,830
"Prisoners," said Sancho, "off to row the
king's boat."

277
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,070
"I don't believe it," said Don Quixote.

278
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,500
"These unfortunate men are being held against
their will.

279
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,960
It is my duty to rescue them."

280
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,080
"Master," said Sancho with alarm, "these men
are terrible criminals.

281
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,570
They must pay for their crimes!"

282
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,940
"Move aside!"

283
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,789
commanded one of the soldiers.

284
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,930
"These men are vulnerable and needy," said
Don Quixote.

285
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,570
"As a knight-errant, I offer them protection!"

286
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,320
"This crazy old fool is out of his mind,"
laughed the sergeant.

287
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,559
"He's got a wash basin on his head!"

288
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,400
As the other soldiers laughed, Don Quixote
smashed the sergeant over the head with his

289
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,190
lance and knocked him unconscious.

290
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,980
The other soldiers attacked him, but the convicts
attacked them faster.

291
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,679
One of the convicts stole the keys from the
sergeant's pocket and unlocked the other criminals.

292
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,490
The convicts overtook the soldiers easily.

293
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,720
"My friends," cried Don Quixote, "I have given
you freedom.

294
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,830
All I ask in return is that you go to the
village of El Toboso and testify of my courage

295
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,250
to my mistress."

296
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:36,049
"He's as crazy as a coconut!"

297
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,679
yelled one of the convicts.

298
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,880
"Grab him!"

299
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,230
The convicts attacked Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza and beat them.

300
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:51,250
They robbed their saddlebags and cracked Don
Quixote's basin on a rock before running away.

301
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,380
Sancho Panza cried, "Now we're going to be
in big trouble.

302
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,440
We'll be wanted men.

303
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:17,940
The Holy Brotherhood Police will be after
us!"

304
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,590
CHAPTER THREE

305
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:27,000
The Giant Killer

306
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,549
To escape from the Holy Brotherhood, Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza fled into the mountains.

307
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:37,880
They traveled high up to desolate lonely country
of the Sierra Moreno range.

308
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:44,549
"All great men go through a period of despair
when they question everything they believe

309
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,160
in," Don Quixote said.

310
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:55,029
He turned to his hungry squire, "I am sending
you to El Toboso, with a message of my love

311
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,640
for Dulcinea.

312
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,720
She must tell me whether she can return my
love or not.

313
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,600
I will stay here and whip myself until you
return."

314
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,669
All Sancho could think about was the feast
he was going to eat as soon as he got back

315
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:12,500
to a village.

316
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:20,240
"Ride quickly, Sancho Panza," commanded Don
Quixote as he took off his armor.

317
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,669
Then he smashed himself in the chest with
a large rock and began to beat himself on

318
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:28,470
the back with a tree branch.

319
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,539
Riding away from the strange scene.

320
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:35,649
Sancho called to his master, "Don't overdo
it, or there'll be nothing left of you before

321
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:42,779
I can return."

322
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:48,299
Halfway to the village, Sancho stopped at
an inn for the feast he had been waiting for.

323
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:53,659
As he approached the door after his big meal,
he came face to face with Don Quixote's old

324
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,620
friends, the priest and the barber.

325
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,290
"Hey, you work for our troubled friend, Senor
Quixano, don't you?"

326
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,090
the priest said to Sancho.

327
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,330
"It's true.

328
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,830
I am his squire."

329
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,580
"How can you believe his nonsense?

330
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,870
Don't you realize he has lost his mind?"

331
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,030
"There have been some strange things happening,"
replied Sancho.

332
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,159
"Where is he now?"

333
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,040
demanded the barber.

334
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,280
"He's in the mountains, waiting for me to
return with an answer from his mistress, the

335
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,450
lady Dulcinea del Toboso."

336
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,110
"Her answer to what?" asked the priest.

337
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,330
"Something about love," answered Sancho.

338
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,230
"Take us to him.

339
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,290
We have to bring him back to the village with
us," said the priest.

340
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,289
"I will, but I warn you he'll never come back
with you."

341
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,240
"Hmm," said the barber, "I have a plan.

342
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,049
I'll be back in a minute."

343
00:26:53,049 --> 00:27:04,360
Shortly after, the barber came back with two
dresses from the innkeeper's wife.

344
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,721
The three traveled back to the mountains.

345
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:10,950
That night, they camped and discussed the
details of their plan.

346
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,490
In the morning, Sancho went off to find Don
Quixote and tell him about the ladies in need

347
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,610
of help.

348
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,299
Meanwhile, the priest and the barber put on
the dresses and began cooking bacon over the

349
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,780
fire for their breakfast.

350
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,549
As they ate and talked, they saw a beautiful
woman passing by.

351
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,980
"We must show ourselves at once,'" said the
priest.

352
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,360
They stepped out to meet her.

353
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,750
The girl screamed when she saw them, and tried
to run away.

354
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,660
"Do not fear us," shouted the priest, "I am
a man of God!"

355
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,149
"If you're a priest, why are you wearing that
dress?"

356
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,149
she questioned.

357
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:56,220
"It's a long story," he replied.

358
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,850
"By the way, why are you wandering these hills?"
asked the barber.

359
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,180
The beautiful young girl then told her sad
story.

360
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,090
"My name is Dorotea.

361
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,809
I am the daughter of a wealthy farmer.

362
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,350
I was to be married to the Duke's son, Ferdinando.

363
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,880
But he left me for another woman.

364
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:30,279
I was so broken-hearted that I came here to
cry away the rest of my days."

365
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,360
Then the priest had an idea.

366
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:39,010
"Perhaps a truly beautiful lady such as yourself
could convince Don Quixote to come back to

367
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,799
our village, rather than an old priest and
barber dressed like women."

368
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,809
Dorotea agreed to their plan and put on one
of the dresses.

369
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,950
When Sancho returned, he led them to Don Quixote,
who was still lashing himself with the branch

370
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,090
of an old olive tree.

371
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,290
Immediately, Dorotea fell to her knees.

372
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,419
"Please, brave knight, a terrible giant is
attacking my father's kingdom.

373
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,470
You must help us!"

374
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,149
"Of course I will help you!

375
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,840
Sancho, prepare my horse.

376
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,049
We leave at once.

377
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:18,200
I cannot refuse a princess in distress."

378
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,049
Later the group arrived at the inn where Sancho
had first met the barber and the priest.

379
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:26,929
The innkeeper ran out to greet them and was
met by the priest.

380
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:33,050
The priest handed him ten gold pieces and
said, "My friend in the iron suit is mad.

381
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,700
He thinks he's a knight and this is a castle.

382
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,820
I ask you only to play along for the night
and let us stay until morning."

383
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:50,130
"Yes, my wife heard something about a lunatic
roaming the valley," said the innkeeper.

384
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,040
"I heard the Holy Brotherhood is searching
for him.

385
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,150
You may stay, but your crazy friend will have
to stay in the hayloft where I keep my wine,

386
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,610
so he won't bother anyone."

387
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,740
The priest and barber agreed.

388
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,730
Long past midnight, after everyone had gone
to bed, the priest awoke to the loud sound

389
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,440
of gushing liquid, as if a river had burst
into the inn.

390
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,380
Suddenly, Sancho Panza stumbled into the room,
covered in blood.

391
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,140
"My master is fighting a giant upstairs!

392
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,919
It's a bloodbath up there!"

393
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,029
The priest helped him up and tasted some of
the redness on his fingers.

394
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,799
"Sancho, this isn't blood, you simpleton.

395
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,320
It's wine!"

396
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,860
Sprinting up the stairs, the priest shuddered
when he saw what had happened.

397
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,740
There was Don Quixote, swinging his sword
and stabbing the huge pigskin sacks full of

398
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,799
wine hung from the ceiling.

399
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,350
"Ah ha!" cried Don Quixote as the wine splashed
out over him, blinding his eyes.

400
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,060
"Another fatal wound.

401
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,799
Soon there will be no more blood left in your
body.

402
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,870
Victory will be mine!"

403
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,580
The innkeeper raced upstairs screaming, "Oh
no, you're a madman.

404
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,799
My best wine is all gone.

405
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,370
My wife has sent for the Holy Brotherhood.

406
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,880
You'll pay for all of this damage!"

407
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,830
As the officers of the Holy Brotherhood arrived
to arrest Don Quixote, the priest came and

408
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,029
took one of the officers aside for a moment.

409
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:32,390
He explained that Don Quixote was crazy and
needed to be taken home for medical attention.

410
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,799
The priest also told the officer to have his
men put some chalk on their faces.

411
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,970
Soon after, Dorotea came to Don Quixote.

412
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:46,380
"Brave knight, you have slain the giant and
saved my father's kingdom.

413
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,760
I thank you."

414
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,149
"It was my pleasure, dear princess,' said
Don Quixote.

415
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,770
Suddenly the knight was surrounded by eight
ghostly figures with white faces.

416
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,809
One of them stepped forward and said,

417
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:06,480
"We are demons, sent by the evil wizard to
take you back to your village!

418
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,429
Get into this cage!"

419
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:14,610
Don Quixote tried to fight, but the eight
men seized him and locked him into the cage.

420
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,690
Don Quixote struggled to break free from the
cage until his strength was gone.

421
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:41,029
Then he fell asleep.

422
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,320
CHAPTER FOUR

423
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,919
New Quest

424
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,970
Don Quixote stayed in bed for several weeks.

425
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,419
His niece and housekeeper watched him closely,
hoping his knightly madness was finished.

426
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:02,679
One day, the barber and the priest visited
him.

427
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:10,290
"I'm fully recovered and ready to get back
to my old life," said Don Quixote.

428
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:17,870
"So old friend," asked the priest, "what do
you think our king should do about this Turkish

429
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,840
sultan who has threatened to attack our shores?"

430
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:28,360
"I would hold a jousting contest to find the
bravest knight in all of Spain," said Don

431
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
Quixote.

432
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,639
"Then I would send that single courageous
knight to conquer the sultan's armies."

433
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:41,769
Don Quixote sat up in bed, demonstrating the
sword thrusts to destroy the sultan's forces.

434
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:48,820
"Oh dear," said the barber to the priest,
"it seems as if our friend's sanity has not

435
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
returned.

436
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:56,370
We may have to employ more shocking tactics
to bring his mind back."

437
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,529
Suddenly Sancho squeezed into the room with
a grin on his face and gave the old knight

438
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:01,730
some good news.

439
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:08,119
"Last night I was at a party to welcome back
young Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca

440
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,839
University.

441
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,540
Before I could say 'hello', he told me he
had read about all of our adventures," said

442
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Sancho.

443
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,040
"Somebody wrote a book called Don Quixote,
and it's the biggest bestseller in all of

444
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Spain!"

445
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,379
"Bring him to me, my squire.

446
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:34,649
I must meet this young man," said Don Quixote.

447
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:40,000
A few minutes later, Sancho returned, leading
a young man with a chubby face and a mischievous

448
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,429
expression into the room.

449
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:49,020
Before Don Quixote could speak, the youth
fell onto his knees and said, "Oh, great knight,

450
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,840
I'm humbled to be in your excellent presence!"

451
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Carrasco kept talking, trying to control his
giggles.

452
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,060
"In all the history of chivalry, no one can
find a braver, more extraordinary knight than

453
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,109
Don Quixote.

454
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,070
The book is beloved by every man and woman
in every social class.

455
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,680
The author is even talking about writing part
two!"

456
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:21,230
"Well then," cried Don Quixote, hopping out
of bed, "it's time to get back in the saddle.

457
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:29,170
My public needs me!"

458
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:35,200
Seven days later, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza
saddled their mounts and prepared to ride.

459
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,730
Carrasco was there to wish them farewell.

460
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,740
Suddenly the housekeeper and niece burst out
of the house and cried, "What's going on here?

461
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,880
Where's the priest?

462
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,190
He must stop this madness!"

463
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,829
Carrasco whispered to them, "Don't worry.

464
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:54,040
The priest and I have a plan to bring him
home.

465
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,170
You'll see in a day or two."

466
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,589
Then Don Quixote shouted farewell, and they
rode off.

467
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:06,240
"So what's our first move?" asked Sancho after
they had been riding for an hour.

468
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,930
"We are riding to El Toboso where you will
guide me to the palace of my mistress."

469
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,450
"Oh no," fretted Sancho.

470
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:24,440
"I'm not sure I can remember where she lives."

471
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,079
Later they found themselves riding around
the dark streets of El Toboso, hopelessly

472
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,380
lost.

473
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,950
Sancho convinced Don Quixote that they should
wait until morning to find Dulcinea.

474
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,430
After eating breakfast at their campsite,
Sancho rode off, trying to figure out what

475
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:46,650
to do.

476
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,420
As he was trying to think of a solution, Sancho
saw three peasant girls riding across the

477
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,650
plain on donkeys.

478
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,140
He had an idea.

479
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,710
He turned around and rode back to camp.

480
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,430
"Master, I have great news," he cried.

481
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,950
"Will she allow me to visit?"

482
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,800
Don Quixote asked hopefully.

483
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,000
"Polish your suit.

484
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,900
She couldn't wait for your visit.

485
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,369
She's riding here with two of her maids."

486
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:16,710
Don Quixote ran around in a panic.

487
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,140
Sancho helped him into his armor, and minutes
later they were riding through the trees.

488
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,310
"Where is she?"

489
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,060
cried Don Quixote.

490
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:31,320
"Over there," said Sancho, pointing to the
peasant girls who were riding past.

491
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,630
"All I see are three ugly girls on donkeys,"
said Don Quixote.

492
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:43,349
"But sir, those are the prettiest women I
have ever seen."

493
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:50,560
Don Quixote walked up to them and asked the
one in the middle, "Are you my mistress, Princess?

494
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,730
Are you Dulcinea, the sweetest rose in Spain?"

495
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:05,319
The girl let out a big laugh, "Sorry, Granddad,
I can't waste time talking with lunatics."

496
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,780
Then she kicked Sancho so hard he almost fell
off his donkey.

497
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,570
The girls rode off, leaving Don Quixote in
a cloud of dust.

498
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:25,630
"The evil wizard has changed my love into
a disgusting country wench!"

499
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,440
cried Don Quixote.

500
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,350
"It's terrible," cried Sancho, clapping his
hands with glee because his plan was working

501
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,450
so well.

502
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,770
"Now I am truly the Knight of the Long Face.

503
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,710
This evil wizard has struck me in my weakest
spot!

504
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:52,410
I must find a way to break his spell and restore
her beauty!"

505
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:59,570
Don Quixote spent the rest of that day crying
in the woods, reciting poetry about lost love.

506
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,870
Sancho contented himself with two salamis
and a leather cask of wine.

507
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:10,400
Suddenly Don Quixote hissed, "I hear two men
approaching in the forest."

508
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,530
"Where?" asked Sancho.

509
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,829
"On the other side of those bushes."

510
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,830
Then the two sat and listened.

511
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:25,839
"My lady, Casilda, is the most lovely woman
in Spain!" said the voice.

512
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,560
"And she has sent me, the Knight of the Forest,
on my mission to destroy all knights who would

513
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,630
disagree."

514
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:40,079
"This knight lies," whispered Don Quixote.

515
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,079
"You are mistaken!"

516
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,010
shouted Don Quixote, stepping out of the bushes
to face the knight.

517
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:56,140
"I must tell you that my Dulcinea is the most
beautiful woman on Earth."

518
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,640
"Then we must do battle," the other knight
replied coolly.

519
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,900
"We will joust at dawn," replied Don Quixote.

520
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,970
"Yes, but there is one condition.

521
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:14,310
The loser must return to his village and swear
to stay there and not enter any combat for

522
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,050
one year."

523
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:24,430
"I accept," answered Don Quixote.

524
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,359
The next morning at dawn, the knights met
on opposite sides of a clearing.

525
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,060
To the left of the Knight of the Forest was
his squire, a hunchback with a large purple

526
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
nose.

527
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,640
Without warning, the Knight of the Forest
spurred his steed into a gallop and charged

528
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,230
Don Quixote with his lance.

529
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,850
Don Quixote immediately raised his lance.

530
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,660
At the last moment, the Knight of the Forest's
horse neighed and refused to take another

531
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,869
step.

532
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:59,530
Don Quixote charged with all his might and
knocked the other knight out of his saddle.

533
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:05,070
Don Quixote quickly jumped down from Rocinante,
drawing his sword and holding it to the downed

534
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,520
knight's neck.

535
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,220
"Do you surrender?"

536
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,040
Don Quixote demanded.

537
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,380
"Yes," cried the Knight of the Forest, "I'm
finished."

538
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,890
Then Don Quixote commanded Sancho to remove
the knight's helmet.

539
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:30,569
"Well," cried Sancho, "this knight looks like
that youth Carrasco!"

540
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:35,130
"Yes, he does," agreed Don Quixote.

541
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:41,250
"The power of this evil wizard to change people's
faces is amazing."

542
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,200
"No, I really am Carrasco," sobbed the student.

543
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,750
"It would be safer to kill him now," said
Sancho.

544
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:57,100
Don Quixote raised his sword to strike, but
the hunchback rushed over and flung off his

545
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,240
robe.

546
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,040
It was Don Quixote's friend, the barber.

547
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,540
"Put your sword away," he said.

548
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,849
"Amazing," said Don Quixote, "This evil wizard
never stops."

549
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:16,870
The barber dragged Carrasco away toward their
campsite, cursing him for not being better

550
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:23,540
in a joust.

551
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,650
The next morning found Don Quixote and Sancho
Panza riding through a wheat field.

552
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,420
The victory over the Knight of the Forest
left Don Quixote feeling unstoppable.

553
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,309
He didn't suspect for a moment that it had
been a plot hatched by the priest to bring

554
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:45,030
him back to the village.

555
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,130
Stepping onto the road, the knight and his
squire came upon a royal cart.

556
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,220
Raising his lance, Don Quixote blocked the
cart and said, "Halt, or I'll slice you in

557
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
two.

558
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,470
I demand to know what you have in this cart."

559
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:07,150
"A lion," called one of the cart drivers,
"A gift to our king from an African prince."

560
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,290
"Dangerous?"

561
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,620
asked Don Quixote.

562
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,930
"It's thirsty for blood.

563
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,590
It's even more dangerous because it's hungry.

564
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,850
So clear off, old man, before you get hurt."

565
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,660
"I am Don Quixote," proclaimed the knight.

566
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,059
"And I'm not afraid of any pussy cats!"

567
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:31,570
Then he swung his lance below the driver's
nose.

568
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,280
"Open the cage!"

569
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,430
Sancho and the driver's mate quickly ran up
a nearby hill, while Don Quixote positioned

570
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,309
himself in front of the lion's cage, and the
driver prepared to pull a rope that would

571
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:46,460
open it.

572
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,309
"Will you reconsider?" asked the driver.

573
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:54,740
"Don Quixote does not fear danger!"

574
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,550
shouted the knight.

575
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,990
"Pull!"

576
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:03,589
The door crashed open, and a gigantic lion
stuck his head into the air.

577
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:09,619
His jaws were black and covered with thick
drool, his teeth yellow and curved like knives.

578
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:16,809
The lion's eyes blazed as if on fire.

579
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:26,250
"I'm waiting for you, King of the jungle,"
Don Quixote cried fearlessly.

580
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,540
"Are you afraid to come out?"

581
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,600
The lion stared at the old knight for a moment,
and then yawned and went to sleep.

582
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,540
"This lion is a coward!"

583
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,050
shouted Don Quixote.

584
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,210
"Driver, rattle his cage.

585
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,420
Make him roar!"

586
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,750
"I will not!"

587
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,460
replied the driver, dropping the rope that
closed the lion's cage.

588
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,540
"You are the bravest man in Spain.

589
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,050
No one else would go up against a man-killer."

590
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:58,990
"Will you swear to our king?" asked Don Quixote.

591
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:05,000
"He will receive a full report of your bravery,"
replied the driver.

592
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,170
Don Quixote signaled to Sancho and the driver's
mate that it was safe to return.

593
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:19,250
"From this day on," announced Don Quixote,
"I wish to be known as the Knight of the Lions.

594
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:41,940
Men will tell tales of this adventure hundreds
of years to come!"

595
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,210
CHAPTER FIVE

596
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:52,390
The Final Adventures

597
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:57,940
Sancho grumbled and sulked for three days
as Don Quixote led them through the forest.

598
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,150
Their food was almost gone, and the squire
had to go to sleep hungry, under a damp blanket

599
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,630
worrying about wolves and other predators.

600
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,300
Don Quixote was proud of their sufferings,
often reminding Sancho that "a hard life makes

601
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,720
a brave heart."

602
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,890
On the fourth day, at sunset, they came across
a group of riders.

603
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:22,309
Among them was a lady dressed in green velvet.

604
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:27,090
She sat atop a majestic white stallion and
held a falcon on her arm.

605
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:31,440
"A huntress," gasped Don Quixote.

606
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,550
"Perhaps even a princess.

607
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,780
She'll certainly want to be introduced to
me."

608
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,980
"She probably just wants us to mind our own
business," Sancho replied with a grin.

609
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:51,180
Ignoring his squire, the knight commanded
him, "Ride over there and introduce me."

610
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,579
Sancho groaned and spurred his donkey in the
group's direction.

611
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,470
"My lady," he called.

612
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:04,130
"My master, the Knight of the Lions, formerly
known as the Knight of the Long Face, wishes

613
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,130
to…

614
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,420
"Wait," interrupted the lady, "Did you say
the Knight of the Long Face?"

615
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,200
"Yes, and I'm his squire, Sancho..."

616
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,670
"Panza?"

617
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,520
interrupted the lady again with a smile.

618
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,150
"Yes," gulped Sancho.

619
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:26,170
"Do you know about us?"

620
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,440
"Of course," she replied.

621
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,599
"I've read the book of your adventures.

622
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,550
It's my husband's and my favorite book!"

623
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,309
"Shall I bring him over then?" asked Sancho.

624
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:43,599
"You must do more than that," said the lady.

625
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,270
"You and your master must come to our nearby
castle as distinguished guests of my husband,

626
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,869
the Duke."

627
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,201
The Duchess giggled when Sancho accepted her
invitation.

628
00:47:54,201 --> 00:48:00,650
In truth, she and her husband thought the
book Don Quixote was the finest comedy ever

629
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,770
written.

630
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,589
She and her husband were great jokers, and
she figured they would be able to have some

631
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:13,590
fun with the crazy knight and his dim-witted
sidekick.

632
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:18,130
The group with Don Quixote and Sancho soon
crossed a drawbridge and found themselves

633
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,400
inside a vast, opulent castle.

634
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,540
Two trumpeters sounded the knight's arrival,
and a group of maidens surrounded them, fanning

635
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,220
jars of perfume.

636
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:37,270
That night, the knight and his squire ate
the best meal of their lives while chatting

637
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,109
with their hosts.

638
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:44,190
The Duke and Duchess listened with great interest
about all of their recent adventures.

639
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,369
But their greatest interest was in hearing
news of Dulcinea.

640
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:54,680
When they asked about Dulcinea, the knight
replied sadly, "My beautiful lady has been

641
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,650
transformed into a vulgar, donkey-riding trollop
by an evil wizard."

642
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,970
"How terrible!"

643
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:10,120
gasped the Duchess, barely able to contain
her laughter.

644
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,070
The next day, the Duke and Duchess convinced
Don Quixote to accompany them on a wild boar

645
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,400
hunt in the forest.

646
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:23,990
But they had made secret plans to play a big
joke on the knight and his squire.

647
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,190
While they were hunting, there was a sudden
noise coming through the trees.

648
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:31,220
"My men must have found a boar.

649
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,030
It's coming toward us.

650
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,720
Beware its tusks!" said the Duchess.

651
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,710
But when the trees parted, there was no wild
boar.

652
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,309
Rather, a black stallion came prancing and
kicking before them.

653
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:51,059
On its back rode a man, covered in twigs,
leaves, and ivy.

654
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,930
"I am the forest sprite!"

655
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,700
the strange figure wearing a green mask with
horns on top of his head shouted.

656
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:05,450
"The demons of the forest have sent me with
a message for the knight-errant, Don Quixote

657
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:06,599
de La Mancha!"

658
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,630
"I am Don Quixote," replied the knight.

659
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:18,490
"To free your lady from their spell," the
sprite continued, "you must do two things.

660
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,790
First of all, your squire must lash himself."

661
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,119
"How many times?"

662
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,530
screamed Sancho.

663
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,000
"Three thousand, three hundred times."

664
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,110
Sancho gasped in disbelief.

665
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:37,800
"But first, you must ride a flying horse through
the air and over the mountains.

666
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,700
This horse waits for you at the Duke's castle.

667
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,890
If you are brave enough to perform these two
tasks, your beloved Dulcinea will be set free,"

668
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,040
said the forest sprite.

669
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,349
Then the creature turned and rode away.

670
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,210
"It's a miracle!"

671
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:00,440
cried the Duchess, "We must return to the
castle at once!"

672
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,190
"Yes, but first, Sancho, fetch me a whip,"
shouted Don Quixote.

673
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,290
"You can begin lashing yourself while we ride!"

674
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:14,440
The terrified squire had already ridden away
from the knight's grasp.

675
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:23,460
Back at the castle, the servants were rushing
around, shouting alarm from the towers.

676
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,030
There was a giant wooden horse in the middle
of the courtyard.

677
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:31,869
The servants told the Duke it had suddenly
and mysteriously dropped from the sky.

678
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:37,490
Meanwhile, Don Quixote and Sancho were arguing
about the lashes the squire must suffer to

679
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,790
free Dulcinea.

680
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,500
"I won't do it," cried the squire.

681
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:49,309
"For the sake of my lady, I beg you," sobbed
the knight.

682
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,359
The Duchess approached them.

683
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:58,440
"You two must cease your squabbling," she
said, leading them into the courtyard.

684
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,319
She was enjoying every moment of this grand
practical joke she had planned with her husband.

685
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,821
Don Quixote stared up at the wooden horse
in amazement.

686
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:08,670
"What a creature!

687
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:13,799
It must be twenty feet tall!"

688
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,610
Sancho's knees knocked together in fear.

689
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,500
There was a rope ladder on the side which
they climbed up.

690
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:26,460
Seeing them mount the wooden horse, the Duke
and Duchess could hardly control their laughter.

691
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,040
When the two seated themselves on top of the
horse, Sancho found there was nothing to hold

692
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,109
on to.

693
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:37,520
So he grabbed onto Don Quixote's trouser belt
with both hands.

694
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:46,250
"There is a carving in the wood here!"

695
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,010
exclaimed Don Quixote.

696
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,230
"It says we have to blindfold ourselves.

697
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,930
Anyone who rides this magic horse without
a blindfold will be struck dead!"

698
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,450
"I've got a handkerchief!" said Sancho.

699
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:06,270
He pulled out his handkerchief, tore it in
two, and gave half to his master.

700
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,609
The two fixed the smelly halves of handkerchief
around their faces.

701
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:14,950
From a balcony, the Duchess and Duke squealed
with pleasure at the sight of the two fools

702
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,319
on the horse.

703
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,290
Once their eyes were covered, a servant tapped
on the horse, and the servants inside lifted

704
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,910
it three feet off the ground and rocked it
from side to side.

705
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,790
"We're up in the clouds, Sancho," cried Don
Quixote,

706
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,589
"I'm feeling airsick," moaned Sancho.

707
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:41,250
On a balcony across from the knight and squire,
four maidens were pumping a pair of bellows

708
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,220
and dousing them with cups of water.

709
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,619
"Hold on, Sancho.

710
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:50,390
We're flying through a rainstorm!"

711
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:55,869
called Don Quixote.

712
00:53:55,869 --> 00:54:00,089
At this point, the Duke and Duchess were laughing
their socks off.

713
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:04,809
But they were also beginning to feel guilty
for playing such a prank on the good knight.

714
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:08,630
The Duke signaled to his butler for the grand
finale.

715
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,730
A servant lit the horse's tail on fire.

716
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:19,819
There was a "POP" and a "FIZZ" as hundreds
of fireworks hidden inside the tail exploded.

717
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:23,609
Sancho wrapped his arms around the knight
and howled, "Save me, Master.

718
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:26,420
I promise I'll suffer the lashing!"

719
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,230
"All of them?" asked Don Quixote.

720
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,140
"Every one!"

721
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,000
cried Sancho.

722
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,819
Then Don Quixote beat the top of the horse
with his fist.

723
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:41,160
But this only made the men inside rock it
harder.

724
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:49,970
Finally, they tilted it too far, and the wooden
horse crashed to the ground.

725
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:55,260
Sancho and the knight were thrown to safety,
landing on the soft grass of the castle lawn.

726
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,270
Quickly the servants carried the horse away.

727
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:03,840
By the time Don Quixote and Sancho tore the
rags from their eyes, they were facing the

728
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,010
Duchess who leaned over them, acting concerned.

729
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:13,650
"Welcome back," she said softly, "You've been
gone for hours.

730
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,580
We were so worried.

731
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,319
How was the ride?"

732
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,880
Sancho and Don Quixote rested for a few days.

733
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,890
Then the knight announced it was time for
them to leave.

734
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,049
"But what about Sancho's lashing?"

735
00:55:29,049 --> 00:55:31,730
asked the Duchess, who didn't want to miss
out on the spectacle.

736
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,710
"He'll have to carry out the lashes while
we travel.

737
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:39,160
Life at court is softening my sword arm.

738
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,210
It is time for us to go.

739
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,490
I thank you for your hospitality."

740
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:53,290
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rode away toward
the sea and the city of Barcelona.

741
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:59,250
The next morning, Don Quixote told Sancho,
"I want to see you do some whipping right

742
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,250
now."

743
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,569
"Don't rush me," cried Sancho, jumping to
his feet.

744
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:08,000
"And I prefer to perform my lashing in private."

745
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,670
"I don't care how you do it, but I want to
hear each lash so I know you're not shirking."

746
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:19,869
"Fine," snapped Sancho, "I'll get started."

747
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,780
He grabbed the whip and stomped off into the
trees.

748
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:28,640
Then he unbuttoned his shirt and cracked the
whip against the trunk of the tree.

749
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,730
"Ow!" he yelled.

750
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,250
"That one almost drew blood!"

751
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:46,380
A few days later, when Don Quixote and Sancho
rode into Barcelona, word had already spread

752
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,250
of their arrival.

753
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:53,480
The streets were filled with citizens trying
to get a glimpse of the crazy yet noble knight.

754
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,070
People threw flowers and cheered.

755
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:02,319
The leader of their escort allowed Don Quixote
and Sancho to stay in his luxurious villa

756
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,130
in the middle of the city.

757
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,170
For two weeks they lived like kings.

758
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:16,670
They were paid daily visits by generals, admirals,
and high-ranking public officials.

759
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:22,030
Each morning, Don Quixote would take Rocinante
for a trot along the beach.

760
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:26,589
Then one day, as he was on his morning jaunt,
he saw a figure approaching him from down

761
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:28,140
the beach.

762
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,130
The figure was a knight, wearing a full suit
of armor with his visor lowered.

763
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:38,450
When Don Quixote neared the knight, he could
see a white crescent emblem on his chest.

764
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:41,609
"Halt, the Knight of the Lions!"

765
00:57:41,609 --> 00:57:43,230
called the Knight of the White Moon.

766
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:47,960
"I have a challenge for you."

767
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:56,559
"Don Quixote is always ready for a challenge,"
the old hidalgo answered bravely.

768
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,430
"Then we will joust," said the strange knight,
raising a shiny new lance.

769
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:06,880
"Name your terms," called Don Quixote.

770
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,510
"If you win, this fine horse and my new lance
are yours.

771
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:16,359
If I am the victor, you must retire from your
career as a knight-errant."

772
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,020
"Retire?"

773
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,410
cried Don Quixote.

774
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,940
"But that is impossible."

775
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:27,190
"We young knights are tired of you getting
all of the public's attention.

776
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,970
We want you to return to your village for
a year and live a peaceful life."

777
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,980
"I accept your terms!"

778
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:42,049
snapped Don Quixote.

779
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:46,339
Then both knights turned away from each other
and checked their weapons.

780
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:51,000
When they turned, the Knight of the White
Moon spurred his horse into a gallop and thrust

781
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,089
his lance toward Don Quixote.

782
00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:59,619
He held his lance with such precision that
the elderly knight didn't have a chance and

783
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,950
was thrown from his saddle.

784
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,849
He landed in the shallow water and sand of
the beach.

785
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:11,140
In a flash, the Knight of the White Moon dismounted
and pressed his sword to Don Quixote's neck.

786
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,280
"You are vanquished.

787
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,150
Do you concede?"

788
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,640
demanded the Knight of the White Moon.

789
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,369
"But it means the end of my life," sobbed
Don Quixote.

790
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:25,329
"Without chivalry, I am nothing."

791
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:30,120
"You gave your word," snarled the victor.

792
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:38,549
"I will retire," coughed Don Quixote, "as
I promised."

793
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:43,010
The knight's tears of defeat mixed with the
salt water of the waves.

794
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:49,280
"This is the darkest day of all my adventures,"
he moaned.

795
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,140
But the Knight of the White Moon showed no
mercy and rode off on his stallion.

796
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,180
The broken hidalgo sat, sobbing in the surf.

797
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,430
Later, Don Quixote hobbled back to town.

798
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:07,670
He never realized that the Knight of the White
Moon was actually the youth, Carrasco.

799
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,290
In the months since he had been defeated as
the Knight of the Forest, he had studied jousting

800
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,059
and horsemanship.

801
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:19,390
He was determined to have his revenge on Don
Quixote and to return the crazy hidalgo to

802
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,690
his friends in the village.

803
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,930
When Sancho heard of Don Quixote's defeat
and retirement, he sobbed.

804
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:30,580
"You can't quit, Sire. Old dogs don't learn
new tricks."

805
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,530
"I promised.

806
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,480
Now help me take off my armor.

807
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,260
I no longer need it."

808
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:45,589
As the two began their three-day journey home,
they lamented their fate.

809
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:49,089
One night, the two men made camp by a stream.

810
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:52,890
Sancho had been trying to lift the broken-hearted
knight's spirits all day.

811
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:57,380
"Can I do anything to make you feel better?"
he asked.

812
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:06,339
"If I knew my lady was safe," said Don Quixote,
"I might be able to smile again."

813
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:11,480
So Sancho wandered off into the nearby woods
and lashed a tree letting out blood-chilling

814
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,069
cries with each crack of the whip.

815
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:19,980
When Sancho had lashed all the bark off the
tree, Don Quixote told him he had finished

816
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,440
a thousand lashes and he stopped for the day.

817
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,310
"I am proud of you," Don Quixote told him
warmly.

818
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:35,690
"If you can manage a thousand per night, Dulcinea
will be free by the time we reach our village."

819
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:41,230
They rode hard each day, passing by many sights
of past adventures.

820
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:46,309
Each night, Sancho found a suitable tree to
whip and rack up another thousand lashes.

821
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:51,830
On the fourth morning, he completed the final
two hundred and forty-eight lashes.

822
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:56,960
Don Quixote shook his hand and promised to
double his salary if they ever went questing

823
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,599
again.

824
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:09,319
When Don Quixote rode into the courtyard of
his home, the housekeeper dropped her basket

825
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,200
of laundry in the dust.

826
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,599
"Master, you're back in one piece," she cried.

827
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:24,289
"I am weak," whispered Don Quixote, "Sancho,
help me to my room."

828
01:02:24,289 --> 01:02:29,890
Back in his bed, the old hidalgo slipped into
a sleep that lasted for six days.

829
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,119
The fever he had gotten grew stronger each
day.

830
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,690
He cried and moaned in his sleep, as if being
haunted by nightmares.

831
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:41,510
Meanwhile, his friends waited patiently by
his bedside.

832
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:47,720
After a week, he opened his eyes to see the
priest and the barber sitting at the end of

833
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
his bed.

834
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,060
"I am back," muttered the old knight.

835
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,640
"Don Quixote!"

836
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,849
they shouted, rushing to his side.

837
01:02:56,849 --> 01:03:01,960
"My name is Alonso Quixano," said the man
in the bed.

838
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,440
"I was mad, but now my mind is restored."

839
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,650
"Is it true?

840
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:13,250
Are all your thoughts of chivalry and wizards
really gone from your head?" asked the priest.

841
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:17,119
"They are all gone," he replied softly.

842
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:25,119
"I am sane enough to know that I am dying."

843
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,900
The news that the hidalgo was on his deathbed
raced around the village.

844
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,670
Sancho came running in from the fields where
he had been at work.

845
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,950
He was shown into the room and knelt down
at his former master's side.

846
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:44,990
"Perhaps you were a little crazy," Sancho
sobbed, "but if you were still a knight, you

847
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,789
would not die."

848
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:53,619
"Your friend who was a knight," replied the
hidalgo, "is no longer here.

849
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,350
You must forget him."

850
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:00,700
"I cannot," sobbed the squire.

851
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,750
Sancho tried to convince his old friend not
to give up the ghost.

852
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,900
But the old hidalgo was overcome with fever.

853
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:15,130
Sancho waited at his bedside for three days
until finally, the old knight slipped away.

854
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:19,549
This was the end of the brave knight, Don
Quixote de La Mancha.

855
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:24,270
In his madness, he accomplished feats that
ordinary men can only dream of.

856
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:30,980
The stories of his amazing adventures have
been told for more than four hundred years.

857
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:34,490
Rest in peace, noble Don Quixote.

858
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:39,030
May the questing be grand and the adventures
bring you glory...
