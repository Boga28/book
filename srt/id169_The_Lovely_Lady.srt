1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,480
Pauline Attenborough was seventy-two 
years old, but she looked much younger.  

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,960
When a soft light shone on her, she could look as 
young as thirty. She had a lovely figure and face,  

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,440
and her nose was a very good shape. Only 
her big grey eyes made her look older.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,840
Pauline had left her husband, Ronald, many 
years ago. Pauline and Ronald had had two sons,  

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
Henry and Robert. Henry, the older 
son, had died when Robert was only ten.  

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,840
Now Robert was thirty-two. He lived with 
his mother and worked as a lawyer in London.  

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
Robert Attenborough did not earn very much money,  

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,400
but this was not a problem. 
His mother was a rich woman.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,480
Pauline's niece, Ciss, also lived in the house. 
Her father, Ronald Attenborough's brother,  

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
had died five years ago. Ciss 
had no money or home of her own.  

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,840
She needed a place to live. So 
she depended on her Aunt Pauline.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,800
Ciss was a big young woman, with 
dark hair and eyes. She was very shy.  

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,720
She was in love with her cousin, Robert, 
but she had never told him this. Robert was  

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,560
also very shy. He had no confidence in himself.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,720
Pauline, Robert and Ciss lived 
together quietly, in a lovely house  

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,480
about twenty-five miles from London. The 
house was surrounded by pleasant gardens.  

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,080
It was the perfect house and the perfect life for 
Pauline. Every day, Robert went to work in London.  

18
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Then when he came home, the three of them - 
Pauline, Robert and Ciss - ate dinner together.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,160
During dinner, there were always candles 
on the table. Pauline liked candles because  

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,200
the soft candlelight made her look 
young and beautiful. The soft light  

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,760
shone on the skin of her bare arms and the 
soft material of her dress. Pauline shone  

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,840
with happiness. She looked like a beautiful 
woman of only thirty-two or thirty-three.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,080
After dinner, they had coffee 
in the warm drawing room.  

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,680
The room was full of lovely furniture. For 
many years, Pauline had collected furniture  

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,680
and beautiful, unusual pictures 
from many different countries.  

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,040
She had sold these things to museums for a 
lot of money. This had made her a rich woman.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,800
Pauline, Robert and Ciss chatted together 
pleasantly. Their conversation was always  

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,280
simple and bright. Then at half-past eight, Ciss 
carried the tray of coffee things out of the room.  

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Robert always stayed and 
continued chatting to his mother.  

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
He always listened to everything that she said.

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,920
At the side of the house, there was a large 
courtyard. Ciss had a flat just across the  

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,760
courtyard, above the old coach house and 
stables. Several years ago, a carriage  

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,120
and horses had been kept in these buildings. 
Now Robert kept his car in the coach-house.

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,680
Ciss did not always go to her flat after dinner. 
In summer, she sometimes sat outside in the  

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,800
large garden. She listened to Pauline's 
laughter coming from the drawing room.  

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,600
In winter, Ciss put on a thick coat and walked 
through the garden and down to the little  

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,160
bridge over the stream. She liked to hear the 
water running under the bridge. She would look  

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,920
back at the lighted windows of the drawing room, 
where Pauline and Robert were so happy together.

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Ciss loved Robert. 'I believe that Pauline 
wants Robert to marry me when she dies,'  

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:15,280
she thought. 'But Robert is very shy. Perhaps his 
mother won't die for many years. By that time,  

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,680
it will be too late. Robert will be just 
an empty man who never enjoyed his life.'

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Sometimes Ciss stayed in the dark garden until 
about ten o'clock, when she saw the light go on  

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,400
in Pauline's bedroom. Robert usually stayed in the 
drawing room for another hour, then he would go to  

44
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:46,080
bed too. Ciss, standing in the garden, wanted to 
go to him. She wanted to say, 'Oh, Robert! This is  

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:56,000
all wrong!' But she could not do this because Aunt 
Pauline would hear. So she went to her own rooms.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
In the mornings, Robert went to 
London at about nine o'clock.  

47
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,920
Pauline rested in bed. She 
came downstairs at lunchtime.  

48
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Sometimes she did not leave her bedroom until 
teatime. But she always looked fresh and young.

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,640
Pauline always had a rest in the afternoons. When 
the sun shone, she liked to lie outside and bathe  

50
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,480
in the warm sun. Behind the stables, 
there was a second, smaller courtyard,  

51
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,320
which was surrounded by trees. The sun 
shone right down into this little courtyard,  

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:39,040
so it was a perfect place for sunbathing. Here, 
Ciss put a chair for Pauline to lie on, a large  

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,160
umbrella and blankets. If the sun became too hot, 
Pauline could lie in the shade of the umbrella.

54
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,560
One afternoon, Ciss decided to sunbathe 
too. She found a ladder and climbed up  

55
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,760
onto the flat roof of the stables. Then she lay 
down on a blanket in one corner of the roof.  

56
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,120
The sun shone brightly here and it was 
very hot. Ciss was above Aunt Pauline,  

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,680
who lay in the little courtyard below. But Pauline 
did not know that Ciss was on the roof above her.

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,840
It was lovely, lying in the warm sun and air.  

59
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,040
The warmth of the sun on her legs 
and arms made Ciss feel comfortable  

60
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:32,240
and relaxed. Suddenly she heard a voice speaking 
softly and her heart jumped with fear and shock.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,760
'No, Henry dear!' said the voice. 'It was not my 
fault that you died instead of marrying Claudia.'

62
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,280
The voice did not sound human. Where was it coming 
from? There must be someone on the roof! Ciss  

63
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
lifted her head and looked around. But 
there was nobody on the roof with her.

64
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,280
Suddenly she heard the soft voice again.

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,400
'No, darling! I said that you would be tired of 
her in six months! I warned you, and it was true.  

66
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
I couldn't do anything more. And you 
died without ever knowing me again.'

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,480
The voice was silent. Ciss lay on her blanket. 
It was a beautiful summer afternoon. Did the  

68
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,480
voice belong to a ghost? Ciss hated 
the idea of ghosts, spirits and magic.

69
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
Then she heard a deep sigh and 
the strange voice spoke again.

70
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:46,240
'Ah, well, a heart must feel pain! 
But it wasn't my fault, dear.  

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,400
It is better for a heart to feel pain, 
rather than break from sorrow. And Robert  

72
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,120
could marry poor, boring Ciss tomorrow, if 
he wanted to. But he doesn't care about her.'

73
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,240
Ciss sat up quickly. She was very surprised. It 
was Aunt Pauline talking! It must be Aunt Pauline!  

74
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Where was she? And how was Ciss hearing her 
strange whispers? Aunt Pauline must be lying  

75
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,280
right below her. And she must be using a trick 
to make her voice sound strange. Aunt Pauline  

76
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,600
was trying to frighten her! Ciss was still 
afraid, but she was now thinking more clearly.

77
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,320
Ciss lay down again. She knew the story of Henry, 
Robert's older brother. Henry had been in love  

78
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,960
with Claudia, a beautiful young actress. But his 
mother had been against Claudia and had laughed  

79
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:54,840
at Henry. Henry had become ill with a brain 
disease and died at the age of twenty two.

80
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
'I think that I should get up 
now,' the voice was saying.  

81
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:08,160
'I've had enough sun. A woman might live forever 
if she has enough sun, love and good food.  

82
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,680
I truly believe a good life 
will make me live forever.'

83
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,280
'That is certainly Aunt Pauline's 
voice,' Ciss said to herself.  

84
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,840
'How horrible! I'm hearing 
Aunt Pauline's thoughts.'

85
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,720
Ciss turned and looked down in front of her. 
She was staring at a hole in the corner of  

86
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,680
the roof. The lead gutter, the pipe for taking 
away the rainwater, went down into this hole.  

87
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
The water then came out of the 
rain pipe, near the ground.  

88
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,840
Suddenly a sigh and a 
whisper came out of the hole.

89
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,080
'Ah well, Pauline! Get up. 
You've had enough sun today.'

90
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,320
Now Ciss understood. Aunt Pauline was 
lying below her and the rain pipe was  

91
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,440
carrying her voice up to the roof! Aunt 
Pauline was speaking her thoughts aloud.  

92
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,280
She did not know that the sound of 
her voice was going up to the roof.

93
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
So Aunt Pauline was feeling 
guilty about Henry's death.  

94
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,640
He had died and she thought that it was her fault. 
Ciss believed that Pauline had loved her big,  

95
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
handsome son Henry, more than she 
loved Robert. Henry's death had been  

96
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,600
a terrible shock for Pauline. She only 
loved Robert because Henry was dead.

97
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,000
Ciss put on her clothes, picked up her 
blanket, and carefully climbed down the ladder.  

98
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
As she went down, she heard her aunt calling,  

99
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,680
'All right, Ciss!' The lovely lady had finished 
sunbathing. She was returning to the house.

100
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,720
Ciss went into the small courtyard. She 
picked up Pauline's blankets and the chair  

101
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,360
and put them in the house. Then she 
looked for the opening of the rain pipe.  

102
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,760
She found it in the corner of 
two walls of the stable building.  

103
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,040
The mouth of the rain pipe was almost 
hidden by the leaves of a plant on the wall.  

104
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
When Pauline sat in her chair and turned her 
face to the wall, her mouth would be near to  

105
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,600
the rain pipe. Ciss had heard her aunt's voice. 
No ghosts, spirits, or magic had made the voice.

106
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,800
That evening, after they had drunk 
their coffee, Pauline stood up.  

107
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:45,440
'The sun has made me so sleepy today,' she said. 
'I shall go to bed now. You two sit and chat.'

108
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,880
When Pauline had gone to bed, 
Ciss turned towards Robert.  

109
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,840
'Do you remember your brother, 
Henry?' she asked him.

110
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Robert looked at her in surprise. 
'Yes, very well,' he said.

111
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
'What was he like?' asked Ciss.

112
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,840
'Tall and handsome, with 
soft brown hair like mother,'  

113
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,600
Robert said. 'Women liked him. 
Henry was very happy and clever.'

114
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
'Did he love your mother?'

115
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,520
'Very much,' Robert said. 'She loved 
him too - more than she loves me.'

116
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,880
'Robert,' Ciss said. 'Do you like me?'

117
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,400
Ciss saw Robert's face become pale.

118
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,800
'Yes,' Robert said. 'I like you very much.'

119
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,200
'Will you kiss me? Nobody 
ever kisses me,' Ciss said.

120
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,840
Robert looked at his cousin with 
fear in his eyes. Then he stood up  

121
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,480
and kissed her gently on the cheek. Ciss held 
Robert's hand and pressed it against her breast.

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,640
'Come and sit with me in the garden,' she said.

123
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,320
'But what about mother?' he 
said. He was nervous and shy.

124
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
Ciss smiled a little and looked into his 
eyes. Suddenly Robert's face became red.  

125
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
A few minutes later, she left 
him and went to her flat.

126
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,200
The sunny weather continued. It was now 
July. Every afternoon, Pauline sunbathed  

127
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,000
in the small courtyard. And Ciss lay on 
the roof above the stables, listening.  

128
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
But the sound of Pauline's voice 
did not come up the pipe again.

129
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,200
After dinner in the evenings, 
Ciss waited in the garden.  

130
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,320
She saw the light go on in her aunt's bedroom. 
She saw the lights go out in the drawing room.  

131
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,520
She waited, but Robert did not come 
into the garden. Then one night,  

132
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,920
he came out and walked towards her. Ciss stood 
up and walked softly over the grass to him.

133
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,840
'Don't speak,' Robert whispered.

134
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,840
They stood together, looking up 
at the stars in the dark sky.

135
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,160
'How can I ask you to love me?' 
he said. 'And how can I marry?  

136
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,640
I haven't made much money. And I 
can't ask my mother for money.'

137
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,080
'Then don't worry about marrying yet,' 
Ciss said. 'But do love me a little.'

138
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,640
Robert gave a short laugh. 
'It's hard to begin,' he said.

139
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,040
They sat down and he held her hand. At last, 
she said goodnight, stood up, and went indoors.

140
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,520
The next day, Ciss lay on the roof, sunbathing.  

141
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,840
Suddenly she heard her aunt's voice 
from the hole in the lead gutter.

142
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,280
First Pauline spoke in Italian, 
then she spoke in English.

143
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,160
'No, Robert dear,' said Pauline's voice. 'You 
will never be the same kind of man as your  

144
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:22,960
father. But you look like him. Mauro was a 
wonderful lover. Mauro! Mauro! How you loved me!'

145
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:33,680
The voice stopped speaking. Ciss realized 
that her aunt had a secret. Pauline's husband,  

146
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,760
Ronald, had not been Robert's father! Robert's 
father had been an Italian man called Mauro.

147
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,080
'I'm disappointed with you, Robert,'  

148
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,840
continued Pauline's voice. 'Your father was a 
priest, but he was the best lover in the world.  

149
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,080
You are like a cold fish. And Ciss is 
like a cat who is trying to catch you.'

150
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:09,280
Ciss suddenly put her mouth near the hole 
in the rain pipe and spoke. 'Leave Robert  

151
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,440
alone!' she said in a deep 
voice. 'Don't kill him too.'

152
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,280
There was a silence. The hot afternoon 
sun shone on the flat roof of the stables.  

153
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,120
Ciss listened, with her heart beating quickly.  

154
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:36,240
At last, she heard her aunt Pauline 
whisper the words, 'Did someone speak?'

155
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,040
Ciss spoke again into the hole of the lead gutter.

156
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:49,840
'You killed me,' she said in a deep, 
terrible voice. 'Don't kill Robert too!'

157
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,240
'Ah!' said Pauline, giving a 
little cry. 'Who's speaking?'

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
'Henry!' said Ciss in the same, deep voice.

159
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,320
There was silence again.

160
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,040
'I didn't kill you, Henry,' said Pauline.  

161
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:18,160
'No! No! Henry, it wasn't my fault. I loved 
you, my dearest boy. I only wanted to help you.'

162
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:32,240
'You killed me!' Ciss said in the deep voice. 
Now, let Robert live. Let him go! Let him marry!'

163
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,280
'Henry!' said Pauline. Are you a ghost? 
Have you come to punish me for your death?'

164
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:51,040
'YES! I HAVE COME TO PUNISH YOU!' said 
Ciss in a terrible, frightening voice.

165
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,880
She was very angry with Pauline. She felt that 
her anger was going down the rain pipe to her  

166
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,160
aunt. At the same time, she almost laughed. 
This was a very funny conversation!

167
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,680
Ciss lay and listened. No sound came from the 
rain pipe. The afternoon had become cooler.  

168
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,680
Yellow and grey clouds had covered the sun. 
There was a roar of thunder. A storm was coming.  

169
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,440
Ciss dressed quickly, went down the ladder, 
and ran to the corner of the stables.

170
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,520
'Aunt Pauline!' she called. 
'Did you hear thunder?'

171
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,960
'Y-yes! I am going indoors,' her aunt 
replied in a weak voice. 'Don't wait for me.'

172
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
Ciss watched her aunt go inside the house.  

173
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,240
The sky was growing darker. Ciss took the 
blankets and the chair and hurried inside.

174
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Then the storm began. Pauline did not come 
downstairs to tea because she did not like  

175
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:10,240
thunder. Robert did not arrive home until after 
tea. By this time, the rain was pouring down.

176
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,640
Ciss went to her flat and got ready for dinner. 
She put on a pretty white dress and fastened some  

177
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,480
white flowers at her breast. When she went 
into the drawing room, Robert was waiting.  

178
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,520
He was standing by the drawing-room 
window and listening to the rain falling.  

179
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,440
He now had a different look 
on his face as he watched her.

180
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,200
The drawing room was lit by the soft light of a 
table lamp. Ciss walked towards the bookshelves  

181
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,000
near the door. When she heard the door opening 
softly, Ciss suddenly turned on the switch of  

182
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,320
the ceiling light. Her aunt, wearing a black 
dress, stood in the doorway. The strong, hard  

183
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,880
light showed her face clearly. Pauline was wearing 
make-up, but her face looked old and full of hate.

184
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,160
'Oh, aunt!' cried Ciss.

185
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,320
'Mother, you look like a little old 
lady!' said Robert in a shocked voice.

186
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,280
'Aren't we going to eat 
dinner?' asked Pauline angrily.

187
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,160
Pauline sat at the table, getting angrier and 
angrier. She looked very, very old and very ugly.

188
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,840
Ciss and Robert watched each other. He was very 
shocked by his mother's face. Pauline ate her  

189
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,240
dinner quickly, like a hungry dog. As soon as they 
had finished eating, she ran towards the stairs.  

190
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,840
Robert and Ciss followed her from the room.

191
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,680
'You pour the coffee. I hate it,' said the old 
woman quickly. 'I'm going to bed! Goodnight!'

192
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,920
There was silence.  

193
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,640
At last, Robert said, 'I'm afraid that 
mother isn't well. She must see a doctor.'

194
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
'Yes,' said Ciss.

195
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
The rest of the evening passed in silence.  

196
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,040
Robert and Ciss stayed in the drawing room. A 
fire was lit. Outside, cold rain was falling.

197
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,800
At about ten o'clock, the door opened 
and Pauline came into the room.  

198
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,400
She shut the door and came to the fire. Then she 
looked at Robert and Ciss with hate in her eyes.

199
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,840
'You two should get married quickly,' she said 
in an ugly voice. 'You are so much in love.'

200
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,640
Robert looked up at his mother. 'You 
believed that cousins should not marry,  

201
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Mother,' he said quietly. 
'You told me that often.'

202
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,640
'I do believe that cousins shouldn't marry,' 
replied Pauline. 'But you're not cousins.  

203
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
Your father was an Italian priest, Robert.  

204
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,840
He was a great man. And he was too 
great to have a weak son like you.'

205
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
With a terrible look on her 
face, Pauline left the room.

206
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Pauline had gone mad. Her madness continued 
for a week. The doctor came and told her that  

207
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:33,040
she must sleep. He gave her drugs to help her. 
But she did not take the medicine. She walked  

208
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,840
about her room, looking ugly and full of hate. 
She would not look at either Robert or Ciss.

209
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,600
At first, Ciss was frightened by what she 
had done. She realized that her trick had  

210
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,840
made her aunt mad. Ciss almost felt sorry 
for the terrible thing that she had done.

211
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,160
Then she thought, 'This woman is the real 
Pauline. We never saw her true character before.'

212
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But Pauline was not going to live 
long. She stayed in her room, and did  

213
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,160
not see anyone. She had her mirrors taken 
away. She did not want to look at herself.

214
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
Robert and Ciss spent a lot of time together.  

215
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,040
But Ciss could not tell Robert 
what she had done. She was afraid.

216
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,520
'Do you think that your mother ever loved 
anybody?' Ciss asked him one evening.

217
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,240
'Mother only loved herself!' 
Robert said. 'And she loved power.  

218
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,040
She got her power by controlling other people's 
lives. She was beautiful, and she grew strong  

219
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,840
by controlling everyone and everything. She 
destroyed Henry and she was destroying me.'

220
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
'And don't you forgive her?' asked Ciss.

221
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,600
'No, I don't. She took other people's 
hopes and happiness and destroyed them.'

222
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,920
Two days later, Pauline died.

223
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,160
Ciss found her dead, in her bed. Pauline's 
heart had become weak, and the drugs that she  

224
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:21,360
took were too strong for her. But after her death, 
Pauline got her revenge on her son and her niece.

225
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:31,120
Pauline Attenborough was a very rich woman, but 
she left Robert only one thousand pounds. And  

226
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,520
she left Ciss only one hundred pounds. 
The rest of her money went to a museum.  

227
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,840
She had built a museum and given it her own 
name - the Pauline Attenborough Museum.
 
 
 
 

228
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,403
- THE END -
