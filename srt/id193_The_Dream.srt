1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,729
Even if dreams can show us the future, this
dream did not make sense.

2
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:11,040
Must I never pass a lorry on a clear road?

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,920
Can a dream show us the future and give us
the opportunity of changing it?

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,510
It is hard to believe.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,460
If we can see the future in a dream, then
surely the future already exists.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,659
If it does, then we are not free to act in
the ways we wish to, we are not responsible

7
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,179
for our own lives.

8
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:42,789
Before I tell you the dream, I must explain
a little about the context.

9
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,819
It was the summer of four years ago, and I
was driving my family back from Italy through

10
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:49,749
the south of France.

11
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:56,609
My son had not yet learned to drive, my daughter
was too young, and my wife doesn't drive at

12
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:57,609
all.

13
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,769
I had been at the wheel for the best part
of three weeks.

14
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:08,260
Perhaps I was tired; perhaps I could think
of nothing except cars.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:14,830
We spent the night of the dream in a town
called Tain l'Hermitage.

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,000
Now I'll tell you the dream.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,460
I was sitting in a big, powerful, cream-coloured
car, and I was driving at high speed through

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,500
the country.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,920
I was coming to a bend in the road, and in
front of me, there was a very large lorry.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,390
My foot reached out towards the brake, but
it could not find it.

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,370
I looked down: there was no brake!

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,520
Worse: my hands held empty air.

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,630
There was no wheel for them to hold.

24
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,410
There were no controls of any kind.

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,360
Already we were almost into the back of the
lorry.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,640
I shouted in fear.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,420
Then I heard a calm voice coming from my left,
and I turned my head.

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,020
A stranger was sitting there.

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,030
He was a cheerful man of about forty.

30
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,840
He was wearing an expensive shirt, and on
his head, he had a red hat.

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,510
I couldn't understand what he said; he spoke
very quickly in French, and my own French

32
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,730
is not very good.

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,280
I didn't, in fact, care what he said.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,209
My eyes were on his clean, fat hands, which
were holding the wheel.

35
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,090
This car had its wheel on the left.

36
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,060
He, not I, was in control.

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,709
We drove safely round the bend.

38
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,939
He turned the wheel slightly to place the
car in the middle of the road.

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,069
He was going to pass the lorry.

40
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,290
The road stretched straight ahead.

41
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,799
It was bright in the sunlight and it was quite
empty.

42
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,870
Only one other person was in sight; a woman
was sitting outside a small house with white

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,230
walls, and this house was almost exactly ahead
of us.

44
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,670
She was sitting by a table putting some flowers
in pots.

45
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,849
She wanted to sell us some, and waved them
at us.

46
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:28,860
This sight, for some reason, filled me with
a terrible fear.

47
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,400
The flowers made me think of death and our
final resting place.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,079
At this moment, we were level with the lorry
and ready to pass it, but then the lorry began

49
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,279
to turn away from the side of the road, towards
our car.

50
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:50,829
It appeared that the driver was doing this
on purpose.

51
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,409
The stranger by my side shouted loudly and
tried to move out of the way.

52
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,650
There was a terrible noise from the back of
the car, and then an explosion.

53
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,790
The earth seemed to turn over, and the noise
of flames burned in my ears.

54
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,230
At that point, I woke up in fear.

55
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,940
I was very worried by this dream, and could
not sleep again.

56
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,340
It seemed to have a message, and I wanted
to explain it.

57
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,840
Even if dreams can show us the future, this
dream did not make sense.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,090
Must I never pass a lorry on a clear road?

59
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,910
The road to Paris is always filled with very
large lorries.

60
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,440
Most of them come up from Marseilles, and
I always have to pass them when the road is

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,650
clear; I can't drive slowly behind them forever.

62
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,150
No, this was not the meaning of the dream.

63
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,380
At its heart was some kind of fear.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:04,820
I had to recognize my fear, and then I could
forget all about it.

65
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,820
I thought about my driving during the last
three weeks.

66
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,160
I tried to remember all the lorries and all
the small white houses.

67
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,880
I thought of all the cars, which were painted
cream.

68
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,970
I remembered nothing of any great interest.

69
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,670
I had imagined that the road in the dream
must be in France; it was long, empty and

70
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,870
straight.

71
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,440
But then I remembered that we had passed the
lorry on the right.

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,590
So the dream was about a road in England;
in England all cars keep to the left.

73
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,770
Immediately, I remembered something.

74
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,430
Two years before this, I was travelling in
the north of England.

75
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,890
An American and I were making some radio programmes.

76
00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:00,300
He had brought his car from America, and of
course, the driver sat on the left side.

77
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,590
The brakes and other controls were also on
the left, but the colour of his car was not

78
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,610
cream.

79
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,580
The American was a careless driver, and often
passed other cars against my advice.

80
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,440
Remember that I was in a better position to
see: I was sitting on the right.

81
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,910
Once, just after Nottingham, he played chicken'.

82
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,880
You probably know about 'chicken'; it is a
game that is played on the roads.

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,320
It is becoming more and more popular in America,
because long journeys are often very dull.

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,400
You just move your car into the middle of
the road and stay there.

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,850
When another car appears, it comes towards
you in the middle of the road.

86
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,740
The driver who turns away is the chicken.

87
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,810
Quite often, neither driver turns away.

88
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,950
I expressed my displeasure at this game in
language that the American could not fail

89
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,080
to understand.

90
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,860
We did not play it again, but it had probably
left its mark on my mind.

91
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,680
So then, when I was asleep, I experienced
it all again in a dream.

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,550
I also remembered something else while I was
having breakfast.

93
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,190
When we played 'chicken', it was an uncommonly
windy day.

94
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,370
We stopped at Chesterfield, and the American
bought a hat.

95
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,950
It was a black hat, not a red one, but in
dreams, details are not always exact.

96
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,900
After this, I forgot about the dream until
the afternoon.

97
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,680
The big French lorries often play their own
game.

98
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,960
They stay in the middle of the road, and you
can't pass them.

99
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,340
You have to stay behind them.

100
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,300
Sometimes you have to follow them for endless
kilometres, although the roads are almost

101
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,320
completely empty.

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,220
This afternoon we were following a large vehicle,
which was making terrible noises.

103
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:07,210
When I blew my horn, the driver moved to the
side of the road, but it was the wrong side.

104
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,160
He was driving along on the left, instead
of keeping to the right.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,420
There was enough space on the right for me
to pass him.

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,020
But to do that would be wrong.

107
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:24,050
So I just followed him for a few kilometres
and I told myself not to pass him.

108
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,540
I considered the situation from every point
of view.

109
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,380
I could certainly turn my car more quickly
than he could turn his lorry.

110
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,580
It was a very big, heavy lorry.

111
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,180
Could I, perhaps, pass him quickly on the
right before he could do anything?

112
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,930
If he turned to the right, though, he could
easily kill us all.

113
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,680
He probably wanted a bit of fun, but he might
want an accident.

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,110
If he killed us, nobody would say it was his
fault; the law would be on his side.

115
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,700
The road ahead was quite empty, and went on
for many kilometres.

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,040
I drove more slowly until some distance separated
us.

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,090
Then I increased my speed as much as I could.

118
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,450
I drove towards that empty space beside the
lorry.

119
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,750
My car was moving at about 110 kilometres
an hour.

120
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,580
The front of my car was almost level with
the back of the lorry.

121
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,940
Then I saw something that knocked the breath
out of my body.

122
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,790
On the grass beside the road, a woman was
sitting outside a small white house with a

123
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,530
table of flowers!

124
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,690
For the first time in my life, I changed my
mind while I was preparing to pass another

125
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,920
vehicle.

126
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,090
My foot went down hard on the brake.

127
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,330
The car rocked from side to side.

128
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,480
From behind me, I heard the sound of a horn.

129
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,900
Another car was following us at a high speed.

130
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,140
I knew its colour before I saw it; it was
cream.

131
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,550
I pressed hard on the brake and turned the
wheel slightly.

132
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,130
I was just able to move in behind the lorry
without touching it.

133
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,490
The other car passed us and the driver blew
his horn wildly.

134
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,060
It reached the lorry - and then the lorry
turned towards it.

135
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,900
For a moment I thought that the car was going
to pass the lorry safely; it was moving very

136
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,430
fast.

137
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,820
Then the front of the lorry just touched the
back of the car.

138
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,050
It was only a light touch, but it knocked
the car towards the side of the road and the

139
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,390
woman at the table.

140
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,990
The driver of that car knew exactly what to
do.

141
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,230
With the greatest skill, he turned it back
into the middle of the road.

142
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,650
His control was wonderful, much better than
mine.

143
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,760
He waved angrily at the lorry driver and drove
quickly away in a cloud of dust.

144
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,440
He was soon out of sight.

145
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,120
We stayed that night in Fontainebleau.

146
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,010
A big car was standing outside the hotel,
and the back showed signs of damage to the

147
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
paintwork.

148
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,410
It was a cream car, and so I looked for the
driver.

149
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,360
He was not wearing a red hat or an expensive
shirt.

150
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,050
He was a young man from Paris - not like the
driver in my dream.

151
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,230
He spoke good English, so I asked him if he
would like the number of that lorry.

152
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,760
I had noticed it, and I was happy to give
it to him.

153
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,520
But he only laughed; the law won't help you
if you pass on the wrong side of the road.

154
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,770
To him the whole thing had been a game.

155
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,730
'It tests your skill,' he said.

156
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,950
'If the car is powerful enough, you can do
it.

157
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,560
But you couldn't do it, not in your car.'

158
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,149
I didn't tell him about my dream, my reason
for not passing the lorry.

159
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:21,550
There was no time; he was in a hurry and wanted
to reach Paris quickly.

160
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,150
It made me think, though.

161
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't really believe in dreams, of course;
but something saved us all from a terrible

162
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
