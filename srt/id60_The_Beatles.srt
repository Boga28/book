00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:09,200
The End of a Dream
Paul McCartney once said, The Beatles were

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,769
always a great little band - nothing more,
nothing less.'

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,890
Millions of fans around the world disagree
with this.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:26,380
To them, the Beatles were a 'great little
band' who changed modern music forever.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,320
When the Beatles ended in 1970, people around
the world couldn't believe it.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,379
John, Paul, George and Ringo all followed
their own interests successfully.

7
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:53,210
But all four faced the same question everywhere
they went: 'When will you play together again?'

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:02,020
The answer always seemed the same - never
- but fans could hope and dream.

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:10,060
Then, on 8 December 1980, the dream ended.

10
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,860
John Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning home
to their building in New York.

11
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,270
Mark Chapman was waiting in the shadows.

12
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,980
He shouted to John and then he shot the singer
in the back and chest.

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,540
John Lennon died in hospital that night.

14
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,770
The news was met with sadness all around the
world.

15
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:47,380
The Beatles could never play together again.

16
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,020
Early Days
The four boys from Liverpool were all born

17
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,280
during the Second World War.

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,530
Life in the northern city wasn't always easy
after the war.

19
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,070
Most people lived in small houses and many
were poor.

20
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,170
But like many ports, Liverpool was open to
new ideas.

21
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,280
Sometimes ships brought something that other
places in Britain couldn't get - rock and

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,980
roll records from the US!

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,780
For the young people of Liverpool in the 1950s,
the exciting sound of rock and roll was an

24
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,210
escape from their daily lives.

25
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:44,030
Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr) was born in
1940 and grew up in one of Liverpool's poorest

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,880
areas.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,760
He was often ill, and he first played drums
in hospital.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,870
He bought his first drum around 1956 - just
one big drum!

29
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,530
He played with a few local bands.

30
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,239
Then he joined Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.

31
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,410
Around this time, Richard took a new name
- 'Ringo' - because of all the rings on his

32
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,270
hands.

33
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,900
George Harrison, the youngest Beatle, was
born in 1943.

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,890
His father was a bus driver, but before that
he worked on ships.

35
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,209
George loved his father's records from the
US.

36
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,450
At school, he sat in class drawing pictures
of guitars.

37
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:48,010
When he did get his guitar, he practiced all
the time.

38
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,760
Paul McCartney was born in 1942, the son of
a nurse and a cotton salesman.

39
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,960
The family loved music.

40
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,120
When Paul was old enough, his father bought
him a trumpet.

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,140
But Paul couldn't play the trumpet and sing
at the same time.

42
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,450
So he changed the trumpet for a guitar.

43
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:21,839
He sometimes talked about music with a younger
boy at his school - George Harrison.

44
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,849
John Lennon was born in 1940.

45
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:32,169
After his father left, his mother sent the
four-year-old boy to his Aunt Mimi and her

46
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,210
husband's big house in a pleasant part of
Liverpool.

47
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,719
John loved rock and roll.

48
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,310
He remembered seeing an Elvis Presley film.

49
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,389
When the audience screamed, he thought, 'That's
a good job!'

50
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,699
John's mother loved music too - and she taught
her son well.

51
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,349
He started a band, the Quarry Men.

52
00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:02,479
The name came from his school, Quarry Bank.

53
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:10,410
One afternoon in July 1957, a friend took
Paul to see the Quarry Men at a church garden

54
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,330
party.

55
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,639
John was singing, but he couldn't remember
all the words.

56
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,990
This didn't stop him - he sang new words.

57
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,270
After the concert, Paul played a song on his
guitar for John.

58
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,300
Years later, John remembered the meeting.

59
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,949
Paul was better than the people in the band,
but John was a little worried.

60
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:44,059
What was more important: his own strong position
in the group, or a stronger group?

61
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,460
He chose the group.

62
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,139
Lennon and McCartney were together.

63
00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:01,759
From Liverpool to Hamburg
One day, Paul showed John one of his own songs.

64
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,930
After that, John began to write his own musical
ideas, and soon the two young men were writing

65
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,559
song after song.

66
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:16,029
Sometimes they worked together, sometimes
alone.

67
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:21,860
But each of them pushed himself harder because
of the other one.

68
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,529
This was true during all the Beatles years.

69
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:33,509
Not long after Paul joined, he told John about
his friend George.

70
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,899
John wasn't sure - George was only fifteen.

71
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,229
But George joined after John heard him play.

72
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:47,559
They were on the top of a bus at the time!

73
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:54,639
Soon John, Paul and George were playing concerts
in Liverpool, but there was a problem.

74
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,089
They didn't have a drummer or a bass guitarist.

75
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:06,719
One of John's art-school friends, Stu Sutcliffe,
looked like James Dean and he was an artist.

76
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:13,379
When he sold a painting, the boys in the band
asked him to buy a bass guitar.

77
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:20,659
Stu wanted to be in a band, but there was
one small problem: he couldn't play.

78
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,979
Stu often turned his back to the crowds in
concerts because of this!

79
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,020
What's in a name?

80
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:37,229
John and Stu probably thought of the name
'the Beatles', but there are other stories.

81
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:43,319
John wrote that, at twelve years old, he was
told the name by a little man.

82
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,740
There was a more serious story, too: they
heard it in a Marlon Brando film, The Wild

83
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,220
One.

84
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,419
But many years later, Paul McCartney named
a 1997 album Flaming Pie, for the place where

85
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,779
John saw his little man!

86
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,569
People were starting to like the band.

87
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,330
The Beatles got a job playing with a rock
and roll singer, Johnny Gentle.

88
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,270
They toured Scotland under the name the Silver
Beetles.

89
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,699
For a time, Paul played drums because they
couldn't find a drummer.

90
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,789
Then, back in Liverpool, they were offered
another job.

91
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:34,680
Bands were needed to play in clubs in the
German city of Hamburg.

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,590
The band said yes - but first they needed
a drummer.

93
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:48,510
They asked Pete Best, the drummer in another
local band (and the owner of some nice drums!).

94
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:56,030
Pete agreed and the band travelled to Germany
in the summer of 1960.

95
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:05,690
To five boys from Liverpool, Hamburg was another
world - a world of all-night bars and street

96
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,080
crime.

97
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,890
Concerts weren't always easy.

98
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,030
On some nights, John had to push people off
the stage.

99
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:23,710
To keep audiences happy, bands had to play
well for six or seven hours every night.

100
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,710
With all this practice, the band became better
and better.

101
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:37,661
Another of the Liverpool bands in Hamburg
was called Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.

102
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,520
The band was famous in Liverpool.

103
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,010
The band's drummer loved to come and watch
the Beatles.

104
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,040
Sometimes, when Pete Best was ill, he even
played with the band.

105
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,510
His name was Ringo Starr.

106
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,090
The first trip to Hamburg ended suddenly.

107
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:05,190
George was sent home by the police because
he was too young to play in the clubs - he

108
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,220
was only seventeen.

109
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,710
But the Beatles returned often to Hamburg.

110
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:19,010
Each time they played to bigger crowds in
better clubs.

111
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,910
In The Cavern
On their second trip to Hamburg, a record

112
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,650
producer asked the Beatles to play on a record
for the singer Tony Sheridan.

113
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:39,530
The song was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean'
and they played as the Beat Brothers.

114
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,410
The boys were becoming successful.

115
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,190
But one of the band decided that he didn't
want to be a Beatle.

116
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,320
Stu met a young photographer, Astrid Kirchherr,
in Hamburg.

117
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,340
Her photos of the band later became famous.

118
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,680
She also helped the band's look.

119
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,320
One day, she cut Stu's hair.

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,220
At first, the others in the band laughed - they
all pushed their hair back off their faces

121
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,320
like rock and roll singers.

122
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,440
But later John, Paul and George all had the
same haircut.

123
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,840
After the band's second trip to Hamburg, Stu
decided to stay there.

124
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:36,390
He was in love with Astrid and he wanted to
study art in Hamburg.

125
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:43,000
Paul never had a high opinion of Stu's playing,
and he started to play the bass.

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,300
Back in Liverpool, people were interested
in the new band 'from Hamburg'.

127
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,100
At first, someone told John, 'You speak good
English.'

128
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,800
But the band became more and more popular
in their home city.

129
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,630
They often played at a club called The Cavern.

130
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:11,150
Hundreds of fans crowded into the small, dark
club when the Beatles played there.

131
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:17,870
The band was famous now in Liverpool, but
was that enough?

132
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,430
Everything changed when they met Brian Epstein.

133
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,190
He was the manager of a big music shop in
the city.

134
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,810
When he heard about the Beatles, he went to
The Cavern.

135
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,270
In his suit and tie, Epstein probably looked
very different from The Cavern's young crowd.

136
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,040
In his opinion, the band were a little rough.

137
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,810
But, he has said.

138
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,980
'I immediately liked what I heard.'

139
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,900
Epstein met the band and offered to become
their manager.

140
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:02,410
When he promised to make an agreement with
a record company, the band said yes!

141
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,850
Brian Epstein immediately gave the band new
rules.

142
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,450
They couldn't eat, drink or smoke on stage.

143
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,340
The four young men started wearing suits.

144
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:25,640
Epstein worked hard for the band and on the
last day of 1962, they drove down to London.

145
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:33,090
They played for Decca, a big record company,
but it didn't go well.

146
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:39,540
Two months later, the company said no to Brian
Epstein and the Beatles.

147
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,170
In their opinion, guitar bands weren't popular
now.

148
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,230
Worse news came from Germany.

149
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,610
Stu was ill with terrible headaches.

150
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:01,290
He died in April 1962, a day before the Beatles'
third trip to Hamburg.

151
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,690
He was only twenty-one.

152
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,970
During the band's third trip to Hamburg, they
received a message from their manager.

153
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,730
Another record company, Parlophone - part
of the big company EMI - wanted to hear them

154
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,190
in the studio.

155
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:26,260
On Their Way!

156
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:36,820
In June 1962, the Beatles were in London again
- this time, at the Abbey Road studios.

157
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,650
George Martin was one of the producers who
was listening to them for the record company.

158
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,850
Martin didn't like their songs much, but he
liked the boys.

159
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,140
After the Beatles finished playing, he showed
them around the studio.

160
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,600
The band were quiet.

161
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,860
'Is there anything you don't like?' asked
Martin.

162
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,029
Finally, George spoke.

163
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:09,840
'Well, I don't like your tie.'

164
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,310
The fifth Beatle?

165
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:20,590
Before the Beatles, the producer George Martin
mainly produced records of funny songs.

166
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,760
But Martin knew a lot about music and about
recording.

167
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,420
Over the years, he helped the Beatles to grow
as musicians.

168
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,180
At first, he was really the boss.

169
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,000
But after a time, the band told him what they
wanted.

170
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,420
A few weeks later, Martin called Brian Epstein.

171
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:51,540
Yes, the band could make a record with him...
but not with Pete Best on drums.

172
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,460
In the producers opinion, Pete wasn't good
enough.

173
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,850
It was a hard decision for the band, but Pete
had to go.

174
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,820
The drummer was angry when Brian Epstein told
him the news.

175
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,300
The next decision was easier.

176
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,290
In Paul's words, they wanted 'the greatest
drummer in Liverpool' - their friend from

177
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,170
Hamburg, Ringo Starr.

178
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,430
Epstein called Ringo on a Wednesday and asked
him to join the band.

179
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,320
By Saturday, Ringo was the new drummer.

180
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,800
Some fans weren't happy about the change.

181
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:44,980
At The Cavern, a few people shouted angrily
and held up signs: 'Pete is Best!'

182
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
The married Beatle

183
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:54,630
Before they went back to London John married
his girlfriend, Cynthia.

184
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,020
Marriage to a Beatle wasn't easy.

185
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,360
John was often away from home.

186
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:09,299
When their son Julian was born in 1963, fans
even ran after John at the hospital.

187
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:17,519
Later, the Beatles didn't want their young
fans to know that one of the band was married.

188
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:25,669
After their first tour of the US, a reporter
asked John, 'Did your wife like the country?'

189
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,289
John joked, 'Who?

190
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,940
Who?'

191
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:39,940
The band recorded their first single, 'Love
Me Do', at Abbey Road in September 1962.

192
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,059
It was one of Paul's songs.

193
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:48,419
Fans wrote to radio stations, asking them
to play the record.

194
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:55,300
By December 1962, the song was quite successful
at number seventeen.

195
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:02,110
The Beatles were on their way!

196
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,409
Beatlemania
It was time to choose a song for the important

197
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,850
second record.

198
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,869
George Martin didn't like any of John and
Paul's songs at the time, so he chose a new

199
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,129
song.

200
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:20,580
The group said no.

201
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,919
They wanted to do one of their songs.

202
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,950
Today many bands write their own songs, but
at the time this was a brave decision for

203
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,649
a new band.

204
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:41,299
Finally, Martin agreed to record one of John's
songs, 'Please Please Me'.

205
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:48,230
At first it was a slow song, but the producer
asked them to play it faster.

206
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,090
After they recorded it, Martin told them,
'You have just recorded your first number

207
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,900
one.'

208
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,759
The Beatles worked hard to make this true.

209
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,990
They drove all over Britain to concerts.

210
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,799
Sometimes they stopped the van to listen to
their own song on the radio.

211
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,570
Once the van was freezing after the front
window broke.

212
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,000
The Beatles lay together in the back to keep
warm!

213
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,200
In March 1963, 'Please Please Me' reached
number one.

214
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,759
George Martin was right.

215
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,129
After that, number one followed number one.

216
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:41,890
Their singles in 1963 were 'From Me to You',
'She Loves You' and 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'.

217
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,429
Suddenly, everybody loved the Beatles.

218
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:53,509
When the band played in concert, police had
to hold back crowds of screaming fans - mainly

219
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,519
girls.

220
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,789
One newspaper thought of a new word to describe
the country's love of the boys from Liverpool

221
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,429
- 'Beatlemania'!

222
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:12,799
Every Beatles single reached number one until
1967.

223
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,159
The band also recorded their first album early
in 1963.

224
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,519
George Martin asked them to come to the studio
and play all the songs from their live show.

225
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,679
They did this... in one long day!

226
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,720
The album Please Please Me was recorded in
about twelve hours.

227
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,850
It went to number one, too.

228
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,970
'America was ours!'

229
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,669
The Beatles were selling millions of records
in Britain.

230
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:56,600
The Sunday Times newspaper compared Lennon
and McCartney with Beethoven.

231
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,450
But many of the group's fans had other things
on their minds.

232
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,570
A lot of young fans dreamt about their favorite
Beatle:

233
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,200
Paul was the sweet, romantic one.

234
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,409
George was the quiet one.

235
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,269
Ringo was the happy, funny one.

236
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:21,210
John was the intelligent one.

237
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,410
He often made jokes, but they weren't always
kind.

238
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,289
Follow the leader

239
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,890
In the very early days, John was the band's
leader.

240
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,980
When the band became successful, his position
wasn't so clear.

241
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,889
Both he and Paul wrote songs and sang for
the band.

242
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:54,250
In front of the cameras, Paul often spoke
for the band, but John usually had the last

243
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,220
word.

244
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,419
To George, John was always the strongest person
in the group.

245
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:10,950
Years after John's death, he said, 'I think
he is still the leader now, probably.'

246
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:17,320
At the beginning of 1964, the Beatles were
the most popular band in Britain.

247
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,659
They were famous in Europe, but they were
still a little nervous about the United States.

248
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:32,950
Many English stars looked for success across
the Atlantic before the Beatles, but failed.

249
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,279
The Beatles' first singles in the US didn't
do very well.

250
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:46,090
But interest grew, and finally 'I Want to
Hold Your Hand' reached number one.

251
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,090
The band flew there in February 1964.

252
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,929
They all knew how important this trip was.

253
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:02,990
In Ringo's words, America was all that they
dreamt about years earlier.

254
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,210
The trip was a big success.

255
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,740
When the band played on TV's The Ed Sullivan
Show, they were watched by an American TV

256
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,489
audience of almost seventy-three million people.

257
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:23,220
It was one of the most important shows in
the history of popular music.

258
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,980
The Beatles played in Washington and Miami,
and went home happy.

259
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,619
As Ringo said, 'America was ours now.'

260
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:38,409
The band were world stars.

261
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:45,740
The Beatles returned to the United States
later in 1964, as part of a big world tour.

262
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,620
This trip was as successful as the last one.

263
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,840
Ringo remembers that 'it was just so much
fun.

264
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,070
As usual, nobody could hear the music at the
concerts because of the screams of the fans.

265
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,770
At this time it wasn't a big problem for the
band, but it became more and more important

266
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,409
later.

267
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:16,390
George's memory of this tour was less happy
than Ringo's.

268
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,860
President Kennedy was killed only a year before,
and George didn't want anyone to shoot one

269
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,179
of the Beatles.

270
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:34,519
Up and Up
After the first American tour, the Beatles

271
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,720
turned to another world - films.

272
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,830
They made A Hard Day's Night in the spring
of 1964.

273
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:51,820
The title of the film and the song of the
same name was something that Ringo said.

274
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,950
The rest of the band often laughed at the
drummer's unusual way of saying things.

275
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,330
The film's writer, Alan Owen, spent a few
days with the band.

276
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,489
The Beatles were funny, and the film showed
this.

277
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:13,350
Owen also understood the band's daily life.

278
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:19,139
For much of the film, they were running away
from screaming fans.

279
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:25,499
The band liked making the film, but George
probably enjoyed it most.

280
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:30,159
He fell in love with one of the actresses,
Patti Boyd.

281
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,360
They were married in 1966.

282
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,559
The black-and-white film was first shown in
London and Liverpool.

283
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,419
It was a big success.

284
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,100
(The album was, too.

285
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,799
This time, all the songs were by Lennon and
McCartney.)

286
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,700
Many people really liked Ringo's acting in
the film.

287
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,609
Some even called him 'the new Charlie Chaplin'.

288
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:05,440
But Ringo remembers that he came straight
from a club for one very funny part.

289
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,559
He says that he wasn't acting much!

290
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,070
John and Paul's musical ideas were growing
all the time.

291
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,179
Each new song was different and exciting.

292
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:23,499
A different sound

293
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:28,859
John and Paul were both big fans of Bob Dylan's
music.

294
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:36,590
The subjects and language in the young American's
songs were always unusual and interesting.

295
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:44,929
The song 'I'm a Loser' on the album Beatles
for Sale, at the end of 1964, sounded a little

296
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:47,580
like a Dylan song.

297
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:55,700
The same was true of the following year's
'You've Got to Hide Your Love Away'.

298
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,580
John even found time to write a book in 1964.

299
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:06,850
John Lennon In His Own Write was full of funny
short stories and pictures.

300
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,450
It didn't have any serious meaning.

301
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,929
In the introduction Paul wrote, 'If it seems
funny, then that's enough.'

302
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,049
John wrote another book the next year.

303
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:27,179
In early 1965, the Beatles made their second
film.

304
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,460
After the success of A Hard Day's Night, there
was more money.

305
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,059
But the band just wanted to travel and have
a good time.

306
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:42,440
'We started saying, "We've never been to the
Bahamas.

307
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,210
Could you write that in?"'

308
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,169
Paul remembers.

309
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,049
As George said later, 'We had fun in those
days.'

310
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:54,120
But John remembered it differently.

311
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,340
This wasn't a happy time for him.

312
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:05,570
'You can't see it but I'm singing "Help!"'
he said.

313
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,320
'Here to stay'
Later in 1965, Paul wrote one of the most

314
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,009
popular songs of all time.

315
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:23,619
Yesterday was a beautiful, sad song about
lost love.

316
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,529
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

317
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,789
The music for Yesterday' came to Paul in a
dream.

318
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,629
He 'just woke up one morning' with the song
in his head.

319
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:39,450
At first, he thought it was an old song.

320
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,889
But none of his friends knew it.

321
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:47,029
The first words to the song were about eggs!

322
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,940
George Martin loved the song immediately.

323
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,830
But, in his opinion, it needed something different.

324
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,389
Paul recorded it without the rest of the band.

325
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:05,929
He played the guitar alone, while a small
group of musicians played strings.

326
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:11,919
The song is one of the band's most famous
- it has been recorded by many different singers

327
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,320
and groups and in many different ways.

328
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,269
Paul was sometimes angry when people called
it their favorite Beatles song.

329
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:31,019
The King and the Queen
In August, the Beatles were back in the United

330
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,269
States.

331
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:38,370
Fifty-six thousand fans saw them at a concert
in New York.

332
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,049
At the time, it was the biggest concert crowd
ever.

333
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:48,620
The concert was exciting, but Ringo's memories
of it weren't good.

334
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:55,149
At times John was joking too much on stage,
in Ringo's opinion.

335
00:29:55,149 --> 00:30:00,779
Also, not many people at the concert really
heard the band.

336
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:07,029
Like most Beatles concerts, the sound of the
crowd was louder than the music.

337
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,080
The Beatles couldn't hear much of the music
either.

338
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,200
So, of course, it was difficult to play well.

339
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,279
'I always wanted to play with good players,'
remembers Ringo.

340
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:27,600
But now the band was playing badly on stage,
and nobody was listening.

341
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,700
On the same tour, the Beatles met one of their
favourite singers - Elvis Presley.

342
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:40,289
'It was one of the great meetings of my life,'
Paul has said.

343
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:44,279
The boys and the 'King' had a good time.

344
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,419
But years later the band discovered that Elvis
was worried about the Beatles' success in

345
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:52,379
his country.

346
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:57,009
He asked the American government to send them
home.

347
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:04,249
Back in Britain, the government gave all the
Beatles the MBE.

348
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:11,899
This award was often given to successful businesspeople
or to people who fought bravely for their

349
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:12,909
country.

350
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:15,530
Many Britons were angry.

351
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,479
How could the government give this award to
a pop group?

352
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:26,629
But the usual crowd of screaming fans were
outside Buckingham Palace when the Queen gave

353
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:31,669
them the award in October 1965.

354
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:38,830
The Beatles were nervous - George later remembered
that they rested and had a cigarette in the

355
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,950
toilets in Buckingham Palace!

356
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:49,450
Rubber Soul
The next album, Rubber Soul, came out in December

357
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,970
1965.

358
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,559
It was another big step for the band.

359
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,970
They were exploring different kinds of music
and different subjects.

360
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:09,019
'In My Life' was a beautiful song about places
and people in the past.

361
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:15,960
Even the album's love songs weren't the simple
love songs of the band's early days.

362
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,220
One of the most interesting songs on the album
was John's 'Norwegian Wood'.

363
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,059
Many people wanted to know what the song meant.

364
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:32,539
It was about a girl, but he didn't want his
wife Cynthia to know this.

365
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:38,109
George played the Indian musical instrument
the sitar on 'Norwegian Wood'.

366
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:44,669
He first noticed the instrument in an Indian
restaurant in the film Help!

367
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:53,120
This was the start of George's long interest
in Indian music and ideas.

368
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

369
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:02,309
Around the time of Rubber Soul, the single
'Day Tripper' 'We Can Work It Out' reached

370
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:03,820
number one.

371
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:11,109
Paul wrote most of 'We Can Work It Out' and
John wrote the middle part.

372
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:16,039
This song showed the differences between the
two men clearly.

373
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,440
The main part was more hopeful, as Paul sang,
'Try to see it my way...'

374
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,710
John's part of the song was less hopeful:
'Life is very short and there's no time...'

375
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:38,950
The band's success continued with Paul's 'Paperback
Writer' in 1966.

376
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,600
It was their first single that wasn't about
love.

377
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,009
The music was becoming less and less simple,
too.

378
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:54,690
But now the Beatles faced a new problem - how
could they play the songs in concert?

379
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,499
'Beatles go home!'

380
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:07,559
In June 1966, the Beatles were in Hamburg
again to begin a new tour.

381
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:12,419
Then they flew to Tokyo and the tour began
to go wrong.

382
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,540
There were many Beatles fans in Japan.

383
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,140
But some people there thought the group was
a bad example to young people.

384
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,500
The band had to stay in their hotel.

385
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,919
They only came out to play in concert.

386
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,340
Things became worse in the Philippines.

387
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,419
In George's words, it was 'bad news' from
the beginning.

388
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:42,160
The real problem came after the concert in
Manila.

389
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:48,640
Imelda Marcos, the wife of the country's leader,
invited the band to a party.

390
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,840
The band's answer was a polite no.

391
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,580
(Some of them can't even remember the invitation.)

392
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,110
The next day, something was clearly wrong.

393
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,480
Nobody at the hotel brought breakfast for
the band.

394
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,170
Then they turned on the television and suddenly
they understood: they saw Imelda Marcos in

395
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,020
tears!

396
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,690
The camera showed crying children and the
empty dinner table.

397
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:27,870
In George's words, 'We watched ourselves not
arriving.'

398
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,940
The people of the Philippines were very angry.

399
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:38,750
As the band drove to the airport, crowds shouted,
Beatles go home!

400
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:45,760
The band was pushed around at the airport
and their road manager was knocked over.

401
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,080
Before they could leave, Brian Epstein was
called off the airplane.

402
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,790
He had to give back all the money from the
band's concert there.

403
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,730
Years later, Paul knew more about Marcos's
government.

404
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,900
Then he was happy about missing the garden
party.

405
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,330
Ringo has said about the country, 'I've never
been back

406
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:21,530
The Sound of the Future
The 1966 tour wasn't a happy one, but in the

407
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:27,920
studio that year the band were going into
exciting new areas.

408
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,230
George Martin had to find newer and newer
sounds to record the band's ideas.

409
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,220
The album Revolver was his favorite.

410
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,490
The album was important for all the Beatles
in different ways:

411
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,020
George was growing as a song writer.

412
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,290
At first, it was difficult for the guitarist.

413
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:58,010
His very early songs weren't strong, and he
was in a band with two of the most famous

414
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,820
songwriters in the world.

415
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,750
In Revolvers 'Love You To', he showed his
continuing interest in Indian music.

416
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,650
His best song on the album was probably 'Taxman'.

417
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,010
The band liked Ringo to sing a song on every
album.

418
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:23,010
Paul decided to give the drummer a song that
wasn't very serious.

419
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,970
He thought of 'Yellow Submarine' one night
in bed.

420
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:34,810
Paul continued to write about new subjects
and to explore new kinds of music.

421
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:41,960
'Eleanor Rigby' was a sad song about the lives
of lonely people in a big city.

422
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,330
Again, strings were used, and McCartney recorded
the song without the other Beatles.

423
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,960
'We were just drinking tea,' said George.

424
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,630
John was exploring, too.

425
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:03,990
With the songs 'She Said She Said' and Tomorrow
Never Knows', he went into strange new musical

426
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,630
areas.

427
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:13,370
Tomorrow Never Knows' was like a promise of
the wild music at the end of the 1960s.

428
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,880
Listen to this song and compare it to any
song from the Beatles' first two or three

429
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
albums.

430
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,750
A lot changed in those few years!

431
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,360
Burning Records

432
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,270
In 1966, John spoke to a reporter in London.

433
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:39,680
They were talking about the modern church,
and he said, 'We're more popular than Jesus

434
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,140
now.'

435
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:50,370
When John's words were reported in the US
a few months later, many people were angry.

436
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:58,270
There were newspaper stories like 'Lennon
Says that the Beatles are Bigger than Jesus'.

437
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,220
This wasn't what John meant.

438
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,890
But some shops refused to sell their records.

439
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,660
Some radio stations refused to play them.

440
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:16,670
A few radio stations asked listeners to burn
their Beatles records.

441
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:24,510
Years later, Ringo joked, 'It was OK for us,
because then they bought them again!'

442
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:30,710
But at the time, the band and their manager
were worried.

443
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,750
So what did John mean?

444
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,810
He tried to explain his words to the American
people before the band toured the country

445
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,980
again.

446
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,590
'I was just saying it as a fact,' he explained.

447
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,000
'It is true - more for England than here.

448
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,710
I'm not saying that we're better or greater...

449
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,750
I'm sorry that I opened my mouth.'

450
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:04,800
It was a bad start to the Beatles last tour.

451
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,240
The End of Touring
The tour continued, but it wasn't a happy

452
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,130
time.

453
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,860
Some newspapers in the United States were
against the band now.

454
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:24,450
For the first time, there were a few empty
seats at some concerts.

455
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,970
But it was still impossible to hear the music
because of the screams.

456
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,390
As George said, touring wasn't 'fun' now.

457
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,890
Also, their lives were different.

458
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,020
Only one Beatle - Paul - wasn't married.

459
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,950
It was time to stop travelling.

460
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:53,450
At first, Paul wanted to tour more, but finally
he agreed with the others.

461
00:40:53,450 --> 00:41:01,980
On 29 August 1966, they played at Candlestick
Park in San Francisco.

462
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,880
They played eleven songs, finishing with 'I'm
Down'.

463
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,060
It was the Beatles' last concert.

464
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,750
The band faced a new question: what now?

465
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,710
In his heart, John thought, 'This is the end,
really.'

466
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:28,540
For some time the Beatles all did different
things:

467
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,660
George spent a few weeks in India.

468
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,670
Paul worked with George Martin on the music
for a film, The Family Way.

469
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:42,120
The music won an award.

470
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,490
John went to Spain to act in a film, How I
Won the War.

471
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,970
It wasn't a good film, and John wasn't a good
actor.

472
00:41:51,970 --> 00:42:00,010
But he did come back wearing the famous small,
round 'John Lennon glasses'!

473
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:06,470
Ringo spent a few weeks in Spain with John,
and he enjoyed time at home with his wife

474
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,010
and child.

475
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,330
Back in the studio, the band felt more free.

476
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,090
Now they didn't have to play any new songs
on stage.

477
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:25,460
They could do anything, and they did - with
George Martin's help.

478
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,570
The next songs were another big step into
new musical areas.

479
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:39,330
But they also looked back, as both John and
Paul turned to their Liverpool past for 'Strawberry

480
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:45,640
Fields Forever' and 'Penny Lane'.

481
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,710
STORY BEHIND THE SONGS

482
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,260
When he was a child, John lived near a children's
home.

483
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,010
The home was called Strawberry Field.

484
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:05,430
John's song 'Strawberry Fields Forever' wasn't
really about that place; it just took the

485
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,520
home's name.

486
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,920
The line 'Nothing is real' perfectly described
this strange, beautiful song.

487
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,330
Paul then wrote a song about Liverpool, too.

488
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:28,570
'Penny Lane' was a much happier song, describing
people and places from the old days in Liverpool.

489
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,850
The band was still using instruments that
were unusual in pop records.

490
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,560
A trumpet played on the song.

491
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,940
There were many differences between Paul and
John.

492
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,070
Paul was very interested in studio recording.

493
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:50,700
He worked carefully with George Martin.

494
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,080
John had little time for this.

495
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,220
He just told the producer what he wanted.

496
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:05,260
In fact, the band played Strawberry Fields
Forever' in two very different ways.

497
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,330
John couldn't choose his favorite.

498
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,450
Finally, the producer joined the two.

499
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:18,870
(Years later, John wasn't happy about this
recording of his song.)

500
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:26,750
Together, 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and
'Penny Lane' became the Beatles' next single.

501
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:38,620
It was a great record, but for the first time
in years the band didn't reach number one.

502
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:47,580
The Most Famous Album in the World
In the opinion of some newspapers in early

503
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,940
1967, the Beatles didn't have any more ideas.

504
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,510
And then came Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band.

505
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,620
The title song was Paul's.

506
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:07,500
He had the idea after a trip to the United
States.

507
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,560
Bands with very long names were becoming popular
there.

508
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,790
Paul wanted the Beatles to be a different
band for the album.

509
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:22,630
In his mind, the album was a concert by this
other band.

510
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,060
John and George didn't see the album in this
way.

511
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:33,470
'It doesn't go anywhere,' John once said about
the Sergeant Pepper idea.

512
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,230
But there were great songs on the album.

513
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:44,050
Songs like 'When I'm Sixty-Four' and 'With
a Little Help From My Friends' were happy

514
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,350
and light.

515
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:52,530
John took almost all the words for 'Being
for the Benefit of Mr Kite' from an old sign

516
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,550
that he found in a shop.

517
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:02,550
The words and the music of 'Lucy in the Sky
With Diamonds' were like a dream.

518
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,590
The title came from a picture by John's young
son, Julian.

519
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:15,770
'A Day in the Life' was one of the best examples
of Paul and John's strong points.

520
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:22,870
John wrote the main part of the song, beginning
'I read the news today, oh boy.'

521
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,970
The idea came from two newspaper stories.

522
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,580
Paul added the middle part.

523
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,000
It worked perfectly in John's song.

524
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,230
The album was a big step in the band's music.

525
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:43,770
They used the studio wonderfully, but this
took a long time.

526
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:50,640
The Beatles' first album was made in around
twelve hours, but Sergeant Pepper took over

527
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,220
700 hours!

528
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:59,500
Both Ringo and George said later that it was
sometimes boring.

529
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,570
'My heart was still in India,' George said.

530
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:10,310
Famous faces

531
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,900
Everything about the album was special - even
the cover.

532
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:23,120
It showed the band with a crowd of famous
people - writers, singers, actors, thinkers.

533
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:29,220
At first there was a photo of Mahatma Gandhi,
but the record company asked the band to take

534
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,640
it off.

535
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,670
They didn't want to make people in India angry.

536
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:40,730
Today, fans disagree about which is the best
Beatles album.

537
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:46,580
But most of them believe that Sergeant Pepper
was the most important.

538
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:51,050
The world was changing fast in 1967.

539
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:57,670
While the American war in Vietnam continued,
young people around the world were exploring

540
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,780
new ideas, new sounds.

541
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:07,770
The summer of 1967 became known as 'the summer
of love'.

542
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,190
Sergeant Pepper helped to make that summer.

543
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:20,370
Life and Death
Not long after Sergeant Pepper, the Beatles

544
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:26,840
were invited to play in a live television
programme called Our World.

545
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,480
Different countries had to make different
parts of the show, and the makers of the programme

546
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,190
wanted the Beatles to play for Britain's part.

547
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:47,780
John wrote the song and on 25 June 1967, about
350 million people all around the world watched

548
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,050
the programme.

549
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,720
The Beatles weren't alone in the television
studio.

550
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,940
A lot of other musicians played and it was
like a big party.

551
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,080
Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger were both there.

552
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:09,770
John's song was perfect for the programme:
'All You Need Is Love' was a mirror for the

553
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:19,000
dreams and hopes of young people around the
world in 1967.

554
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,910
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

555
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:28,550
At the end of 'All You Need Is Love', the
Beatles joked about two of their old songs.

556
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:36,640
John sang 'Yesterday' and Paul sang a line
from 'She Loves You'.

557
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,580
Around this time, George was continuing to
learn more about Eastern ideas.

558
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:51,980
He asked John and Paul to listen to a talk
by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London.

559
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:57,940
The Maharishi was an Indian who taught Eastern
ways of thinking.

560
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,510
The Beatles wanted to know more.

561
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:07,750
In August, all four of them took a train to
Bangor in North Wales.

562
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:14,050
They wanted to spend a few days studying with
the Maharishi.

563
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,930
A sad sign

564
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:23,720
Cynthia Lennon wanted to go too, but the usual
Beatles crowds were at the train station and

565
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,750
Cynthia missed the train.

566
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,030
She watched as her husband left without her.

567
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:36,000
For her, this was a sign of the end of their
marriage.

568
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,720
While the Beatles were searching for the meaning
of life, sad news reached them from London.

569
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,980
Brian Epstein was dead.

570
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:50,360
'He was one of us,' John told a reporter.

571
00:50:50,360 --> 00:51:00,060
On the Bus
Epstein's death brought another problem.

572
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,930
The Beatles knew nothing about business.

573
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:07,700
'We were in trouble then,' said John.

574
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:14,420
Ringo has described the band as 'chickens
without heads' at that time.

575
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,420
In the middle of this difficult time, Paul
had an idea.

576
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,390
He wanted to make a television film.

577
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:28,490
He was trying to help the band, but in John
and George's opinion, Paul was trying to lead

578
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,190
them.

579
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:33,510
The idea for the film was simple.

580
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:39,750
Forty-three people - with the Beatles - drove
around the country in a bus.

581
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,740
This time, they didn't have a story to act.

582
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,960
They just filmed what happened.

583
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,120
There was one problem - nothing really did
happen.

584
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:58,930
Magical Mystery Tour was shown on television
in Britain just after Christmas, 1967.

585
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,490
Almost fifteen million people watched.

586
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:10,120
They loved the songs, like Paul's The Fool
on the Hill' and Johns 'I Am the Walrus'.

587
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,740
But not many people liked the film.

588
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,890
The color film was shown in black and white
on television.

589
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:20,620
But this wasn't the reason why it wasn't popular.

590
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:26,270
For some people it was boring, for others
it was too strange.

591
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:32,500
For the first time, the Beatles really failed.

592
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,700
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

593
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:41,810
The idea for 'I Am The Walrus' came from Lewis
Carroll's book Alice in Wonderland.

594
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:47,420
John said, 'The words don't say a lot...'

595
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:55,630
In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to
India to study again with the Maharishi.

596
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,760
The trip had a different meaning for each
of them.

597
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:07,360
Ringo went with two suitcases - one of clothes
and one of English food in tins!

598
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,510
He didn't stay long.

599
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,900
Paul says that he enjoyed this time in India.

600
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,900
But John and George stayed longer.

601
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:25,310
George continued to defend the Maharishi,
but John soon became angry at their old teacher.

602
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:29,970
A song on the band's next album was an angry
attack on him.

603
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:37,020
Back in Britain, there were no simple answers
in business for the Beatles.

604
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,480
They opened the Apple shop in London.

605
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:48,000
Paul called it 'a beautiful place where you
can buy beautiful things.'

606
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,840
The shop lost money almost immediately.

607
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,480
But Apple was more than a shop.

608
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,540
It was a big company that produced music and
films.

609
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,310
The Beatles began to produce other musicians.

610
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,550
Paul was most interested in Apple's business.

611
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:11,040
He was there more because he lived in London.

612
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,450
But the others felt that Paul was trying to
lead the band again.

613
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,160
Yellow Submarine

614
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,240
In July 1968, there was another Beatles film
in cinemas.

615
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,340
The band recorded a few new songs for Yellow
Submarine, but they didn't even do the voices

616
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,420
in the film.

617
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:44,510
In the story, the band saved a strange place
called Pepperland with their music.

618
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:53,330
A New Album and a New Love
In 1968, Cynthia and John Lennon's marriage

619
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,560
ended.

620
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,180
John was with Yoko Ono now.

621
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:06,600
He first met the Japanese-American artist
at an art show in 1966 and they slowly fell

622
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,240
in love.

623
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

624
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:17,700
Paul felt sorry for Cynthia and Julian Lennon.

625
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,820
The boy was only five.

626
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,970
Paul wrote a song for him.

627
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:33,480
He later changed the words from 'Hey Jules'
to 'Hey Jude'.

628
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,460
Everything changed for John with Yoko.

629
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,540
He often spoke of her as his teacher.

630
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,160
Together they explored new ideas.

631
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,550
These were called crazy by many people, but
John and Yoko weren't worried.

632
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:54,590
They made their first record together in one
night.

633
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,820
It was an exploration of sounds.

634
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,140
But the biggest news was the cover.

635
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,430
It showed John and Yoko without any clothes.

636
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:12,100
'We just wanted to be together all the time,'
remembered John.

637
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:19,210
John and Yoko were together in the studio,
too, as the Beatles started their next album.

638
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:23,390
This soon became a problem for the other Beatles.

639
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:27,210
Ringo asked him, 'What's this all about?'

640
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,490
The other two and George Martin were angrier.

641
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:38,880
When Yoko was ill, John even brought a bed
into the studio for her!

642
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,030
In 1968 the Beatles' White Album had other
problems.

643
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,390
Ringo left the band for a time.

644
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:52,000
(The band recorded a few songs without him.)

645
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,671
In his opinion, the other Beatles didn't need
him.

646
00:56:54,671 --> 00:57:00,530
When they all asked him back, the drummer
returned happily.

647
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,660
'I loved the White Album', he remembers now.

648
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,160
But not everyone had this opinion.

649
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:15,240
John spoke about the start of the band's 'slow
death' at this time.

650
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,950
The musical interests in the band were more
and more different.

651
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:24,270
The Beatles were less and less a real group.

652
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:30,160
Sometimes the album was recorded in three
different studios at the same time, as John,

653
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,710
Paul and George worked on their own songs.

654
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:39,230
The double album mixed many different kinds
of music.

655
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:47,430
'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da' was a happy pop song,
while 'Revolution 9' was a strange piece of

656
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,080
sound art.'

657
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:57,170
In 'Back in the USSR' the band cleverly sounded
like the Beach Boys.

658
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:03,930
George's best song on the album was probably
'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'.

659
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:10,080
His friend Eric Clapton joined the band to
play on this song.

660
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,080
Secret messages

661
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:18,980
Two songs from the album later became famous
for the wrong reasons.

662
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:26,500
In the mind of Californian Charles Manson,
the songs 'Piggies' and 'Helter Skelter' were

663
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,930
secret messages telling him to kill.

664
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:37,520
George Martin thought that there were too
many different songs on the double album.

665
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,810
He wanted it to be an excellent single album.

666
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:46,600
But Paul has said, 'It's a fine little album.'

667
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:53,670
John also liked the simpler way of recording.

668
00:58:53,670 --> 00:59:02,670
An Unhappy Film and Two Weddings
At the start of 1969, the band needed new

669
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,850
plans.

670
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:08,990
Paul was full of ideas for the band's future.

671
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:15,590
They decided to write an album and then play
it on stage - all in front of cameras.

672
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,460
This was the start of Let It Be.

673
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,380
It was a bad time.

674
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:27,960
The band weren't happy together, and all the
cameras made everything worse.

675
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:34,420
George even left the band for a short time
after angry words with Paul.

676
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:42,250
Things only got better when a guest musician,
American Billy Preston, joined them.

677
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,570
The cameras filmed everything.

678
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:50,990
The cameramen didn't know it at the time,
but in fact they were recording the end of

679
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,710
the group.

680
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:59,450
The film Let It Be is difficult to watch at
times.

681
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,240
The idea of a big concert soon died.

682
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:09,550
Looking for a way to end the film, the band
decided to play a few songs on the Apple building's

683
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,760
roof.

684
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,840
People in London looked up in surprise as
the Beatles played 'Get Back' above them.

685
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,990
For a short time, the old days were back!

686
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:28,880
In Ringo's words, when the music was good,
they forgot all the problems.

687
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:35,230
Finally, the police asked the band to stop.

688
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:41,220
They never played live together again.

689
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:46,890
Producer George Martin didn't want to touch
the long Let It Be recordings.

690
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,980
So American Phil Spector took the job.

691
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:57,790
Finally, the Let It Be album came out after
the end of the Beatles.

692
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,150
Paul didn't like Spector's work on it.

693
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:10,490
Both he and George Martin hated the strings
on The Long and Winding Road'.

694
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:19,190
In 1969, Paul married for the first time and
John married for the second time.

695
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:25,100
Even the two marriages showed the differences
between the two men.

696
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:31,640
Paul married American photographer Linda Eastman
on 12 March.

697
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:38,050
They wanted a quiet wedding, but nothing could
be quiet for a Beatle.

698
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:44,950
Hundreds of fans cried as Paul and his new
wife drove away.

699
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:49,370
Weeks later, John and Yoko were married in
Gibraltar.

700
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,180
The story is told in the song 'The Ballad
of John and Yoko.'

701
01:01:54,180 --> 01:02:00,420
Later, they invited reporters to a 'bed-in'
at their hotel.

702
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,670
They stayed in bed for seven days.

703
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:07,460
They wanted people to think about the meaning
of love.

704
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:16,500
(At a later 'bed-in', they recorded the song
'Give Peace a Chance'.)

705
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:23,800
John and Yoko gave their opinions on a lot
of subjects, like the Vietnam War.

706
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,680
John sent his MBE back to the British government.

707
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:34,800
He had more and more interests in his life,
and the band wasn't one of them.

708
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:40,900
But the Beatles stayed together for one more
record.

709
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:51,130
The Last Album
After the troubles on Let It Be, George Martin

710
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:56,120
was surprised to receive a telephone call
from Paul.

711
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,000
The band wanted to make another album.

712
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,040
Paul and Martin agreed to do one the 'old'
way - in the studio.

713
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:13,240
The album was named after the Abbey Road studio
in London, and the Beatles worked on it there

714
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,760
during July and August 1969.

715
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:24,410
John and Paul disagreed about some of their
ideas for the album.

716
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:28,510
Paul wanted to join all the songs together.

717
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:33,730
John just liked to do different 'three-minute
records'.

718
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:41,350
To keep both men happy, only the songs on
the second half of the record are joined together.

719
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:46,610
Abbey Road was a happy record to work on for
most of the time.

720
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,740
But not always.

721
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:55,800
When Paul took three days to record 'Maxwell's
Silver Hammer', George told him, 'It's only

722
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,700
a song.'

723
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,590
STORY BEHIND THE SONG

724
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:09,240
Abbey Road's 'Something' was the band's first
single written by George Harrison.

725
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,140
Many people think that it is his best song.

726
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,150
Later, Frank Sinatra often sang it on stage.

727
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:23,670
He described it as his favorite Lennon and
McCartney song.

728
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:30,710
Telling this story, Paul once joked, 'Thanks,
Frank.'

729
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:35,190
Nobody knew it at the time, but Abbey Road
was the last album.

730
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:39,060
But the band ended it well.

731
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,900
The last song was called 'The End.'

732
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,700
John, Paul and George all played guitar on
it.

733
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,640
All four Beatles were playing together as
a real band again.

734
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,050
You can hear the fun in the music.

735
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:59,950
Paul sang the last lines of the last album.

736
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,750
They were about love.

737
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:08,840
Paul Is dead!

738
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:17,300
After Abbey Road arrived in the shops in October
1969, a radio station in the US started a

739
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,560
strange story about Paul.

740
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,560
He was dead!

741
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:26,550
The 'signs' were on the album's cover.

742
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,720
Paul wasn't wearing shoes.

743
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,950
In some countries, dead people are dressed
in clothes but not shoes.

744
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,440
The story grew.

745
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,350
The hand over Paul's head on the cover of
Sergeant Pepper was, fans decided, a sign

746
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:45,580
of death.

747
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:52,960
A line in 'A Day in the Life' was also about
Paul's death.

748
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,050
More and more signs were found.

749
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:03,830
But if Paul was dead, who was the new person
on the front of Abbey Road?

750
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,430
The story became sillier.

751
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,890
It was a man called William Campbell.

752
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:17,440
Or it was Billy Shears (a singer's name from
the title song on Sergeant Pepper).

753
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,800
This new person looked exactly like Paul,
of course.

754
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:28,310
Finally, Life magazine found Paul on his farm
in Scotland.

755
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:31,400
The magazine proved it.

756
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,860
Paul wasn't dead.

757
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:43,460
Paul described himself as 'the last to know'
about his death.

758
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:49,530
Differences of Opinion
Even before Abbey Road, the Beatles' company

759
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:53,200
Apple was losing a lot of money.

760
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,170
Something had to change.

761
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:58,940
They needed someone to manage the business.

762
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:06,480
John wanted Allan Klein, the manager of the
Rolling Stones, to be the group's manager.

763
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,720
George and Ringo agreed, but Paul didn't.

764
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:18,000
He wanted Lee Eastman - his wife's father
- to manage Apple's business.

765
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,720
Paul was still full of ideas for the band
and the company, but it was too late.

766
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:31,710
In one meeting, John spoke about the end of
the Beatles: 'It feels good.'

767
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:36,130
In fact, Paul ended the band in 1970.

768
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:43,080
A few weeks after his first album McCartney
was in the shops, he told the world.

769
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:50,420
He was leaving the Beatles 'because of personal,
business and musical differences'.

770
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:56,560
The band was finished, but the fights about
business and money continued in court for

771
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,140
years.

772
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:05,010
It was a sad end for the greatest band in
the world.

773
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:13,880
Life After the Beatles
All four of the Beatles found success alone.

774
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,460
Ringo acted in a few films and he continued
to make records.

775
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,650
His 1973 album Ringo was a big success.

776
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:29,200
All the other Beatles played on this album...
but not at the same time.

777
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,540
Ringo is still playing and touring with his
All Starr Band.

778
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:41,250
Many of Ringo's famous friends from the world
of music - and his son, Zak - have played

779
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,810
in this band.

780
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:48,790
Many British children know and love Ringo
for another reason.

781
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:57,109
He was the voice of a train in a famous children's
television programme!

782
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:02,609
George seemed happy to be away from the shadows
of Lennon and McCartney.

783
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:10,310
His 1970 album All Things Must Pass reached
number one around the world.

784
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:17,980
George's most famous song in the 1970s was
'My Sweet Lord', but he was taken to court

785
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,810
because of it.

786
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:25,750
In the court's opinion, part of it was copied
from an old song.

787
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:32,440
In the early 1980s, George also played in
the Travelling Wilburys with Bob Dylan and

788
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,770
Roy Orbison.

789
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:40,380
George became interested in films, but not
as an actor.

790
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:48,089
He produced films like Monty Python's Life
of Brian and Time Bandits.

791
01:09:48,089 --> 01:09:53,740
In 1999, someone failed to kill George in
his home.

792
01:09:53,740 --> 01:10:02,230
But sadly, two years later, he died after
a long illness.

793
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:06,200
Paul has had the most success after the Beatles.

794
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:12,860
After the albums McCartney and Ram, he wanted
to be in a real band again.

795
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:22,310
In 1971 he started a new band, Wings, with
his wife Linda and guitarist Denny Laine.

796
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:27,420
At first, Wings drove all over Britain playing
small concerts.

797
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,940
It was like the old days of the Beatles again.

798
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,210
Wings soon became big.

799
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:42,710
1973's Band on the Run was Paul's most successful
album.

800
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:47,830
In 1977, the band recorded 'Mull of Kintyre'.

801
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:53,870
This song sold more than any other single
in Britain before that time.

802
01:10:53,870 --> 01:11:00,860
Wings ended in 1981, but Paul continued making
records.

803
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,940
In 1997, he was back at Buckingham Palace.

804
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:09,470
He became Sir Paul McCartney.

805
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:16,630
Paul has sold millions of records since 1970,
but one of his biggest successes was his happy

806
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:21,200
family life with Linda and their children.

807
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:26,250
Sadly, in 1998, Linda McCartney died.

808
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:34,000
Paul now has another woman, Heather Mills,
in his life.

809
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,820
John and Yoko moved to New York.

810
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:44,290
They still spoke openly on many subjects,
and at one time the American government wanted

811
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:47,380
to throw him out of the country.

812
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:53,810
Some of John's most interesting work was on
his first two albums, John Lennon Plastic

813
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:58,230
Ono Band and Imagine.

814
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:05,310
On the first album, John sang painfully honest
songs about his mothers death.

815
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:14,630
In another song, he sang the words, 'I don't
believe in Beatles I just believe in me.'

816
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:21,630
The title song of Imagine is probably his
most famous song.

817
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:28,660
Most people think that John's later work in
the 1970s wasn't as good.

818
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:33,320
For some time, John and Yoko weren't together.

819
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,650
John called this his 'lost weekend', but it
lasted eighteen months.

820
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:46,000
Back with Yoko, John didn't make music for
a few years.

821
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,500
He looked after their son, Sean.

822
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:56,040
He returned to the recording studio in the
summer of 1980 to make Double Fantasy with

823
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,040
Yoko.

824
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,790
Much of the album was about family life.

825
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:08,400
One of the songs from the album, '(Just Like)
Starting Over' was doing well when John was

826
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,650
killed.

827
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,840
Friends again

828
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,530
The Beatles ended badly, and some of the band
were angry for a long time.

829
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:28,700
On 1971's Imagine, John's song 'How Do You
Sleep?'

830
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,730
was an attack on Paul.

831
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:37,770
(George Harrison was angry too - he played
guitar on the song.)

832
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:42,880
But finally, Paul and John became friendlier
again.

833
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:50,590
Paul visited John a few times in New York
after Sean Lennon's birth.

834
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:59,320
In 1994, years after John's death, both men
were given an important music award.

835
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,700
On stage, Paul read out a letter to John.

836
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,400
In it, he remembered their past together.

837
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:17,770
He ended, 'This letter comes, with love, from
your friend Paul.'

838
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:25,890
At the Top Again
The Beatles ruled the music world in the 1960s.

839
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:33,540
They had twenty-two singles in Britain, and
eighteen reached number one.

840
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:37,620
Every album of new songs got to number one.

841
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:43,190
In the United States, there were nineteen
number one singles.

842
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:49,500
Many people still think that they were the
world's greatest band of all time.

843
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:57,230
In one list of best albums, the top five were
all by the Beatles!

844
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:02,520
But the band's success wasn't just for their
musical past.

845
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:11,170
In 1995, the three living Beatles came together
to record two 'new' Beatles songs - 'Free

846
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:14,820
as a Bird' and 'Real Love'.

847
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:18,250
Both songs were by John.

848
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:22,600
The singer recorded them, but they weren't
finished.

849
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,650
Paul, George and Ringo worked with these recordings,
adding to them.

850
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:36,340
In their minds, they were finishing the music
for John while he worked on something else.

851
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:41,360
Fans could buy new Beatles records again!

852
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,790
They also loved the video for 'Free as a Bird'.

853
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:54,130
It showed people and places from the band's
past - Stu Sutcliffe, Brian Epstein, The Cavern,

854
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:57,600
the street outside the Abbey Road studios.

855
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,520
There were hundreds of memories of Beatles
songs.

856
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,520
A few are:

857
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,670
a cake with the number sixty-four ('When I'm
Sixty-Four')

858
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:14,750
a man writing a book ('Paperback Writer')

859
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:18,480
a photo of Mao Tse Tung (a line from 'Revolution')

860
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,000
a stone with the name Eleanor Rigby ('Eleanor
Rigby')

861
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:32,920
At the same time, the living Beatles told
their story in the television programme The

862
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,400
Beatles Anthology.

863
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,739
More than twenty million copies of the Anthology
albums were sold.

864
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:47,370
In 2000, there was a very successful album
of the Beatles' number one songs.

865
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:53,040
They made more money from the album than any
other British artist that year.

866
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,410
The Beatles were back in the right place - at
the top!

867
01:16:57,410 --> 01:16:57,770
- THE END -
