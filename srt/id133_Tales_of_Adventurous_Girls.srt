1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:11,580
Tamasha and the Troll
Tamasha lived with her mother and two sisters

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,430
on the beautiful island of Zanzibar.

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:27,410
One day, the sisters went to the beach, and
Tamasha found a beautiful white shell.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,419
She held it near to her ear.

5
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:31,839
"Oh!

6
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,620
I can hear the sea!"

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,370
she thought.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,329
Then she sang the song of the sea.

9
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:47,019
In the evening, the sisters walked home.

10
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,190
"Oh!

11
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,260
I forgot my shell!"

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,989
Tamasha cried.

13
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,739
Then she ran back to the beach.

14
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,809
Her sisters did not go with her.

15
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,610
Tamasha found her shell on a rock.

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,840
She was very happy, and she sang her song
again.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,820
But Zamia, the big, bad troll, was behind
the rock.

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,330
He heard Tamasha's song.

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,700
"You can sing very well," he said.

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,360
"You can help me."

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,910
Zimwi had a big drum, and he put Tamasha inside
it.

22
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,780
Zimwi hit the drum.

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,060
"Now you must sing!" he cried.

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,250
Tamasha sang her song inside the drum.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:04,340
Zimwi carried the drum to a village.

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:12,570
"This drum can sing," he said to the villagers.

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,040
Then he hit the drum, and Tamasha sang.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,170
"Now bring me some food!" he cried.

29
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:32,180
The villagers liked the song, and they brought
Zimwi lots of food.

30
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,720
Zimwi carried the drum to lots of villages.

31
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,359
"Sing, drum," he always said.

32
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:48,780
Then he hit it, and Tamasha sang.

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,189
But Zimwi never listened to her songs.

34
00:02:54,189 --> 00:03:04,790
The villagers gave Zimwi lots of food, but
Tamasha was very sad.

35
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,510
One day, Zimwi visited Tamasha's village.

36
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,569
Tamasha heard her mother's voice.

37
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,810
"Sing, drum!"

38
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,099
cried Zimwi.

39
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,739
Then he hit the drum.

40
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:29,920
Tamasha sang, "Mother, I'm inside the drum."

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,060
"It's Tamasha!"

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,280
thought her mother.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,579
"We must help her!"

44
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:45,709
"Bring me food," Zimwi said to the villagers.

45
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:52,920
"I can cook you some food," said Tamasha's
mother.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,299
"But I need some water from the river."

47
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,219
Zimwi went to the river.

48
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,549
Tamasha's mother opened the drum and found
Tamasha.

49
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:15,909
Tamasha's mother was very angry with Zimwi.

50
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:21,300
Then she had an idea.

51
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,840
She caught some bees and put them in the drum.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,770
Zimwi brought back some water from the river.

53
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,510
"Play your drum again!"

54
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,320
the villagers cried.

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,950
"Sing, drum!" said Zimwi.

56
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,900
Then he hit it.

57
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,530
But the drum did not sing.

58
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,150
Zimwi hit it again.

59
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,870
"SING!" he cried.

60
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:05,240
Then the drum opened, and the bees flew out
of it.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,610
The bees were angry, and they flew towards
Zimwi.

62
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,690
"Ahhh!" he cried.

63
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,520
Zimwi ran out of the village.

64
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,380
Tamasha and her family never saw him again.

65
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:39,520
Tokoyo and the Sea Serpent
Tokoyo's father was the Emperor of Japan's

66
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,430
favourite samurai.

67
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,660
The samurai loved his daughter, and she loved
him.

68
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,840
Tokoyo's father was a good teacher.

69
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:07,220
He taught her how to swim, and how to use
a knife, and a bow and arrow.

70
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:17,740
One day, Tokoyo's father visited the Emperor,
but the Emperor was confused.

71
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,990
He was confused because he was ill.

72
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:33,890
"Go to the island of Oki, and don't come back!"
the Emperor told Tokoyo's father.

73
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:41,780
The samurai went to Oki, and Tokoyo cried
every day.

74
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:49,690
Then, Tokoyo thought, "I must find Father."

75
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:57,320
Tokoyo travelled for many weeks.

76
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,720
One day, she saw the sea, and the island of
Oki.

77
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,850
There was a village near the sea.

78
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:16,670
"Please take me to the island," Tokoyo said
to the villagers.

79
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,280
"No," they said.

80
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,680
"We're frightened of the sea because a serpent
lives there."

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,460
Tokoyo found an old boat.

82
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,310
Voices from the sea cried, "Go back!"

83
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:46,160
But Tokoyo was brave, and she went to Oki
in the boat.

84
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,970
Then she saw a man and a girl at the top of
a cliff.

85
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,180
The girl was very frightened.

86
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,950
Tokoyo ran to the cliff.

87
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,260
"Why are you in this dangerous place?"

88
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,610
she cried.

89
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:14,820
"I must throw the girl in the sea," said the
man.

90
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,670
"Every year, we have to throw a girl to the
serpent.

91
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,430
Then it doesn't kill people in our village."

92
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,300
Tokoyo was angry.

93
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,000
"I can kill the serpent!"

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,849
she cried.

95
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:46,430
Tokoyo carried her knife in her mouth, and
she swam to the bottom of the sea.

96
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:55,759
She found a statue of the Emperor, and she
found the serpent.

97
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:05,899
Tokoyo was very brave, and she killed the
serpent with her knife.

98
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:11,100
She took the serpent's body to the man and
the girl.

99
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,350
"You helped us," said the girl.

100
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,800
"How can we help you?"

101
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,550
"Please find my father," said Tokoyo.

102
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,120
"The Emperor sent him to Oki."

103
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,830
The girl smiled.

104
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:42,879
"Your father is living in our village," she
said, and she took Tokoyo to him.

105
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,759
Tokoyo and her father went home.

106
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,449
"The Emperor is well now," people said.

107
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:59,769
"Then let's visit him," said Tokoyo's father.

108
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:03,829
The Emperor smiled at them.

109
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:08,769
Then he said, "What is that?"

110
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:18,220
"I killed a serpent, and I found this statue
of you," said Tokoyo.

111
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,709
"There was a curse on that statue.

112
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:32,519
I am well because you killed the serpent and
found that statue," said the Emperor.

113
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,970
"You are brave, Tokoyo.

114
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,310
You can be a samurai now!"

115
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:49,029
Tokoyo and her father were very happy.

116
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:59,470
Chandra and the Elephants
Chandra lived with her parents in a village

117
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,100
in India.

118
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,269
She washed the Rajah's elephants every day.

119
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:12,550
She loved the elephants, and they loved her.

120
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,290
The villagers grew rice.

121
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,639
Chandra's mother and father grew rice, too.

122
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:29,100
"I can help you," said the Rajah to the villagers.

123
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,100
"Let me look after your rice."

124
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:41,279
The villagers brought their rice to him.

125
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:48,360
One year, it did not rain, and the villagers
did not have any food.

126
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,050
"Can we have our rice?"

127
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,009
they asked the Rajah.

128
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,290
"No!" said the greedy Rajah.

129
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:09,550
The villagers were hungry, but Chandra did
not stop working.

130
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,769
She washed the elephants every day.

131
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:22,870
But, one day, the Rajah's guards said, "You
can't wash the elephants today.

132
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,939
They are very ill."

133
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,529
Chandra was worried.

134
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,610
"Can I talk to the Rajah, please?"

135
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,019
she asked.

136
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,839
The guards took her to the Rajah in his beautiful
palace.

137
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,870
In front of him was a board with black and
white squares.

138
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,110
"What do you want, little girl?" he said.

139
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,870
"I'm Chandra.

140
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,250
I wash your elephants," she said.

141
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,170
"I can help them.

142
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,269
Please can I see them?"

143
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:10,230
"Yes, you can," said the Rajah.

144
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:20,149
The guards took Chandra to the elephants,
and the big animals walked slowly towards

145
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,110
her.

146
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,079
"Oh!

147
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,240
You are very ill!" said Chandra, sadly.

148
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
Then she looked at their bodies.

149
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,959
"Oh!"

150
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,129
she said.

151
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:40,370
"Your ears hurt!

152
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,680
I must clean them."

153
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,329
Chandra cleaned the elephants' ears, and,
after three days, the elephants were well

154
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,339
again.

155
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,759
The Rajah was very happy.

156
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,709
"Thank you.

157
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:05,970
What can I give you?" he asked.

158
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,880
Chandra thought about the hungry villagers.

159
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,619
"You can give me some rice," she said.

160
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:19,639
"Of course.

161
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:27,600
How much rice do you want?" asked the Rajah.

162
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,709
Chandra looked at the Rajah's board.

163
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:39,930
"Please put one grain of rice on the first
square," she said.

164
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:51,559
"Then put two grains of rice on the second
square, and put four grains on the third square."

165
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,899
"I understand," said the Rajah.

166
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:03,779
"We must double the number of grains on every
square.

167
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,680
Let's start."

168
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:15,119
The Rajah's guards put all the rice in the
palace on the board.

169
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:18,470
Then the Rajah was worried.

170
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,850
"There are sixty-four squares.

171
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,029
I can't put rice on all the squares," he said.

172
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,439
"That is too much rice!

173
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,869
What can I do?"

174
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,050
Chandra smiled at him.

175
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,970
"You've got the villagers' rice," she said.

176
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,769
"Give it back to them."

177
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:59,010
"Of course," said the Rajah, and he was never
greedy again.

178
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:10,980
Ideas and inventors
Sea Girl lived in a small village near a big

179
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,019
mountain in China.

180
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:22,540
Sometimes, it did not rain, and the villagers'
rice did not grow.

181
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,240
"I must help my family," Sea Girl thought.

182
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,750
One day, she found a beautiful lake on the
mountain.

183
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,649
"We need water," Sea Girl thought.

184
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,309
"There is lots of water in this lake."

185
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:52,029
Then she looked at the rocks next to the lake.

186
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:58,750
"We can't take this water down the mountain,"
she thought, sadly.

187
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,569
"These rocks are too big."

188
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:10,839
Then she saw a door in the rocks, and she
had an idea.

189
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,540
"The lake is behind the door," she thought.

190
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,299
"I must open the door."

191
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,329
A white bird flew near her.

192
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,970
"You must find the key for the door," it said.

193
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,130
"Where can I find the key?"

194
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,500
cried Sea Girl.

195
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,740
But the white bird flew away.

196
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,340
Then a red bird spoke to her.

197
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:52,110
"You must speak to the Dragon King's daughter,"
it said.

198
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,360
"Where can I find her?"

199
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,130
cried Sea Girl.

200
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,320
But the red bird flew away.

201
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,149
A blue bird stood near her.

202
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,620
"Sing!

203
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:14,000
The Dragon King's daughter loves songs," it
said.

204
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,190
Then it flew away.

205
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,690
Sea Girl sang two songs.

206
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,059
Then a girl walked out of the lake.

207
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,890
"Your songs are beautiful!"

208
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,019
the girl said.

209
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:38,230
"Thank you," said Sea Girl.

210
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:43,740
"Are you the Dragon King's daughter?"

211
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,059
"Yes," said the girl.

212
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,940
"Who are you?

213
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,450
Why are you here?"

214
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:59,519
"I'm Sea Girl, and I need water from this
lake for my village," said Sea Girl.

215
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,399
"Can you help me?"

216
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:07,670
"Yes, I can," said the girl.

217
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:15,280
"You can open the door to the lake with my
father's key," said the girl.

218
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,159
"It's in his cave, but a grey bird guards
the cave."

219
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,940
The two girls went to the Dragon King's cave.

220
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,910
The grey bird sat on a rock near it.

221
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,909
"The bird likes songs," said the girl.

222
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,880
"I must sing to it."

223
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:49,899
The girl sang songs for the grey bird, and
it moved towards her.

224
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:58,260
Sea Girl ran into the cave, and she found
the key in a small brown box.

225
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,100
Then the girls ran away.

226
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:13,390
The girls opened the door with the key, and
the water went down the mountain.

227
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,421
Now there was a beautiful little river in
the village.

228
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:24,260
The villagers' rice grew, and no one was hungry
again.

229
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,010
- THE END -
