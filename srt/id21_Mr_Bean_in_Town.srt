CHAPTER ONE
Steak Tartare

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:09,550
It was Mr. Bean's birthday, and he wanted
to enjoy it!

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,550
What could he do?

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,440
'How can I make this important day a happy
day?' he thought.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,470
'I know.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,750
I'll go out to a restaurant for dinner this
evening!

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,109
I'll enjoy that.

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,109
'

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,359
Mr. Bean didn't often eat in restaurants.

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,149
They were sometimes very expensive.

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:35,390
And he sometimes did things wrong when he
was in a new or strange place.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,200
Oh dear!

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,050
Life wasn't easy for Mr. Bean!

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,050
***

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,050
That evening, Mr. Bean put on a clean shirt.

16
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,660
He put on his best coat and trousers.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,610
He put on his best shoes.

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,490
Then he drove to a restaurant in the centre
of town.

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,300
He arrived at eight o'clock and went inside.

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,220
It was a very nice restaurant.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,460
Everybody was wearing their best clothes,
and there were flowers on every table.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,580
'I'm going to like it here, ' thought Mr.
Bean.

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,990
'This is a good restaurant for my birthday
dinner.

24
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,990
'

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,990
The manager met him at the door.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,850
'Good evening, sir, ' he said.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,650
'How are you?

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,540
Would you like a table for one?'

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,330
'Yes, please, ' said Mr. Bean.

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,090
'Follow me, sir, ' said the manager.

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,510
He walked across the room to a table, and
Mr. Bean went after him.

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,830
'Here you are, sir, ' said the manager.

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,850
'This is a nice table.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,850
'

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,729
He pulled the chair away from the table.

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,979
Then he waited for Mr. Bean to sit down.

37
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,880
Mr. Bean looked at him.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,979
'Why is he taking my chair away?'

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,170
thought Mr. Bean.

40
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,020
'What's he doing?'

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,490
And he pulled the chair away from the manager
and sat down quickly.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,090
When the manager went away, Mr. Bean sat quietly
for a minute.

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,860
Then he remembered something.

44
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,740
He took a birthday card and an envelope out
of his jacket.

45
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:20,290
Next, he took out a pen and wrote 'Happy Birthday,
Bean' inside the card.

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,810
Then he put the card into the envelope and
wrote his name on the outside of it.

47
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,970
He put it on the table, and put his pen back
into his jacket.

48
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,870
After a minute or two, Mr. Bean pretended
to see the card for the first time.

49
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,870
'Oh!

50
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,340
A card - for me?' he said.

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,450
He opened the envelope and took out the card.

52
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,819
He read it carefully.

53
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,780
'Now that's nice!' he said.

54
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,310
'Somebody remembered my birthday!'

55
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,599
And he stood the card on his table.

56
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,910
The manager arrived with the menu and gave
it to Mr. Bean.

57
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,200
Mr. Bean started to read it.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,720
'Oh, dear!' he thought.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,690
'Everything's very expensive!

60
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,870
What can I have?'

61
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,270
Mr. Bean got out his money.

62
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,849
He had a ten-pound note and some coins.

63
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:18,870
He put the money on to a plate.

64
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,519
'How much have I got?' he said, and he moved
the money round on the plate.

65
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,940
'Ten, eleven...

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,840
And forty, fifty, fifty-five!

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,719
Eleven pounds and fifty-five pence.

68
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,719
'

69
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,980
He looked at the menu again.

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,160
What could he eat for eleven pounds fifty-five?

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,940
The manager came to his table.

72
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,000
'Are you ready, sir?' he asked.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,980
'Yes, ' said Mr. Bean.

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,850
He put his finger on the menu.

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,060
'I'll have that, please.

76
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
'

77
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
The manager looked at the menu.

78
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,070
'The steak tartare, sir.

79
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,380
Yes, of course.

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
'

81
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,940
'Yes, ' said Mr. Bean.

82
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,150
'Steak.

83
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,150
'

84
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,950
The manager took the menu and went away.

85
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,460
Mr. Bean sat and looked round the restaurant.

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,239
There were a lot of people in the room.

87
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,090
There was a man and a woman at the next table.

88
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,230
They ate and talked.

89
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,330
Suddenly, a waiter arrived at Mr. Bean's table
with a bottle of wine.

90
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,960
'Would you like to try the wine, sir?' he
said.

91
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,280
'Oh, yes please, ' said Mr. Bean.

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,520
The waiter put some wine in Mr. Bean's glass
and Mr. Bean had a drink.

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,310
It was very nice!

94
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,240
He smiled, and the waiter tried to put more
wine into the glass.

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,600
Of course, the waiter was right.

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,630
First, the customer tries his wine.

97
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,810
When he is happy with it, the waiter gives
him more wine.

98
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,000
But Mr. Bean didn't know this, and he quickly
put his hand across the glass.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,090
'No, thank you, ' he said.

100
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,520
'I don't drink wine when I'm driving.'

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,220
The waiter looked at him strangely - and walked
away.

102
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,840
He didn't say, 'Why did you try the wine when
you didn't want it, you stupid man!'

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,410
Mr. Bean took the knife from the table and
started to play with it.

104
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,910
He pretended to be a bad man.

105
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,889
He pretended to push the knife into somebody.

106
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,040
But he didn't really want to kill anybody,
of course.

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,210
It was a game.

108
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,919
The woman at the next table looked at him
angrily, and Mr. Bean quickly moved the knife.

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,080
Next, he hit the glasses and plate on his
table with it.

110
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,270
Ping, ping, ping they went!

111
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,460
And after a minute, he played the song 'Happy
Birthday' on the glasses.

112
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,570
He smiled and thought, 'I'm very clever!'

113
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,920
But the woman at the next table didn't think,
'That's clever!'

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,639
or 'Oh yes, that's funny!'

115
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,660
She thought, 'That man's really stupid!'

116
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,610
And she looked hard at Mr. Bean.

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,690
Mr. Bean put the knife down and looked at
his napkin.

118
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,610
'It's a very nice napkin, ' he thought.

119
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,729
The waiter saw Mr. Bean looking at his napkin.

120
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:23,229
He didn't say anything, but suddenly - flick!
- he opened it for Mr. Bean.

121
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,310
'That's clever, ' thought Mr. Bean.

122
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,970
'I'll try that!'

123
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,100
And he began to move his napkin.

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Flick!

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Flick!

126
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Flick!

127
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,440
Suddenly, the napkin flew out of his hand.

128
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,060
It flew across on to the next table.

129
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,810
The woman at the table looked round again.

130
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,759
But Mr. Bean pretended not to see her.

131
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,850
His face said, 'It's not my napkin!'

132
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,490
A minute later, the waiter arrived with his
food.

133
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,319
There was a large cover on the plate and Mr.
Bean couldn't see the food.

134
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,990
But he gave the waiter the money on the table.

135
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,520
Customers don't usually give a waiter money
when he arrives with the food.

136
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,090
But the waiter didn't say anything.

137
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,780
He took the money and put it in his jacket.

138
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,800
Mr. Bean was happy.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,250
'I'm doing everything right, ' he thought.

140
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,280
The waiter took the cover off the plate and
walked away.

141
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,610
Mr. Bean looked at the food in front of him.

142
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,210
He put his nose near the meat and smelled
it.

143
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,120
Then he put his ear next to it.

144
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,060
'What's this?' he thought.

145
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,710
He put some of the meat into his mouth.

146
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,919
Suddenly, the manager arrived at his table.

147
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,720
'Is everything all right, sir?' he asked.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,800
'Are you happy with everything?'

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,750
'Mmmmm, ' said Mr. Bean.

150
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,349
He smiled.

151
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,610
The manager smiled, too.

152
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,750
He walked away - and Mr. Bean's face changed.

153
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,280
There was no smile now.

154
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
'Aaagh!' he thought.

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,530
'They didn't cook this meat!'

156
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,880
But he had to eat it.

157
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,110
'I don't want people to think that I'm stupid,'
he thought.

158
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,500
'But I'll never ask for steak tartare again!

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,730
Never!'

160
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,930
He pushed his plate away.

161
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,550
But then the waiter went past his table.

162
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,310
'Is everything all right, sir?' he asked.

163
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,720
'Oh, yes,' said Mr. Bean.

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
He smiled.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,100
'Yes, everything's very nice, thank you.'

166
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,740
He smiled and pretended to eat some meat.

167
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,199
But the waiter went away before Mr. Bean put
it into his mouth.

168
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,069
'What can I do with it?' he thought.

169
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:40,639
'I can't eat this.

170
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,279
Where can I hide it?'

171
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,559
Then he had an idea.

172
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,560
Carefully, he put the meat into the mustard
pot and put the cover on it.

173
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
'Where can I put some now?' he thought.

174
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,069
'I can't eat it, so I've got to hide all of
it.

175
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,779
Oh, yes, the flowers!'

176
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,149
He took the flowers out of the vase.

177
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:09,019
But then the manager went past, so Mr. Bean
pretended to smell the flowers.

178
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,769
'Mmm, very nice!' he said.

179
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,610
The manager smiled and walked away.

180
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:22,170
Quickly, Mr. Bean put some meat into the vase
and pushed the flowers in on top of it.

181
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,679
He looked round the table.

182
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,470
'Where next?' he thought.

183
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,550
'Yes!

184
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,110
The bread!'

185
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,189
He took his knife and cut the bread roll.

186
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,660
Then he quickly ate the middle of it.

187
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,970
Now he could push some meat inside the roll.

188
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,480
He did this, then he put the roll down.

189
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,550
He looked at the meat on his plate.

190
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,000
'There's a lot of it, ' he thought.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,540
'Where can I hide it now?'

192
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,389
He looked at the small plate on the table.

193
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,010
Perhaps he could hide some meat under the
plate.

194
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,010
He looked round.

195
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,220
'Nobody's watching me, ' he thought.

196
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,970
So he took more meat from the big plate in
front of him, and put it under the small plate.

197
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,529
Then he pushed down hard with his hand.

198
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,439
The waiter walked past his table again.

199
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:15,350
Mr. Bean smiled at him and put his arm on
the plate.

200
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,319
After the waiter went away, he pushed down
on the small plate again.

201
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,360
'That's better, ' he thought.

202
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,189
'Now you can't see the meat.

203
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,329
Good.

204
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,850
But there's more meat.

205
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,730
Where can I hide it?'

206
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,160
He looked round the table.

207
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,619
'The sugar pot!' he thought.

208
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,399
'But it's got sugar in it.

209
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,569
What can I do?'

210
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:45,010
He thought quickly, then he put some sugar
into a wine glass.

211
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,569
Next, he put some of the meat into the sugar
pot.

212
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,689
Then he put the sugar from the wine glass
on top of it.

213
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:57,379
'Good!' he thought.

214
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,730
'Nobody can see it in there.

215
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,730
'

216
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,249
Suddenly, Mr. Bean could hear music.

217
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:07,730
'Where's that coming from?' he thought.

218
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,930
He looked round - and saw a man with a violin.

219
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,009
After a minute or two, the man came across
to Mr. Bean's table and played for him.

220
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,790
Mr. Bean smiled.

221
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,589
'This is nice, ' he thought.

222
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,489
Then the man saw Mr. Bean's birthday card,
and the music changed.

223
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,629
The man started to play 'Happy Birthday'!

224
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,160
The people at the other tables looked round
when they heard the song.

225
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,869
'Who's having a birthday?'

226
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:39,220
they thought.

227
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,399
Then they saw Mr. Bean and smiled at him.

228
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,509
Mr. Bean smiled back at them.

229
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,019
He pretended to eat some of the meat, but
he didn't put it into his mouth.

230
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,529
The man with the violin walked round Mr. Bean's
table and watched him.

231
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,399
He played his violin and waited for Mr. Bean
to eat the meat.

232
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,619
And he waited... and waited... and waited...

233
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:10,029
'I'll have to eat some,' thought Mr. Bean.

234
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,769
'He'll only go away when I eat it.

235
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,769
'

236
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,609
So he put the meat into his mouth.

237
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:20,720
And the man with the violin turned away to
the next table.

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,119
The meat was in Mr. Bean's mouth, but he didn't
want to eat it.

239
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,459
He wanted to put it somewhere.

240
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:28,819
But where?

241
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:31,809
He looked at the man with the violin.

242
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,509
He moved quickly.

243
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:38,040
He pulled open the back of the man's trousers
and opened his mouth.

244
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,769
The meat fell inside the trousers!

245
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,769
He smiled.

246
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,369
'That was clever, ' he thought.

247
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,560
The man with the violin moved round the next
table.

248
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,300
He played a song to the man and the woman.

249
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,379
The music was very beautiful.

250
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:58,079
They listened and drank their wine.

251
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,290
They watched the man with the violin, so their
eyes weren't on Mr. Bean.

252
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,540
Nobody's eyes were on Mr. Bean.

253
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,499
He saw this, and he had an idea.

254
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:12,930
Mr. Bean quickly took the woman's bag from
the floor.

255
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,489
He opened it and pushed some meat inside it.

256
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,929
Then he put the bag on the floor again.

257
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,049
But when he did this, he accidentally put
his foot out.

258
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:29,809
The waiter walked past with some plates of
food - and he fell over Mr. Bean's foot!

259
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,970
The plates fell on to Mr. Bean's table, and
on to the floor.

260
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,499
There was a loud CRASH!, and the people at
the other tables looked up quickly.

261
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,139
'What happened?'

262
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,470
they said.

263
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,069
Then they saw the waiter on the floor.

264
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:46,029
'Oh, dear!'

265
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,999
they said.

266
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,299
Now Mr. Bean had another idea.

267
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,059
Here was the answer to his problem!

268
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,179
He moved very quickly.

269
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,579
He pushed the meat from his plate on to the
table with the other food.

270
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:03,089
Then he pretended to be very angry.

271
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,019
'Look, you stupid man!' he said to the waiter.

272
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,949
'Oh, look at this!'

273
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,569
The waiter got up from the floor.

274
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,369
'I'm sorry, sir, ' he said.

275
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:17,180
'I'm really very sorry.

276
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
'

277
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,920
The manager arrived at the table.

278
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,759
'I'm very sorry, too, sir, ' he said.

279
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,680
'Oh, the food-!'

280
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,980
'Yes, it's everywhere!' said Mr. Bean.

281
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
'Look!

282
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,859
It's in the mustard pot.

283
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,790
It's in the bread roll.

284
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,769
It's in the vase of flowers.'

285
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,209
He took the woman's bag from the floor.

286
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,559
'And it's in here!'

287
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,309
He pulled open the back of the violin player's
trousers.

288
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,470
'And here!'

289
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,449
The waiter couldn't understand it.

290
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,839
'Go back to the kitchen, ' the manager told
him, and the waiter went away.

291
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,389
Then the manager turned to Mr. Bean.

292
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,990
'Please, sir, ' he said.

293
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,589
'Come with me.'

294
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:04,220
'What?' said Mr. Bean.

295
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,350
'Oh, yes, all right.'

296
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,519
The manager took Mr. Bean to a clean table.

297
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,470
'Sit here, sir, ' he said.

298
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,930
Mr. Bean sat down.

299
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,779
'Thank you, ' he said.

300
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,679
The manager opened Mr. Bean's napkin.

301
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,240
Then he got the birthday card from the other
table.

302
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,519
He put it on Mr. Bean's clean table.

303
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,769
'Thank you,' said Mr. Bean.

304
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,790
The man with the violin came across and played
'Happy Birthday' to him again.

305
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,079
Mr. Bean smiled.

306
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,369
Now everything was all right.

307
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,040
'Now I can start again, ' he thought.

308
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,689
'And this time I'll do everything right.'

309
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:50,499
The waiter arrived at Mr. Bean's table.

310
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,149
He put a plate in front of Mr. Bean.

311
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,959
The manager smiled and took off the cover.

312
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,999
Mr. Bean looked down.

313
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,089
And he stopped smiling.

314
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:09,119
There, in front of him, was a very large plate
- of steak tartare!

315
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:14,169
CHAPTER TWO
The Launderette

316
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,089
A lot of Mr. Bean's clothes were dirty.

317
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,879
'I'll go to the launderette this morning,
' he thought.

318
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,509
'I'll take the car.

319
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,509
'

320
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:30,129
He put his dirty clothes into a very large
black bag, and took the bag out to his car.

321
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,939
He put it inside.

322
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:36,449
Then he got in and drove to the launderette.

323
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:39,749
The launderette wasn't very busy that morning.

324
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,379
Before Mr. Bean arrived, there were only two
women there.

325
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,269
The younger woman was with the launderette
manager.

326
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:51,790
'I've got to wash a lot of clothes, ' the
young woman said to the manager.

327
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,110
'I'll want a big washing machine.'

328
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,059
'This is one of our bigger machines,' said
the manager.

329
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,049
'Use this.

330
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:01,049
'

331
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:02,819
At that minute, Mr. Bean arrived.

332
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:07,959
He had the black bag on his back, and he couldn't
get it through the launderette door.

333
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,170
'Oh!' he said.

334
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,240
He pulled and he pushed.

335
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,449
He pushed and he pulled.

336
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,660
In the end, he got the bag inside.

337
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,709
He took it across to one of the washing machines.

338
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,490
'Money,' he thought.

339
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,839
'I want two one-pound coins for the washing
machine.

340
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,839
'

341
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,639
He took two one-pound coins out of his jacket
and put them on the top of the machine.

342
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:40,350
But then Mr. Bean saw a note above the washing
machine: Machines now cost 3 pounds.

343
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,240
'Oh, no!'

344
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,309
thought Mr. Bean.

345
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:47,120
'Have I got another one-pound coin?'

346
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,090
He looked in his jacket and his trousers,
but he could only find a five-pence coin.

347
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,840
He put this on top of the washing machine.

348
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,000
Then Mr. Bean remembered something.

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,250
He did have another one-pound coin, but...

350
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,929
He looked round.

351
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:09,630
The young woman was next to the big washing
machine.

352
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,269
Mr. Bean saw her putting some clothes into
it.

353
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,929
The launderette manager was busy in his little
office.

354
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,900
'Nobody's watching me, ' thought Mr. Bean.

355
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,059
'Good.

356
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,059
'

357
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,610
He opened the front of his trousers.

358
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,269
Then he started to pull out some string.

359
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:34,340
The young woman turned suddenly and saw Mr.
Bean pulling the string out of his trousers.

360
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,940
'What is that man doing?' she thought.

361
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,279
Mr. Bean saw her looking and turned away quickly.

362
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,910
But now the older woman looked at him.

363
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,620
Her eyes opened wide.

364
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,320
'That's a strange man, ' the woman thought.

365
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,140
'He's got string inside his trousers!'

366
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,429
On the end of the string was some paper, and
inside the paper was a one-pound coin.

367
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,250
Mr. Bean smiled.

368
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,580
He took the coin out of the paper and put
it on the top of the washing machine.

369
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,900
Then he put the five-pence coin back into
his jacket.

370
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,950
Next, he opened the washing machine.

371
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,130
A man came into the launderette with a bag
of dirty clothes under his arm.

372
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,610
He was young and strong.

373
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,920
When he saw Mr. Bean, he smiled.

374
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,000
But it wasn't a nice smile.

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,870
He didn't say 'Hello' or 'Good morning'.

376
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,559
He pushed Mr. Bean away from the washing machine.

377
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,500
'What-!' began Mr. Bean.

378
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:44,710
Then the young man pushed Mr. Bean's one-pound
coins on to the next machine.

379
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,710
Mr. Bean was angry.

380
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:52,960
He turned round to speak angrily - but then
he saw the young man taking a white karate

381
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,100
suit out of his bag.

382
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,269
'A karate suit!'

383
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,269
thought Mr. Bean.

384
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,200
'So he can fight.

385
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,440
Perhaps I won't say anything.

386
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
'

387
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
The young man pushed his white karate suit
into the washing machine.

388
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,830
Then he put some money into the machine and
sat down on a chair.

389
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,419
He took a magazine out of his bag and began
to read.

390
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,760
Mr. Bean started to put his clothes into his
washing machine.

391
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,480
There were some pairs of underpants.

392
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,760
'Monday,' he said, and he put one pair into
the machine.

393
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,529
'Tuesday' He put the next pair into the machine.

394
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:34,759
'Thursday.

395
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,990
Friday.

396
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,230
Saturday.'

397
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,309
Three pairs went into the machine.

398
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,409
Mr. Bean stopped.

399
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,470
'Wednesday!' he thought.

400
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,029
'Where are Wednesday's underpants?

401
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,920
Oh, it's Wednesday today, and I'm wearing
them!'

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,750
What could he do?

403
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,390
He had to wash them, so he had to take them
off.

404
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,390
He looked round.

405
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,610
'Where can I go?' he thought.

406
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,090
There was a partition near the washing machines.

407
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,210
'I'll go behind that, ' he thought.

408
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,600
He started to walk to the partition, but the
young man put his legs across the floor.

409
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,750
He wanted to make Mr. Bean angry.

410
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,590
But Mr. Bean remembered the karate suit.

411
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,820
The man could fight!

412
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,330
He walked round the young man's legs and said
nothing.

413
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,000
He went behind the partition and carefully
took off his brown trousers.

414
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,389
The young woman put some of her clothes into
one of the very big washing machines.

415
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:45,179
The other clothes were on the top of a smaller
machine near the partition.

416
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,039
She didn't watch her clothes very carefully.

417
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,909
She didn't see Mr. Bean put a hand round the
partition.

418
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:58,570
And she didn't see him put his brown trousers
down with her clothes.

419
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,630
Mr. Bean took off his underpants - Wednesday's
underpants.

420
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,840
Then he put his hand round the partition.

421
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,289
He took something - but it wasn't his brown
trousers.

422
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,600
It was a long brown skirt.

423
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,899
Mr. Bean put on the skirt and came out from
behind the partition.

424
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,250
He walked back to his washing machine.

425
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,830
The young woman took the brown trousers from
the top of the smaller washing machine.

426
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,750
She didn't look at them.

427
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,259
She put them into the big machine.

428
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:36,990
Next, she shut the door of the machine and
took a magazine.

429
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,540
Then she sat down on a chair near the dryers
and started to read.

430
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,679
She had her back to Mr. Bean, so she didn't
see him wearing her skirt.

431
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,840
Mr. Bean put his Wednesday underpants into
his washing machine.

432
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,130
Then he closed the door and put in his three
one-pound coins.

433
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,809
He sat down on a chair - and saw the skirt!

434
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,409
'Oh, no!' he thought.

435
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:05,970
'What's this?

436
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,540
A skirt?

437
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,899
Where are my trousers?'

438
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:15,179
The young man walked past and Mr. Bean tried
to hide the skirt with his hands.

439
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,710
'I don't want him to see me in this skirt,'
he thought.

440
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,399
'What will he think?'

441
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:26,720
The young man went across to a machine on
the wall and bought a cup of conditioner.

442
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,960
Mr. Bean got up and went back to the partition.

443
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,659
He looked at the washing machine next to it
and remembered the young woman's clothes.

444
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:41,330
'She put my trousers in the big washing machine
with her things!' he thought.

445
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,960
He went across to the big washing machine
and tried to open it.

446
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,679
But he couldn't do it.

447
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,700
'I'll have to wait, ' he thought, and he walked
back to his chair.

448
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,019
The young man put his cup of conditioner on
the top of his washing machine.

449
00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,690
Then he looked at Mr. Bean - and saw the skirt.

450
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,980
He started to laugh.

451
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,309
Mr. Bean looked away quickly.

452
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,580
He got his black bag - and a pair of underpants
fell out of it.

453
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,710
'Oh!

454
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,919
Sunday's underpants!' he said.

455
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,249
He tried to stop his washing machine and open
the door.

456
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,509
But the machine didn't stop.

457
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,200
'What can I do?' he thought.

458
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,039
He looked down at the skirt.

459
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,240
'I know!

460
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,770
I'll wear Sunday's underpants under this skirt!

461
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,969
That's a good idea.

462
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:35,969
'

463
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:40,659
He looked round, then went across to the conditioner
machine, away from the other people.

464
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,960
Carefully, he started to put on Sunday's underpants.

465
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,580
He put his feet into them and - suddenly,
he couldn't pull them up.

466
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,610
He couldn't move them.

467
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,690
There was a strange foot on them!

468
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,950
It was the young man's foot.

469
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,250
Mr. Bean turned round and saw the young man
laughing at him.

470
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,280
Mr. Bean wanted to shout, 'Go away, you stupid
man!'

471
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,730
but he was too afraid.

472
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:16,960
After a minute, the young man laughed again
and went back to his chair.

473
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,940
Mr. Bean quickly pulled up Sunday's underpants.

474
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
He was angry.

475
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,749
'I don't like people laughing at me,' he thought,
and he looked at the young man.

476
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:30,710
'What can I do to him?

477
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,419
I can't fight him.

478
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:34,650
He's too strong.

479
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,650
'

480
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,870
Then he had an idea.

481
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,940
There was a coffee machine next to the machine
for conditioner.

482
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,260
Mr. Bean went across to it and got a cup of
black coffee.

483
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,789
He smiled and walked back to his washing machine
with the coffee.

484
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,940
The young man's eyes were on his magazine.

485
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,840
He didn't look at Mr. Bean or the washing
machine.

486
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
'Now!'

487
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,909
thought Mr. Bean

488
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:08,090
And he quickly changed the young man's cup
of conditioner for his cup of black coffee.

489
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,929
Then he carried the cup of conditioner to
his chair and sat down.

490
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:14,929
He smiled.

491
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,120
'That will teach him a lesson,' he thought.

492
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,299
After a minute, the young man stood up and
went to his machine.

493
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,039
He had to put the conditioner into it now.

494
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,990
He stood next to the machine and laughed at
Mr. Bean's skirt.

495
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:36,780
So he didn't look at the cup when he put the
'conditioner' into the top of his washing

496
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
machine.

497
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,080
But, of course, it wasn't conditioner.

498
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,840
It was black coffee.

499
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,669
Mr. Bean tried not to laugh.

500
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:52,480
The young man sat down in his chair again
and looked across at his washing machine.

501
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,799
There was a window in the door, and the young
man could see his white karate suit going

502
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,970
round and round in the water.

503
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,610
But the suit wasn't white now.

504
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,309
It was brown!

505
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:08,120
'What-!?' he shouted.

506
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,289
He jumped up.

507
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,200
He ran across to the cup and looked inside
it.

508
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,320
Then he put it to his nose and smelled it.

509
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,970
'Coffee!' he shouted.

510
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,039
Then he looked across at Mr. Bean.

511
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,739
'Did you...

512
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:24,739
?'

513
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:29,749
Mr. Bean didn't answer, but his face said,
'Who, me?'

514
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:32,369
He pretended to drink his cup of 'coffee'.

515
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:37,149
But it wasn't coffee, it was conditioner.

516
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:40,360
The young man went to find the launderette
manager.

517
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,470
Mr. Bean stopped drinking and said, 'Aaaagh!'

518
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,039
The young man showed the brown karate suit
to the launderette manager.

519
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,509
'What's wrong, sir?' said the manager.

520
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:59,520
'This karate suit was white when I came in
here, ' said the young man.

521
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,590
'Now look at it!'

522
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,679
'What did you do to it?' said the manager.

523
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,679
'Me?

524
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,110
I didn't do anything to it,' said the young
man, angrily.

525
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,129
He pulled the manager across to his washing
machine.

526
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:14,419
'This is your machine.

527
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,220
Is that right?'

528
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,999
'Y-yes, ' said the manager.

529
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:21,740
The young man showed him the karate suit again.

530
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,080
'This cost me two hundred pounds!' he said.

531
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,269
'What are you going to do about it?'

532
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,799
'Er - will you come to my office please, sir?'
said the manager.

533
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,019
'We can talk about it there.

534
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,019
'

535
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,019
***

536
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,100
Mr. Bean sat opposite a large dryer.

537
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,159
His underpants and other things were in the
machine.

538
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,530
They were clean now, and nearly dry.

539
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,890
Mr. Bean waited.

540
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,519
After a minute, the dryer stopped.

541
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,190
He got up and opened the door.

542
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,980
Then he started to take out his clothes.

543
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,169
A minute or two later, the young woman came
to the next dryer and started to take out

544
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:04,169
her clothes.

545
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,570
They were dry, too.

546
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,320
'Perhaps my trousers are in there!'

547
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,350
thought Mr. Bean.

548
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,179
The young woman took some clothes out of the
machine and put them into a bag.

549
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:21,059
Then she went back to the big washing machine
for her other clothes.

550
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,640
Mr. Bean moved quickly.

551
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,519
He started to look through her clothes for
his trousers, but he couldn't find them.

552
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,850
'Where are they?' he thought.

553
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,710
'They're here somewhere.

554
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,570
Wait a minute!

555
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,840
Perhaps she left them in the dryer.'

556
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,110
So he looked inside it.

557
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,929
First, he put his head into the machine.

558
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,869
'I can't see anything,' he thought.

559
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:46,869
'It's too dark.'

560
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:51,529
Next, he climbed into the machine.

561
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:54,580
The young woman was busy at the big washing
machine.

562
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,070
She didn't see Mr. Bean climb into the dryer.

563
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,500
Then she took something out of the big washing
machine.

564
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,649
Her eyes opened wide.

565
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,289
'What's this?'

566
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:06,289
she thought.

567
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:08,389
'A pair of trousers.

568
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,080
I haven't got any brown trousers.'

569
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,840
She threw them on to one of the other washing
machines, then she took her clothes across

570
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,760
to the dryer.

571
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,470
Mr. Bean was inside the dryer.

572
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,070
'Where are my trousers?' he thought.

573
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:32,399
Suddenly, the woman's washing began to fly
into the machine - a skirt, a dress and some

574
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,679
shirts.

575
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,820
'What-?' began Mr. Bean.

576
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,640
Then the dryer door shut with a BANG!

577
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,700
'Oh, no!'

578
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,090
thought Mr. Bean.

579
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,980
He turned and climbed back to the door.

580
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,119
'Help!' he shouted through the window in the
door.

581
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,870
'There's somebody in here!'

582
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,509
But the woman couldn't hear him.

583
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:00,309
She took a pound coin and put it into the
dryer.

584
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:03,460
Mr. Bean hit the window in the dryer door.

585
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
Bang!

586
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
Bang!

587
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,190
But nobody heard him.

588
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,499
'I can't get out!' he shouted.

589
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:14,440
Suddenly, it was very hot inside the dryer.

590
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,039
There was a noise - and the machine started!

591
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,940
The clothes began to go round and round!

592
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,460
And Mr. Bean began to go round and round...
and round... and round...

593
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,659
- THE END -
