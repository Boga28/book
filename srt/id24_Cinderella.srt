1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:04,040
Cinderella is a pretty girl.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,800
She's got blue eyes and blonde, curly hair.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,309
She's always happy.

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:18,300
She likes singing and playing with her pet
cat and the mice in the kitchen.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,670
She lives in a big house with her two sisters.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,050
Her sisters are very ugly!

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,580
They've got big noses and big, ugly feet!

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,630
They don't like Cinderella, and she has to
do all the work in the house.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,250
They throw their clothes on the floor.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,930
'Pick up our clothes!'

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,930
they say.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,900
They shout at Cinderella.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,670
'Clean the kitchen!'

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,829
'Wash the clothes!'

15
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,809
'Cook the dinner!'

16
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,200
One day Cinderella is in the kitchen.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
She's washing the plates.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,930
The sun is shining and Cinderella is happy.

19
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,970
She's looking out of the window and singing
with the birds.

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:24,170
Blackie, her cat, is playing with his friends,
the little mice.

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,750
Goldie is Cinderella's goldfish.

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,790
He's swimming in his bowl and listening to
the birds singing.

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,660
'Cinderella!

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,540
Cinderella!'

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,520
say her sisters.

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,439
'Come here!

27
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,900
Quickly!'

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,729
Cinderella runs upstairs into the living room.

29
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,170
'Here I am!'

30
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,170
she says.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,890
'Look at this.

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,010
We've got an invitation from the king.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,079
An invitation to the ball at the Palace!'

34
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,039
'An invitation to the ball!' says Cinderella.

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,619
'That's wonderful.'

36
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,280
'Yes!' say the sisters.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,570
'We can wear beautiful dresses and we can
dance with Prince Charming!'

38
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,630
'Can I come to the ball?' says Cinderella.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,430
'You?'

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,430
say the sisters.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,270
'Come to the ball?

42
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,470
No.

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,430
You can't come to the ball.

44
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,310
You haven't got a dress!'

45
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,310
On the day of the ball Cinderella is very
busy.

46
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,710
The ugly sisters want Cinderella to do everything.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,020
'Cinderella!

48
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,050
Come here and help me with my dress.'

49
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,130
'Cinderella!

50
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,060
Come here and help me with my hair.'

51
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,060
'Cinderella!

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,820
Go and find my blue shoes.'

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
'Cinderella!

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,819
Go and find my yellow bag.'

55
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:21,900
'Cinderella!

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,490
Where's my necklace?'

57
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,580
'Cinderella!

58
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,840
Where's my ring?'

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,930
'Cinderella!

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,010
Cinderella!

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,099
Cinderella!

62
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:36,270
Quickly, quickly, quickly...It's time to go!

63
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,950
'Don't cry, Cinderella,' says Blackie.

64
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,210
'I want to go to the ball,' says Cinderella.

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:52,700
'You can go to the ball,' says a beautiful
woman.

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,430
'Who are you?' says Cinderella.

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,810
'I'm your Fairy Godmother,' says the beautiful
woman.

68
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:12,200
'Cinderella, go into the garden and find a
nice, big pumpkin,' says the Fairy Godmother.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,620
'Come here, Blackie.

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,459
Let's put Goldie here on the floor...

71
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,090
and... oh, yes!

72
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,430
Six little white mice!

73
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,759
Perfect!' says the Fairy Godmother.

74
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:36,460
The Fairy Godmother waves her magic wand and
says 'ABRACADABRA!'

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,990
The pumpkin is now a beautiful coach.

76
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,889
Goldie is now a footman.

77
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:47,970
Blackie is now a coachman.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:55,539
And the six white mice are now six beautiful
white horses!

79
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,770
The Fairy Godmother waves her wand again.

80
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:07,499
Cinderella's old grey dress is now a wonderful
new dress, and on her feet there are pretty

81
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:10,680
glass shoes.

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,979
'Now you can go to the ball, Cinderella,'
says the Fairy Godmother.

83
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:22,229
'But, you must be home before midnight.'

84
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,020
At the palace there are a lot of people.

85
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,110
They're in the ballroom, talking and laughing
and dancing.

86
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,199
Everyone is happy.

87
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,360
The King and Queen are enjoying the ball.

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,249
'Who is that beautiful princess?'

89
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,180
says one of the ugly sisters.

90
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,789
'I don't know,' says the other ugly sister.

91
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:55,370
'Look, Prince Charming is dancing with her!'

92
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:04,319
Prince Charming likes Cinderella, and they
dance and dance and dance all evening.

93
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,759
Dong!

94
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,199
Dong!

95
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,800
Cinderella looks at the clock.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,029
It's midnight!

97
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,860
'I must go!'

98
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,860
she says.

99
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,589
Cinderella runs out of the ballroom and down
the steps.

100
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,039
Prince Charming runs out of the ballroom.

101
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,840
'Don't go!' he says.

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,770
'Please, come here!'

103
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,210
But Cinderella isn't there.

104
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,089
It's midnight, and she's running home.

105
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,990
'What's this?' says Prince Charming.

106
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,960
He looks on the steps and sees Cinderella's
glass shoe.

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,849
'I can go to every house in the town,' he
says.

108
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:57,150
'I can ask every girl in the town to put on
this shoe.

109
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,330
I can find the beautiful princess!'

110
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,349
'Prince Charming is here!

111
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,459
Prince Charming is here!'

112
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,389
say the ugly sisters.

113
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,550
'Go away.

114
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,251
Go into the kitchen, Cinderella.

115
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,349
The glass shoe isn't yours.

116
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,479
You can't see Prince Charming.

117
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,719
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

118
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,800
Go!

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,879
Go!

120
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,969
Go!'

121
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:31,139
The ugly sisters put on the glass shoe.

122
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,999
They have very big, ugly feet!

123
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:38,830
And the shoe is very small...

124
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,990
Cinderella opens the door.

125
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,279
'Can I put on the shoe?'

126
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,719
she says.

127
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,479
'GO AWAY!'

128
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,389
say the ugly sisters.

129
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:54,309
'No, wait!' says Prince Charming.

130
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:59,050
'Come here and put on the shoe.'

131
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,759
Cinderella puts on the shoe.

132
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,909
The shoe is yours!' says Prince Charming.

133
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,929
'You are the beautiful princess!'

134
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,819
'I'm not a princess.

135
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,719
I'm Cinderella,' she says.

136
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:20,469
'But the shoe is mine'.

137
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:26,199
Prince Charming and Cinderella have a beautiful
wedding in the garden at the Palace.

138
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,099
All the people from the town come to the wedding.

139
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:40,519
It's a beautiful sunny day, and Prince Charming
and Cinderella are very happy.

140
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,410
'Can we be friends now?' says Cinderella to
her ugly sisters.

141
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,250
'You are a good, kind girl, Cinderella,' they
say.

142
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,740
'We want to be your friends.'

143
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,520
'Good!' says Cinderella.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,499
And they all live happily ever after!

145
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:02,699
- THE END -
