00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,989
CHAPTER ONE
Life Cycles

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:11,330
There are millions of different species of
animal in the world.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,359
Some animals, like the blue whale, are very
big.

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,089
Others are so small that we almost can't see
them.

5
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:27,820
These animals all have very different life
cycles.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,320
Animal Groups

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,430
Scientists put animals into groups.

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,730
The animals in each group are the same in
many ways, and they often have very similar

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,270
life cycles.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,070
The two biggest animal groups are invertebrates
and vertebrates.

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,820
Invertebrates are animals that have no backbone.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,390
More than 95% of the animal species in the
world are invertebrates, and most of them

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,580
are very small.

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,460
There are many different groups of invertebrates.

15
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,770
The biggest group is called arthropods.

16
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:22,570
Insects, spiders, and animals like crabs that
have a hard shell, are all arthropods.

17
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,380
Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,450
Only a few percent of the animals in the world
are vertebrates, and most of them are much

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,530
bigger than invertebrates.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,979
Because of this, we see vertebrates more often
than invertebrates.

21
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:52,350
Scientists put vertebrates into five big groups
- they are called fish, amphibians, reptiles,

22
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,819
birds, and mammals.

23
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,459
Staying Alive

24
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,280
All animals need to find food to stay alive.

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,490
Some animals are carnivores.

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,510
This means that they eat other animals.

27
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:22,290
Herbivores eat plants, and omnivores eat plants
and animals.

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,430
There are many dangers for animals.

29
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:33,310
They have to keep safe from predators - animals
that hunt and eat other animals.

30
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,090
People hunt birds and other animals.

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,709
People also cut down trees and build houses
and roads on land.

32
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,260
When they do this, animals lose their homes
and their food.

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:55,430
Many animals also become sick or die because
of pollution of the land, oceans, rivers,

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,689
and air.

35
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:01,810
Life is very dangerous for animals.

36
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:10,239
Many animals die before they are old enough
to produce young.

37
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,060
Different animals live for different amounts
of time.

38
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,549
A Galapagos tortoise can live for 150 years,
but an adult mayfly usually lives for just

39
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,790
a few hours.

40
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,000
Breeding

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,270
Most species of animal have males and females.

42
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,700
Males produce sperm, and females produce eggs.

43
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,209
Baby animals are made when sperm from the
male joins together with an egg from the female.

44
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,540
This is called fertilization.

45
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,400
Some animals give birth to baby animals.

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,040
Other animals, like reptiles and birds, lay
eggs.

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,459
Their babies hatch - they break the egg open
and come out.

48
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,040
Most reptiles and birds care for their babies.

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,500
Most insects and fish do not care for their
eggs or their babies.

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,150
All mammals care for their babies and feed
them milk.

51
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,100
Some big mammals stay with their babies for
many years.

52
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,710
CHAPTER TWO
Insects

53
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:42,810
Insects are small animals like butterflies,
beetles, flies, bees, and ants.

54
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,949
There are more than a million species of insect
in the world.

55
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:55,280
Many insects change in amazing ways during
their life.

56
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,210
Larvae and Nymphs

57
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,410
Almost all insects start their life in an
egg.

58
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,970
The young insect grows inside the egg and
then it hatches.

59
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:16,400
Some baby insects, like bees, look very different
from their parents.

60
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,030
These baby insects are called larvae.

61
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,430
Other baby insects, like locusts, look more
like their parents.

62
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,110
These baby insects are called nymphs.

63
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,259
Larvae and nymphs are very small when they
hatch.

64
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,259
Growing Up

65
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:46,870
A young insect eats a lot of food and grows
very quickly.

66
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,330
It has a hard cover, called an exoskeleton.

67
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,039
When the exoskeleton is too small for the
young insect, it breaks open and comes off.

68
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,699
A new exoskeleton grows under the old one.

69
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,949
This is called molting.

70
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,910
Some insects grow wings that get bigger every
time they molt.

71
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:21,270
After the insect molts for the last time,
it becomes an adult that can fly and produce

72
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,020
young.

73
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,740
This is called incomplete metamorphosis.

74
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,840
Most insects change by complete metamorphosis.

75
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,680
When the larva is ready to change into an
adult, its exoskeleton comes off.

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,280
Under the exoskeleton there's a pupa - it's
like a closed case.

77
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,130
Inside the pupa, an amazing change happens.

78
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:59,250
The larva changes into an adult that looks
completely different!

79
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,110
Finding a Mate

80
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,120
When insects become adults, they are ready
to breed and produce young.

81
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,919
First they need to find a mate.

82
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:23,560
Male crickets, cicadas, and grasshoppers sing
to find females that they can mate with.

83
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,400
Female butterflies and moths produce special
chemicals called pheromones that have a strong

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,580
smell.

85
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:39,720
Male butterflies and moths can smell the pheromones
from up to 2 kilometers away.

86
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,250
They then fly toward the smell.

87
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,320
Male fireflies make special lights in their
body.

88
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,180
They turn these lights on and off so that
female fireflies know that they are looking

89
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,099
for a mate.

90
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,729
Laying Eggs

91
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:10,819
Some insects only lay a few eggs during their
life, but others lay thousands.

92
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,550
Many insects are careful to keep their eggs
safe.

93
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,660
The cardinal beetle makes a hole in dead wood
and lays her eggs inside.

94
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,870
When the eggs hatch, you can't see the larvae
very well.

95
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,910
Cockroaches lay their eggs in a special case,
and beetle eggs are usually yellow, green,

96
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:41,760
or black so that they are camouflaged.

97
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:50,339
When these insect eggs hatch, the life cycle
starts again!

98
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:58,310
Termite queens lay up to 30,000 eggs every
day!

99
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,010
CHAPTER THREE
Other Invertebrates

100
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:10,350
There are many other groups of invertebrate,
and they all have very different life cycles.

101
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:21,870
Did you know that earthworms, octopuses, spiders,
and lobsters are all invertebrates?

102
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,950
Earthworms

103
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,480
All earthworms lay eggs, because they are
hermaphrodites.

104
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,700
This means that they all have male parts that
produce sperm and female parts that produce

105
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,620
eggs, but they cannot fertilize their own
eggs.

106
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:50,070
After earthworms mate, their bodies make special
rings with eggs inside.

107
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:56,310
The ring moves forward over the worm's body
and then it comes off.

108
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,470
Then the ends of the ring join together.

109
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:07,180
The eggs hatch after about three months, and
young earthworms can mate when they are 12

110
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,329
months old.

111
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:13,370
Octopuses

112
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:20,610
Baby octopuses live in the open ocean at first,
but when they grow, they move down to the

113
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,720
bottom of the ocean.

114
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,070
Here they live on their own in dens.

115
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,329
Octopuses are ready to mate when they are
one or two years old.

116
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:42,579
Some female octopuses lay about 200,000 eggs,
and many put them in strings from the top

117
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,570
of their dens.

118
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:52,190
The females keep the eggs safe from predators
and they carefully push water over them so

119
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,940
that they get enough oxygen.

120
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,660
The octopuses do not eat for up to ten months
when they are caring for their eggs.

121
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:10,970
After the eggs hatch, the female octopuses
die.

122
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,950
Spiders

123
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:22,839
Spiders produce silk, and they use it to make
webs, where they catch flies and other insects.

124
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:29,760
Most species of spider also put lots of silk
around their eggs to make a special cover,

125
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,450
called a cocoon.

126
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,810
Most spider eggs hatch after a few days or
weeks.

127
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:46,040
The baby spiders, or spider lings, grow fast
and they molt a few times.

128
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:54,320
They can soon make their own webs and catch
their own food.

129
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,260
Many spiders die after they lay their eggs.

130
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,230
Some spider lings eat their mother's body
after she dies!

131
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,230
Lobsters

132
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:16,399
A female lobster can lay up to 10,000 eggs,
but only about ten of them will live.

133
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:24,079
The female lobster carries her eggs hidden
under her tail for almost a year.

134
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,100
When they are ready to hatch, she lifts her
tail and they float away.

135
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,050
When the eggs hatch, the larvae move to the
top of the ocean.

136
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:45,200
Life here is very dangerous because of predators
and difficult currents.

137
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,870
Lobster larvae look very different from adult
lobsters.

138
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,089
When they are about one month old, the larvae
move to the bottom of the ocean.

139
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:05,829
They molt about 25 times before they become
adults.

140
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:09,510
Lobsters often eat their old shell after molting.

141
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,360
This helps their new shell to become hard.

142
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,050
CHAPTER FOUR
Fish

143
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,110
Fish are vertebrates that are cold-blooded.

144
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:32,180
This means that their body is as hot or cold
as the water around them.

145
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:41,250
All fish live and breathe in water, and most
baby fish hatch from eggs.

146
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,810
Eggs

147
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,240
Female fish can lay hundreds of eggs.

148
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,430
Inside every egg there's a bag of food called
the yolk.

149
00:13:53,430 --> 00:14:01,620
The unborn baby fish eats the yolk, so that
it can grow bigger and stronger.

150
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,959
Fish often try to hide their eggs because
many other animals like to eat fish eggs.

151
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,149
Female seahorses lay their eggs into a special
pouch on the male's front, where they stay

152
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,900
safe until they are ready to hatch.

153
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,360
Some species of shark lay their eggs in a
hard egg case to keep the eggs safe until

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,130
they hatch.

155
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,259
Young Fish

156
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:39,079
When young fish hatch, the yolk bag is still
stuck to their body.

157
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,140
The young fish use this as food at first.

158
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,170
Life is very dangerous for young fish.

159
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,790
Most of them don't have fins, so they can't
swim well.

160
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,480
They often float into colder water or places
where there's no food.

161
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:08,380
Also, many predators, like seals, birds, frogs,
and other fish, hunt them.

162
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,779
This is why fish lay so many eggs.

163
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:20,470
A large female tuna fish can lay up to six
million eggs at one time, but only about two

164
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:26,779
of these will grow into adult tuna!

165
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,440
Growing Up

166
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,410
Most fish never see their parents because
they swim away after they have laid their

167
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,490
eggs.

168
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,630
The young fish have to find food for themselves
so that they can grow bigger.

169
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:49,009
They eat small plants and insect eggs or larvae.

170
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:56,240
Most small fish grow into adults just a few
months after hatching, but whale sharks do

171
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,899
not grow into adults until they are 25 years
old!

172
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:09,589
The whale shark is the biggest fish in the
world.

173
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:17,269
An adult whale shark can be about 12 meters
long and it can weigh more than 21 metric

174
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,259
tons.

175
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,259
Breeding

176
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:28,089
Fish need to find mates so that they can breed.

177
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:35,100
When the male three-spined stickleback is
ready to breed, he builds a nest.

178
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,350
Part of his body changes to a red color.

179
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:45,690
Females see his bright colors and they lay
their eggs in his nest.

180
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,209
Many fish go back to the same place to breed
every year.

181
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:59,550
Salmon live in the ocean, but to breed, they
swim back to the rivers where they hatched.

182
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,460
Some salmon travel hundreds of kilometers
up rivers, and sometimes they have to jump

183
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,250
up waterfalls.

184
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:18,400
They change color from silver to red when
they are swimming back to their breeding places.

185
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,770
CHAPTER FIVE
Amphibians

186
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:29,180
Like fish, amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates.

187
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:35,380
Most amphibians live for some of their life
in water and for some of their life on land.

188
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,080
Salamanders, toads, and frogs are all amphibians.

189
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,520
Metamorphosis

190
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,380
All amphibians have two different parts of
life.

191
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,080
At first they are larvae that breathe in water
through special gills.

192
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Then they change into adults with lungs.

193
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,740
This change is called metamorphosis.

194
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,540
Usually, amphibians live in water for the
first part of their life and on land for the

195
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,940
second part.

196
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,890
Some salamanders live in water all the time.

197
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,130
Eggs and Larvae

198
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,620
Amphibians often lay thousands of eggs.

199
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,140
The eggs have a sticky cover, and they float
in water.

200
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:41,170
Most amphibians do not care for their eggs,
but the male midwife toad carries them on

201
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,480
his back until they are ready to hatch.

202
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,290
The young that hatch from eggs are called
larvae, but young frogs and toads are also

203
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,440
called tadpoles.

204
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,820
At first, tadpoles don't have legs or feet
and they breathe through gills.

205
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,030
It's easy for predators to catch and eat eggs
and tadpoles.

206
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:16,100
Frogs can lay about 2,000 eggs, but probably
only 5% live to become adults.

207
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:24,060
The male Darwin's frog keeps his tadpoles
safe and wet in his throat, until they are

208
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,980
big enough to swim away.

209
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,950
Becoming Adults

210
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:39,551
When amphibians begin to change into adults,
they grow lungs inside their body and their

211
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:42,090
gills close.

212
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,200
At the same time, most amphibians grow legs
and feet.

213
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,070
An adult frog looks completely different from
a tadpole!

214
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:00,420
Most adult amphibians can breathe through
their skin and their lungs!

215
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:08,700
They can only breathe through their skin if
it's wet, so most amphibians live near water.

216
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,880
Amphibians are cold-blooded, so when it gets
very cold they have no energy.

217
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,980
Some amphibians in colder countries hibernate
for the winter.

218
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:44,230
They hide in a safe, wet place and go into
a special, long sleep.

219
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,470
Breeding

220
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:53,800
Most amphibians go to wet places like ponds,
lakes, or rivers to breed, because their eggs

221
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,080
and larvae live in water.

222
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,980
Many go back to the same place every year,
and some go back to the pond or stream where

223
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,190
they were born.

224
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,810
Male frogs croak and shout to tell the females
that they are ready to breed.

225
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,810
They push their throats out so that their
calls are louder.

226
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:25,890
When the female has chosen a mate, she lays
her eggs in the water, and the male covers

227
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,790
them with sperm.

228
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,860
CHAPTER SIX
Reptiles

229
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:42,030
Reptiles are cold-blooded, and their skin
is dry and covered with special scales.

230
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:52,590
Lizards, snakes, crocodiles, alligators, and
turtles are all reptiles.

231
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:58,390
Some live on land and some live in water.

232
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,640
Eggs

233
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:09,300
Most reptiles hatch from eggs, but a few are
born as living animals.

234
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:14,050
Females lay their eggs in a warm, wet place.

235
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:21,460
They usually lay a lot of eggs, but many eggs
are eaten by predators.

236
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,560
Most reptiles lay their eggs and then they
leave them, but pythons put their body around

237
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,680
their eggs to keep them warm.

238
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,170
Alligators make a big nest from mud and leaves.

239
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,180
They lay their eggs and stay near the nest.

240
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:48,250
They don't eat for weeks when they are keeping
their eggs safe.

241
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,330
Growing Up

242
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:58,090
Crocodiles and alligators are very good parents
after their eggs hatch.

243
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:05,550
The female Nile crocodile is very careful
- she puts her babies inside her mouth to

244
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,350
carry them to water.

245
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,640
She stays near them to keep them safe for
up to two months.

246
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,100
When snakes and lizards grow, they get too
big for their skin.

247
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,590
The old skin comes off and there's a new one
underneath.

248
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,520
This is called sloughing.

249
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:38,030
Most snakes lose their old skin three or four
times every year.

250
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,810
Breeding

251
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:45,490
When reptiles are ready to breed, they have
to find a mate.

252
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,290
Male crocodiles lift their head up and make
a loud sound.

253
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:58,160
They also blow bubbles in the water so that
females will see and hear them.

254
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,580
Snakes find their mate by smell.

255
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,790
The females leave a special smell that the
male follows.

256
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:14,510
Other male reptiles, like monitor lizards,
fight each other for a mate.

257
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:23,130
The females choose the winner of the fight
because he's the strongest.

258
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,160
Some whiptail lizards can produce young without
mating!

259
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,640
The eggs are not fertilized, but they still
hatch.

260
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,500
Keeping Safe

261
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,830
Reptiles are in danger from many predators,
and they have lots of ways of keeping safe.

262
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:51,510
If a predator catches a lizard by its tail,
the lizard can break its tail off and escape.

263
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,890
It then grows a new tail.

264
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:03,460
The stinkpot turtle makes a horrible smell
from its legs to make predators go away.

265
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,250
Many reptiles also use camouflage to keep
safe.

266
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:16,890
Some chameleons can change color so that predators
do not see them, and the leaf-tailed gecko

267
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:24,270
can hide easily because its body looks like
a leaf.

268
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,870
CHAPTER SEVEN
Birds

269
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:36,720
There are about 9,000 different species of
bird, and they all lay eggs.

270
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,990
Baby birds called chicks come from eggs.

271
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,610
Birds are the only animals that have feathers.

272
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:53,000
All birds have wings and most birds can fly.

273
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,220
Courtship

274
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,790
Courtship is when male birds try to find female
birds that they can mate with.

275
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,850
Male birds do many different things to find
a mate.

276
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,610
Some males show females their colors.

277
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,600
The male frigate bird pushes his red throat
out like a balloon.

278
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,640
The blue-footed booby shows his big blue feet.

279
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,910
Songbirds sing for their females, and the
bower bird builds a special place with twigs

280
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:38,100
and puts bright colored things in it so that
it looks pretty.

281
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,460
Nests

282
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:47,010
Birds work very hard to build nests - special
homes where they can keep their eggs and chicks

283
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,820
safe and warm.

284
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,970
They find grass, mud, and twigs, and they
push them together.

285
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,820
Many birds build nests in high places like
trees and cliffs.

286
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,400
Others build them on the ground.

287
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:14,590
These birds are usually brown and speckled,
so they are well camouflaged.

288
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,870
Eggs

289
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,990
The female bird lays her eggs in the nest.

290
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,550
Then the female or the male sits on the eggs
to keep them warm.

291
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:35,380
When the chick is ready to hatch, it breaks
the shell with a special 'tooth' on its beak.

292
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,100
Cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds' nests.

293
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:47,770
When the baby cuckoo hatches, it pushes the
other eggs or chicks out of the nest so that

294
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,850
it can have more food.

295
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:58,920
It often grows much, much bigger than the
adult bird that is feeding it!

296
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:07,110
Ostrich eggs are the biggest bird eggs, and
they can weight about 2 kilograms.

297
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:13,020
If you stand on one, it will not break!

298
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,210
Chicks

299
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:22,010
Many chicks have no feathers, and they can't
see or move when they hatch, but some can

300
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,410
run, swim, and find food.

301
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:35,580
Birds feed their chicks and keep them safe
until they can care for themselves.

302
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,950
Birds often have to fly to and from the nest
hundreds of times a day to bring enough food

303
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,980
for their chicks.

304
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,420
Growing Up

305
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:58,980
Some small birds can fly just two weeks after
they hatch, but bigger birds take longer.

306
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:08,290
Chicks watch their parents and learn to fly,
feed, sing, and keep safe.

307
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:15,990
Some baby birds do not become adults for months
or even years.

308
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,170
Many birds that migrate every year have to
make long, dangerous journeys when they are

309
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,270
still very young.

310
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,900
These birds fly to warmer places for winter
and come back to their breeding places for

311
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,870
summer.

312
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,140
CHAPTER EIGHT
Mammals

313
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,860
All mammals have fur or hair and they produce
milk to feed their babies.

314
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:56,160
Giraffes, bears, kangaroos, elephants, and
people are all mammals.

315
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,380
Breeding

316
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,030
It's usually the female mammals who choose
a mate, so the males want the females to look

317
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,870
at them.

318
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:14,720
Leopards make marks on trees with their claws
so that the females will know they are there.

319
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,080
Other animals make special smells.

320
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,140
Males often fight with each other to win a
mate.

321
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:32,710
Male giraffes fight with their head and neck
to show which animal is the strongest.

322
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,990
Having Babies

323
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,540
Most mammals do not lay eggs.

324
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:46,110
The babies grow inside the mother's body,
and they get food and oxygen from a special

325
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,730
part of the body called the placenta.

326
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,110
This is called gestation.

327
00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:07,610
The gestation time for shrews is only two
weeks, but for African elephants it's 22 months!

328
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:13,820
When mammals are ready to have their babies,
many look for safe, quiet places.

329
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:24,170
Polar bears dig special dens in the snow so
that their babies will be warm and safe.

330
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,880
Baby Mammals

331
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,240
Some baby mammals grow a lot inside their
mother's body, and they can stand up as soon

332
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,670
as they are born.

333
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:41,270
Other baby mammals can't see or move when
they are born.

334
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:47,360
Mammals produce milk for their babies, and
this is the only food or drink that they need

335
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,660
at first.

336
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,220
Marsupials

337
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,040
Marsupials are animals like kangaroos and
koalas.

338
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,190
Baby marsupials only grow for a short time
inside their mother's body.

339
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,370
After they are born, they continue to grow
on the outside of their mother's body, usually

340
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,630
in a pouch.

341
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:21,290
Baby kangaroos are only 5 centimeters long
when they are born.

342
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:28,910
They climb into their mother's pouch, where
they stay for up to a year.

343
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,410
Growing Up

344
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:37,780
Mammals are different from many other types
of animal because they feed and care for their

345
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,190
babies.

346
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:46,400
Anteaters carry their babies on their back
for the first year, and elephants stay near

347
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,010
their mother until they are ten years old.

348
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:58,090
Baby mammals learn from their parents, and
they learn by playing, too.

349
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,160
Life Cycles

350
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,360
Life is very dangerous for a lot of animals.

351
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,090
Many are killed by predators.

352
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:16,390
Also, people hunt them and damage their habitats
- the places where they live.

353
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,840
Many animals die before they become adults,
but if they grow up, then they can produce

354
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,940
young.

355
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,200
This is all part of their life cycle.

356
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,610
Because of this, there will always be millions
of species of animal on Earth, if we care

357
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:42,480
for them and their habitats.

358
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,660
- THE END -
