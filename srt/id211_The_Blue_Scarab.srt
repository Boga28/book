CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,500
Cairo

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,440
Monica noticed the gift shop, because of the 
beautiful colours round its door and window.  

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,480
She walked through its entrance which had a sign 
above it. On the sign, the word Cairo was written  

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,420
in bright yellow, orange and green colours, 
with small black figures dancing beside it.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,420
Inside, it was just as colourful.  

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,900
Large animals made of paper, painted in 
very bright colours, hung from the ceiling.  

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,000
The floor had a yellow-brown sand colour 
to it, and the shelves held vases,  

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,220
plates, boxes, musical instruments and 
jewellery Monica had never seen before.

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,240
No one seemed to be in the shop;  

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,460
not a salesperson or a customer. Light Arab 
music came from a stereo Monica could not see,  

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,680
but she moved with its sound as she looked 
at all the wonderful objects in the shop.  

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,160
She saw a blue stone on a gold 
necklace which looked interesting.  

14
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,620
Drawn in the centre of the stone 
there was something which looked  

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,560
like a large round beetle, with thin legs 
and thick antennae coming from its head.

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,740
"It's an Egyptian scarab."

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,020
The woman's voice surprised, then frightened 
Monica. She almost dropped the necklace.

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,520
"I'm sorry I didn't know anyone was here."

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,200
"It's okay, my dear. I knew 
you would be here. Come. Come."

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,980
The woman took Monica's arm and 
led her behind the sales counter  

21
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,760
to a small area where there was 
a round table and two chairs.  

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,080
It was dark because cloth the colour of sand, with 
dark patterns, hung from the walls and ceilings.  

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,980
It was almost closed off from the rest of 
the shop by a curtain, so most of the light  

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,120
came from a few candles set around the room. It 
was like a small cave from somewhere far away.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,900
"Sit. I've made us some tea, 
black tea; the tea of judgement."

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,160
"Judgement?"

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,500
"Yes. The tea leaves tell us 
about a person's entire life.  

28
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,780
Some of us have done things we wish we 
hadn't. Some of us haven't done things  

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,360
we wish we had. Some of us are messengers. 
Some of us are waiting for the message."

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
The woman wore a piece of red 
cloth tied around her head.  

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,880
It hid the colour of her hair. Her eyes were large 
and dark. They became larger when she talked.  

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,540
As Monica sat at the table, she realised 
she still had the necklace in her hand.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,480
"This stone is quite beautiful. 
I've never seen anything like it."

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,420
"It is lapis lazuli, the ancient blue 
stone used to make statues for the gods.  

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,040
It was found in rock, and the rock 
had to be burned and broken to get  

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,180
the lapis lazuli out. That 
shows you how strong it is."

37
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,600
"Well, I'm sure it's too expensive for me..."

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,740
As Monica was about to put 
the necklace on the table,  

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,720
the woman closed her hand around 
Monica's, to keep the stone there.

40
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,880
"Don't let it go, now that 
you have it. It may help  

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,400
you see things you never thought were possible."

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,600
"But... I..."

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,060
The woman put her finger on Monica's 
lips so that she couldn't talk.

44
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,600
"Sit and listen and I will tell 
you the story of the blue scarab."

45
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,860
Monica held the necklace in her hand while 
the woman spoke. Whether it was the heat of  

46
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,960
the room, the tea, or the woman's soft 
voice, Monica began to fall asleep.

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,000
"The scarab is the sacred beetle of the sun 
god, the most important of all the gods as it  

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,840
makes people see things in a different way. It is 
given to a different person every hundred years.  

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,520
The person is chosen by the sun god to act as a 
messenger for the dead. They see and understand  

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,520
things on earth that help the gods decide 
whether the dead have lived good or bad lives.  

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,420
Those who wear it are sometimes frightened because 
they are able to see the dead living again.  

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,800
But they must keep the scarab, as the 
judgement of so many depends on them."

53
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,460
Monica heard the woman's words as she slept.  

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,980
She saw herself living thousands 
of years ago, wearing the scarab.  

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,480
People were touching her hand as she passed 
them. She was smiling and she felt very peaceful.  

56
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,880
When she opened her eyes, she 
looked at the woman talking to her.

57
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,340
"It looks good on you."

58
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,420
Monica touched the necklace with her 
fingers. It was now round her neck.
 
 
 

59
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:51,420
CHAPTER TWO

60
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,040
Herbie

61
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,400
Monica's car had a broken headlight. As she 
drove to a garage to have it fixed, the sun  

62
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,500
came down through the trees along the road, 
making everything seem more alive than usual.

63
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,760
There was an old man cleaning the ground in 
front of the garage when Monica parked her car.  

64
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,020
He had his back to her, so she called to him:

65
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,040
"Excuse me. Do you work here?"

66
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,040
The man did not turn round.

67
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,320
"Excuse me."

68
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:46,080
Monica put her hand on the man's shoulder. He 
turned quickly and Monica saw her father's face.  

69
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
Frightened, she put her hands over her mouth.  

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,540
Her father had died five years 
earlier when she was eighteen.

71
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:00,780
"Dad! Is that you?" 

72
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,380
Tears came to her eyes and her hands shook.  

73
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,740
The man moved his fingers to his mouth and 
ears to show her he could not speak or hear.

74
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,840
"Hello there!"

75
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,020
It was the voice of a young man Monica knew 
from the university. She had forgotten his name.

76
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,400
"It's Owen, remember? We 
met at a party last winter."

77
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,360
"Oh, er yes! I'm Monica."

78
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,560
"I suppose you' ve met Herbie. He just 
started working here this morning."

79
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,840
Monica wouldn't look at the man, 
afraid of what she would see.  

80
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,920
He was talking to Owen in sign language. Owen 
spoke as he made the signs with his fingers.

81
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,440
"Of course you can. I told you, Mr Burns 
lets us take our lunch whenever we want.  

82
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,320
As long as you've finished your 
work. Okay, you're welcome."

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,940
Herbie walked away. Suddenly, 
Owen noticed Monica's necklace.

84
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,700
"Is that a blue scarab you're wearing?"

85
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,340
"Yes, a woman at a shop gave it to me. 
She wouldn't take any money for it."

86
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,780
"It was found in a chest believed to be the 
chest of Osiris, an ancient Egyptian god.  

87
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,860
I read about it in my class on 
ancient Egypt. I study archaeology."

88
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,280
"I think I saw you leaving 
that class once. I had an  

89
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,200
economics class right after it in the same room."

90
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,920
"It's a small world. So, 
what's wrong with your car?"

91
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,880
"It needs a new headlight."

92
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,240
"Oh, that's no problem. I can fix 
that in ten minutes. Why don't you  

93
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,300
go sit in the office? While you wait, 
Mr Burns will write out your bill."

94
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,060
In the office next to the garage, Mr 
Burns sat behind his desk smoking a cigar.  

95
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,140
He was a short, bald man, but Monica didn't know 
how short until he stood up to shake her hand.

96
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,020
"Nathan Burns. Pleased to meet you."

97
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,420
"Monica Halloway. Owen's fixing my headlight. 
Er, he said you'd write up the papers."

98
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,560
"Certainly I will. You just have a seat 
there. I'll take care of it in two minutes."

99
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,060
Monica looked out of the office window 
at Owen working on her car. His thin,  

100
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,820
young face began to look old and tired.

101
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,200
It was as if she was looking 
at a completely different man  

102
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,900
and it frightened her. Mr Burn's 
voice stopped her thinking.

103
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,860
"How do you spell, Halloway, with two Ls or one?"

104
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,100
"What? Oh, two. H, A, double L, O, W, A, Y."

105
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,960
Monica went outside to see Owen as he finished 
his work on her car. He looked like he usually  

106
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,960
did, and Monica forgot about what she thought 
she had seen before. She shook his hand.

107
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,180
"Thank you very much for your help."

108
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,400
"Anytime. It was nice to see you again."

109
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,980
When Owen walked away, Monica saw Herbie 
sitting on a chair by the garage door.  

110
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,840
He was eating a sandwich. She 
saw something on his right arm.  

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,580
It was a purple birthmark, 
the same kind her father had.

112
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,040
"It is you. I knew it!"

113
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,580
She took a few steps towards 
Herbie, but she frightened him.  

114
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,680
He got up and went into the garage. When she 
followed him inside, she saw that he had gone.
 
 
 

115
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,480
CHAPTER THREE

116
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,400
Tops

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,360
"Look. If you don't stop this, you'll get yourself  

118
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,860
into trouble. It was a mistake. You 
saw something which wasn't there,"

119
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,160
Yvonne was able to make Monica relax.  

120
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
They ordered their pizza and began 
to talk about other things when

121
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,760
Monica saw Owen across the room.

122
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,320
"Now don't tell me I don't see him. 
That's the guy who fixed my car."

123
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Owen saw them looking over at him, and he 
waved hello. He walked over and sat with them.

124
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,540
"I'm glad I found you."

125
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,580
"Owen, this is Yvonne."

126
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,300
"Pleased to meet you. Look, I've 
read more about your blue scarab."

127
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,200
"Wait a minute... wait a minute! I've 
just finished telling her that there  

128
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,620
is no such thing as ghosts or sun gods 
or whatever else you want to tell her."

129
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,480
"Yvonne, let him finish."

130
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,540
"The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris, the 
sun god's helper, used that stone so that people  

131
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,220
on earth could help those who had died. They 
thought dead people had to go through a trial.  

132
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,960
In that trial, they had to show that the good 
things they had done on earth were greater  

133
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,340
than the bad things. Their actions could help 
the living improve themselves by teaching them  

134
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,060
something. If the living learn something 
valuable from the life of someone else,  

135
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,840
who is now dead, they can continue 
living their lives in a better way.  

136
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,300
This is good for the living but also for 
the dead. The gods will see that the dead  

137
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,440
had lived good lives since they continue 
influencing the living in a positive way."

138
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,440
"Owen, that was thousands of years ago!"

139
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,160
"Wait a minute, Yvonne. Let's 
just try to understand this.  

140
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,180
Do you think I could have seen 
a dead person alive again?"

141
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,880
"I don't know about that, 
but I know someone who does,  

142
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,760
and he'd like to meet you. 
His name is Professor Lloyd.  

143
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,380
He taught that class on ancient Egypt I told 
you about. Would you like to talk to him?"

144
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,460
"Why not?"

145
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,900
"This is mad!"

146
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,840
Monica was silent for a few minutes, 
because she was thinking of her father.  

147
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,380
She finally asked Owen about Herbie.

148
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,380
"Who's that old man who is working at 
the garage? What's his name, Herbie?"

149
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,420
"Yeah, Herbie. Strange, but right after you left, 
we couldn't find him. He never came back."
 
 
 

150
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,540
CHAPTER FOUR

151
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,200
Professor Lloyd

152
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
When  

153
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,780
Owen and Monica knocked on Professor Lloyd's 
door, they heard a cat miaowing inside.  

154
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,040
They heard Professor Lloyd's 
footsteps coming toward the door,  

155
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,800
then they saw him: a tall 
well-built man with glasses.  

156
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:55,200
He had straight, grey-white hair and a soft, 
kind face. He welcomed them with a large smile.

157
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,520
"You must be Monica."

158
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,420
"Hello Professor Lloyd. It's 
a pleasure to meet you."

159
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,620
"The pleasure is mine.  

160
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,960
From what Owen tells me, you have something 
which may be more powerful than we know."

161
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:15,120
Professor Lloyd's flat was filled with books and 
cats. Each wall was covered with shelves of books,  

162
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,560
and there were cats of every different colour 
sitting on tables, walking across the floor,  

163
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,980
or rubbing themselves against Monica's legs. 
Monica picked up a black one with white paws.

164
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,520
"I love your cats, Professor."

165
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,260
"The Kauri Indians of southern Peru 
believe the cat spirit controls our lives.  

166
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,140
They probably know my cats and my life."

167
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,340
Professor Lloyd laughed loudly. He picked 
up two of the cats as they walked to the  

168
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,200
middle of the room where a bright light hung 
over a square white table with four chairs.

169
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,740
They sat at the table, and the professor 
asked to see the blue scarab. He put a round,  

170
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,620
one-inch eyepiece with black glass over his 
left eye, and he studied the back of the stone.

171
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,300
"Ah, yes. Here are the markings."

172
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,520
The professor was quiet. He took the eyepiece 
away from his eye and looked at Monica.  

173
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,460
Owen was worried.

174
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,980
"What is it Professor?"

175
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,060
"It seems that Monica has been 
chosen as a messenger for the gods."

176
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,380
"Gods! Professor, you don't really 
believe in the gods, do you?"

177
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,520
"What I mean is that this stone is 
exactly like the one in ancient mythology.  

178
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,540
The myth says that certain 
people are chosen to wear it."

179
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,568
"That's what the woman said who gave it to me."

180
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:42,600
"Professor, what are the markings?"

181
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,900
The Professor held the stone up to the light.

182
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,980
"You can't see it clearly without the eyepiece, 
but this marking here is the teeth of a dog.  

183
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,360
The dog watches over the dead. And here is the 
wing of a hawk. The hawk cries for the revenge  

184
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,360
of the dead. But here is the sign connecting 
all the others - the round horn of the ram.  

185
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,380
This represents the power of water. It can 
give life to the dead. The scarab on the front,  

186
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,900
which represents the sun, acts together with water 
to bring peace to both the living and the dead."

187
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
"How do you know all this?"

188
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,920
"It is written in ancient Egyptian tombs, but 
there is another way to see if we are right."

189
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,060
"What's that?"

190
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,200
"We can test the stone to see 
what kind of power it has."
 
 
 

191
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
CHAPTER  

192
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,720
FIVE

193
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,660
Professor Lloyd's Back Room

194
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:13,260
Professor Lloyd took Owen and Monica to the back 
room of his flat, where all the walls were covered  

195
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:20,100
with black curtains. In the centre of the room, 
there was a round, wooden table with strange black  

196
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,040
markings on it. In the centre, there was a circle 
with the drawing of an eye in the middle of it.  

197
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,800
Four spears, like rays of sunlight, went from 
the central circle to the edge of the table,  

198
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,280
dividing the table into four equal parts.  

199
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,180
There was another thin circle of numbers and 
letters that went round the edge of the table.  

200
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,000
Between the central circle and the circle at the 
edge of the table there were four equal spaces. In  

201
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,520
each there was a picture: one of a fish, one of a 
snake, one of the moon, and one of a lotus flower.

202
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Professor Lloyd lit candles in the room as Owen 
and Monica sat at the table. The professor put  

203
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,240
on a tall black hat with a flat top, and a 
long black robe. He was the first to speak.

204
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,260
"We are going to try to call 
people back from the dead.  

205
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,900
If the stone has the power the myth says 
it does, we may hear voices we know."

206
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,980
The professor put the scarab over the eye in the 
centre of the table, with the beetle facing up.

207
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,420
"Now, we must all hold hands and close our eyes.  

208
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,760
Do not break the circle by letting go of the 
hand of the person who is sitting next to you,  

209
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,600
or the ceremony will end. Relax, 
breathe slowly, and do not speak."

210
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,800
They were all very quiet. They 
heard a soft whistling sound.

211
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,960
It became louder, like the sound of the wind. 
The room became cold and all the candles were  

212
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:12,300
blown out. Then there were voices. Wild laughing, 
screams of pain. Then again the sound of the wind.

213
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,920
One voice spoke clearly,

214
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,660
"Jack, it's giving way! The tunnel is giving way!"

215
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,880
"Uncle Bob is that you?"

216
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,940
"Do not speak. They cannot hear you."

217
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,480
"Jack, the tunnel is falling! Jack!"

218
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,670
The sound of an earthquake was heard 
and then nothing. A new voice spoke.

219
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,380
"She means alright, but it's her first 
holiday on her own. Let her enjoy herself."

220
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,920
"Mother. It's me. I'm here!"

221
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,060
"Don't speak!"

222
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,540
More wind, then rain and thunder.

223
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,156
"The boat's going over! I can't hold it!"

224
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:04,800
The woman's voice screamed, then Monica screamed,

225
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,600
"Mother, no! I'm here!"

226
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,100
The lights went on and Monica was 
standing next to the round table  

227
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,260
where the professor and Owen were 
sitting. She ran out of the room.  

228
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,640
The professor found her in the front room 
where she was sitting on the sofa, crying. He  

229
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,520
sat next to her and put his arm round her as Owen 
walked nervously back and forth in front of them.

230
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,600
"It was my mother and father 
on the boat trip where they..."

231
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,360
"There, there. It's over now."

232
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,200
"What was that part about my 
uncle calling my father's name?"

233
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,120
"If you recognise a voice that you hear, it 
means that there is something wrong between  

234
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,280
you and that person. One thing is 
certain, the scarab is real."
 
 
 

235
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,280
CHAPTER SIX

236
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,040
Monica's Father Speaks

237
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,780
Yvonne drove Monica back to the Cairo gift shop 
so she could return the blue scarab to the gypsy  

238
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,080
woman. She did not want the necklace after 
that night at Professor Lloyd's. Her parents  

239
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,540
had both died on a boating holiday and hearing 
their voices again had really frightened her.

240
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,480
They parked the car near what they 
thought was the shop's window.  

241
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,020
The window was old and dirty.  

242
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,120
There was no sign with Cairo written on it. 
The door had wooden boards in front of it.

243
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,760
"I think it was here."

244
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,620
Yvonne looked around the street 
to see if they had made a mistake.  

245
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,080
Monica wiped the dust off one of the store 
windows with a tissue so she could see inside.  

246
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,440
The inside had pieces of wood hanging from the 
ceiling. There were old boards, stones and dirt  

247
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,600
all over the floor. It looked as if it hadn't 
been used for a long time. Then, Monica saw it.  

248
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,780
Hanging from the ceiling, there was one 
of the brightly coloured paper animals.  

249
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,020
It was a bright blue scarab. 
Monica ran to the car.

250
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,060
"Let's get out of here."

251
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,500
"What's wrong? What's happened?"

252
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,240
Yvonne got in the car, but Monica 
couldn't tell her what happened.

253
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,560
"Just drive me to the university. 
I'm not keeping this scarab."

254
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,300
"What are you going to do with it?"

255
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,100
"Give it to Professor Lloyd."

256
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,820
Yvonne left Monica at the university, 
where Professor Lloyd had an office on  

257
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,480
the top floor of the library. 
Monica knocked on the door.

258
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
"Yes?"

259
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,160
Monica opened the door.

260
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,500
"Professor Lloyd?"

261
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,200
"Monica, my dear! Come in. Come in."

262
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,400
Monica remembered the woman in 
the shop saying something similar.  

263
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:41,100
She took the necklace out of her bag and put it on 
the professor's desk. The sun was shining through  

264
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:49,920
the window. It hit the scarab. When Professor 
Lloyd spoke, he had Monica's father's voice.

265
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,560
"Monica, don't be afraid."

266
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,062
Monica covered her mouth with her hands.

267
00:25:55,062 --> 00:26:00,180
"It's okay, dear. I need to talk to you. I 
know I was angry at you for not going with  

268
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,840
us on that boating trip, but you mustn't feel 
bad about it. You lived. Now we need your help.  

269
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,540
Keep the necklace. Live the best life 
possible. That will help us now."

270
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,580
The professor stopped talking, 
then he walked to the window.  

271
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:26,760
Monica sat looking at the scarab. She wasn't 
frightened. In fact, she felt very happy and calm.

272
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,460
"What does it mean, Professor?"

273
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,380
He did not turn to look at her. He 
spoke with his own voice this time.

274
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,060
"If you live a good life, you forgive 
others and try to help those you can.  

275
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,760
This has a great effect, because it shows that you 
have learned something from other people's lives.  

276
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,520
By doing this you will be able to teach 
others who will live after you have died."

277
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,280
She put the scarab around her 
neck. The professor continued.

278
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,320
"The fact that you were chosen to wear the 
scarab means you can do more than others.  

279
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,480
You can help many."

280
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,440
"Really, Professor? But how can this be done?"

281
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,700
"We all have people we have loved and who are now 
dead. We want their lives to be judged fairly."

282
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:23,160
The professor never turned away from the window. 
Before Monica left, he said two more words to her.

283
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,140
"Thank you."
 
 
 

284
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,200
CHAPTER SEVEN

285
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,080
Osiris and Seth

286
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:02,520
Owen was reading a book about Egyptian gods. It 
said that Osiris, the one who judges those who  

287
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:10,860
die, was once a king. His brother Seth wanted 
to be king, so he played a trick on Osiris.  

288
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,300
He brought him a beautiful, large chest,  

289
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:22,200
and he told the king that he could have the chest 
if he could fit inside it. After the king lay down  

290
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,040
in the chest, Seth quickly closed it, threw it 
into the Nile river, and it sailed out to sea.

291
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,680
Owen put the book down, because he began thinking 
of his own father's death. His father had been  

292
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:44,340
killed at an archaeological site. He was a famous 
archaeologist, which is why Owen wanted to be one.  

293
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,100
Owen's uncle was with Owen's father when he 
died. He came to live with Owen and his mother  

294
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,140
afterwards, and Owen had always thought his 
uncle didn't care about his father's death.  

295
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,060
He never talked about him and he behaved as 
if he were Owen's father. The voice he heard  

296
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:12,120
at the professor's suddenly meant something 
to him. He felt he had to talk to Monica.  

297
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,120
He remembered where she lived, because he 
had driven her home from the professor's.  

298
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,880
He hoped she wasn't asleep.

299
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,700
Monica was asleep when she heard the loud 
knocking at her door. It frightened her.

300
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,720
"Who is it?"

301
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,920
"It's me, Owen. Could you open 
the door? I have to talk to you!"

302
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,360
Owen looked awful. He held 
his books tightly in his arms  

303
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,300
and his hair stood up on his head 
as if he had been pulling at it.

304
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,680
"Can I come in? I've got something 
really important to talk to you about."

305
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:56,400
"Yes, come in, but calm down."

306
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,300
Monica made them some hot chocolate 
while Owen told her what he had read.

307
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,100
"I still don't understand what that 
story has to do with your uncle."

308
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,540
"That was my uncle's voice we heard at 
Professor Lloyd's. I know it's wrong,  

309
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,740
but I always thought my uncle had something to do 
with my father's death. He never talked about it."

310
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,320
"But that has nothing to do with the scarab."

311
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,700
"It does. Don't you remember Professor Lloyd 
telling us about the markings on the back?"

312
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,660
"Yes."

313
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,680
"Well, one of those marks was the 
ram's horn. It's the sign of water,  

314
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,620
which connects all the other signs. Osiris 
was killed by water. He looks after the dead,  

315
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,660
that's why there arc the 
markings of the dog's teeth."

316
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,340
"And the hawk's wing?"

317
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,500
"Osiris' son, Horus, killed his uncle 
for his lather. When Horus died,  

318
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,580
he became the hawk god who sits by his father 
when he judges the dead and cries for them."

319
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,760
Monica touched the scarab around her 
neck. She knew that she and Owen had  

320
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,680
been brought together for some reason. 
Maybe she could do something for him.  

321
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,660
Owen was holding his cup of hot chocolate, 
thinking very hard. Finally, he spoke.

322
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,300
"I think I should go and talk to my uncle."

323
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,640
"He would probably like that."

324
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,140
"I haven't spoken to him in five years."

325
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,420
"Would you like me to go with you?"

326
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,580
He looked at Monica.  

327
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,520
"Yes."
 
 
 

328
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,680
CHAPTER EIGHT

329
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,480
The Gloves

330
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,280
Owen's uncle was painting the front of his house 
when Monica and Owen drove up the dirt road.  

331
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,940
He pushed back his cap to get a better look, and 
seemed very surprised when he saw who it was.  

332
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,400
Owen held out his hand.

333
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,780
"Hello, uncle Bob."

334
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,480
They shook hands, then hugged.

335
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,220
"You're the last person in the world I 
expected to see coming up that road today."

336
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,100
"Well, I thought, it was time 
I paid a visit to say hello."

337
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,620
Uncle Bob's blue eyes were bright with 
happiness as he looked into his nephew's eyes.  

338
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,020
He looked over at Monica.

339
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,080
"I'm sorry. This is my friend, Monica."

340
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
"How do you do?"

341
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,020
"Nice to meet you, sir."

342
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,840
They all went and sat on the back porch which 
looked onto a huge empty field surrounded by  

343
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:38,940
trees. Uncle Bob brought them some lemonade. A 
large friendly dog lay next to Monica's chair  

344
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,220
and she lightly scratched its head.

345
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,120
"Do you two mind if I take a 
walk with my new friend here?"

346
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
The men didn't answer,  

347
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,280
so Monica ran down the porch steps into 
the field with the dog following her.

348
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,600
"Uncle Bob, what happened the day my father died?"

349
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,300
His uncle stopped talking and looked at 
the long empty field in front of him.  

350
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,780
Monica had disappeared somewhere with the dog.

351
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,940
"We never really talked about 
that, did we? But maybe it's time."

352
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,840
"I never understood why you never 
mentioned his name alter he died."

353
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,900
His uncle looked over at him.

354
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,920
"Owen, some things hurt too much to talk about."

355
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,560
"Do you think you could talk about it now?"

356
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:32,340
"I could try. You see, there was this 
big earthquake two days before we went  

357
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,200
down in the tunnel. I told your father 
there would be another one, but he..."

358
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
His uncle was having trouble telling this part.

359
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,120
"...but he wouldn't listen. It was 
our last day, and he wanted to go.  

360
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,160
When it hit, I was up above cleaning 
some of the pieces we'd found."

361
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,420
Owen could see it happening. He didn't even 
notice that his uncle had got up to go inside.  

362
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,300
He heard the back door open, and then 
he saw his uncle standing next to him,  

363
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,400
holding an old pair of gloves.

364
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,260
"Your father gave these to me the day he 
died because I had left mine at home. He  

365
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,240
wore them every time he went out to dig. I 
think he'd have wanted you to have them."

366
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:29,160
Owen held the gloves in his hands. He put 
them on. There were tears in his eyes.  

367
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,020
His uncle put his arm around him.

368
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,020
Soon after Monica returned from her 
walk, she and Owen got ready to leave.  

369
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,280
They promised uncle Bob they 
would come back again soon.  

370
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,660
As they drove away, Monica beeped the horn twice.

371
00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:06,840
In the car, Owen was quiet. Monica saw the gloves 
in his hand, but she didn't ask him about them.  

372
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,540
That was between Owen, his 
uncle and his father.
 
 
 

373
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:39,300
CHAPTER NINE

374
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:39,900
Cemetery

375
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,100
After leaving Owen's uncle, Monica 
did something Owen didn't expect.  

376
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,160
She drove the car into a cemetery.

377
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,740
"Where are we going?"

378
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:03,840
"My parents were buried here. I 
want to see their gravestones."

379
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,380
They parked the car in the 
visitors' car park, then walked.  

380
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,460
The sun was very bright. They were walking 
through a field of white crosses and gravestones.  

381
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,760
They stopped to look at some of the older ones.

382
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,120
"Look at this one, 1826."

383
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:28,440
"And this one is from 1905. Michael 
Mason. Look, his wife died a year later."

384
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,600
"I think I like archaeology because of the 
connection between two periods of time.  

385
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,920
I mean, when I understand the way 
someone lived hundreds of years ago,  

386
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,140
I understand more about the way we live now."

387
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,020
Monica took Owen's hand and walked 
with him to her parents' graves.

388
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,500
"They were never buried here. We just 
have the graves to remember them. They  

389
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,100
died at sea. Their bodies were never found."

390
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,060
Monica took a jar of water from her coat pocket.  

391
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,200
She poured some of it over each 
of her parents' gravestones.

392
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,060
"What's that?"

393
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,560
"It's water I took from the sea. I was at 
my parents' funeral, but I never felt like  

394
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,440
I said goodbye. This is something I thought of 
doing to let them know that everything is okay."

395
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,980
"Was there a problem between you and 
your parents?" "Well, my father loved  

396
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,780
our family holidays. The summer they died 
was the first time I hadn't gone with them.  

397
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,480
Some friends of mine had a beach house. I 
was eighteen. I wanted to be with my friends.  

398
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,660
My dad and I had a big fight. We didn't talk to 
each other before he left on their boat trip.  

399
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,160
I felt guilty about that. In fact, I never forgave 
myself, until I began to believe in this scarab."

400
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,940
She touched the stone on her neck. "You 
think your father will somehow feel that  

401
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,460
your argument meant nothing compared 
to how much you loved each other?"

402
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,900
"Something like that. All the things I've seen and 
heard since I got the scarab have given me hope.  

403
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,660
I would like to believe that I live a better 
life now because of the good things done by  

404
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,140
the people who lived before me. It does 
justify their life. If what the ancient  

405
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,760
Egyptians said was true, I mean the fact that 
people's lives are judged after they die,  

406
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:30,180
then I believe it's our duty to show the gods that 
those who died did help us by their good actions.  

407
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
It's a good reason to do the best you can."

408
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,020
As Owen and Monica walked back to the 
car in the bright golden sunlight,  

409
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,480
they looked like two dark figures 
slowly disappearing into the distance.

410
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,340
CHAPTER TEN

411
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,820
The Blue Scarab

412
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,220
Monica was sitting in the living 
room of Owen's Hat, waiting for him.  

413
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,540
He had gone to use a neighbour's 
telephone because his was out of order.  

414
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,440
She found a book on the table next to her. 
It was a library book on ancient Egypt.  

415
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,120
She opened it to the story 
of Osiris and began to read:

416
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
After  

417
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,540
Seth had thrown the chest, with Osiris inside, 
into the Nile, Osiris' wife, his, went to look  

418
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,560
for it. She found the chest, but before she 
could open it and bury the body, Seth stole  

419
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,880
it from her. He cut the body into sixteen 
separate pieces and hid them all over Egypt.  

420
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:11,940
Again, Isis went to look for them. This time, she 
took her sister, Nephthys, with her. Together they  

421
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:19,620
found each piece. Isis had magical powers. She 
put the body back together with a special oil.

422
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,940
"This oil is from the tree of healing. 
It will keep the body after it is buried.  

423
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,800
This white cloth that I will put around him will 
let the gods know that he was a great king."

424
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,620
The gods liked what Isis had 
done, and they rewarded Osiris.

425
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,520
"Osiris will decide on the life of the dead. If 
someone is good and just, they will be rewarded.  

426
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,580
Those who are evil and do not respect 
others' lives will be punished."

427
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:03,000
So, Osiris was made the judge of the dead. When 
somebody died, their soul, which left their body,  

428
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,740
was put through forty-two tests. After these 
tests, the soul was brought before Osiris.

429
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,520
Osiris sat in front of a pair of scales.  

430
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,120
He held a feather in his hand. Next to 
him there was a man with a dog's head  

431
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,720
and a man with the head of a falcon. Osiris 
held the feather out to the dog's head.

432
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,600
"Anubis, take this feather and 
place it on one end of the scale.  

433
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,080
It is the feather of truth. It will tell us 
who has lived a just life and who has not."

434
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,740
Osiris then spoke to the falcon head.

435
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:50,100
"Horus, you are my son. You tried to find 
revenge for my death by killing your uncle.  

436
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,020
Take the soul and put it on the opposite end of 
the scale. There you will cry for its revenge."

437
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,520
The falcon head walked to the 
scale opposite the dog's head.  

438
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,920
They held each scale until 
Osiris told them to let them go.

439
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,140
"This soul has passed through the forty-two tests.  

440
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,640
These tests were given to decide if your good 
deeds in life are greater than your bad ones.  

441
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,540
You have not passed these tests alone. 
People who are living have acted for you.  

442
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:32,820
Now, it is time to see. Have you lived a 
good and just life? Let go of the scales."

443
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:42,660
The falcon and dog let go of the scales. The 
falcon made a loud cry. The scales balanced.  

444
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,320
Osiris held up the blue scarab.

445
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,420
"This is what we will use to speak to the living. 
Through this the souls of the dead will be judged.  

446
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,260
We hope that the living will 
understand what we say."

447
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,260
"Now, I understand."

448
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,740
Monica closed the book and 
put it back on the table.  

449
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,360
She walked to the window and looked outside. 
Everything was bathed in the sunlight. She touched  

450
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:29,220
the scarab round her neck and closed her eyes. 
She said to herself softly, "Now, I understand."
