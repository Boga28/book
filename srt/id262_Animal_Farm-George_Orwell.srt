Animal Farm

00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,240
CHAPTER I

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:16,080
Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for
the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:33,120
With the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door,
drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,640
As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring
and a fluttering all through the farm buildings.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:51,040
Word had gone round during the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had
a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,640
It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn
as soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way.

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Old Major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon Beauty) was so
highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:23,120
At one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already
ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam.

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:35,400
He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig,
with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut.

12
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,680
Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves
comfortable after their different fashions.

13
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,440
First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, and then the
pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:02:00,680
The hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the
rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud.

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:12,320
The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their
vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw.

16
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:21,440
Clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who
had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal.

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,760
Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and
as strong as any two ordinary horses put together.

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:43,800
A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate
intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,800
After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the
donkey.

20
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered.


21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:07,240
He seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark for instance, he would say
that God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies.

22
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,720
Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed.

23
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,360
If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at.

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:29,080
Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent their
Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:40,000
The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the
barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and
the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep.

27
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:58,640
At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew Mr.
Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar.

28
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,360
She took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane,
hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with.

29
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer
and Clover; there she purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying.

30
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,440
All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven,
who slept on a perch behind the back door.

31
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,640
When Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable
and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began:

32
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:44,360
"Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that
I had last night.

33
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,120
But I will come to the dream later.

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
I have something else to say first.

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:00,640
I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and
before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired.

36
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:15,200
I have had a long life, I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think
I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living.

37
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,560
It is about this that I wish to speak to you."

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,480
Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours?

39
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,120
Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short.


40
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:47,960
We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work
to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty.

41
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,960
No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure
after he is a year old.

42
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
No animal in England is free.

43
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,960
The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain
truth.

44
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,920
"But is this simply part of the order of nature?

45
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,720
Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford
a decent life to those who dwell upon it?

46
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,640
No, comrades, a thousand times no!

47
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:30,720
The soil of England is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording
food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it.

48
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:42,200
This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep and
all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining.

49
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,520
Why then do we continue in this miserable condition?

50
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,240
Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen
from us by human beings.

51
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,320
There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems.

52
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,440
It is summed up in a single word Man.

53
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
Man is the only real enemy we have.

54
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,280
Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork
is abolished for ever.

55
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,000
"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing.

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,520
He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to
pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits.

57
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,160
Yet he is lord of all the animals.

58
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:37,320
He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that
will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.

59
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:46,600
Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there
is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin.

60
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,080
You cows that I see before me, how many thousands of gallons
of milk have you given during this last year?

61
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,000
And what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding
up sturdy calves?

62
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies.

63
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:09,440
And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year,
and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens?

64
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,280
The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones
and his men.

65
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:23,400
And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should
have been the support and pleasure of your old age?

66
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,560
Each was sold at a year old you will never see one of them again.


67
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,440
In return for your four confinements and all your labour in the
fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?

68
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,840
"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach
their natural span.

69
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,680
For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky ones.

70
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,560
I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children.


71
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,520
Such is the natural life of a pig.

72
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,760
But no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end.

73
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,680
You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one
of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year.

74
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:17,120
To that horror we all must come cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone.


75
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,480
Even the horses and the dogs have no better fate.

76
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:33,280
You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will
sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.

77
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:41,360
As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties
a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.

78
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:52,080
"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils
of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?

79
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,600
Only get rid of Man, and the produce of our labour would be our
own.

80
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,320
Almost overnight we could become rich and free.

81
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,160
What then must we do?

82
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,120
Why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of
the human race!

83
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,680
That is my message to you, comrades: Rebellion!

84
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:30,840
I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I
know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done.

85
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,920
Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder
of your lives!

86
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:48,320
And above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so
that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious.

87
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,280
"And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter.

88
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,320
No argument must lead you astray.

89
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:08,480
Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common
interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others.

90
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,920
It is all lies.

91
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,240
Man serves the interests of no creature except himself.

92
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:23,320
And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship
in the struggle.

93
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,160
All men are enemies.

94
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,000
All animals are comrades."

95
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,840
At this moment there was a tremendous uproar.

96
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:40,160
While Major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their
holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him.

97
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,360
The dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by
a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives.

98
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
Major raised his trotter for silence.

99
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,520
"Comrades," he said, "here is a point that must be settled.

100
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:03,960
The wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits are they our friends
or our enemies?

101
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Let us put it to the vote.

102
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,600
I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats comrades?"

103
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,560
The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming
majority that rats were comrades.

104
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:25,000
There were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat,
who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides.

105
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,480
Major continued:

106
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,680
"I have little more to say.

107
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,480
I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards
Man and all his ways.

108
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,280
Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

109
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,880
Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

110
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,360
And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come
to resemble him.

111
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,760
Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices.

112
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:12,040
No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes,
or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade.

113
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
All the habits of Man are evil.

114
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,360
And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind.


115
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers.

116
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,440
No animal must ever kill any other animal.

117
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
All animals are equal.

118
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:41,480
"And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night.


119
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,600
I cannot describe that dream to you.

120
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,920
It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished.


121
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,280
But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten.

122
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:04,800
Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to
sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words.

123
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,320
I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed
out of my mind.

124
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,040
Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream.

125
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:29,040
And what is more, the words of the song also came back-words, I am certain, which
were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations.

126
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,800
I will sing you that song now, comrades.

127
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,120
I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the
tune, you can sing it better for yourselves.

128
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,680
It is called 'Beasts of England'."

129
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,560
Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing.

130
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:53,880
As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it
was a stirring tune, something between 'Clementine' and 'La Cucaracha'.

131
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
The words ran:

132
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,560
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and
clime, Hearken to my joyful tidings Of the golden future time.

133
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Soon or late the day is coming, Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown,
And the fruitful fields of England Shall be trod by beasts alone.

134
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:19,000
Rings shall vanish from our noses, And the harness from our back,
Bit and spur shall rust forever, Cruel whips no more shall crack.

135
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:29,720
Riches more than mind can picture, Wheat and barley, oats and hay,
Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels Shall be ours upon that day.

136
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:38,120
Bright will shine the fields of England, Purer shall its waters be,
Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes On the day that sets us free.

137
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:46,840
For that day we all must labour, Though we die before it break; Cows
and horses, geese and turkeys, All must toil for freedom's sake.

138
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,160
Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and clime,
Hearken well and spread my tidings Of the golden future time.''

139
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,160
The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement.


140
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,320
Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun singing
it for themselves.

141
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:19,960
Even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the
clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes.

142
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:28,800
And then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst
out into 'Beasts of England' in tremendous unison.

143
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,400
The cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it,
the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it.

144
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:48,080
They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in
succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.

145
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,800
Unfortunately, the uproar awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of
bed, making sure that there was a fox in the yard.

146
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,920
He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom,
and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness.

147
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,280
The pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the
meeting broke up hurriedly.

148
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,240
Everyone fled to his own sleeping-place.

149
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,320
The birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down
in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.

150
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,400
CHAPTER II

151
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,280
Three nights later old Major died peacefully in his sleep.

152
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,600
His body was buried at the foot of the orchard.

153
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,680
This was early in March.

154
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,560
During the next three months there was much secret activity.

155
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:31,280
Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the
farm a completely new outlook on life.

156
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:42,680
They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking
that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it.

157
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,320
The work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the
pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals.

158
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,680
Preeminent among the pigs were two young boars named Snowball
and Napoleon, whom Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale.

159
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:14,800
Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on
the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way.

160
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:25,320
Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more
inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.

161
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,680
All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers.

162
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:39,520
The best known among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very
round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice.

163
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:51,240
He was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way
of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive.

164
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,000
The others said of Squealer that he could turn black into white.


165
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,680
These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete
system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism.

166
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Several nights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings
in the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others.

167
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,400
At the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy.

168
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:19,000
Some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they
referred to as "Master," or made elementary remarks such as "Mr. Jones feeds us.

169
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,440
If he were gone, we should starve to death."

170
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:35,320
Others asked such questions as "Why should we care what happens after we are dead?" or "If this
Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?", and

171
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,080
the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was
contrary to the spirit of Animalism.

172
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,240
The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white
mare.

173
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,760
The very first question she asked Snowball was: "Will there still
be sugar after the Rebellion?"

174
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,920
"No," said Snowball firmly.

175
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,640
"We have no means of making sugar on this farm.

176
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
Besides, you do not need sugar.

177
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
You will have all the oats and hay you want."

178
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,440
"And shall I still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?" asked
Mollie.

179
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,600
"Comrade," said Snowball, "those ribbons that you are so devoted
to are the badge of slavery.

180
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,120
Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?"


181
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,080
Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.

182
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put
about by Moses, the tame raven.

183
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,440
Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer,
but he was also a clever talker.

184
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,840
He claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called
Sugarcandy Mountain, to which all animals went when they died.

185
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,120
It was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond
the clouds, Moses said.

186
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:47,720
In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season
all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges.

187
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:59,760
The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy
Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.

188
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,800
Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer
and Clover.

189
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:17,080
These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their
teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments.

190
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:24,600
They were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and
led the singing of 'Beasts of England', with which the meetings always ended.

191
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,680
Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier
and more easily than anyone had expected.

192
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,680
In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable
farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days.

193
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,880
He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit,
and had taken to drinking more than was good for him.

194
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:52,600
For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the
newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer.

195
00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:01,600
His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings
wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.

196
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting.

197
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,000
On Midsummer's Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and
got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday.

198
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,920
The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had
gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.

199
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,440
When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the
News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed.

200
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,240
At last they could stand it no longer.

201
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,560
One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her
horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins.

202
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,080
It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up.

203
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,840
The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with
whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions.

204
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,480
This was more than the hungry animals could bear.

205
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,240
With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned
beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors.

206
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,520
Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and
kicked from all sides.

207
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,560
The situation was quite out of their control.

208
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:20,160
They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they
were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits.

209
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:31,520
After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves
and took to their heels.

210
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:39,840
A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track
that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.

211
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:50,240
Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung
a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way.

212
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,200
Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly.


213
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:05,520
Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to
the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them.

214
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:14,200
And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been
successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.

215
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,640
For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in
their good fortune.

216
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:32,400
Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being
was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign.

217
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:41,880
The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the
cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well.

218
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,320
The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags,
were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard.

219
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,160
So were the whips.

220
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,720
All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going
up in flames.

221
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the
horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.

222
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,840
"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are
the mark of a human being.

223
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,200
All animals should go naked."

224
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:15,320
When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer
to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest.

225
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,560
In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that
reminded them of Mr. Jones.

226
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:30,720
Napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a
double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog.

227
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:43,640
Then they sang 'Beasts of England' from end to end seven times running, and after
that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.

228
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:53,320
But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious
thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together.

229
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,680
A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded
a view of most of the farm.

230
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,920
The animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the
clear morning light.

231
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,160
Yes, it was theirs everything that they could see was theirs!


232
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:14,960
In the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round,
they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement.

233
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:24,040
They rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass,
they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent.

234
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:34,320
Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless
admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney.

235
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,320
It was as though they had never seen these things before, and
even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.

236
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,600
Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence
outside the door of the farmhouse.

237
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,520
That was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside.

238
00:26:50,520 --> 00:27:07,680
After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the
animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything.

239
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:39,440
They tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their
feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece.

240
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,680
They were lust coming down the stairs when Mollie was discovered
to be missing.

241
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Going back, the others found that she had remained behind in
the best bedroom.

242
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:58,720
She had taken a piece of blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing-table, and was holding
it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner.

243
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,200
The others reproached her sharply, and they went outside.

244
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:18,120
Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the
scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched.

245
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,440
A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse
should be preserved as a museum.

246
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,120
All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.

247
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:35,760
The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon
called them together again.

248
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:50,600
"Comrades," said Snowball, "it is half-past six and we have a
long day before us.

249
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,160
Today we begin the hay harvest.

250
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,200
But there is another matter that must be attended to first."

251
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:14,680
The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an
old spelling book which had belonged to Mr. Jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap.

252
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:25,000
Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the
way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road.

253
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:37,800
Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of
his trotter, painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM.

254
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,200
This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards.

255
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:54,720
After this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and Napoleon sent
for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn.

256
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:04,400
They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had
succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to Seven Commandments.

257
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:13,520
These Seven Commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an
unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.

258
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,920
With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) Snowball
climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot.

259
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:28,280
The Commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white
letters that could be read thirty yards away.

260
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,120
They ran thus:

261
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,920
THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS

262
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,040
1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.

263
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:42,160
2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

264
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,280
3. No animal shall wear clothes.

265
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,560
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.

266
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,040
5.

267
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,040
No animal shall drink alcohol.

268
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,480
6.

269
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,040
No animal shall kill any other animal.

270
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,280
7.

271
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,040
All animals are equal.

272
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It was very neatly written, and except that "friend" was written
"freind" and one of the "S's" was the wrong way round

273
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,400
, the spelling was correct all the way through.

274
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,920
Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others.

275
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:23,440
All the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer
ones at once began to learn the Commandments by heart.

276
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,960
"Now, comrades," cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush,
"to the hayfield!

277
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,280
Let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly
than Jones and his men could do."

278
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:45,720
But at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for
some time past, set up a loud lowing.

279
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,280
They had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and their udders
were almost bursting.

280
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:07,360
After a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows
fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task.

281
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:20,160
Soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which
many of the animals looked with considerable interest.

282
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,360
"What is going to happen to all that milk?" said someone.

283
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,920
"Jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash," said one
of the hens.

284
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,360
"Never mind the milk, comrades!" cried Napoleon, placing himself
in front of the buckets.

285
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,800
"That will be attended to.

286
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,160
The harvest is more important.

287
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,680
Comrade Snowball will lead the way.

288
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
I shall follow in a few minutes.

289
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,560
Forward, comrades!

290
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,920
The hay is waiting."

291
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:58,480
So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when
they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.

292
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,800
CHAPTER III

293
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,040
How they toiled and sweated to get the hay in!

294
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,160
But their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even
bigger success than they had hoped.

295
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:27,240
Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and
it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs.

296
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,080
But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round
every difficulty.

297
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:41,840
As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the
business of mowing and raking far better than Jones and his men had ever done.

298
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,920
The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the
others.

299
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,120
With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should
assume the leadership.

300
00:33:51,120 --> 00:34:15,440
Boxer and Clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of course) and tramp
steadily round and round the field with a pig walking behind and calling out "Gee up, comrade!" or "Whoa back, comrade!" as the case might be.

301
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,240
And every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the hay
and gathering it.

302
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:29,280
Even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun,
carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks.

303
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,960
In the end they finished the harvest in two days' less time than
it had usually taken Jones and his men.

304
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,680
Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen.


305
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:45,480
There was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their
sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk.

306
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,240
And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.


307
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,600
All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork.


308
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,840
The animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible
to be.

309
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:08,240
Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own
food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master.

310
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,440
With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more
for everyone to eat.

311
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,240
There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals
were.

312
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:40,360
They met with many difficulties for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff
with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine but the pigs with their cleverness and Boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through.

313
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,440
Boxer was the admiration of everybody.

314
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:54,920
He had been a hard worker even in Jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than
one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders.

315
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,440
From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the
spot where the work was hardest.

316
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:15,920
He had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone
else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work began.

317
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,320
His answer to every problem, every setback, was "I will work
harder!" which he had adopted as his personal motto.

318
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,880
But everyone worked according to his capacity

319
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:35,760
The hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn
at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains.

320
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:46,840
Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy
which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared.

321
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,440
Nobody shirked or almost nobody.

322
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:57,080
Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a
way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof.

323
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,560
And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.

324
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,560
It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat
could never be found.

325
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:15,400
She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or
in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened.

326
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:22,800
But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately,
that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.

327
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the Rebellion.


328
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,240
He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in
Jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either.

329
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,120
About the Rebellion and its results he would express no opinion.


330
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:44,560
When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones was gone,
he would say only "Donkeys live a long time.

331
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,760
None of you has ever seen a dead donkey," and the others had
to be content with this cryptic answer.

332
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,440
On Sundays there was no work.

333
00:37:52,440 --> 00:38:03,320
Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast
there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail.

334
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,360
First came the hoisting of the flag.

335
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:15,680
Snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of
Mrs. Jones's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white.

336
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,520
This was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every Sunday
morning.

337
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:32,760
The flag was green, Snowball explained, to represent the green fields of England, while the hoof and horn
signified the future Republic of the Animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown.

338
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:44,440
After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the
big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting.

339
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:54,560
Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions
were put forward and debated.

340
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,080
It was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions.

341
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,360
The other animals understood how to vote, but could never think
of any resolutions of their own.

342
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Snowball and Napoleon were by far the most active in the debates.


343
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:15,280
But it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever
suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it.

344
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:30,440
Even when it was resolved a thing no one could object to in itself to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home
of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal.

345
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,520
The Meeting always ended with the singing of 'Beasts of England',
and the afternoon was given up to recreation.

346
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,680
The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for
themselves.

347
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:51,560
Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other
necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse.

348
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:59,960
Snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals
into what he called Animal Committees.

349
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,840
He was indefatigable at this.

350
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:27,000
He formed the Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the object of this
was to tame the rats and rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing.

351
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,560
On the whole, these projects were a failure.

352
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:37,560
The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down
almost immediately.

353
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,520
They continued to behave very much as before, and when treated
with generosity, simply took advantage of it.

354
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,480
The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was very active
in it for some days.

355
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:58,400
She was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows
who were just out of her reach.

356
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:08,440
She was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow
who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.

357
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,800
The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success.


358
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,360
By the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in
some degree.

359
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:23,000
As for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly.


360
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested
in reading anything except the Seven Commandments.

361
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,960
Muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to
the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap.

362
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,320
Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his
faculty.

363
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,800
So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading.

364
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,600
Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together.


365
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,720
Boxer could not get beyond the letter D.

366
00:41:48,720 --> 00:42:09,520
He would trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his
ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding.

367
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:19,080
On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he
knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D.

368
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,680
Finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and
used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory.

369
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,960
Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her
own name.

370
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:41,040
She would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then
decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them.

371
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,760
None of the other animals on the farm could get further than
the letter A.

372
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:56,800
It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens,
and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart.

373
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:07,160
After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in
effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad."

374
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,920
This, he said, contained the essential principle of Animalism.


375
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,840
Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences.


376
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:25,160
The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also
had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was not so.

377
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:34,080
"A bird's wing, comrades," he said, "is an organ of propulsion
and not of manipulation.

378
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,160
It should therefore be regarded as a leg.

379
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,760
The distinguishing mark of man is the HAND, the instrument with
which he does all his mischief."

380
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:52,480
The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted his
explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart.

381
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:13,160
FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the Seven Commandments and in bigger letters When they had once got it by
heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad!

382
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,360
Four

383
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:13,400
legs

384
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:13,760
good

385
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,760
, two legs bad!" and keep it up for hours on end, never growing
tired of it.

386
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,200
Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees.

387
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,240
He said that the education of the young was more important than
anything that could be done for those who were already grown up.

388
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,160
It happened that Jessie and Bluebell had both whelped soon after
the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies.

389
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,280
As soon as they were weaned, Napoleon took them away from their mothers,
saying that he would make himself responsible for their education.

390
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:55,920
He took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room,
and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence.

391
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,880
The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up.

392
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,880
It was mixed every day into the pigs' mash.

393
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,400
The early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard
was littered with windfalls.

394
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:20,040
The animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order
went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs.

395
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,160
At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use.


396
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,960
All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball
and Napoleon.

397
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,920
Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others.


398
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,600
"Comrades!" he cried.

399
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:39,200
"You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a
spirit of selfishness and privilege?

400
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Many of us actually dislike milk and apples.

401
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
I dislike them myself.

402
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,680
Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health.


403
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:56,560
Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades)
contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig.

404
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,720
We pigs are brainworkers.

405
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:04,080
The whole management and organisation of this farm depend on
us.

406
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,520
Day and night we are watching over your welfare.

407
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,560
It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.


408
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,520
Do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty?

409
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,240
Jones would come back!

410
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,440
Yes, Jones would come back!

411
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:32,600
Surely, comrades," cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and
whisking his tail, "surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?"

412
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:39,160
Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain
of, it was that they did not want Jones back.

413
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,440
When it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say.


414
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,160
The importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too
obvious.

415
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:55,520
So it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and
also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.

416
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,160
CHAPTER IV

417
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:05,000
By the late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm
had spread across half the county.

418
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Every day Snowball and Napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals
on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion, and teach them the tune of 'Beasts of England'.

419
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:29,960
Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would
listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals.

420
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:37,400
The other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not
at first give him much help.

421
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,800
At heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could
not somehow turn Jones's misfortune to his own advantage.

422
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:55,880
It was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined
Animal Farm were on permanently bad terms.

423
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:15,440
One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much
overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition.

424
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:25,960
Its owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who
spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season.

425
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,360
The other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and
better kept.

426
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:41,600
Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually
involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains.

427
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:49,760
These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them
to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.

428
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:59,920
Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on Animal Farm,
and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it.

429
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:06,520
At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals
managing a farm for themselves.

430
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,400
The whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said.

431
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:28,920
They put it about that the animals on the Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it the Manor Farm; they would not
tolerate the name "Animal Farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death.

432
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:41,720
When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, Frederick and Pilkington
changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm.

433
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:53,520
It was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured
one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common.

434
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:00,320
This was what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick
and Pilkington said.

435
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,680
However, these stories were never fully believed.

436
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:25,080
Rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued
to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside.

437
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:42,240
Bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the
clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side.

438
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,600
Above all, the tune and even the words of 'Beasts of England'
were known everywhere.

439
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,800
It had spread with astonishing speed.

440
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,440
The human beings could not contain their rage when they heard
this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous.

441
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:03,520
They could not understand, they said, how even animals could
bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish.

442
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,160
Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot.


443
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,560
And yet the song was irrepressible.

444
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:21,480
The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the
elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells.

445
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:30,000
And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled,
hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.

446
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:45,680
Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of
pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement.

447
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:58,480
Jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield, had
entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm.

448
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,360
They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was marching
ahead with a gun in his hands.

449
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:08,480
Obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm.


450
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,200
This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made.


451
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:21,800
Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns which
he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations.

452
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,480
He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every
animal was at his post.

453
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:35,720
As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball launched
his first attack.

454
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:55,800
All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men
were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.

455
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:04,560
However, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a
little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks.

456
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,400
Snowball now launched his second line of attack.

457
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:17,960
Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and
butted the men from every side, while Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs.

458
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:36,160
But once again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal
from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard.

459
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,400
The men gave a shout of triumph.

460
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,160
They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they
rushed after them in disorder.

461
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,920
This was just what Snowball had intended.

462
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:55,440
As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the
pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off.

463
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,080
Snowball now gave the signal for the charge.

464
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,680
He himself dashed straight for Jones.

465
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,440
Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired.

466
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,440
The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and
a sheep dropped dead.

467
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,680
Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his fifteen stone
against Jones's legs.

468
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,760
Jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of
his hands.

469
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:37,400
But the most terrifying spectacle of all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind
legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion.

470
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,960
His very first blow took a stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull
and stretched him lifeless in the mud.

471
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,280
At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run.


472
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:56,240
Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together
were chasing them round and round the yard.

473
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,760
They were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on.

474
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,880
There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance
on them after his own fashion.

475
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:10,400
Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders
and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly.

476
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,360
At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough
to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road.

477
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:27,000
And so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as
they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way.

478
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,920
All the men were gone except one.

479
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:39,600
Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad
who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over.

480
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,680
The boy did not stir.

481
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,040
"He is dead," said Boxer sorrowfully.

482
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,920
"I had no intention of doing that.

483
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,320
I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes.

484
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,120
Who will believe that I did not do this on purpose?"

485
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:02,040
"No sentimentality, comrade!" cried Snowball from whose wounds
the blood was still dripping.

486
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,480
"War is war. The only good human being is a dead one."

487
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:15,320
"I have no wish to take life, not even human life," repeated
Boxer, and his eyes were full of tears.

488
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,920
"Where is Mollie?" exclaimed somebody.

489
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,520
Mollie in fact was missing.

490
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,600
For a moment there was great alarm; it was feared that the men might
have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them.

491
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:35,280
In the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her
head buried among the hay in the manger.

492
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,560
She had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off.

493
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:47,720
And when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the
stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off.

494
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:55,920
The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each
recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice.

495
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,520
An impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately.


496
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:11,600
The flag was run up and 'Beasts of England' was sung a number of times, then the sheep who
had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave.

497
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:20,760
At the graveside Snowball made a little speech, emphasising the
need for all animals to be ready to die for Animal Farm if need be.

498
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:32,480
The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, "Animal
Hero, First Class," which was conferred there and then on Snowball and Boxer.

499
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:42,440
It consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which
had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on Sundays and holidays.

500
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,200
There was also "Animal Hero, Second Class," which was conferred
posthumously on the dead sheep.

501
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,880
There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called.


502
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:00,440
In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that
was where the ambush had been sprung.

503
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:08,240
Mr. Jones's gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was
known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse.

504
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:24,560
It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the Flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year once on
October the twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.

505
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,480
CHAPTER V

506
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:32,480
As winter drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome.

507
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:43,560
She was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had
overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent.

508
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:52,080
On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking
pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water.

509
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,520
But there were also rumours of something more serious.

510
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:06,880
One day, as Mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her
long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, Clover took her aside.

511
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,440
"Mollie," she said, "I have something very serious to say to
you.

512
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:18,920
This morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal
Farm from Foxwood.

513
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,640
One of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing on the other side of
the hedge.

514
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:28,720
And I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I saw this he
was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose.

515
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,640
What does that mean, Mollie?"

516
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:40,640
"He didn' t! I wasn't! It isn't true!" cried Mollie, beginning
to prance about and paw the ground.

517
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,800
"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour
that that man was not stroking your nose?"

518
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:56,880
"It isn't true!" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the face,
and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.

519
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,560
A thought struck Clover.

520
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:06,080
Without saying anything to the others, she went to Mollie's stall
and turned over the straw with her hoof.

521
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:13,120
Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several
bunches of ribbon of different colours.

522
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,640
Three days later Mollie disappeared.

523
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,320
For some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons
reported that they had seen her on the other side of Willingdon.

524
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:33,840
She was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and
black, which was standing outside a public-house.

525
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:42,800
A fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like
a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar.

526
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,280
Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round
her forelock.

527
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,720
She appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said.

528
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,440
None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.

529
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,920
In January there came bitterly hard weather.

530
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,880
The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields.


531
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:10,200
Many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied
themselves with planning out the work of the coming season.

532
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:21,560
It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should
decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.

533
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:28,640
This arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not
been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon.

534
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,160
These two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible.


535
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:48,800
If one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of
them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots.

536
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,320
Each had his own following, and there were some violent debates.


537
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:56,640
At the Meetings Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches,
but Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times.

538
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,240
He was especially successful with the sheep.

539
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:10,200
Of late the sheep had taken to bleating "Four legs good, two legs bad" both
in and out of season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this.

540
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:18,560
It was noticed that they were especially liable to break into "Four
legs good, two legs bad" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches.

541
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:30,560
Snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the 'Farmer and Stockbreeder' which
he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements.

542
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:43,680
He talked learnedly about field drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the
animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage.

543
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:52,520
Napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that
Snowball's would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time.

544
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:57,080
But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one
that took place over the windmill.

545
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:06,040
In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was
a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm.

546
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:18,880
After surveying the ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill,
which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power.

547
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:30,760
This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a
circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine.

548
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:55,720
The animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while
Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation.

549
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:01,400
Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully
worked out.

550
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:15,840
The mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to Mr. Jones 'One Thousand
Useful Things to Do About the House', 'Every Man His Own Bricklayer', and 'Electricity for Beginners'.

551
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:22,640
Snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for
incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on.

552
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,920
He was closeted there for hours at a time.

553
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:39,280
With his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter,
he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement.

554
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:51,640
Gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than
half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive.

555
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,920
All of them came to look at Snowball's drawings at least once
a day.

556
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:04,400
Even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread
on the chalk marks.

557
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,680
Only Napoleon held aloof.

558
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,200
He had declared himself against the windmill from the start.

559
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,760
One day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans.


560
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:38,640
He walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while
contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.

561
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,320
The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill.


562
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,920
Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business.


563
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:55,840
Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would
have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables.

564
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,640
(How these were to be procured, Snowball did not say.)

565
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,680
But he maintained that it could all be done in a year.

566
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:10,840
And thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that
the animals would only need to work three days a week.

567
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:23,120
Napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food
production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death.

568
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:32,320
The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan, "Vote for
Snowball and the three-day week" and "Vote for Napoleon and the full manger."

569
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,480
Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction.


570
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,920
He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful
or that the windmill would save work.

571
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:48,960
Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had
always gone on that is, badly.

572
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,600
Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question
of the defence of the farm.

573
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:13,880
It was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed
they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate Mr. Jones.

574
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:25,120
They had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across
the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever.

575
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,920
As usual, Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement.

576
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:38,360
According to Napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure
firearms and train themselves in the use of them.

577
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:46,840
According to Snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons
and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms.

578
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:57,560
The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the
other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves.

579
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:09,200
The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was
right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.

580
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:14,400
At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed.

581
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:21,960
At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether
or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote.

582
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:34,000
When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted
by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill.

583
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,360
Then Napoleon stood up to reply.

584
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:52,440
He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat
down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced.

585
01:08:52,440 --> 01:09:01,840
At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had
begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill.

586
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:09,960
Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their
sympathies, but in a moment Snowball's eloquence had carried them away.

587
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:18,000
In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it
might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals' backs.

588
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,760
His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers.


589
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:35,040
Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders,
besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater.

590
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,120
By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to
which way the vote would go.

591
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:52,240
But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at
Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.

592
01:09:52,240 --> 01:10:03,040
At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous
dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn.

593
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:09,160
They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place
just in time to escape their snapping jaws.

594
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,160
In a moment he was out of the door and they were after him.

595
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,560
Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through
the door to watch the chase.

596
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,760
Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road.


597
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,120
He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close
on his heels.

598
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,000
Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him.

599
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,320
Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs
were gaining on him again.

600
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,800
One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball
whisked it free just in time.

601
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:43,760
Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare,
slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.

602
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,240
Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn.

603
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,200
In a moment the dogs came bounding back.

604
01:10:53,200 --> 01:11:05,360
At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon
solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately.

605
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,920
Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking
as wolves.

606
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,040
They kept close to Napoleon.

607
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:22,560
It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same
way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

608
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:32,680
Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion
of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech.

609
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,880
He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would
come to an end.

610
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,600
They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time.

611
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:50,520
In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be
settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself.

612
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:55,640
These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their
decisions to the others.

613
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:06,560
The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing 'Beasts of
England', and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.

614
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:14,320
In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them,
the animals were dismayed by this announcement.

615
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,160
Several of them would have protested if they could have found
the right arguments.

616
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,360
Even Boxer was vaguely troubled.

617
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:33,640
He set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to
marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say.

618
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,320
Some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate.

619
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:47,080
Four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval,
and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once.

620
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:55,880
But suddenly the dogs sitting round Napoleon let out deep, menacing
growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again.

621
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:08,800
Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!"
which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion.

622
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,040
Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new
arrangement to the others.

623
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:25,400
"Comrades," he said, "I trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice
that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself.

624
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,200
Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure!

625
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,000
On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility.

626
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,520
No one believes more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals
are equal.

627
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,160
He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for
yourselves.

628
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:49,120
But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and
then where should we be?

629
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:57,520
Suppose you had decided to follow Snowball, with his moonshine of
windmills Snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"

630
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,920
"He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed," said somebody.


631
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,480
"Bravery is not enough," said Squealer.

632
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,600
"Loyalty and obedience are more important.

633
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:16,720
And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come
when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated.

634
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,400
Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!

635
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,200
That is the watchword for today.

636
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:25,000
One false step, and our enemies would be upon us.

637
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,200
Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?"

638
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,040
Once again this argument was unanswerable.

639
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:41,640
Certainly the animals did not want Jones back; if the holding of debates on
Sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop.

640
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:53,320
Boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general
feeling by saying: "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."

641
01:14:53,320 --> 01:15:03,200
And from then on he adopted the maxim, "Napoleon is always
right," in addition to his private motto of "I will work harder."

642
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:09,600
By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing
had begun.

643
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:17,480
The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been
shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor.

644
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:24,160
Every Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in
the big barn to receive their orders for the week.

645
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:33,960
The skull of old Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the
orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun.

646
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:41,920
After the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file
past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn.

647
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,200
Nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the
past.

648
01:15:47,200 --> 01:16:03,920
Napoleon, with Squealer and another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the
front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind.

649
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,000
The rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the
barn.

650
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:19,760
Napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and
after a single singing of 'Beasts of England', all the animals dispersed.

651
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:30,920
On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat
surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all.

652
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:42,640
He did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that
this extra task would mean very hard work, it might even be necessary to reduce their rations.

653
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,040
The plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail.


654
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:52,080
A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the
past three weeks.

655
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:57,800
The building of the windmill, with various other improvements,
was expected to take two years.

656
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:06,200
That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals
that Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill.

657
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:17,920
On the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which Snowball had
drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among Napoleon's papers.

658
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,840
The windmill was, in fact, Napoleon's own creation.

659
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:28,640
Why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against
it?

660
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,520
Here Squealer looked very sly.

661
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:34,000
That, he said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning.

662
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,560
He had SEEMED to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get
rid of Snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence.

663
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,720
Now that Snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward
without his interference.

664
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,000
This, said Squealer, was something called tactics.

665
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,280
He repeated a number of times, "Tactics, comrades, tactics!"
skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh.

666
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:15,240
The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who
happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.

667
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:15,800
CHAPTER VI

668
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,320
All that year the animals worked like slaves.

669
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:34,360
But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the
benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.

670
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:44,000
Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in August
Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday afternoons as well.

671
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:52,120
This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented
himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.

672
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:57,200
Even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone.


673
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:08,480
The harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been
sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough.

674
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,640
It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a
hard one.

675
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:18,360
The windmill presented unexpected difficulties.

676
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:28,240
There was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been
found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand.

677
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:35,720
But the problem the animals could not at first solve was how
to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size.

678
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:43,800
There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which
no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs.

679
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:52,280
Only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody-namely,
to utilise the force of gravity.

680
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:58,160
Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying
all over the bed of the quarry.

681
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:17,360
The animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope even the pigs sometimes joined in at
critical moments they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below.

682
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:22,600
Transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively
simple.

683
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:32,880
The horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even
Muriel and Benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share.

684
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:41,120
By late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and
then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.

685
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,920
But it was a slow, laborious process.

686
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:53,600
Frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the
top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break.

687
01:20:53,600 --> 01:21:01,000
Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength
seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together.

688
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:12,320
When the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down
the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop.

689
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:24,720
To see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs
clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration.

690
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:31,920
Clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself,
but Boxer would never listen to her.

691
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:41,320
His two slogans, "I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always
right," seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems.

692
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:48,120
He had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters
of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour.

693
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:58,960
And in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the
quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted.

694
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,760
The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite
of the hardness of their work.

695
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:12,200
If they had no more food than they had had in Jones's day, at
least they did not have less.

696
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:23,400
The advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant
human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it.

697
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:29,120
And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient
and saved labour.

698
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:35,040
Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness
impossible to human beings.

699
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:45,120
And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture
from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates.

700
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:52,680
Nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages
began to make them selves felt.

701
01:22:52,680 --> 01:23:01,960
There was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron
for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm.

702
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:11,240
Later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures,
besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill.

703
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,560
How these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine.

704
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:24,760
One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their
orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy.

705
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:37,960
From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for
any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.

706
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,480
The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said.


707
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:55,760
He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if
more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in Willingdon.

708
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:03,520
The hens, said Napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their
own special contribution towards the building of the windmill.

709
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:09,120
Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness.

710
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:25,240
Never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money had not
these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled?

711
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:31,760
All the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least
they thought that they remembered it.

712
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:42,640
The four young pigs who had protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their
voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs.

713
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:52,840
Then, as usual, the sheep broke into "Four legs good, two legs
bad!" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over.

714
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:59,560
Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced
that he had already made all the arrangements.

715
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:06,280
There would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact
with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable.

716
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,000
He intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders.

717
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:21,880
A Mr. Whymper, a solicitor living in Willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between Animal Farm
and the outside world, and would visit the farm every Monday morning to receive his instructions.

718
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:32,120
Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of "Long live Animal Farm!"
and after the singing of 'Beasts of England' the animals were dismissed.

719
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:37,960
Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals'
minds at rest.

720
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:45,320
He assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade
and using money had never been passed, or even suggested.

721
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:51,280
It was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning
to lies circulated by Snowball.

722
01:25:51,280 --> 01:26:01,120
A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but Squealer asked them shrewdly,
"Are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades?

723
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,920
Have you any record of such a resolution?

724
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,800
Is it written down anywhere?"

725
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:13,080
And since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in
writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken.

726
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,680
Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged.


727
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:32,040
He was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have
realised earlier than anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having.

728
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:38,240
The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread,
and avoided him as much as possible.

729
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:49,120
Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to Whymper, who
stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement.

730
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:55,480
Their relations with the human race were now not quite the same
as they had been before.

731
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:02,760
The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it
was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever.

732
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:11,440
Every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go
bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure.

733
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:22,240
They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the
windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work.

734
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:29,800
And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for
the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.

735
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:38,440
One symptom of this was that they had begun to call Animal Farm by its
proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the Manor Farm.

736
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:46,680
They had also dropped their championship of Jones, who had given up hope
of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county.

737
01:27:46,680 --> 01:28:07,520
Except through Whymper, there was as yet no contact between Animal Farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that Napoleon was about to enter
into a definite business agreement either with Mr. Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.

738
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:15,600
It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the
farmhouse and took up their residence there.

739
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:27,240
Again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in
the early days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case.

740
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:34,320
It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were
the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in.

741
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:45,880
It was also more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to
speaking of Napoleon under the title of "Leader") to live in a house than in a mere sty.

742
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:57,520
Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their
meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds.

743
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:13,800
Boxer passed it off as usual with "Napoleon is always right!", but Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling
against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven Commandments which were inscribed there.

744
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:19,160
Finding herself unable to read more than individual letters,
she fetched Muriel.

745
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:24,280
"Muriel," she said, "read me the Fourth Commandment.

746
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:27,840
Does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?"

747
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,440
With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.

748
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:38,560
"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,"' she
announced finally.

749
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:48,480
Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment
mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.

750
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:56,640
And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two
or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective.

751
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:02,480
"You have heard then, comrades," he said, "that we pigs now sleep
in the beds of the farmhouse?

752
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,800
And why not?

753
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,760
You did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against
beds?

754
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,440
A bed merely means a place to sleep in.

755
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:15,000
A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded.

756
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,240
The rule was against sheets, which are a human invention.

757
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:23,960
We have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep
between blankets.

758
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,160
And very comfortable beds they are too!

759
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:33,000
But not more comfortable than we need, I can tell you, comrades,
with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays.

760
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,200
You would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades?

761
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,120
You would not have us too tired to carry out our duties?

762
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,000
Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?"

763
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:50,440
The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more
was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds.

764
01:30:50,440 --> 01:31:00,280
And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an
hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.

765
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:05,200
By the autumn the animals were tired but happy.

766
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:16,800
They had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of
food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything.

767
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,040
It was almost half built now.

768
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:33,080
After the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well
worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot.

769
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:39,920
Boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two
on his own by the light of the harvest moon.

770
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:53,720
In their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and
perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing.

771
01:31:53,720 --> 01:32:04,320
Only old Benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual,
he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time.

772
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:09,280
November came, with raging south-west winds.

773
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,920
Building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement.


774
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:21,440
Finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings
rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn.

775
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:28,080
The hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all
dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance.

776
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:37,480
In the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been
blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish.

777
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:43,760
They had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every
animal's throat.

778
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,640
A terrible sight had met their eyes.

779
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,760
The windmill was in ruins.

780
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,080
With one accord they dashed down to the spot.

781
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:57,440
Napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them
all.

782
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:09,040
Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations,
the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around.

783
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:15,320
Unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the
litter of fallen stone.

784
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:21,360
Napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at
the ground.

785
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:31,120
His tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side,
a sign in him of intense mental activity.

786
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,240
Suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up.

787
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:42,640
"Comrades," he said quietly, "do you know who is responsible
for this?

788
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:50,040
Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown
our windmill?

789
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:56,320
SNOWBALL!" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder.

790
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,680
"Snowball has done this thing!

791
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:11,240
In sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion,
this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year.

792
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:17,680
Comrades, here and now I pronounce the death sentence upon Snowball.


793
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:24,760
'Animal Hero, Second Class,' and half a bushel of apples to any
animal who brings him to justice.

794
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:29,000
A full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"

795
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,400
The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball
could be guilty of such an action.

796
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:42,360
There was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out
ways of catching Snowball if he should ever come back.

797
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:48,920
Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in
the grass at a little distance from the knoll.

798
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:54,800
They could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead
to a hole in the hedge.

799
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,240
Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be Snowball's.


800
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:05,920
He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had probably come from
the direction of Foxwood Farm.

801
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,680
"No more delays, comrades!" cried Napoleon when the footprints
had been examined.

802
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,280
"There is work to be done.

803
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:21,280
This very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will
build all through the winter, rain or shine.

804
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,480
We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our
work so easily.

805
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:33,800
Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans:
they shall be carried out to the day.

806
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,000
Forward, comrades!

807
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,800
Long live the windmill!

808
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,720
Long live Animal Farm!"

809
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,840
CHAPTER VII

810
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,120
It was a bitter winter.

811
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:52,800
The stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by
a hard frost which did not break till well into February.

812
01:35:52,800 --> 01:36:05,800
The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world
was watching them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time.

813
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:16,840
Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was Snowball who had
destroyer the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin.

814
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,800
The animals knew that this was not the case.

815
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:29,640
Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of
eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone.

816
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:34,480
For a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing
could be done.

817
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:44,400
Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel
work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before.

818
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:48,520
They were always cold, and usually hungry as well.

819
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:52,480
Only Boxer and Clover never lost heart.

820
01:36:52,480 --> 01:37:06,800
Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other
animals found more inspiration in Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of "I will work harder!"

821
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,360
In January food fell short.

822
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:17,480
The corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced
that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it.

823
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:24,920
Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had
been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough.

824
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:29,680
The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few
were edible.

825
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:35,040
For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and
mangels.

826
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,240
Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.

827
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:43,080
It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside
world.

828
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:49,720
Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings
were inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm.

829
01:37:49,720 --> 01:38:00,360
Once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that
they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide.

830
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:11,600
Napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food
situation were known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary impression.

831
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:26,480
Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected
animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased.

832
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:37,200
In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly
to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal.

833
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:43,800
On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed
and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins.

834
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:51,480
He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world
that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.

835
01:38:51,480 --> 01:39:00,120
Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that
it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere.

836
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:10,320
In these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time
in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs.

837
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:19,720
When he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of
six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near.

838
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:27,720
Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued
his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.

839
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:36,200
One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had
just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs.

840
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:41,480
Napoleon had accepted, through Whymper, a contract for four hundred
eggs a week.

841
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:47,920
The price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep
the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier.

842
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,200
When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry.

843
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:58,680
They had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary,
but had not believed that it would really happen.

844
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:04,800
They were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting,
and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder.

845
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:10,520
For the first time since the expulsion of Jones, there was something
resembling a rebellion.

846
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:17,680
Led by three young Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined
effort to thwart Napoleon's wishes.

847
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:23,800
Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their
eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor.

848
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,720
Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly.

849
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:35,400
He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal
giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death.

850
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,720
The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out.

851
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:45,760
For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went
back to their nesting boxes.

852
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,280
Nine hens had died in the meantime.

853
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:55,400
Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out
that they had died of coccidiosis.

854
01:40:55,400 --> 01:41:03,880
Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered,
a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away.

855
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:08,880
All this while no more had been seen of Snowball.

856
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:14,720
He was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms,
either Foxwood or Pinchfield.

857
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:20,160
Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other
farmers than before.

858
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:28,000
It happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been
stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared.

859
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:37,000
It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised Napoleon to sell
it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious to buy it.

860
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,800
Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his
mind.

861
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:55,920
It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared
to be in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.

862
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:01,440
Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered.


863
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,480
Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night!

864
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,440
The animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in
their stalls.

865
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:16,880
Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of
darkness and performed all kinds of mischief.

866
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:25,480
He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he
trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.

867
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:30,360
Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it
to Snowball.

868
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:43,640
If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done
it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well.

869
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:49,880
Curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the
mislaid key was found under a sack of meal.

870
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:55,600
The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their
stalls and milked them in their sleep.

871
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:01,320
The rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said
to be in league with Snowball.

872
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:07,200
Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into
Snowball's activities.

873
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:16,160
With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection
of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance.

874
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:25,520
At every few steps Napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces
of Snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell.

875
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:35,080
He snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses,
in the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball almost everywhere.

876
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:44,920
He would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs,
ad exclaim in a terrible voice, "Snowball!

877
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,040
He has been here!

878
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:56,600
I can smell him distinctly!" and at the word "Snowball" all the
dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth.

879
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,360
The animals were thoroughly frightened.

880
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:08,680
It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence,
pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers.

881
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:16,840
In the evening Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed
expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report.

882
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:23,440
"Comrades!" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, "a most
terrible thing has been discovered.

883
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:30,800
Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is
even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us!

884
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,400
Snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins.

885
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,160
But there is worse than that.

886
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:41,400
We had thought that Snowball's rebellion was caused simply by
his vanity and ambition.

887
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:42,840
But we were wrong, comrades.

888
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,120
Do you know what the real reason was?

889
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:49,640
Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start!

890
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,240
He was Jones's secret agent all the time.

891
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:58,760
It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him
and which we have only just discovered.

892
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,440
To my mind this explains a great deal, comrades.

893
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:10,400
Did we not see for ourselves how he attempted fortunately without
success to get us defeated and destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?"

894
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,760
The animals were stupefied.

895
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:16,920
This was a wickedness far outdoing Snowball's destruction of
the windmill.

896
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,560
But it was some minutes before they could fully take it in.

897
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:36,520
They all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had
rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from Jones's gun had wounded his back.

898
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:42,320
At first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in
with his being on Jones's side.

899
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:46,640
Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled.

900
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:54,840
He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes,
and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.

901
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:59,080
"I do not believe that," he said.

902
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:09,840
"Snowball fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed. I saw him myself.
Did we not give him ' Animal Hero, first Class,' immediately afterwards?"

903
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,040
"That was our mistake, comrade.

904
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:19,760
For we know now it is all written down in the secret documents that
we have found that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom."

905
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,640
"But he was wounded," said Boxer.

906
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,560
"We all saw him running with blood."

907
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,960
"That was part of the arrangement!" cried Squealer.

908
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,280
"Jones's shot only grazed him.

909
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,400
I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to
read it.

910
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:41,400
The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the
signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy.

911
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:48,120
And he very nearly succeeded I will even say, comrades, he WOULD have
succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.

912
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:57,680
Do you not remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside
the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him?

913
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:10,400
And do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost,
that Comrade Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank his teeth in Jones's leg?

914
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:15,680
Surely you remember THAT, comrades?" exclaimed Squealer, frisking
from side to side.

915
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:23,920
Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed
to the animals that they did remember it.

916
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:29,720
At any rate, they remembered that at the critical moment of the
battle Snowball had turned to flee.

917
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,880
But Boxer was still a little uneasy.

918
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:39,720
"I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning,"
he said finally.

919
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:48,760
"What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the
Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade."

920
01:47:48,760 --> 01:48:08,040
"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," announced Squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, "has stated categorically categorically,
comrade that Snowball was Jones's agent from the very beginning yes, and from long before the Rebellion was ever thought of."

921
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:11,800
"Ah, that is different!" said Boxer.

922
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:17,560
"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."

923
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:25,960
"That is the true spirit, comrade!" cried Squealer, but it was noticed
he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes.

924
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:35,120
He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: "I warn
every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open.

925
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:42,200
For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents
are lurking among us at this moment!"

926
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:49,280
Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all
the animals to assemble in the yard.

927
01:48:49,280 --> 01:49:07,680
When they were all gathered together, Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself "Animal Hero, First
Class", and "Animal Hero, Second Class"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines.

928
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:15,080
They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in
advance that some terrible thing was about to happen.

929
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:22,680
Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered
a high-pitched whimper.

930
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:31,400
Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear
and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleon's feet.

931
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:37,680
The pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and
for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad.

932
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:42,280
To the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves
upon Boxer.

933
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:47,800
Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog
in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground.

934
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:52,000
The dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their
tails between their legs.

935
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,360
Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the
dog to death or let it go.

936
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:08,760
Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered Boxer to let the dog
go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling.

937
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,800
Presently the tumult died down.

938
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:17,480
The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every
line of their countenances.

939
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:21,800
Napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes.

940
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:27,520
They were the same four pigs as had protested when Napoleon abolished
the Sunday Meetings.

941
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:43,520
Without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had
collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick.

942
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:50,760
They added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that
he had been Jones's secret agent for years past.

943
01:50:50,760 --> 01:51:01,400
When they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and
in a terrible voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess.

944
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:14,520
The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward
and stated that Snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders.

945
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,320
They, too, were slaughtered.

946
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:26,160
Then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears
of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in the night.

947
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:43,120
Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball and two other sheep confessed to having
murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough.

948
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,840
They were all slain on the spot.

949
01:51:45,840 --> 01:52:02,960
And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon's
feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.

950
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:11,680
When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs
and dogs, crept away in a body.

951
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:14,200
They were shaken and miserable.

952
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:24,640
They did not know which was more shocking the treachery of the animals who had
leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed.

953
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:35,400
In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it
seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves.

954
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:42,200
Since Jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed
another animal.

955
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,720
Not even a rat had been killed.

956
01:52:44,720 --> 01:53:11,240
They had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth Clover, Muriel,
Benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the animals to assemble.

957
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:14,240
For some time nobody spoke.

958
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,320
Only Boxer remained on his feet.

959
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:26,280
He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against
his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise.

960
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,720
Finally he said:

961
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:31,280
"I do not understand it.

962
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:37,080
I would not have believed that such things could happen on our
farm.

963
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:41,040
It must be due to some fault in ourselves.

964
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:46,240
The solution, as I see it, is to work harder.

965
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:52,480
From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings."


966
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,040
And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry.


967
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:05,160
Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and
dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night.

968
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:10,280
The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking.

969
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:15,040
The knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across
the countryside.

970
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:32,200
Most of Animal Farm was within their view the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the
ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys.

971
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,920
It was a clear spring evening.

972
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:39,560
The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays
of the sun.

973
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:50,240
Never had the farm and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own
farm, every inch of it their own property appeared to the animals so desirable a place.

974
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:55,320
As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears.


975
01:54:55,320 --> 01:55:07,040
If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they
had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race.

976
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:16,640
These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked
forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion.

977
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:37,840
If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according
to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech.

978
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:55,320
Instead she did not know why they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs
roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes.

979
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:00,360
There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind.


980
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:11,320
She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days
of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings.

981
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:21,120
Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the
orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon.

982
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:28,960
But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals
had hoped and toiled.

983
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:35,200
It was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced
the bullets of Jones's gun.

984
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:40,680
Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express
them.

985
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:50,960
At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words
she was unable to find, she began to sing 'Beasts of England'.

986
01:56:50,960 --> 01:57:04,320
The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over
very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.

987
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:15,000
They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer, attended by
two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say.

988
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:22,400
He announced that, by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, 'Beasts
of England' had been abolished.

989
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,680
From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it.

990
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:28,320
The animals were taken aback.

991
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,360
"Why?" cried Muriel.

992
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:36,040
"It's no longer needed, comrade," said Squealer stiffly.

993
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:39,600
"'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion.

994
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,080
But the Rebellion is now completed.

995
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,240
The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act.


996
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:51,160
The enemy both external and internal has been defeated.

997
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:56,960
In 'Beasts of England' we expressed our longing for a better
society in days to come.

998
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,360
But that society has now been established.

999
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,720
Clearly this song has no longer any purpose."

1000
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:21,560
Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their
usual bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad," which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion.

1001
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:26,080
So 'Beasts of England' was heard no more.

1002
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:31,720
In its place Minimus, the poet, had composed another song which
began:

1003
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:37,320
Animal Farm, Animal Farm, Never through me shalt thou come to
harm!

1004
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:41,640
and this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of
the flag.

1005
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:49,960
But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the
animals to come up to 'Beasts of England'.

1006
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:53,880
CHAPTER VIII

1007
01:58:53,880 --> 01:59:08,240
A few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered
or thought they remembered that the Sixth Commandment decreed "No animal shall kill any other animal."

1008
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:17,960
And though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs,
it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this.

1009
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:28,520
Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and when Benjamin,
as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched Muriel.

1010
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,560
Muriel read the Commandment for her.

1011
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:39,440
It ran: "No animal shall kill any other animal WITHOUT CAUSE."


1012
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:44,280
Somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals'
memory.

1013
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:52,880
But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there
was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.

1014
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:58,480
Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they
had worked in the previous year.

1015
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:07,960
To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the
appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour.

1016
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:14,920
There were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked
longer hours and fed no better than they had done in Jones's day.

1017
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:30,240
On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production
of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be.

1018
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:38,840
The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer
remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion.

1019
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:45,360
All the same, there were days when they felt that they would
sooner have had less figures and more food.

1020
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:50,560
All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other
pigs.

1021
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:55,200
Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a
fortnight.

1022
02:00:55,200 --> 02:01:08,960
When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in
front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud "cock-a-doodle-doo" before Napoleon spoke.

1023
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:14,840
Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon inhabited separate
apartments from the others.

1024
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:23,840
He took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the
Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room.

1025
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:31,640
It was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on
Napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries.

1026
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,480
Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as "Napoleon."

1027
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:53,400
He was always referred to in formal style as "our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and this pigs liked to invent for him
such titles as Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings' Friend, and the like.

1028
02:01:53,400 --> 02:02:09,840
In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep
love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms.

1029
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:16,840
It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful
achievement and every stroke of good fortune.

1030
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:34,960
You would often hear one hen remark to another, "Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days";
or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, "Thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!"

1031
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:44,520
The general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled
Comrade Napoleon, which was composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:

1032
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:47,200
Friend of fatherless!

1033
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,960
Fountain of happiness!

1034
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,120
Lord of the swill-bucket!

1035
02:02:51,120 --> 02:03:01,120
Oh, how my soul is on Fire when I gaze at thy Calm and commanding
eye, Like the sun in the sky, Comrade Napoleon!

1036
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:18,880
Thou are the giver of All that thy creatures love, Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;
Every beast great or small Sleeps at peace in his stall, Thou watchest over all, Comrade Napoleon!

1037
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:37,280
Had I a sucking-pig, Ere he had grown as big Even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin, He should
have learned to be Faithful and true to thee, Yes, his first squeak should be "Comrade Napoleon!"

1038
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:46,600
Napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the
wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the Seven Commandments.

1039
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:53,240
It was surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in profile, executed
by Squealer in white paint.

1040
02:03:53,240 --> 02:04:01,000
Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper, Napoleon was engaged
in complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington.

1041
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,960
The pile of timber was still unsold.

1042
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:10,200
Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it,
but he would not offer a reasonable price.

1043
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:20,360
At the same time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack
Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him.

1044
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:24,760
Snowball was known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm.

1045
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:34,920
In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward
and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon.

1046
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:40,280
They were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for Napoleon's
safety were taken.

1047
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:51,640
Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye
was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.

1048
02:04:51,640 --> 02:05:05,720
At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he
was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between Animal Farm and Foxwood.

1049
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:13,280
The relations between Napoleon and Pilkington, though they
were only conducted through Whymper, were now almost friendly.

1050
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:21,480
The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human being, but greatly
preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared and hated.

1051
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:30,160
As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the
rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger.

1052
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:43,800
Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the
magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions.

1053
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:51,000
Moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield
about the cruelties that Frederick practised upon his animals.

1054
02:05:51,000 --> 02:06:03,560
He had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace,
he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs.

1055
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:15,680
The animals' blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things beingdone to their comrades, and sometimes they
clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free.

1056
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:22,000
But Squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust
in Comrade Napoleon's strategy.

1057
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high.


1058
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:39,440
One Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile
of timber to Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description.

1059
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:53,680
The pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on
Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of "Death to Humanity" in favour of "Death to Frederick."

1060
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:59,160
In the late summer yet another of Snowball's machinations was
laid bare.

1061
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:07,920
The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of
his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn.

1062
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:17,120
A gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to Squealer
and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries.

1063
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:27,960
The animals now also learned that Snowball had never as many of them
had believed hitherto received the order of "Animal Hero, First Class."

1064
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:33,600
This was merely a legend which had been spread some time after
the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself.

1065
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:38,840
So far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing
cowardice in the battle.

1066
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:47,720
Once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but
Squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault.

1067
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:59,040
In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort for the harvest
had to be gathered at almost the same time the windmill was finished.

1068
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:06,720
The machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was
negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed.

1069
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:18,640
In the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad
luck and of Snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day!

1070
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:28,400
Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which
appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time.

1071
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,760
Moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before.

1072
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,400
Nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time!

1073
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:54,680
And when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were
turning and the dynamos running when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph.

1074
02:08:54,680 --> 02:09:08,200
Napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally
congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named Napoleon Mill.

1075
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:13,840
Two days later the animals were called together for a special
meeting in the barn.

1076
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:19,880
They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon announced that
he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick.

1077
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:24,480
Tomorrow Frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it
away.

1078
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:31,800
Throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with Pilkington,
Napoleon had really been in secret agreement with Frederick.

1079
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:38,000
All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages
had been sent to Pilkington.

1080
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:45,960
The pigeons had been told to avoid Pinchfield Farm and to alter
their slogan from "Death to Frederick" to "Death to Pilkington."

1081
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:57,280
At the same time Napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were
completely untrue, and that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated.

1082
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:02,040
All these rumours had probably originated with Snowball and his
agents.

1083
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:17,360
It now appeared that Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he
was living in considerable luxury, so it was said at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington for years past.

1084
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:21,480
The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon's cunning.

1085
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:27,440
By seeming to be friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick
to raise his price by twelve pounds.

1086
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:35,200
But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind, said Squealer, was
shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even Frederick.

1087
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:44,720
Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque,
which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it.

1088
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:47,200
But Napoleon was too clever for him.

1089
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:53,400
He had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were
to be handed over before the timber was removed.

1090
02:10:53,400 --> 02:11:00,560
Already Frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just
enough to buy the machinery for the windmill.

1091
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,680
Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed.

1092
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:10,760
When it was all gone, another special meeting was held in the
barn for the animals to inspect Frederick's bank-notes.

1093
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:23,000
Smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the
platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen.

1094
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,880
The animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill.

1095
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:35,840
And Boxer put out his nose to sniff at the bank-notes, and the
flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.

1096
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:39,400
Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo.

1097
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:47,120
Whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle,
flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse.

1098
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:51,960
The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's
apartments.

1099
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:55,720
The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire.


1100
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:58,240
The banknotes were forgeries!

1101
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:00,720
Frederick had got the timber for nothing!

1102
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:07,280
Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible
voice pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick.

1103
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:11,160
When captured, he said, Frederick should be boiled alive.

1104
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:15,760
At the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed
the worst was to be expected.

1105
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:19,360
Frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at
any moment.

1106
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:22,840
Sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm.

1107
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:31,600
In addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory message,
which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with Pilkington.

1108
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:35,240
The very next morning the attack came.

1109
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:42,240
The animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news
that Frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate.

1110
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:49,960
Boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did
not have the easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed.

1111
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:54,040
There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them,

1112
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:57,120
and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards.

1113
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:06,240
The animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in
spite of the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back.

1114
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:08,880
A number of them were already wounded.

1115
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:13,840
They took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously
out from chinks and knot-holes.

1116
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:18,920
The whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in
the hands of the enemy.

1117
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:22,720
For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a loss.

1118
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:26,680
He paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching.


1119
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:30,360
Wistful glances were sent in the direction of Foxwood.

1120
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:33,800
If Pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet
be won.

1121
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:41,800
But at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day
before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington.

1122
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:45,960
On it was pencilled the words: "Serves you right."

1123
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,320
Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill.


1124
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:54,920
The animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round.

1125
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:58,080
Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer.

1126
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,760
They were going to knock the windmill down.

1127
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:03,600
"Impossible!" cried Napoleon.

1128
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:10,280
"We have built the walls far too thick for that. They could not
knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!"

1129
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:14,040
But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently.

1130
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:19,240
The two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole
near the base of the windmill.

1131
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:25,720
Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, Benjamin nodded
his long muzzle.

1132
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:29,080
"I thought so," he said.

1133
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:37,200
"Do you not see what they are doing? In another moment they are
going to pack blasting powder into that hole."

1134
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:40,240
Terrified, the animals waited.

1135
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:44,000
It was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings.


1136
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,760
After a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions.


1137
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,200
Then there was a deafening roar.

1138
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:58,000
The pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except
Napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces.

1139
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:04,520
When they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging
where the windmill had been.

1140
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,040
Slowly the breeze drifted it away.

1141
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:10,800
The windmill had ceased to exist!

1142
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,960
At this sight the animals' courage returned to them.

1143
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:21,800
The fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned
in their rage against this vile, contemptible act.

1144
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:29,280
A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further
orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy.

1145
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,440
This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over
them like hail.

1146
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:35,720
It was a savage, bitter battle.

1147
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:41,640
The men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close
quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots.

1148
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:47,040
A cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone
was wounded.

1149
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:52,800
Even Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had
the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet.

1150
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:55,240
But the men did not go unscathed either.

1151
02:15:55,240 --> 02:16:04,720
Three of them had their heads broken by blows from Boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the
belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by Jessie and Bluebell.

1152
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:15,600
And when the nine dogs of Napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under
cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them.

1153
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:18,360
They saw that they were in danger of being surrounded.

1154
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:24,640
Frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good,
and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life.

1155
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:31,280
The animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in
some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge.

1156
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:35,880
They had won, but they were weary and bleeding.

1157
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:39,320
Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm.

1158
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:44,840
The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved
some of them to tears.

1159
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:51,400
And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the
place where the windmill had once stood.

1160
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:57,800
Yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone!


1161
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:01,120
Even the foundations were partially destroyed.

1162
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:06,680
And in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make
use of the fallen stones.

1163
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:09,120
This time the stones had vanished too.

1164
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,320
The force of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds
of yards.

1165
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:16,520
It was as though the windmill had never been.

1166
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:28,920
As they approached the farm Squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the
fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction.

1167
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:34,800
And the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings,
the solemn booming of a gun.

1168
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:39,640
"What is that gun firing for?" said Boxer.

1169
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:43,160
"To celebrate our victory!" cried Squealer.

1170
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:46,600
"What victory?" said Boxer.

1171
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:53,760
His knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof,
and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg.

1172
02:17:53,760 --> 02:18:01,200
"What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our
soil the sacred soil of Animal Farm?"

1173
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:07,200
"But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it
for two years!"

1174
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,200
"What matter?

1175
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:09,760
We will build another windmill.

1176
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:12,360
We will build six windmills if we feel like it.

1177
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:15,840
You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have
done.

1178
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,720
The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand
upon.

1179
02:18:19,720 --> 02:18:26,240
And now thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon we have
won every inch of it back again!"

1180
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:30,600
"Then we have won back what we had before," said Boxer.

1181
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,560
"That is our victory," said Squealer.

1182
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:36,240
They limped into the yard.

1183
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:40,200
The pellets under the skin of Boxer's leg smarted painfully.

1184
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:50,040
He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the
foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task.

1185
02:18:50,040 --> 02:19:00,800
But for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old
and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been.

1186
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:18,120
But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again seven times it was fired in all and heard the
speech that Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory.

1187
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:22,200
The animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral.

1188
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:29,400
Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and
Napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession.

1189
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:33,400
Two whole days were given over to celebrations.

1190
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:44,440
There were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was
bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog.

1191
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:56,800
It was announced that the battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon
had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had conferred upon himself.

1192
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:02,640
In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes
was forgotten.

1193
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:12,920
It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case
of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse.

1194
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:16,760
It had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied.


1195
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:27,600
That night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which,
to everyone's surprise, the strains of 'Beasts of England' were mixed up.

1196
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:41,440
At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly
seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again.

1197
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:46,880
But in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse.

1198
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:49,640
Not a pig appeared to be stirring.

1199
02:20:49,640 --> 02:21:03,400
It was nearly nine o'clock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his
eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill.

1200
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:09,920
He called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible
piece of news to impart.

1201
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,360
Comrade Napoleon was dying!

1202
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:16,600
A cry of lamentation went up.

1203
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:21,960
Straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the
animals walked on tiptoe.

1204
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:28,480
With tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should
do if their Leader were taken away from them.

1205
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:35,840
A rumour went round that Snowball had after all contrived to
introduce poison into Napoleon's food.

1206
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:40,120
At eleven o'clock Squealer came out to make another announcement.


1207
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:51,560
As his last act upon earth, Comrade Napoleon had pronounced a
solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death.

1208
02:21:51,560 --> 02:22:02,880
By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following
morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery.

1209
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:13,720
By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that
he had instructed Whymper to purchase in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling.

1210
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:27,040
A week later Napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously
been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up.

1211
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:36,040
It was given out that the pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding;
but it soon became known that Napoleon intended to sow it with barley.

1212
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:43,240
About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly
anyone was able to understand.

1213
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:50,760
One night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud crash in the
yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls.

1214
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,880
It was a moonlit night.

1215
02:22:52,880 --> 02:23:00,760
At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the Seven
Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces.

1216
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:12,160
Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand
there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint.

1217
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:19,120
The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and escorted
him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk.

1218
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:31,480
None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old Benjamin, who
nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing.

1219
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:42,480
But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to herself,
noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong.

1220
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:51,320
They had thought the Fifth Commandment was "No animal shall
drink alcohol," but there were two words that they had forgotten.

1221
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:57,440
Actually the Commandment read: "No animal shall drink alcohol
TO EXCESS."

1222
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,960
CHAPTER IX

1223
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:05,520
Boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing.

1224
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:10,600
They had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after
the victory celebrations were ended.

1225
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:17,480
Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point
of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain.

1226
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:23,040
In the evenings he would admit privately to Clover that the hoof
troubled him a great deal.

1227
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:32,800
Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by
chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard.

1228
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:37,080
"A horse's lungs do not last for ever," she said to him.

1229
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,120
But Boxer would not listen.

1230
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:46,960
He had, he said, only one real ambition left to see the windmill
well under way before he reached the age for retirement.

1231
02:24:46,960 --> 02:25:04,640
At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses
and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five.

1232
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:08,360
Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon.

1233
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:15,960
As yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late
the subject had been discussed more and more.

1234
02:25:15,960 --> 02:25:27,240
Now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner
of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals.

1235
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:38,320
For a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in
winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays.

1236
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:43,400
Boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following
year.

1237
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:46,800
Meanwhile life was hard.

1238
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:51,720
The winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was
even shorter.

1239
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:56,880
Once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs
and the dogs.

1240
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:04,040
A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have
been contrary to the principles of Animalism.

1241
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:11,960
In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they
were NOT in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be.

1242
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:26,360
For the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of
it as a "readjustment," never as a "reduction"), but in comparison with the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous.

1243
02:26:26,360 --> 02:26:49,200
Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their
drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas.

1244
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,920
The animals believed every word of it.

1245
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:57,920
Truth to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out
of their memories.

1246
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:07,200
They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry
and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep.

1247
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:10,880
But doubtless it had been worse in the old days.

1248
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,880
They were glad to believe so.

1249
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:21,800
Besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and
that made all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.

1250
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:25,200
There were many more mouths to feed now.

1251
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:32,440
In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously,
producing thirty-one young pigs between them.

1252
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:41,360
The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar
on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage.

1253
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:49,280
It was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been
purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden.

1254
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:55,640
For the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction
by Napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen.

1255
02:27:55,640 --> 02:28:01,480
They took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged
from playing with the other young animals.

1256
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:18,680
About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand
aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.

1257
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:25,120
The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short
of money.

1258
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:33,600
There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it
would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill.

1259
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:50,840
Then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground
that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits.

1260
02:28:50,840 --> 02:29:03,600
A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six
hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level.

1261
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:11,800
Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in February,
and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil.

1262
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:17,760
But the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting
on weight if anything.

1263
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:32,640
One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself
across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been disused in Jones's time, and which stood beyond the kitchen.

1264
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:35,840
Someone said it was the smell of cooking barley.

1265
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:41,720
The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm
mash was being prepared for their supper.

1266
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:50,280
But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced
that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.

1267
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:54,720
The field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley.


1268
02:29:54,720 --> 02:30:07,360
And the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with
half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the Crown Derby soup tureen.

1269
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:17,440
But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the
fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before.

1270
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:22,200
There were more songs, more speeches, more processions.

1271
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:34,240
Napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a Spontaneous
Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm.

1272
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:47,840
At the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military
formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry.

1273
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:53,760
The dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched
Napoleon's black cockerel.

1274
02:30:53,760 --> 02:31:03,040
Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with
the hoof and the horn and the caption, "Long live Comrade Napoleon!"

1275
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:17,400
Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon's honour, and a speech by Squealer giving
particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun.

1276
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:39,880
The sheep were the greatest devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that
they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs bad!"

1277
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:43,640
But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations.

1278
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:51,640
They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly
their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit.

1279
02:31:51,640 --> 02:32:06,600
So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the
cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.

1280
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:15,080
In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became
necessary to elect a President.

1281
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:20,720
There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.


1282
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:29,280
On the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered
which revealed further details about Snowball's complicity with Jones.

1283
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:42,200
It now appeared that Snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to
lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on Jones's side.

1284
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:50,880
In fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and
had charged into battle with the words "Long live Humanity!" on his lips.

1285
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:58,200
The wounds on Snowball's back, which a few of the animals still
remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by Napoleon's teeth.

1286
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:06,840
In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared
on the farm, after an absence of several years.

1287
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:14,080
He was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the
same strain as ever about Sugarcandy Mountain.

1288
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:20,360
He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by
the hour to anyone who would listen.

1289
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:40,240
"Up there, comrades," he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak "up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud
that you can see there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!"

1290
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:49,880
He even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the
everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges.

1291
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:52,360
Many of the animals believed him.

1292
02:33:52,360 --> 02:34:00,400
Their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it
not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else?

1293
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:05,920
A thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the
pigs towards Moses.

1294
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:18,160
They all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and yet
they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.

1295
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:23,720
After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever.

1296
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:27,120
Indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year.

1297
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:34,840
Apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill,
there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March.

1298
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:42,160
Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear,
but Boxer never faltered.

1299
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:47,520
In nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength
was not what it had been.

1300
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:57,800
It was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less
shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken.

1301
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:06,960
The others said, "Boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes
on"; but the spring came and Boxer grew no fatter.

1302
02:35:06,960 --> 02:35:19,440
Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the
weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue.

1303
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:28,600
At such times his lips were seen to form the words, "I will work
harder"; he had no voice left.

1304
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:35,680
Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take care of his
health, but Boxer paid no attention.

1305
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:38,400
His twelfth birthday was approaching.

1306
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:45,320
He did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone
was accumulated before he went on pension.

1307
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:52,760
Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the
farm that something had happened to Boxer.

1308
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:56,600
He had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill.


1309
02:35:56,600 --> 02:35:59,680
And sure enough, the rumour was true.

1310
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:05,600
A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news;
"Boxer has fallen!

1311
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,120
He is lying on his side and can't get up!"

1312
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:12,920
About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where
the windmill stood.

1313
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:20,720
There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched
out, unable even to raise his head.

1314
02:36:20,720 --> 02:36:24,600
His eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat.

1315
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:27,800
A thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth.

1316
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:31,240
Clover dropped to her knees at his side.

1317
02:36:31,240 --> 02:36:35,480
"Boxer!" she cried, "how are you?"

1318
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:39,360
"It is my lung," said Boxer in a weak voice.

1319
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:41,160
"It does not matter.

1320
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:45,120
I think you will be able to finish the windmill without me.

1321
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:49,200
There is a pretty good store of stone accumulated.

1322
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,520
I had only another month to go in any case.

1323
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:57,640
To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement.


1324
02:36:57,640 --> 02:37:07,200
And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him
retire at the same time and be a companion to me."

1325
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,760
"We must get help at once," said Clover.

1326
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:13,680
"Run, somebody, and tell Squealer what has happened."

1327
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:18,320
All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse
to give Squealer the news.

1328
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:26,520
Only Clover remained, and Benjamin who lay down at Boxer's side,
and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail.

1329
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:31,920
After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of sympathy
and concern.

1330
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:43,920
He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal
workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon.

1331
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:47,320
The animals felt a little uneasy at this.

1332
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:57,760
Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and
they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings.

1333
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:06,520
However, Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon
could treat Boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm.

1334
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:20,040
And about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet,
and managed to limp back to his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him.

1335
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:23,760
For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall.

1336
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:33,400
The pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine
chest in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day after meals.

1337
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:39,480
In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while
Benjamin kept the flies off him.

1338
02:38:39,480 --> 02:38:42,920
Boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened.

1339
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:51,840
If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked
forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture.

1340
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:56,400
It would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and
improve his mind.

1341
02:38:56,400 --> 02:39:03,200
He intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning
the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet.

1342
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:12,800
However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours,
and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away.

1343
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:24,920
The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to
see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice.

1344
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:31,360
It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin excited
indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop.

1345
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:33,560
"Quick, quick !" he shouted.

1346
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:36,360
"Come at once! They' re taking Boxer away!"

1347
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:42,400
Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off
work and raced back to the farm buildings.

1348
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:53,200
Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering
on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat.

1349
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,800
And Boxer's stall was empty.

1350
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:58,480
The animals crowded round the van.

1351
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:01,680
"Good-bye, Boxer!" they chorused, "good-bye!"

1352
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:07,560
"Fools! Fools!" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping
the earth with his small hoofs.

1353
02:40:07,560 --> 02:40:11,840
"Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?"


1354
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:15,040
That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush.

1355
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,840
Muriel began to spell out the words.

1356
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:21,920
But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence
he read:

1357
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:28,200
"'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.


1358
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:31,200
Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal.

1359
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,000
Kennels Supplied.'

1360
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,120
Do you not understand what that means?

1361
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:39,160
They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!"

1362
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:42,120
A cry of horror burst from all the animals.

1363
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:47,840
At this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the
van moved out of the yard at a smart trot.

1364
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:51,480
All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices.


1365
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:53,480
Clover forced her way to the front.

1366
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:55,320
The van began to gather speed.

1367
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:59,560
Clover tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved
a canter.

1368
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:01,280
"Boxer!" she cried.

1369
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:04,000
"Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!"

1370
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:12,160
And just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face, with
the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.

1371
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:15,320
"Boxer!" cried Clover in a terrible voice.

1372
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:20,480
"Boxer! Get out! Get out quickly! They' re taking you to your
death!"

1373
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:24,600
All the animals took up the cry of "Get out, Boxer, get out!"


1374
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:27,520
But the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from
them.

1375
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:30,880
It was uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had
said.

1376
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:37,040
But a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there
was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van.

1377
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:38,560
He was trying to kick his way out.

1378
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:43,040
The time had been when a few kicks from Boxer's hoofs would have
smashed the van to matchwood.

1379
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:50,200
But alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the
sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away.

1380
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:55,200
In desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses
which drew the van to stop.

1381
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:57,680
"Comrades, comrades!" they shouted.

1382
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,920
"Don't take your own brother to his death!"

1383
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:05,960
But the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening,
merely set back their ears and quickened their pace.

1384
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:09,240
Boxer's face did not reappear at the window.

1385
02:42:09,240 --> 02:42:17,160
Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but
in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road.

1386
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:20,880
Boxer was never seen again.

1387
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:29,800
Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at
Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.

1388
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:33,000
Squealer came to announce the news to the others.

1389
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,720
He had, he said, been present during Boxer's last hours.

1390
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:43,920
"It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!" said Squealer,
lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear.

1391
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:46,720
"I was at his bedside at the very last.

1392
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:57,440
And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that
his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished.

1393
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:00,440
'Forward, comrades!' he whispered.

1394
02:43:00,440 --> 02:43:03,160
'Forward in the name of the Rebellion.

1395
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:05,560
Long live Animal Farm!

1396
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:08,480
Long live Comrade Napoleon!

1397
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:11,400
Napoleon is always right.'

1398
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:16,680
Those were his very last words, comrades."

1399
02:43:16,680 --> 02:43:18,280
Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed.

1400
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:26,000
He fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious
glances from side to side before he proceeded.

1401
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:34,040
It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked
rumour had been circulated at the time of Boxer's removal.

1402
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:45,920
Some of the animals had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked "Horse Slaughterer,"
and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was being sent to the knacker's.

1403
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:50,760
It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer, that any animal could
be so stupid.

1404
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:59,960
Surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side,
surely they knew their beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that?

1405
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:02,960
But the explanation was really very simple.

1406
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:12,040
The van had previously been the property of the knacker, and had been
bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old name out.

1407
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:14,920
That was how the mistake had arisen.

1408
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:18,480
The animals were enormously relieved to hear this.

1409
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:38,000
And when Squealer went on to give further graphic details of Boxer's death-bed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which Napoleon had paid without
a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.

1410
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:45,840
Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday
morning and pronounced a short oration in Boxer's honour.

1411
02:44:45,840 --> 02:45:00,840
It had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for interment on the farm, but he had
ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer's grave.

1412
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:07,240
And in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial
banquet in Boxer's honour.

1413
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:23,280
Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxer's two favourite maxims, "I will work harder" and
"Comrade Napoleon is always right" maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own.

1414
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:31,240
On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from
Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse.

1415
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:42,040
That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded
like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass.

1416
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:54,640
No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that
from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.

1417
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:54,920
CHAPTER X

1418
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:58,840
TEN YEARS passed.

1419
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:03,760
The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by.

1420
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:14,960
A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the
Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of the pigs.

1421
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:20,200
Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead.

1422
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:25,320
Jones too was dead-he had died in an inebriates' home in another
part of the country.

1423
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:27,600
Snowball was forgotten.

1424
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:32,000
Boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him.

1425
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:38,600
Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with
a tendency to rheumy eyes.

1426
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:45,760
She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal
had ever actually retired.

1427
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:52,640
The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated
animals had long since been dropped.

1428
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:58,120
Napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone.

1429
02:46:58,120 --> 02:47:03,040
Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of
his eyes.

1430
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:14,600
Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer
about the muzzle, and, since Boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever.

1431
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:22,160
There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the
increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years.

1432
02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:33,800
Many animals had been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of
mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival.

1433
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:38,160
The farm possessed three horses now besides Clover.

1434
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:44,520
They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades,
but very stupid.

1435
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:48,200
None of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter
B.

1436
02:47:48,200 --> 02:48:01,360
They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from
Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it.

1437
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:11,160
The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even
been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington.

1438
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:22,200
The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing
machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it.

1439
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:25,080
Whymper had bought himself a dogcart.

1440
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:30,520
The windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating
electrical power.

1441
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:35,360
It was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money
profit.

1442
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:44,000
The animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that
one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed.

1443
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:56,120
But the luxuries of which Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with
electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about.

1444
02:48:56,120 --> 02:49:01,240
Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of
Animalism.

1445
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:06,920
The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living
frugally.

1446
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:17,680
Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the
animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs.

1447
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:23,040
Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so
many dogs.

1448
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:27,760
It was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion.


1449
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:34,400
There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless
work in the supervision and organisation of the farm.

1450
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:39,000
Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too
ignorant to understand.

1451
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:50,240
For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every
day upon mysterious things called "files," "reports," "minutes," and "memoranda."

1452
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:58,840
These were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with
writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace.

1453
02:49:58,840 --> 02:50:03,440
This was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm,
Squealer said.

1454
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:14,160
But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour;
and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good

1455
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:14,160
.

1456
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:20,360
As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it
had always been.

1457
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:31,640
They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured
in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies.

1458
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:46,600
Sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early
days of the Rebellion, when Jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now.

1459
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:48,520
They could not remember.

1460
02:50:48,520 --> 02:51:00,080
There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except
Squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better.

1461
02:51:00,080 --> 02:51:07,080
The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had
little time for speculating on such things now.

1462
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:16,640
Only old Benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long
life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be

1463
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:17,080
much

1464
02:51:17,080 --> 02:51:18,640
better or much worse

1465
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:25,400
-hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the
unalterable law of life.

1466
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:29,200
And yet the animals never gave up hope.

1467
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:36,640
More, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour
and privilege in being members of Animal Farm.

1468
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:43,840
They were still the only farm in the whole county - in all England!
- owned and operated by animals.

1469
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:52,720
Not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been
brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that.

1470
02:51:52,720 --> 02:52:12,760
And when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always
towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated.

1471
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:16,040
None of the old dreams had been abandoned.

1472
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:25,880
The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields
of England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in.

1473
02:52:25,880 --> 02:52:35,960
Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with
in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming.

1474
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:48,840
Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it
was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud.

1475
02:52:48,840 --> 02:52:58,720
It might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had
been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals.

1476
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:08,440
If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human
beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves.

1477
02:53:08,440 --> 02:53:11,600
No creature among them went upon two legs.

1478
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:14,640
No creature called any other creature "Master."

1479
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:16,720
All animals were equal.

1480
02:53:16,720 --> 02:53:29,120
One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece
of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings.

1481
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:34,240
The sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under
Squealer's supervision.

1482
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:41,240
In the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as
it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were.

1483
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:48,040
It ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which
time the other animals saw nothing of them.

1484
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:51,720
Squealer was with them for the greater part of every day.

1485
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:57,560
He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which
privacy was needed.

1486
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:09,960
It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were
making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.

1487
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:12,920
Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks.

1488
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:14,680
It was Clover's voice.

1489
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:19,760
She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and
rushed into the yard.

1490
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:22,960
Then they saw what Clover had seen.

1491
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:27,960
It was a pig walking on his hind legs.

1492
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:31,560
Yes, it was Squealer.

1493
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:42,320
A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk
in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard.

1494
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:51,960
And a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a
long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs.

1495
02:54:51,960 --> 02:55:04,560
Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would
have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully.

1496
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:21,160
And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon
himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him.

1497
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:23,840
He carried a whip in his trotter.

1498
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:27,680
There was a deadly silence.

1499
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:36,560
Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the
long line of pigs march slowly round the yard.

1500
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:41,080
It was as though the world had turned upside-down.

1501
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:58,880
Then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything-in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit,
developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened-they might have uttered some word of protest.

1502
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:11,520
But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst
out into a tremendous bleating of "Four legs good, two legs better!

1503
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:16,120
Four legs good, two legs better!

1504
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:22,440
Four legs good, two legs better!"

1505
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:25,040
It went on for five minutes without stopping.

1506
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:32,920
And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any
protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.

1507
02:56:32,920 --> 02:56:37,320
Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder.

1508
02:56:37,320 --> 02:56:38,840
He looked round.

1509
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:40,240
It was Clover.

1510
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:43,160
Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever.

1511
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:51,880
Without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round
to the end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written.

1512
02:56:51,880 --> 02:56:57,400
For a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with
its white lettering.

1513
02:56:57,400 --> 02:57:01,920
"My sight is failing," she said finally.

1514
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:06,280
"Even when I was young I could not have read what was written
there.

1515
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:10,520
But it appears to me that that wall looks different.

1516
02:57:10,520 --> 02:57:16,400
Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?"


1517
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:23,840
For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out
to her what was written on the wall.

1518
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:28,400
There was nothing there now except a single Commandment.

1519
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:28,800
It ran:

1520
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:37,680
ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS


1521
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:46,840
After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were
supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.

1522
02:57:46,840 --> 02:57:59,800
It did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging
to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror.

1523
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:24,360
It did not seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth-no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on,
Napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs. Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.

1524
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:30,200
A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up
to the farm.

1525
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:35,080
A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make
a tour of inspection.

1526
02:58:35,080 --> 02:58:41,880
They were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration
for everything they saw, especially the windmill.

1527
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:44,840
The animals were weeding the turnip field.

1528
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:54,960
They worked diligently hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not
knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.

1529
02:58:54,960 --> 02:59:00,480
That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the
farmhouse.

1530
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:06,800
And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals
were stricken with curiosity.

1531
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:15,880
What could be happening in there, now that for the first time
animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality?

1532
02:59:15,880 --> 02:59:21,800
With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into
the farmhouse garden.

1533
02:59:21,800 --> 02:59:28,440
At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover
led the way in.

1534
02:59:28,440 --> 02:59:34,880
They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough
peered in at the dining-room window.

1535
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:47,640
There, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more
eminent pigs, Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table.

1536
02:59:47,640 --> 02:59:51,040
The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs

1537
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:57,480
The company had been enjoying a game of cards but had broken
off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast.

1538
02:59:57,480 --> 03:00:02,600
A large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled
with beer.

1539
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:07,560
No one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed
in at the window.

1540
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:12,960
Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand.


1541
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:17,240
In a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink
a toast.

1542
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:21,960
But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent
upon him to say.

1543
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:34,000
It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said-and, he was sure, to all others
present-to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end.

1544
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:52,560
There had been a time-not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments-but there had been a time when the respected proprietors
of Animal Farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours.

1545
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:57,520
Unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current.


1546
03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:07,520
It had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was
somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood.

1547
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:16,280
Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such
a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail.

1548
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:22,200
They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals,
or even upon their human employees.

1549
03:01:22,200 --> 03:01:25,440
But all such doubts were now dispelled.

1550
03:01:25,440 --> 03:01:33,480
Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and inspected
every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find?

1551
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:41,640
Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an
orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere.

1552
03:01:41,640 --> 03:01:52,720
He believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal
Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county.

1553
03:01:52,720 --> 03:02:00,720
Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features
which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately.

1554
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:11,480
He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings
that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours.

1555
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:19,320
Between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not
be, any clash of interests whatever.

1556
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:22,760
Their struggles and their difficulties were one.

1557
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:26,120
Was not the labour problem the same everywhere?

1558
03:02:26,120 --> 03:02:36,520
Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism
on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it.

1559
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:49,640
After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out:
"If you have your lower animals to contend with," he said, "we have our lower classes!"

1560
03:02:49,640 --> 03:03:03,280
This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low
rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.

1561
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:10,520
And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to
their feet and make certain that their glasses were full.

1562
03:03:10,520 --> 03:03:20,200
"Gentlemen," concluded Mr. Pilkington, "gentlemen, I give you
a toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!"

1563
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:23,360
There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet.

1564
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:31,200
Napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the
table to clink his mug against Mr. Pilkington's before emptying it.

1565
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:38,960
When the cheering had died down, Napoleon, who had remained on
his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say.

1566
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:43,560
Like all of Napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point.


1567
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:48,320
He too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding
was at an end.

1568
03:03:48,320 --> 03:04:00,080
For a long time there had been rumours-circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy-that
there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues.

1569
03:04:00,080 --> 03:04:05,720
They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among
the animals on neighbouring farms.

1570
03:04:05,720 --> 03:04:07,880
Nothing could be further from the truth!

1571
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:15,440
Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and
in normal business relations with their neighbours.

1572
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:21,880
This farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a
co-operative enterprise.

1573
03:04:21,880 --> 03:04:27,400
The title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned
by the pigs jointly.

1574
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:39,360
He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been
made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence stiff further.

1575
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:46,720
Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom
of addressing one another as "Comrade."

1576
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:48,560
This was to be suppressed.

1577
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:59,200
There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching
every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden.

1578
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:03,440
This, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been
buried.

1579
03:05:03,440 --> 03:05:08,520
His visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew
from the masthead.

1580
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:15,640
If so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn
with which it had previously been marked had now been removed.

1581
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:19,080
It would be a plain green flag from now onwards.

1582
03:05:19,080 --> 03:05:25,320
He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington's
excellent and neighbourly speech.

1583
03:05:25,320 --> 03:05:30,280
Mr. Pilkington had referred throughout to "Animal Farm."

1584
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:38,560
He could not of course know-for he, Napoleon, was only now for the
first time announcing it-that the name "Animal Farm" had been abolished.

1585
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:46,840
Henceforward the farm was to be known as "The Manor Farm"-which,
he believed, was its correct and original name.

1586
03:05:46,840 --> 03:05:55,080
"Gentlemen," concluded Napoleon, "I will give you the same toast
as before, but in a different form.

1587
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:57,520
Fill your glasses to the brim.

1588
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:04,600
Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!"


1589
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:10,000
There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were
emptied to the dregs.

1590
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:17,960
But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them
that some strange thing was happening.

1591
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:22,280
What was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs?

1592
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:26,720
Clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another.

1593
03:06:26,720 --> 03:06:31,680
Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three.

1594
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:35,800
But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing?

1595
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:47,080
Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and
continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.

1596
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:51,320
But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short.

1597
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:54,680
An uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse.

1598
03:06:54,680 --> 03:06:57,480
They rushed back and looked through the window again.

1599
03:06:57,480 --> 03:07:00,320
Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress.

1600
03:07:00,320 --> 03:07:05,760
There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious
glances, furious denials.

1601
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:14,680
The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr.
Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.

1602
03:07:14,680 --> 03:07:19,480
Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike.


1603
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:23,720
No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs.


1604
03:07:23,720 --> 03:07:55,749
The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from
pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.
