CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
New York City in fall

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,720
Monday, October 4th. A cool, clear morning 
with the promise of a fine day ahead.  

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,960
Fall is my favorite season in this city - the 
break between summer heat and winter cold.  

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
It's a time when you're not trying to 
escape the worst of New York's weather.  

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,200
In the city parks, leaves on the trees 
were just beginning to turn red and gold.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,600
The name's Nat Marley, licensed private 
investigator. Before I became an investigator,  

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,880
I used to be a police officer - a cop with 
the NYPD, the New York Police Department.  

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,240
Since then, I've worked for myself.  

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,600
So what does "private investigator" make you 
think of? A cool handsome guy with an exciting,  

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,440
sometimes dangerous, job? Think again. Some 
of the time I'm looking for missing persons.  

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
Or maybe I'm watching a husband to 
find out if he's seeing another woman.  

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,680
And when I look in the mirror, I see an ordinary 
guy in his forties who's losing his hair.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
As usual, I caught the number seven subway train  

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,040
from my home in Flushing Main 
Street, Queens, to Midtown Manhattan.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,520
Through Queens, the subway runs above the 
streets. Below you can see different areas,  

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,480
each home to people from around the world - 
Flushing: Chinese and Koreans, Corona Heights:  

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,920
Central and South Americans. At Grand 
Central Station I picked up two coffees.  

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Crowds of New Yorkers were 
hurrying out onto 42nd Street.  

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,080
Then, like any other day, I walked the couple 
of blocks to my office at 220, East 43rd Street.

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,160
My personal assistant, Stella Delgado, 
was already at her desk opening the mail.  

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,040
She's a smart, good-looking Puerto Rican 
who understands everything about computers.  

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,200
She's been with me for most of the time I've been 
a private investigator. Stella comes from Spanish  

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,080
Harlem, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan 
- a part of the city where tourists don't go.  

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,400
On the streets there you'll hear more Spanish 
than English. She never finished school,  

26
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,240
but later, as an adult, went to night school.  

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,840
She's worked hard for what she has now - 
a job, comfortable home and loving family.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
"How are you doing, Stella?" I 
asked. "I got coffee for you.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,360
"Thanks. I'm fine," she replied. 
"Could you leave it on the desk?"

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,080
A knock at the door. Two women entered. 
One, a lady in her middle fifties,  

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,840
dressed in a dark green suit. The suit looked 
expensive, but she looked worried. The other,  

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,440
a young woman in her twenties. I compared their 
faces - they had to be mother and daughter.

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,960
"Do I have the right place?" said the mother. 
"This is the Marley Detective Agency?"

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,160
"That's correct, ma'am. The name's Nat 
Marley. What can I do for you?" I asked.

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
"Well, it's kind of difficult..." she started.

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,840
"Come through to my office and take a 
seat," I said. "Your names, please?"

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,880
"I'm Joyce O'Neill and this is my daughter, 
Julia," said the mother. "It's about my husband,  

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Patrick. He's disappeared and I really need to 
find him. It doesn't matter how much it costs.

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,800
"I'm very sorry to hear that, ma'am," I said. 
"Let's take it slowly, from the beginning."

40
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,760
She looked at me with large sad eyes.  

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,400
"I haven't seen him since Saturday night. When 
I woke up Sunday morning, he was gone. He left  

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,640
this message on the kitchen table." She took 
a postcard from her purse and read to me:
 
 

43
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,560
"My dear Joyce. Don't worry. I'm safe, 
but I can't come home. The thing is,  

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,840
I know something which puts me and maybe you in 
danger. Don't phone me, or my office or the NYPD.  

45
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
If anyone asks for me, say I'm out of town.  

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Trust me. Stay at Julia's place and wait 
for my call. All my love. Patrick."
 
 

47
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
"I have an apartment in Hamilton 
Heights, near Columbia University,"  

48
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,200
Julia explained. "Mom has been 
staying with me there since Sunday."

49
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
"Mr. Marley, I'm worried sick,"  

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,040
Joyce O'Neill continued. "Patrick's 
never done anything like this before."

51
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,800
I knew it could be bad news 
when someone disappears.  

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
But I didn't want to make her any 
more worried than she was already.

53
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,520
"There can be many reasons why someone 
disappears," I said. "Let's not expect the worst.  

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Did your husband call?" She nodded. 
"He's OK, but said he had to hide  

55
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,560
while he decided what to do. He 
wouldn't tell me what was happening.  

56
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,840
He just said the less I knew, the safer I 
would be. I just don't know what to do."

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
"It sounds like he's in immediate danger," I  

58
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,440
said. "It would be useful to know as 
much as possible about your husband."

59
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,760
I learned that Patrick O'Neill 
worked as an accountant.  

60
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,760
His employer was a firm on Wall 
Street called Ocean Star Finance.  

61
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,080
He had worked there for over ten years. His 
home address was Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights.  

62
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,360
His photograph showed a tall, gray-haired guy with 
black metal glasses, but there was nothing special  

63
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:07,360
about him. He had been married for twenty-three 
years. He was just an ordinary family man,  

64
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,320
with a daughter studying for 
her MBA at Columbia University.

65
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,520
"There must be a good reason why your 
husband asked you not to call his office.  

66
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,440
So tell me some more about his work," I said.

67
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,160
"Patrick's the second highest 
person in his department,"  

68
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,120
Joyce O'Neill answered. "The head 
of department is Ronald Steinmann."

69
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
"What kind of guy is this Steinmann?" I asked.

70
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
"He's good at his job - excellent in fact,  

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,200
though he's not well liked. Patrick and 
Steinmann aren't the best of friends."

72
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,240
"A few more questions, if 
you don't mind," I continued.  

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,480
"Has your husband been acting 
strangely or differently in any way?"

74
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:12,160
She thought carefully before answering. "I can't 
say he has. His work's really important to him.  

75
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,440
He often has to work late, and he sometimes 
brings work home - that's normal."

76
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
"I'm afraid I have to ask this. Could 
there be another woman?" I asked her.

77
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,600
She looked at me angrily, then said, 
"Sorry. I guess it's your job to ask.  

78
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,400
My husband has never even 
looked at another woman."

79
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,520
"One final question," I said. "It's useful to 
know how carefully a missing person has planned  

80
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:58,000
to disappear. Has your husband taken anything with 
him? Did he pack clothes? Did he take the car?"

81
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,760
"The car's gone, and he took a travel bag with a 
change of clothes and some books," she replied.

82
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,720
"Thanks, ma'am. You've been really helpful," I 
said. "I'll do everything possible to find out  

83
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,960
what's happened. I'll need to visit you at your 
home later to look at your husband's papers and  

84
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,520
computer. That might give me some ideas. 
Could you meet me there at three o'clock?"

85
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,040
After Mrs O'Neill and her daughter had left, 
I looked out of the window. The sun was trying  

86
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:46,480
to make the gray buildings of East 43rd Street 
look beautiful. It would need to try harder. So  

87
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,920
a normal, hard-working guy had suddenly 
disappeared. He could be in serious trouble.  

88
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,840
I had thought this was going to be 
another ordinary day. My mistake.
 
 

89
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
CHAPTER TWO

90
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,720
Wall Street

91
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
I told Stella what I'd learned so far.  

92
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,920
As I talked, her fingers flew 
over the computer keyboard.

93
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,680
"Take a look, Nat," she said. "The latest 
information from the Ocean Star Finance website."

94
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,960
It was an investment firm on Wall 
Street, the financial center of America.  

95
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,920
"Investment" meant lending out its clients' money 
on international money markets to make more money.  

96
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,560
So their already rich clients became even 
richer. Also, it seemed to be one of the  

97
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:01,840
best firms - a favorite of many famous New 
Yorkers. Year after year Ocean Star had returned  

98
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,280
excellent money to its clients. It 
was like a money-making machine.

99
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,240
The head of the firm was Lorraine Houston. 
She was well known to the public through TV  

100
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,000
talk shows and magazine stories about her 
homes on Long Island and in New England.  

101
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Her clothes only came from the best stores. 
She'd lived the American Dream - the daughter  

102
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,000
of a poor New Jersey family who had 
become the president of Ocean Star.

103
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,960
I decided to call O'Neill's office and spoke 
with his personal assistant. I let her think I  

104
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,720
had some money to invest. Of course, it wasn't the 
truth - I've never had enough money to save much.  

105
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,520
But after fifteen years in the NYPD, 
I'd learned how to tell a good lie.

106
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,120
"This is Mr. Marley," I told her. "I'd like 
to meet with Mr. O'Neill this afternoon.  

107
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
I just wanted to check if he 
could see me at three thirty."

108
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
"I'm sorry," said the personal assistant. "Mr. 
O'Neill called this morning to say he was sick."

109
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,720
"Really? In that case, I'll have to 
speak to the head of department," I said.

110
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
"I'm afraid that's not possible,"  

111
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,160
she replied. "You see, Mr. Steinmann doesn't 
work here anymore. He left the firm on Friday."

112
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,800
"Left the firm?" I asked. 
"Why? Did he find another job?"

113
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,440
"I couldn't say, sir," replied 
the personal assistant.

114
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,520
"Whose decision was this?" I asked.

115
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
"I don't know," she said.

116
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,040
"Do you mean you don't know or you're 
not allowed to tell me?" I asked.

117
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,240
"As I said before, sir, I 
really couldn't say," she said.

118
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,680
Something felt wrong. Both the head 
guys in the department had gone?  

119
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Working at Ocean Star didn't seem too good for 
your health. Was it Steinmann's decision to leave?  

120
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,600
You know what they say when someone suddenly 
leaves a job? "Did he jump or was he pushed?"

121
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
Stella was going through the 
mail. I picked up the phone bill.

122
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,880
"Ouch! That's going to hurt my wallet!" I 
said. "Did we really make that many calls?  

123
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:54,240
Well, we'd better find Patrick O'Neill quickly 
and make ourselves some money. Come on, Stella.  

124
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,840
We're going to visit Wall Street. Let's see if 
we can find out anything more on Ocean Star."

125
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,960
Some investigators take cabs everywhere. Not 
me. If possible, I take public transportation,  

126
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:21,360
the New York subway. It's cheap, fast and much 
safer than it used to be when I was a cop.  

127
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,840
We took a train from Grand Central Station 
to Wall Street. While traveling downtown,  

128
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:37,840
I described a plan to Stella. It was, of 
course, going to mean telling some more lies.

129
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,600
"When we get to Ocean Star, 
we check in with reception  

130
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
and let them think were 
millionaires with money to invest.  

131
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,160
We'll tell them we need financial advice and ask 
to meet with one of their advisors immediately.  

132
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Let's see what they can offer us. We'll 
act all unsure, and ask for promises that  

133
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:11,920
our investment will be completely safe. I'll do 
most of the talking and you watch the advisor."

134
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,280
From the subway station, we walked 
east, past the New York Stock Exchange.  

135
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Outside the building, tourists 
were busy taking pictures.  

136
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,400
Ahead of us we could see the full height of the 
New Century Building. Thirty floors of glass  

137
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:39,840
and metal, a wall of silver in the sunshine. 
Ocean Star Finance used the top four floors.

138
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,160
At the reception desk, you could almost 
smell money in the air. The black office  

139
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,640
furniture looked expensive and 
the carpets were deep and soft.  

140
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,160
A meeting was soon organized. Yes, they 
wanted to talk to the millionaires.  

141
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:09,280
It's true what people say - money does 
open doors. The advisor gave complete  

142
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,000
answers to my questions and seemed to be sure 
of herself. Finally I asked, "So you can promise  

143
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,520
us a return of up to fifteen percent on our 
investment by this time next year? No problem?"

144
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,640
"None at all," she said immediately.  

145
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,080
"You don't need to worry. We offer 
the best service on Wall Street."

146
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,200
Afterwards, I asked Stella for her thoughts.  

147
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,760
"You know, Nat, it was like listening to 
an actor who'd learned her lines well,"  

148
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,080
she said. "She was giving the usual message: 
'Don't worry. What could possibly go wrong?'  

149
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,400
But you know and I know that's not 
always the case in the world of finance."

150
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,760
I told Stella I was going to take 
an early lunch at McFadden's Bar  

151
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
to talk with the people from the Daily News.

152
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:17,760
The information I needed to know about Ocean Star 
couldn't be found on the internet. I wanted the  

153
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,440
inside information. McFadden's, on the 
corner of East 42nd Street and Second Avenue,  

154
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,360
was the second home of Daily News reporters. 
These guys often knew much more than they  

155
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,040
could write about in their newspaper - 
the kind of news that could be dangerous.

156
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,840
Inside the bar, the lunchtime 
crowd was beginning to come in.  

157
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,960
I looked around and saw a tall man with white 
hair among a group of younger reporters.  

158
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,840
He was Ed Winchester, a reporter who had been 
with the Daily News longer than I could remember.  

159
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,080
He had helped me several times in the past.

160
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
"Nat!  

161
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,840
Over here. And while you're at the bar, get me 
another drink," he called, waving an empty glass.

162
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,080
I knew that the price of information from Ed would 
be a beer, but that was cheap enough. I ordered  

163
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,880
two beers and went over to Ed. He had moved to 
an empty table and pushed a chair toward me.

164
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,160
"Well, Nat, what brings you here?" he asked.  

165
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,840
"You got that 'I need to know 
something' look on your face."

166
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,360
I described what had happened during 
the morning and what I already knew.  

167
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:57,040
"It seems kind of strange to me. One of the two 
head guys in the department has suddenly left  

168
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,920
and the other has disappeared on sick leave."

169
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:09,840
Ed thought carefully. "Finance isn't my field, 
but there's a young friend of mine who might be  

170
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,240
able to help." He went over to the reporters 
and returned with a guy in his twenties.  

171
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,840
"Nat, I'd like to introduce Brett Johnson, a 
financial reporter on the Wall Street page.  

172
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,560
Brett, Mr. Marley needs anything you 
might have on Ocean Star Finance."

173
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,320
"OK, Mr. Marley," Brett began. 
"There are two sides to the story.  

174
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
Each year, Ocean Star makes 
excellent money for its clients.  

175
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:51,920
How can they do it? Is it just luck? Or is 
Lorraine Houston really a financial superwoman?

176
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,440
"Second, if Ocean Star can make such good money,  

177
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
then why aren't all the other firms 
on Wall Street doing the same thing?  

178
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,280
However, I don't have all of the facts, 
so that's why you haven't read about it."

179
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,760
"Thanks, Brett. You've given me 
something to think about," I said.
 
 

180
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,640
CHAPTER THREE

181
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Brooklyn Heights

182
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,000
After lunch I met Stella at Grand Central Station 
by the information desk, under the big clock.  

183
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,120
We were going to see Joyce O'Neill at her 
home on Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights.  

184
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,560
As usual, we took the subway.

185
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,640
Henry Street is just one block 
away from the subway station.  

186
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,960
On either side of Henry Street are 
lines of old brownstone houses,  

187
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,840
built in the nineteenth century. We 
walked in the sunshine to the house.

188
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:11,440
The O'Neills opened the door before I could knock. 
Joyce O'Neill looked terrible - she was crying and  

189
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:21,040
her eyes were red. Julia was holding her mother's 
hand. "Please come in," said Mrs. O'Neill.

190
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,840
As she was speaking, the phone rang. She picked 
it up and said, "Joyce O'Neill speaking."  

191
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
Then she slowly put it down.

192
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
"Nobody there. That's the 
third time today," she told me.

193
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:50,480
"I'll check that number if I may?" I asked. I 
called the service to find out who last phoned.  

194
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,840
As I expected, it refused to give me a number. I 
didn't want to make Mrs. O'Neill any more worried.  

195
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,760
"No luck. It wouldn't tell me anything - maybe 
just a wrong number. But if it happens again,  

196
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,600
tell me. Now, this morning I called your 
husband's office at Ocean Star - I let  

197
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,640
them think I was a client. I was told 
he was on sick leave. And another thing.  

198
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,560
Steinmann has left the firm. 
I couldn't find out why."

199
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,880
"Really?" said Mrs. O'Neill. 
"What on earth's going on?"

200
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,960
"I wish I knew," I said. "While were here,  

201
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,960
we'd like to find out more about your husband 
- his interests, what kind of person he is.  

202
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,160
You never know, any little thing could be 
important. Does he have a home office?"

203
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
"Sure, it's through here," said Mrs. O'Neill.

204
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,360
The room looked out onto the street. On either 
side of the window were pictures of old New York.  

205
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,480
Under the window was a desk with nine 
drawers and on the desk sat a computer.  

206
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,840
On the other walls were bookshelves.

207
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,000
"Ms. Delgado will look through 
your husband's computer files,  

208
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
if that's OK with you," I told her.

209
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,840
Stella turned on the computer, but 
of course, we needed the password.

210
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:45,040
Julia spelled it for Stella: "It's J-U-L-I-E. 
That's what my father always calls me."

211
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,800
While Stella continued with the computer, 
I began my search through the books.  

212
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,320
They were of little interest to us. Then 
I continued with the drawers of the desk.  

213
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,720
Again, I discovered nothing that might help 
us until I tried to open the final drawer -  

214
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,080
it was locked. But a minute's work with a 
small knife was enough to open it. It was  

215
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:25,200
full of books about card games, mainly poker. 
I read the titles: Ninety-nine Ways to Win  

216
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:34,080
at Poker, Poker - Use Your Intelligence and 
Win, The Complete Poker Player and so on.

217
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:44,000
O'Neill had read every book carefully. On most 
pages there were notes in pencil - the sort  

218
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,600
of notes that only a serious student of the game 
would make. Was he hiding the books from his wife?  

219
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
I showed them to Mrs. O'Neill.

220
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,960
"Could you tell me if this is your 
husband's handwriting?" I asked.

221
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,440
"Yes, that's Patrick's," she replied.

222
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,600
"Did you realize that your husband was 
interested in card games?" I asked her.

223
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,320
"I had no idea. It's a complete surprise. 
That's something he never talked about.  

224
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,160
And I thought I knew everything 
about him," she said sadly.

225
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,440
Stella opened O'Neill's email and I  

226
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,440
waited patiently as she checked through all 
the information. Finally, she was ready.

227
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,920
"Most of what I've opened here seems to be quite 
normal," said Stella. "Work letters mainly.  

228
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,920
But there's something here - the last email to 
Steinmann, sent on Friday afternoon. It reads,  

229
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,680
'I didn't think you could be so stupid. 
I can't believe what you've done.'"

230
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,480
"Do you have any idea what this could 
be about?" I asked Mrs. O'Neill.

231
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,840
"It could be some kind of 
disagreement," she replied.

232
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Stella needed Mrs. O'Neill's help to 
get into the family bank accounts.  

233
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,840
She entered the numbers and soon the 
information came up on the screen.  

234
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,520
There was a joint account in the 
names of Patrick and Joyce O'Neill,  

235
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,080
and also an account in Joyce O'Neill's name. 
The joint account seemed normal, as did  

236
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,040
Mrs. O'Neill's account. But we needed another 
password to open Patrick O'Neill's account.

237
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Mrs. O'Neill went straight to the kitchen 
and returned with a little notebook.  

238
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
"Patrick said I should keep this in a safe place.  

239
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,320
If anything happened to him, I'd be able 
to find the information on the computer."  

240
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,200
She passed the book to Stella, who searched 
through it to find the necessary numbers.  

241
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,760
New information came on the screen 
and Stella now looked more serious.

242
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,040
"Mrs. O'Neill, do you know someone 
called F. Van Zandt?" she asked.

243
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,440
"I've never heard the name," she answered. "Why?"

244
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,760
"Well, if you look here, there have been 
several large payments to this Van Zandt  

245
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,880
over the last six months," Stella explained.

246
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:45,040
Mrs. O'Neill looked at the screen and put her hand 
to her mouth. "I just don't understand," she said.  

247
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:54,400
"This last payment is $15,000! And look 
here. Patrick took out $10,000 this morning."

248
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,840
"There's more," said Stella. "Two large payments 
to Steinmann during the past three months.  

249
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,120
Over $25,000."

250
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,360
"I really can't understand it," said Mrs. O'Neill.

251
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,040
"There must be a good reason," I 
said. "Van Zandt's an unusual name,  

252
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,240
so I hope it won't be too much 
trouble to find him - or her."

253
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:33,440
I had a good idea what was going on. O'Neill 
could be a secret poker player. Those payments  

254
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,440
could mean that he'd lost heavily at poker 
and was paying back the winner month by month.  

255
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
But why had he paid all that money to Steinmann?
 
 

256
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,840
CHAPTER FOUR

257
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,160
A voice from the past

258
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,200
Tuesday, October 5th. Stella and 
I were at East 43rd Street early.  

259
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,800
Now we had another person to find.

260
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,640
"Stella, see if you can find a 
phone number for this Van Zandt,"  

261
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
I asked. "I'll look for a number for Steinmann."

262
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:24,640
My search was much faster than Stella's. It 
was all there in the phone book - the number  

263
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,400
and an address on West 75 th Street, on 
the Upper West Side near Central Park.  

264
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
You needed serious money to 
live in that part of town.

265
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,720
I made the call. "Good morning. May 
I speak with Mr. Steinmann?" I asked.

266
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,920
"Who are you and what's your business with Mr. 
Steinmann?" answered a loud voice. A voice I  

267
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:58,000
knew very well - Captain Oldenberg of the 
NYPD. What was he doing there? I wondered.

268
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,640
"Oldenberg! Great to hear your voice 
again!" I said. "Remember me? Nat Marley.  

269
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Why, it only seems like yesterday 
when we used to be cops together."

270
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:22,080
Oldenberg didn't want to talk about old times. 
"Just answer the question, Marley!" he shouted.

271
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,800
"OK, OK. I'm making the call for a client.  

272
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,960
Mr. Steinmann is the head of her husband's 
department. It's important that I speak with him."

273
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,120
"Very interesting," replied Oldenberg. "That's 
going to be kind of difficult. You see,  

274
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,840
Steinmann has disappeared. Nobody's seen him since 
Friday. How about you tell me what's going on?"

275
00:30:51,440 --> 00:31:00,560
I knew I might need Oldenberg's help. I told 
myself to be patient. "My client's husband is  

276
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,480
in some kind of trouble," I said. "I thought 
his boss could help with a few questions."

277
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,720
"I get the picture," said Oldenberg. "As 
usual, you can't tell me the full story.  

278
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,560
But let me tell you this, Marley. Don't try hiding 
information that could help my investigation,  

279
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,640
or else I'll have you at Police 
Headquarters for questioning."

280
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:38,000
Message received and understood. Oldenberg was 
a good cop and was doing his job. But, as I knew  

281
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,840
from the old days with the NYPD, he was neither 
the friendliest nor the easiest guy to work with.

282
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:55,200
As soon as I put the phone down, it rang. It 
was Mrs. O'Neill. She had returned home to  

283
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Henry Street to pick up a change of clothes 
and she had found the front door wide open.  

284
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,760
Someone had broken into the house. I 
remembered the calls that Mrs. O'Neill  

285
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,720
had received yesterday. Now I knew that someone 
was checking to see when the house was empty.

286
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
"Is anything missing?" I asked.

287
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:26,000
"I really don't know. Please come quickly. 
I'm so afraid they'll come back," she said.

288
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:34,400
"Don't touch anything," I told her. "Can you 
wait with a neighbor?... Good. I'm on my way."

289
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,280
I left Stella looking for phone numbers for 
Van Zandts. I took another subway ride to  

290
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,840
Brooklyn Heights. With the number of traffic 
lights between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn,  

291
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,760
the subway was always faster. I called Mrs. 
O'Neill's cellphone five minutes before I arrived.  

292
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
She was standing by the front 
door, her hands shaking.

293
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,800
"Mr. Marley, this is just horrible. It must be 
something to do with my poor Patrick," she cried.

294
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,560
She led me into the house. Someone had 
made a complete mess of the home office.  

295
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,160
All the books were off the shelves, with their 
pages open. Empty desk drawers were lying on  

296
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:33,120
the carpet. The computer was still there, but 
when I felt around the back of the machine,  

297
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,840
it was open. The hard drive was missing.

298
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:45,200
"Look here," I said. "That's what they were 
looking for - information on the hard drive.  

299
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,360
But if they don't find what they're looking 
for on the hard drive they could return  

300
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,040
and you'll be in serious danger. So I don't 
want you to return to this house again."

301
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,720
"I'll stay at Julia's until this 
is over," Mrs O'Neill said sadly.

302
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,440
"OK. We have to make sure this house is 
safe before you leave," I said. "I'll call a  

303
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,840
twenty-four hour lock service. You'll need new, 
stronger locks. I'll stay here while we wait."

304
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,480
I would probably have a couple of 
hours to wait with Mrs. O'Neill.  

305
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,520
It was a chance to ask a few more questions and 
get a better picture of her husband. I didn't  

306
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,560
think she realized how much danger she could 
be in. When would she agree to call the NYPD?

307
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
"Mrs. O'Neill, what can you tell 
me about your husband's boss,  

308
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Steinmann?" I started. "Yesterday you 
said they weren't the best of friends."

309
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,120
"A couple of years ago, Patrick had the 
chance to become the department head.  

310
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,200
He was the right person for the job and he was 
well liked. Unfortunately, he didn't get the job,  

311
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,560
though that wasn't his fault. Lorraine Houston, 
the president, wanted someone fresh and new  

312
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,120
from outside. She preferred the kind of 
guy who didn't care if he wasn't liked. So  

313
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Steinmann got the job. Patrick continued 
with his work as best as he could,  

314
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,080
but there was no friendship 
between him and Steinmann."

315
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,880
"Thanks. That's useful to know. Has your 
husband always lived in Brooklyn?" I went on.

316
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,760
"No. We moved here when Julia was just a 
kid. Patrick's family are Irish-American.  

317
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,680
His grandparents arrived in the U.S. from Dublin 
in the 1920s. They more or less got off the ship  

318
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,160
and moved straight to the East Village. Patrick 
grew up in Alphabet City, on 10th Street."

319
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,320
Alphabet City is the part of the East Village 
which gets its name from Avenues A, B, C and D,  

320
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,240
which cut across it. It didn't use to be a 
safe area. In fact, it was a center for drugs  

321
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:25,920
and crime. But now things have changed. Today you 
can find cool cafes, bars and stores in the area.

322
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,040
"So he didn't come from a rich family?" I asked.

323
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,840
"Not at all. Patrick's parents had a hard 
life. They never lived the American Dream.  

324
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,600
It wasn't easy for Patrick, either. 
He's the youngest of six children,  

325
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,160
so there was no question of the family paying 
for college. Patrick did it the hard way and  

326
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,200
paid for everything by working nights at a 24/7 
store. He never had the advantages that I had."

327
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,400
"Where do you think he might 
hide to escape from somebody?"  

328
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,160
I asked. "Where would he 
feel safest in this city?"  

329
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:12,240
"I couldn't say for sure. But the area he knows 
best of all is the East Village," she replied.

330
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,040
"Right. Now, Mrs. O'Neill, I don't want to worry 
you more than necessary, but I think you're in  

331
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,800
real danger. The people that broke into your house 
could come back. I think we should call the NYPD."

332
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,960
Mrs. O'Neill got up from her armchair, walked 
over to the window and looked out into the street.

333
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,360
At last she spoke: "Mr. Marley, I 
know you're offering the best advice.  

334
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,240
But you remember what Patrick said in 
his message: 'Don't call the NYPD.'  

335
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,200
Those are his wishes, and 
I have to follow them."
 
 

336
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,080
CHAPTER FIVE

337
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,800
Death by the Hudson River

338
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,560
It was midday before I got 
back to East 43rd Street.  

339
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,920
I picked up a snack at Grand Central Station 
before returning to the office. It hadn't taken  

340
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,280
Stella long to find phone numbers for Van Zandts. 
There were over fifty in all of New York City.

341
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,600
"OK, Stella. We can share this job," I said. 
"I'll take the first phone book and you can  

342
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,280
start on the second. Say you're an old friend of 
O'Neill's and that you're trying to find him."

343
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:51,280
It was slow and boring work, but I felt it would 
be worth it in the end. "Good afternoon. Is this  

344
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,040
Mr. Van Zandt? If I could have a minute of 
your time?... You see, I'm trying to find  

345
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,800
an old friend of mine, Patrick O'Neill... Would 
you know him?... No? OK. Thanks for your time."

346
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,400
As the calls continued, I 
wasn't feeling too hopeful.  

347
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,600
Then I got an answering machine. 
I listened to the message:  

348
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,760
"I'm sorry I can't get to the phone right 
now. Leave a message or phone 212-555-01230."

349
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,640
I called the number. The phone was 
answered after a couple of rings.  

350
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,280
First the sound of jazz music, then 
a voice: "Frankie's Cocktail Lounge."

351
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,840
"Good afternoon. Is that Mr. Van Zandt?" I asked.

352
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,120
"Hold on..." I heard the guy shout 
above the noise, "Frank! Call for you."

353
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Could this finally be the right 
Van Zandt? I waited patiently.

354
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,640
"Frank Van Zandt speaking."

355
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,920
"If I could have a moment of your time, Mr. 
Van Zandt," I began. "I've lost the phone  

356
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,920
number and address of an old friend, Patrick 
O'Neill. Would you know how I could find him?"

357
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,560
"Oh yeah? I might. Who's 
asking?" replied Van Zandt.

358
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,480
Not very welcoming, I thought. 
Time to tell another lie.

359
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,920
"The name's Marley. I'm an old college friend. 
Patrick and I were at accounting school together."

360
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,560
"If you're so clever, mister, 
look in the phone book.  

361
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,800
And don't call again," he 
added, then put the phone down.

362
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:50,080
The line went dead - clearly this guy didn't 
like me asking after O'Neill. This time I felt  

363
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:58,160
I was in luck. Perhaps I should visit Frankie's 
Cocktail Lounge. Before I could organize anything,  

364
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,720
the phone rang. I picked it up and heard that 
voice from the past again - Captain Oldenberg.

365
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,840
"Marley!" he shouted. "Your 
line's been busy for ages.  

366
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,160
Could I have a minute of your valuable time?"

367
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,920
"Sure. Go ahead." I replied, 
holding the phone away from my ear.

368
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,040
"Get yourself to the 79th Street Boat Basin. 
I got something to show you." He laughed.

369
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,400
When Oldenberg laughs, it usually means bad news.

370
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,600
"OK. But why? What's going on?" I asked.

371
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,520
"It's a surprise. But I want you 
here now," Oldenberg ordered.

372
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
I told Stella what was happening.  

373
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,600
She gave me a smile and said, "Don't get mad 
at Oldenberg. Remember, we may need his help."

374
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,560
I was back on the subway again, this time to 
West 79th Street. I walked the two blocks from  

375
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,640
the subway station west toward the Hudson River, 
and crossed the Riverside Park to the boat basin.  

376
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,680
From here you could see across the river to 
New Jersey. The temperature had dropped and  

377
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,760
the sky was full of heavy gray clouds. A 
cold wind started to blow from the west.

378
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:27,200
All around the boat basin were houseboats. I've 
heard it's the cheapest way to live in this city.  

379
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,720
Ahead I could see NYPD cars in 
a parking lot near the river.  

380
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,600
As I got closer, an NYPD cop stopped me 
and said, "Sorry, sir. You can't enter.

381
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,280
"The name's Marley. Captain 
Oldenberg's expecting me," I replied.

382
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,560
"OK. Come with me and we'll 
find the captain," said the cop.

383
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,800
Oldenberg was standing in the parking lot 
behind a Chevrolet Impala. He was smiling,  

384
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,200
which always made me feel uncomfortable.

385
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
"Take a look at this," said 
Oldenberg, waving at the car.

386
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,200
Oldenberg moved to the back of the car and 
opened the trunk. Inside was a dead man.

387
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,280
Oldenberg called to the police doctor.  

388
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,280
"Could you show me his face again, Doc?" he 
asked. "OK, Marley, time for your surprise!

389
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,840
The NYPD doctor was wearing a suit of white 
material over her clothes, and white plastic  

390
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:42,320
gloves and shoes. She carefully took the dead 
man's head in her hands and moved it round so  

391
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:50,240
we could see the face. His skin was gray and 
his mouth was open. Between his eyes was a hole.

392
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:59,280
"Marley, meet Ronald Steinmann. Doc, would you 
tell Mr. Marley what you know?" said Oldenberg.

393
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,000
"I'd say he's been dead about two or three 
days. A single shot to the head. You see  

394
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,640
these cuts around his face? This guy was 
hit hard a number of times before he died.  

395
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,280
Can't tell you much more just 
now," the police doctor told me.

396
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,480
Heavy rain began to fall. I was feeling sick.  

397
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,040
Although I've seen dead bodies before, 
I still get that same horrible feeling.

398
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,560
"I just checked the license plate.  

399
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:37,760
This car belongs to Mr. Patrick O'Neill, Henry 
Street, Brooklyn. We need to talk, Marley,"  

400
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,480
said Oldenberg. "And I guess you need 
a drink. Let's go somewhere warmer."

401
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,760
Oldenberg took me to the Boat Basin Cafe, 
where he ordered me a double Scotch.  

402
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,040
The drink was just the right medicine.

403
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,400
"Marley, I got an idea and I think I may be 
right. Your client could be Patrick O'Neill,  

404
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,560
an accountant with Ocean Star Finance? 
Or one of his family?" he asked.

405
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,240
I nodded. The safest thing was to 
listen and see what Oldenberg wanted.

406
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,320
"Steinmann disappeared some time on Friday 
afternoon. I've been asking questions at  

407
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:32,240
Ocean Star. On Friday morning, people heard 
Steinmann and O'Neill arguing. This was no  

408
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:39,440
conversation between friends. People said it 
was more like a fight. It was behind closed  

409
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:47,680
doors so they couldn't say what they were arguing 
about. Today Steinmann is found in O'Neill's car,  

410
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:56,880
murdered. At the same time nobody seems to know 
where O'Neill is. You see where this is leading?"

411
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,960
I understood very well. The sick feeling 
in my stomach started to get stronger.

412
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,160
"I'm talking murder, Marley. I want to 
question Patrick O'Neill about the murder  

413
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:20,640
of Ronald Steinmann. I want to know why O'Neill 
was paying money into Steinmann's account. Also,  

414
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,080
the reason why O'Neill had sent him an angry 
email. It began, 'I didn't think you could be so  

415
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:36,080
stupid.' That means I have to find him and 
I believe you know where he is. You used to  

416
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:44,160
be a cop, Marley, so you know the way the police 
work. If you refuse to tell me, that's a crime."

417
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,360
I held my head in my hands. I could 
only tell Oldenberg the truth.  

418
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,640
That wouldn't be what he wanted to hear.

419
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,840
"Believe me, Oldenberg, I'm being completely 
straight with you. I have no idea where  

420
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:10,320
O'Neill is. Yes, my client is his wife. All she 
knows is that her husband is hiding somewhere."

421
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,680
"OK. Another thing, Marley. I have to 
question Mrs. O'Neill, but I can't find her.  

422
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:27,280
I just get the answering machine every time 
I call. I need your help," said Oldenberg.

423
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,200
"OK, Oldenberg. I'll see 
what I can do," I replied.

424
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,560
On the journey back to East 43rd Street, I 
thought about the information I already knew.  

425
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,160
I took a fresh page in my notebook and 
wrote down the facts I knew for sure  

426
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,880
and the questions that needed answers.

427
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:57,600
I knew O'Neill had disappeared sometime between 
Saturday night and Sunday morning. He didn't like  

428
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:05,760
his boss, Steinmann, and on Friday he'd argued 
with him. Also, he had sent an angry email to  

429
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:13,280
Steinmann. O'Neill had made large payments to 
Steinmann and Van Zandt. He was interested in  

430
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,840
poker. Someone had broken into his house 
and stolen the hard drive of his computer.  

431
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,760
Now the police had found Steinmann 
dead in the trunk of O'Neill's car.

432
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:36,240
What was I less sure about? What did O'Neill 
know which put him in danger? Had Steinmann  

433
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:46,080
known the same thing? Had O'Neill lost heavily 
at poker? Was Ocean Star in difficulties? What  

434
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:54,400
could explain those payments to Steinmann and Van 
Zandt? And finally, could a guy like O'Neill kill?  

435
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,840
The more I thought about it, Ocean Star 
had to be the key to all the questions.

436
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,720
I called Mrs. O'Neill at her daughter's apartment.  

437
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,960
"You said that your husband took his 
car when he disappeared," I said.

438
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,920
"That's right. It's not parked 
in the street," she replied.

439
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:25,360
"I'm afraid I have some terrible 
news. This morning, Steinmann's body  

440
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,840
was found in the trunk of your husband's car.

441
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,200
I heard a scream over the phone, then nothing.

442
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,120
"Are you still there?" I asked.

443
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:48,320
"Yes," she replied quietly. "This is just 
awful. I can't believe it. So what happens now?"

444
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,120
"The police are now looking for your 
husband," I explained. "I'm sorry,  

445
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,840
but you'll have to talk to the police."

446
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,240
"I realize I don't have any 
choice," replied Mrs. O'Neill.  

447
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,840
"But there's one condition. The meeting should 
be at your office on East 43rd Street."
 
 

448
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,760
CHAPTER SIX

449
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,840
Questions and answers

450
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,720
Wednesday, October 6th. Captain Oldenberg and 
Mrs. O'Neill were in my office at nine o'clock.  

451
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,760
Mrs. O'Neill was wearing a very fashionable 
black jacket and skirt with a white blouse.  

452
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,360
Maybe she did her shopping on Fifth Avenue. 
Oldenberg was dressed in an ugly brown suit  

453
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,360
with an orange tie - clothes that had been 
in fashion sometime during the last century.

454
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,920
Before Oldenberg started questioning Mrs. O'Neill, 
I told him what I knew about Patrick O'Neill.  

455
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,600
I was trying to show the captain that O'Neill 
was just a good ordinary guy, not a murderer.

456
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,960
"As I see it, Patrick O'Neill could be in 
the middle of something very dangerous,"  

457
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:21,680
I began. "So far, we have no clear idea of 
what that might be. We can't be sure if the  

458
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:29,600
key to this case is Ocean Star or something that 
happened between O'Neill and Steinmann - or both.

459
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,880
"Let's move on to O'Neill, the person. We have 
a happily- married family man who's worked for  

460
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:46,400
the same employer for over ten years. In that 
time he's risen to be second in his department.  

461
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:53,520
He's given years of his life to the 
firm. Also, he has no criminal history."

462
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,040
Oldenberg started to question Mrs. O'Neill.  

463
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,280
As I thought, his main interest was the 
argument between O'Neill and Steinmann.

464
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,880
"Mrs. O'Neill," said Oldenberg, "I was 
told at Ocean Star that your husband and  

465
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,440
Steinmann argued on Friday before they both 
disappeared. We don't know what it was about,  

466
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,760
but people heard Mr. O'Neill shouting. 
Would you say they worked well together?"

467
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:33,440
"It was never easy for Patrick," she 
replied. "Steinmann pushed people hard.  

468
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,640
Second best was never good enough for him.  

469
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,480
I can't say Patrick liked him, but 
he did his work as well as he could."

470
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,760
"Two years ago, your husband had the 
chance to become the department head.  

471
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,680
But Lorraine Houston brought in Steinmann. How did 
your husband feel about this?" asked Oldenberg.

472
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
"At the time he was angry, but he 
learned to accept what had happened.  

473
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,880
Life has to go on," Mrs. O'Neill replied.

474
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,240
"Could you think of anybody who would want 
to kill Steinmann?" Oldenberg asked her.

475
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,960
"No," she replied. "OK, so he's not the nicest 
of guys, but that's no reason for murder."

476
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:27,840
"Your husband was paying money to Steinmann. 
Do you have any idea why?" Oldenberg went on.

477
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,040
"None at all," Mrs. O'Neill replied.

478
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:39,440
Oldenberg continued with questions about the angry 
email, which Mrs. O'Neill answered patiently.  

479
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:47,440
At last, he said, "One more thing, Mrs. O'Neill. 
Would you agree to a search of your house?"

480
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,840
"I guess I have to," she replied, and 
handed him her keys. "Go ahead and do it."

481
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,680
"Thanks," he said. "If I'm going 
to get any further with this case,  

482
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,640
I must find him. Will you call him?"

483
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,800
Mrs. O'Neill looked him straight in 
the eyes and said, "That's impossible.  

484
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,760
Patrick only calls me from pay phones."

485
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:24,080
"Patrick O'Neill is wanted for murder," Oldenberg 
said. "And if you, Marley, or you, Mrs. O'Neill,  

486
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:31,600
know where he is, and refuse to tell me, that's 
a crime. You could both find yourselves in jail."

487
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:40,320
Mrs. O'Neill looked angrily at Oldenberg. 
If looks could kill, he would be a dead man.

488
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,560
After Oldenberg had left the 
building, Mrs. O'Neill started to cry.

489
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,600
"I'm sure Patrick has nothing to do with 
Steinmann's murder," she said. "But what if the  

490
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:59,760
police don't believe me? And what if the people 
who killed Steinmann go after Patrick next?"

491
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:08,160
"I will find him, I promise you," I said. 
"But you must be careful. When you get  

492
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:15,680
back to Julia's apartment, stay inside, OK? 
Stella, could you call a cab for Mrs. O'Neill?"

493
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:24,160
When Mrs. O'Neill had left, I organized some help 
from an old friend who used to be a policeman like  

494
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:33,440
myself. A guy who was as useful as ten NYPD 
officers - Joe Blaney. He'd taught me more  

495
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,800
about staying alive on the streets of Manhattan 
than you could ever learn at Police Academy.  

496
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,280
He's the sort of person you needed 
if there was going to be trouble  

497
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,000
and he knew how to use a gun. I last 
carried a gun when I was a New York cop.  

498
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:58,880
I haven't carried one since and haven't wanted 
to - but there are times when one is necessary.

499
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,040
I picked up the phone. "Joe,  

500
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:11,200
I have work for you. It could be dangerous, 
so bring a gun. A missing person's in danger,  

501
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:18,800
and we're going to find him. Come to East 43rd 
Street with your car, as soon as you can."
 
 

502
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,240
CHAPTER SEVEN

503
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,000
Frankies Cocktail Lounge

504
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:35,920
The plan was that Joe and I would pay a visit to 
Van Zandt and see if he could lead us to O'Neill.  

505
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:43,840
Meanwhile, Mrs. O'Neill would come back to the 
office that afternoon and stay with Stella.

506
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:51,040
Joe Blaney arrived in his car soon after 
midday. He's in his middle-sixties,  

507
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,520
but he's tall and slim with a full head of 
white hair. Although he's probably twenty  

508
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,520
years older than me, I'd say he looks 
younger. Some guys have all the luck.

509
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,160
In the car, Joe pulled his jacket to one side 
to show me the gun. "Let's hope we don't have  

510
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:20,880
to use this, boss," he said. We drove downtown 
on Second Avenue toward 4th Street. The traffic  

511
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,120
wasn't too heavy and we soon arrived in the 
East Village. We went straight along 4th  

512
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:34,240
Street to Avenue A. Frankie's Cocktail Lounge 
was on 5th Street, between Avenues A and B.

513
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,200
Joe stopped the car. Above the 
double doors, I could read the words:  

514
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,880
"Frankie's - Cold Drinks, 
Warm People, Hot Sounds".

515
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,560
"Let's do it," I said.

516
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:59,440
We went into Frankie's and sat at a table. 
At first, it seemed almost dark, but soon I  

517
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:07,520
could see better. It was a comfortable room with 
armchairs, sofas, red carpets and the sound of  

518
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:16,000
jazz guitar music. We needed clear heads so we 
ordered two coffees, not the Cocktail Specials.  

519
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,080
There were no customers at the bar, so 
I had a look at who was working behind  

520
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:27,760
it. A couple of bartenders and someone 
who I guessed must be the boss.  

521
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:36,160
He was medium height with a short black 
beard, but without a single hair on his head.

522
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,520
"I think we've found Van Zandt," I said,  

523
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,520
looking toward the bar. "We'll 
try and have a little talk."

524
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,360
I walked over to the bar with Joe. Van Zandt 
looked up from some papers he was checking.

525
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,760
"Would you be Mr. Van Zandt?" I asked.

526
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,160
"That's me," he replied. "What can I do for you?"

527
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,360
"Could I talk to you about 
Patrick O'Neill?" I asked.

528
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,640
"Who are you?" Van Zandt asked 
carefully and gave me a cold, hard look.

529
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:21,200
"Nat Marley, licensed private investigator," I 
said. "I spoke to you on the phone yesterday.  

530
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:28,720
I believe you know O'Neill. His wife's very 
worried about him and I think you could help."

531
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,920
"I don't have to talk to you!" he said angrily.

532
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,880
Suddenly a big strong bartender 
was standing in front of me.

533
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,120
"You got a problem, boss?" he asked Van Zandt.

534
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,640
"It's OK," I said quietly. "We're 
not looking for trouble. Look,  

535
00:59:51,360 --> 01:00:00,080
take my cellphone and press 'Call'. You'll get 
my office. Ask to talk with O'Neill's wife."

536
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,840
Van Zandt did as I said and spent a couple 
of minutes checking facts with Mrs. O'Neill.  

537
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,840
After a while he returned the cellphone and said,  

538
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,760
"OK. What do you want?" He waved the bartender 
away and led us to a room behind the bar.  

539
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:27,200
Inside, the air didn't smell too fresh - old 
cigarette smoke. Van Zandt found chairs and  

540
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:33,440
sat us at a round table. I introduced 
Joe, then began questioning Van Zandt.

541
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,920
"I believe that O'Neill has 
paid you a lot of money?"  

542
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,840
I asked. "You're not stealing from him, I hope."

543
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:49,760
"It's not robbery," replied Van Zandt. 
"That's what I won fairly in a poker game.  

544
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:57,600
It works both ways. Patrick's an excellent 
player and I've paid him thousands when I lost.  

545
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:05,040
We're old friends. I've known him since we were 
both kids, working nights at a 24/7 store."

546
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,000
"So explain this," I continued. 
"Why does a Wall Street accountant  

547
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,280
come to a back room in the 
East Village to play poker?"

548
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,160
"I've met several guys like Patrick - 
hard-working family men who earn good money.  

549
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,760
But they want a little more from life. Maybe 
they're just bored so I give them a good time.  

550
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:38,480
I know organizing back-room poker games is 
a crime, but I'm not hurting anybody. These  

551
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:45,920
guys have the money - like Patrick's boss, 
Steinmann. I'm just offering them a service."

552
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,840
"So O'Neill brought Steinmann here?" 
I asked Van Zandt in surprise.

553
01:01:53,360 --> 01:02:02,400
"Yeah. Once or twice. I don't think Patrick really 
wanted to, but I guess he couldn't refuse. One  

554
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,200
night we all lost heavily to Steinmann. He 
played like poker was his second profession.  

555
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,840
I had to ask Patrick not to bring him again. 
It would hurt my bank account too much."

556
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:25,440
Van Zandt had answered two questions - why O'Neill 
had made payments to both himself and Steinmann.

557
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,000
"OK. Let's forget the money," I said.  

558
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:36,240
"I'm really interested in finding O'Neill. 
You know he's in some kind of trouble?"

559
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,680
"After reading about Steinmann's 
murder in the morning papers,  

560
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,320
I had a good idea what the trouble could 
be," replied Van Zandt. "Patrick got here  

561
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:54,560
soon after midnight, Sunday morning. He said he 
was in danger, but he wouldn't talk about it.  

562
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,880
He needed to hide someplace for a few days and 
was going to check into a hotel around here.  

563
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:10,560
He also told me to keep quiet if anyone came 
asking questions. And one last thing - he told me  

564
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:17,440
to expect a letter from his firm. He said it was 
really important and I should keep it for him."

565
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,320
"If it's arrived, could we take a look?" I asked.

566
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,400
"I guess I could show you," he said.

567
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,960
It was a thick envelope with the address 
written in O'Neill's handwriting.  

568
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,600
I took out my pocket knife and cut it open. 
Inside, I found some papers - probably about  

569
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:48,320
twenty pages. At the top of each page I 
could see the words "Ocean Star Finance"  

570
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:54,000
in red and gold letters. On every 
page, there were lines of numbers.

571
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,440
"You know what this is?" asked Van Zandt.

572
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,560
"I guess some sort of accounts from Ocean Star,"  

573
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:11,840
I said. "Another guess - this information may 
have something to do with Steinmann's murder.  

574
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:19,680
Mr. Van Zandt, I'd like to thank you for your 
help. We may be able to reach O'Neill in time.  

575
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,560
I don't think anyone else knows these papers are 
here, so could you keep them in a safe place?"

576
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,480
Before Joe and I started searching the East 
Village, I called Stella to tell her what we'd  

577
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:41,440
discovered so far. When I'd finished, Stella 
said, "Mrs. O'Neill wants to speak with you."

578
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,920
"Mr. Marley, thank you," said Mrs. O'Neill. 
"You're getting close to Patrick, I can feel it.  

579
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,600
Please find him and make the police 
believe that my husband is no killer."
 
 

580
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,400
CHAPTER EIGHT

581
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,000
The East Village

582
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,560
Our search area was wide - everything between 
Fourth Avenue and Avenue D, then everything  

583
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:21,280
between East Houston Street and East 14th Street. 
Within that area are fourteen streets and eight  

584
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:30,320
avenues. Now do the math - that makes around 
eighty blocks. The good news was that if O'Neill  

585
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:36,800
was staying in a hotel in the area, like Van Zandt 
said, we didn't have too many places to check.  

586
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,480
Most of the hotels are either along 
Third Avenue or the streets off it.

587
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,640
There were two problems. First, what 
sort of hotel would O'Neill choose?  

588
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,360
Somewhere busy, on a crowded street 
where he wouldn't be noticed?  

589
01:05:54,320 --> 01:06:00,480
Or would he prefer somewhere quieter and more 
basic, with less activity? A place where it would  

590
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:08,080
be easier to watch and listen. Second, how would 
we find out if he was staying there? Would he  

591
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:14,400
check in under his own name and how could we get 
the hotel receptionist to tell us if he was there?  

592
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:21,040
Hotel receptionists don't give information 
about their guests to complete strangers.

593
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,240
So we had a plan - I'd say I had 
a business meeting with O'Neill.  

594
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:33,600
To help receptionists believe the story, I'd asked 
Stella to produce some company information for  

595
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,880
"Patrick O'Neill Accounting". There 
was a photo of O'Neill on the front,  

596
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,920
which I'd hold so the 
receptionist could see his face.

597
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:50,640
Time after time at hotels I introduced myself 
and spoke to the receptionists. "Excuse me,  

598
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,080
my name's Marley. I have a 
meeting with Patrick O'Neill.  

599
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,800
Would you call his room to 
tell him 'I'm at reception?"

600
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,800
We had no luck at the more expensive places, 
which were full of tourists and business people.  

601
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,080
After asking at a few, we knew 
what sort of answers to expect:  

602
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,880
"I'm sorry, sir. Do you have the correct 
hotel?... I wish I could help you, but..."

603
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:25,520
Hour after hour, our search area grew 
wider. We had moved away from Third Avenue,  

604
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:30,000
deeper into the center of the East 
Village, toward Alphabet City.

605
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,840
At some of the cheaper places, the receptionists 
were less patient: "We got nobody by that name  

606
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:44,800
staying here, mister... Look, mister, I just 
work here. It's not my job to remember faces."

607
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:54,400
We continued until early evening. It was six 
thirty, not long before sunset, and the sky in the  

608
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:03,840
west was growing pink. We just had one or two more 
places to check in Alphabet City. The next hotel,  

609
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:11,120
the Madigan Inn on Avenue B, looked like an ugly, 
dirty place, but the receptionist was helpful.

610
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,040
I asked the usual questions and made 
sure that she could see O'Neill's photo.  

611
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:25,680
Then the surprise - I could see from the look 
on her face that she knew something. "Sure I  

612
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:32,080
know the guy," she said. "But not by the name of 
O'Neill. I don't know if I'm allowed to say..."

613
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:40,240
I showed her my investigator's license and said, 
"The truth is, this guy's life is in danger.  

614
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45,760
I'm working for his family and we need to 
find him quickly, before someone else does."

615
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:54,000
She believed me and turned to check the 
computer. "Yeah, there he is," she said.  

616
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:00,320
"He stayed for one night and checked out 
yesterday. The name he gave was Brendan Touhey."

617
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,160
"Can you tell me anything more?" I asked. "Did 
he have any visitors? How did he spend his time?"

618
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:16,000
"Well, he asked for a room on the street. 
That seemed to be important. He didn't have  

619
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,440
any visitors and spent most of the time in 
his room. I think he was watching the street.  

620
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,200
Or that's what I thought when 
I looked up at his window."

621
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,840
"Thanks," I said. "You've been really helpful."

622
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,720
"You could ask at our other hotel," she said. 
"I could phone ahead to tell them to expect you.  

623
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,440
It's the Metro, on Avenue C between 4th and 3rd."

624
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,120
"Please. If you would," I replied.

625
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,760
As we left, I said to Joe, "At 
last we're getting somewhere.  

626
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:58,800
I think I know what he's doing. Just staying 
a night at one place, then moving on."

627
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,520
Joe suddenly stopped in front 
of the door to the street.  

628
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,280
"Nat, you see that car just across the street?"

629
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,480
"The black one?" I asked.

630
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,720
"That's it. I think I've seen 
it before. Outside your office,  

631
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,600
but I couldn't be too sure," Joe went on.

632
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:28,320
I studied the car carefully. A Lexus, which costs 
serious money. Three guys with dark glasses were  

633
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:35,600
inside. It was starting to get dark and I've 
never liked guys who wear sunglasses at night.  

634
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,320
I had a horrible feeling that 
those people meant trouble.

635
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,720
Then the driver looked toward us and 
the car quickly moved along the avenue.  

636
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,560
In the poor light, I couldn't 
read the license plate.

637
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,920
"What do you think, boss?" asked 
Joe. "Are they following us:

638
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,760
The streetlights had now come 
on. Under their yellow light  

639
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:08,640
I could see the answer to Joe's question. 
On the road beside Joe's car was a knife.  

640
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,720
There was no air in two of the 
tires so it was impossible to drive.

641
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Now I realized what was happening. Those guys had 
followed us, hoping we would lead them to O'Neill.  

642
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,280
They knew we were checking hotels, and the Metro  

643
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,320
was the last one in the area. They 
wanted to make sure they got there first.

644
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:42,960
We ran across to Avenue C, but we 
were losing valuable time. The Metro,  

645
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,480
like the last hotel, looked 
as if nobody cared for it.  

646
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,440
The receptionist, though, was 
friendly and welcomed us with a smile.

647
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,600
"Hi, I'm Gina," she said. "You 
guys didn't need to hurry. We got-"

648
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:03,200
I stopped her and said, "The receptionist at 
the Madigan just phoned ahead and told you to  

649
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,000
expect us. We're looking for Patrick 
O'Neill. He's in danger and might be  

650
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,000
using a different name. Has anyone asked 
for him?" I showed her O'Neill's photograph.

651
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,200
"Oh yes," said Gina. "He's staying here,  

652
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:25,520
but under the name of Bernard Delaney. Nice, 
quiet guy. He stays in his room most of the time.  

653
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,360
There's something I don't understand. You're 
the second group of people asking about him.  

654
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,840
The others went up to his room five 
minutes ago, but they just left."

655
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,480
"What others?" I shouted.

656
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,680
"Three guys in black suits and 
dark glasses," she replied.  

657
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,680
"I thought they were the ones I was expecting."

658
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,080
"Did O'Neill leave with them?" I asked.

659
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,760
"No," Gina replied.

660
01:12:52,640 --> 01:13:03,840
"Oh my God! Give me the room number quick!" 
I shouted. "I hope we're not too late!"
 
 

661
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,360
CHAPTER NINE

662
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,600
The Metro, Avenue C

663
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,280
"Second floor, Room 219," said Gina.

664
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:22,240
No time to lose. Joe and I ran upstairs to the 
room. The door was open and the lock was broken.  

665
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,440
Inside, we could see that someone had quickly 
searched the room. An empty travel bag was lying  

666
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:35,200
on the floor. The blankets had been pulled off 
the bed, and clothes thrown around the room.

667
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:44,560
"O'Neill's not here, but those other guys won't 
be far away," I said. "I don't like this one bit.  

668
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,800
Let's get back to the lobby."

669
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:55,120
At the desk, I made a 911 call for the police, 
described the three guys and their car,  

670
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,480
and said, "I believe they're looking for 
Patrick O'Neill, who's staying at this hotel."

671
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,400
We walked out onto the street to wait for the 
police, who I knew ought to be here in minutes.  

672
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:16,240
But things now happened very quickly. A guy 
in dark glasses was standing opposite us,  

673
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:23,040
across the road. He laughed and said, 
"I guess you ain't going no place fast."

674
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:32,480
Then he began to cross the street, like he 
didn't need to hurry. He spoke again: "You guys.  

675
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Just tell me where O'Neill is. Then you 
can go home and forget you ever saw me.

676
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:48,400
He wanted O'Neill, but we had no idea where 
he might be. I looked left and right along  

677
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,920
the street. On either side of us was 
a guy in a black suit walking slowly  

678
01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:02,800
toward us. Both of them were carrying guns. 
We had no place to run, no place to hide.

679
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,360
Luckily, Joe was thinking more quickly than me.  

680
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:13,040
"Back inside the hotel, now!" he shouted 
and pushed me toward the entrance.

681
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:20,000
We turned and ran inside. Behind us I 
could hear the sound of running feet  

682
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,840
as they chased after us. "On the 
floor, behind the desk, now!" said Joe.

683
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:35,120
There was no time to say "If you please, ma'am" as 
I threw Gina to the ground. The front door opened  

684
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:43,280
with a crash, but Joe was ready for them. I heard 
two shots, followed by a scream, then everything  

685
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:50,480
was quiet. There was a cloud of smoke from 
the shots in the air. Joe was now at the desk.

686
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:56,000
"I think I hit one, but they'll be 
back," said Joe. "We have to hurry.  

687
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,920
Gina, you got to help us! 
Is there a back entrance?"

688
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,240
"Through here," replied Gina. "Follow me."

689
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,080
She led us through a door behind 
the desk, then down some steps.  

690
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,040
Behind us I heard a crash as the men in black 
returned. We were now hurrying through the  

691
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:23,680
hotel kitchen. I heard shouts and feet 
on the stairs. They were getting close.

692
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,720
"Turn off any lights and lock doors 
behind us if you can," I told Gina.

693
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:38,640
I decided to make things more difficult for the 
guys following us. I pulled glasses and bottles  

694
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,320
to the floor. We reached the back door just 
as we heard the men coming into the kitchen.  

695
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:51,520
There was a shot, which left a hole in the 
wall beside me. That was much too close.  

696
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,080
A second later, the room was in complete darkness  

697
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,840
as Gina turned off the lights. There 
were shouts as one of the guys fell over.

698
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,120
"Up these steps. Hurry!" said Gina.

699
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:14,480
We were now outside in the cold night air. We 
went up a few more steps, then out into a narrow  

700
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:21,920
street behind the hotel. In the darkness, I could 
just see back entrances to buildings along Avenue  

701
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:29,840
C. We had passed a few doors when Gina suddenly 
stopped. "I don't know what to do!" she screamed.

702
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,840
"Through this door, quickly," 
I ordered. "And get down!"

703
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,800
We hit the ground behind some boxes. 
It didn't smell too clean down there,  

704
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,760
but this wasn't the time to worry about the 
dry cleaner's bill. Gina had started to cry,  

705
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,600
so I put my hand over her mouth to keep her quiet.

706
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:59,920
"Don't make a sound,' Joe whispered. "With luck, 
the NYPD should arrive before they find us."

707
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,480
As we hid there in the darkness, we 
heard feet running to the left and  

708
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:13,200
right along the narrow street. Then we heard 
the steps returning more slowly, and voices.

709
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,040
"They got to be here someplace," said 
one. "They can't have gotten far."

710
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,840
"Start with these doors," said another. 
"Let's see where they're hiding."

711
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,640
There was crash after crash 
as the doors were opened.  

712
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:37,040
More shots. Well, that's one way to 
unlock a door if you don't have the key.  

713
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:48,560
The noise was now getting closer. I kept my hand 
over Gina's mouth. Her body was shaking. Finally,  

714
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:56,000
above the crashes and shots, a new but very 
welcome sound. The scream of a police car.

715
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:02,480
"It's the cops. Let's get out of here!" 
shouted a voice on the other side of the door.

716
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:09,040
We heard them running back toward 
the hotel. Then all went quiet.  

717
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,400
After waiting a few minutes, I 
decided it was safe to come out.

718
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,080
Back inside the hotel kitchen, it looked 
like the morning after a wild party.  

719
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:29,760
We walked carefully around the broken glasses 
and bottles on the floor. In the hotel lobby,  

720
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:36,880
two guys in black suits were lying on the 
floor. Above them stood two NYPD cops.

721
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,400
"Am I pleased to see you!" I said. "I'm 
Nat Marley, licensed private investigator.  

722
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,480
Did you catch all three of them?"

723
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:52,400
"Yes, sir. The other one is outside with 
the sergeant. He'll need an ambulance,"  

724
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,440
said one of the cops.

725
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
"We got here just in time,"  

726
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,560
said the other. "Captain Oldenberg's on 
his way. He'll need to question you."

727
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,280
Gina was feeling better. Her 
suit was black with dirt and oil.  

728
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:15,440
Mine didn't look much cleaner, though. Now 
I started to shake. It's always the same.  

729
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:22,080
It never hits me at the time, but later, 
when I realize I'm lucky to be alive.

730
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,280
"I guess I could make everyone coffee," said Gina.

731
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:35,040
"That'd be great." But then I had a sudden 
thought and shouted, "Joe, upstairs now!"

732
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:44,240
We ran back up to Room 219. The door was 
closed and when I knocked there was no reply.  

733
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,040
I put my ear to the door and listened. 
Somebody was moving around in the room.  

734
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,400
I tried to open the door, but there was 
something against it on the other side. However,  

735
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:07,280
it wasn't strong enough for Joe's boot and flew 
open. Inside we saw a man holding the travel bag.

736
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,000
He threw the bag into Joe's 
face and tried to push past me.  

737
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:18,160
But I was able to catch his coat and 
pull him to the floor. I looked at him  

738
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:28,000
closely - a middle-aged guy with gray hair 
and black metal glasses - Patrick O'Neill.

739
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,640
"Don't be afraid!" I said. "I'm 
Nat Marley, private investigator.  

740
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:41,840
I'm working for your wife, Joyce. You're 
going be safe. It's time to stop running."
 
 

741
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,640
CHAPTER TEN

742
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,880
Time to fight back

743
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:57,200
There was a hopeless look in O'Neill's 
eyes. His lips moved, but he couldn't speak.  

744
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,360
I shook his shoulders and 
made him look straight at me.  

745
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:10,320
"Listen, we're the good guys. You're out 
of danger. Your wife sent us to find you."

746
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:18,480
He still seemed to be unsure, so I pulled him to 
his feet and tried again. "Here's my cellphone.  

747
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,960
It's calling my office number. As 
soon as my personal assistant answers,  

748
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,120
ask to speak to Joyce."

749
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:32,640
We waited while he spoke to his wife. 
He sat down on the bed as he talked.  

750
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,840
Now he looked tired and weak, like a lost child.

751
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,360
"If you don't mind, Mr. O'Neill, I need to 
talk to my personal assistant now," I said.  

752
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,920
He returned my cellphone.

753
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:55,680
"Stella, listen carefully," I said. "Call 
a cab, and take Mrs. O'Neill to Frankie's  

754
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,880
Cocktail Lounge on 5th Street. We're going 
to meet you there as soon as possible.  

755
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,480
We need to make Oldenberg believe that 
O'Neill is not Steinmann's killer."

756
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,760
Now O'Neill was beginning to look more normal.  

757
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:20,560
"I guess I should say sorry," he said. 
"How did you know where to find me?"

758
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,840
"I can explain that," I replied. "Through 
information in your bank accounts,  

759
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,840
we learned that you'd made payments to a Van 
Zandt. That's how we found your old friend Frank."

760
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,040
"So you know about the poker games,"  

761
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:45,120
said O'Neill. "When I told Joyce I 
was working late, I was actually-"

762
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,080
"It doesn't matter now," I said. "Van Zandt 
told us that you'd checked into a hotel  

763
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:59,280
somewhere in the East Village. You heard about 
Steinmann's murder? The police think you did it,  

764
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,440
but I didn't think that could be true. 
So I thought you might be in danger too.  

765
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,080
But how did you get away from 
the guys in black suits?"

766
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:17,680
"I was watching the street from my window," 
began O'Neill. "I saw them arrive and thought  

767
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:23,440
they had to be bad news. I ran up to the 
top floor and hid in a blanket cupboard.  

768
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:30,160
I'd been up there for about ten minutes when 
I heard the shots. So I stayed there until  

769
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:37,600
I heard the police car arrive and came down to 
my floor. When I looked out of my window again,  

770
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:44,320
I could see the sergeant outside with one of them. 
Finally, I thought it was safe enough to escape."

771
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:51,600
"That letter you sent to Van Zandt. What 
do all those numbers mean?" I asked.

772
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,840
"They're the reason why Steinmann 
was murdered," replied O'Neill.

773
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:05,840
Suddenly, there was someone at the door. 
It was Captain Oldenberg. He looked around,  

774
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:13,920
shook his head and asked in a tired voice, "Would 
you mind telling me what's going on, Marley?"

775
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:23,280
"Oldenberg, let me introduce Mr. Patrick O'Neill. 
Mr. O'Neill was almost murdered here tonight.  

776
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,600
Thanks to the sergeant and his 
team, we're all still alive.  

777
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:35,840
Mr. O'Neill has a story to tell you. I 
believe that once you know all the facts,  

778
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,840
it will be clear that he 
can't be Steinmann's killer."

779
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,600
"I'm listening, Marley," said Oldenberg.  

780
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,520
"But whether he's the killer is 
for the police to decide, not you."

781
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:56,400
"Mr. O'Neill can show you all the information 
you need," I continued. "If you agree,  

782
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:02,720
it means a quick journey to Frankie's Cocktail 
Lounge on 5 th Street. Everything's there."

783
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,040
"Agreed," said Oldenberg. 
"But for the moment, O'Neill,  

784
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:14,400
you're still wanted for murder, and 
that means you're my prisoner. Anyway,  

785
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,240
I guess Police Headquarters will 
be rather safer than this hotel."

786
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,760
We all went downstairs, back to reception, 
where Oldenberg organized everyone.  

787
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,000
"Sergeant, you're coming with me and O'Neill. 
Have your men take away the other two prisoners  

788
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,840
and one officer should stay 
with the guy who was shot."

789
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,200
Joe had to leave and get some help with his car.  

790
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,080
Oldenberg drove us through the 
East Village back to 5th Street.  

791
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:52,160
Frankie's Cocktail Lounge was now noisy with the 
evening crowd. A jazz band was getting ready to  

792
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:58,960
play. I saw Stella and Mrs. O'Neill sitting 
at a corner table, waiting for us to arrive.

793
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,560
"Your husband's outside, 
Mrs. O'Neill," I told her.  

794
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,320
"If you could be patient for a few more minutes, 
I'll find somewhere less public to talk."

795
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,920
I went over to the bar and shouted 
above the noise to the bartender.  

796
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,400
"I need to speak to Frank. Where can I find him?"

797
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,600
"In the back room," answered the 
bartender. "Just go straight through."

798
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:35,280
I coughed as I entered because the air was heavy 
with cigarette smoke. "O'Neill's outside with  

799
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:42,160
the police," I said. "Could we meet in 
here? Oh, and we'll need that envelope."

800
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:49,280
"Sure. Let's get some fresh air in here," 
said Van Zandt as he threw open a window.  

801
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,600
Oldenberg brought O'Neill into the room, 
and Stella followed with Mrs. O'Neill.

802
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:04,080
As soon as everybody was inside the office, 
O'Neill took his wife in his arms. "It's wonderful  

803
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:11,200
to see you again, Joyce," he said. "I'm going 
to stop hiding. Now it's time to fight back."

804
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:19,920
"Patrick, I've been so worried for you," she said. 
"What's been happening? Why all these secrets?"

805
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:28,560
"There's so much to ex plain," replied O'Neill. 
"I'll tell you everything, I promise. But first,  

806
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,280
I have to make the captain understand that 
I'm not to blame for Steinmann's death."

807
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:41,120
O'Neill turned to Oldenberg and opened 
the envelope. He took out the papers and  

808
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:47,920
laid them on the table. He said, "These 
are secret papers from the Ocean Star  

809
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:53,680
president's office. There's enough information 
here to send Lorraine Houston to jail."

810
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,080
"If you could keep it short," said Oldenberg.

811
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:06,400
"OK. Ocean Star is an investment firm. Its 
business is making money for its clients,"  

812
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:13,520
continued O'Neill. "How do they do this? By 
investing clients' money in the international  

813
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:21,360
money markets - or that's what should happen. 
Look at this page. It's organized in two halves,  

814
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:26,960
so let's compare the two sides. On the 
left the numbers show money that was paid  

815
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:35,280
to clients - often a fifteen per cent return. On 
the right we see what the firm actually made from  

816
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:44,400
investments. Surprise, surprise! These numbers 
are far less. You realize what this means?"

817
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,680
"Go on, tell me," said Oldenberg. 
"You're the accountant."

818
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:56,880
"Ocean Star can't possibly earn enough from 
its investments to pay big money to the clients  

819
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,280
and millions to the president. It's using the 
money from new clients to pay the old clients.  

820
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:09,120
As long as it continues to get large 
numbers of new clients, this can work,  

821
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:15,280
and people think it's the smartest firm on 
Wall Street. However, it's a serious crime.  

822
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,160
I believe that's why Steinmann was 
murdered. He knew about it too after  

823
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:28,080
I showed him these accounts, and he talked 
to Houston. I want to make all this public,  

824
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:35,760
and now I don't care if it destroys Ocean Star 
at the same time. Is that clear, Captain?"

825
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:43,760
"More or less," replied Oldenberg. "If 
I could take those papers... Thanks.  

826
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:51,040
But there are a lot more questions which I want 
answered. We'll continue at Police Headquarters.  

827
01:30:52,240 --> 01:31:02,080
Mr. O'Neill, you're still my prisoner."
 
 

828
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,960
CHAPTER ELEVEN

829
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,040
O'Neill's story

830
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:14,080
At Police Headquarters, Oldenberg led us 
up to his office. I'd sent Stella home - at  

831
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:20,320
least one of us should try and get a good night's 
sleep. Mrs. O'Neill wouldn't leave her husband.

832
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:28,320
Inside Oldenberg's office, it couldn't be more 
different from the offices I'd seen at Ocean Star.  

833
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:35,840
The walls were a dirty green color and there 
was no carpeting on the floor. "Basic" was  

834
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,840
the best word to describe it. Oldenberg had 
ordered coffee and sandwiches for everybody.  

835
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,600
At least the NYPD coffee tasted better 
than it used to when I was a cop.

836
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,600
"You have a story to tell us, Mr. O'Neill,"  

837
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:57,840
said Oldenberg. "I want to know everything 
about you, Steinmann and Ocean Star."

838
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:07,440
"OK. Two years ago, the old department head 
moved to another firm," began O'Neill. "I'd  

839
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:12,800
worked at Ocean Star for over eight years and I 
thought I had a good chance of getting the job.  

840
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,360
I was wrong - the president, Lorraine Houston,  

841
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:22,800
had decided to bring in someone new. 
Someone who didn't care who he hurt.

842
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:31,200
"So I went on with my work and did what was 
necessary. With Steinmann as head of department,  

843
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:36,400
the firm was making even more money than 
before. Houston thought he was wonderful,  

844
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:43,520
but people who were working with me thought the 
opposite. Steinmann loved to push people hard.

845
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:50,640
"A year ago, I asked Steinmann how the firm could 
continue paying so much money to its clients.  

846
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:58,960
The money our department made from clients' 
investments wasn't that high. I did the math again  

847
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,200
and still didn't understand. 
Where was the money coming from?  

848
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:10,960
I was worried, but Steinmann promised me that 
there were no problems. He said, 'Just do your  

849
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:17,040
job and don't ask too many questions. She 
knows what she's doing on the top floor.'

850
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:24,800
"The 'top floor' is where Lorraine Houston 
has her offices. Steinmann hoped to get his  

851
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:34,240
own office there some day. It seemed impossible to 
talk to him, so I kept my mouth shut. Time passed  

852
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:41,920
and Ocean Star went on paying out big money to 
its clients. Then, on Friday morning last week,  

853
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,240
I received the information that could destroy 
the firm and send Lorraine Houston to jail.

854
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,000
"It happened by chance. I got 
a letter from Houston's office.  

855
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:01,600
At first I didn't understand why I'd been sent 
a hard copy of the accounts - usually everything  

856
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:09,840
like that is sent through office email. I soon 
realized that it had been a mistake. Houston's  

857
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,720
personal assistant had sent me an envelope 
which was meant to go to the vice-president.

858
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:25,040
"I knew I shouldn't, but I continued reading. 
As I read, I was more and more surprised. Now  

859
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:31,760
I understood that the public accounts weren't the 
truth. These were secret accounts, which weren't  

860
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,800
on computer. They showed that Ocean Star was using 
the money from its new clients to pay the old  

861
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:47,680
ones. Now I understood how Houston had so much to 
spend on her cars, homes, clothes and vacations.

862
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:56,560
"I didn't like the idea, but I thought I should 
talk with Steinmann. I knew I had to be careful,  

863
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,840
so I made a copy of the accounts to show him.  

864
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:07,440
What about the ones I'd received? How could I get 
the information out of the building safely? I had  

865
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:13,840
an idea - I put the accounts in an envelope and 
addressed it to my old friend Frank Van Zandt.  

866
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,360
Then I left the building for five minutes and 
dropped the envelope in the nearest mailbox.

867
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:27,040
"Later that morning, I spoke with Steinmann, 
and gave him the copy of the accounts. He  

868
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,880
was immediately very interested. He 
laughed and said, 'So that's how she  

869
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,400
does it. You've done the right thing. I'll 
go straight upstairs and talk with Houston.  

870
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:45,200
With this information, I could make a lot 
of money. Maybe I'll share some with you.'

871
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:54,880
"His plan was to ask Houston to pay him to keep 
quiet. I became really angry with him and tried  

872
01:35:54,880 --> 01:36:02,240
to make him change his mind. But he refused. 
He wouldn't listen to me and went up to the top  

873
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:09,840
floor. Now I knew that I could be in real trouble 
because Steinmann had gotten the accounts from me.  

874
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,280
I wasn't sure what to do, but my first 
move was to get out of the office quick.

875
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:22,080
"I told my personal assistant that I'd had 
an awful headache all day and had to go home.  

876
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:30,080
Back home, I waited a couple of hours, then made 
some phone calls. First I called Steinmann's  

877
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:35,680
personal assistant. She told me that Steinmann's 
desk was empty and his computer was gone,  

878
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:43,120
but she couldn't tell me anything more. I sent 
Steinmann an angry email to his home computer.  

879
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:49,920
I wrote something like, 'I didn't think you could 
be so stupid. I can't believe what you've done.'

880
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:57,040
"The next day, I felt bad about what I'd 
said in the email, so I tried to phone  

881
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:03,520
Steinmann. His wife answered and told me that 
he hadn't come home, and she was very worried.  

882
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,240
That night, I stayed up late 
thinking about what I should do.  

883
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:17,360
Just before midnight I got a call. Someone said, 
'You have information which belongs to the firm.  

884
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:23,120
Return this information to Ms. Houston by 
midday tomorrow if you want to stay alive.'

885
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:32,640
"How could I return the accounts? They were in 
the U.S. Mail. So I thought the safest thing to do  

886
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:40,640
was to hide. I wrote a note for Joyce and 
left in the middle of the night. Looking back,  

887
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,200
maybe it wasn't the most intelligent decision.  

888
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:49,600
I packed a bag, left by the back entrance, 
took a cab to Frank Van Zandt's place.  

889
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:58,720
I can promise you I left my car on Henry Street. I 
told Frank to expect the letter with the accounts,  

890
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:05,360
then I checked into a hotel. On Monday 
morning I took out $10,000 from the bank  

891
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:11,920
so I wouldn't need to use any credit cards. 
I think you know the rest of the story."

892
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:18,480
"Thanks, Mr. O'Neill," said 
Oldenberg. "That's very helpful."

893
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:26,800
Oldenberg led me to another office. He 
thought for a few moments, then said,  

894
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:35,120
"Marley, I need some advice. My 
problem is this - if I accept  

895
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:40,240
that Houston ordered Steinmann's 
murder, how can I show that it's true?"

896
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:48,560
"If you'll allow me, Captain," I said. 
"I got an idea that just might work."
 
 

897
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,520
CHAPTER TWELVE

898
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,160
If the price is right

899
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:07,360
What if nobody knew that O'Neill was at Police 
Headquarters? That would give us the chance to  

900
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:15,440
tell some clever lies - lies that might give us 
the advantage. I shared my ideas with the captain.

901
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:22,000
"We don't know for sure, but let's say 
Lorraine Houston planned Steinmann's murder,"  

902
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,640
I began. "She's killed one person and she 
wants O'Neill badly enough to kill again.  

903
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:37,360
Why don't we try out this plan? Give the news of 
what happened at the Metro Hotel tonight to the  

904
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:45,920
newspapers, TV and radio stations. Some of it 
can be true, but a few things can be changed.  

905
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:52,640
We tell them that O'Neill escaped and is believed 
to be somewhere in the East Village area.  

906
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:57,920
Houston will be very afraid. She has a lot to lose  

907
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,520
if she doesn't find O'Neill 
first and stop him from talking."

908
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,840
"OK, Marley. So far, so good. 
What next?" asked Oldenberg.

909
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,000
"If you agree, I could speak with her.  

910
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,600
I'll tell her I have something 
to sell - the secret accounts."

911
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:28,000
"Go on," said Oldenberg. "I'm interested. But 
why you? Why couldn't an NYPD officer do it?"

912
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:35,600
"I'll tell her I've found O'Neill and am keeping 
him someplace safe - where she'll never find  

913
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:42,960
him. I'll also tell her I have the accounts, 
which I'll offer to sell if the price is right.  

914
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:52,240
I'll make her an offer which she can't refuse. 
For $100,000 I'll return the accounts to her  

915
01:40:52,240 --> 01:41:00,720
and give O'Neill to the police. Houston will think 
she has won. The secret accounts will be safe and  

916
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:07,680
O'Neill will be in jail for Steinmann's murder. 
I'll meet with her, then try and get her to talk."

917
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:15,520
"Come on, Marley. Get real!" said Oldenberg. 
"You think a hard businesswoman like Houston  

918
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,840
is just going to say, 'Oh, by the 
way, I ordered Steinmann's murder.'"

919
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,800
"I'll let her think I'm the 
same sort of person as her,"  

920
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:30,800
I continued. "A businessman who 
doesn't care how he earns his money  

921
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:37,200
or who he hurts. If she feels comfortable 
with me, then we might get the truth."

922
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:45,840
"This had better work, Marley. I hope 
you're a good enough actor," said Oldenberg.

923
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:53,200
"Believe me, Oldenberg, on a good 
day I could win Oscars," I told him.

924
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:03,920
"All right. We'll do it," replied Oldenberg. "This 
could be dangerous. You know that as well as I do.  

925
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:07,360
You'll need a full NYPD team behind you.  

926
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,240
I'll organize that as soon as you and 
Houston have a time and a place to meet.  

927
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,120
So now I'll talk to the newspapers and Houston 
will think that O'Neill is still in hiding."

928
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:27,840
"OK. And one more thing," I said. "Mrs. O'Neill 
and her daughter Julia could be in real danger.  

929
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,520
Could you move them to an NYPD safe house?"

930
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,320
"Consider it done," said Oldenberg.

931
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,680
* * *

932
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:45,600
Wednesday had been a very long day. I got 
home at three o'clock in the morning and I  

933
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:52,000
was so tired that I felt like a dead man 
walking. I fell into bed and slept well.

934
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,880
The next morning I woke up 
late, feeling much better.  

935
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,480
After quickly getting dressed, I ran down to 
the nearest newsstand and picked up the morning  

936
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:10,320
newspapers. I took the papers into Slim Pete's 
Diner on Main Street to read more carefully.  

937
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,520
The name "Slim" is a joke. Actually, 
he has a serious weight problem.

938
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,040
"What'll it be, Mr. Marley?" 
asked Pete with a big smile.

939
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:28,160
"Eggs, pancakes and bacon," I answered. 
"And make that coffee strong, will you?"

940
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:34,160
"You got it. So what's the 
famous Mr. Marley doing today?"  

941
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:37,840
asked Pete. "Helping New York's 
Finest win the war against crime?

942
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,280
"Something like that," I replied.

943
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:51,120
"New York's Finest" - that's what people call 
the NYPD. I never thought of myself as one of  

944
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:58,480
the "Finest" when I was a cop and I never thought 
I was fighting a war. I was just doing my job.  

945
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:06,160
If there was a little less crime on the streets by 
the end of the day, that was good enough for me.

946
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:15,840
I read through the newspapers. Oldenberg 
had done an excellent job. The O'Neill story  

947
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:24,800
was on all the front pages. The headline of the 
Daily News read, "NYPD's MOST WANTED ESCAPES".  

948
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:34,160
The New York Post headline made me 
smile: "KILLER ACCOUNTANT ON THE RUN".  

949
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:41,440
There was some truth, but the rest of the story 
sounded like something from the movies: "This man  

950
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:48,880
is both intelligent and dangerous," said Captain 
Oldenberg. This wasn't the O'Neill that I knew.

951
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,080
While I ate my breakfast, I watched the TV news.  

952
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:02,880
Their reporter said, "This is Cindy Lu outside 
the Metro Hotel on Avenue C. Here, last night,  

953
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:09,200
NYPD officers almost caught Patrick O'Neill, the 
man wanted for the murder of Ronald Steinmann..."

954
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:16,160
"Well done, Oldenberg," I thought. 
Now Houston would get a clear message.  

955
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:21,200
Neither her people nor the NYPD had found O'Neill,  

956
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:29,840
so she still had a real problem on her hands. 
I hoped she was one very worried woman.

957
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:35,840
I got to the office by ten o'clock. Stella 
had already been there a couple of hours.  

958
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,280
"That was quite a day, yesterday. 
You feeling OK, now?" she asked.

959
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,320
"A lot better," I replied. "And thank you 
for taking care of Mrs. O'Neill all day.  

960
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:53,040
With luck, we're going to send 
Lorraine Houston to jail."

961
01:45:55,360 --> 01:46:01,680
During the morning I agreed on a plan with 
Oldenberg. I would meet with Houston in a  

962
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:08,240
public area, the kind of place where it would 
be easy for an NYPD team to watch and wait.  

963
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:16,480
Our choice was Battery Park, at the foot of 
Manhattan, with its tall trees and green grass.  

964
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,000
This is where New York meets the ocean.  

965
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:26,800
From here you can look across Upper New York 
Bay to the Statue of Liberty and Staten Island.

966
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:35,040
I tried to get through to Houston on my cellphone, 
but her personal assistant wouldn't allow me to  

967
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:41,600
speak with her. "I'm sorry, sir, but Ms. 
Houston isn't taking any calls," she said.

968
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:51,200
I wasn't going to take "no" for an answer. "Listen 
carefully and just do what I say. Your boss  

969
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:57,440
lost something of great importance. Tell her 
I've found it and want to return it to her.  

970
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:03,600
I'll call back in ten minutes and expect 
to speak with her in person. Understood?"

971
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:14,480
"Careful, now," I told myself. "No mistakes." I 
waited a full fifteen minutes before calling back.  

972
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:23,040
People think less clearly when they get impatient. 
This time I got ahold of Houston immediately.

973
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,920
"Who are you and what do you 
want?" she asked crossly.

974
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,800
"The name's Marley. I was working for Mr. O'Neill.  

975
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,360
He found some interesting papers of 
yours, which he gave me to look after.  

976
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:46,160
Now I'm working for myself and I thought that you 
might like to have those papers back. I'll make  

977
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:52,960
this offer even more generous. The police will be 
very interested when I tell them where O'Neill is.  

978
01:47:54,080 --> 01:48:01,600
The price is $100,000. Wait in your office for 
my call at eight o'clock tomorrow morning."

979
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,120
"What?" began Houston.

980
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:12,080
"That's it, lady!" I shouted. "Be ready in your 
office, eight o'clock tomorrow with $100,000, OK?  

981
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:18,080
And don't think of doing anything clever or 
every newspaper in this city will know the  

982
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:20,240
truth about Ocean Star's accounts."

983
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:27,760
With that, I ended the call. I 
felt very pleased with myself.  

984
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,160
Would I still feel so pleased tomorrow?
 
 

985
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,520
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

986
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,280
Battery Park

987
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,760
Friday, October 8th, 7:00 a.m.  

988
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:55,520
I was on my way from Grand Central Station to 
Bowling Green on a number five train. This subway  

989
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:01,600
station is just north of Battery Park, which 
was where I was going to meet Lorraine Houston.

990
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:09,760
Battery Park is a public area where it would 
be easier for the NYPD team to watch and wait.  

991
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,960
I thought that Houston would feel 
uncomfortable away from the deep  

992
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,840
carpets and expensive furniture of her offices.

993
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:25,600
From the subway station, it was just a few 
minutes' walk to Battery Park. I walked across  

994
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:33,280
to the Sphere, a famous piece of public art at the 
north end of the park - a large gold metal ball,  

995
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:41,360
as tall as a house. Oldenberg's team was already 
waiting there with hidden cameras, though you  

996
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:48,960
wouldn't know they were police officers. Two young 
guys talking on a seat. A couple standing under an  

997
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:56,960
umbrella. Their orders were to watch and wait. But 
if I waved my hat, they would immediately help me.

998
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:02,960
The sky was full of black clouds 
and it was starting to rain.  

999
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:10,240
I put up my umbrella and looked at my watch. 
It was eight o'clock, time to call Houston.

1000
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:18,000
"Ms. Houston? I'm waiting for you," I 
said. "Bring the money and come alone.  

1001
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,440
If there's any trouble, my personal 
assistant has a copy of your accounts  

1002
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:31,120
ready to email to every newspaper in New York. 
If all goes to plan, she'll destroy that copy."

1003
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:39,040
"OK. That's understood," she replied. 
"How do I know you're telling the truth?"

1004
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:46,240
"Ask yourself this question: What will 
happen if you don't believe me? I'll need  

1005
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:53,840
your cellphone number... Thanks. Now, leave the 
building and wait outside the front entrance."

1006
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,800
I let her wait a few minutes in the 
cold. I wanted her to feel angry and  

1007
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:06,800
impatient by the time she arrived at 
Battery Park. Now for my next call.

1008
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:16,160
"So sorry to keep you waiting," I lied. "You see 
a tall white-haired guy in a dark green overcoat,  

1009
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:20,240
carrying a copy of the Wall Street 
Journal?. He should be opposite you,  

1010
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,960
standing by a cab." Houston 
said she could see him.

1011
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:33,840
"That's my assistant, Mr. Blaney. Go and talk with 
him," I continued. "He has a cab waiting for you."

1012
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,200
We had to make sure that Houston arrived alone.  

1013
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:46,880
Joe Blaney's job was to make sure that 
she took our cab - a cab with an NYPD  

1014
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,880
driver. Houston was going to be taken 
on a little tour of Lower Manhattan.  

1015
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,920
We were going to take our time and make sure she 
was in a very bad mood by the time she met me.

1016
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,560
Thirty minutes later I called Houston again.

1017
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:11,120
"Tell the driver to drop you at the north 
entrance to Battery Park, opposite Bowling  

1018
01:52:11,120 --> 01:52:17,920
Green. Then walk south to the Sphere. You'll 
see me holding a blue and white golf umbrella.  

1019
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:25,040
By the way, you don't need to pay the 
driver. Hope you enjoyed your sightseeing."

1020
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:35,520
I wouldn't like to repeat Houston's reply - such 
bad language! The rain was beginning to fall more  

1021
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:43,120
heavily as I saw her. She was tall and slim and 
was wearing a red suit with a short skirt that  

1022
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:51,440
showed a lot of leg. She really wasn't dressed 
for the weather. I turned on my little secret  

1023
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:58,400
recorder. I waved to her and sat on a park 
seat under the trees opposite the Sphere.

1024
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,960
"This had better be good, Marley," 
she said. "Do you have my papers?"

1025
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,920
"Not so fast," I replied. "Do you have my money?"

1026
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:17,920
She put her case on her knees and opened it. 
Inside, it was packed with hundred-dollar bills.

1027
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,440
"Count it if you like," she said.

1028
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:26,480
"Don't you think the park 
looks lovely in fall?" I asked.

1029
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:32,080
"I don't have all day. Hurry up and give 
me the papers," she said impatiently.

1030
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,440
I slowly reached into my case 
and took out an envelope,  

1031
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:42,560
which I gave to her. Then I reached 
into my coat pocket for my cellphone.

1032
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,520
Houston took a single piece 
of paper out of the envelope  

1033
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:51,360
and looked at me like a dog 
which was about to bite.

1034
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:55,200
"Give me the rest of the accounts, 
Marley, or you're dead meat!"  

1035
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,720
She had taken a small gun out of her 
purse and was pressing it into my side.

1036
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:07,760
"Not very intelligent, Ms. Houston," I 
said. "Remember, if anything happens to me,  

1037
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:12,160
my personal assistant will email your 
accounts to every newspaper in this city.  

1038
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,560
If I press 'Send', my personal 
assistant gets that message.  

1039
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:23,440
Also, shooting people in public isn't 
a good idea. You'll get the rest of  

1040
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:30,000
the papers. Just be patient. Like any good 
businessman, I like to count my money first."

1041
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:37,120
She gave me a cold, hard look through narrow 
eyes, then put the gun back in her purse.  

1042
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,800
Now she was beginning to shake with the cold.

1043
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:44,640
"Here, take my overcoat," I said.

1044
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:51,840
She took the coat and put it over her shoulders. 
She smiled for the first time and thanked me.  

1045
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,520
Now I felt I might have the advantage.

1046
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:02,080
I quickly checked the money, then took a second 
envelope from my case and held it in front of her.

1047
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:10,160
"There must be some very important information 
here. You're one smart businesswoman, Ms. Houston,  

1048
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:15,040
and a good employer. I like the way you 
find answers to problems with your people.  

1049
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,000
Like sending Steinmann on his 
final drive in O'Neill's car.  

1050
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:28,320
Good work. The police think that O'Neill is the 
killer. That way you can be completely sure it's  

1051
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:35,200
the end of your trouble with those two. As soon as 
I tell the police where O'Neill is, you're safe."

1052
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,000
She smiled again. "You're a smart guy.  

1053
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm sorry about Steinmann. He was good at his job, 
until he started to think he was smarter than me.  

1054
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,160
I couldn't let him tell me what 
to do. I had to get rid of him."

1055
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,160
At last I had it, and 
everything was on the recorder.  

1056
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:07,360
I passed her the second envelope. She opened it 
quickly, took out the papers and counted them.

1057
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,960
"Looks like it's all here. It's 
been good doing business with you,"  

1058
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:20,560
she said, and returned my overcoat. "Now just 
make sure the police get ahold of O'Neill."

1059
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:30,240
As she walked away, I called to her, "Actually, 
Ms. Houston, I got a message from O'Neill.  

1060
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:36,480
He'd like to tell you, 'Smile! 
You're on a police camera!"'

1061
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:42,960
I waved my hat in the air. Houston 
screamed and pulled out her gun,  

1062
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:49,600
but in seconds the NYPD team was all around 
her. She dropped the gun and fell to the ground.

1063
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:56,800
A minute ago she had been the president of 
Ocean Star Finance and a very rich woman.  

1064
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,520
Now she was going to spend many years in jail.

1065
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,760
I called Oldenberg to tell him the news.  

1066
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:11,840
"Good work, Marley!" he said. 
"O'Neill will soon be a free man."

1067
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:21,520
The rain had stopped and the sun had begun to 
break through the heavy clouds. In the sunshine,  

1068
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:28,480
leaves were dropping from the trees and turning 
in the wind. The air from the ocean smelled fresh  

1069
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:37,840
and clean. It felt good to be alive. I should 
spend more time in this city's parks.
 
 
 
 

1070
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:35,120
-  

1071
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:35,493
THE END -
