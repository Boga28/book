CHAPTER ONE
The Grey Family

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,100
My father, Richard Grey, was a vicar in the
north of England, who was respected by everybody

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,140
who knew him.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,170
He lived quite well on a small salary and
had a pleasant little house of his own.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,220
My mother was the daughter of a rich landowner
and she married my father against the wishes

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,470
of her friends and family.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,120
If she became the poor vicar's wife, they
told her, she would have to give up her carriage,

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,900
her lady's maid and the chance to live in
a large, beautiful house.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,850
A carriage and a maid were certainly nice
things to have; but luckily my mother had

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,500
feet to carry her and hands to dress herself.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,550
And a large, beautiful house would be pleasant,
but she would rather live in a cottage with

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,600
Richard Grey than in a palace with any other
man in the world.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,000
Her father told her that she could marry the
vicar if she wanted to, but that if she did,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,770
she would lose her fortune.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,079
However, my mother was a strong woman who
knew what she wanted.

16
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,579
So the couple got married and my mother's
fortune was given to her sister.

17
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:16,130
Despite these difficulties and their simple
life, I believe that you could search the

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,789
whole of England and not find a couple who
were happier than they were.

19
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:26,670
My mother gave birth to six children, but
my sister Mary and I were the only two that

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,880
survived the dangers of early childhood.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,509
I was six years younger than Mary, so I was
always a little spoilt because I was the 'baby'

22
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:35,590
of the family.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,649
We lived a very protected life and my sister
and I did not go to school.

24
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:47,250
Instead, our mother, who was hardworking and
very well educated, taught us at home.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,590
Sometimes we went to a tea party at a nearby
house or visited our father's parents and

26
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,560
other elderly family members.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,200
Mostly, however, we heard about the world
through the stories our mother told us about

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,509
her younger days and of carriages, parties
and big elegant houses.

29
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,281
While these stories entertained us, they often
made me secretly wish that I could see more

30
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,200
of the world.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,950
My mother seemed very happy and told her husband
that she had everything that she needed in

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,950
life.

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,490
However, my father worried that his wife had
given up too much in order to marry him.

34
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:31,250
As a result, he was always thinking about
how he could make more money.

35
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,450
One day, a kind friend suggested to him a
way of making a lot of money within just a

36
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,450
few weeks.

37
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:43,400
This friend was a merchant, a man who made
money by buying and selling goods.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,860
If my father lent him some money, he said,
he would make them both rich.

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,200
My father took the chance and gave the man
all the money he had.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,950
The friendly merchant used the money to buy
goods and then arranged for them to be sent

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,070
abroad on ships to be sold.

42
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,140
My father was excited and so were we all.

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,260
We were going to be rich!

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,480
We spent happy hours by the fire talking about
what we would do, where we would travel and

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,930
what we would buy with the money that would
surely soon arrive.

46
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,400
The weeks passed but then the terrible news
came.

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,500
The ship, which contained the goods and therefore
our fortune, had been caught in a terrible

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
storm.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,640
It had sunk to the bottom of the sea along
with the goods it carried and the unlucky

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
merchant himself.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,220
I was young and did not understand how serious
this loss was, but I could see how it had

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,030
upset my parents and this worried me.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,230
My mother concentrated on taking care of what
little money we still had, and on cheering

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,530
up my father.

55
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,230
He, on the other hand, lost all hope and became
desperate.

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,770
He believed that this recent poor decision
had made his wife's life even worse.

57
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:10,630
Over time, he became ill with the worry of
it all and none of us could give him any hope.

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,600
We had a pony - a little horse - but we had
to sell it.

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,720
We stopped buying new clothes and we used
everything we had as carefully as we possibly

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,129
could.

61
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:27,770
My father dismissed one of our two servants
and my mother and sister began to help with

62
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,020
the cooking.

63
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,389
I offered to help, too, but although I thought
of myself as a young woman, I was still a

64
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,029
child in the eyes of my family.

65
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:42,710
My mother would send me away, saying, 'No,
Agnes, there's nothing here you can do.

66
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,710
It's much easier for me to do it myself.

67
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,939
Go and help your sister.'

68
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:55,020
Then I would go to my sister and say, 'Mary,
Mother says that I should help you.'

69
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,419
To which Mary used to reply, 'No, you are
too young to help me, sweet Agnes, go and

70
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,559
play the piano, or play with the cat.'

71
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:11,669
During this difficult time, I never once heard
my mother complain.

72
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:15,909
When the summer came, though, she and Mary
talked about ways in which they could make

73
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,960
a little more money.

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,560
They wanted to give Father a much-needed holiday
by the sea.

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,370
'I wish I could do something,' I said one
day.

76
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,050
'You, Agnes!'

77
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,569
they both cried.

78
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,529
'Yes, I've had an idea...,' I began nervously.

79
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:38,439
'Really?' said my mother.

80
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,750
'Tell us what it is.'

81
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,610
'I would like to be a governess,' I replied
quietly.

82
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:53,650
My mother said nothing and Mary, who had been
holding a book, dropped it in surprise and

83
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,569
cried, 'You, Agnes?

84
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,059
You want to be a governess?'

85
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,779
'Well, yes.

86
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,759
I don't think it's such a strange idea.

87
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,029
Surely, I could teach little children... and
I think I would enjoy it...

88
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:14,279
I like children,' I explained, 'Please let
me, Mother!'

89
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:21,490
'My child,' said my mother kindly, 'You have
not learnt to take care of yourself yet.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,309
Young children need someone who is experienced
to look after them.'

91
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:34,789
'But I am eighteen now,' I told her, 'and
I can take care of myself, and others too.

92
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:39,560
You do not know how capable I am, because
I haven't had a chance to try.

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,159
Just let me try, that is all I ask of you.'

94
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,669
At that moment, my father came into the room
and heard about my idea.

95
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:53,960
He agreed that I was not ready to become a
governess and gently said that I was too young

96
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,220
to leave home.

97
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,960
The subject was not mentioned again, but I
could think of nothing else.

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,729
How wonderful it would be to be a governess!

99
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:12,680
To go out into the world; to start a new life;
to make my own decisions; to earn my own money,

100
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,039
and give some help to my family; to show them
what 'little' Agnes could do.

101
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,520
I felt sure that I would be a good governess.

102
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,729
Three or four days later, I mentioned the
idea again to my mother.

103
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,639
With some difficulty, I persuaded her to speak
to my father.

104
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,029
It was not long before my father and sister
had warmed to the idea and my mother began

105
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,639
to look for a job for me.

106
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,129
After a few weeks, I was offered the job of
taking care of the young family of Mrs Bloomfield,

107
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,610
who was a friend of one of our distant family
members.

108
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,800
The salary was only twenty-five pounds a year
and my parents advised me not to take the

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
job.

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,080
However, I had no other job offers and because
I was young and wanted to work, I happily

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,259
accepted the offer.

112
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:07,119
Several weeks of preparation followed and
I could not wait to start my new job.

113
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:14,169
Finally, September came and my new clothes
had been made and my bags had been packed.

114
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,800
I had taken my last walk with Mary, I had
sung my last song to my father; and I had

115
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,580
said goodbye to the little cat.

116
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,030
When it was time to go to bed and I saw my
empty cupboards, I suddenly felt nervous and

117
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,389
wondered if I had made the right decision.

118
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,940
But in the morning I felt excited again.

119
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,210
I washed, dressed, ate breakfast and kissed
my family goodbye.

120
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:46,331
I climbed up into the small, open carriage
and waved to my mother and sister as the carriage

121
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:49,020
began to move away down the hill.

122
00:08:49,020 --> 00:09:08,910
Then, and not before then, I burst into tears.

123
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,620
CHAPTER TWO
The Bloomfield Family

124
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:18,530
The journey was cold and long and it was one
o'clock in the afternoon when I arrived at

125
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,960
Wellwood House.

126
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,630
As the carriage moved through the large gates
and the impressive house and gardens came

127
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,140
into view, I began to feel very nervous.

128
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,070
There was no going back now.

129
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,510
How would I introduce myself?

130
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,180
What would my new life be like?

131
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,380
I hoped that Mrs Bloomfield was a kind, generous
woman and that I would get on well with the

132
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
children.

133
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:50,580
'Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,' I said
to myself as I entered the house and met Mrs

134
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,840
Bloomfield for the first time.

135
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,460
She was a tall, serious-looking woman, with
thick black hair, cold grey eyes and very

136
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,320
pale skin.

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,840
I was so nervous that I almost forgot to reply
when she introduced herself.

138
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,180
She showed me my bedroom and then told me
to come down for lunch in a few minutes.

139
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,000
With some difficulty, I found my way into
the dining room where some lunch had been

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,020
put out on a long table.

141
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,820
As I ate, she sat opposite me, watching me
and asking a few questions.

142
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:33,160
When she spoke, she spoke quite formally,
and most of the time I ate in silence.

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,340
When I had finished eating, she led me into
the sitting room.

144
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,370
She rang a bell and when a servant appeared,
she asked for the children to be brought to

145
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,680
meet me.

146
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:51,030
'I think they are clever children,' said Mrs
Bloomfield as we waited for them to arrive,

147
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:59,550
'and very keen to learn, especially the little
boy; he is generous and always tells the truth.'

148
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,660
I was pleased to hear this good news.

149
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,510
'His sister, Mary Ann,' she continued, 'is
generally a very good girl, but you will need

150
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,040
to watch her carefully.'

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,590
At that moment, my two young pupils came into
the room.

152
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:23,750
Master Tom Bloomfield was a handsome, tall
boy of about seven with fair hair, blue eyes

153
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,250
and a small turned up nose.

154
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,640
Mary Ann, who was a year or so younger than
her brother, was also a tall girl for her

155
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
age.

156
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,780
She was dark-haired like her mother, but with
a round face and pink cheeks.

157
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:46,600
We spent a few minutes talking and I saw that
they seemed to be very confident, lively children.

158
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,260
Mrs Bloomfield then suggested that Master
Tom should show me where I would teach them

159
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,870
and so he led the way to the schoolroom.

160
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,340
As soon as we were in the schoolroom, the
children began to argue with each other and

161
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,690
Tom pushed his sister roughly.

162
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:09,790
This was very shocking, but I hoped that in
time I would be able to change their behaviour.

163
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:16,690
Later that evening, after the children had
gone to bed, Mrs Bloomfield talked to me again.

164
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,120
She told me in great detail about her wonderful
children, what they must learn and how I should

165
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,240
manage them.

166
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,190
At about half-past nine, she invited me to
eat a supper of cold meat and bread.

167
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,180
I was glad when that was over and I was able
to return to my room.

168
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:40,420
Although I really wanted to like her, I could
not help feeling that she was cold, serious

169
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:46,040
and even a little frightening - the very opposite
of the kind, gentle woman I had hoped she

170
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,240
would be.

171
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,720
Despite the disappointments of the previous
day, I woke up the next morning feeling excited

172
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,820
and hopeful.

173
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,810
I was going to spend my first morning in the
schoolroom with the children.

174
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,450
However, the morning turned out to be full
of challenges.

175
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,880
Tom, although he seemed quite clever, was
very lazy.

176
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,030
Mary Ann could hardly read at all and kept
looking out of the window, or walking away.

177
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,320
We had made very little progress by the end
of the lesson.

178
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,890
'Now you must put on your coat,' Tom told
me, 'I want to show you the garden.'

179
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,230
'I'm not sure that's a good idea,' I told
him.

180
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,600
'It looks like it's going to rain and...'

181
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,960
'That doesn't matter,' he interrupted.

182
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,800
'You have to come with us.

183
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,360
And I won't allow any excuses,' he added rudely.

184
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,760
It was our first day together and I did not
want to get into an argument, so I agreed

185
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,410
to go with the children.

186
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,870
The garden was large and beautiful, but I
was not allowed any time to admire it.

187
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,770
Instead, I was taken to a distant corner of
the garden.

188
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:12,360
There Tom showed me different traps he had
made to catch birds and other small animals.

189
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,260
He proudly told me how he liked to cut the
birds up with a knife, or pull off their wings.

190
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,040
'Don't you know it is extremely wicked to
do those things to animals?'

191
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,520
I cried, shocked by what he had told me.

192
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,850
'Oh, what nonsense!' he replied.

193
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,610
'Father knows what I do to them and he says
it's just what he used to do when he was a

194
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,850
boy.'

195
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,370
'Well, I still think it is wrong,' I told
him.

196
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,760
'And you will certainly not hurt any animals
as long as I have the power to prevent it.'

197
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,980
Next, they took me to a pond - a small area
of water - in the corner of the garden.

198
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,690
Mary Ann started to throw stones into the
water.

199
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,300
The children's clothes became wet and dirty
and I told them to come away from the pond.

200
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,930
But I had no control over them - they did
exactly what they wanted to and ignored what

201
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,710
I said to them.

202
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,410
After a few minutes of trying to persuade
them to leave the pond, I suddenly saw a man

203
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,030
riding a horse towards us.

204
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,200
He shouted loudly to the children, 'Get out
of that water!'

205
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,420
then he came towards me.

206
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,470
'I suppose you are Miss Grey,' he said coldly.

207
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,740
'I am surprised that you are allowing them
to get their clothes dirty like this.

208
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,390
Can't you see that Miss Bloomfield has dirt
on her dress?

209
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,090
And that Master Bloomfield's socks are wet?

210
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,260
I request that in future, you at least keep
their clothes clean!'

211
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,600
Then he turned and continued his ride up to
the house.

212
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,090
This must be Mr Bloomfield!'

213
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:08,029
I was surprised that he had called his young
children 'Miss' and 'Master' and I was shocked

214
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,060
that he had not spoken to me in a more polite
way.

215
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:18,120
When the children and I were called into the
dining room for lunch, I saw him again.

216
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,350
He was quite a short man and was rather thin.

217
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,440
He was between thirty and forty years of age:
he had a large mouth, pale skin, dull blue

218
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,670
eyes, and the sort of hair, which is neither
fair nor brown.

219
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,740
During lunch, he complained about the food,
said the kitchen servants were lazy and told

220
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,920
his wife that she was not even capable of
organizing a meal.

221
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,410
'Perhaps, Mr Bloomfield, you will order lunch
yourself in future,' she told him, angrily.

222
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,500
Nothing more was said and I was very glad
to leave the room with the children.

223
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:03,470
I was not used to hearing people talk to each
other in this way; I had never felt so embarrassed

224
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,970
and uncomfortable in my life.

225
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:12,650
In the afternoon, I tried to teach Tom and
Mary Ann once more, then they took me outside

226
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,360
again, then we ate supper together in the
schoolroom.

227
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,480
Much later, when they had gone down to see
their parents, I had some time to myself at

228
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
last.

229
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,930
I sat down and started to write a letter to
my lovely family, but the children came back

230
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,580
upstairs before I had finished it.

231
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,990
At seven o'clock, I had to put Mary Ann to
bed and then I played with Tom until he went

232
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,640
to bed at eight.

233
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,490
Then I finished my letter and spent some time
hanging up my clothes, something I had not

234
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,930
yet managed to do.

235
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:52,430
Finally, I got into bed and because I was
so tired, I fell asleep in just a few minutes.

236
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,730
I did not know it at the time, but this had
been a good day compared to many of the days

237
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:15,030
that would follow.

238
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,150
CHAPTER THREE
The Bird's Nest

239
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,110
Teaching and looking after the children became
harder, rather than easier, as I got to know

240
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,110
them.

241
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,810
Master Tom not only refused to be controlled,
but tried to control me and his sister.

242
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,250
He often refused to do his lessons.

243
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,880
Sometimes I had to sit with my chair against
the door in order to keep him in the schoolroom.

244
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,400
At last, after trying to push me out of the
way, and making faces at me, he would finally

245
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,930
do his work.

246
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,090
Tom, however, was not as bad a pupil as Mary
Ann.

247
00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:00,059
If I asked her to read a book or do some writing,
she would drop to the floor and yell loudly.

248
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:04,870
She was too heavy for me to pick up, and so
she would lie there until the lunch bell meant

249
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,830
that she could escape.

250
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,880
Then she would jump up with a big smile on
her face.

251
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,970
She knew she had won.

252
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,990
The children's behaviour meant that it was
almost impossible to get them to the dining

253
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,400
room at the right time, or make sure they
were dressed correctly.

254
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,300
Mrs Bloomfield would then give me black looks
and Mr Bloomfield would make disparaging comments

255
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,400
about me to his wife while I was in the room.

256
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,900
This upset me.

257
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,090
I had tried everything I could think of to
teach and control the children.

258
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,750
In desperation, I decided that I should focus
on two very important things in order to change

259
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,280
their behaviour.

260
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,920
I had to be patient and I had to be strict.

261
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,530
So I focused on doing this with all of my
strength over the coming weeks.

262
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,150
However, it did not matter how hard I tried.

263
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,580
Their behaviour did not get better.

264
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,690
I will never forget one cold, snowy January
afternoon.

265
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,660
The children had come into the schoolroom,
shouting that they planned 'to be naughty,'

266
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,130
and they had done exactly that.

267
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,040
While I was holding Tom down on his chair
and making him do his work, Mary Ann took

268
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,480
my workbag and started to look at what was
inside it.

269
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,740
When she saw that it only contained my work
papers and books, she threw it into the fire!

270
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,130
Letting Tom go, I ran to the other side of
the room and pulled the bag out of the fire.

271
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:42,919
Then Tom jumped up from his chair and yelled,
'Let's throw her desk out of the window!'

272
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,030
He grabbed my desk, which contained my letters
and the little money I owned.

273
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,170
I quickly went to rescue it.

274
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,130
Both children then ran away from me, out of
the house and into the snow, where they rolled

275
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,190
about, shouting with happiness.

276
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,130
I stood in shock, watching them.

277
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,070
While I was wondering what to do next, I heard
a voice behind me.

278
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,920
'What on earth are the children doing?'

279
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,580
It was Mr Bloomfield.

280
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,380
'I can't get them to come inside, sir,' I
said, turning round.

281
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:23,240
'Come in now, you dirty brats; or I'll hit
both of you!' he yelled.

282
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,050
The children ran into the house.

283
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,910
'There, you see!

284
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,400
They come at the first word!' he commented.

285
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,830
'Yes, when you tell them what to do, sir,'
I told him.

286
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,761
'And it's very strange that you don't seem
to be able to control them, isn't it?' he

287
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:40,761
said.

288
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:43,040
'You're meant to be their governess.'

289
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,470
It was true: I could not control them.

290
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,270
At least not without hitting them or saying
that, I was going to hit them, which was what

291
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,370
their father did.

292
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:58,300
But I felt sure that hurting them was not
the right thing to do.

293
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,350
Later that evening, just before I entered
the dining room, I heard Mr Bloomfield telling

294
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,170
his wife about the afternoon's events.

295
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,220
'Goodness!'

296
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,010
I heard Mrs Bloomfield say, 'Do you really
think the children are safe with her?

297
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,900
I'm beginning to wonder...'

298
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,570
I heard no more, but that was enough.

299
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,150
From that day forward, Mr Bloomfield would
often come and check on the children while

300
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,460
we were in the schoolroom or in the garden.

301
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,020
Of course, Tom and Mary Ann were always doing
something they should not be doing.

302
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,840
If I was quiet at the moment Mr Bloomfield
appeared, he said that I was not doing enough

303
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,970
to control them; if I was telling them off,
he complained that I was being too strict.

304
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,370
I could not win.

305
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:52,530
One day in May, Tom came out of the bushes
in the garden carrying a nest of young birds,

306
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,040
with Mary Ann running behind him.

307
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:01,220
He put the nest on the ground and stood over
it with his legs wide apart, his hands pushed

308
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,910
into the pockets of his trousers.

309
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,540
'You're not having any of the chicks, Mary
Ann!

310
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:13,110
They are all mine and I'm going to take them
out and pull their legs off!'

311
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,110
Tom cried.

312
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,650
'But, Tom,' I said calmly, 'I will not allow
you to hurt birds.

313
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,670
The nest must be carried back to the place
you took it from.'

314
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,700
'No!

315
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,059
I won't move from here!

316
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:31,679
And I won't tell you where we found them!'
he replied,

317
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,990
'Then if you don't change your mind and tell
me,' I replied, 'I will carry them back into

318
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,410
the bushes and leave them there, even though
their mother may not find them.'

319
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,260
When Tom still refused to return the birds,
I decided that I must do what I had said I

320
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
would do.

321
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,650
I picked up the nest and walked quickly into
the bushes and trees nearby.

322
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:03,140
Luckily, Tom did not attempt to follow me,
but starting yelling loudly instead.

323
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:10,790
I walked until I was far away from the main
garden, then I pushed the nest into a bush.

324
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:16,630
When I returned to the garden, I saw that
Mr Bloomfield had appeared and Tom had begun

325
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,910
to angrily tell him what I had done.

326
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,340
Mary Ann stood nearby, crying.

327
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:28,240
'I see,' said Mr Bloomfield, when Tom had
finished his story.

328
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,641
'Never mind, Tom, I'll find you some more
chicks tomorrow and you can do what you want

329
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,000
with them.'

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,590
Feeling anger rising up inside me, I turned
to Mr Bloomfield and told him, 'And if Master

331
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,920
Bloomfield tries to hurt them, then I will
feel it is my duty to take those away from

332
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,250
him, too.'

333
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:55,320
'Will you?' he said and then he looked at
me for a long moment before walking away with

334
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,340
the children towards the house.

335
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,480
When I reached the house myself, it was clear
that Tom had told his mother about the nest.

336
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,090
'I am sorry, Miss Grey, that you stopped Master
Bloomfield from enjoying himself,' she said

337
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,090
coldly.

338
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:18,221
'When Master Bloomfield's enjoyment involves
injuring animals,' I answered, 'I think it

339
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:20,220
is my duty to stop it.

340
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,740
I believe that it is wrong to hurt animals
for our enjoyment.'

341
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,429
'But I don't think,' she said, becoming impatient,
'that a tiny animal is more important than

342
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,750
my son's enjoyment.

343
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,750
Do you?'

344
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:38,429
I took a breath and thought carefully before
I spoke.

345
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:45,130
'For the child's own education, he should
be taught to be respectful and kind,' I answered,

346
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,800
as politely as I could.

347
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
'Oh!

348
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,180
Of course!'

349
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:56,080
she replied, 'But respect and kindness are
for people, not animals.

350
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,450
And I do not think that you have shown much
respect and kindness to my son by taking away

351
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,790
something he had spent a long time looking
for.'

352
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,270
I decided it was best to say nothing more.

353
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,230
This was the nearest I had come to having
an argument with Mrs Bloomfield.

354
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,970
It was also one of the longest conversations
I had ever shared with her.

355
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,860
Not long after this Mrs Bloomfield told me
that after the summer I would be no longer

356
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,210
needed.

357
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,200
She explained that while my general behaviour
had been acceptable, she and Mr Bloomfield

358
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,010
felt that the children had made very little
progress since my arrival.

359
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,450
Although the children were more intelligent
than most children of a similar age, she told

360
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:46,430
me, their school work was a disappointment
and they were not well behaved.

361
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,620
She believed that this was because I had not
been patient and strict enough with them.

362
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:58,080
But these were exactly the things that I had
been focusing on with all my strength!

363
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,830
I wanted to tell her how hard I had been trying,
but I began to feel upset.

364
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,200
I was worried that I would start to cry.

365
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,600
So I said nothing and that is how I was dismissed
from my first job.

366
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,950
What would my family think of me?

367
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,180
After everything, I had told them, I had not
been able to keep my job as a governess.

368
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:27,320
However, as upset and disappointed as I was,
I knew that all parents were not like Mr and

369
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,179
Mrs Bloomfield, and all children were not
like theirs.

370
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:37,170
Surely, the next family would be different,
and any change must be for the better.

371
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,720
There was no doubt that I had learnt a lot
at Wellwood House.

372
00:27:41,720 --> 00:28:02,480
I felt confident that I could be more successful
with a new employer.

373
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,660
CHAPTER FOUR
Horton Lodge

374
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,710
I returned to my parents' house and for a
few months, I enjoyed a much more relaxing

375
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,260
life at home.

376
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,830
However, it was not long before I was ready
to look for another job.

377
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,930
After a few weeks of searching, I was offered
a job as a governess for the family of Mr

378
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,930
Murray.

379
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:30,080
The family lived at Horton Lodge, which was
a large house about seventy miles away from

380
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
our village.

381
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,280
I had never travelled further than twenty
miles from home before, so I was excited by

382
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,850
the idea of seeing a little more of the world.

383
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,690
The Murray children were a little older than
those of the Bloomfield family and so I hoped

384
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,330
that teaching them would be less challenging.

385
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:54,490
In addition, my salary was going to be fifty
pounds a year so I felt sure that I would

386
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,309
be able to send a good amount of money back
home to help my family.

387
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,680
It was decided that I would start my new job
at the end of January.

388
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,080
When at last the morning came, it was a wild,
stormy day and it was snowing heavily.

389
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,380
My journey was long and difficult and it was
dark when I finally arrived at the impressive

390
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,110
front door of Horton Lodge.

391
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,600
A servant invited me inside and took me straight
to the schoolroom, which was at the back of

392
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,920
the house.

393
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,940
There, two young ladies were sitting by the
fire.

394
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,260
I supposed that they must be my new pupils.

395
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:38,690
After we had been formally introduced, the
older of the two girls spoke.

396
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,700
'Miss Matilda, why don't you show the new
governess her room?

397
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,380
I'm sure she is cold and tired after her journey,'
she said to the other girl.

398
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,100
Miss Matilda was a strong-looking girl of
about fourteen.

399
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,150
She stood up and, a little shyly, asked me
to follow her.

400
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,990
She took me to a room at the very top of the
house.

401
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:07,320
Although small, the room was comfortable enough
and I was pleased to be able to take off my

402
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:15,510
wet coat, Matilda left me alone to organise
my things and change into dry clothes.

403
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,100
A few minutes later, the maid brought me some
tea and bread.

404
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,820
Feeling a little sad and lonely, I then sat
down on the bed and cried.

405
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:33,380
The next morning I woke up feeling nervous,
but also curious to know what my new life

406
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,200
would be like in this house, I went down to
the school room to begin what would be the

407
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,800
first day of two years of teaching the girls.

408
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:48,010
I do not want to bore you with all the details
of the first year or two with this family.

409
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,340
I will simply describe the family and give
you a general idea of this time.

410
00:30:52,340 --> 00:31:01,120
The head of the family, Mr Murray, was a tall,
well-built man who I did not see very often.

411
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,410
Apart from going to church on Sundays, he
spent his time horse-riding, fox-hunting,

412
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,760
laughing loudly and yelling at the servants.

413
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,910
Mrs Murray was not an unattractive lady.

414
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,410
She was about forty years of age and she certainly
enjoyed her food.

415
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:26,010
Her main interests seemed to be either holding
or going to parties and wearing the very latest

416
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,470
fashions.

417
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,900
When I met her for the first time, which was
not until half way through my first day, she

418
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,120
told me what my duties were going to be.

419
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,860
'And remember,' she said after she had explained
the importance of good manners and not working

420
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,120
the girls too hard, 'that it is best to be
gentle with them,' While Mrs Murray talked

421
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,630
a lot about the comfort and happiness of her
children, she never once talked about my comfort

422
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,720
and happiness.

423
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,860
The eldest daughter, Miss Rosalie Murray,
was about sixteen years old.

424
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,620
She was tall and slim with pale blue eyes
and long fair hair.

425
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,480
She really was a very beautiful girl.

426
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,820
If only I could say such good things about
her character!

427
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,210
To begin with, she was cold and unfriendly.

428
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:25,130
And, rather like her mother, she was generally
only interested in how she looked and in the

429
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,559
idea that she might in the future marry someone
rich.

430
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:36,250
The fourth person, in the family, Miss Matilda,
was a tomboy and was very different from her

431
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,250
sister.

432
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,100
She did not care how she looked and was much
more interested in riding her pony or playing

433
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,080
with the family's dogs.

434
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,610
She was not a good student.

435
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,740
She often did her schoolwork too quickly,
made little effort and would run outside as

436
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,030
soon as she saw the chance.

437
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,690
Once or twice, I told her off for not making
any effort.

438
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:03,740
However, her mother became so angry with me
that I decided that it was best to allow Matilda

439
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,660
to do as little as she always had.

440
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,679
You may want to know how I spent a typical
day at Horton Lodge.

441
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,710
This is not easy to describe.

442
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:21,799
I ate all of my meals in the schoolroom with
my pupils, at whatever times suited them each

443
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,799
day.

444
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,990
Their hours of study were managed in a similar
way.

445
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,150
Sometimes the girls decided that they wanted
to get all of their studying finished before

446
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,020
breakfast and I would be woken up by the maid
at half-past five in the morning.

447
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:42,140
On one of these occasions, I ran downstairs
and waited, only to be told that they had

448
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,060
changed their minds and had stayed in bed.

449
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,470
On other days, they would simply decide that
it was a sunny day and they did not want to

450
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,760
study at all.

451
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,120
When they were in the schoolroom, they were
lazy and often rude.

452
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,740
The servants, who saw how the parents and
children of the family showed me so little

453
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,970
respect, did not make much more of an effort
themselves.

454
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,530
I sometimes felt disappointed and upset by
the life I led at Horton Lodge.

455
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:18,510
But, with time and patience, things did get
a little better.

456
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,730
Rosalie became a little more friendly.

457
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,650
When she was not, being difficult, she could
be fun and pleasant to be with and I grew

458
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,530
to like her.

459
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:33,570
Sometimes, when she forgot for a moment that
I was the daughter of a poor vicar, I think

460
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,540
she may even have loved and respected me.

461
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,210
What is more, the house was attractive and
spacious and was better in every way than

462
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,970
Mr Bloomfield's house.

463
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:50,270
It had a large garden and was in beautiful
countryside.

464
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:55,109
Every Sunday morning the whole family and
I would leave the house and go out in the

465
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,200
carriage.

466
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,380
We travelled through this beautiful scenery
and along the two miles of country roads to

467
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:19,570
the village church.

468
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,130
CHAPTER FIVE
The Ball

469
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,560
Not long after Rosalie's eighteenth birthday,
the time came for her to be formally introduced

470
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
to society.

471
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,200
She had now finished her education and was
old enough to look for a husband.

472
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,480
Mrs Murray was clearly very excited about
this fact and had decided to hold a ball for

473
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,320
her daughter at Horton Lodge.

474
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:50,369
It was going to be held on 3rd January and
all the rich people (and especially the men)

475
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:53,390
for twenty miles around were invited.

476
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,460
Months of preparation began.

477
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,010
One evening, about a month before the ball,
I was sitting reading a long letter from my

478
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,110
sister, Mary.

479
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,480
Rosalie came into the room and said, 'Miss
Grey, put that boring letter away because

480
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,820
I want to talk to you about my ball.

481
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,550
I don't want you to go home over Christmas.

482
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,070
You must stay here and help me plan!'

483
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:24,400
'But I'm afraid I can't stay,' I replied,
'I very much miss my family, and this letter

484
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,370
that you call "boring" tells me that my sister
is going to get married.

485
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,880
I want to be at home with her to help her
prepare.'

486
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,280
'Oh!' cried Rosalie.

487
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,060
'Who is she going to marry?'

488
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:43,510
'Mr Richardson, a vicar who lives just a few
miles away,' I explained.

489
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,700
'Is he rich?'

490
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,310
she wanted to know.

491
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,260
'No, not really,' I said.

492
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,290
'Is he handsome?'

493
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,290
she asked.

494
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,980
'Not really,' I told her.

495
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,450
'Then what sort of a house does he own?'

496
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,531
'A quiet little vicarage,' I said, 'with a
small old-fashioned garden and -'

497
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:06,590
'Oh stop!

498
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:13,610
I don't want to hear any more,' she cried,
'How on earth can she live there?'

499
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:20,280
'I expect that she'll not only manage to live
there, but will be very happy,' I told her,

500
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,369
'You did not ask me if he is a good, kind
or wise man.

501
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,600
I could have answered yes to all those things.'

502
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,440
From this conversation, alone it was clear
to see what Rosalie considered important,

503
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,920
and the type of man she wished to marry.

504
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,869
When I returned to Horton Lodge after the
Christmas holidays, Rosalie and Matilda began

505
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:47,390
to argue about who should tell me their news
first.

506
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:53,061
Rosalie, of course, could not wait to tell
me about the ball, Matilda was not in the

507
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:58,470
least interested in hearing about her sister's
party, but wanted to tell me about her new

508
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,160
pony.

509
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,910
Matilda had the loudest voice and so it was
she who won the argument.

510
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:11,770
After hearing everything about the pony, including
how high it had jumped and how well Matilda

511
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,610
rode it, I heard every detail of the ball
from Rosalie.

512
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:22,830
Of all the women at the party, she had worn
the most beautiful dress, she had danced the

513
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,680
most elegantly and she had attracted the most
attention.

514
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:33,400
I could only take her word for how the evening
had gone, but one thing seemed clear to me.

515
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,150
She had certainly flirted with almost all
of the men who had been invited.

516
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:45,190
She told me about two lords (who unfortunately
were already married) and there was Sir Thomas

517
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,400
Ashby (who was very rich, but ugly).

518
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,270
Then there was Sir Meltham (who was good-looking,
but too old) and the younger of his two sons,

519
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,040
Harry Meltham (who was good-looking, but too
young).

520
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,440
There were a few I had not heard of before
and then finally there was Mr Hatfield, the

521
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,550
local vicar.

522
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,080
While he was not impressively rich or from
a well-known family, Rosalie seemed to find

523
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,560
him acceptable, perhaps because he had been
chosen for his job by God himself.

524
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,800
'And which of them do you like the best?'

525
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,620
I asked her once she had finished naming them
all.

526
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,940
'Oh, I hate them all,' Rosalie replied coldly.

527
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,820
'But old Sir Meltham is the most handsome
and the funniest, Mr Hatfield is the most

528
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,230
intelligent and interesting and Sir Thomas
the most wicked.

529
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,650
If I had to choose one of them, I suppose
I would have to choose Sir Thomas Ashby.'

530
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,170
'But why would you choose him if you hate
him and he is wicked?'

531
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,690
I asked her.

532
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,599
'Oh, I don't mind his being wicked - that
would make him more fun,' she explained.

533
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:05,560
'And as for hating him, that doesn't really
matter, because I would be Lady Ashby of Ashby

534
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,650
Park, in that wonderful house!

535
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:12,360
But the truth is that I would much rather
remain single because I want to really enjoy

536
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
myself.

537
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,460
I would love to spend years and years flirting
with anyone I want to.

538
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,520
Then, when I've broken ten thousand hearts,
I will stop.

539
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,763
I will find one man who is rich, generous
and from an excellent family.

540
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:32,330
And I will escape all the black looks that
I will be getting from people by marrying

541
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:48,560
him.'

542
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,010
CHAPTER SIX
The New Curate

543
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:57,970
The next Sunday, I accompanied the whole family
to church as usual.

544
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,980
Rosalie was very keen to go as she had heard
that there was a new curate.

545
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,560
As we left the church later that morning she
said, 'Well, Miss Grey.

546
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,470
What did you think of the new curate - Mr
Edward Weston?'

547
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:19,570
'It is hard to say,' I replied, 'since I have
seen him, but I haven't yet spoken to him.'

548
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,869
'Well, no.

549
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:24,130
But aren't his clothes old-fashioned?

550
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,310
And isn't he ugly?'

551
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,310
she asked.

552
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:32,330
'No, he didn't seem unattractive to me,' I
replied.

553
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:38,290
I thought for a moment and then added, 'and
when he read to us from the Bible, I thought

554
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,090
that he read very well.

555
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,869
He seemed more interesting and more sincere
than Mr Hatfield.'

556
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,770
'Well, anyone can read from the Bible, can't
they?

557
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,320
But did you see how he walked out of the church?'

558
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
she said.

559
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,660
'He walked along, not looking left or right,
as if there was nobody there apart from himself!'

560
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,599
'Ah, I see,' I said and smiled.

561
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:07,770
'You mean to say that he made no effort to
look at you, or come and speak to you.'

562
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,790
'Well,' she said and gave me a black look,
'I suppose he's good enough for this place.

563
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:19,760
But have you seen how Mr Hatfield comes straight
to speak to father and me before anyone else?

564
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,510
And he always makes sure that he's waiting
outside to help me climb into the carriage.'

565
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,290
'Yes,' I answered.

566
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:32,730
Then I silently thought that it was not good
that the vicar had ignored everyone else in

567
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,570
the church to go to speak to the Murray family
so quickly.

568
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,930
I was also offended that he had helped the
ladies to get into the carriage and then had

569
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,420
closed the door and walked away.

570
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,520
He had left me to open the door again and
climb up by myself.

571
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,460
The following Sunday we went to church as
usual.

572
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,100
This time we heard Mr Weston preach the sermon.

573
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,810
I thought that his sermon was well written
and he preached it in a warm and simple way.

574
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,390
I was pleased that it was the opposite of
Mr Hatfield's sermons, which were usually

575
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,040
boring and full of self-importance.

576
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,869
When we left the church this time, it was
young Harry Meltham who quickly came to talk

577
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:18,080
to the girls and to help them get into the
carriage.

578
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,530
He did not help me, but at least he looked
at me and smiled as I climbed in.

579
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,980
I then spent the whole of the return journey
listening to Rosalie and Matilda argue over

580
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,580
which of the two of them Mr Meltham preferred.

581
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,490
My life was easier now that I now only had
one pupil and I therefore did not have to

582
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,800
suffer the girls' arguments so frequently.

583
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,760
It also meant that I had a little more free
time to look around the family's estate.

584
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,880
On several occasions, I had gone with my pupils
to visit the poor workers who lived in the

585
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,940
estate cottages.

586
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,820
We had taken them food, medicines and a little
money.

587
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,650
I had become friendly with one or two of the
cottagers and now I started to visit them

588
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,990
on my own.

589
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,430
On one bright day near the end of February,
I went to one of the cottages to see Nancy

590
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:15,270
Brown, a widow - a woman whose husband had
died - who had been ill and could not see

591
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:16,570
very well.

592
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,270
She loved books and so I went to read to her.

593
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,550
The cottage was small and dark, but Nancy
had a small fire burning and she kept the

594
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,060
place as clean and as tidy as she could.

595
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,640
When I had finished reading to her, she spoke
to me.

596
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,810
'Miss Grey, what do you think of Mr Weston,
the new curate?'

597
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:46,300
'I don't know,' I replied, a little surprised
by the suddenness of the question, 'I think

598
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,560
he preaches very well.'

599
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,830
'Yes, he does.

600
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,710
And he talks well too!'

601
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,710
she added.

602
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,710
'Oh, does he?

603
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,640
I haven't had a chance to speak to him yet,'
I explained.

604
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,140
'He's such a patient, thoughtful and generous
man,' she said, smiling.

605
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,200
'He comes to see me a lot more than Mr Hatfield
used to.

606
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,140
Mr Hatfield just used to come to tell me that
I had to go to church.

607
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,750
Once when he came he kicked my cat.

608
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:29,300
But Mr Weston... he reads to me, and sits
and listens to my troubles and talks to me

609
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,080
with kind words.

610
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,800
And he even lets my cat sit on him!'

611
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,280
'And how often does he come?'

612
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,750
I wanted to know.

613
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:47,540
'Oh, every few days,' she said and then went
on, 'and he goes to see all the other sick

614
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,580
cottagers, too.

615
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:56,260
I heard that he spent his own money on coal
for one family and took food to another.'

616
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,300
I was surprised and pleased to hear this news.

617
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:05,130
I knew that Mr Hatfield, the vicar, rarely
came to the cottages and was not interested

618
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,660
in the cottagers' needs.

619
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,730
But Mr Weston...

620
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,990
well, he really did seem like a breath of
fresh air.

621
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,390
For two years, I had been with silly girls
and people who thought that parties and marriage

622
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,450
were the only important things in life.

623
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:24,190
At last, someone had arrived in the village
who would rather spend his money on helping

624
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,460
others, than on buying the latest fashions.

625
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:45,960
I very much hoped that I would soon be able
to talk to him myself.

626
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,000
CHAPTER SEVEN
Chance Meetings

627
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,470
When we were in church the following Sunday
I looked at Mr Weston in a different light.

628
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:00,990
He was quite a short man, with brown hair
and a square face.

629
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,900
He was not handsome, but he was not, in my
opinion, ugly either.

630
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,830
When I had first heard him preach, I thought
that he was intelligent and sensible but also

631
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,970
quite serious.

632
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:20,859
Now I knew that he was also truly generous,
gentle and caring and this made him seem more

633
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:23,380
attractive to me as a result.

634
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,859
I started to look forward to seeing him every
Sunday at church.

635
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,070
A few weeks later, I went to see Nancy again.

636
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:35,740
I stayed with her a little longer than usual
because her cat had been missing for a couple

637
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,740
of days.

638
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:43,300
I tried to tell her that the cat would surely
return and that it was probably just out hunting,

639
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,730
but Nancy was sad and worried.

640
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:52,020
However, just as I was about to leave there
was a knock at the door.

641
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:59,480
The door then opened and in walked Mr Weston,
who was smiling and carrying Nancy's cat!

642
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:06,180
'Here you are, Nancy,' he said warmly and
gave the cat to her, 'I told you I would find

643
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,190
him.'

644
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:12,670
Then he smiled at me and said, 'I do hope
that you are not planning to leave now, Miss

645
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,670
Grey.

646
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,050
I'm afraid that it has just started to rain.'

647
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:22,349
Before I could speak, Nancy had pulled another
chair near the fire and said, 'You must both

648
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,640
stay here by the fire until the rain has stopped.

649
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,359
There's plenty of room for us all.'

650
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:37,390
We sat together as Nancy thanked Mr Weston
several times, and Mr Weston explained how

651
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,460
he had found the cat.

652
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,410
After a few minutes of conversation, Mr Weston
said that he was very pleased to have returned

653
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,180
the cat, but that he must now go and visit
another neighbour.

654
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,220
He politely said goodbye and then left.

655
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,840
I had very much enjoyed my visit to Nancy's
cottage despite, or perhaps because of, the

656
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,920
rain.

657
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,310
Rosalie was now so keen to flirt with as many
men as possible that she usually went to church

658
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:11,030
twice on a Sunday, Happily for me, I was always
expected to accompany her.

659
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:16,460
Often, if the weather was good, both she and
her sister would walk home instead of taking

660
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,270
the carriage.

661
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,460
Rosalie preferred to do this, as there was
always the chance that a man would offer to

662
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,329
walk some of the way home with her.

663
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:31,030
On one sunny day near the end of March, I
accompanied the girls, and three of their

664
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,310
admirers, on one of their walks back from
church.

665
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:39,680
I felt uncomfortable on these walks - I did
not want to walk next to them and be ignored

666
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,970
by them, but neither did I want to walk behind
them like a lonely servant.

667
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:50,540
Instead, I pretended to study flowers at the
side of the road so that I had an excuse to

668
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,800
walk behind them on my own.

669
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,980
As I was walking, I saw some yellow primroses
growing high on the top of a bank that was

670
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,369
covered in grass.

671
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:06,579
These small, beautiful flowers reminded me
of my garden at home, where lots of these

672
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,359
flowers grew each spring.

673
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:11,140
I wanted to pick some of the flowers to take
with me.

674
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:17,330
I started to climb the bank, but found that
it was too difficult for me to climb easily.

675
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:24,310
At that moment, I heard someone walking behind
me, and a warm, well-known voice suddenly

676
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,190
said, 'Allow me to pick them for you, Miss
Grey.'

677
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,520
Within a few moments, the flowers had been
picked and were in my hand.

678
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,270
It was Mr Weston, of course!

679
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:43,770
Who else would make the effort to do something
so thoughtful for me, an unimportant governess?

680
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:49,109
I was not used to anyone in the village being
so kind to me and I felt very grateful.

681
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:55,440
I thanked him nervously and began to walk
down the country road towards Rosalie, Matilda

682
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,920
and their group.

683
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,960
'Your young ladies have left you alone,' he
commented as he began to walk next to me.

684
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,829
'Yes, they are busy with more interesting
people,' I replied.

685
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:11,510
'Then slow down a little.

686
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,890
If I were you I wouldn't go so quickly to
catch them up,' he said and smiled.

687
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:23,349
For a few moments, we walked in silence and
I could not think of anything to say to him.

688
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:27,640
Then he spoke and asked me if I especially
liked primroses.

689
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,660
'Oh, yes.

690
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:36,460
I love them,' I said, 'I miss my family so
much and primroses remind me of home.'

691
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:42,780
'How lucky you are, Miss Grey, to have a home
that you love and know that you can return

692
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,980
to,' he told me.

693
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,630
'Yes,' I agreed.

694
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:51,780
'It gives me so much comfort that I don't
think I could live without it.'

695
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,740
'I'm sure you could,' he said thoughtfully.

696
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,930
'The human heart is much stronger than we
might think.

697
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:05,650
You might be miserable if you lost your home,
but you would survive and you would be all

698
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:06,650
right.'

699
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:13,540
He was quiet for a moment before continuing
quietly, 'Take my word for it because I speak

700
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,720
from experience.

701
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,280
There was a time when I, like you, believed
that a home and family were the only things

702
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,440
that made life bearable.

703
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,210
But both of my parents have now died and I
no longer have a home.

704
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,050
All I have are two rented rooms in this village.

705
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:35,100
And yet not only have I survived, but I still
have hope.'

706
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:41,369
'And you don't know what happiness there may
be in the future for you,' I said quickly,

707
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:43,200
'you are still young.'

708
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,230
'I am already very happy,' he replied, 'because
I know that I can be useful and help people

709
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,150
who are less fortunate than me.'

710
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,060
When the walk was finished, I could not stop
thinking about Mr Weston.

711
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,170
He seemed such a sensitive, caring, thoughtful
man.

712
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:09,550
I felt very sorry for him because he had no
mother, no father and no real home.

713
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,680
Perhaps this was the reason why he often looked
so serious.

714
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,870
But I also thought that, over the months,
he would surely make friends in the village.

715
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:24,690
If he wanted to he could make a home for himself
and in time, he might meet a woman.

716
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:30,109
Someone as honest and as good as him, who
he could many and share his new home with.

717
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:35,570
What a happy life they could lead together
and how lucky that woman would be...

718
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:42,109
I put the primroses in some water in my room
and looked at them every day.

719
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:46,840
When they finally began to die, I took one
of them and placed it between the pages of

720
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,950
a large book so that it would dry.

721
00:53:49,950 --> 00:54:10,510
I still have that dried flower today, and
I plan to keep it forever.

722
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:15,430
CHAPTER EIGHT
Mr Hatfield

723
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,740
The following day was as sunny as the previous
one.

724
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:24,070
I spent the first part of the morning trying
to teach Matilda, who was in a terrible mood

725
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:27,940
because she wanted to go outside and ride
her pony.

726
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,970
After just a couple of hours, she gave up
and said that she was going to play with the

727
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,500
dogs.

728
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,730
When she had left, I started to draw.

729
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:41,342
Rosalie had gone out that morning to enjoy
a quiet walk and to sit and read her book

730
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:43,220
in the fields.

731
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:48,160
She had told me to finish a drawing that she
herself had started several days earlier.

732
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,470
At my feet lay a small dog with rough hair.

733
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:57,960
The dog belonged to Matilda, but she hated
the animal and said that it was not well behaved.

734
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,290
It really was quite a good dog, but she said
that it was not even clever enough to know

735
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,760
who its owner was.

736
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,191
The truth was that to begin with, she had
played with the dog all the time, but she

737
00:55:10,191 --> 00:55:12,920
had soon got tired of having to look after
it.

738
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,200
Then, of course, the job became mine.

739
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,260
Because I was the person who gave Snap food
and took him for walks, he grew to love me.

740
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,670
I became very fond of him too.

741
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:30,530
Matilda, seeing that the dog preferred to
be with me than with her, decided she did

742
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,359
not like him and often said that she might
sell him.

743
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:40,230
While I was sitting like this trying to finish
Rosalie's drawing, Mrs Murray suddenly came

744
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,740
into the room.

745
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:48,589
'Miss Grey,' she began, 'How on earth can
you sit inside drawing on such a wonderful

746
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:50,520
day as this?'

747
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,220
Of course, I would not have been doing this
for my own pleasure, but Mrs Murray did not

748
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,220
understand that.

749
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,849
'Why don't you go outside with the young ladies?'

750
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:01,849
she added.

751
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:09,470
'I think, Madam,' I replied, 'that Miss Murray
is out reading somewhere and Miss Matilda

752
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,920
is spending time with the dogs.'

753
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,600
'Well, I think if Matilda spent more time
here, in the classroom with you, she wouldn't

754
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,730
need to spend so much time with those silly
dogs!'

755
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:21,730
she said.

756
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,580
'And if you were a little more cheerful and
friendly towards Rosalie, then perhaps she

757
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,980
wouldn't spend so much time walking around
the fields with a book in her hand,' she added.

758
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:38,310
Then, after a pause, 'And why does she like
to be on her own so much?'

759
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:44,120
'She says that she likes to be alone when
she has a new book to read,' I explained.

760
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,910
'But why can't she read it in the garden?

761
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,140
Why should she go into the fields?

762
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:53,990
And why does she so often seem to bump into
Mr Hatfield when she is out?'

763
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,380
Mrs Murray was full of questions now.

764
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:02,200
'And I'm sure I've just seen him from my window,
this very minute, walking very quickly in

765
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,150
the direction of that field where she often
sits!'

766
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,150
she cried.

767
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:10,280
'You should know exactly where she is at all
times.

768
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,590
Please go and see if she is there,' she continued.

769
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:18,550
'It is not right for a young lady to be walking
alone like that.

770
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,339
Any man at all could approach her and talk
to her!

771
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:24,220
And she is often far too friendly with them.'

772
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:31,320
As Mrs Murray had suggested, I found Rosalie
walking by the fields with Mr Hatfield.

773
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:36,640
As I got near them, I thought that Rosalie
certainly did look elegant as she smiled and

774
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,360
chatted to Mr Hatfield.

775
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:44,340
She was walking slowly under the trees, with
her closed book in one hand, a flower in the

776
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,390
other hand and her long dress moving gently
with the light wind.

777
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:54,190
Snap, running ahead of me, interrupted the
romantic moment by grabbing her dress in his

778
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,050
teeth and pulling at it.

779
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:00,840
This carried on for a moment until Mr Hatfield
kicked the dog.

780
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:07,000
Snap ran back to me and as I walked forward
to touch him, I heard Mr Hatfield speak.

781
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,200
'When will I see you again, Miss Murray?'
he asked.

782
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,050
He had realised that my arrival meant that
the time for him to leave had come.

783
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:23,780
'At church, I suppose,' Rosalie replied, 'unless
your work brings you here again, at the exact

784
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:27,160
moment that I happen to be walking in this
field.'

785
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,930
'Well,' he said, 'I could always manage to
have business here, if I knew exactly when

786
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,869
and where to find you.'

787
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:41,650
'Oh,' she said, smiling flirtatiously, 'I
couldn't possibly know today what I might

788
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,609
be doing tomorrow!'

789
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:50,690
'Then let me have that flower you are holding,
to comfort me and remind me of you,' he said,

790
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,130
half-joking and half-serious.

791
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:56,310
He reached his hand out to take the flower.

792
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:59,730
'No,' she said and moved the flower away.

793
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,730
'I won't give you the flower.'

794
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:08,180
'Oh, please do!' he cried, 'I will be a miserable
man if you don't.

795
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,390
Don't be so wicked to me.

796
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:17,390
Why say no for something, which is so easily
given, yet would mean so much to me?

797
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,390
Please!'

798
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:23,990
He could not have sounded more desperate had
he been begging someone to save his life!

799
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,609
Rosalie was clearly enjoying the power she
had over this man.

800
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:35,880
After a few moments, she finally said, 'Oh,
here then,' and gave the flower to him.

801
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,380
'Take it and go!'

802
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,150
He received the gift happily, said something
quietly into her ear that made her laugh and

803
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,030
go red in the face, then he left.

804
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:52,630
'I'm so glad you came,' Rosalie said to me
when he had gone.

805
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,870
'I was beginning to think he would never leave!

806
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:01,780
He's always coining here, pretending that
his work for the church has brought him out

807
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,780
this way.'

808
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,830
'Well,' I began, 'your mother doesn't want
you to go beyond the garden without someone

809
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:11,599
like me to accompany you and fight off all
the men.

810
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:17,260
She saw Mr Hatfield walking towards the fields
and sent me out to take care of you straight

811
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,260
away.'

812
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,240
'Oh, as if I couldn't take care of myself!'

813
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,240
she cried.

814
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,510
'She was telling me to keep away from Mr Hatfield
the other day.

815
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,940
But I wouldn't fall in love with him, or with
anyone!

816
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:33,190
I hate the word 'love'.

817
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:38,940
I might prefer one man to another, but even
then, I would never prefer Mr Hatfield.

818
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:45,100
I like talking to him because he's clever
and funny, but I'm not at all interested in

819
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,100
him - he hasn't got any money!

820
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:52,750
But I must have someone to flirt with and
he's the only person who comes here.

821
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:58,900
When we go out, Mother will only let me flirt
with Sir Thomas Ashby because the plan is

822
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,940
that I will marry him and it's not good for
me to be seen with other men.

823
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,829
But he's boring and not half as nice as Mr
Hatfield.'

824
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:09,829
'Is he?'

825
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:14,069
I asked, 'then why do you want to marry him?'

826
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:20,960
'Well, it doesn't matter that he's boring,'
she replied, 'he's rich, and he'll be all

827
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,490
right when he's married.

828
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:28,030
I just wish he wasn't so ugly, but then there
aren't very many men to choose from here in

829
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,780
the countryside.'

830
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,890
'But wouldn't Mr Hatfield be a better choice?'

831
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,140
I asked.

832
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:40,300
'Well, he would be if he was the lord of Ashby
Park, but he isn't.

833
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:47,260
And the fact is that I must have Ashby Park
and it doesn't matter who I share it with.'

834
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,359
I was shocked by Rosalie's attitude.

835
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,270
'But Mr Hatfield clearly thinks that you like
him!'

836
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,270
I said.

837
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:58,050
'He will be very disappointed when he realizes
he is wrong.'

838
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:02,950
Well, it is his own fault for making assumptions
about what I might feel.

839
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,690
Why on earth does he think that I like him?

840
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:13,950
In fact, I'm looking forward to seeing his
face when I tell him that I don't,' she replied.

841
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,770
There was nothing I could say that would change
her views.

842
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:21,410
Three days went by before Rosalie went to
the fields again.

843
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:26,470
I went with her, but after walking for half
an hour or so she suddenly asked me to go

844
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,609
back to the house to get her book for her.

845
01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:33,410
When I returned, sometime later, she ran towards
me.

846
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:36,680
Her cheeks were pink and she was waving to
me.

847
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,870
'Miss Grey!'

848
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,550
she called, 'I have some exciting news!

849
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:47,950
Just after you left to get my book, Mr Hatfield
suddenly appeared from nowhere.

850
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:52,859
He chatted for a while and was very polite
and said all sorts of things about me.

851
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:55,530
But he is so full of himself!

852
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:59,559
You won't believe this... he actually asked
me to marry him!'

853
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:00,559
'And you...'

854
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,210
I started.

855
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,609
I was worried about what she was about to
tell me.

856
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:12,589
'I stood tall and proud and said how shocked
I was that he had proposed,' Rosalie explained,

857
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:17,590
'I said that surely he had seen nothing in
my behaviour to make him think that I would

858
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,680
want to marry him.

859
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,200
You should have seen him!

860
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,220
His face went white.

861
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:30,030
I told him that I did not want to marry him
and that my parents would never agree to it.

862
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:34,329
He looked terribly sad and I almost felt sorry
for him.

863
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:36,099
Then he seemed angry.

864
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:40,329
He told me that he loved me greatly and that
I had broken his heart.

865
01:03:40,329 --> 01:03:45,750
That I had flirted with him and played with
him like a toy without any thought of marrying

866
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,750
him.

867
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,750
Can you believe that he said that?'

868
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:56,079
I certainly did believe it and I agreed with
Mr Hatfield, but I said nothing.

869
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:02,600
'Then he asked me to keep his proposal to
me a secret and tell no one,' she went on.

870
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,829
'He said that if I didn't keep it a secret
he would tell people what I had done.

871
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:12,810
He said no one would want to marry me if they
knew how badly I had behaved!

872
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:16,050
So I promised and then he left.'

873
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,720
'But you have broken your promise already!'

874
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,349
I said, truly shocked by how she was talking.

875
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:24,800
'Oh, but it's only you.

876
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,130
I know you won't tell anyone,' she said.

877
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:34,490
'And I will tell my mother, just to show her
how wrong she was when she thought that I

878
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:37,060
might fall for him.'

879
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,920
Suddenly I realized why Rosalie seemed so
happy - she could now prove to her mother

880
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,940
that she had been wrong.

881
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:49,740
I was shocked by how she had behaved toward
Mr Hatfield and by how much pleasure she seemed

882
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,859
to get from seeing the poor man suffer.

883
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:58,660
The only positive thing I saw in the situation
was that Mr Hatfield had escaped what surely

884
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:16,470
would have been a very unhappy life with Rosalie.

885
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,000
CHAPTER NINE
The Change of Heart

886
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,410
Oh!

887
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:28,670
I wish Mr Hatfield hadn't proposed so soon!'
said Rosalie to Matilda the next day at four

888
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,839
o'clock, She was looking out through the window
at the fields.

889
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:37,400
'Now there is no reason to go out and nothing
to look forward to,' she added.

890
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,160
'It's a pity you were so hard on him,' said
Matilda.

891
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,839
'He'll never come again and I think that you
actually rather liked him.

892
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,680
I hoped that you would marry him and leave
all the other men free for me to flirt with.'

893
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,610
'Well, I'm sorry to lose Mr Hatfield, I have
to admit.

894
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,990
But there will be other men like him, I suppose.

895
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:03,300
It's Sunday tomorrow...

896
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:07,260
I wonder how he'll look and whether he'll
be able to read his sermon.

897
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,790
He'll probably have to pretend he is ill and
make Mr Weston give the service.'

898
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:15,230
'No, he won't,' said Matilda.

899
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,730
'He's a stronger man than that.'

900
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:25,670
Rosalie was a little offended by Matilda's
comment, but it seemed that Matilda was right.

901
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:28,839
Mr Hatfield spoke during the church service
as normal.

902
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:33,260
But he never once looked towards where the
Murray family were sitting and he did not

903
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,460
leave the church until we had gone.

904
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:40,380
Rosalie was clearly disappointed that he had
not looked at her once.

905
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:45,890
However, she said, it proved that he was thinking
of her all the time, or he would have looked

906
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,490
at her if only by chance.

907
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:52,130
But if he had looked at her, she would have
said it was because he thought her so beautiful

908
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,200
that he had no choice.

909
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,059
After a few more days of being bored at home,
Rosalie asked me to walk with her into the

910
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,339
village.

911
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:04,579
She said that she needed some new pencils
for her drawing.

912
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:10,990
Really, I think she wanted an excuse to see
Mr Hatfield, or flirt with some other men.

913
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:16,329
I have to admit that on the way I also started
to wonder whether we might see Mr Weston in

914
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:17,589
the village.

915
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:23,059
While Rosalie was in the shop buying her pencils
she made me stand by the door to tell her

916
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:25,500
if anyone interesting passed by.

917
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,420
No one did, apart from two of Rosalie's friends,
who stopped and chatted to her for a while

918
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,800
when she came out.

919
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:39,650
While they were talking, I walked a little
way down the street to look in a nearby shop.

920
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:43,250
After only a few minutes, Mr Weston appeared
beside me.

921
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,930
'You are alone again, Miss Grey!' he said.

922
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:53,520
'Yes, but only for a few minutes while Miss
Murray talks to her friends,' I told him.

923
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,559
'But aren't they your friends, too?' he asked.

924
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:03,580
'No,' I replied, 'I don't really have any
friends here in Horton.'

925
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,160
We stood for some time talking in a friendly
way.

926
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,460
We discussed all sorts of things and he asked
me what type of books I liked to read.

927
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:17,960
He listened carefully to what I said, asked
thoughtful questions and seemed interested

928
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,400
in my answers.

929
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,890
Why would he be interested in what I liked
to read and in what I thought and felt?

930
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:30,900
My heart started to beat faster when I thought
about the answer to that question.

931
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,910
Soon Rosalie arrived and saw that I was talking
to Mr Weston.

932
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:41,630
Rather than being cold to him, as I expected,
she smiled and talked to him with unusual

933
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,630
cheerfulness.

934
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:48,180
The three of us began to walk along the country
road towards Horton Lodge.

935
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:53,730
Before long, Rosalie was talking to Mr Weston
in such a way that there was no space in the

936
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,589
conversation for me.

937
01:08:55,589 --> 01:09:01,390
I started to feel upset by this as I listened
to her speak so confidently to him.

938
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:07,560
She smiled at him, laughed at what he said
and swung her fair hair from side to side.

939
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:14,319
After a while, the road divided so we said
goodbye to Mr Weston and turned towards Horton

940
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,319
Lodge.

941
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:18,429
'I thought I could do it!'

942
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:21,770
cried Rosalie once we were some distance away.

943
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,770
'Do what?'

944
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:24,040
I asked.

945
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,570
'I have shot him through the heart,' she said.

946
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:31,500
'He will go home and think of nothing but
me.'

947
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,960
'How do you know?'

948
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,960
I questioned,

949
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:40,719
'Oh, there were many things that gave it away,'
she told me, 'but especially the way that

950
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,489
he looked at me when he said goodbye to us.

951
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:46,870
It was such a gentle, caring look, Ha!

952
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:50,449
He's not quite as stupid as I thought!'

953
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:53,150
I did not answer.

954
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:58,320
My heart felt as if it was in my throat, I
was worried that if I spoke I would cry.

955
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:05,940
'Please, please do not let this happen,' I
said silently to myself, 'for his sake, not

956
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,940
mine.'

957
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:11,730
As we continued the walk back to the house
all I could give were one-word answers to

958
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,820
Rosalie's cheerful chatter.

959
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:18,910
I was in shock and I wanted to go straight
to my room and cry.

960
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:25,780
The next Sunday was one of the greyest days
of April, with dark clouds and heavy rain

961
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,949
showers.

962
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:31,680
I went to church with Rosalie and despite
the recent conversation between Rosalie and

963
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,020
Mr Weston, I was still very much looking forward
to seeing him and hearing him preach the sermon.

964
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:43,430
It was raining heavily and as we were leaving
the church, Rosalie said that she wanted to

965
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,980
wait inside the door for the carriage.

966
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:53,340
Of course, a few moments later Mr Weston came
to the door and Rosalie started a conversation

967
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,860
with him.

968
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,480
She asked him if he would come and see a young
girl who was ill and who lived in one of the

969
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,070
estate cottages.

970
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:05,310
He promised that he would go to see her the
next day.

971
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:12,090
'And what time do you think you might go to
see her?' asked Rosalie, 'I'm sure her mother

972
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:16,980
would like to know so that she can tidy up
the house and make you feel welcome.

973
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:21,310
Perhaps I could come and introduce you to
them.'

974
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:27,880
Rosalie, who usually only thought of herself,
had suddenly become helpful and generous.

975
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,100
Mr Weston said that he would try to be there
at eleven o'clock in the morning.

976
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:37,480
I felt sure that this was just an excuse for
her to meet him again.

977
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,880
The carriage had now arrived and the footman
was waiting with an open umbrella to help

978
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,660
Rosalie get into the carriage.

979
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:49,010
Straight away Mr Weston stepped forward and
offered to cover me with his umbrella.

980
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,930
'No, thank you.

981
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:53,489
I don't mind the rain,' I said.

982
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:58,130
I always said the most stupid things when
I felt shy and did not have much time to think!

983
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:04,150
'But you don't actually like the rain, I suppose?'
he replied, with a smile that showed me that

984
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,800
he was not offended.

985
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:11,100
I could not disagree with that comment and
so I allowed him to cover me with his umbrella

986
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,040
as I walked to the carriage.

987
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,989
He put out his hand to help me climb up the
steps.

988
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:22,179
Then he looked directly into my eyes and smiled
as he closed the little door behind me.

989
01:12:22,179 --> 01:12:29,360
It was only a small smile, and it was only
for a moment, but I saw in it, or I thought

990
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,760
I saw in it, a meaning of great importance.

991
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:38,820
It gave me more hope than I had ever had before
that he might care about me.

992
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,040
The next morning, Rosalie came into the schoolroom.

993
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:48,710
'Matilda, I want you to go for a walk with
me around eleven o'clock today,' she said.

994
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:53,880
I remembered that that was the time Mr Weston
was going to visit the cottagers.

995
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:02,060
'Oh, I can't possibly go for a walk, I'm busy,'
said Matilda, 'Miss Grey must go with you,'

996
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:08,780
'No, I want you to come,' said Rosalie and
explained why in a whisper, so Matilda agreed

997
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,780
to go.

998
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,710
That night at dinner, the girls told me about
their walk.

999
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:19,750
They had bumped into Mr Weston, and had a
long enjoyable walk with him.

1000
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:23,520
They found him surprisingly pleasant and interesting.

1001
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:43,460
And he had clearly enjoyed walking with them
too, they said.

1002
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,350
CHAPTER TEN
Hope is Lost

1003
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:52,820
A few weeks later Rosalie went to a party
that she had been looking forward to since

1004
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,040
the winter.

1005
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:59,410
It was a ball at Ashby Park and she wore an
elegant dress for the occasion.

1006
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:04,090
Early the following morning she came to tell
me her news.

1007
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:11,380
Sir Thomas had proposed to her at the ball,
just as she and her mother had hoped and planned.

1008
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:16,600
Rosalie was very pleased that she was going
to become Lady Ashby and Ashby Park would

1009
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,600
he hers.

1010
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,650
She also loved the idea of a big wedding,
an impressive party and a honeymoon - a special

1011
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:26,870
holiday after the wedding - that would be
spent abroad.

1012
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:32,360
However, the one thing that she seemed disappointed
about was the date of the wedding.

1013
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,600
It was planned to take place in only six weeks'
time, on 1st June.

1014
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:44,420
This meant that she only had a few weeks more
to flirt with other men and enjoy being free.

1015
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:49,820
During this time, she took every chance to
meet Mr Weston and tried every way she could

1016
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,530
to make him interested in her.

1017
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:56,430
She started to visit the poor cottagers, simply
because she knew that she would bump into

1018
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,430
him there.

1019
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,929
Of course, she never asked me to go with her.

1020
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:06,340
She persuaded Matilda to go with her instead
as she had done that first morning.

1021
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:12,170
She made sure that I stayed at home by asking
me to copy out a piece of music or finish

1022
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:14,030
a drawing for her.

1023
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:16,900
I could not understand why she was doing this.

1024
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:21,630
If someone had told me how she was behaving,
I would not have believed it.

1025
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:28,020
But I saw it with my own eyes and suffered
from it too.

1026
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,140
During those six weeks, I was only able to
go to church once or twice.

1027
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:39,530
Rosalie and Matilda found any excuse for me
to stay at home - I was ill or had some work

1028
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:40,770
to finish in the schoolroom.

1029
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:46,500
On these days, when they returned home, they
would sometimes tell me about the conversations

1030
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,530
they had had with Mr Weston.

1031
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:55,080
'He asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,' said
Matilda one day, 'and wondered why he never

1032
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,880
saw you with us anymore.

1033
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:02,130
So we told him you were very well, but that
you just didn't want to come to church and

1034
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,520
that you preferred reading your books at home
to going out.'

1035
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,300
I wondered what on earth he must think of
me, but there was no point in arguing with

1036
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,410
Rosalie and Matilda.

1037
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:18,600
And if I disagreed too strongly with what
they had said, then they would surely realise

1038
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,710
how much I liked and respected Mr Weston.

1039
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:26,790
So I said nothing and kept my feelings for
him a secret.

1040
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:32,100
I tried to feel better by telling myself that
Rosalie would soon be married and gone.

1041
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:37,449
In a few weeks, I would be able to spend the
holidays at home.

1042
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:43,580
During this time, I heard that Mr Weston and
Mr Hatfield could not agree on anything.

1043
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:47,810
This did not surprise me, as they were as
different from each other as two men could

1044
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,810
be.

1045
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:53,310
But I was shocked to hear that because of
this, Mr Weston was soon going to move to

1046
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:56,690
a different job in another place.

1047
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,960
What if he had left Horton by the time I returned
in the autumn?

1048
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,070
I could not stop thinking about him.

1049
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:09,520
It seemed that I may not ever see him again
and this made me feel desperate and alone.

1050
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:16,190
There were two other things that added to
my problems at this time, one small and one

1051
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,210
much more serious.

1052
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:24,090
I was told that Snap, my rough but bright-eyed
little friend, was going to be taken away

1053
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:27,650
from me and given to someone in the village
to look after.

1054
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:33,590
The second thing was that each time I received
a letter from my sister Mary, she told me

1055
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,550
that my father's health was a little worse.

1056
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,290
This worried me very much.

1057
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,570
He had not been at all well the last time
I had seen him.

1058
01:17:42,570 --> 01:18:02,400
I could not help feeling that something terrible
was going to happen.

1059
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:08,940
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Celebration and Sadness

1060
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:14,370
The first day of June arrived and Miss Rosalie
Murray became Lady Ashby.

1061
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:17,960
She certainly looked beautiful on her wedding
day.

1062
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,860
After returning from the church, she came
running into the schoolroom to see me.

1063
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:26,370
'Miss Grey, I am Lady Ashby!'

1064
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:31,810
she said excitedly, 'It is done, there is
no going back now!

1065
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:37,810
I've come to say goodbye because I am going
on my honeymoon now - I'm going to Paris...

1066
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:38,990
Rome...

1067
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,179
Naples...

1068
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:41,360
Switzerland...

1069
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,540
London...

1070
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,730
Oh!

1071
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:49,330
I will be away for months and see and do so
much before I see you again!

1072
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:53,500
Goodbye - the carriage is waiting and they
are calling me.'

1073
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,610
She gave me a very quick kiss on the cheek
and then began to leave.

1074
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,880
But then she turned, came back into the room
and put her arms around me with more love

1075
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,110
and warmth than I had thought she was capable
of.

1076
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:09,570
After this, she left with tears in her eyes.

1077
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,730
Poor girl!

1078
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:17,530
I really loved her then and chose to forget
everything she had done that had hurt me and

1079
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,900
others.

1080
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,840
She had not really known what she was doing,
I felt sure.

1081
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:28,580
I hoped with all my heart that she would be
happy with her new life.

1082
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:34,260
Now that Rosalie had gone, I had much more
free time and I started to visit the cottagers

1083
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,260
again.

1084
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:40,250
I went to see Nancy, partly in the hope that
she could tell me about Mr Weston.

1085
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,380
But she had not seen him for a while.

1086
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,740
I have to admit that I even stayed a little
longer at her cottage in case he came to visit,

1087
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:51,739
but he did not.

1088
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:56,110
Sunday came and I was able to go to church
and hear Mr Weston preach.

1089
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:02,300
It had been several weeks since I had been
to church and I was happy to be able to see

1090
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,070
him and listen to him.

1091
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:10,820
I walked home afterwards with Matilda, but
he did not come to talk to us and nor did

1092
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,560
he walk home with us.

1093
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,730
Matilda was as disappointed as I was that
we had to walk home alone.

1094
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:22,670
Now that her sister had got married, Matilda
had started to think about when her time would

1095
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,489
come to do the same.

1096
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:30,040
Mrs Murray, too, had time to worry about her
younger daughter and to look for a husband

1097
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,650
for her.

1098
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:36,590
I was told that I must work extra hard because
the young lady's manners needed to be much

1099
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:38,219
better.

1100
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:43,510
Matilda was told that she was no longer allowed
to go riding every day or play with the dogs.

1101
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:50,380
Just when I thought, my job had become much
easier, it began to get harder again.

1102
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:57,130
In addition to long hours in the schoolroom,
Mrs Murray had decided that Matilda needed

1103
01:20:57,130 --> 01:21:01,440
exercise and should go on walks every day.

1104
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,070
It was on one of these walks that Matilda
and I saw Mr Weston by chance.

1105
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:12,830
I had hoped this would happen for such a long
time, but now I felt very nervous.

1106
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:16,050
My heart was beating very fast.

1107
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:21,530
I was worried that how I was feeling would
be clear to both Matilda and Mr Weston himself.

1108
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:29,620
However, I need not have worried because he
hardly looked at me and spoke first to Matilda.

1109
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:34,050
He asked if she had heard from her sister,
Rosalie.

1110
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:40,170
'Yes,' she replied, 'She was in Paris when
she last wrote to us and she was very well.

1111
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,620
And very happy, of course.'

1112
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:48,190
After these last few words, she looked at
Mr Weston carefully, waiting to see what he

1113
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,190
would say.

1114
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:56,670
'I hope she will continue to be very happy,'
he commented, in what seemed like a sincere

1115
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,670
way.

1116
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,070
'Do you think it is likely?'

1117
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:06,300
I asked him once Matilda had walked away to
look at some horses in a field nearby.

1118
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,790
'I don't know,' he replied.

1119
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:13,650
'According to what people have told me about
Sir Thomas and from what I have seen myself

1120
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:18,270
of his behaviour, I have my doubts about Miss
Rosalie's happiness.

1121
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:22,250
It is a pity that she has married him.

1122
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:29,200
Even though Miss Rosalie can be very thoughtless,
she is so young and cheerful and... well,

1123
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,200
interesting.

1124
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:35,020
I suppose that she has married him because
that is what her mother wanted her to do.

1125
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,170
Is that right?'

1126
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:41,050
'Yes, and it is also what she wanted, I think.

1127
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:46,680
She always laughed when I tried to persuade
her not to marry him,' I explained.

1128
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:53,130
'Well, if you told her not to marry him then
at least you know that you are in no way responsible

1129
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:56,750
if the marriage is an unhappy one!' he told
me.

1130
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,560
At that moment, Matilda appeared again.

1131
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,590
After talking for a little while longer, Mr
Weston said goodbye and continued on his journey

1132
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,760
down the road.

1133
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,960
However, just a few minutes later he returned
with some bluebells in his hand.

1134
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,540
He offered the beautiful blue flowers to me
and smiled.

1135
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:23,300
'I haven't forgotten how much you like spring
flowers,' Mr Weston said, 'even though I have

1136
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:27,370
hardly seen you over the last two months.'

1137
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,179
He gave the flowers to me in a very simple,
polite way.

1138
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:36,760
But it meant a lot to me - he had thought
of me and had remembered the type of flowers

1139
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,210
that I liked!

1140
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:43,570
'Miss Rosalie and Miss Matilda told me that
you were so busy reading and studying that

1141
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:46,030
you never left the house,' he said.

1142
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:51,460
'Yes,' said Matilda very quickly, 'and it's
true!'

1143
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:55,970
'No, Mr Weston, don't believe it,' I told
him.

1144
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:58,090
'It's a terrible lie.

1145
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:03,510
Some young ladies say things which aren't
true without worrying if it might upset their

1146
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,510
friends.

1147
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,170
You should be careful not to believe everything
they say.'

1148
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:13,690
'Well, I certainly hope that in this case
it is a lie, Miss Grey,' he said.

1149
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:19,420
'It would be a great shame if you chose to
read and study so much that you had no time

1150
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,750
for anything else.'

1151
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:25,400
Then we said goodbye again and he left.

1152
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,900
You might be wondering why I have written
down all of this detail.

1153
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,590
You may think it is not interesting enough
to write about.

1154
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:37,760
But these conversations were important because
they gave me hope.

1155
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,489
That evening I spent time remembering how
kind and thoughtful Mr Weston had been towards

1156
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:44,489
me.

1157
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:45,840
I dreamt that night of his smiling face.

1158
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:54,400
The next morning I woke up full of happiness
and I was not able to think of anything else

1159
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,880
other than him.

1160
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:00,469
Hope, however, can leave as quickly as it
can arrive.

1161
01:25:00,469 --> 01:25:06,409
Later that same morning I received a letter
from my mother, which told me that, my father

1162
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:09,610
was now very seriously ill.

1163
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:14,600
Just two days later another letter came, this
time from my sister, Mary.

1164
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:20,300
In her letter, she told me that she thought
my father was going to die very soon.

1165
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:26,350
I went straight to Mrs Murray, explained the
situation to her and asked her if she would

1166
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,270
let me go home to my family.

1167
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,480
At first, she just looked at me.

1168
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,260
Then she asked me why I was so upset - my
father may not be as ill as my mother and

1169
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:39,750
sister had said, she told me.

1170
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:44,750
And if not, well, we must all die one day,
she added.

1171
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:49,070
Finally, she agreed to let me return to my
family.

1172
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:53,130
I packed my things and left as soon as I could.

1173
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:58,840
It was a long journey and it was half-past
ten at night by the time I finally arrived

1174
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,699
home.

1175
01:26:00,699 --> 01:26:04,170
My mother and sister met me at the front door.

1176
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:08,699
Both of them looked serious and were tired
and pale.

1177
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:10,780
'Oh, Agnes!'

1178
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:15,489
cried my mother and Mary started to cry.

1179
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:18,350
'How is he?'

1180
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:20,260
I asked.

1181
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,550
'Dead!' came the reply.

1182
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:45,070
It was the answer I had expected, but it was
still a terrible shock to me.

1183
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:50,380
CHAPTER TWELVE
Saying Goodbye

1184
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:53,170
My father was buried a few days later.

1185
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:58,280
My mother, sister and I then sat down together
at home and talked about what we should now

1186
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,570
do.

1187
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:05,550
After a long discussion, it was decided that
the family home would be sold.

1188
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:10,610
My mother's plan was to buy a smaller house
near the coast and turn it into a school for

1189
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,840
young ladies.

1190
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,920
In this way, she believed she could earn enough
money to live on.

1191
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,110
'What do you think of the idea, Agnes?'

1192
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,260
she asked me.

1193
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:26,270
'Would you leave your job with the Murray
family to come and help run a school with

1194
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,270
me?'

1195
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:36,239
'Yes, of course,' I told her, 'and the money
I have earned will buy us furniture and equipment.'

1196
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,780
It was sad to say goodbye to the old family
home.

1197
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:45,330
I had been born in that house and had spent
my early years there.

1198
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:50,409
My mother said she would stay until the house
was sold and she would make all the preparations

1199
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:51,750
for the new school.

1200
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:56,800
So I went back to Horton Lodge to work the
last six weeks that were still left before

1201
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,140
the summer holidays.

1202
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:04,300
Having explained to Mrs Murray what had happened,
I told her that I would not be returning in

1203
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,040
the autumn.

1204
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:12,100
During those last six weeks at Horton, I hardly
saw Mr Weston.

1205
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:18,350
Every day I hoped I would bump into him on
my walks, but for the first two weeks, I saw

1206
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,810
him only at church.

1207
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:26,239
I felt disappointed and I told myself that
he clearly did not care for me.

1208
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:29,910
If he loved me, would he not come to find
me?

1209
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,719
How silly I had been to hope that he might
care about me.

1210
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:36,630
I should forget all about him.

1211
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:40,699
But then, at last, I saw him.

1212
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:45,260
He was on the path walking towards me as I
was going through the fields to Nancy Brown's

1213
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:47,840
cottage for a visit.

1214
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,670
He must have heard from people in the village
that my father had died, but he did not mention

1215
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:54,670
it.

1216
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:58,940
But almost the first words he spoke were,
'How is your mother?'

1217
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:02,330
It was a sincere question that seemed full
of warmth.

1218
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:08,830
I thanked him for asking about her and told
him she was as well as could be expected but

1219
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:10,870
sad, of course.

1220
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:15,489
'What is she going to do?' he asked kindly.

1221
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:20,929
I explained to him that my mother was planning
to open a new school and that I was going

1222
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:22,820
to help her to run it.

1223
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:26,800
'Then are you going to leave Horton Lodge
soon?' he said.

1224
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,520
'Yes, in a month,' I replied.

1225
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:36,000
He said nothing for a minute and it seemed
as though he was deep in thought.

1226
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,720
Then he spoke again, 'And do you want to leave
here?'

1227
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:44,920
'Yes, in some ways,' I told him.

1228
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,320
'Only "in some ways"...

1229
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:52,410
I wonder what things might make you want to
stay?' he said.

1230
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,420
He sounded surprised.

1231
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:59,949
I did not like this question, partly because
it embarrassed me.

1232
01:29:59,949 --> 01:30:05,159
I had only one reason to want to stay and
that reason was a big secret.

1233
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:10,990
'Why have you made the assumption that I am
not happy in this place?'

1234
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:11,990
I asked.

1235
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,850
'Because you told me yourself that you missed
your family terribly and that you had no friends

1236
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,400
here,' Mr Weston said.

1237
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:25,630
'Well,' I replied, 'that may be true, but
it would be impossible to live somewhere for

1238
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:29,290
two years without feeling some sadness when
you leave.'

1239
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:36,880
'Will you be sad to leave Miss Matilda, who
is your only pupil and friend now?' he asked.

1240
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:42,140
'It will probably be a little difficult to
say goodbye to her, I did feel sad when I

1241
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,000
said goodbye to her sister,' I admitted.

1242
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,340
'Yes, I can imagine that,' he commented.

1243
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:57,060
'Well, Miss Matilda is as nice as Miss Rosalie,
or perhaps actually nicer than her in one

1244
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,500
way,' I told him.

1245
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,960
'In what way is that?' he wanted to know.

1246
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:09,030
'She usually tells the truth,' I said simply,
'so at least I can say she is honest.'

1247
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:14,060
'And her older sister is not?' he said.

1248
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:19,400
'Well, perhaps she is not actually dishonest,
but I have to admit that she can be quite

1249
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,530
creative with the truth,' I told him.

1250
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:29,800
'Ah,' he said thoughtfully, 'so she is creative
with the truth?

1251
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:35,200
I could see that she was a bit silly and loved
to talk about herself, yes.

1252
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,400
And now I can believe that she wasn't fully
honest either.

1253
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:44,179
That would certainly explain a few things
that I hadn't understood before.'

1254
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:50,199
After that, he changed the subject and talked
about more general things.

1255
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:54,300
He did not leave me until he had walked with
me to the gates of Horton Lodge.

1256
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,449
He must have gone out of his way to walk that
far with me.

1257
01:31:58,449 --> 01:32:05,530
He had not mentioned love, or led me to believe
that he cared for me, but I was very happy

1258
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:07,310
despite this.

1259
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:13,170
To be near him, to hear him talk, to know
that he wanted to speak to me was enough to

1260
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,890
make me happy.

1261
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:18,590
'Yes, Mr Edward Weston.

1262
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:25,780
If I had one friend here, one friend who truly
loved me and if that friend were you... then

1263
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,760
I would definitely want to stay here.

1264
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:33,030
I would be happier than I can imagine,' I
thought to myself.

1265
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,969
'Who knows what can happen in a month?

1266
01:32:35,969 --> 01:32:41,730
I am twenty-two years old and the last few
years have been hard.

1267
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:48,230
But perhaps I will be lucky now, perhaps the
sun will shine on me at last...'

1268
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:54,469
I remained hopeful for a while but the time
I had left in Horton slowly passed away, one

1269
01:32:54,469 --> 01:32:58,500
week after another, and I hardly saw him.

1270
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,690
And then the last Sunday came and I went to
the village church for the last time to hear

1271
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:09,390
him preach, I listened to his sermon, surely
the last one of his I would hear, and I tried

1272
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:11,460
hard not to cry.

1273
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:18,520
After the service, I was leaving the church
when I heard a quiet voice just behind me.

1274
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,770
'I suppose you are leaving Horton this week,
Miss Grey?' said Mr Weston.

1275
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:26,320
'Yes,' I replied.

1276
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,560
I was surprised to see him standing there.

1277
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:35,570
'Well,' he said, 'I just wanted to say goodbye
before you leave.'

1278
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:38,630
'Goodbye, Mr Weston,' I said.

1279
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:41,750
How difficult it was to say that calmly!

1280
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:48,739
I gave him my hand and he held it gently in
his own hands for a few seconds.

1281
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:52,980
'It is possible that we may meet again in
the future,' he said.

1282
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:59,110
'Would it make any difference to you whether
we did or not?'

1283
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,851
'Yes,' I said.

1284
01:34:00,851 --> 01:34:02,810
'I would be very glad to see you again.'

1285
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:08,900
He held my hand gently in his for a moment
and then left.

1286
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:14,480
Now I was happy again, although probably more
likely to burst into tears than ever.

1287
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,320
I walked home with Matilda, but I could not
concentrate on what she was saying.

1288
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:27,320
All I could think about was Mr Weston... how
he had held my hand, how he had smiled kindly

1289
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,510
at me and what he had said.

1290
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:33,140
After several minutes, Matilda suddenly shouted
at me.

1291
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,880
'Are you deaf or stupid, Miss Grey?

1292
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:40,830
Have you not heard anything that I have been
telling you?'

1293
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:42,880
she cried.

1294
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,650
Matilda had woken me from my daydreams about
Mr Weston.

1295
01:34:46,650 --> 01:35:06,040
I looked up at her and asked her to tell me
again what she had been saying.

1296
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,110
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The School

1297
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:15,700
I left Horton Lodge and went to join my mother
in Scarborough, a popular town on the coast

1298
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,530
in Yorkshire.

1299
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:22,120
She seemed to be in good health and had organised
the new schoolhouse well.

1300
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:28,489
To begin with, we had nine students but we
hoped to have more pupils in the future.

1301
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:32,790
I was happy to start work with my mother and
it was certainly different compared to the

1302
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:35,180
jobs I had already had.

1303
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:39,120
In the first few weeks, I enjoyed teaching
the pupils and I was happy.

1304
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,690
When I was not busy, I daydreamed about Mr
Weston.

1305
01:35:43,690 --> 01:35:50,100
'It is possible that we may meet again in
the future,' and Would it make any difference

1306
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,010
to you whether we did or not?'

1307
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:56,440
- I repeated his words over and over again
in my head.

1308
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:58,560
They gave me great hope.

1309
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,260
'I will see him again.

1310
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:07,280
He will come and visit me or he will write
to me,' I told myself.

1311
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,580
Whenever I heard a knock at the front door
and the maid came to say that a gentleman

1312
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,730
was there, I hoped it was him.

1313
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:18,679
And every time the postman came I felt sure
that he was going to bring a letter from Mr

1314
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:19,679
Weston.

1315
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,070
But each time I was terribly disappointed.

1316
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:28,600
Mr Weston did not come and no letter arrived.

1317
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:33,150
I began to wonder if I had imagined the moment,
I had shared with him on that last Sunday

1318
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,300
outside the church.

1319
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:38,200
As the months passed, I began to lose hope.

1320
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:43,400
I told myself I had been stupid to think that
he liked me.

1321
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,120
He had just been trying to be polite.

1322
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:51,670
'Agnes, you do not seem very well,' said my
mother one day in April.

1323
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:55,200
'I don't think this change has done you any
good at all.

1324
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,830
I've never seen you look so sad and tired.

1325
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:01,739
You should relax and go out a little more.'

1326
01:37:01,739 --> 01:37:03,360
My mother was right.

1327
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,929
I had given up hope and now felt miserable.

1328
01:37:06,929 --> 01:37:11,650
I often did not feel hungry and I was beginning
to feel weak and ill.

1329
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:16,909
I told myself that I needed to look after
myself for my mother's sake.

1330
01:37:16,909 --> 01:37:19,950
She needed me with her and needed my help.

1331
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:25,130
If I could not be happy myself, at least I
could make sure that she was happy.

1332
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:31,360
I decided not to think about Mr Weston anymore,
or at least I would try not to.

1333
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,711
I told myself that I would go for walks and
eat well.

1334
01:37:34,711 --> 01:37:35,711
By following these rules I made for myself,
I started to feel a little better.

1335
01:37:35,711 --> 01:37:36,711
In June I received a letter from Lady Ashby,
or as I had known her before her marriage,

1336
01:37:36,711 --> 01:37:37,711
Miss Rosalie.

1337
01:37:37,711 --> 01:37:38,711
In her letter, she told me that life was very
boring at Ashby Park and that she would very

1338
01:37:38,711 --> 01:37:39,711
much like to see me.

1339
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:40,711
To my dearest Miss Grey,

1340
01:37:40,711 --> 01:37:41,711
I hope you are well and are not missing Horton
Lodge too much.

1341
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:42,711
I have been at Ashby Park a little while now
and it is beautiful, but so dull!

1342
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:43,711
I do not have a single friend here.

1343
01:37:43,711 --> 01:37:44,711
And you know that I never liked the idea of
just my husband and I living tightly together

1344
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:45,711
like two birds in a nest.

1345
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:46,711
I am sure that your holidays will begin in
June.

1346
01:37:46,711 --> 01:37:47,711
When they do, please come and see me straight
away!

1347
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:48,711
In fact, if you do not come I think.

1348
01:37:48,711 --> 01:37:49,711
I might die.

1349
01:37:49,711 --> 01:37:50,711
I want you to come and see we a friend, and
not as my old governess.

1350
01:37:50,711 --> 01:37:51,711
You will have your own room and as many books
as you can read.

1351
01:37:51,711 --> 01:37:52,711
Do you like babies?

1352
01:37:52,711 --> 01:37:53,711
I can't remember if you do or do not.

1353
01:37:53,711 --> 01:37:54,711
If you do, you will want to meet mine.

1354
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:55,711
It well behaved and thankfully I have a maid
here to look after it for me.

1355
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:56,711
Unfortunately, it is a girl and Sir Thomas
is disappointed that I did not give him a

1356
01:37:56,711 --> 01:37:57,711
son instead.

1357
01:37:57,711 --> 01:37:58,711
But if you visit me I promise that you will
be its governess as soon as it can talk.

1358
01:37:58,711 --> 01:37:59,711
You can teach it and make it into a much better
woman than its mother.

1359
01:37:59,711 --> 01:38:00,711
You will be able to see my wonderful new home
and I am sure that you will love it.

1360
01:38:00,711 --> 01:38:01,711
It is full expensive Italian paintings and
all sorts of things that I bought while on,

1361
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:02,711
my honeymoon.

1362
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:03,711
And you can meet my new dog, which I had sent
over all the way from Park.

1363
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:04,711
Write to me as soon as you can and tell me
when your holidays start.

1364
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:05,711
Tell me that you will come on, the very first
day that you can and that you will stay until

1365
01:38:05,711 --> 01:38:06,711
the moment you have to return.

1366
01:38:06,711 --> 01:38:07,711
Your friend, Rosalie Ashby

1367
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:08,711
I showed this strange letter to my mother
and asked her what I should do.

1368
01:38:08,711 --> 01:38:09,711
She advised me to go to Ashby Park and visit
Rosalie, I liked the idea of going to see

1369
01:38:09,711 --> 01:38:10,711
her and her new baby.

1370
01:38:10,711 --> 01:38:11,711
I hoped that I could help her if she were
unhappy.

1371
01:38:11,711 --> 01:38:12,711
Of course, I imagined that she must be unhappy,
or she would not have written to me in this

1372
01:38:12,711 --> 01:38:13,711
way.

1373
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:14,711
I wrote back to her and agreed to go and stay
with her for a few days.

1374
01:38:14,711 --> 01:38:15,711
I had partly agreed to go because Ashby Park
was not far from the village of Horton.

1375
01:38:15,711 --> 01:38:16,711
I secretly hoped that I might see Mr Weston
while I was there, or at least hear something

1376
01:38:16,711 --> 01:38:17,711
about him.

1377
01:38:17,711 --> 01:38:18,711
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
A Visit to Ashby Park

1378
01:38:18,711 --> 01:38:19,711
There was no doubt that Ashby Park was a wonderful
place to live.

1379
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,711
The house itself was impressive and elegant
and the large park was beautiful.

1380
01:38:20,711 --> 01:38:21,711
There was a big lake, ancient woods and herds
of deer.

1381
01:38:21,711 --> 01:38:22,711
I could see why Rosalie had been so keen to
become the lady of an estate like this one.

1382
01:38:22,711 --> 01:38:23,711
She seemed pleased to see me and although
I was just a poor governess and a schoolteacher,

1383
01:38:23,711 --> 01:38:24,711
she welcomed me warmly to her home.

1384
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:25,711
However, I did not like her efforts to make
me feel comfortable.

1385
01:38:25,711 --> 01:38:26,711
She told me that I should not be embarrassed
about how I looked.

1386
01:38:26,711 --> 01:38:27,711
She also said I should not worry if I felt
that the beauty of the place was too much

1387
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:28,711
for me.

1388
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:29,711
I did not feel at all embarrassed about how
I looked.

1389
01:38:29,711 --> 01:38:30,711
And nothing that I saw around me in Ashby
Park shocked me half as much as the changes

1390
01:38:30,711 --> 01:38:31,711
I saw in Rosalie herself.

1391
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:32,711
During the twelve months since I had last
seen her she had changed in a way you might

1392
01:38:32,711 --> 01:38:33,711
expect to see after twelve years, not months.

1393
01:38:33,711 --> 01:38:34,711
She was much thinner, looked very tired and
seemed sad.

1394
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:35,711
Her new baby girl, who Sir Thomas felt should
have been a boy, was just seven or eight weeks

1395
01:38:35,711 --> 01:38:36,711
of age.

1396
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:37,711
I was surprised to see that Rosalie did not
seem to be interested in the baby.

1397
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:38,711
She was happy to let the maid take care of
everything that the baby needed.

1398
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:39,711
My bedroom was small but pleasant.

1399
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:40,711
Rosalie also showed me a small sitting room
where I could spend time alone and read if

1400
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:41,711
I wanted to.

1401
01:38:41,711 --> 01:38:42,711
I was taken on a tour of the house and was
shown the fine Italian paintings and the fat

1402
01:38:42,711 --> 01:38:43,711
French dog that was lying on an expensive-looking
cushion.

1403
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:44,711
Rosalie seemed very pleased with all these
things.

1404
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:45,711
However, when we had finished the tour she
took me into the main sitting room and then

1405
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:46,711
sat down in a chair.

1406
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:47,711
We sat in silence for a moment.

1407
01:38:47,711 --> 01:38:48,711
Despite all of these impressive things that
she had wanted so much, Rosalie did not seem

1408
01:38:48,711 --> 01:38:49,711
happy.

1409
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:50,711
I asked her some questions, deciding to save
my most important question until last.

1410
01:38:50,711 --> 01:38:51,711
I started by asking her how her parents were.

1411
01:38:51,711 --> 01:38:52,711
She told me that they were well enough.

1412
01:38:52,711 --> 01:38:53,711
'And how is Matilda?'

1413
01:38:53,711 --> 01:38:54,711
I asked her.

1414
01:38:54,711 --> 01:38:55,711
'Oh, she is very well,' Rosalie replied.

1415
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:56,711
'She is still wild and a little silly, but
she has now got a new, fashionable governess.

1416
01:38:56,711 --> 01:38:57,711
At last her manners are improving and Mother
will soon hold a ball at Horton Lodge so that

1417
01:38:57,711 --> 01:38:58,711
she can be introduced to society.'

1418
01:38:58,711 --> 01:38:59,711
'And how are the other people in the village?'

1419
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:00,711
I asked.

1420
01:39:00,711 --> 01:39:01,711
'Mr Hatfield, for example?'

1421
01:39:01,711 --> 01:39:02,711
'Ah, Mr Hatfield!'

1422
01:39:02,711 --> 01:39:03,711
she said with a smile.

1423
01:39:03,711 --> 01:39:04,711
'I heard that he proposed to an old spinster
and married her not long ago.

1424
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:05,711
He must have decided that he had not been
lucky when he chose someone young and beautiful,

1425
01:39:05,711 --> 01:39:06,711
so now he has chosen someone old and rich!'

1426
01:39:06,711 --> 01:39:07,711
'And the Meltham family?'

1427
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:08,711
I continued, ignoring her comment about Mr
Hatfield.

1428
01:39:08,711 --> 01:39:09,711
'Oh, I don't know much about them.

1429
01:39:09,711 --> 01:39:10,711
I suppose they are all right,' she told me.

1430
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,711
'Well, I think I have asked about everybody...

1431
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:12,711
oh, but not Mr Weston,' I said.

1432
01:39:12,711 --> 01:39:13,711
'What is he doing?'

1433
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:14,711
'I don't know.

1434
01:39:14,711 --> 01:39:15,711
He's not in Horton anymore,' Rosalie told
me.

1435
01:39:15,711 --> 01:39:16,711
'How long ago did he leave?

1436
01:39:16,711 --> 01:39:17,711
And where has he gone?'

1437
01:39:17,711 --> 01:39:18,711
I asked, trying not to sound too interested
to hear her reply.

1438
01:39:18,711 --> 01:39:19,711
'I don't know anything about him,' she said,
looking out of the window.

1439
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:20,711
'Only that he left about a month ago.

1440
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:21,711
I didn't ask where he had gone.

1441
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:22,711
It seems that all the people in the village
were very upset when he left because they

1442
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:23,711
liked him so much.

1443
01:39:23,711 --> 01:39:24,711
Mr Hatfield did not like them all making a
fuss about him leaving, of course.

1444
01:39:24,711 --> 01:39:25,711
He did not like Mr Weston because he was so
popular and he did not do things the way he

1445
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:26,711
was told to.'

1446
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:27,711
Then Rosalie stood up.

1447
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:28,711
'Anyway, I really must go and rest for a while
before dinner.

1448
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:29,711
I will have to eat with Sir Thomas and his
mother, old Lady Ashby, in the formal dining

1449
01:39:29,711 --> 01:39:30,711
room.

1450
01:39:30,711 --> 01:39:31,711
It's so dull.

1451
01:39:31,711 --> 01:39:32,711
But I'll ask the maid to bring your dinner
to you in the sitting room, if that is all

1452
01:39:32,711 --> 01:39:33,711
right?'

1453
01:39:33,711 --> 01:39:34,711
I told her it was.

1454
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:35,711
She had invited me to her home, as her 'friend'
but we both knew that the social rules meant

1455
01:39:35,711 --> 01:39:36,711
that it would not be correct for a poor schoolteacher
to eat dinner with people as important as

1456
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:37,711
Sir Thomas and Lady Ashby.

1457
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:38,711
I walked back to the little sitting room where
I could relax and look out onto the gardens.

1458
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:39,711
I ate my dinner there and then sat for a while
thinking about Lady Ashby's present life and

1459
01:39:39,711 --> 01:39:40,711
her past life, and about the little information
she had given me about Mr Weston.

1460
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:41,711
I was not rich enough to own a watch, so I
did not know what time it was or how long

1461
01:39:41,711 --> 01:39:42,711
I had been sitting and thinking.

1462
01:39:42,711 --> 01:39:43,711
The sun began to disappear behind the trees
of the estate.

1463
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:44,711
As it began to get dark, I felt lonely.

1464
01:39:44,711 --> 01:39:45,711
I was tired and wished that I could go home.

1465
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:46,711
I was thinking about going back to my room
when Rosalie appeared.

1466
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:47,711
She apologised several times for having left
me alone for so long.

1467
01:39:47,711 --> 01:39:48,711
She blamed her 'horrible old mother-in-law',
who she said had made her stay longer in the

1468
01:39:48,711 --> 01:39:49,711
dining room.

1469
01:39:49,711 --> 01:39:50,711
'But I don't know why I had to stay there
so long,' she added.

1470
01:39:50,711 --> 01:39:51,711
'Sir Thomas never really listens to me.

1471
01:39:51,711 --> 01:39:52,711
When he is in a bad mood all he does is complain
and when he is in a good mood all he does

1472
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:53,711
is talk nonsense.

1473
01:39:53,711 --> 01:39:54,711
And then, in either situation, he always drinks
too much and falls asleep on the sofa!'

1474
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:55,711
'Could you not ask him to drink less and keep
him busy with something else?'

1475
01:39:55,711 --> 01:39:56,711
I suggested.

1476
01:39:56,711 --> 01:39:57,711
'After all, you are very persuasive and are
very good at keeping a man entertained.'

1477
01:39:57,711 --> 01:39:58,711
'You think I am here to entertain him!'

1478
01:39:58,711 --> 01:39:59,711
she cried.

1479
01:39:59,711 --> 01:40:00,711
'That's not my idea of a wife.

1480
01:40:00,711 --> 01:40:01,711
It is the husband's job to keep his wife happy;
it's not her responsibility to please him.

1481
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:02,711
And no, I will not persuade him to change
his habits.

1482
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:03,711
I have enough work just putting up with him
as he is without making even more of an effort

1483
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:04,711
in order to change him.'

1484
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:05,711
She paused to take a breath.

1485
01:40:05,711 --> 01:40:06,711
'But I am so sorry that I left you alone for
so long.

1486
01:40:06,711 --> 01:40:07,711
What have you been doing?'

1487
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:08,711
'Well, mainly sitting here looking at the
park,' I admitted.

1488
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:09,711
'Goodness!

1489
01:40:09,711 --> 01:40:10,711
How boring that must have been!'

1490
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:11,711
she told me.

1491
01:40:11,711 --> 01:40:12,711
'Well, let's go to bed now, but tomorrow I
will show you around the park.'

1492
01:40:12,711 --> 01:40:13,711
The next morning after breakfast Rosalie took
me to see the gardens as she had promised.

1493
01:40:13,711 --> 01:40:14,711
We walked through the park, talking about
what Rosalie had seen and done on her honeymoon.

1494
01:40:14,711 --> 01:40:15,711
While we were walking, a gentleman on a horse
rode towards us.

1495
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:16,711
As he passed us, he looked straight at me,
so I could clearly see what he looked like.

1496
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:17,711
He was tall and very thin with a pale face
that was a little grey.

1497
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:18,711
He had dull, cold eyes.

1498
01:40:18,711 --> 01:40:19,711
He made no attempt to say hello to us.

1499
01:40:19,711 --> 01:40:20,711
'I hate that man,' Lady Ashby said quietly
as soon as he had ridden away.

1500
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:21,711
'Who is he?'

1501
01:40:21,711 --> 01:40:22,711
I asked her.

1502
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:23,711
'Sir Thomas Ashby,' she replied coldly, 'my
husband.'

1503
01:40:23,711 --> 01:40:24,711
I was shocked, but I asked her, 'Do you really
hate him?'

1504
01:40:24,711 --> 01:40:25,711
'Yes, I do, Miss Grey, and if you knew him
you would not blame me for hating him,' she

1505
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:26,711
told me.

1506
01:40:26,711 --> 01:40:27,711
'But you knew what he was like before you
married him,' I commented.

1507
01:40:27,711 --> 01:40:28,711
'No, I only thought I knew him,' she said.

1508
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:29,711
'I remember that you told me not to marry
him.

1509
01:40:29,711 --> 01:40:30,711
I know that I should have listened to you,
but it's too late to say that now.

1510
01:40:30,711 --> 01:40:31,711
At first, I thought that what he was like
wouldn't matter.

1511
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:32,711
I thought he would let me do whatever I liked.

1512
01:40:32,711 --> 01:40:33,711
But he keeps me here like a prisoner and he
pays me no attention.

1513
01:40:33,711 --> 01:40:34,711
He won't let me go to London and have fun
with my friends because he says that I flirt

1514
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:35,711
with other men and spend too much money.

1515
01:40:35,711 --> 01:40:36,711
But he does exactly what he wants!

1516
01:40:36,711 --> 01:40:37,711
He goes to London and leaves me here alone.

1517
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:38,711
He gambles and flirts with other women and
is almost always drunk.

1518
01:40:38,711 --> 01:40:39,711
Oh, I would give anything, anything at all
not to be married to that horrible man, but

1519
01:40:39,711 --> 01:40:40,711
to be Miss Murray again!'

1520
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:41,711
Then she stopped speaking and burst into tears.

1521
01:40:41,711 --> 01:40:42,711
Of course, I felt very sorry for her, I tried
to comfort her and give her some advice.

1522
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:43,711
I told her to keep calm and try to be polite
to her husband.

1523
01:40:43,711 --> 01:40:44,711
I suggested that she should try not to think
about him and keep herself busy with other

1524
01:40:44,711 --> 01:40:45,711
things, perhaps reading and especially her
new little daughter.

1525
01:40:45,711 --> 01:40:46,711
I reminded her that her little baby would
grow into a young woman who would truly love

1526
01:40:46,711 --> 01:40:47,711
her.

1527
01:40:47,711 --> 01:40:48,711
'But what if the child grows up to be just
like its father?'

1528
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:49,711
cried Rosalie.

1529
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:50,711
'I don't think that is likely.

1530
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:51,711
She is a girl and she looks very much like
you,' I told her.

1531
01:40:51,711 --> 01:40:52,711
'Even so, I can't put all of my hopes in a
child,' she said.

1532
01:40:52,711 --> 01:40:53,711
'It is only one step better than focusing
your whole life on a dog.

1533
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:54,711
And I can't spend my life reading.

1534
01:40:54,711 --> 01:40:55,711
I am young and I should be having fun!'

1535
01:40:55,711 --> 01:40:56,711
'The best way to enjoy yourself,' I told her,
'is to do what is right and hate nobody.

1536
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:57,711
The more wise and good you are the more happiness
you have.

1537
01:40:57,711 --> 01:40:58,711
And I have one more piece of advice to offer
you - don't make an enemy of your mother-in-law.

1538
01:40:58,711 --> 01:40:59,711
I have never met her, but I have heard good
things as well as bad things about her.

1539
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:00,711
If you could be kind to her I believe that
in time she could become a good friend for

1540
01:41:00,711 --> 01:41:01,711
you here.'

1541
01:41:01,711 --> 01:41:02,711
But I am afraid that Rosalie did not really
listen to any of the advice I had given her.

1542
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:03,711
I realized that I could be of little help
to her and this made it even more painful

1543
01:41:03,711 --> 01:41:04,711
for me to see what her life had become.

1544
01:41:04,711 --> 01:41:05,711
Rosalie begged me to stay longer, but after
two more days, I told her that my mother needed

1545
01:41:05,711 --> 01:41:06,711
me at the school.

1546
01:41:06,711 --> 01:41:07,711
I was very sorry to say goodbye to Rosalie
and leave her in her wonderful, but sad, house.

1547
01:41:07,711 --> 01:41:08,711
I knew she was very unhappy but I could see
no easy way out of the life, which she herself

1548
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,711
had chosen.

1549
01:41:09,711 --> 01:41:10,711
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
A Walk on the Beach

1550
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:11,711
The school that my mother owned in Scarborough
was a short distance from the sea.

1551
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:12,711
I loved being near the sea and I would sometimes
walk along the beach in my free time.

1552
01:41:12,711 --> 01:41:13,711
I awoke on the third morning after my return
from Ashby Park and saw that the sun was shining.

1553
01:41:13,711 --> 01:41:14,711
Knowing that my mother would still be asleep,
I quietly got dressed and left the house to

1554
01:41:14,711 --> 01:41:15,711
go for an early-morning walk.

1555
01:41:15,711 --> 01:41:16,711
The sea air was fresh and the summer sky was
a clear blue.

1556
01:41:16,711 --> 01:41:17,711
I walked along the long, empty beach and watched
the white waves as they came up onto the sand,

1557
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:18,711
I felt full of life and as I walked along,
I forgot all of my worries.

1558
01:41:18,711 --> 01:41:19,711
At first, I was alone on the beach, but as
the sun rose higher in the sky, I saw that

1559
01:41:19,711 --> 01:41:20,711
a few people had appeared.

1560
01:41:20,711 --> 01:41:21,711
There were now several figures ahead of me
exercising horses or taking dogs for a walk.

1561
01:41:21,711 --> 01:41:22,711
As I approached the end of the beach I heard
a dog bark behind me, then suddenly a small

1562
01:41:22,711 --> 01:41:23,711
animal came running round in front of me and
stopped right at my feet.

1563
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:24,711
It was Snap - the rough little dog that had
been mine at Horton Lodge!

1564
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:25,711
I called his name and he jumped up into my
arms, I was so pleased to see him and he was

1565
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:26,711
clearly excited to see me.

1566
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:27,711
But how had he got here?

1567
01:41:27,711 --> 01:41:28,711
He could not have come so far on his own,
so I looked to see who he might be with.

1568
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:29,711
I turned around and saw...

1569
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:30,711
Mr Weston!

1570
01:41:30,711 --> 01:41:31,711
'Your dog remembers you well, Miss Grey,'
he said warmly, 'You must get up very early.'

1571
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:32,711
'Not often as early as this,' I said, still
very much surprised to see both Mr Weston

1572
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:33,711
and Snap.

1573
01:41:33,711 --> 01:41:34,711
'I imagine you must live quite close to the
beach, then.

1574
01:41:34,711 --> 01:41:35,711
In what part of the town do you live?' he
asked.

1575
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:36,711
'I never managed to find out.'

1576
01:41:36,711 --> 01:41:37,711
Never managed to find out?

1577
01:41:37,711 --> 01:41:38,711
Had he been looking for me, then?

1578
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:39,711
I felt my heart jump in my chest.

1579
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:40,711
Then I remembered that he had asked me a question,
so I told him where our house was.

1580
01:41:40,711 --> 01:41:41,711
He asked if the school was doing well, I told
him that several more pupils had come to join

1581
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:42,711
the school since the new year had started
and that we were doing very well.

1582
01:41:42,711 --> 01:41:43,711
'People must have heard that you are a very
good teacher, then,' he said.

1583
01:41:43,711 --> 01:41:44,711
'No, it is my mother they have heard about,'
I replied, 'she works very hard and manages

1584
01:41:44,711 --> 01:41:45,711
things so well.

1585
01:41:45,711 --> 01:41:46,711
And she is so active, clever and kind.'

1586
01:41:46,711 --> 01:41:47,711
'I would like to meet your mother.

1587
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:48,711
Will you introduce me to her one day if I
come to your house?' he asked.

1588
01:41:48,711 --> 01:41:49,711
'Yes, of course I will,' I told him.

1589
01:41:49,711 --> 01:41:50,711
'And would it be all right if I came to visit
you every now and then?'

1590
01:41:50,711 --> 01:41:51,711
Mr Weston wanted to know,

1591
01:41:51,711 --> 01:41:52,711
'Yes, I don't think my mother would mind,'
I replied.

1592
01:41:52,711 --> 01:41:53,711
We turned and started to walk back along the
beach together.

1593
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:54,711
'You haven't asked me why I have come to Scarborough,'
he said after a few moments' silence.

1594
01:41:54,711 --> 01:41:55,711
'Surely you can't think that I am rich enough
to be here on holiday.'

1595
01:41:55,711 --> 01:41:56,711
'Well, I heard that you had left Horton,'
I said.

1596
01:41:56,711 --> 01:41:57,711
'But you hadn't heard that I am the new vicar
of a parish just two miles from here?' he

1597
01:41:57,711 --> 01:41:58,711
asked.

1598
01:41:58,711 --> 01:41:59,711
'No,' I said.

1599
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:00,711
'I don't receive much news from Horton.

1600
01:42:00,711 --> 01:42:01,711
Well then, congratulations!

1601
01:42:01,711 --> 01:42:02,711
I very much hope that you like your new parish
and your new job.'

1602
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:03,711
'I think I will like it more in a year or
two,' he said, 'when I have made some of the

1603
01:42:03,711 --> 01:42:04,711
changes there that I think are needed.

1604
01:42:04,711 --> 01:42:05,711
It is certainly wonderful to have a parish
all to myself with nobody to disagree with

1605
01:42:05,711 --> 01:42:06,711
me and tell me how I should do things differently.

1606
01:42:06,711 --> 01:42:07,711
Of course, he was talking about Mr Hatfield.

1607
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:08,711
Then he added, 'And I am lucky enough to have
a nice house in a good area and a salary of

1608
01:42:08,711 --> 01:42:09,711
three hundred pounds a year.

1609
01:42:09,711 --> 01:42:10,711
In fact, I have nothing but loneliness to
complain about.

1610
01:42:10,711 --> 01:42:11,711
And there is nothing I could wish for apart
from someone to share all of that with.'

1611
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:12,711
He looked directly at me as he spoke these
last few words and I felt my cheeks go red.

1612
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:13,711
I felt embarrassed.

1613
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:14,711
'Oh, I'm sure that when you are well known
in your new parish,' I said quickly, 'there

1614
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:15,711
will be many women there who will be keen
to share that life with you.'

1615
01:42:15,711 --> 01:42:16,711
'I am not so presumptuous as to expect there
will be a lot of women who want to marry me,'

1616
01:42:16,711 --> 01:42:17,711
he said.

1617
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:18,711
'But even if there were so many, I am looking
for a very special type of person to share

1618
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:19,711
my life with.

1619
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:20,711
Perhaps I wouldn't find that person among
the ladies of my parish.'

1620
01:42:20,711 --> 01:42:21,711
'If you are looking for perfection - to find
someone who has no faults at all,' I told

1621
01:42:21,711 --> 01:42:22,711
him, 'then I don't think you will ever find
that person.'

1622
01:42:22,711 --> 01:42:23,711
'No, I am not looking for perfection,' he
replied.

1623
01:42:23,711 --> 01:42:24,711
'I have no right to because I am certainly
not perfect myself.'

1624
01:42:24,711 --> 01:42:25,711
We had reached the town now and before we
walked up the bank onto the street, he offered

1625
01:42:25,711 --> 01:42:26,711
me his arm to support me.

1626
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:27,711
I put my arm in his.

1627
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:28,711
Once we were in the street the horses, carriages
and men moving around us made it difficult

1628
01:42:28,711 --> 01:42:29,711
to talk.

1629
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:30,711
We walked in silence for a few minutes, arm
in arm, before he spoke again.

1630
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:31,711
'You don't often go down to the beach, do
you?' he said.

1631
01:42:31,711 --> 01:42:32,711
'I have walked there many times since I have
come here.

1632
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:33,711
I have come both morning and evening and I
have never seen you until now.

1633
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:34,711
And I have looked for your school as I have
walked about the town, but have never found

1634
01:42:34,711 --> 01:42:35,711
it.

1635
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:36,711
Once or twice I asked if anyone knew of the
school, but no one could tell me where the

1636
01:42:36,711 --> 01:42:37,711
house was.'

1637
01:42:37,711 --> 01:42:38,711
He walked with me to the end of the street
where I lived.

1638
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:39,711
'I'll leave you here, Miss Grey,' he said
kindly.

1639
01:42:39,711 --> 01:42:40,711
'And when will you come to meet my mother?'

1640
01:42:40,711 --> 01:42:41,711
I asked him.

1641
01:42:41,711 --> 01:42:42,711
'I hope to come tomorrow,' he told me.

1642
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:43,711
He said goodbye and then called Snap to him.

1643
01:42:43,711 --> 01:42:44,711
The dog did not know which one of us he should
follow.

1644
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:45,711
'I'm afraid I won't offer to give him back
to you,' said Mr Weston, smiling, 'because

1645
01:42:45,711 --> 01:42:46,711
I like him.'

1646
01:42:46,711 --> 01:42:47,711
'Oh, I am happy not to have him,' I replied.

1647
01:42:47,711 --> 01:42:48,711
'Now that I know he has a very good owner
I won't need to worry about him anymore.'

1648
01:42:48,711 --> 01:42:49,711
'You believe that I am a very good owner then?'
he said and smiled again before walking away.

1649
01:42:49,711 --> 01:42:50,711
I returned home full of happiness.

1650
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:51,711
I had been given another chance and I hoped
that this time I would be lucky.

1651
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:52,711
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
The Happy Ending

1652
01:42:52,711 --> 01:42:53,711
'Well, Agnes, you must not take such a long
walk again before breakfast,' said my mother.

1653
01:42:53,711 --> 01:42:54,711
'Are you feeling ill?'

1654
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:55,711
She had seen that I had drunk an extra cup
of coffee but had eaten nothing, I told her

1655
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:56,711
that I just did not feel hungry because I
was hot and tired after my walk.

1656
01:42:56,711 --> 01:42:57,711
The truth was that I was too busy thinking
about how to tell my mother about Mr Weston

1657
01:42:57,711 --> 01:42:58,711
to think of eating.

1658
01:42:58,711 --> 01:42:59,711
If he was coming to visit the next day, then
I had to tell her that I had met him on the

1659
01:42:59,711 --> 01:43:00,711
beach.

1660
01:43:00,711 --> 01:43:01,711
I waited until breakfast had been taken away
and until I had calmed down a little.

1661
01:43:01,711 --> 01:43:02,711
Then, once I had sat down and started to do
some drawing, I began...

1662
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:03,711
'I bumped into an old friend on the beach,
mother,' I said.

1663
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:04,711
'An old friend?'

1664
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:05,711
she said, 'Who on earth could that be?'

1665
01:43:05,711 --> 01:43:06,711
'Two old friends, in fact,' I told her, 'One
was a dog,' and then I reminded her of Snap,

1666
01:43:06,711 --> 01:43:07,711
who I had told her about in my letters from
Horton Lodge.

1667
01:43:07,711 --> 01:43:08,711
I now told her how he had suddenly appeared
on the beach and had run to me.

1668
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:09,711
'And the other friend,' I continued, 'was
Mr Weston, the curate of Horton.'

1669
01:43:09,711 --> 01:43:10,711
'Mr Weston?

1670
01:43:10,711 --> 01:43:11,711
I've never heard of him before,' my mother
said.

1671
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:12,711
'Yes, you have,' I corrected her, 'I've mentioned
him several times, I think, but you don't

1672
01:43:12,711 --> 01:43:13,711
remember.'

1673
01:43:13,711 --> 01:43:14,711
'I've heard you talk about Mr Hatfield,' she
told me.

1674
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:15,711
'Mr Hatfield was the vicar and Mr Weston was
the curate.

1675
01:43:15,711 --> 01:43:16,711
Anyway, he was on the beach this morning with
the dog - he must have bought it from someone

1676
01:43:16,711 --> 01:43:17,711
in the village at Horton.

1677
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:18,711
We talked for a little while after the dog
had found me.

1678
01:43:18,711 --> 01:43:19,711
He asked about our school and how well it
was doing.

1679
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:20,711
I told him it was doing very well thanks to
your clever management.

1680
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:21,711
When I mentioned you, he said that he would
like to meet you.

1681
01:43:21,711 --> 01:43:22,711
Then he asked if I would introduce you to
him, if he happened to come by and visit tomorrow.

1682
01:43:22,711 --> 01:43:23,711
So I said that I would.

1683
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:24,711
Was it all right for me to say that?'

1684
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:25,711
'Of course,' replied my mother, 'What type
of man is he?'

1685
01:43:25,711 --> 01:43:26,711
'He is a very good man, I think, but you will
meet him yourself tomorrow,' I told her.

1686
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:27,711
'He is the new vicar in a village just two
miles from here and he has only been in that

1687
01:43:27,711 --> 01:43:28,711
parish for a few weeks.

1688
01:43:28,711 --> 01:43:29,711
I imagine that he has not yet made any new
friends and would like some company.'

1689
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:30,711
I spent the next morning feeling nervous and
excited while I waited for him to come.

1690
01:43:30,711 --> 01:43:31,711
He finally came at noon.

1691
01:43:31,711 --> 01:43:32,711
Having introduced him to my mother, I moved
away to the other side of the room to carry

1692
01:43:32,711 --> 01:43:33,711
on with my drawing while they talked.

1693
01:43:33,711 --> 01:43:34,711
They got on extremely well together.

1694
01:43:34,711 --> 01:43:35,711
I was so pleased because I had been worried
about what my mother would think of him.

1695
01:43:35,711 --> 01:43:36,711
He did not stay long that time, but when he
left, she said she would be happy to see him

1696
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:37,711
whenever he found the time to visit us again.

1697
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:38,711
After he had left, she said to me, 'Well,
I think he is a very sensible man.

1698
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:39,711
But why did you sit over there, Agnes?

1699
01:43:39,711 --> 01:43:40,711
And why didn't you join in with the conversation?'

1700
01:43:40,711 --> 01:43:41,711
'I didn't join in because you were having
a good conversation and did not seem to need

1701
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:42,711
any help from me,' I explained.

1702
01:43:42,711 --> 01:43:43,711
'And anyway, he had come to see you, not me.'

1703
01:43:43,711 --> 01:43:44,711
After that, Mr Weston often came to visit
us.

1704
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:45,711
As it was the summer holidays and my mother
and I were not teaching, he could come at

1705
01:43:45,711 --> 01:43:46,711
any time during the day.

1706
01:43:46,711 --> 01:43:47,711
When he came he spoke mostly to my mother,
but I did not mind that.

1707
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:48,711
She loved to talk and I was happy to sit and
listen to the two people I loved most in the

1708
01:43:48,711 --> 01:43:49,711
world.

1709
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:50,711
Formality was quickly forgotten and Mr Weston
began to call me 'Agnes' instead of 'Miss

1710
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:51,711
Grey'.

1711
01:43:51,711 --> 01:43:52,711
The days when he did not visit seemed long
and very dull but I always had his next visit

1712
01:43:52,711 --> 01:43:53,711
to look forward to.

1713
01:43:53,711 --> 01:43:54,711
One evening, near the end of the summer holidays,
he came to the house and asked me to go for

1714
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:55,711
a walk with him.

1715
01:43:55,711 --> 01:43:56,711
He wanted to show me the wonderful view over
the sea from a nearby hill.

1716
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:57,711
With my mother's permission, I agreed to go
and went upstairs to get ready.

1717
01:43:57,711 --> 01:43:58,711
I took a little longer than usual.

1718
01:43:58,711 --> 01:43:59,711
When we left the house a few minutes later,
I put my arm into his and we went through

1719
01:43:59,711 --> 01:44:00,711
the busy streets of the town.

1720
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:01,711
As we walked quickly, along he said very little
and I began to think that something was wrong.

1721
01:44:01,711 --> 01:44:02,711
But as we came out of the town he slowed down
a little and he seemed cheerful again,

1722
01:44:02,711 --> 01:44:03,711
'I'm sorry Agnes,' he said, 'I think that
I have been walking too fast for you.

1723
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:04,711
I was keen to get out of the town but we can
walk as slowly as you wish now.

1724
01:44:04,711 --> 01:44:05,711
I think there is going to be a wonderful sunset.'

1725
01:44:05,711 --> 01:44:06,711
We walked in silence up the hill for a few
minutes before he spoke again.

1726
01:44:06,711 --> 01:44:07,711
'It is still quite lonely in my house,' he
said and smiled at me.

1727
01:44:07,711 --> 01:44:08,711
'And I have now met all of the ladies in my
parish and quite a few in this town, too.

1728
01:44:08,711 --> 01:44:09,711
But I'm not interested in any of them.

1729
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:10,711
In fact, there is only one person in the world
that I want to share my life with... and that

1730
01:44:10,711 --> 01:44:11,711
person is you, Miss Grey.

1731
01:44:11,711 --> 01:44:12,711
Agnes, will you marry me?'

1732
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:13,711
'Are you serious, Mr Weston?'

1733
01:44:13,711 --> 01:44:14,711
I asked him, because I could not believe what
I had heard.

1734
01:44:14,711 --> 01:44:15,711
'Serious!' he cried, 'How could you think
that I would joke about something like this?'

1735
01:44:15,711 --> 01:44:16,711
He put his hand gently over mine as it rested
on his arm; he must have felt that I was feeling

1736
01:44:16,711 --> 01:44:17,711
nervous.

1737
01:44:17,711 --> 01:44:18,711
'I hope that I have not shocked you,' he said
in a serious way looking at me closely, 'You

1738
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:19,711
must have known that I am not the sort of
man to flatter you all the time and talk romantic

1739
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:20,711
nonsense.

1740
01:44:20,711 --> 01:44:21,711
I hoped that you would know that a single
look or a single word of mine meant more than

1741
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:22,711
the many things that most other men use to
flirt with women.'

1742
01:44:22,711 --> 01:44:23,711
I said nothing for a moment.

1743
01:44:23,711 --> 01:44:24,711
Many thoughts were going through my head.

1744
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:25,711
'So, what is your answer?' he asked me.

1745
01:44:25,711 --> 01:44:26,711
'But what about my mother,' I said nervously,
'I'm not sure I could leave her to run the

1746
01:44:26,711 --> 01:44:27,711
school on her own.'

1747
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,711
'You don't need to worry about that,' he told
me gently.

1748
01:44:28,711 --> 01:44:29,711
'While you were getting ready to come out
for this walk I talked to your mother.

1749
01:44:29,711 --> 01:44:30,711
She said that she would be happy for you to
marry me if that's what you wanted to do.

1750
01:44:30,711 --> 01:44:31,711
I also suggested to her, in case you said
yes, that she could come and live with us,

1751
01:44:31,711 --> 01:44:32,711
I thought that you would like that.

1752
01:44:32,711 --> 01:44:33,711
But she refused and said that she could now
afford to employ an assistant to help her

1753
01:44:33,711 --> 01:44:34,711
teach the pupils.

1754
01:44:34,711 --> 01:44:35,711
So, you can see that your mother will be fine.

1755
01:44:35,711 --> 01:44:36,711
Is there anything else that you are worried
about?'

1756
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:37,711
'No,' I said, 'no, there isn't.'

1757
01:44:37,711 --> 01:44:38,711
'Do you love me then?' he asked, holding my
hand tightly in his.

1758
01:44:38,711 --> 01:44:39,711
'Yes,' I replied.

1759
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:40,711
'Yes, and I will be very happy to marry you!'

1760
01:44:40,711 --> 01:44:41,711
And here I will stop writing.

1761
01:44:41,711 --> 01:44:42,711
My diary, in which I used to write these chapters,
does not continue any further.

1762
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:43,711
I will just say that I will never forget that
wonderful summer evening.

1763
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:44,711
I will always remember how we stood and watched
that beautiful sunset together.

1764
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:45,711
My heart was filled with so much love and
happiness that I could not have imagined being

1765
01:44:45,711 --> 01:44:46,711
any happier.

1766
01:44:46,711 --> 01:44:47,711
A few weeks after that, once my mother had
found an assistant to help her at the school,

1767
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:48,711
I married Edward Weston, And I am so pleased
that I did.

1768
01:44:48,711 --> 01:44:49,711
We have had difficult times and we know that
we will have more, but we deal with them welt

1769
01:44:49,711 --> 01:44:50,711
together.

1770
01:44:50,711 --> 01:44:51,711
We try to make the most of life and we enjoy
each other's company.

1771
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:52,711
Edward has made some surprising changes in
his parish.

1772
01:44:52,711 --> 01:44:53,711
He is a good man and the people there love
and respect him.

1773
01:44:53,711 --> 01:44:54,711
Whatever his faults are as a man (and of course,
everybody has their faults) no one could say

1774
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:55,711
that he is not a good vicar, husband or father.

1775
01:44:55,711 --> 01:44:56,711
Our children, Edward, Agnes and little Mary,
are doing well.

1776
01:44:56,711 --> 01:44:57,711
At the moment they are mostly taught by me
and I try to give them as much love and care

1777
01:44:57,711 --> 01:44:58,711
as a mother can.

1778
01:44:58,711 --> 01:44:59,711
Edward's salary is more than enough for what
we need.

1779
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:00,711
We try to be careful with the money we have.

1780
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:01,711
In this way, we live a comfortable life and
manage to save a little which we will give

1781
01:45:01,711 --> 01:45:02,711
to our children when they leave home.

1782
01:45:02,711 --> 01:45:03,711
We even have enough left to give something
to others who might need it.

1783
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:04,711
I am grateful for the life that I have led
so far.

1784
01:45:04,711 --> 01:45:05,711
It is not the life of big houses and expensive
parties that other people may have, but I

1785
01:45:05,711 --> 01:45:06,711
think of myself as being lucky.

1786
01:45:06,711 --> 01:45:07,711
And now I will end my story, because you can
now easily imagine how I might happily spend

1787
01:45:07,711 --> 01:45:08,711
the years that I have left to live.

1788
01:45:08,711 --> 01:45:08,713
- THE END -
