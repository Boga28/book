1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,560
The Irish are said to be good at parties, noisy 
revels with drinking, singing, and dancing late  

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:20,480
into the night. But Mary, seventeen and living 
on a lonely farm, has no experience of them,  

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
and as she cycles down the mountain 
road to her first party in the town,  

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:43,840
she is full of hopes and 
dreams and expectations...

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:07,520
Mary hoped that the ancient front tyre on the 
bicycle would burst. Twice she had to stop to put  

6
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,120
more air in it, which was very annoying. For 
as long as she could remember, she had been  

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,800
putting air in tyres, carrying firewood, 
cleaning out the cow shed, doing a man's work.  

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,800
Her father and two brothers 
worked for the forestry company,  

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,680
so she and her mother had to do everything, 
and there were three children to take care  

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,960
of as well. Theirs was a mountainy 
farm in Ireland, and life was hard.

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,160
But this cold evening in early November she 
was free. She rode her bicycle along the road,  

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,400
thinking pleasantly about the party. Although 
she was seventeen, this was her first  

13
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:13,600
party. The invitation had come only that morning 
from Mrs Rodgers, owner of the Commercial Hotel.  

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,880
At first her mother did not wish Mary to go; 
there was too much to be done, soup to be made,  

15
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
and one of the children had earache 
and was likely to cry in the night.  

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
But Mary begged her mother to let her go.

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:42,160
'What use would it be?' her mother said. To her, 
all such excitements were bad for you, because  

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,120
they gave you a taste of something you 
couldn't have. But finally she agreed.

19
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
'You can go as long as you're back in 
time to milk the cows in the morning,  

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,240
and don't do anything foolish,' she said. Mary was 
going to stay the night in town with Mrs Rodgers.  

21
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,400
She had washed and brushed her hair, which 
fell in long dark waves over her shoulders.  

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,560
She was allowed to wear the black evening 
dress that an uncle had sent from America  

23
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,480
years ago. Her mother said 
a prayer to keep her safe,  

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,360
took her to the top of the farm road, warned 
her never to touch alcohol, and said goodbye.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,160
Mary felt happy as she rode along slowly, avoiding 
the holes in the road, which were covered with  

26
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,240
thin ice. It had been very cold all day. At the 
bottom of the hill she got off and looked back,  

27
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,760
out of habit, at her house. It was the 
only one on the mountain, small and white,  

28
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,320
with a piece of land at the back which 
they called the vegetable garden.  

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:03,360
She looked away. She was now free to think of 
John Roland. He had appeared two years before,  

30
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,120
riding a motorbike daringly fast, and stopped 
to ask the way. He was staying at the Commercial  

31
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Hotel and had come up to see the lake, which was 
famous for the way it changed colour at different  

32
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,640
times of day. When the sun went down, the water 
was often a strange reddish-purple, like wine.

33
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,520
'Down there,' she said to the stranger, 
pointing to the lake below. Rocky hills  

34
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,920
and tiny fields of bare earth dropped 
steeply towards the water. It was midsummer  

35
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,640
and very hot; the grass was tall and there were 
wild flowers, blood-red, close to their feet.

36
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
'What an unusual sight,' he 
said, looking at the lake.

37
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,240
She had no interest in views herself. She 
just looked up at the high sky and saw that  

38
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,800
a bird had stopped in the air above them. It was 
like a pause in her life, the bird above them,  

39
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,200
perfectly still. Then her mother 
came out to see who the stranger was.  

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,920
He introduced himself, very politely, 
as John Roland, an English painter.

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,000
She did not remember exactly how it happened,  

42
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,760
but after a while he walked into their 
kitchen with them and sat down to tea.

43
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,400
Two long years had passed since that day, 
but she had never stopped hoping. Perhaps  

44
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,400
this evening she would see him. The postman had 
said someone special in the hotel expected her.  

45
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,720
It seemed to her that her happiness somehow 
lit up the greyness of the cold sky,  

46
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,440
the icy fields going blue in the night, the 
dark windows of the small houses she passed.  

47
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Suddenly her parents were rich and cheerful,  

48
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,760
her little sister had no earache, the kitchen 
fire did not smoke. Sometimes she smiled at  

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
the thought of how she would appear to him 
- taller and more womanly now, in a dress  

50
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:25,440
that could be worn anywhere. She forgot about the 
ancient tyre, jumped on the bicycle and rode on.

51
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,440
The five street lights were on 
when she entered the small town.  

52
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,960
There had been a cattle market that 
day, and drunken farmers with sticks  

53
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,040
were still trying to find their own 
cattle in dark corners of the main street.

54
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
As she reached the Commercial Hotel, 
Mary heard loud conversation inside,  

55
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,600
and men singing in the bar. She didn't 
want to go in through the front door,  

56
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,480
in case someone saw her and told her 
father she'd gone into the public bar.  

57
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,200
So she went to the back door. It was 
open, but she knocked before entering.

58
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,440
Two girls rushed to the door. One was Doris 
O'Beirne. She was famous for being the only  

59
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,320
Doris in the whole town, and for the fact that 
one of her eyes was blue and the other dark brown.

60
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,160
'God, I thought it was someone important,' 
she said when she saw Mary standing there,  

61
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,400
blushing, pretty, and with a bottle of cream 
in her hand. Another girl! There were far too  

62
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,000
many girls in the town. Girls like Mary 
with matching eyes and long wavy hair.

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,960
'Come in, or stay out,' said Eithne Duggan, 
the second girl, to Mary. It was supposed  

64
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,840
to be a joke but neither of the town girls 
liked Mary. They hated shy mountainy people.

65
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,320
Mary came in, carrying the cream, which 
her mother had sent to Mrs Rodgers  

66
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,840
as a present. She put it on the table and took 
off her coat. The girls whispered to each other  

67
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,000
and giggled when they saw her dress. The 
kitchen smelt of cattle and fried food.

68
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,400
Mrs Rodgers came in from the bar to speak to her.

69
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,960
'Mary, I'm glad you came, these two girls 
are no use at all, always giggling. Now  

70
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,120
the first thing to do is to move the heavy 
furniture out of the sitting room upstairs,  

71
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
but not the piano. We're going 
to have dancing and everything.'

72
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,840
Quickly Mary realized she 
was being given work to do,  

73
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,000
and she blushed with shock and disappointment. 
She thought of her good black dress and how her  

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
mother wouldn't even let her wear it to church 
on Sundays. She might tear it or dirty it.

75
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,200
'And then we have to start cooking the 
goose,' Mrs Rodgers said, and went on to  

76
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,040
explain that the party was for Mr Brogan, the 
local Customs Officer, who was leaving his job.

77
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
'There's someone here expecting me,'  

78
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,720
Mary said, trembling with the pleasure of being 
about to hear his name spoken by someone else.  

79
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
She wondered which room was his, and if 
he was likely to be in at that moment.  

80
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,360
Already in her imagination she was knocking 
on his door, and could hear him inside.

81
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:50,720
'Expecting you!' Mrs Rodgers said, looking 
puzzled for a moment. 'Oh, that young man from  

82
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,920
the factory was asking about you - he said he 
saw you at a dance once. A strange one, he is.'

83
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,280
'What man?' Mary said, as she felt the 
happiness leaking out of her heart.

84
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,240
But Mrs Rodgers heard the men in the bar 
shouting for her to refill their empty glasses,  

85
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
and she hurried out without replying.

86
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
Upstairs Doris and Eithne helped Mary move 
the heavy furniture out of the sitting room.  

87
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,800
The two town girls shared jokes with each 
other, giggled at Mary behind her back,  

88
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,560
and ordered her around like a servant. She dusted 
the piano and cleaned the floor. She'd come for a  

89
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,360
party! She wished she were at home - at least 
with cattle and chickens it was clean dirt.

90
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,240
Then Eithne and Doris told 
Mary to get the glasses ready,  

91
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,560
and they went away to drink a secret 
bottle of beer in the bathroom.

92
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,400
'She's crying like a baby in 
there,' Eithne told Doris, giggling.

93
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,840
'God, she looks an eejit 
in that dress,' Doris said.

94
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,720
'It's her mother's,' Eithne said.

95
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
'What's she crying about?' wondered Doris.

96
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,840
'She thought some boy would be here. 
Do you remember that boy who stayed  

97
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
here the summer before last, with a motorbike?'

98
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,120
'The boy with the big nose?' said Doris. 
'God, she'd frighten him in that dress.  

99
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
Her hair isn't natural, either.'

100
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,480
'I hate that kind of long black hair,' 
Eithne said, drinking the last of the beer.  

101
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,680
They hid the bottle under the bath.

102
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,840
In the room with the piano Mary got the 
glasses ready. Tears ran down her face,  

103
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,040
so she did not put on the light. She saw what the 
party would be like. They would eat the goose, the  

104
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,840
men would get drunk and the girls would giggle. 
They would dance and sing and tell ghost stories,  

105
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,600
and in the morning she would have to get up early 
and be home in time for milking. She looked out of  

106
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,480
the small window at the dirty street, remembering 
how once she had danced with John on the farm road  

107
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,880
to no music at all, just their hearts 
beating, and the sound of happiness.

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,960
On that first day at tea, her father had 
suggested that John should stay with them,  

109
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,400
and he stayed for four days, helping with the 
farm work and the farm machinery. Mary made  

110
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,840
his bed in the morning and carried up a bowl of 
rainwater every evening, so that he could wash.  

111
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,920
She washed his shirt, and that day his bare back 
burnt in the sun. She put milk on it. It was his  

112
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,480
last day with them. After supper he gave each 
of the older children a ride on the motorbike.  

113
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,400
She would never forget that ride. She felt 
warm from head to foot in wonder and delight.  

114
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,960
The sun went down, and wild flowers shone yellow 
in the grass. They did not talk as they rode;  

115
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,320
she had her arms round his stomach, with the 
delicate and desperate hold of a girl in love.  

116
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,400
However far they went, they always 
seemed to be riding into a golden mist.  

117
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,640
The lake was at its most beautiful. They stopped 
at the bridge and sat on a low stone wall.  

118
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
She took an insect off his neck and touched 
the skin where there was a tiny drop of blood.  

119
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,880
It was then that they danced, to the sound 
of singing birds and running water. The air  

120
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,280
was sweet with the smell of the grass in the 
fields, lying green and ungathered. They danced.

121
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:03,120
'Sweet Mary,' he said, looking seriously into 
her brown eyes. 'I cannot love you because  

122
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,120
I already have a wife and children to love. 
Anyway, you are too young and too innocent.'

123
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,240
Next day, as he was leaving, he asked if 
he could send her something in the post.  

124
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,680
It came eleven days later - a 
black-and-white drawing of her,  

125
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,840
very like her, except that the 
girl in the drawing was uglier.

126
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,360
'That's no good for anything!' said her mother, 
who had been expecting a gold bracelet or  

127
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,760
necklace. They hung it on the kitchen wall for 
a while and then one day it fell down. Someone  

128
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,200
(probably her mother) used it, with a brush, for 
collecting dirt from the floor. Mary had wanted  

129
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,800
to keep it, to put it safely away in a drawer, but 
she was ashamed to. Her family were hard people,  

130
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,120
and it was only when someone died that 
they ever cried or showed much feeling.

131
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,920
'Sweet Mary,' he had said. He 
never wrote. Two summers passed.  

132
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,080
She had a feeling that he would come back, and at 
the same time a terrible fear that he might not.

133
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,560
In the upstairs room of the hotel the men were 
taking off their jackets and sitting down to eat.  

134
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,160
The girls had carried the goose up from the 
kitchen, and it lay in the center of the table.  

135
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,440
Mrs Rodgers had closed the public bar, and now 
she was cutting meat off the goose and putting  

136
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,760
it onto plates. She kept Mary busy, serving 
the potatoes and passing the food around.  

137
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,000
Mr Brogan, as chief guest, was served 
first, with the best cuts of goose.

138
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,160
Mary was surprised that people in towns seemed so 
coarse. When one of the men, Hickey, tried to take  

139
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,720
her hand, she did not smile at all. She wished 
she were at home. She knew what her family were  

140
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,800
doing there - the boys learning their lessons, 
her mother baking bread, her father rolling  

141
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,120
cigarettes and talking to himself. In another 
hour they'd say their prayers and go up to bed.  

142
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,480
The routine of their lives never changed. 
The fresh bread was always cool by morning.

143
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,520
O'Toole, the young man who worked at the factory,  

144
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,680
had bright green eyes and hair 
so blond it was almost white.

145
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,840
'No one's offered me any food yet,' 
he said. 'A nice way to behave.'

146
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
'Oh God, Mary, haven't you given 
Mr O'Toole anything to eat yet?'  

147
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,320
Mrs Rodgers said, and she gave 
Mary a push to hurry her up.  

148
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,120
Mary gave him a large plateful, and he 
thanked her, saying they'd dance later. To him  

149
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,520
she was far prettier than those good-for-nothing 
town girls - she was tall and thin like himself.

150
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,040
And he liked a simple-minded girl with long 
hair. Maybe later on he'd persuade her to go into  

151
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,560
another room, and they'd have sex. She had lovely 
eyes when you looked into them, brown and deep.

152
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,840
The fifth woman at the party was 
Crystal, the local hairdresser,  

153
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,560
who had bright red hair, and who 
did not like the undercooked goose.  

154
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,040
She and Mrs Rodgers were talking together 
when Brogan unexpectedly began to sing.

155
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,920
'Let the man sing, can't you,'  

156
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,960
O'Toole said to Doris and Eithne, who 
were giggling over a private joke.

157
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,080
Mary felt cold in her thin dress. There 
hadn't been a fire in that room for years,  

158
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
and the air had not warmed up yet.

159
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,720
'Would any of the ladies 
care to sing?' asked O'Toole,  

160
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,280
when Brogan finished. 'I'm sure 
you can sing,' he said to Mary.

161
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,160
'Where she comes from, they can 
only just talk,' Doris said.

162
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,480
Mary blushed. She said nothing, but she felt 
angry. Her family ate with a knife and fork,  

163
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,240
she thought proudly, and had a cloth on the 
kitchen table, not a plastic one like this,  

164
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,520
and kept a tin of coffee in the cupboard 
in case strangers came to the door.

165
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
'Christ, boys, we forgot the soup!'  

166
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Mrs Rodgers said suddenly, and hurried out 
with Doris to fetch it from the kitchen.

167
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,240
After the soup, O'Toole poured out four glasses 
of whiskey, making sure that the level in each  

168
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,200
glass was the same. There were bottles of 
beer as well. The ladies had gin and orange.

169
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,240
'Orange for me,' said Mary, but when her back 
was turned, O'Toole put gin in her orange.  

170
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
They all raised their glasses 
and drank to Brogan's future.  

171
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,200
Long John Salmon, the fourth man at the 
party, asked Brogan about his plans,  

172
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,920
and Brogan began to talk about the things 
he wanted to do to his house and garden.

173
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,840
'Come on, someone, tell us a joke,' said Hickey 
after a while. He was bored with gardening talk.

174
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
'I'll tell you a joke,' said Long John Salmon.

175
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
'Is it a funny joke?' Brogan asked.

176
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,520
'It's about my brother 
Patrick,' Long John Salmon said.

177
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,680
'Not that old thing again,' said 
Hickey and O'Toole, together.

178
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,200
'Oh, let him tell it,' said Mrs 
Rodgers, who had never heard it.

179
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Long John Salmon told a story 
about his brother, who died,  

180
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,000
but came back a month later as a ghost, 
walking through walls and around the yard.

181
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,520
'Ah God, let's have a bit of music,' said Hickey, 
who had heard that story nine or ten times.  

182
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,680
It had neither a beginning, a middle, nor an end.

183
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,160
They put a record on, and 
O'Toole asked Mary to dance.  

184
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,960
Brogan and Mrs Rodgers were dancing too, and 
Crystal said that she'd dance if anyone asked her.

185
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:36,800
Mary felt strange - her head was going round and 
round, and in her stomach there was a nice feeling  

186
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,840
that made her want to lie back and stretch her 
legs. A new feeling that frightened her. O'Toole  

187
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,040
danced her right out of the room and into the 
cold passage beyond, where he kissed her clumsily.

188
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,800
Inside the room, Crystal had begun to cry, 
sitting at the table with her head on her arms.  

189
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:10,560
Gin and orange always made her cry. 'Hickey, there 
is no happiness in life,' she cried bitterly.

190
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,840
'What happiness?' said 
Hickey, who was full of drink.

191
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,680
Doris and Eithne sat on either side of Long John 
Salmon, talking sweetly to him. He was a strange  

192
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:32,080
man, but he owned a large fruit farm and he was 
still single. Brogan, breathless from dancing,  

193
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,720
was now sitting down, with Mrs Rodgers 
sitting on his knees. The record finished,  

194
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,080
and Mary ran in from the dark passage, away 
from O'Toole, who followed her in, laughing.

195
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,200
O'Toole was the first to cause trouble.  

196
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,080
He became offended when Mrs Rodgers 
prevented him from telling a rude joke.

197
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,160
'Think of the girls,' Mrs Rodgers said.

198
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
'Girls!' O'Toole said nastily.  

199
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
He picked up the bottle of cream and poured 
it over the few remaining bits of goose.

200
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,840
'Christ, man!' Hickey said, 
taking the bottle of cream away.

201
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Mrs Rodgers said it was time everyone went to 
bed, as the party seemed to be over. All the  

202
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,840
guests were staying the night at the hotel. 
The four girls were going to share one room.

203
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,200
In the bedroom, Mary sighed. Before they could 
go to bed, they had to move the heavy furniture  

204
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,320
back to the sitting room. She could hear 
O'Toole shouting and singing in another room.  

205
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,240
There had been gin in her orange, she 
knew now, because she could smell it on  

206
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,760
her breath. She had broken her promise to 
her mother; it would bring her bad luck.

207
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,520
'Ah girls, girls,' O'Toole said, 
pushing their bedroom door open.  

208
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
'Where's my lovely Mary? 
Come out here with me, Mary!'

209
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
'Go to bed, you're tired,' Mary said.  

210
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,760
He caught her hand and started trying to 
drag her out of the room. She let out a cry.

211
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,960
'I'll throw this flowerpot at you if you don't 
leave the girl alone,' Eithne called out.

212
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:24,240
'Stupid cows, the lot of you!' said O'Toole, but 
he dropped Mary's hand and took a step backwards.  

213
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,760
The girls rushed to shut the door and push 
a heavy chest against it, to keep him out.

214
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,840
They all got into the one big bed, 
two at the top and two at the bottom.  

215
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
Mary was glad to have the other girls with her.

216
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,280
'I was at a party. Now I 
know what parties are like,'  

217
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,200
she said to herself, as she tried to force herself 
to sleep. She heard a sound of water running,  

218
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,640
but it did not seem to be raining outside. 
At sunrise she woke up. She had to get home  

219
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,040
in time for milking, so she put on her 
dress and shoes and went downstairs.

220
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,440
There was a strong smell of beer. Someone, 
probably O'Toole, had turned on the taps in the  

221
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:22,000
bar, and beer had flowed out of the bar and into 
the kitchen. Mrs Rodgers would kill somebody. Mary  

222
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,760
picked her way carefully across the room to the 
door. She left without even making a cup of tea.

223
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,360
She found her bicycle, but the front tyre was 
flat, so she walked rapidly, pushing the bicycle.  

224
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,680
The frost lay on the sleeping windows and roofs.  

225
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,840
It had magically made the dirty streets look 
white and clean. She did not feel tired,  

226
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,920
but simply pleased to be outside, as she 
breathed in the beauty of the morning.

227
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Mrs Rodgers woke at eight and 
got out of Brogan's warm bed.  

228
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,800
She smelt disaster instantly, 
and ran to call the others.  

229
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,480
The girls were made to get up and help clean the 
floors. Hickey, who had by then come downstairs,  

230
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,640
said what a shame it was to waste good drink. 
O'Toole, the guilty one, had left early.

231
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
'And where's the girl in the 
black dress?' Hickey asked.

232
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,360
'She ran off, before we were 
up,' Doris said. They all agreed  

233
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,720
that Mary was useless and 
should never have been asked.

234
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,000
'And she was the one who encouraged O'Toole, 
and then disappointed him, so he got angry,'  

235
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,520
added Doris.

236
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
'I suppose she's home by now,' Hickey said.

237
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Mary was half a mile from home, sitting on the 
grass. If only I had a boy, someone to love,  

238
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,880
something to hold onto, she thought, as she 
broke some ice with her shoe and watched the  

239
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,720
crazy pattern it made. The poor birds could get 
no food, as the ground was frozen hard. There  

240
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,080
was frost all over Ireland, frost on the stony 
fields, and on all the ugliness of the world.

241
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,000
Walking again, she wondered if and what 
she would tell her mother and her brothers,  

242
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,040
and if all parties were as bad. She was at the 
top of the hill now, and could see her own house,  

243
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:37,840
like a little white box at the end of 
the world, waiting to receive her.
 

244
00:26:39,800 --> 00:27:12,129
- THE END -
