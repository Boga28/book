CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,349
The Clarkson family lived in the country near
Cambridge, about half a mile from the nearest

3
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:19,510
village and about a mile from the river.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:29,199
They had a big, old house with a beautiful
garden, a lot of flowers and many old trees.

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,739
One Thursday morning in July, Jackie came
in from the garden.

6
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,490
She was a tall, fat woman, thirty years old.

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:52,780
It was the hottest day of the year, but she
wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt.

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,600
She went into the kitchen to get a drink of
water.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,079
Just then the phone rang.

10
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,980
'Cambridge 1379,' Jackie said.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,210
'Hello.

12
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,900
This is Diane.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
I want to talk to Mother.'

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,840
'Mother isn't here,' Jackie said.

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,970
'She's at the doctor's.'

16
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,710
'Why?

17
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,080
What's wrong?'

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,560
'Nothing's wrong,' Jackie said.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,140
'Why are you telephoning?

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,970
You are going to come this weekend?

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,090
Mother wants everyone to be here.'

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,030
'Yes, I want to come,' Diane said.

23
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,650
'I'm phoning because I have no money for the
train ticket.'

24
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,800
'No money!

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,730
Mother is always giving you money!'

26
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:02,450
'This phone call is very expensive,' Diane
said coldly.

27
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,000
'Tell Mother please.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,399
I need the money.'

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,370
Jackie put the phone down.

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,659
She took a cigarette from her bag and began
to smoke.

31
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,340
She felt angry because her sister always asked
for money.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:29,370
Diane was twenty years old, the youngest in
the family.

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,269
She lived in London, in one room of a big
house.

34
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,730
She wanted to be a singer.

35
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:45,290
She sang very well but she could never get
work.

36
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,549
Jackie went back into the kitchen and began
to make some sandwiches.

37
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:58,230
Just then the back door opened, and her mother
came in.

38
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,780
'It's very hot!'

39
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,340
Molly said.

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,959
She took off her hat and put it down on the
table.

41
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,969
She was a tall, dark woman with beautiful
eyes.

42
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:24,409
Two big, black dogs came into the kitchen
after her and ran across to her.

43
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:29,849
She sat down and put her hands on their heads.

44
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,749
Jackie put the sandwiches on the table.

45
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:39,470
'Mother,' she said, 'Diane phoned.

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,529
She wants money for her train ticket.'

47
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:46,579
Molly closed her eyes for a minute.

48
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,790
Then she stood up.

49
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:57,469
'This afternoon I want you to get the house
ready for the weekend,' she said.

50
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:05,060
'Oh, and please go to the village later and
get my tablets.'

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,640
'Yes, Mother,' Jackie said.

52
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,870
Molly went to the door.

53
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,250
'Mother, please wait a minute,' Jackie said.

54
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,280
'Peter Hobbs came here this morning.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,750
He's very angry with you about that letter.

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,640
He lost his job, you know.

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,590
Why did you write to his office?

58
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,520
He wants to talk to you about it.'

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,810
'Well, I don't want to talk to him,' Molly
said.

60
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,810
She opened the door.

61
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,690
'But Mother, you don't understand.

62
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:55,160
He's seventeen, and it was his first job.

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,140
He's very, very angry.

64
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:06,710
He says ... he says he's going to kill you!'

65
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,880
Molly did not answer.

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,190
She went out of the room and closed the door.

67
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:28,860
CHAPTER TWO

68
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,010
It was seven o'clock on Saturday evening.

69
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,420
Jackie stood at the window.

70
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,900
A car drove slowly up to the front door and
stopped.

71
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,080
A tall man with white hair got out.

72
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,690
It was Albert, the husband of Molly's sister.

73
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,730
'Here's Uncle Albert,' Jackie said.

74
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,740
'Always late.'

75
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,930
She went out of the room and opened the front
door.

76
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,260
Albert came in and went at once to Molly.

77
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,280
'Oh, dear.

78
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,310
I'm very late.

79
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,120
I am sorry,' Albert said.

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,830
'Fifty years old today!

81
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,030
What a wonderful dress!'

82
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,640
Molly did not smile.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,520
'Thank you, Albert.

84
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
We're all getting older.'

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:46,780
Tonight she wore a long black dress, and the
two black dogs sat at her feet.

86
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,850
'Everyone is here now.

87
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,410
Let's go in to dinner,' she said.

88
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,640
Everyone stood up and went to the table.

89
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,330
'The table looks nice, Jackie.

90
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,140
What wonderful flowers!'

91
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,010
Diane said.

92
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:17,830
She was a beautiful girl, with long black
hair and dark blue eyes.

93
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,830
She wore a long red dress.

94
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,781
Albert sat down next to Roger.

95
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:30,820
Roger was Molly's son, her second child.

96
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,400
He lived in Cambridge, in an expensive house.

97
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,550
'Someone called Peter stopped me down the
road,' Albert said.

98
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,690
'Who is he?

99
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,890
He's very angry with you, Molly.'

100
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:59,720
'That's Peter Hobbs, from the house across
the road,' Jackie said quickly.

101
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,820
She looked across the table at Molly.

102
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,670
'He lost his job last week and he's angry
with everyone.'

103
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,861
'It's Molly he doesn't like,' Albert said.

104
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:14,380
Molly said nothing.

105
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,200
Everyone began to eat.

106
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,860
'How is Aunt Annie?'

107
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,170
Jackie asked.

108
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,530
'She's much worse now,' Albert said.

109
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,070
'She stays in bed all the time.

110
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,580
She needs a nurse twenty-four hours a day.'

111
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,660
'I am sorry,' Molly said.

112
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,180
Albert stopped eating and looked at Molly.

113
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,490
'It's very difficult and very expensive, you
know.

114
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:01,149
Annie feels very unhappy because you don't
visit her, Molly.

115
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,990
She loves you very much.

116
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,190
You are her little sister, you know.'

117
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,999
Molly closed her eyes for a minute.

118
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:15,120
'I know that, Albert.

119
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,680
I am fifty years old, but I am always her
"little" sister.

120
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,990
Well, we can talk about it later.'

121
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,450
Albert laughed.

122
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,730
'Oh yes, we can talk later.

123
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,050
It's always later with you, Molly.

124
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,610
Always tomorrow.

125
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,120
Never today.'

126
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,749
Jackie watched her mother.

127
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:50,699
Her mother was angry with Albert.

128
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:57,850
Molly never liked talking about her sister
Annie and she did not like visiting her because

129
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,920
she was very ill.

130
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,620
'That's a beautiful dress, Diane.

131
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,420
Is it new?'

132
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Jackie asked.

133
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,389
'Thank you, Jackie.

134
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:13,850
Yes, it's new, and very expensive.

135
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,050
I got it on Wednesday,' Diane said.

136
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,769
She smiled at Jackie.

137
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:26,730
'All your things are expensive,' Jackie said.

138
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,550
She remembered the phone call on Thursday
about the train ticket.

139
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,079
'I don't like cheap things,' Diane said.

140
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,230
'And I'm going to need more money soon.

141
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,550
I want to go to America.

142
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,300
Can you help me, Roger?'

143
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,620
'Oh no,' Roger said.

144
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,759
'Nobody wants to help you, Diane.

145
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:04,519
You don't like working, we all know that,
but we all want you to get a job.'

146
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,490
Diane laughed.

147
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,439
'It doesn't matter, Roger.

148
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,829
I don't need your help.

149
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,309
Mother always helps me.

150
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,790
Mother loves me best.'

151
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,700
She suddenly smiled, a quick, beautiful smile.

152
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,960
But her eyes were cold.

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,940
Jackie looked at her mother.

154
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,300
Molly's face was white.

155
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,529
Jackie did not understand.

156
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,589
Was her mother afraid of Diane?

157
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:47,420
Jackie wanted her mother to be happy today.

158
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,079
'Would you like some more meat, Uncle Albert?'

159
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,079
Jackie asked.

160
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,509
'Roger, can you give everyone some more to
drink?'

161
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,939
Roger got up and began to give more wine to
everyone.

162
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:09,610
'This is good wine,' he said.

163
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,990
Molly smiled for the first time.

164
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,820
'Yes, your father loved this wine.

165
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,110
He often drank it.'

166
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,930
'Yes,' Albert said, and looked at Molly.

167
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,100
'Expensive, too.'

168
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,139
'Would you like to meet Mr Briggs this weekend,
Roger?'

169
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,079
Jackie asked quickly.

170
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,180
'He's the new man at the farm.

171
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,089
He wants to meet you.'

172
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,839
'Briggs?

173
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,589
Briggs?'

174
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,800
Molly said, suddenly angry.

175
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,149
'Don't talk to me about that man.

176
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,639
I don't like him.

177
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,079
He wants half my garden for his farm.

178
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,670
He needs more land, he says.

179
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,369
I don't want him in my house.

180
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:13,680
He's always dirty and he has bad teeth.'

181
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,430
Jackie stood up and got her bag.

182
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:22,010
'Excuse me, I want a cigarette.'

183
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,540
'Cigarettes!

184
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,309
Always a cigarette in your mouth,' Molly said.

185
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,769
'I don't like it.

186
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,970
Cigarettes aren't good for you.'

187
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,839
Jackie began to smoke.

188
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,060
She felt angry but she said nothing.

189
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:50,190
She wanted her mother to be happy this evening,
but it was very difficult.

190
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,839
Roger drank some more wine.

191
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,269
'Well, Mother, perhaps Mr Briggs is right.

192
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:05,040
The garden is very big, you know,' he said.

193
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,550
'It's a lot of work for you.

194
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,540
The house is big, too.

195
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,939
You're fifty now.

196
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,559
You need to be more careful.'

197
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,110
'Roger!

198
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,980
I don't need a nurse, you know!

199
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:32,139
I work in the garden every day; I feel happy
there.'

200
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,939
Molly stood up.

201
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:39,230
'I know you all want my money.

202
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,389
You come here for a free dinner, you don't
want to see me.

203
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,790
You don't love me.

204
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:54,899
You want my house, and my money.

205
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,269
Well, you can all wait.

206
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:05,570
Nobody is getting more money from me, not
before I die!'

207
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,199
'Don't say that, Mother!'

208
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,940
Jackie cried.

209
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,059
Molly walked across the room to the door.

210
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:19,120
'I feel ill now.

211
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,250
I'm going upstairs to bed.'

212
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,879
Molly left the room.

213
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,339
Nobody moved.

214
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:38,800
'One day I'm going to kill that woman,' Diane
said quietly.

215
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,449
Roger looked at Diane but said nothing.

216
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,610
Albert moved his head slowly up and down.

217
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,610
Ill!

218
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,290
She's angry, that's all,' he said.

219
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,720
'Molly always gets angry about money.

220
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,889
Why can't she be good to her sister?

221
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:06,889
Annie's going to die soon.

222
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,149
Molly knows that.'

223
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:15,579
Jackie finished her cigarette and stood up.

224
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,139
'Would everyone like some coffee?

225
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:35,819
Come into the kitchen and let's drink it there.'

226
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,149
CHAPTER THREE

227
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:45,379
Early next morning the house was quiet.

228
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:54,199
Suddenly there was a cry from the room next
to Roger's, his mother's room.

229
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,249
Roger opened his eyes and looked at the clock.

230
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:03,559
It was nearly seven o'clock.

231
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,839
He got out of bed and opened the door quietly.

232
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:18,100
At the same time the door of his mother's
room opened and Diane came out.

233
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,079
Her face was very white.

234
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,459
'Roger!

235
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,850
It's Mother!

236
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:35,750
I brought a cup of coffee for her and I found
her dead.

237
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:43,169
She's dead... dead in her bed,' she cried.

238
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:51,100
Roger went quickly to the door of his mother's
room and looked in.

239
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,980
The window was open but the room was warm.

240
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,820
Molly was on the bed, one hand under her head.

241
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,830
Roger went across to the bed and put his hand
on her arm.

242
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,049
It was cold.

243
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:22,289
On the little table next to the bed was a
hot cup of coffee and an empty cup.

244
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:30,960
'I'm going to call the doctor,' Diane said.

245
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,659
'She's dead,' Roger said slowly.

246
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:39,030
His face, too, was white.

247
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,680
'Mother is dead!'

248
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,540
Diane walked across the room to the door.

249
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,500
'I'm going to phone the doctor,' she said
again.

250
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,390
'Wait a minute!'

251
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,890
Roger called.

252
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,260
'Let's tell the family first.'

253
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
'Family!

254
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,519
Nobody loved Mother!'

255
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,929
Diane went out and ran downstairs.

256
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:22,890
Roger slowly went downstairs after her and
stood by the telephone.

257
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,690
'Dr Pratt, this is Diane Clarkson.

258
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,769
It's my mother -she's dead.

259
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:40,629
Can you come quickly?'

260
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:44,399
Diane put the phone down.

261
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,070
'It isn't true, Roger!

262
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,980
Mother dead!

263
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,320
Daddy died last winter, and now Mother.'

264
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
Diane began to cry.

265
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,040
'Don't cry, Diane,' Roger said.

266
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:14,430
'Let's go upstairs and tell Uncle Albert and
Jackie.'

267
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,430
'No!

268
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,340
You tell them!

269
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,880
Nobody loved Mother.

270
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,490
You aren't sorry.

271
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,100
Look at you!

272
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,470
You want her money.

273
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,389
That's all.'

274
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:35,649
Roger suddenly wanted to hit Diane.

275
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,580
'Be quiet!' he said.

276
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,231
'What about you?

277
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:46,780
You didn't love Mother.

278
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,779
You wanted her money, too.

279
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,070
Don't forget that!'

280
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,519
'It's true,' Diane said.

281
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,290
'Oh, I can't stay in this house.

282
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,690
I'm going out.

283
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm going to the river with the dogs.'

284
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,870
'No,' Roger said.

285
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,980
'The doctor's coming and I want you here.'

286
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,789
Diane said nothing.

287
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:31,399
She went into the kitchen and at once the
dogs got up and came to her.

288
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:33,639
'Beautiful dogs!

289
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:41,510
Daddy loved you and Mother loved you.

290
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:46,039
Now I'm going to love you.'

291
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,179
She opened the back door and went out with
the dogs.

292
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,159
Roger did not move.

293
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:00,130
He stood by the telephone.

294
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,000
'It's true,' he thought.

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,019
'I am happy about the money.

296
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:12,820
I needed money, and now I'm rich.

297
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,260
Things are going to be easier for me now.

298
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
But Mother...

299
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,520
why didn't I love her more?

300
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:29,380
And now she's dead.'

301
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,929
Slowly, Roger went back upstairs.

302
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:42,639
He wanted to dress before Dr Pratt arrived.

303
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,690
Dr Pratt was a little fat man without much
hair.

304
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:56,630
He was the family doctor and he knew all the
Clarkson family very well.

305
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:02,880
He went upstairs at once and looked at Molly's
body.

306
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,440
He looked carefully at the cup of coffee and
the empty cup on the table next to her bed.

307
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,000
'I'm sorry, Roger,' he said.

308
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,039
'Where is Diane?

309
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,899
She phoned me.'

310
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,790
'She went out with the dogs,' Roger said.

311
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:33,940
'She was angry with me - angry with everyone.'

312
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,180
Dr Pratt said nothing for a minute.

313
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,600
'This is going to be very difficult.

314
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,649
I'm going to phone the police, Roger.'

315
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:49,659
'Police!

316
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:50,669
Why?

317
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,679
What's wrong?'

318
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,710
'I don't know.

319
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,350
Your mother wasn't ill.

320
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:03,860
I saw her on Thursday and she was very well.

321
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,679
Why did she die?

322
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,049
I don't understand.

323
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:15,480
I want to find out.'

324
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,690
Roger went across to the window and looked
out at the garden.

325
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,960
It was a beautiful summer morning.

326
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,200
The sky was blue and the garden was green.

327
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,049
It was all very quiet.

328
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,400
His mother loved this garden.

329
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,580
But Tom Briggs wanted the garden.

330
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,700
And Roger wanted the garden, too.

331
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,110
Roger felt worse and worse.

332
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:56,600
'Your mother took sleeping tablets,' Dr Pratt
said.

333
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,010
'Did you know?

334
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:09,809
On Thursday she had a new bottle of tablets,
but I can't find it here in her room.'

335
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,419
'I didn't know,' Roger said.

336
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,679
'Very well.

337
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,250
Let's go downstairs and you can phone the
police.'

338
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,059
Roger went into the kitchen and made some
coffee.

339
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:33,000
Just then Diane came in with the dogs.

340
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,400
'Roger,' she said.

341
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,799
'Look, I'm sorry.

342
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,100
I was angry and said some angry things.'

343
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,140
'It doesn't matter,' Roger said.

344
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,549
'Here you are, have some coffee.

345
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:56,269
Dr Pratt is phoning the police.

346
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:02,019
Did you know Mother took sleeping tablets?

347
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:08,490
Well, the bottle is not in her room.'

348
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,720
'What?

349
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,309
I don't understand.'

350
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:16,649
Diane took the coffee and began to drink.

351
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,779
Her eyes looked big and dark.

352
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,919
Just then Dr Pratt came into the kitchen.

353
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,519
'They're coming at once,' he said.

354
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,529
'Diane - I'm sorry about your mother.'

355
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:42,830
'Dr Pratt, I want to tell you about last night.

356
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,809
Everyone was very angry . . .' 'Be quiet!'

357
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,120
Roger said quickly.

358
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:59,140
'Diane never thinks before she opens her mouth,'
he thought angrily.

359
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,750
Diane did not look at Roger.

360
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,350
'Last night Mother went to bed early because
everyone . . .'

361
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,289
'Don't tell me,' Dr Pratt said.

362
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,700
'You can tell the police.'

363
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,370
Roger's face went red.

364
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,390
Suddenly he felt afraid.

365
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:29,140
'The police are going to talk to everyone,
and ask questions,' he thought.

366
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:34,909
'And they're going to want answers.

367
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,600
It's going to be very difficult.'

368
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,090
He finished his coffee and stood up.

369
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,659
'I'm going upstairs,' he said.

370
00:27:46,659 --> 00:28:12,850
'I'm going to tell Uncle Albert and Jackie
about Mother... and about the police.'

371
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,850
CHAPTER FOUR

372
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,850
The police arrived very quickly.

373
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,360
There were a lot of them.

374
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,870
Some of them with cameras went upstairs to
Molly's room.

375
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,779
Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the kitchen.

376
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:34,659
The family waited in the sitting room.

377
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:40,309
It was a hot day again and the windows were
open.

378
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:46,950
The dogs sat quietly at Diane's feet.

379
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,960
Nobody talked.

380
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,620
Jackie smoked.

381
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,100
They waited for a long time.

382
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:03,080
Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives
came in.

383
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,090
'Good morning.

384
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:14,860
I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is
Sergeant Foster.'

385
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,919
The Inspector did not smile.

386
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:27,600
He was a big man in an old black suit and
a black hat and coat.

387
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,610
He wore a coat because he always felt cold.

388
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:42,460
'Last night someone put sleeping tablets in
Mrs Clarkson's hot milk.

389
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:50,520
We are going to question everybody, and we
need a room, please.'

390
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,419
Roger stood up.

391
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:56,490
'I'm Roger Clarkson.

392
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,440
You can have my father's old office.

393
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,909
Come with me, it's along here.'

394
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:16,419
The office was not a very big room, but there
was a table and three or four chairs.

395
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,549
Roger opened the window.

396
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:27,799
'I would like to talk first to your uncle,
Albert King,' Inspector Walsh said.

397
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:34,450
He took off his hat and coat and sat down
behind the table.

398
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:41,970
'Of course,' said Roger and left the room.

399
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,580
Sergeant Foster waited by the door.

400
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:53,669
He was a very tall young man with black hair
and a nice smile.

401
00:30:53,669 --> 00:31:01,630
He was not very happy this morning because
he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings.

402
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:07,130
He was one of the best players at the Cambridge
Tennis Club.

403
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,730
Albert came in and sat down.

404
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:20,840
'I'm going to ask some questions, Mr King,'
the Inspector said, 'and Sergeant Foster is

405
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,409
going to write it all down.'

406
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,860
Albert looked at his feet.

407
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,880
'Yes, yes.

408
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,299
It's your job.

409
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,629
I know that.'

410
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:42,009
'Tell me about last night,' Inspector Walsh
asked quietly.

411
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:47,539
'You were angry with Mrs Clarkson.'

412
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:52,100
Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the first
time.

413
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,300
'Yes, I was.

414
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,249
Everyone was angry.

415
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:01,720
Roger was angry.

416
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,130
Diane wanted money to go to America.

417
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,659
Then there's a man called Tom Briggs...

418
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:18,940
He wants half the garden for his farm.

419
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,019
Molly was a rich woman.

420
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:32,889
I need money because my wife Annie - Molly's
sister - is very ill.

421
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,549
I told Molly this.'

422
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,509
'What happened next?'

423
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:47,159
'Well, Molly was angry with everyone and went
upstairs.

424
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,529
We went into the kitchen for coffee.

425
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:59,129
Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good
night to Molly.

426
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:06,919
She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly
to be happy.

427
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:10,080
At first Roger said no.

428
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,879
He was angry and didn't want to see his mother.'

429
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:20,000
'And did you see Molly in her room?'

430
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
'Yes.

431
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,669
I was tired and I went upstairs first.

432
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:34,929
I went to Molly's room and asked her for money
again.

433
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:43,510
But no - there was no money for her sister.'

434
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,760
Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes.

435
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,490
Inspector Walsh watched Albert for a minute.

436
00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:00,110
'Did you hear noises after you went to bed?'

437
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:07,490
'Everyone went into Molly's room to say good
night, I think.

438
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,190
Later, I heard someone...

439
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,190
He - or she - went downstairs.

440
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,849
That was about midnight.'

441
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,510
'Very well, Mr King.

442
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,720
Thank you, you can go now.'

443
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,619
Albert left the room.

444
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,540
Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head.

445
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,880
'What time is it?

446
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,550
I'm hungry.

447
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:45,330
We're learning a lot, but I need some coffee.'

448
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,919
'Shall I go to the kitchen?'

449
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,970
Sergeant Foster asked.

450
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,690
'Oh, no.

451
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,060
Later.

452
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,579
Let's see Jackie Clarkson next.'

453
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,349
Jackie came in and sat down.

454
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,310
She looked down at her hands and said nothing.

455
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:20,180
'We found the empty bottle of your mother's
sleeping tablets in Diane's room,' the Inspector

456
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,040
said suddenly.

457
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,309
Then he waited.

458
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:31,270
Jackie's face did not change and she said
nothing.

459
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:40,470
'Tell me, did your mother get her tablets
from the shop in the village?'

460
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,020
'Yes.

461
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:52,420
My mother usually took a sleeping tablet every
night so she needed a lot of tablets.

462
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:59,860
Sometimes she got them from the shop, sometimes
I did.

463
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,470
On Thursday, I asked Peter Hobbs to get them.

464
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:13,890
He lives in the house across the road, and
he often goes to the village on his bicycle.'

465
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,130
'I see.

466
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,829
Your mother wanted to stay in this house.

467
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,859
How about you?

468
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,410
Did you want to move?'

469
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:36,859
Jackie looked up for a minute and then down
at her hands again.

470
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:41,220
'This is Mother's house.

471
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,030
I loved my mother.

472
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,359
She was good to me.'

473
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:54,050
'Did you see your mother in her room last
night?'

474
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,540
'Yes, everyone did.

475
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,920
Diane made hot milk and took it to Mother.

476
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,790
She usually drank a cup of hot milk before
she slept.'

477
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,470
Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head.

478
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,470
Jackie was very quiet.

479
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,970
'What did your mother say?'

480
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,790
Jackie opened her bag and looked for a cigarette.

481
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,880
'Can I smoke?'

482
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,940
'Of course.

483
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,500
This is your house,' Inspector Walsh said.

484
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,750
He watched Jackie.

485
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:45,819
'What did your mother say?' he asked again.

486
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:51,369
'She wanted to go downstairs again.

487
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:57,550
She remembered the dogs - she wanted to get
some dinner for them.

488
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:03,810
I went to my room and she went downstairs.'

489
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,910
'What time was this?'

490
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,120
'I don't remember.

491
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,250
About midnight, I think.'

492
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,540
'And the cup of hot milk?'

493
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,800
'It was on the table by her bed.'

494
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,330
'Did you need your mother's money?'

495
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,330
'No, Inspector.

496
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:34,400
Money is not important to me.

497
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,590
There are more important things,' Jackie said
quietly.

498
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:48,000
'Well, your uncle Albert wanted money.

499
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,270
Tom Briggs wanted the garden.

500
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,640
You wanted nothing?'

501
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,400
Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up
at the Inspector.

502
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,820
Her eyes were suddenly angry.

503
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:09,290
'Don't forget Peter Hobbs.

504
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:13,310
He lost his job because of my mother.

505
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,069
He wanted to kill her, you know.

506
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:20,440
And what about Diane?

507
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,109
You found the empty bottle in her bag.'

508
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:28,890
Inspector Walsh listened carefully.

509
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:35,680
'We're going to question everyone, Miss Clarkson.'

510
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,500
Jackie said nothing for a minute.

511
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,490
'Would you like some sandwiches and coffee,
Inspector?'

512
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,660
'Ah!

513
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,000
Yes, please!'

514
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,109
Inspector Walsh said warmly.

515
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:54,470
'I would like sandwiches and coffee very much.'

516
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,660
Jackie left the room.

517
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,630
Inspector Walsh thought about her.

518
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:08,490
Why was she suddenly angry?

519
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:22,540
The room was quiet.

520
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,660
CHAPTER FIVE

521
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:36,559
After the coffee and sandwiches, Inspector
Walsh called Roger Clarkson to the office.

522
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,300
Roger came in and sat down.

523
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,619
The Inspector began at once.

524
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,490
'Now, Mr Clarkson.

525
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,960
Why was your mother angry with you last night?'

526
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,119
'This house is very big,' Roger said.

527
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,530
'It was a lot of work for Mother.

528
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,230
I wanted her to move.

529
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:10,130
But no, she loved this house and garden.

530
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,700
She didn't want to move.'

531
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:20,119
'Tell me about your job, Mr Clarkson.

532
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,580
Your mother is dead and now you're rich.

533
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,809
Do you need money?'

534
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:33,990
Roger's face was suddenly afraid.

535
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,839
'What are you saying?

536
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,490
I didn't kill my mother.

537
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,559
I need money, that's true.

538
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:51,460
A friend and I want to build ten houses here,
in this garden.

539
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,059
We can get a lot of money for them.

540
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:01,180
So I wanted Mother to sell this house.

541
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,030
It's true.

542
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:10,849
But Mr Briggs wanted half the garden, too,
you know, for his farm.'

543
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:14,589
Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table.

544
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:21,040
'Tell me, what happened upstairs?

545
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,790
You went to your mother's room?'

546
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,089
'Yes, I did.

547
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:33,560
I wanted to say goodnight to my mother.'

548
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,170
'Did you talk about the house again?'

549
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,410
'Yes, I did.

550
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,790
Again, she said no.

551
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:49,150
She loved the house and didn't want to sell
it.'

552
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,089
Inspector Walsh watched Roger for a minute.

553
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,549
'I see.

554
00:42:54,549 --> 00:43:05,250
We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets,
Mr Clarkson, in Diane's room.'

555
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,660
Roger's face did not change.

556
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,170
'Oh?

557
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,380
Someone put them there.

558
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,990
Diane did not kill my mother, I know that.

559
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,350
She found the body.'

560
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,540
'Very well.

561
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,290
I would like to see Diane next.'

562
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:35,690
Roger got up and left the room.

563
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:41,490
Inspector Walsh stood up and put his hands
in his pockets.

564
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:47,099
He went to the window and looked out at the
trees.

565
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,339
Why was Roger Clarkson afraid?

566
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:54,530
Was it important?

567
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,000
He looked at Sergeant Foster.

568
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:06,660
'Tomorrow morning, go to Mr Clarkson's office
- you have the name,' he said.

569
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:15,799
'Ask some questions about him, about his job,
friends, money.'

570
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,270
Sergeant Foster wrote it down.

571
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,930
'Yes, Inspector.'

572
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,770
'A good day for tennis, Sergeant?'

573
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,570
Sergeant Foster laughed.

574
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,869
'Don't say that.

575
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,589
It's not easy, you know.

576
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:40,270
I don't like sitting here looking at the sun.'

577
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:44,770
Diane came into the room and sat down.

578
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,819
She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled.

579
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:54,520
'I saw you at the Tennis Club last month,
I think.

580
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,150
You play very well.'

581
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,990
Sergeant Foster's face went red.

582
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,170
Inspector Walsh looked at him.

583
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,960
'Oh yes.

584
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,310
A fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster.'

585
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:18,510
Diane smiled again at Sergeant Foster and
his face went redder.

586
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:28,559
'Well, Miss Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh said,
'I want you to talk about last night.'

587
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,490
Diane stopped smiling.

588
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:37,160
'Oh, I can talk about last night.

589
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,270
I can't stop talking about it.

590
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,630
We were all angry.

591
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:51,880
Mother went to bed early and I made hot milk
for her.

592
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,060
We were all in the kitchen, and Peter Hobbs
came in.

593
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,380
He nearly broke the back door down.'

594
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,339
Diane stopped.

595
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:05,819
'Yes?'

596
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:11,240
'He was very angry about a letter.

597
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,730
He wanted to kill Mother.

598
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,119
Are you going to talk to him?'

599
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,920
'We're going to talk to everyone.'

600
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,599
'Good.

601
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:28,190
Tom Briggs came into the kitchen, too.

602
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,220
Are you going to talk to him?'

603
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,560
'I'm asking the questions, Miss Clarkson.

604
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,890
When did you take the milk upstairs?'

605
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,859
'I went up after Roger.'

606
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,740
She stopped for a minute.

607
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,350
Then she began again.

608
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:55,049
'I didn't like my mother, Inspector.

609
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:59,130
She killed my father, you know.

610
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:11,390
Last winter, after Christmas, she drove the
car into a tree and killed my father.'

611
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,490
Inspector Walsh watched Diane's face carefully.

612
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,950
'I see.

613
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:23,430
So you wanted to kill your mother?'

614
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,130
Diane laughed.

615
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:30,390
'I wanted to kill her, but I didn't.

616
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:38,059
I can tell you a lot of things about this
family, Inspector.

617
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:42,039
Everyone wanted Mother to die.

618
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:46,610
Uncle Albert wanted her money for his wife,
Annie.

619
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:50,119
And then my brother.

620
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:51,789
He needs a lot of money.

621
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:58,920
He has an expensive house and an expensive
car.

622
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,640
And think of Jackie.

623
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:07,500
Do you know that Jackie didn't like Mother?

624
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,829
A long time ago, a nice boy worked here.

625
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,789
He was the gardener.

626
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:20,950
Jackie loved him very much, but Mother said
no.

627
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:29,420
A gardener was not a good husband for a Clarkson
girl!'

628
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,450
Inspector Walsh listened quietly.

629
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,349
All this was very interesting but was it important?

630
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:39,420
Perhaps.

631
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:46,900
What a happy family the Clarksons were!

632
00:48:46,900 --> 00:49:00,650
'We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets
in your room,' Inspector Walsh said quietly.

633
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,289
He watched her face carefully.

634
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:10,829
Diane stood up suddenly, her face angry.

635
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:11,990
'What?

636
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,559
I didn't put it there!

637
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,930
I'm not going to listen to this!'

638
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,410
She ran out of the room.

639
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:28,920
'Well, well, well,' Inspector Walsh said.

640
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
'She likes you, Sergeant.

641
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,710
You need to be careful.'

642
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:42,820
Sergeant Foster laughed but his face went
red again.

643
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:51,510
'Someone put sleeping tablets in Molly's hot
milk,' the Inspector said.

644
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,990
'All the family were in the kitchen last night.

645
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:02,840
Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs were there, too.

646
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:10,619
One of them killed Molly.'

647
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,380
Inspector Walsh got his hat and coat.

648
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,390
'Come on.

649
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:21,630
We need to talk to Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs.

650
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,829
Let's get some more coffee first.

651
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:29,539
I'd like a sandwich, too.

652
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:41,670
I'm hungry again!'

653
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,670
CHAPTER SIX

654
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:53,770
They found Peter Hobbs under his car - an
old green car.

655
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:56,750
He got up slowly.

656
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:02,569
He wore old blue trousers and a dirty orange
shirt.

657
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:09,579
'We want to talk about Mrs Clarkson,' Inspector
Walsh said.

658
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:16,539
'Oh, it's about her,' Peter said.

659
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:19,240
He looked at the Inspector.

660
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,020
'I know she's dead.

661
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,880
Someone in the village told me.'

662
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,089
'Why did you go to the Clarksons' house last
night?'

663
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:37,069
'Jackie wanted me to come and see her brother,
Roger.

664
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:39,640
"You're angry," she said.

665
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,690
"Come and tell Roger."

666
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:47,790
I went to the house but nobody opened the
door.

667
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:56,339
So I made a lot of noise and then they opened
the door.

668
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,760
Old Mrs Clarkson wasn't there.

669
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,560
But I told Roger.

670
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,970
I told them all!'

671
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,420
Peter hit the car with his hand.

672
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,890
'I wanted to kill that woman.

673
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:21,089
I lost my job, my first job, because of her.

674
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:31,150
Last month I was in trouble with the police
and that old woman wrote to my office and

675
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,780
she told them about the police.

676
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,869
I wanted to kill her!'

677
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:41,380
'Take it easy!'

678
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,820
Inspector Walsh said.

679
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,190
'What happened next?'

680
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:55,670
'Jackie gave me some coffee, but her brother
didn't listen to me,' Peter said angrily.

681
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,610
'Then Tom Briggs came in.

682
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,970
He wanted to talk to Roger, too.

683
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,210
But Roger didn't listen to him.

684
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:15,270
Jackie was very unhappy - she nearly cried.

685
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,619
Then I went home.

686
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:20,400
That's all.'

687
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,180
'I see.

688
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:28,039
Now tell me about the tablets.

689
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:31,200
You went to the village on Thursday?'

690
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,680
'Tablets?

691
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,650
Oh, yes.

692
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,619
I remember.

693
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:42,770
Jackie wanted me to get her mother's tablets
from the village.

694
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:49,960
I go to the village on my bicycle - this car
doesn't work.'

695
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,010
'Thank you, Peter.

696
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,010
That's all.'

697
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,990
'That's all?'

698
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,569
Peter laughed angrily.

699
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:05,319
'You're going to come back, I know that!

700
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:08,870
I know the police!'

701
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:17,190
Tom Briggs' farm was about half a mile away,
near the river.

702
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:23,849
It was not a big farm, and the house was old
and dirty.

703
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:29,220
'Not much money here,' Inspector Walsh said.

704
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:38,119
Tom Briggs was a young man, about thirty years
old, with dirty hands and bad teeth.

705
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,020
'What's wrong?

706
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:46,320
Excuse me, I'm eating my dinner,' he said.

707
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,970
'We can wait.

708
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,830
Finish your dinner,' Inspector Walsh said.

709
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:59,210
'We want to ask one or two questions about
last night.'

710
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:07,210
'Come and wait in the front room,' Tom said
and opened the door.

711
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:13,920
Inspector Walsh looked at the things in the
front room.

712
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,960
There was an old black and white television,
and some books on the table.

713
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:29,720
There was a picture of a happy young girl
with long brown hair on the table, too.

714
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,539
Inspector Walsh looked at the picture for
a long time.

715
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:38,329
Who was the girl?

716
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:44,140
Tom Briggs came back into the front room.

717
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,250
'Finished?'

718
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,450
Inspector Walsh asked.

719
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:53,400
'You know Mrs Clarkson is dead?'

720
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,589
Tom Briggs sat down suddenly on the nearest
chair.

721
00:55:58,589 --> 00:55:59,589
'What?

722
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:03,190
How did she die?

723
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,880
When did it happen?

724
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,380
I was there last night.'

725
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:16,500
'She died last night or early this morning.

726
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,900
What did you do last night?'

727
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,900
'Me?

728
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,540
Why are you asking me?

729
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:28,720
I went there to meet Mr Clarkson - Roger.

730
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:36,200
I'm losing money on this farm and I need more
land.

731
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,010
I want half Mrs Clarkson's garden.'

732
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,329
'You went into the kitchen.

733
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:46,319
What did you do next?

734
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,039
Can you remember?'

735
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:57,560
Tom Briggs looked at Sergeant Foster and then
back at Inspector Walsh.

736
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,400
'I remember it very well.

737
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,660
All the family were in the kitchen.

738
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,710
Peter Hobbs was there, too.

739
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,270
I talked to Roger.

740
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,050
He wants his mother to sell the house.

741
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:20,680
But he wants the land.

742
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,539
He doesn't want me to have it.

743
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:28,900
But now Mrs Clarkson is dead.

744
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,520
What's going to happen now?'

745
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,250
Inspector Walsh got up and took the picture
of the girl from the table.

746
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,950
'Who's this?'

747
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,970
Tom's face went red.

748
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,190
'Who?

749
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,410
Oh!

750
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:52,069
That's a friend.

751
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:56,890
It's not ... It was a long time ago.'

752
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:05,740
The two detectives walked back to the Clarksons'
house through the garden.

753
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:10,850
It was beautiful, green and quiet.

754
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,829
Inspector Walsh felt tired and hungry.

755
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:18,720
Who killed Molly?

756
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:25,599
He knew the answer now, but he needed to ask
one or two more questions.

757
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:34,150
'Let's go, Sergeant,' he said, and put on
his hat again.

758
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:46,720
'Tomorrow is a new day.'

759
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,760
CHAPTER SEVEN

760
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:58,410
On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to
Roger's office and asked some questions.

761
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:08,450
And then he went to Albert's house and asked
some more questions.

762
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:14,130
Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned.

763
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:23,859
He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and
he made phone calls about Tom Briggs.

764
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:28,980
And then he had some coffee and sandwiches.

765
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:36,529
At three o'clock the two detectives drove
to the Clarksons' house.

766
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:42,960
'I would like to see everyone,' he told Roger.

767
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,220
Everyone came into the sitting room and sat
down.

768
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:57,110
Inspector Walsh stood in front of the windows
and looked at them, one by one.

769
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:02,369
'I want to talk to you.

770
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:06,670
Someone killed Molly Clarkson.

771
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:13,710
Someone put sleeping tablets in her hot milk
and killed her.

772
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:25,440
Nobody wanted to tell me the true story, but
now I know the true story and I'm going to

773
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,900
tell you.'

774
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:36,029
The two dogs came slowly into the room and
sat down at Diane's feet.

775
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:38,500
It was very quiet in the room.

776
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,260
The Inspector looked at Albert.

777
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:52,700
'Mr King, your wife is very ill and needs
a nurse.

778
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,809
You told me this.

779
01:00:55,809 --> 01:01:00,270
You didn't tell me about your house.

780
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:09,510
You're selling your house next month because
you need the money.'

781
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,200
Albert was angry.

782
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:21,560
'Last year I asked Molly's husband for some
money, and he said yes.

783
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:26,069
But then he died in an accident.'

784
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:27,819
'Accident!'

785
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:31,329
Diane cried.

786
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:36,750
'That was no accident.

787
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:42,770
Mother killed Daddy because she wanted his
money!'

788
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:50,069
'Let's talk about you now, Diane,' said Inspector
Walsh.

789
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:59,250
'You visited your mother every month and you
took money from her.

790
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:04,059
Last month she gave you money for your television.

791
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:12,550
This month she gave you money for your telephone.

792
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:21,710
Every month you told your mother: "It was
no accident; you killed Daddy.

793
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:26,240
I'm going to tell the police."

794
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:36,710
Your mother was afraid of the police and so
she gave you the money.

795
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:42,740
But in the end she wanted to stop you.

796
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,930
She told Dr Pratt.

797
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:57,280
No more money, she told Dr Pratt on Thursday;
and on Saturday she died.

798
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:08,200
You took the hot milk to your mother - what
did she tell you?'

799
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,520
Diane began to cry.

800
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,140
'I loved Daddy!

801
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:22,869
He always gave money to me; he loved me.

802
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:32,920
It was Mother - she didn't love Daddy and
she didn't love me.'

803
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,520
Diane stopped.

804
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,010
The dogs got up and went to the door.

805
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:46,920
'It's true, I took a lot of money from Mother.

806
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,539
On Saturday she told me - no more money.

807
01:03:52,539 --> 01:04:00,349
I wanted to kill her, but I didn't.'

808
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:07,789
The dogs came back and sat down again at Diane's
feet.

809
01:04:07,789 --> 01:04:10,710
Inspector Walsh looked at Roger.

810
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:16,710
'Mr Clarkson also needed money.'

811
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,859
Roger's face went red.

812
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:22,569
'Don't tell them!

813
01:04:22,569 --> 01:04:23,799
Please!'

814
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:29,980
'Mr Clarkson lost his job last month.

815
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,829
He has no money.

816
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:40,180
But he has an expensive house and an expensive
car.

817
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:46,450
He likes expensive things.'

818
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:52,849
His sisters looked at him, but Roger put his
hand over his eyes.

819
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:57,299
'Don't talk to me!'

820
01:04:57,299 --> 01:05:00,460
'It doesn't matter now!'

821
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,849
Diane said.

822
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:07,970
'Mother is dead and we have a lot of money.

823
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,079
You don't need a job.'

824
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,640
Roger's face went red again.

825
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,460
'Be quiet, Diane!'

826
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,040
'Now,' Inspector Walsh began again.

827
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:29,539
'Peter Hobbs is a very angry young man.

828
01:05:29,539 --> 01:05:35,490
Mrs Clarkson was not very nice to him.

829
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,940
He got the sleeping tablets from the shop.

830
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:45,769
But did he put the tablets in the hot milk?

831
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:49,329
I think not.

832
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:56,730
Tom Briggs wanted half the garden for his
farm.

833
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:00,400
He was in the kitchen that night.

834
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:07,619
Did he put sleeping tablets in the hot milk?

835
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:12,069
I think not.'

836
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:15,069
Suddenly it began to rain.

837
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:20,589
For a minute everyone watched it through the
window.

838
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:27,200
Jackie took a cigarette from her bag and began
to smoke.

839
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:34,500
'But someone wanted Peter Hobbs to come into
the kitchen that night.

840
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:44,619
She wanted everyone to see him, and listen
to him,' Inspector Walsh said.

841
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:46,750
'She...?

842
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:55,059
I don't understand,' Roger began, and stopped.

843
01:06:55,059 --> 01:07:00,710
Inspector Walsh moved away from the window
and sat down.

844
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:06,480
'I'm going to tell you the true story now.

845
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:16,869
Miss Clarkson, you wanted Peter Hobbs to come
to the house that night.

846
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:21,780
He was very angry with your mother because
of that letter.

847
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:27,400
He said: "I want to kill her."

848
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,799
And you wanted everyone to hear that.

849
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:36,039
Why?'

850
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,240
Jackie's face went white.

851
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,140
'It's not true!

852
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,510
What about Diane?

853
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:50,720
You found the empty bottle in her bag!'

854
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,070
Diane stood up.

855
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,630
'In my bag?

856
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,630
Jackie!

857
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:59,630
What are you talking about?'

858
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:10,119
'Be quiet, please, and sit down,' Inspector
Walsh said.

859
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,210
He looked at Jackie.

860
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:18,630
'It's true: we found the bottle in Diane's
bag.

861
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,859
But how do you know that?

862
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:25,180
We didn't tell you.'

863
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,549
'You did... before...

864
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:33,759
you told me before!'

865
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,420
'No.

866
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:42,900
We found the empty bottle in Diane's room.

867
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,750
We told you that.

868
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:54,210
You talked about Diane's bag; we didn't tell
you.

869
01:08:54,210 --> 01:09:00,460
Sergeant Foster wrote it all down.'

870
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,569
Inspector Walsh looked carefully at Jackie.

871
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:11,299
'A long time ago, you knew Tom Briggs.

872
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:18,759
He was the gardener here and you loved him.

873
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:24,319
But your mother didn't like him.'

874
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,750
Jackie put her hands to her head.

875
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,220
'No!

876
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,690
No!'

877
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:40,250
'We found your picture - an old one - in Mr
Briggs' house.

878
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:47,009
You were younger then, and your hair was long.

879
01:09:47,009 --> 01:09:54,150
Last year Tom Briggs came back, and you wanted
him.

880
01:09:54,150 --> 01:10:02,360
He loved you, too, but he had no money.

881
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:12,800
He wanted the garden for his farm, he wanted
money, he wanted you.

882
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,570
But your mother said no.

883
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:28,520
In the end, you wanted to kill your mother...
and you did kill her.

884
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:39,489
Your mother went downstairs to see the dogs
and you put the sleeping tablets in her hot

885
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,560
milk.

886
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:51,179
Later, you put the empty bottle in Diane's
bag.'

887
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:53,900
Jackie stood up.

888
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,670
Her eyes were dark and afraid.

889
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,070
'You don't understand!'

890
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,280
she cried.

891
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:08,219
'Mother gave me nothing ... all those years.

892
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:14,949
I wanted to be happy ... to be with Tom.

893
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:16,840
That's all.

894
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:22,440
I love Tom, and he loves me.

895
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,880
But Mother said no.

896
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,290
Always no.'

897
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:35,330
Then she began to cry.

898
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,930
Nobody looked at her.

899
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:44,780
Jackie left the house in a police car.

900
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:51,410
Inspector Walsh watched and then walked slowly
to his car.

901
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:57,220
He felt tired and hungry.

902
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:02,060
He stopped and looked back at the house.

903
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:17,510
'Well,' he said to Sergeant Foster, 'in the
end, they got the money: Albert, Roger, Diane.

904
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:24,159
They're all rich now.

905
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:29,440
But are they going to be happy?'

906
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,699
He got into the car.

907
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:36,150
'Let's go,' he said.

908
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,650
'I'm hungry; I need a sandwich.'

909
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:40,669
- THE END -
