1
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,320
CHAPTER ONE
The body - 1999

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,790
A group of five climbers move slowly across
the north face of Everest.

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:34,340
Suddenly, one of them sees something strange
on the rocks below him.

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,010
Something whiter than the snow.

5
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,600
Carefully, he climbs down towards it.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,690
Then he calls his friends on his radio.

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,380
'Come down here,' he says.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,550
'Look at this.'

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,280
Coming closer, they see it is the dead body
of a climber.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,500
The wind has blown some of the clothes from
the body, and the skin is clean and white,

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
like new stone.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,480
In the icy cold, it looks like the body of
a man who died a few days ago.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,220
But the bits of clothes that are still on
the body are old, brown and grey - nothing

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,110
like the brightly coloured clothes that modern
climbers wear.

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,000
The body is lying face down.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,600
Above the head, the fingers of one hand are
dug into the icy ground.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,360
One leg is broken in two places below the
knee, and the other leg is lying over it.

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,890
The body looks strong and healthy, they think,
like the body of a runner or dancer.

19
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,970
The climbers photograph the body carefully.

20
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:56,060
Then, very gently, they touch the dead man's
clothes - the hobnail boots, the trousers

21
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,989
and shirt made of wool.

22
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,440
How little he was wearing, they think, on
this icy cold mountain.

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,200
'I walk out on the street in Seattle with
more clothing than he had on,' one of them

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
says.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:20,580
Yet here they are at 8,155 metres on Mount
Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

26
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,740
Who is this man?

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,860
He can only be one of two people, they think.

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,540
But which one?

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,300
Then they find a name inside his shirt.

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,860
'George Leigh Mallory', it says.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,360
But who is George Leigh Mallory?

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,340
Why are these climbers so interested in him?

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,530
How did he die, and what happened to him before
he died?

34
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,960
Where is his friend, Andrew Irvine?

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:58,250
And the most important question of all - was
this man, George Mallory, the first man to

36
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:12,270
reach the summit of Everest?

37
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,550
CHAPTER TWO
Dangers

38
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,830
The climbers do not stay long with the body,
because Mount Everest is one of the most dangerous

39
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,430
places in the world.

40
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,690
There are many things that make it difficult
to stay alive here.

41
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,680
The most important of these is the height.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,430
The top of Everest is 8,850 metres above sea
level.

43
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:48,240
As you climb up the mountain, the air becomes
thinner - it has less and less oxygen.

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,209
Most people live less than 900 metres above
sea level, where the air is full of oxygen.

45
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:02,330
Above 2,000 metres the air is thinner, and
people find it harder to breathe.

46
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:11,099
At 4,000 metres it is harder still, and at
5,000 metres most people begin to feel ill.

47
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:18,040
They get headaches, feel tired, and breathe
quickly all the time, like someone who has

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,109
run a long way.

49
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:27,660
In 1921, when Mallory first went to Everest,
no one had climbed a mountain higher than

50
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,630
7,500 metres, and many people did not think
it was possible.

51
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:39,970
'If climbers don't have enough oxygen, they'll
be too tired to climb,' they said.

52
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,450
And they won't be able to think clearly, either.

53
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,070
So they will make stupid mistakes - forget
to eat and drink, or talk to people who are

54
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,060
not there.

55
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
Perhaps they'll die.'

56
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,919
But the need for oxygen is not the only problem
on Everest.

57
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,780
There is also the weather.

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,400
Almost every week there are winds of 100 or
even 200 kph (kilometres per hour).

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,180
It is difficult to walk or even stand up in
these winds.

60
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,510
The wind can blow climbers off the edge of
the mountain, thousands of metres to the valley

61
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,600
below.

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,970
Climbers sometimes sit in their tents for
days, unable to sleep because of the noise,

63
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,650
and afraid that the wind will blow their tents
away.

64
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,940
And then there is the cold.

65
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:43,050
Temperatures on Everest often fall below -20
degrees, but the wind makes that feel much

66
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,360
colder.

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,430
But before anyone can climb Everest they have
to get there.

68
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:59,230
Tibet in China is to the north of Everest,
and Nepal is to the south, and until 1950,

69
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,590
Nepal refused to let any foreign climbers
enter their country.

70
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,610
So the earliest climbers, like Mallory and
Irvine, had to get to Everest from the north,

71
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,610
through Tibet.

72
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:27,130
And that was not easy at all.

73
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:35,790
CHAPTER THREE
Through Tibet to Everest - 1921

74
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,840
Until the early nineteenth century, nobody
in the west knew about Mount Everest.

75
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,060
People in Tibet knew, of course - they called
it Chomolungma: 'Goddess Mother of the World',

76
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,940
and to people in Nepal it was Sagarmatha:
'Goddess of the Sky'.

77
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,740
But no one in Tibet or Nepal had ever climbed
the mountain - they thought that was a very

78
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,020
strange idea.

79
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:09,620
And no foreign person had ever been so far
into the Himalayas.

80
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,669
But in the 1830s a British soldier called
George Everest was making maps in north India.

81
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:24,020
He made the first maps of the Himalayas, and
measured the height of some of the mountains.

82
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,990
But Everest finished his work in 1843, and
he never saw Chomolungma.

83
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,980
The first British man to see the mountain
was Everest's friend, Andrew Waugh.

84
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:44,380
In 1852 Radhanath Sikdhar, who worked for
Waugh, said he had discovered the highest

85
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,810
mountain in the world.

86
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,150
It was measured carefully many times.

87
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,169
Then in 1856 Waugh said that this was the
highest mountain in the world.

88
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,320
He gave it the name of his old friend, George
Everest, in 1865.

89
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,139
But very few British people were able to enter
Tibet or Nepal at that time.

90
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,580
So it was not until 1921 that the first British
expedition went to see if it was possible

91
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,150
to climb the mountain.

92
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:26,020
There were nine British climbers on this expedition,
and one of them was George Mallory.

93
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,050
To get to Everest, the climbers had to walk
500 kilometres through Tibet.

94
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:39,020
Their Tibetan porters carried everything they
needed: food, tents, clothes, cameras, and

95
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
climbing equipment.

96
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,510
It was a long, difficult journey which took
a month.

97
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:52,019
They were always climbing - at first through
river valleys with tall trees, colourful flowers

98
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:58,209
and birds - then onto a wide stony place where
nothing grew.

99
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:05,910
There was no sound except the wind, and all
the time the air was becoming thinner.

100
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,990
The climbers walked past Tibetan villages
high up on the sides of mountains, and came

101
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:21,360
to Rongbuk, the highest monastery in the world,
4,800 metres above sea level.

102
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,879
The monks in the monastery looked at the visitors
in surprise, wondering why they wanted to

103
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,910
climb the dangerous mountain.

104
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:37,369
The climbers decided that the best way to
get onto the mountain was to go up the East

105
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,820
Rongbuk Glacier.

106
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,300
From there they planned to climb to the North
Col, a small flat place on the north ridge

107
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,089
of Everest.

108
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:54,290
By this time it was late in the year, and
the winds were getting stronger.

109
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:01,940
They had not planned to get to the summit
this year, but only to look for a way up.

110
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:10,129
But on 23 September 1921, Mallory, with two
other climbers and three porters, climbed

111
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,740
up the steep ice wall of the East Rongbuk
Glacier.

112
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:22,639
When they reached the snow ridge of the North
Col the next day, they could see the summit,

113
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,800
1,800 metres above them.

114
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,550
But at 7,000 metres it was difficult to breathe,
and they moved slowly.

115
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,319
And they could hardly stand up in the strong
icy winds.

116
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:53,989
They would have to go down, and come back
next year.

117
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:58,589
CHAPTER FOUR
The first attempt - 1922

118
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:05,489
In 1922 a larger expedition returned.

119
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:12,059
They brought oxygen with them this time, but
the equipment was very heavy, and it did not

120
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,970
always work.

121
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:21,050
Many of the climbers wanted to climb the mountain
on their own, if possible, without help.

122
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,260
So climbing with oxygen was not popular with
most of the climbers.

123
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:34,870
Four climbers set out on the first summit
attempt - Mallory, Morshead, Norton, and Somervell.

124
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,810
With five porters, they left Camp 4 on the
North Col at 7.00 a.m.

125
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:47,629
There was a terrible cold wind, and the climbers
moved slowly, cutting steps in the snow for

126
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,250
the porters behind them.

127
00:11:50,250 --> 00:12:00,069
They hoped to reach 8,230 metres that day,
but at 7,620 metres they were too cold and

128
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:03,209
tired to go on.

129
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:09,329
They found a place for Camp 5 and the porters
left their loads here and went back down.

130
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,699
The four men crawled into their two small
tents to rest.

131
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:22,279
But all night there was a high wind, and it
was difficult to breathe or sleep.

132
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:29,709
To get water to drink, they had to melt snow
over a small cooker, which took a long time.

133
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,839
Next morning, Morshead was ill.

134
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,629
So Mallory, Norton, and Somervell set out
at 8.00 a.m., leaving Morshead alone in the

135
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,179
tent.

136
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:49,269
They moved slowly, stopping after every few
steps to rest and breathe.

137
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,619
As they climbed, their hobnail boots slipped
dangerously on the stones and rocks.

138
00:12:55,619 --> 00:13:03,249
In the thin air they felt tired, more tired
than any of them had ever felt before.

139
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:14,339
At 2.00 p.m. they reached 8,227 metres, but
they were still about 600 metres below the

140
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,089
summit.

141
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,600
So they turned back, and helped Morshead down
to Camp 3.

142
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,290
On the way down, they met three more of their
climbers coming up.

143
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:35,170
They were the Australian George Finch, a Gurkha
called Tejbir Bura, and Geoffrey Bruce - a

144
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,389
young man who had never climbed before.

145
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,699
Unlike the first group, Finch and Bruce liked
using oxygen.

146
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:52,499
They made a new Camp 5 - 150 metres higher
than Mallory's - but then they were caught

147
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:57,680
in a storm and had to stay in their tent for
two nights.

148
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:07,000
On the third day Finch and Bruce went on,
using their oxygen, to 8,323 metres.

149
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,679
But here Bruce became exhausted and had to
be helped down.

150
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:20,549
Because the oxygen had been so successful,
Mallory, Somervell, and a third climber called

151
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:26,899
Colin Crawford decided to make another attempt,
this time with oxygen.

152
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:34,730
But while they were climbing across a snow
slope, there was a sudden avalanche.

153
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,959
Everyone was buried under the snow.

154
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,709
All the climbers and seven porters managed
to climb out, but seven porters were killed.

155
00:14:43,709 --> 00:15:01,699
It was clear that Everest had won - this time.

156
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:07,480
CHAPTER FIVE
Saving the porters - 1924

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,279
The British climbers returned in April 1924.

158
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,319
This time they planned to succeed.

159
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:24,720
Edward Norton was the chief climber in the
group of twelve men, and they had 150 Tibetan

160
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,799
porters, both men and women, to help them.

161
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:36,249
From Base Camp the porters carried equipment
up to Camps 1 and 2 on the Rongbuk and East

162
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,860
Rongbuk Glaciers.

163
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:47,190
One woman carried her two-year-old child on
top of an 18 kilogram load from 5,300 metres

164
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,619
to 6,000 metres.

165
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:55,189
Then she carried her child back down, and
offered to go up again!

166
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:59,959
The next part was harder.

167
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:07,819
On a cold, stormy day, Mallory, Irvine and
two other climbers set out with twenty porters

168
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:14,339
to carry equipment from Base Camp to Camp
3, but the weather was terrible.

169
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,049
A strong wind blew down off the mountain,
straight into their faces.

170
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:26,949
The ice on the glacier was as clear and hard
as glass.

171
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:34,049
There were not enough tents at Camp 2, so
some of the porters slept outside.

172
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:41,970
Next morning they went on to Camp 3, but here
it was even colder than before.

173
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,999
That night the temperature fell to -29 degrees.

174
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:55,919
The strong icy wind blew into the tents all
night, so everyone - inside the tents - was

175
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,989
covered with snow.

176
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:03,160
The storm blew for two more days.

177
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,559
Many of the porters lay in their tents, not
caring about life or death.

178
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,990
At last the storm ended and they all went
down to Base Camp to rest.

179
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:23,180
Three men were seriously ill; another had
bad frostbite on both feet.

180
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,500
The porters were unhappy and afraid.

181
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,160
'The mountain is angry,' they said.

182
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,030
'It will kill us.'

183
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:40,450
So on 15 May all the climbers and porters
went down the valley to the Rongbuk Monastery,

184
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,070
where the chief monk said prayers for them.

185
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:50,190
Next day the wind had gone, and the sky was
clear and blue.

186
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,630
The climbers returned to Camp 3.

187
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,920
Then they started to climb up the steep ice
wall to the North Col, to make Camp 4.

188
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,550
And once again, things went wrong.

189
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,170
The ice was covered with new snow after the
storm.

190
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:15,370
There were many crevasses - deep holes in
the ice - which were difficult to see under

191
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,400
the snow.

192
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,660
This was the place where seven porters had
died in 1922.

193
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:30,360
This time four people set out - Mallory, Norton,
Odell, and Lakpa Tsering.

194
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,230
They climbed carefully, cutting steps in the
snow.

195
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,000
They crossed several deep crevasses.

196
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,260
Then, just below the North Col, they came
to a steep slope about 100 metres high.

197
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,780
It was a dangerous place.

198
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,480
The slope was covered with new soft snow.

199
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:01,310
At the foot of the slope was a wall of ice,
falling hundreds of metres to the valley below.

200
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:08,430
Mallory climbed slowly up the slope, while
Norton and Odell held him from below on a

201
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,470
rope.

202
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:17,610
After half an hour they reached the top, and
found a place for Camp 4.

203
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,700
But all the climbers were tired.

204
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:28,320
On the way down the snow suddenly collapsed
under Mallory's feet and he fell into a crevasse.

205
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,330
Only his ice axe, across the top of the crevasse,
saved him.

206
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,800
No one had seen him fall.

207
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,060
He looked up, at the sky, then down, into
the deep blue hole below him.

208
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,900
One mistake here could mean death.

209
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:57,190
Very slowly and carefully, he pulled his tired
body up the ice wall and out onto the snow.

210
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:03,050
When the climbers got back to Camp 3 they
were all exhausted.

211
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:11,320
Their heads ached, and they coughed all night
in the thin, cold air.

212
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:20,740
Next day, three more climbers - Somervell,
Irvine, and Hazard - and twelve porters climbed

213
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,300
the snow slope to Camp 4.

214
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:30,980
Somervell and Irvine came down, leaving Hazard
behind with the porters.

215
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,420
That night it snowed heavily, and the temperature
fell to -31 degrees.

216
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,780
The exhausted porters shivered in their tents.

217
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,670
All next day Norton, in Camp 3, waited for
them to come down.

218
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:56,020
At last, he saw them coming - black dots on
the snow.

219
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,810
But only eight porters and Hazard arrived
at Camp 3.

220
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:08,370
Four porters had turned back, afraid that
they would fall.

221
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,990
So now four porters were alone at Camp 4.

222
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:19,380
And more and more snow was falling, making
the steep slope more dangerous than ever.

223
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,910
Without help from the climbers, the porters
would die.

224
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,320
All the climbers were tired and ill.

225
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,980
Mallory and Somervell had bad throats and
were coughing badly.

226
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,660
It snowed heavily all night.

227
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:46,970
But next morning Norton, Mallory, and Somervell
climbed slowly up towards Camp 4.

228
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,630
It was difficult, dangerous work.

229
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,080
They reached the snow slope, and called out
to the porters above them in words like these.

230
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,580
'Are you alive?'

231
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,410
the climbers asked.

232
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,040
'Can you walk?'

233
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,800
'Yes sir,' a porter answered.

234
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,690
'But we're afraid.

235
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,870
It's too dangerous.

236
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,300
If we slip, we'll fall, and die!'

237
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,580
'If you stay there, you'll die of cold,' Norton
said.

238
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,940
'Wait there - we're coming to get you.'

239
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,380
Very carefully, Somervell climbed across the
steep slope, towards the four porters.

240
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,730
He had a rope round his waist.

241
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,160
Mallory and Norton held the rope from below,
to keep Somervell safe.

242
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,780
But when he was five metres away from the
porters, Somervell reached the end of the

243
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,250
rope.

244
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,620
'What do I do now?' he thought.

245
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,500
'We have no more rope, and it will soon be
dark.'

246
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:04,050
'Come across!' he called out to the porters.

247
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,960
'It's not far.

248
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,420
Carefully, one at a time.'

249
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,480
The first two porters reached Somervell safely.

250
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,590
Then they climbed past him, holding the rope,
towards Norton and Mallory.

251
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,890
Somervell looked at the last two porters.

252
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,320
'Come on,' he said.

253
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,090
'It's not difficult.

254
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,520
One at a time.'

255
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,370
But the porters were afraid, and both started
together.

256
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,780
A second later they slipped and fell.

257
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:44,260
They slid past Somervell down the slope, towards
the valley thousands of metres below.

258
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,180
But then, a few metres from the edge of the
slope, they stopped.

259
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,550
'Don't move,' Somervell said.

260
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,050
'Just wait for me.'

261
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,560
He drove his ice axe deep into the snow.

262
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,620
He untied the rope from his waist, and passed
it round the head of the ice axe.

263
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,480
Then, holding his end of the rope with one
hand, Somervell climbed down until he could

264
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,310
just reach the men with his other hand.

265
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,660
He pulled up the first man, then the second.

266
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,910
They climbed along the rope to Mallory and
Norton.

267
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,280
Somervell tied the rope round his waist again,
and climbed back after them.

268
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,310
Even now they were not safe.

269
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:41,120
It was nearly dark, and a long way above Camp
3.

270
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,740
One of the porters, Namgya, could not use
his hands, because he had bad frostbite.

271
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:56,660
But at last they reached Camp 3, where two
more climbers, Noel and Odell, were waiting

272
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,980
with warm food.

273
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,350
All the climbers were exhausted.

274
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:10,510
Mallory and Somervell could not stop coughing,
and Norton's feet hurt badly.

275
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,080
Helping the four porters had made them very,
very tired.

276
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,450
And they were nowhere near the summit of Everest.

277
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,190
Slowly they went down to Camp 1.

278
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:42,940
They needed time to rest, and to decide what
to do next.

279
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:51,280
CHAPTER SIX
Somervell and Norton - 1924

280
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,890
Norton decided that two pairs of climbers
would try to reach the summit, without oxygen.

281
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,750
Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce would go first,
and Norton and Somervell would follow the

282
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,960
next day.

283
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:18,290
The climbers would find a place for Camp 5
above 7,600 metres, and for Camp 6 at 8,231

284
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,440
metres.

285
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:28,310
Odell and Irvine would go up to Camp 4, to
help the climbers when they came down.

286
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:35,100
On 1 June Mallory and Bruce climbed up to
Camp 4 with nine porters.

287
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:43,900
The next day was clear and sunny, but above
the North Col they met a terrible icy wind.

288
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,640
It was difficult to stand, hardly possible
to walk.

289
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,990
Only five porters continued with Mallory and
Bruce.

290
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:04,510
At 7,600 metres, they found a place for two
small tents on a steep slope - Camp 5.

291
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:11,610
All that night they shivered in their sleeping
bags, while the wind tried to blow their tents

292
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,580
into the air.

293
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,680
Next morning they were all ill.

294
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,610
Only one porter was able to go on.

295
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,080
Sadly, they decided to come down.

296
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,810
As they went down, they passed Norton and
Somervell with four more porters, coming up.

297
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:39,590
These men reached Camp 5, and spent a better
night there.

298
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:46,230
The wind was less strong, and they managed
to cook, eat and sleep.

299
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:55,760
It was very, very cold, and in the thin air,
with no oxygen, it was difficult to move.

300
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,930
But next morning, three porters - Napboo Yishay,
Lhakpa Chedi, and Semchumbi - were ready to

301
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,340
go on.

302
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:14,550
They climbed on, up to 8,170 metres - higher
than any man had been before.

303
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:23,100
Here, at 1.30 p.m., they put up one tiny tent
- Camp 6.

304
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:30,370
Then the porters went down to the North Col,
while Norton and Somervell got ready for the

305
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,370
night.

306
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:39,910
As it grew dark, they wondered: can a man
sleep, without oxygen, at this height?

307
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,160
Yes!

308
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,620
It was 'the best night since I left Camp 1,'
Norton wrote.

309
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,400
So at 6.45 next morning the two men set out
for the summit.

310
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,530
They climbed slowly, taking three or four
breaths for every step.

311
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:06,340
They stayed a little below the ridge, to keep
out of the wind.

312
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:13,390
But in the shadow of the mountain, out of
the sun, it was very cold.

313
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:19,160
Norton shivered all the time, and he was having
trouble with his eyes.

314
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:26,040
Somervell coughed a lot, and his bad throat
made it difficult to breathe.

315
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,880
By midday they were at 8,536 metres.

316
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:40,070
The view was wonderful - they were above the
clouds, with a sea of mountains below them.

317
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,900
But Somervell was exhausted.

318
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,540
His throat was worse; he could hardly breathe.

319
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,750
So Norton went on alone.

320
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,420
He was moving more and more slowly, on a steep
slope like the roof of a house.

321
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:06,240
There were large stones and soft snow under
his feet; it was easy to fall.

322
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:16,390
And below him - 2,743 metres straight down,
in the thin clear air - was the East Rongbuk

323
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,910
Glacier and Camp 3.

324
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,830
He looked up.

325
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:30,840
He was about 275 metres below the summit,
but they were vertical metres - metres measured

326
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,800
up the mountain, not along it.

327
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,720
But he was tired, and moving very slowly.

328
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,370
And his eyes were getting worse.

329
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:47,380
Sometimes he saw two ice axes in his hand,
not one.

330
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,740
He knew that it was possible.

331
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,510
He could get to the summit - but he could
not get back.

332
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:02,890
Norton was nearer the summit than any man
before him.

333
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:10,800
But at 8,575 metres, he decided to turn back
towards Somervell.

334
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,130
It was the right thing to do.

335
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,860
Halfway down to Camp 5, Somervell stopped.

336
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:24,480
There was something in his throat - for nearly
a minute he could not breathe at all.

337
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,630
Then he coughed up a ball of blood, and could
breathe again.

338
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:42,220
When they reached Camp 4, Norton could not
see at all.

339
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:49,650
CHAPTER SEVEN
Mallory and Irvine - 1924

340
00:31:49,650 --> 00:32:01,400
But to Norton's surprise, there were two more
climbers at Camp 4 - Mallory and Irvine.

341
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,900
Mallory had decided to try again - with oxygen
this time.

342
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:14,340
Irvine was young, and he had not climbed many
mountains, but he understood the oxygen equipment

343
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,700
better than anyone.

344
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:23,090
So Mallory decided to climb with him.

345
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,120
On 6 June they set out for Camp 5.

346
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,100
Eight porters carried food and oxygen.

347
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,090
Next day they went on to Camp 6 with four
porters.

348
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:43,970
There, Mallory sent them back down with a
note to Noel, who was filming the expedition:

349
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,710
Dear Noel,

350
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,870
We'll probably start early tomorrow (8th)
in order to have clear weather.

351
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,830
It won't be too early to start looking out
for us either crossing the rock band under

352
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:04,550
the pyramid or going up skyline at 8.00 p.m.

353
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:12,050
Yours ever, G. Mallory

354
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:18,640
Behind them, Odell climbed up to Camp 5 with
food to help them when they came down.

355
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,800
Mallory left a note for him too, asking him
to wait at Camp 4 the next evening.

356
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,760
The weather was fine, he said, but the oxygen
was very heavy to carry.

357
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,309
Odell was climbing alone, without oxygen.

358
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:44,530
He spent the night at Camp 5 and then climbed
up towards Camp 6.

359
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:52,460
At 7,900 metres he found some very old rocks.

360
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:59,630
Studying rocks was Odell's job, and the rocks
that he found showed him that Everest had

361
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,270
once been under the sea.

362
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:12,370
At 12.50 p.m., the clouds cleared above him,
and he could see the summit ridge of Everest.

363
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:19,859
High on the ridge, he saw two tiny black dots
moving on the snow.

364
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,640
They climbed quickly, to the top of a rock
step near the summit.

365
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:31,980
Then the clouds came back and they disappeared.

366
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,940
It was Mallory and Irvine, climbing strongly
towards the summit.

367
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,019
But Odell thought they were a little late.

368
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:48,950
Was there enough time for them to get to the
summit and then down to Camp 6 that night?

369
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:54,889
He climbed up to Camp 6 and left some food
for them in the tent.

370
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,269
Then he climbed higher, towards the summit,
calling out for them.

371
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:02,999
But no one answered.

372
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,300
He wondered what to do.

373
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,609
He wanted to stay, but the tiny tent at Camp
6 was too small for three men.

374
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,940
So, at 4.30 p.m., he went down.

375
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:22,300
By 7.00 p.m. he was in Camp 4.

376
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,700
The next day was 9 June.

377
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,099
Odell was worried.

378
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:34,809
When he looked up the mountain, he could see
the tents of Camps 5 and 6, but nothing - and

379
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:39,030
nobody - was moving.

380
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,369
So Odell, with two porters, climbed up again
to Camp 5.

381
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:48,990
There was a strong wind all night.

382
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:56,380
The porters shivered in their tent, and next
morning they refused to move.

383
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,489
So Odell went on alone, up to Camp 6.

384
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:02,489
But no one was there.

385
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:09,619
The tent was closed, the food was still there.

386
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,779
Mallory and Irvine had disappeared.

387
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:21,760
For two hours Odell climbed on, above Camp
6, towards the summit.

388
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,130
What was he thinking?

389
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:31,739
Mallory and Irvine were probably dead, but
perhaps - just perhaps - one of them was still

390
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:35,710
alive, badly injured up there.

391
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:42,630
Perhaps he could see something, or find something,
and return with some answers.

392
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,239
But he saw nothing, and found no bodies.

393
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,599
Sadly, he turned back.

394
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:58,089
At Camp 6, he went into the tent, and pulled
out two black sleeping bags.

395
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:04,640
He put them on the snow in the shape of a
T. It was a message to the others, far below,

396
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,700
that Mallory and Irvine were dead.

397
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,720
But what happened to them?

398
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,049
Did they reach the summit before they died?

399
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:20,299
Or did they turn back, like Norton and Somervell?

400
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:22,329
No one knows.

401
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:29,900
When Odell last saw them it was already 12.50
in the afternoon.

402
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,609
But they were moving quickly, he said.

403
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:39,319
So perhaps they went on to the summit, and
then were too tired to find Camp 6 before

404
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,480
dark.

405
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,559
Perhaps, in the darkness, one of them fell,
and the other died trying to help him.

406
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,880
Perhaps they both fell together.

407
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,950
Or perhaps, with no more oxygen, they were
just too cold and tired to move any more,

408
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,069
and lay down in the snow to sleep.

409
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:22,950
It was seventy-five years before some of these
questions were answered.

410
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,349
CHAPTER EIGHT
To the South Col -1953

411
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:37,720
After 1950 Western climbers could no longer
enter Tibet, but they could enter Nepal.

412
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:47,039
In 1951 a British expedition went to the southern
side of Everest for the first time, and in

413
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:54,499
1952 a Swiss climber called Raymond Lambert
made an attempt on the summit with Tenzing

414
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,480
Norgay.

415
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,499
Tenzing was one of the Sherpa people of Nepal,
who are excellent climbers and know the mountains

416
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,249
well.

417
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:12,079
Together Lambert and Tenzing almost reached
the summit, but their oxygen equipment was

418
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:20,119
not working well, and at the highest camp
they had no sleeping bags.

419
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:33,069
So at 8,597 metres - just a few metres higher
than Norton had gone in 1924 - they turned

420
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,200
back.

421
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:44,440
In 1953 John Hunt came to Kathmandu, the capital
of Nepal, with a large British expedition.

422
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:53,130
Tenzing Norgay joined them here, and the expedition
set out for Thyangboche, a monastery south

423
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,609
of Everest.

424
00:39:55,609 --> 00:40:04,049
The walk took seventeen days, and 350 porters
were needed to carry their equipment.

425
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:12,569
In Thyangboche, they were joined by two New
Zealand climbers - Edmund Hillary and George

426
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:15,170
Lowe.

427
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:22,559
The climbers spent three weeks at Base Camp,
getting used to the thin mountain air.

428
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:30,930
They climbed smaller mountains of about 6,000
metres, learning to use the oxygen equipment.

429
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:36,940
John Hunt thought that Tenzing Norgay was
stronger than anyone.

430
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:46,900
Their first problem was to find a way up the
Khumbu Icefall onto the Khumbu Glacier.

431
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:54,859
The Khumbu Glacier is a slow-moving river
of ice, and the Khumbu Icefall is a large

432
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:58,349
wall of broken ice.

433
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:07,309
This icefall is over 300 metres high - six
times higher than Niagara Falls - and the

434
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:13,910
ice in it moves, very slowly, all the time.

435
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:20,349
There are pieces of ice as big as houses,
which could fall on the climbers' heads at

436
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,119
any moment.

437
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,210
There are avalanches of ice that could kill
a man in a second.

438
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:36,760
Terrible crevasses go hundreds of metres down
into the blue-green darkness under the climbers'

439
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,099
feet.

440
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:45,369
Sometimes the climbers heard ice moving far
below them.

441
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:53,220
The climbers and Sherpas carried loads of
over 18 kilograms up this difficult route.

442
00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:04,210
They made Camp 2 halfway up the icefall at
5,915 metres, and Camp 3 at the top of the

443
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:09,049
icefall, at 6,158 metres.

444
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:24,970
Then they climbed up the glacier to Camp 4
at 6,462 metres, and Camp 5 at 6,705 metres.

445
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:33,640
The next big problem was to climb the Lhotse
Face to the South Col. High above Camp 5 is

446
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,869
the mountain of Lhotse, 8,500 metres.

447
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:44,299
To the left of Lhotse is the South Col of
Everest.

448
00:42:44,299 --> 00:42:51,900
The first 600 metres of the Lhotse Face is
a steep slope of ice - the Lhotse Glacier.

449
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:59,039
This ice is very difficult to climb, with
many ice walls and deep crevasses.

450
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:08,859
For eleven long days the New Zealander George
Lowe and the Sherpa Annullu fought their way

451
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:12,229
up this wall of ice.

452
00:43:12,229 --> 00:43:21,369
All the way, they cut steps in the ice and
fixed ropes for the others to follow them.

453
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:30,710
They made Camp 6 at 7,010 metres, and Camp
7 at 7,315 metres.

454
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:40,160
Then they began to climb to the left, across
a wide snow slope, towards the South Col.

455
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,160
But the weather was terrible, and they were
very tired.

456
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,260
High winds blew down on them from the South
Col.

457
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,049
After twelve days of this, George Lowe was
exhausted.

458
00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:08,009
But on 21 May, Annullu and Wilfrid Noyce finally
managed to cross the difficult snow slope

459
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:17,150
and reach the South Col, at 7,925 metres.

460
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:24,920
Next day, Hillary, Tenzing, and seventeen
Sherpas followed them up to the South Col.

461
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:33,410
The Sherpas had only a cup of tea for breakfast
at Camp 7, after a long cold night.

462
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:39,049
They were carrying loads of 22 kilograms with
no oxygen.

463
00:44:39,049 --> 00:44:44,109
At the South Col, they made Camp 8.

464
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:49,369
Then, the same day, they went down again to
Camp 4.

465
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:59,170
They had climbed for ten hours with no food
or drink all day.

466
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,269
But Camp 8, on the South Col, was ready at
last.

467
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:14,700
Now the attempt on the summit could begin.

468
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:25,310
CHAPTER NINE
The South Summit - 1953

469
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:37,790
On 22 May, the first two summit climbers,
Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, set out

470
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:46,579
from Camp 4 to the South Col. John Hunt and
two Sherpas went with them, carrying heavy

471
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,670
loads.

472
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:53,670
Using oxygen, the three British men reached
the Col first.

473
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:00,319
But they were very tired, and when they took
off their oxygen equipment they could not

474
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,650
think clearly.

475
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:08,480
It took them over an hour to put up a tent
in the terrible wind.

476
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,519
When the Sherpas arrived, they collapsed in
the tent and could not move.

477
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:23,779
They rested for a day, then John Hunt and
the Sherpa Da Namgyal set out to climb higher.

478
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:29,310
They both had oxygen and were carrying about
20 kilograms.

479
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:37,070
They moved very slowly, and Bourdillon and
Evans soon came past them.

480
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:43,119
Hunt and Da Namgyal both had problems with
their oxygen.

481
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,650
Sometimes ice stopped it working, and it was
very difficult to breathe.

482
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:56,440
On they went, more and more slowly.

483
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,579
At 8,338 metres Hunt and Da Namgyal could
go no further.

484
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:05,680
They put down their loads and turned back.

485
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,029
When they reached the South Col, they could
hardly walk.

486
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:15,109
Above them, Bourdillon and Evans went on.

487
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:23,229
At 1 o'clock they reached the South Summit,
8,750 metres.

488
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:26,619
In front of them they could see the final
summit ridge.

489
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:30,930
It was a view no man had ever seen before.

490
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:39,869
To the left, a steep rocky slope fell 2,400
metres down to Camp 4 on the glacier.

491
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:48,440
To the right, there was a line of white snow
cornices over a drop of 2,500 metres.

492
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,809
Should they go on?

493
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:55,810
This was their one chance to get to the top.

494
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:03,400
But was it safe, or would they die, like Mallory
and Irvine before them?

495
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:09,489
They stood, and looked, and thought.

496
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:13,079
Evans had already had trouble with his oxygen.

497
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:18,910
Bourdillon had fixed it, but they did not
have a lot of oxygen left.

498
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:25,969
They thought it would take three hours to
reach the summit, and two hours to get back

499
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,160
to the South Summit.

500
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:35,410
By then it would be 6 o'clock, and they would
have to climb down another 900 metres, without

501
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,269
oxygen, to Camp 8.

502
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:40,829
It was too far.

503
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:45,400
So, sadly, they turned back.

504
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,200
But it was the right thing to do.

505
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,680
The wind grew stronger, and clouds came up.

506
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,769
It was difficult to find the way.

507
00:48:54,769 --> 00:49:01,299
They were very tired, and several times they
slipped on the way down.

508
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:05,059
At one point Evans slipped and fell.

509
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:09,999
He slid past Bourdillon like a bullet, and
pulled him off his feet.

510
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:16,589
A moment later they were both sliding down
the snow towards the glacier, thousands of

511
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:17,690
feet below.

512
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:25,769
Quickly, Bourdillon turned onto his face and
dug his ice axe into the snow.

513
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:32,529
The ice axe stopped them, but they had nearly
died.

514
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:36,630
Was this what happened to Mallory and Irvine,
twenty-nine years earlier?

515
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,630
they wondered.

516
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:44,329
A sudden fall, on the way down, and no one
to help?

517
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,339
It could happen so easily.

518
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:52,969
When they reached Camp 8 they were exhausted.

519
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:58,509
Their faces were covered with ice, and they
could hardly walk.

520
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:05,569
'They looked like strangers from another planet,'
John Hunt said.

521
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:21,960
But they had climbed higher than any man before
them.

522
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,400
CHAPTER TEN
On top of the world - 1953

523
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:36,060
Hillary and Tenzing were already at Camp 8,
together with John Hunt, Da Namgyal, and Ang

524
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,099
Temba.

525
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,980
Gregory and Lowe were there too, with three
more Sherpas.

526
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,529
But the weather was bad.

527
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:53,980
A terrible wind blew straight across the South
Col, and the temperature fell to -25 degrees.

528
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:00,289
Hillary said that it was one of the worst
nights he had ever lived through.

529
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,029
No one could sleep.

530
00:51:03,029 --> 00:51:08,720
They sat shivering in their tents, hoping
that the wind would not blow them away.

531
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:16,719
Bourdillon and Evans were exhausted, three
of the Sherpas were ill, and Hunt, like Ang

532
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:26,800
Temba and Da Namgyal, had now spent three
nights at 7,925 metres.

533
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,930
Next day, it was difficult for Bourdillon
to walk, so Evans, John Hunt, and Da Namgyal

534
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:37,660
helped him and Ang Temba down to Camp 7.

535
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:46,630
Gregory, Lowe, and three Sherpas spent another
night at Camp 8 with Hillary and Tenzing.

536
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:51,900
On the morning of 28 May the wind began to
fall.

537
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,450
Hillary and Tenzing got ready to set out.

538
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:03,579
Gregory and Lowe's job was to start first
and make Camp 9 somewhere below the South

539
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,700
Summit.

540
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:14,160
But two of their three Sherpas were ill, so
Lowe, Gregory, and Ang Nyima carried everything

541
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,499
between them.

542
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:22,660
With their oxygen, they carried about 18 kilograms
each.

543
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:30,789
Hillary and Tenzing followed at 10 a.m., carrying
about 22 kilograms each.

544
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:40,559
Then, at 8,338 metres, they found the loads
which Hunt and Da Namgyal had left, and picked

545
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,869
them up too.

546
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:47,549
Now they were carrying 27 kilograms each.

547
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:58,160
At 2.30 p.m. they found a small place for
Camp 9, at 8,506 metres.

548
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,779
Gregory, Lowe, and Ang Nyima dropped their
loads and went down.

549
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:11,559
Hillary and Tenzing put up their tent, and
crawled inside.

550
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,989
The wind was very strong, and they were afraid
the tent would blow away.

551
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:24,280
That night, the temperature fell to -27 degrees.

552
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,519
But by 4 a.m. the wind had stopped, and the
sky cleared.

553
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:36,759
When they opened the tent door, in the early
morning sun, they could see the monastery

554
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:45,910
at Thyangboche, 4,878 metres below, where
the monks were getting out of bed.

555
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:54,289
They melted snow for a warm drink, and checked
the oxygen equipment carefully.

556
00:53:54,289 --> 00:54:00,299
Tenzing had worn his boots all night, but
Hillary had taken his off, and they were as

557
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,660
hard as ice.

558
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,710
He had to heat them over the small cooker
to make them soft.

559
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:16,289
At 6.30 a.m. they set out, and by 9 a.m. they
reached the South Summit.

560
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:21,480
They sat down and studied the summit ridge
carefully.

561
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,640
It looked 'frightening', Hillary thought.

562
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,229
The snow cornices to the right were very dangerous.

563
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:38,299
They were like fingers of soft snow, 2,500
metres above the valley below.

564
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:44,029
And the rocks on the left looked very difficult
too.

565
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:48,599
But the snow just above the rocks looked better.

566
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,109
Perhaps it was possible to climb there.

567
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:56,910
As soon as they stepped onto the snow, they
were happy.

568
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:02,390
It was good hard snow, so cutting steps in
it was easy.

569
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:05,769
But it was still very dangerous.

570
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:10,950
One slip, and they could fall thousands of
metres.

571
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:16,150
Hillary went first, cutting steps in the snow.

572
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:22,499
Behind him, Tenzing put the rope around his
ice axe and dug it into the snow, to keep

573
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:23,599
them safe.

574
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:29,740
Then Hillary stopped, and Tenzing went first,
cutting steps.

575
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,999
First one man, then the other.

576
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:40,989
Several times their oxygen stopped working,
and they found it hard to breathe.

577
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:45,430
But each time they fixed it, and went on.

578
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,069
As the sun rose, they felt warmer.

579
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:55,640
'To my surprise, I was enjoying the climb,'
Hillary said later.

580
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:03,559
The weather was still fine, and they could
see the tents of Camp 4, 2,439 metres below.

581
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:11,469
But halfway up the ridge, they met a problem.

582
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:15,780
They reached a rock wall, 17 metres high.

583
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,469
It looked difficult and dangerous to climb.

584
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:27,759
On the left it was clean rock; on the right,
the wind had blown a cornice of hard snow

585
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,140
against it.

586
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:35,989
Hillary pushed his boot into a hole between
the rock and the snow.

587
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:42,380
He began to climb with his back to the rock,
hoping that the snow did not move.

588
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,709
At last he reached the top of the wall, and
Tenzing followed him up.

589
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:55,210
Now, there were just 220 vertical metres to
go.

590
00:56:55,210 --> 00:57:00,880
Slowly, cutting steps in the snow, they climbed
on.

591
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:08,259
Even with oxygen, they had to take two or
three breaths after every step.

592
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:14,099
Each time they thought they had reached the
summit, they saw another one higher.

593
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,560
They were both tired.

594
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:23,130
'The ridge seemed never-ending,' Hillary wrote
later.

595
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:29,339
But then, quite suddenly, it did end.

596
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:34,869
They looked around, and realised they could
not go any higher.

597
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:42,319
It was 11.30 a.m, and they had reached the
summit of Everest.

598
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:48,799
They shook hands and threw their arms round
each other.

599
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:56,249
Hillary took out a camera and took a picture
- THE picture - of Tenzing on top of Everest,

600
00:57:56,249 --> 00:58:00,910
the highest man in the world.

601
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:09,700
On his ice axe Tenzing had the flags of Great
Britain, Nepal, India, and the United Nations.

602
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:17,339
Hillary took pictures of the view north, south,
east, and west.

603
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:20,950
Tenzing made a small hole in the snow.

604
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:27,550
In it he put some sweets, a pencil which his
daughter had given him, and the flags from

605
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,130
the ice axe.

606
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:35,599
Hillary made a hole too, and put a small crucifix
in there.

607
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:43,059
They gave these things to the mountain Chomolungma
- 'Goddess Mother of the World.'

608
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:55,869
They were on top of the world - but were they
really the first men who had ever been there?

609
00:58:55,869 --> 00:59:02,459
For a few minutes, Hillary and Tenzing searched,
to see if Mallory and Irvine had left anything

610
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:06,319
up there twenty-nine years ago.

611
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,950
They found nothing, but that was not surprising.

612
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:14,739
Every few days, there is new snow on the mountain.

613
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:23,200
Every month, winds of over 150 kilometres
per hour blow across the top of Everest, adding

614
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:28,589
more snow, burying what was there before.

615
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:31,119
After fifteen minutes they turned back.

616
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,880
They needed to get down before they used all
the oxygen.

617
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,009
They went carefully; it would be stupid to
have an accident now.

618
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:49,630
An hour later they were at the South Summit;
by evening they were with George Lowe at the

619
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:55,989
South Col. Next day they were down at Camp
4.

620
00:59:55,989 --> 01:00:04,440
Only two men had reached the summit - one
from New Zealand, one from Nepal.

621
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,191
But everyone in the expedition was happy.

622
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:13,779
They had done something no one had ever done
before.

623
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:32,519
But each man in the expedition had needed
the help of all the others.

624
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:41,599
CHAPTER ELEVEN
One man alone - 1980

625
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:49,930
Since 1953, many hundreds of men and women
have climbed Everest, most of them in large

626
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,210
expeditions.

627
01:00:52,210 --> 01:01:01,499
Some groups have been very large indeed - in
1975 a Chinese expedition with 400 people

628
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:06,640
managed to send nine climbers to the summit.

629
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,440
They left a small metal tripod there, fixed
to the rock.

630
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:20,519
In 1985 a Norwegian expedition sent seventeen
people to the top.

631
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,619
All these climbers, like Hillary and Tenzing,
needed the help of many others.

632
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:30,739
Almost all of them used oxygen, too.

633
01:01:30,739 --> 01:01:36,140
People have climbed Everest from the south,
north, and west.

634
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:44,789
But the first climber to climb the mountain
all alone, with no oxygen at all, was Reinhold

635
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:45,969
Messner.

636
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:57,119
In 1978 two climbers, Reinhold Messner and
Peter Habeler, joined a large German-Austrian

637
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,089
expedition climbing from Nepal.

638
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:08,769
Most of the expedition were using oxygen but
Messner and Habeler decided to climb without

639
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:09,769
it.

640
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:19,089
After 'the success of Hillary and Tenzing
in 1953 using oxygen,' Messner said, 'the

641
01:02:19,089 --> 01:02:25,809
whole world thought that this must be the
only way.'

642
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:29,150
But the early climbers did not think so.

643
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:37,699
In 1924, Norton climbed to 8,575 metres with
no oxygen.

644
01:02:37,699 --> 01:02:48,970
So, Messner thought, perhaps it is possible
to climb 273 metres more.

645
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,490
He tried twice.

646
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:59,449
The first time he reached the South Col with
two Sherpas, but they were caught in a terrible

647
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,619
storm.

648
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:07,869
Their tent nearly collapsed in the wind, and
they spent two nights without eating or drinking

649
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:11,569
before they came down.

650
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:19,509
But a few days later Messner tried again,
with Peter Habeler, and in ten hours they

651
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:24,940
climbed from the South Col to the summit,
with no oxygen at all.

652
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:30,250
But back at the South Col, they were very
ill.

653
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,120
Habeler had a terrible headache.

654
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:41,130
Messner had taken off his goggles to make
a film, and the bright snow had hurt his eyes.

655
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:50,910
Just like Norton in 1924, he lay in his tent
all night, unable to see anything.

656
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:59,549
The two men needed help to climb down from
the South Col next day.

657
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:05,719
Two years later, in 1980, Messner began a
new attempt.

658
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:12,239
This time he went through Tibet, like Norton
and Mallory in 1924.

659
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:18,130
But Messner did not take a lot of heavy equipment
and hundreds of porters.

660
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:24,719
He just went with his girlfriend, Nena, and
two Chinese people came with them to show

661
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:25,819
them the way.

662
01:04:25,819 --> 01:04:35,079
They started at the same place as the British
Base Camp in 1924, then, with three yaks,

663
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:41,979
they climbed to Camp 3 at 6,500 metres on
the East Rongbuk Glacier.

664
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:50,670
Then the two Chinese went back to Base Camp,
while Nena and Messner stayed at Camp 3 for

665
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,200
ten days, getting used to the height.

666
01:04:54,200 --> 01:05:00,940
On 24 July Messner climbed to the North Col,
at 7,000 metres.

667
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:09,519
But he felt very tired, and there was too
much soft snow.

668
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:18,640
So he and Nena returned to Base Camp and spent
three weeks walking and climbing above 5,000

669
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,089
metres.

670
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:26,710
Each day they grew stronger, and breathed
more easily in the thin mountain air.

671
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:37,130
On 15 August they returned to Camp 3, and
on 17 August Messner climbed up to the North

672
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:41,299
Col again, much faster than before.

673
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:45,349
Now he was ready, he thought.

674
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:48,809
He came down to Camp 3 to sleep.

675
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:53,469
That night he ate and drank, and slept for
a while.

676
01:05:53,469 --> 01:06:01,589
Then he got up, dressed carefully, and packed
his rucksack with everything he needed - food

677
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:08,359
for a week, a small cooker, tent, sleeping
bag, camera.

678
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:16,619
He had a head torch, to see in the dark, two
ski sticks, crampons, and a strong, light

679
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,059
ice axe.

680
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:26,410
He touched Nena's face gently with his lips,
and stepped out of the tent into the night.

681
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:32,029
'I shall be thinking of you,' she said sleepily.

682
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,489
'Bye bye.'

683
01:06:34,489 --> 01:06:36,949
'Bye bye.'

684
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:43,400
The words came out of the night, and then
he was gone.

685
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,880
An hour later, he nearly died.

686
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:55,190
When he was 500 metres above the camp, the
snow suddenly collapsed under his feet and

687
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,329
he fell into a crevasse.

688
01:06:57,329 --> 01:07:02,380
His head torch went out, and everything was
dark.

689
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,539
He had decided not to take a radio with him.

690
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,700
Now he was frightened.

691
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:14,079
He could see nothing, and it was not possible
to call for help.

692
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,910
Then the torch came on again.

693
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:26,400
He was standing on a snow bridge, about 1
metre square, above a deep black hole.

694
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,769
He looked round.

695
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:33,039
There was a small ice ridge to the left, going
up.

696
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:41,369
But to climb that, he needed crampons on his
boots; and his crampons were in his rucksack.

697
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:47,469
Very carefully, he got them out and put them
on.

698
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:53,630
Carefully, he reached forward across the crevasse
with his arms.

699
01:07:53,630 --> 01:08:01,950
Then he stepped across onto the ridge - right
foot first, then left.

700
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:05,609
The crampons held in the ice.

701
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:12,410
Slowly, he climbed up, out of the crevasse,
into the night.

702
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:17,940
Far below, Nena was still sleeping in the
tent.

703
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:27,089
He climbed on, up to the North Col. As the
sun came out, the clouds and mountains turned

704
01:08:27,089 --> 01:08:30,839
from dark blue to yellow and then pink.

705
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:34,880
There was good hard snow under his feet.

706
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:43,460
He climbed quickly, taking fifty steps, then
resting, then taking fifty more.

707
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,850
The ski sticks made climbing easier.

708
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:52,230
As he climbed, Messner thought about Mallory
and Irvine.

709
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:58,990
They had come the same way up the mountain,
long ago.

710
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:05,210
They had oxygen, but their clothes and equipment
were much heavier than Messner's.

711
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:15,920
Mallory and Irvine had no light tents and
sleeping bags, no crampons, no ski sticks.

712
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:22,080
But when Odell last saw them, they were high
up on the North Ridge.

713
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,910
Two tiny black dots on the snow, going strongly.

714
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,500
Did they reach the summit, he wondered.

715
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,069
Or did they die before that?

716
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:44,160
Far below him, Nena stood outside the tent,
watching Messner climb higher and higher.

717
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,970
To her, he was now a tiny black dot on the
snow.

718
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:55,250
'I would like to climb with him,' she wrote
in her diary.

719
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,820
'One day perhaps, I tell myself...

720
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:06,850
The further he is from me, the stronger becomes
my love.'

721
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,440
By 9 a.m.

722
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,820
Messner was at 7,360 metres.

723
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:18,550
He was tired, and had to rest every thirty
steps.

724
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:26,930
Up here, the thin dry air had only one third
as much oxygen as at sea level.

725
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:34,730
His throat hurt, and for long moments he could
think of nothing but breathing.

726
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:39,590
'Still a bit more, you can do it,' he told
himself.

727
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:44,230
'What you climb today, you won't have to climb
tomorrow.'

728
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:55,720
At last, at 7,800 metres, high up on the North
Ridge, he decided to stop.

729
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,100
The view from here was wonderful.

730
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,260
Some of the highest mountains in the Himalayas
were below him.

731
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:13,640
And 1,300 metres below, he could see the tiny
red dot of Nena's tent.

732
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:18,140
He took a long, long time to put up his tent.

733
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:22,850
Again and again, the wind almost blew it away.

734
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:28,510
He held it down with his ski sticks and ice
axe.

735
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:35,130
Then he pushed his rucksack inside and crawled
in after it.

736
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,140
But he could not rest.

737
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,940
To get water, he had to melt snow with his
small stove.

738
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:48,640
His throat hurt, but he had to make himself
drink.

739
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,600
He was not hungry, but he had to cook and
make himself eat.

740
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,750
And that night, a storm came up.

741
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:02,210
The temperature fell to -20 degrees.

742
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:09,870
Winds of over 80 kilometres per hour tried
to blow the tent off the mountain.

743
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:15,800
Next morning the wind had fallen, but Messner
felt terribly tired.

744
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:23,270
For an hour he lay in his tent, half asleep,
unable to move.

745
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:31,760
Every small thing - making a drink, eating,
putting on his boots - was hard work.

746
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,350
He had to argue with himself.

747
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:38,470
'You must go on,' he told himself.

748
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:44,880
Then, a minute later: 'Why don't I go down?'

749
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,310
But he knew the answer to that.

750
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:50,770
'I wanted to make the climb.

751
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:54,420
I still want to.'

752
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,230
He took the tent down and packed his rucksack.

753
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:03,000
The sky was blue, the sun was shining.

754
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,100
But as he set out, the clouds and wind came
back.

755
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:14,400
His legs were tired, and his 18 kilogram rucksack
seemed heavier than before.

756
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:19,810
Every fifteen steps now, he stopped to rest.

757
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:27,540
There was too much new snow on the ridge,
so he moved down onto the rocky north face

758
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,700
- the same way that Norton had gone, also
without oxygen.

759
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:38,630
The rocks sloped steeply like the roof on
a church.

760
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:44,090
It was very quiet, but Messner began to hear
voices.

761
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:49,810
'Is that somebody talking nearby?' he wondered.

762
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:53,190
'Is somebody there?...

763
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,580
I believe I hear voices.

764
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,600
Perhaps it is Mallory and Irvine!'

765
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:08,170
By 3 o'clock in the afternoon he was at 8,220
metres.

766
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:11,480
He was too tired to go on any more.

767
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,590
He could only take ten steps now before resting.

768
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:21,890
He found a flat piece of snow above a large
rock, and put up his tent there.

769
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:27,450
He took a picture of the tent, then got inside
his sleeping bag.

770
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:31,880
Again, he had to melt snow to get water.

771
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,230
And it was difficult to sleep.

772
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:42,640
Even when he was resting in the tent, his
heart was beating 100 times a minute.

773
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:49,000
Next morning he could see little - he was
in the clouds.

774
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,920
Should he go on, or wait, he wondered.

775
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,190
No, he thought, he couldn't wait.

776
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,960
'It's now or never.

777
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,960
Either-or.

778
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,100
I must either go up or go down.

779
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:12,900
There is no other choice.'

780
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:16,920
He decided to leave the tent and rucksack
behind.

781
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:22,430
He put the camera in his pocket, picked up
his ice axe, and set out.

782
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:25,990
It was harder to climb without the ski sticks.

783
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:33,310
He was afraid that he would fall, so he often
climbed on hands and knees.

784
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:38,170
As he climbed up to the ridge, it became steeper.

785
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:47,150
Often, he dug his ice axe into the snow above
his head, and lay on his face, resting.

786
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:51,120
For three hours he crawled slowly along the
ridge.

787
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,830
His dry throat felt like wood.

788
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:59,860
'Where is the summit?' he wondered.

789
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,520
He could see almost nothing.

790
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:09,190
Then, suddenly, the cloud cleared, and he
could see right down to the glacier in the

791
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,190
valley.

792
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:15,390
He took a few photos, then the cloud came
back.

793
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,480
'Where is the summit?' he wondered.

794
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,000
'At most it can only be another ten metres
up to the top!'

795
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,860
He crawled on, always upwards.

796
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:32,620
Then, suddenly, there it was.

797
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:40,100
The metal tripod, which the Chinese had fixed
to the summit in 1975 - it was there in front

798
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,240
of him!

799
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:49,350
Messner had seen it before, in 1978; now he
took hold of it, like an old friend.

800
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,900
He had done it!

801
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:58,720
He was on top of the world, with nothing above
him but sky.

802
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,600
He sat down, like a stone.

803
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,790
All he wanted to do was rest.

804
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,320
But it was after 3 o'clock.

805
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,800
He could not stay here in the dark.

806
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,730
Slowly, he got up.

807
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,210
He took a few photos.

808
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,750
Then, at 4 o'clock, he turned to go.

809
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,560
'I must get back down,' he thought.

810
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:27,940
'Half an hour too late means the end of me.'

811
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:33,270
On the way down he started coughing badly.

812
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:38,310
When he reached the tent he lay in his sleeping
bag like a dead man.

813
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,810
But he could not sleep.

814
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:46,150
He melted a little snow to drink, but ate
nothing.

815
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:49,810
Next morning, he left the tent where it was.

816
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:56,780
Carrying the ski sticks and rucksack, he came
down the mountain like a man walking in his

817
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,080
sleep.

818
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,440
Twice he slipped and fell.

819
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:06,670
Each time, he turned on his face and dug his
ice axe into the snow.

820
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:14,560
Then suddenly, on the glacier, he saw Nena
standing in front of him.

821
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,230
Resting on his ski sticks, he looked at her.

822
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,350
Was she really there?

823
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,710
Yes, she was.

824
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:26,960
'Reinhold, how are you?'

825
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,590
she said.

826
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,780
She ran towards him.

827
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,810
Messner fell to his knees.

828
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:34,840
He was crying.

829
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,270
Nena held him in her arms.

830
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,580
'Everything's OK, Reinhold,' she said.

831
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,580
'You are all right.

832
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,170
The camp is over there.'

833
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:50,170
'Where are all my friends?' he asked.

834
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:52,140
'I'm your friend.

835
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,110
I'm here, Reinhold.

836
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:59,040
Don't worry, we're going to our camp now.'

837
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:05,390
'Yes, where is the camp actually?' he asked.

838
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:07,690
'Over there.'

839
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:11,210
She took his rucksack, and led him to the
camp.

840
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:15,650
Here, she gave him food and drink and let
him sleep.

841
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:23,090
All next day he lay in his sleeping bag without
moving, while Nena watched over him.

842
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:33,570
Reinhold Messner had climbed the highest mountain
in the world, all alone, with no oxygen.

843
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:37,240
But the mountain had beaten him too.

844
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:46,480
They both won this fight, the mountain and
the man.

845
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:51,651
CHAPTER TWELVE
The final question

846
01:19:51,651 --> 01:20:03,440
By 1999, many people, both men and women,
had climbed Everest.

847
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:12,699
They came from the USA, India, China, Japan,
Italy, and many more countries.

848
01:20:12,699 --> 01:20:21,220
One climber, Goran Kropp from Sweden, rode
his bicycle to Everest, climbed the mountain

849
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:24,770
without oxygen, and rode home again.

850
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:35,740
But still nobody had found an answer to the
question: what happened to Mallory and Irvine?

851
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:41,220
A climber called Jochen Hemmleb became interested
in this problem in 1988.

852
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:48,400
He studied the problem for years, and his
bedroom was full of books and photos of Everest.

853
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:54,800
But with every new piece of information, there
were new questions.

854
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:07,210
In 1924, Odell was at 7,926 metres, climbing
up behind Mallory and Irvine towards Camp

855
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,210
6.

856
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:16,270
At 12.50 p.m. the clouds cleared, and Odell
could see the summit ridge of Everest above

857
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,550
him.

858
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:24,350
High up on the ridge, he saw two tiny black
dots moving on the snow.

859
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:26,760
They were moving quickly.

860
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,500
He saw them climb a rock step on the ridge.

861
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:37,630
Then the clouds came back and they disappeared.

862
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:43,562
There are three rock steps on the north-east
ridge: the First Step, the Second Step, and

863
01:21:43,562 --> 01:21:44,562
the Third Step.

864
01:21:44,562 --> 01:21:52,570
The Second Step is much harder to climb than
the First and Third Steps.

865
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:58,750
It is a steep rock wall, like the front of
a ship.

866
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:10,600
But it is only about 250 vertical metres from
the summit; and the Third Step is even closer.

867
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:17,040
So the first question is: which of the three
steps were Mallory and Irvine climbing when

868
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,540
Odell last saw them?

869
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:27,980
In 1924, Odell said it was the 'rock step
at a very short distance from the base of

870
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,660
the final pyramid.'

871
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:33,990
And both of them climbed quickly to the top
of it.

872
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:40,460
It is difficult to climb the Second Step,
but much easier to climb the Third Step.

873
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:46,160
And the First Step is quite a long distance
from the summit.

874
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:56,220
So at 12.50 p.m., Mallory and Irvine were
probably at either the Second Step or the

875
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:02,720
Third Step - only 'a very short distance'
from the summit.

876
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:08,280
If that is right, did they stop there?

877
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,690
Probably not.

878
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:14,950
All the difficult parts of the climb were
behind them.

879
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:22,694
They had oxygen, and Odell said they were
'moving quickly.'

880
01:23:22,694 --> 01:23:26,890
So did they reach the summit, before they
died?

881
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:30,790
Many people think it is quite possible.

882
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:34,920
But others think Odell made a mistake.

883
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:40,230
'He only saw them for a moment,' they say.

884
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:48,480
'He probably saw them climb the First Step
- much further from the summit.'

885
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,910
Reinhold Messner agrees.

886
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:55,030
'Mallory did not climb the Second Step,' he
says.

887
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:59,670
'Odell saw them on the First Step.'

888
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,150
So who is right?

889
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:03,890
And how can we know?

890
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:16,370
In 1933, a British climber found Irvine's
ice axe at 8,460 metres, just below the First

891
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:18,800
Step.

892
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,190
But why was it there?

893
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:25,440
Did he put it down, or drop it in an accident?

894
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:32,460
And did this happen on the way up, or the
way down?

895
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,180
No one knows.

896
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:45,990
In 1960, a Chinese climber found an old wooden
tent post and rope, like those used in 1924,

897
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,720
just below the Second Step.

898
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:59,520
And in 1979 a Japanese climber met another
Chinese climber, Wang Hongbao, on the mountain,

899
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,520
and heard a strange story.

900
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:12,330
Four years earlier, Wang said, he had found
a body - 'an English dead' - near the Chinese

901
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:16,020
Camp 6, at 8,100 metres.

902
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:19,900
Was this Mallory, perhaps, or Irvine?

903
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:30,640
The Japanese climber wanted to ask more questions,
but the very next day, Wang himself was killed

904
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,680
in an avalanche.

905
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,390
So the questions continued.

906
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:43,760
In 1999, Jochen Hemmleb was part of an expedition
that set out to find some answers.

907
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:53,210
From Tibet, they climbed slowly up the East
Rongbuk Glacier to Camp 5, just under the

908
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:54,560
North East Ridge.

909
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:04,120
At 7,900 metres, one climber, Andy Politz,
reached the place where Odell had last seen

910
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,080
Mallory and Irvine far above him.

911
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:11,730
Where had they actually been, when he saw
them?

912
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:13,990
Politz looked up.

913
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:18,990
He could clearly see each of the First, Second
and Third Steps.

914
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:25,210
'You are really close to them at that point,'
he said.

915
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:32,780
'And there was only one place that (was) "a
very short distance from the base of the final

916
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:39,400
pyramid", and that was the Third Step - the
one nearest the summit.'

917
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:44,260
He took a lot of photographs and video film
to make this clear.

918
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:52,710
The five climbers reached Camp 6, near the
place where Wang Hongbao had seen the 'English

919
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,710
dead.'

920
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:59,460
On 1 May 1999, they set out to find the body
again.

921
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:07,870
They climbed across a steep snow slope, some
going up, others down.

922
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:10,130
It was a dangerous, frightening place.

923
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,260
A strong wind made it easy to fall.

924
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:23,280
After half an hour, they had found the bodies
of not one but six dead climbers.

925
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:28,420
All the dead bodies had broken arms or legs.

926
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:37,060
And the climbers knew that at any moment they
could fall and die too, like the men before

927
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,060
them.

928
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:45,920
But the dead bodies wore modern clothes, in
bright red or orange colours - very different

929
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,490
from the clothes that climbers wore in 1924.

930
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:57,440
Then Conrad Anker saw something white on the
rocks below him.

931
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,540
He climbed down carefully towards it.

932
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:07,470
Then he called the others on his radio.

933
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,860
'Come down here,' he said.

934
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,860
'Look at this.'

935
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:14,090
As soon as they saw it, they knew this body
was different.

936
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:17,290
This was no modern climber.

937
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:21,100
This man had been here for seventy-five years.

938
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:28,470
Some of his clothes were gone, blown away
by the wind, and his skin was white.

939
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:32,400
There was no oxygen equipment.

940
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:39,810
The rope around his waist had cut into the
skin, and was broken at one end where he had

941
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,810
fallen.

942
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:43,340
One leg was broken in two places.

943
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:47,030
His head and arms were cut.

944
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:51,920
They stood and looked at the body quietly
for a while.

945
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,760
They took photographs.

946
01:28:54,760 --> 01:29:00,080
Then, very gently, they began to look in the
pockets of the man's clothes.

947
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:05,440
One thing they hoped to find was a camera.

948
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:13,720
In 1924, when Mallory and Irvine set out for
the summit, Somervell gave Mallory a small

949
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,870
camera to take with him.

950
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:20,250
Did Mallory take photos at the summit, or
not?

951
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:23,480
The camera could give the answer.

952
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:30,450
In Mallory's pockets they found some sweets,
some letters from his brother and sister,

953
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:37,190
a knife, a broken watch, his snow goggles
- but no camera.

954
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:43,050
They looked carefully all around, but the
camera was not there.

955
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:47,920
It was too cold and dangerous to stay there
long.

956
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,831
But they did not want to leave the body as
it was.

957
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:59,180
For all of them, Mallory was a great man - one
of the first and bravest of all the men who

958
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,800
tried to climb Everest.

959
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,680
So, before they left, they decided to bury
his body.

960
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,550
They covered the body with big stones.

961
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,610
Then they said prayers over the body.

962
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:17,970
They had found one body, but they were still
looking for answers.

963
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:22,050
It was clear, though, that Mallory had stopped
using oxygen.

964
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:30,530
There was no oxygen equipment on his body,
so he probably threw it away when he had used

965
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:32,090
all the oxygen.

966
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:39,400
That means Mallory and Irvine did not turn
back early - like Bourdillon and Evans in

967
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:46,460
1953 - when they still had enough oxygen to
get back to Camp 6.

968
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:53,250
Probably they went on, trying to reach the
summit even when they knew it was dangerous.

969
01:30:53,250 --> 01:31:03,620
Mallory's snow goggles were in his pocket,
so perhaps he was coming down after dark.

970
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:09,280
The broken rope round Mallory's waist shows
that the two men were probably still climbing

971
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,390
down together.

972
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:20,540
The moon went down early that night, at 11.25
p.m.; after that there was only starlight

973
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,570
to help them.

974
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,600
They were tired, thirsty, and had no oxygen.

975
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:38,330
But they were only 400 metres from the tiny
tent at Camp 6, where Odell had left food.

976
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:42,540
They were almost safe.

977
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,340
And then - something happened.

978
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:48,200
Perhaps something like this:

979
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:52,720
They are climbing down together in the dark.

980
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:57,990
Irvine is going first, Mallory is behind.

981
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:01,140
Suddenly, Mallory slips and falls.

982
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,190
Irvine tries to save him but the rope breaks.

983
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:10,470
Mallory falls faster and faster.

984
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:13,540
When he hits the ground his leg breaks in
two places.

985
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,050
But he does not stop.

986
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:23,590
He is sliding down the steep slope, towards
the Rongbuk Glacier thousands of feet below.

987
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:30,920
He has dropped his ice axe, but he turns on
his face and digs his fingers into the snow

988
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,090
above his head, trying to slow down.

989
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:38,920
He stops, but he has hit his head on a rock.

990
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:47,180
He lies there, unable to move, dying alone
in the dark.

991
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:51,520
Somewhere far above him, Irvine is injured
too.

992
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:59,560
He calls to Mallory, again and again, but
there is no answer.

993
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:06,030
Slowly, he tries to crawl towards Camp 6,
but he cannot find it.

994
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:17,760
Alone, and lost in the dark and icy cold at
8,200 metres, Irvine dies too.

995
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,750
Did they reach the summit before they died?

996
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:30,920
Only Mallory's camera can answer that question,
and no one has found it.

997
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:37,570
But there is one other important thing which
no one has found.

998
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:46,070
When Mallory left England in 1924, he took
a photo of his wife, Ruth, with him.

999
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:51,480
And he made a promise to her, in words like
these.

1000
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,200
'I'll look at your photo every day.

1001
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,990
But I will not bring it back.

1002
01:33:56,990 --> 01:34:03,610
I'm going to take it with me to the summit
of Everest.

1003
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:13,240
When I get there, I'm going to bury your photograph
in the snow, on top of the highest mountain

1004
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:16,630
in the world.'

1005
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:24,180
The five climbers searched carefully for the
photograph of Mallory's wife in his pockets.

1006
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,180
But it was not there.

1007
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:25,200
- THE END -
