1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,080
The Irish are said to be good at parties,
noisy revels with drinking, singing, and dancing

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,280
late into the night.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,029
But Mary, seventeen and living on a lonely
farm, has no experience of them, and as she

4
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:32,439
cycles down the mountain road to her first
party in the town, she is full of hopes and

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,050
dreams and expectations...

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:58,960
Mary hoped that the ancient front tyre on
the bicycle would burst.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:09,100
Twice she had to stop to put more air in it,
which was very annoying.

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,670
For as long as she could remember, she had
been putting air in tyres, carrying firewood,

9
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,110
cleaning out the cow shed, doing a man's work.

10
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,270
Her father and two brothers worked for the
forestry company, so she and her mother had

11
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:38,900
to do everything, and there were three children
to take care of as well.

12
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,440
Theirs was a mountainy farm in Ireland, and
life was hard.

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:54,280
But this cold evening in early November she
was free.

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:07,730
She rode her bicycle along the road, thinking
pleasantly about the party.

15
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:30,049
Although she was seventeen, this was her first
party.

16
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:52,310
The invitation had come only that morning
from Mrs Rodgers, owner of 

17
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,470
the Commercial Hotel.

18
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:26,640
At first her mother did not wish Mary to go;
there was too much to be done, soup to be

19
00:03:26,640 --> 00:04:14,450
made, and one of the children had earache
and was likely to cry in the night.

20
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:46,509
But Mary begged her mother to let her go.

21
00:04:46,509 --> 00:05:12,160
'What use would it be?'

22
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:27,550
her mother said.

23
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:52,670
To her, all such excitements were bad for
you, because they gave you a taste of something

24
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,349
you couldn't have.

25
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,920
But finally she agreed.

26
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:21,319
'You can go as long as you're back in time
to milk the cows in 

27
00:06:21,319 --> 00:07:02,960
the morning, and don't do anything foolish,'
she said.

28
00:07:02,960 --> 00:08:03,930
Mary was going to stay the night in town with
Mrs Rodgers.

29
00:08:03,930 --> 00:09:06,920
She had washed and brushed her hair, which
fell in long dark waves over her shoulders.

30
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:33,650
She was allowed to wear the black evening
dress that an uncle had sent from America

31
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,950
years ago.

32
00:09:36,950 --> 00:10:42,310
Her mother said a prayer to keep her safe,
took her to the top of the farm road, warned

33
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:54,310
her never to touch alcohol, and said goodbye.

34
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:09,623
Mary felt happy as she rode along slowly,
avoiding the holes in the road, which were

35
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:10,623
covered with thin ice.

36
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:34,220
It had been very cold all day.

37
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:58,199
At the bottom of the hill she got off and
looked back, out of habit, at her house.

38
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:27,870
It was the only one on the mountain, small
and white, with a piece of land at the back

39
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,870
which they called the vegetable garden.

40
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,870
She looked away.

41
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:38,730
She was now free to think of John Roland.

42
00:12:38,730 --> 00:13:18,240
He had appeared two years before, riding a
motorbike daringly fast, and stopped to ask

43
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
the way.

44
00:13:19,240 --> 00:14:05,800
He was staying at the Commercial Hotel and
had come up to see the lake, which was famous

45
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:27,899
for the way it changed colour at different
times of day.

46
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:45,460
When the sun went down, the water was often
a strange reddish-purple, like wine.

47
00:14:45,460 --> 00:15:09,820
'Down there,' she said to the stranger, pointing
to the lake below.

48
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:57,970
Rocky hills and tiny fields of bare earth
dropped steeply towards the water.

49
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:38,310
It was midsummer and very hot; the grass was
tall and there were wild flowers, blood-red,

50
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:51,029
close to their feet.

51
00:16:51,029 --> 00:17:29,240
'What an unusual sight,' he said, looking
at the lake.

52
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:57,920
She had no interest in views herself.

53
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:55,840
She just looked up at the high sky and saw
that a bird had stopped in the air above them.

54
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:08,670
It was like a pause in her life, the bird
above them, perfectly still.

55
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:16,780
Then her mother came out to see who the stranger
was.

56
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:24,820
He introduced himself, very politely, as John
Roland, an English painter.

57
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,860
She did not remember exactly how it happened,
but after a while he walked into their kitchen

58
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:41,910
with them and sat down to tea.

59
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:49,260
Two long years had passed since that day,
but she had never stopped hoping.

60
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,929
Perhaps this evening she would see him.

61
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:58,710
The postman had said someone special in the
hotel expected her.

62
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:23,200
It 

63
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,870
seemed to her that her happiness somehow lit
up the greyness of the cold sky, the icy fields

64
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,820
going blue in the night, the dark windows
of the small houses she passed.

65
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:53,440
Suddenly her parents were rich and cheerful,
her little sister had no earache, the kitchen

66
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
fire did not smoke.

67
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,840
Sometimes she smiled at the thought of how
she would appear to him - taller and more

68
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
womanly now, in a dress that could be worn
anywhere.

69
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
She forgot about the ancient tyre, jumped
on the bicycle and rode on.

70
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
The five street lights were on when she entered
the small town.

71
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
There had been a cattle market that day, and
drunken farmers with sticks were still trying

72
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
to find their own cattle in dark corners of
the main street.

73
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
As she reached the Commercial Hotel, Mary
heard loud conversation inside, and men singing

74
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
in the bar.

75
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,330
She didn't want to go in through the front
door, in case someone saw her and told her

76
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,559
father she'd gone into the public bar.

77
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,200
So she went to the back door.

78
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
It was open, but she knocked before entering.

79
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,030
Two girls rushed to the door.

80
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
One was Doris O'Beirne.

81
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:28,860
She was famous for being the only Doris in
the whole town, and for the fact that one

82
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:39,610
of her eyes was blue and the other dark brown.

83
00:21:39,610 --> 00:22:23,669
'God, I thought it was someone important,'
she said when she saw Mary standing there,

84
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:49,380
blushing, pretty, and with a bottle of cream
in her hand.

85
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
Another girl!

86
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,270
There were far too many girls in the town.

87
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:16,830
Girls like Mary with matching eyes and long
wavy hair.

88
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:36,190
'Come in, or stay out,' said Eithne Duggan,
the second girl, to Mary.

89
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,980
It was supposed to be a joke but neither of
the town girls liked Mary.

90
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
They hated shy mountainy people.

91
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:58,330
Mary came in, carrying the cream, which her
mother had sent to Mrs Rodgers as a present.

92
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:07,730
She put it on the table and took off her coat.

93
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:18,980
The girls whispered to each other and giggled
when they saw her dress.

94
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,809
The kitchen smelt of cattle and fried food.

95
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:24,283
Mrs Rodgers came in from the bar to speak
to her.

96
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,283
'Mary, I'm glad you came, these two girls
are no use at all, always giggling.

97
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:42,868
Now the first thing to do is to move the heavy
furniture out of the sitting room upstairs,

98
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:43,868
but not the piano.

99
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:44,868
We're going to have dancing and everything.'

100
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:56,100
Quickly Mary realized she was being given
work to do, and she blushed with shock and

101
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
disappointment.

102
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:10,140
She thought of her good black dress and how
her mother wouldn't even let her wear it to

103
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,350
church on Sundays.

104
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,520
She might tear it or dirty it.

105
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:33,640
'And then we have to start cooking the goose,'
Mrs Rodgers said, and went on to explain that

106
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,049
the party was for Mr Brogan, the local Customs
Officer, who was leaving his job.

107
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,120
'There's someone here expecting me,' Mary
said, trembling with the pleasure of being

108
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:47,760
about to hear his name spoken by someone else.

109
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,700
She wondered which room was his, and if he
was likely to be in at that moment.

110
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Already in her imagination she was knocking
on his door, and could hear him inside.

111
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
'Expecting you!'

112
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Mrs Rodgers said, looking puzzled for a moment.

113
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
'Oh, that young man from the factory was asking
about you - he said he saw you at a dance

114
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
once.

115
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
A strange one, he is.'

116
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
'What man?'

117
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,350
Mary said, as she felt the happiness leaking
out of her heart.

118
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,820
But Mrs Rodgers heard the men in the bar shouting
for her to refill their empty glasses, and

119
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:18,440
she hurried out without replying.

120
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:26,370
Upstairs Doris and Eithne helped Mary move
the heavy furniture out of the sitting room.

121
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,715
The two town girls shared jokes with each
other, giggled at Mary behind her back, and

122
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:30,715
ordered her around like a servant.

123
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,715
She dusted the piano and cleaned the floor.

124
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,715
She'd come for a party!

125
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:33,715
She wished she were at home - at least with
cattle and chickens it was clean dirt.

126
00:26:33,715 --> 00:26:34,715
Then Eithne and Doris told Mary to get the
glasses ready, and they went away to drink

127
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:35,840
a secret bottle of beer in the bathroom.

128
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
'She's crying like a baby in there,' Eithne
told Doris, giggling.

129
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
'God, she looks an eejit in that dress,' Doris
said.

130
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
'It's her mother's,' Eithne said.

131
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
'What's she crying about?'

132
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
wondered Doris.

133
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
'She thought some boy would be here.

134
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Do you remember that boy who stayed here the
summer before last, with a motorbike?'

135
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
'The boy with the big nose?' said Doris.

136
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
'God, she'd frighten him in that dress.

137
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Her hair isn't natural, either.'

138
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
'I hate that kind of long black hair,' Eithne
said, drinking the last of the beer.

139
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
They hid the bottle under the bath.

140
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
In the room with the piano Mary got the glasses
ready.

141
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Tears ran down her face, so she did not put
on the light.

142
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
She saw what the party would be like.

143
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
They would eat the goose, the men would get
drunk and the girls would giggle.

144
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
They would dance and sing and tell ghost stories,
and in the morning she would have to get up

145
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
early and be home in time for milking.

146
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
She looked out of the small window at the
dirty street, remembering how once she had

147
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
danced with John on the farm road to no music
at all, just their hearts beating, and the

148
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
sound of happiness.

149
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
On that first day at tea, her father had suggested
that John should stay with them, and he stayed

150
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
for four days, helping with the farm work
and the farm machinery.

151
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
Mary made his bed in the morning and carried
up a bowl of rainwater every evening, so that

152
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
he could wash.

153
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
She washed his shirt, and that day his bare
back burnt in the sun.

154
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
She put milk on it.

155
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
It was his last day with them.

156
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
After supper he gave each of the older children
a ride on the motorbike.

157
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
She would never forget that ride.

158
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
She felt warm from head to foot in wonder
and delight.

159
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
The sun went down, and wild flowers shone
yellow in the grass.

160
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
They did not talk as they rode; she had her
arms round his stomach, with the delicate

161
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
and desperate hold of a girl in love.

162
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
However far they went, they always seemed
to be riding into a golden mist.

163
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
The lake was at its most beautiful.

164
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
They stopped at the bridge and sat on a low
stone wall.

165
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
She took an insect off his neck and touched
the skin where there was a tiny drop of blood.

166
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
It was then that they danced, to the sound
of singing birds and running water.

167
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
The air was sweet with the smell of the grass
in the fields, lying green and ungathered.

168
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
They danced.

169
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
'Sweet Mary,' he said, looking seriously into
her brown eyes.

170
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
'I cannot love you because I already have
a wife and children to love.

171
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Anyway, you are too young and too innocent.'

172
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Next day, as he was leaving, he asked if he
could send her something in the post.

173
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
It came eleven days later - a black-and-white
drawing of her, very like her, except that

174
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
the girl in the drawing was uglier.

175
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
'That's no good for anything!' said her mother,
who had been expecting a gold bracelet or

176
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
necklace.

177
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
They hung it on the kitchen wall for a while
and then one day it fell down.

178
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
Someone (probably her mother) used it, with
a brush, for collecting dirt from the floor.

179
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Mary had wanted to keep it, to put it safely
away in a drawer, but she was ashamed to.

180
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Her family were hard people, and it was only
when someone died that they ever cried or

181
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
showed much feeling.

182
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
'Sweet Mary,' he had said.

183
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
He never wrote.

184
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Two summers passed.

185
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
She had a feeling that he would come back,
and at the same time a terrible fear that

186
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
he might not.

187
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
In the upstairs room of the hotel the men
were taking off their jackets and sitting

188
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
down to eat.

189
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
The girls had carried the goose up from the
kitchen, and it lay in the center of the table.

190
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Mrs Rodgers had closed the public bar, and
now she was cutting meat off the goose and

191
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
putting it onto plates.

192
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
She kept Mary busy, serving the potatoes and
passing the food around.

193
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Mr Brogan, as chief guest, was served first,
with the best cuts of goose.

194
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Mary was surprised that people in towns seemed
so coarse.

195
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
When one of the men, Hickey, tried to take
her hand, she did not smile at all.

196
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
She wished she were at home.

197
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
She knew what her family were doing there
- the boys learning their lessons, her mother

198
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
baking bread, her father rolling cigarettes
and talking to himself.

199
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
In another hour they'd say their prayers and
go up to bed.

200
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
The routine of their lives never changed.

201
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
The fresh bread was always cool by morning.

202
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
O'Toole, the young man who worked at the factory,
had bright green eyes and hair so blond it

203
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
was almost white.

204
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
'No one's offered me any food yet,' he said.

205
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
'A nice way to behave.'

206
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
'Oh God, Mary, haven't you given Mr O'Toole
anything to eat yet?'

207
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Mrs Rodgers said, and she gave Mary a push
to hurry her up.

208
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Mary gave him a large plateful, and he thanked
her, saying they'd dance later.

209
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
To him she was far prettier than those good-for-nothing
town girls - she was tall and thin like himself.

210
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
And he liked a simple-minded girl with long
hair.

211
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
Maybe later on he'd persuade her to go into
another room, and they'd have sex.

212
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
She had lovely eyes when you looked into them,
brown and deep.

213
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
The fifth woman at the party was Crystal,
the local hairdresser, who had bright red

214
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
hair, and who did not like the undercooked
goose.

215
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
She and Mrs Rodgers were talking together
when Brogan unexpectedly began to sing.

216
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
'Let the man sing, can't you,' O'Toole said
to Doris and Eithne, who were giggling over

217
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
a private joke.

218
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Mary felt cold in her thin dress.

219
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
There hadn't been a fire in that room for
years, and the air had not warmed up yet.

220
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
'Would any of the ladies care to sing?' asked
O'Toole, when Brogan finished.

221
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
'I'm sure you can sing,' he said to Mary.

222
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
'Where she comes from, they can only just
talk,' Doris said.

223
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Mary blushed.

224
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
She said nothing, but she felt angry.

225
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Her family ate with a knife and fork, she
thought proudly, and had a cloth on the kitchen

226
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
table, not a plastic one like this, and kept
a tin of coffee in the cupboard in case strangers

227
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
came to the door.

228
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
'Christ, boys, we forgot the soup!'

229
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Mrs Rodgers said suddenly, and hurried out
with Doris to fetch it from the kitchen.

230
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
After the soup, O'Toole poured out four glasses
of whiskey, making sure that the level in

231
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
each glass was the same.

232
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
There were bottles of beer as well.

233
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
The ladies had gin and orange.

234
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
'Orange for me,' said Mary, but when her back
was turned, O'Toole put gin in her orange.

235
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
They all raised their glasses and drank to
Brogan's future.

236
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Long John Salmon, the fourth man at the party,
asked Brogan about his plans, and Brogan began

237
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
to talk about the things he wanted to do to
his house and garden.

238
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
'Come on, someone, tell us a joke,' said Hickey
after a while.

239
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
He was bored with gardening talk.

240
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
'I'll tell you a joke,' said Long John Salmon.

241
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
'Is it a funny joke?'

242
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Brogan asked.

243
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
'It's about my brother Patrick,' Long John
Salmon said.

244
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
'Not that old thing again,' said Hickey and
O'Toole, together.

245
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
'Oh, let him tell it,' said Mrs Rodgers, who
had never heard it.

246
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Long John Salmon told a story about his brother,
who died, but came back a month later as a

247
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
ghost, walking through walls and around the
yard.

248
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
'Ah God, let's have a bit of music,' said
Hickey, who had heard that story nine or ten

249
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
times.

250
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
It had neither a beginning, a middle, nor
an end.

251
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
They put a record on, and O'Toole asked Mary
to dance.

252
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Brogan and Mrs Rodgers were dancing too, and
Crystal said that she'd dance if anyone asked

253
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
her.

254
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Mary felt strange - her head was going round
and round, and in her stomach there was a

255
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
nice feeling that made her want to lie back
and stretch her legs.

256
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
A new feeling that frightened her.

257
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
O'Toole danced her right out of the room and
into the cold passage beyond, where he kissed

258
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
her clumsily.

259
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Inside the room, Crystal had begun to cry,
sitting at the table with her head on her

260
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
arms.

261
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Gin and orange always made her cry.

262
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
'Hickey, there is no happiness in life,' she
cried bitterly.

263
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
'What happiness?' said Hickey, who was full
of drink.

264
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Doris and Eithne sat on either side of Long
John Salmon, talking sweetly to him.

265
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
He was a strange man, but he owned a large
fruit farm and he was still single.

266
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Brogan, breathless from dancing, was now sitting
down, with Mrs Rodgers sitting on his knees.

267
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
The record finished, and Mary ran in from
the dark passage, away from O'Toole, who followed

268
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
her in, laughing.

269
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
O'Toole was the first to cause trouble.

270
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
He became offended when Mrs Rodgers prevented
him from telling a rude joke.

271
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
'Think of the girls,' Mrs Rodgers said.

272
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
'Girls!'

273
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
O'Toole said nastily.

274
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
He picked up the bottle of cream and poured
it over the few remaining bits of goose.

275
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
'Christ, man!'

276
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Hickey said, taking the bottle of cream away.

277
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Mrs Rodgers said it was time everyone went
to bed, as the party seemed to be over.

278
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
All the guests were staying the night at the
hotel.

279
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
The four girls were going to share one room.

280
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
In the bedroom, Mary sighed.

281
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Before they could go to bed, they had to move
the heavy furniture back to the sitting room.

282
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
She could hear O'Toole shouting and singing
in another room.

283
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
There had been gin in her orange, she knew
now, because she could smell it on her breath.

284
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
She had broken her promise to her mother;
it would bring her bad luck.

285
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
'Ah girls, girls,' O'Toole said, pushing their
bedroom door open.

286
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
'Where's my lovely Mary?

287
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Come out here with me, Mary!'

288
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
'Go to bed, you're tired,' Mary said.

289
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
He caught her hand and started trying to drag
her out of the room.

290
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
She let out a cry.

291
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
'I'll throw this flowerpot at you if you don't
leave the girl alone,' Eithne called out.

292
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
'Stupid cows, the lot of you!' said O'Toole,
but he dropped Mary's hand and took a step

293
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
backwards.

294
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
The girls rushed to shut the door and push
a heavy chest against it, to keep him out.

295
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
They all got into the one big bed, two at
the top and two at the bottom.

296
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Mary was glad to have the other girls with
her.

297
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
'I was at a party.

298
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Now I know what parties are like,' she said
to herself, as she tried to force herself

299
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
to sleep.

300
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
She heard a sound of water running, but it
did not seem to be raining outside.

301
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
At sunrise she woke up.

302
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
She had to get home in time for milking, so
she put on her dress and shoes and went downstairs.

303
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
There was a strong smell of beer.

304
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Someone, probably O'Toole, had turned on the
taps in the bar, and beer had flowed out of

305
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
the bar and into the kitchen.

306
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
Mrs Rodgers would kill somebody.

307
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Mary picked her way carefully across the room
to the door.

308
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
She left without even making a cup of tea.

309
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
She found her bicycle, but the front tyre
was flat, so she walked rapidly, pushing the

310
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,840
bicycle.

311
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
The frost lay on the sleeping windows and
roofs.

312
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,840
It had magically made the dirty streets look
white and clean.

313
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
She did not feel tired, but simply pleased
to be outside, as she breathed in the beauty

314
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
of the morning.

315
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Mrs Rodgers woke at eight and got out of Brogan's
warm bed.

316
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
She smelt disaster instantly, and ran to call
the others.

317
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
The girls were made to get up and help clean
the floors.

318
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Hickey, who had by then come downstairs, said
what a shame it was to waste good drink.

319
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
O'Toole, the guilty one, had left early.

320
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
'And where's the girl in the black dress?'

321
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
Hickey asked.

322
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
'She ran off, before we were up,' Doris said.

323
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
They all agreed that Mary was useless and
should never have been asked.

324
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
'And she was the one who encouraged O'Toole,
and then disappointed him, so he got angry,'

325
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
added Doris.

326
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
'I suppose she's home by now,' Hickey said.

327
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Mary was half a mile from home, sitting on
the grass.

328
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
If only I had a boy, someone to love, something
to hold onto, she thought, as she broke some

329
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,840
ice with her shoe and watched the crazy pattern
it made.

330
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
The poor birds could get no food, as the ground
was frozen hard.

331
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
There was frost all over Ireland, frost on
the stony fields, and on all the ugliness

332
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
of the world.

333
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Walking again, she wondered if and what she
would tell her mother and her brothers, and

334
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
if all parties were as bad.

335
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
She was at the top of the hill now, and could
see her own house, like a little white box

336
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
at the end of the world, waiting to receive
her.

337
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:04,842
- THE END -
