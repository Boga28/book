00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,690
CHAPTER ONE
Uncle Ralph

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:12,769
'I can understand a broken neck or a broken
leg, but not a broken heart.'

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:19,029
Mr Ralph Nickleby closed the thick book that
contained the names of all the people who

4
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,900
owed him money.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,550
His money-lending business was doing well,
he thought with a satisfied smile.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,489
Life had never been better.

7
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,790
It was true that he had never married, he
had no friends and he was unpopular with his

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,260
neighbours, but he did not care.

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,810
People admired him because he was rich, and
that was good enough for him.

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,200
In his world, money was the only thing that
mattered.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,190
While Mr Nickleby was congratulating himself
on his own success, there was a knock at the

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,190
door.

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,850
A tall, middle-aged man with strange, wild
eyes walked into the room.

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,840
It was Newman Noggs, Mr Nickleby's clerk.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,060
'What do you want, Newman?'

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,560
Mr Nickleby said, annoyed by his interruption.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,150
'I have a letter for you,' the clerk replied,
one eye looking at his employer, the other

18
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,590
looking out of the window.

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,670
'Well, bring it here, man!'

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,280
Mr Nickleby said impatiently.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,329
Newman took the letter carefully out of his
badly fitting suit, carried it slowly across

22
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,520
the room and gave it to his employer.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,189
Mr Nickleby read it quickly.

24
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,310
'My brother's dead,' he said.

25
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,159
'That was sudden.'

26
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,289
He stood up, walked across to the window,
and stared thoughtfully through its dirty

27
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:52,869
glass into the smoke-blackened yard behind
his house.

28
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,270
'Children alive?'

29
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,579
Noggs asked.

30
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,819
'Unfortunately for me, yes,' Mr Nickleby said.

31
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,229
'Both of them.

32
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,880
And the mother, too.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,530
No money, and now they expect me to take care
of them.

34
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,480
They're all in London now, waiting for my
help.

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,390
What do I care about them?

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,560
I never met them.'

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,640
Noggs looked at his employer's back with a
strange expression on his face.

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,360
It was not exactly a smile, but it was not
a look of sadness either.

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,450
Nobody could ever understand the expressions
on Newman Noggs's face.

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,350
'Get me my coat and gloves, Newman,' Mr Nickleby
suddenly decided, turning away from the window.

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,230
'I have a visit to make.'

42
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,120
Mr Nickleby walked quickly to the Strand,
one of the busiest streets in London.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,410
He knocked several times on the door of a
small house and waited.

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,430
The door was finally opened by a servant girl.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,390
'Is Mrs Nickleby at home?' he demanded.

46
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,790
'You mean Miss La Creevy?'

47
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,060
the girl replied.

48
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,140
'No, I mean Mrs Nickleby!'

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,530
'Show the gentleman up, Hannah,' a voice called
from inside the house.

50
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,600
Mr Nickleby walked straight past the servant
girl into the hall of the house and quickly

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,730
up the stairs.

52
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,730
On the first floor he met a small, bird-like,
middle- aged woman wearing black gloves and

53
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,670
a yellow cloth tied around her head.

54
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:39,020
'My name's Miss La Creevy,' the woman said
with a friendly smile.

55
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,610
'I'm an artist.

56
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,021
Would you like me to paint your picture for
you?

57
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,400
You have a wonderfully serious face.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,010
Such strong eyes!'

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,790
'I'm not here for a painting, madam,' Mr Nickleby
replied impatiently.

60
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,540
'I'm looking for a Mrs Nickleby.

61
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,920
Is she here?'

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,540
'A lady from the country and her two children
have rented a room on the second floor,' the

63
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,150
woman said.

64
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,950
'She's a widow.'

65
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,660
'A poor widow?'

66
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,550
'I'm afraid so.'

67
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,290
'That's her,' Mr Nickleby sighed.

68
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,970
The servant girl led him upstairs and into
a small room.

69
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,590
When he entered, a woman wearing a long black
dress rose from her chair.

70
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,350
A beautiful girl of about seventeen moved
across the room to take her arm.

71
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,790
A young man, two or three years older than
his sister, stepped forwards and greeted Ralph

72
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,160
as his uncle.

73
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
'You are Nicholas, I suppose?'

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ralph said.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,500
'That is my name, sir,' the young man smiled.

76
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,880
Ralph did not return his nephew's smile, but
turned immediately to Mrs Nickleby.

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,680
'Well, madam, how are you?' he said.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,120
'You must be brave in your sadness.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,190
I always am.'

80
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:11,000
'This is no ordinary sadness,' Mrs Nickleby
said, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,290
'I disagree,' Ralph said, calmly unbuttoning
his coat.

82
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,300
'Husbands die every day, ma'am, and wives,
too.'

83
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,700
'And brothers also, sir,' Nicholas said, already
beginning to dislike his uncle.

84
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,840
'Yes, sir, and dogs and cats,' Ralph replied,
sitting down.

85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,910
'You didn't say in your letter how my brother
died, ma'am.'

86
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,810
'Nobody knows,' Mrs Nickleby said, her eyes
filled with tears.

87
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,200
'We believe that he died of a broken heart.'

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,830
'Impossible!'

89
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,990
Ralph said angrily.

90
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,949
'I can understand a broken neck or a broken
leg, but not a broken heart.

91
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,020
It is an excuse for people who want to escape
their debts.'

92
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:12,650
'Some people, I believe, have no hearts to
break,' said Nicholas quietly.

93
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,020
Ralph turned round in his chair and looked
at his nephew with scorn.

94
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,030
'How old is this boy?' he demanded.

95
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,200
'Nicholas is nearly nineteen,' said the widow.

96
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,760
'Nineteen, eh?' said Ralph.

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,980
'And do you have a job?'

98
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,530
'Not yet,' Nicholas answered proudly, 'but
I'll find one.'

99
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,530
'You'd better,' Ralph said, staring at him
with cold, grey eyes.

100
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,680
'You haven't got a penny in the world, have
you?'

101
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,210
'That's true,' Nicholas said.

102
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,900
'But don't worry.

103
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,940
I won't need your help.'

104
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,680
Nicholas's mother begged the emotional young
man to control himself and asked Ralph to

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
forgive her son for his rudeness.

106
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,860
Ralph gave Nicholas another scornful smile,
then turned to Mrs Nickleby again.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,130
'You say in your letter, ma'am, that my brother
left you nothing when he died,' he said.

108
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,590
'That's true,' the widow said.

109
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,350
'I've had to sell our home to pay my husband's
debts, and I've spent the last of my money

110
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,830
on the journey to London.

111
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,110
'I hoped that you would be able to help your
brother's children.

112
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,250
That was his dying wish.'

113
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,919
'What can your daughter do, ma'am?'

114
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,919
Ralph asked.

115
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,050
'She has learnt a little French and music.'

116
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,360
'And have you ever done anything?'

117
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,290
Ralph said to Nicholas.

118
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,210
'No,' Nicholas replied.

119
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,229
'I thought not!'

120
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,139
Ralph said, looking again at Mrs Nickleby.

121
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,910
'Your husband was a dreamer, ma'am.

122
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,919
That's why he left you with no money, and
left me with the problem of helping you.

123
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,669
He was a foolish, selfish man.'

124
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,830
'Yes, that's true, I suppose,' Mrs Nickleby
agreed.

125
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,080
'He never listened to my advice about money.

126
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,790
I often think that I made a bad mistake when
I married him...'

127
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,389
Ralph listened to Mrs Nickleby's complaints
about her husband with a halfsmile.

128
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,750
When she had finished, he looked at his nephew
and said, 'Are you willing to work, sir?'

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,430
'Of course I am.'

130
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,250
'Then I have something here that may interest
you.'

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,230
He took a newspaper from his pocket, and showed
him an advertisement:

132
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:43,070
Mr Wackford Squeers's School for Boys, Dotheboys
Hall, near Greta Bridge in Yorkshire, needs

133
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,720
an assistant.

134
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,900
He will be paid five pounds a year.

135
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,370
Mr Squeers is staying in London, at the Saracens
Head Hotel, Snow Hill.

136
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,980
'Five pounds a year isn't much,' Kate complained.

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,340
And Yorkshire is so far away!'

138
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,450
'Be quiet, dear,' Mrs Nickleby told her.

139
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,450
'I'm sure your uncle knows best.'

140
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:13,800
'And if I get this job,' Nicholas wanted to
know, 'what will happen to my mother and sister?'

141
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,790
'I will take care of them,' Ralph promised.

142
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,990
'I will find your sister a job with a dressmaker
that I know.

143
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,680
But only if you take this job.

144
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,610
Do you understand?'

145
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,200
'Then I agree,' Nicholas said, forgetting
his anger of minutes earlier and shaking his

146
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,440
uncle's hand.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,590
'I'll take the job - if Mr Squeers will have
me.'

148
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,580
He will accept you - I can promise you that,'
Ralph said.

149
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,800
Now, get your hat and coat, young man.

150
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:56,460
We must go to the Saracen's Head immediately!'

151
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,500
CHAPTER TWO
Dotheboys Hall

152
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,670
Nicholas's heart was filled with pity for
these poor children,who suffered such cruel

153
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,649
treatment.

154
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,279
Wackford Squeers was a strange-looking man
with flat, oily hair.

155
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,170
His black jacket was much too big for him,
and his trousers were much too short.

156
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,150
But the strangest thing about him was his
face.

157
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,070
He only had one eye, which looked like a dirty
window.

158
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,000
When he smiled, it seemed to shine with a
frightening green light.

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,041
At first, Mr Squeers was unwilling to accept
Nicholas as his assistant because he was too

160
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,330
young and had not been to college.

161
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,279
But after a few quiet words with the boy's
uncle, he offered Nicholas the job.

162
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,270
'The coach leaves at eight o'clock tomorrow
morning,' he said.

163
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,399
'You mustn't be late.'

164
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,310
Nicholas woke up at six o'clock the next morning
and hurried to the Saracen's Head.

165
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,120
While he was helping Mr Squeers to lift a
few small, frightened-looking boys onto the

166
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,899
coach, he was surprised to see his mother
and sister.

167
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,550
His uncle had brought them to say goodbye.

168
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,279
'Why didn't you wake us?'

169
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,610
Mrs Nickleby said, throwing her arms around
her son.

170
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,150
'You left without breakfast!'

171
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,470
'There's no time for this, Nickleby!'

172
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,620
Squeers interrupted rudely, buttoning his
coat against the cold.

173
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,640
'Get onto the coach immediately.

174
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,410
One of my boys has already nearly fallen off.

175
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,410
If a boy died now, I'd lose twenty pounds!'

176
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,120
'Dear Nicholas,' whispered Kate, leading her
brother away.

177
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,890
'What kind of place are you going to?'

178
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,890
'I don't know, Kate,' Nicholas replied, pressing
his sister's hand.

179
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,670
'I suppose the people in Yorkshire are rougher
than people in London.'

180
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,460
'He's a nasty little man.

181
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,400
He's so rude.'

182
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,589
'But he's my employer,' Nicholas reminded
her.

183
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,320
Nicholas kissed his tearful sister and mother
and shook his uncle's hand.

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,940
Then he jumped up into his seat on the coach.

185
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,070
However, as he was waving goodbye, an odd
thing happened.

186
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,550
Somebody started pulling softly at his leg.

187
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:34,190
He looked down and saw a tall, thin man with
strange, wild eyes.

188
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,390
'What's this?'

189
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,930
Nicholas asked, when the man pushed a dirty
letter into his hand.

190
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,779
'You don't know me,' the man whispered nervously,
'but I work for your uncle.

191
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,380
Take it and read it.'

192
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,350
Before Nicholas could say another word, the
man had gone.

193
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,709
The journey to Yorkshire was long and uncomfortable.

194
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,350
It snowed heavily on the way, and everybody
felt cold and hungry.

195
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:10,480
At six o'clock the next evening, they finally
arrived at Greta Bridge.

196
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,860
Mr Squeers and Nicholas took the boys off
the coach and put them into a small cart.

197
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,220
'Is it much further to Dotheboys Hall, sir?'

198
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,080
Nicholas asked Squeers when the cart had left
Greta Bridge.

199
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,880
'About three miles,' Squeers replied.

200
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,970
'But we don't call it a "Hall" up here - only
in London, because it sounds better.'

201
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,390
Squeers laughed to himself, and Nicholas stared
into the darkness until they reached Dotheboys

202
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,500
Hall.

203
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,290
Then he understood.

204
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:52,790
The 'Hall' was just a long, low, cold-looking
house with a few old farm buildings behind

205
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,790
it.

206
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,899
While Nicholas sat in the cart with the boys,
Squeers jumped down and shouted for someone

207
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:02,399
to open the gate.

208
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,440
Several minutes later, a tall boy in old,
thin clothes ran out of the house.

209
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,180
'Why did you take so long, Smike?'

210
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,240
Squeers shouted.

211
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,950
'Sorry, sir, but I fell asleep by the fire.'

212
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,950
'Fire?

213
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,700
What fire?'

214
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,370
the schoolmaster demanded angrily.

215
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,060
'Mrs Squeers said that I could sit by the
fire in the kitchen to keep warm.'

216
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,270
'Mrs Squeers is a fool,' Squeers replied.

217
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,500
'You'd stay awake better in the cold!'

218
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:43,160
The boy called Smike opened the gate, looking
nervously at Squeers.

219
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,640
A few minutes later, Nicholas was standing
outside the door with the boys and the luggage.

220
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,560
He stared up at the cold-looking house with
its dark windows and sighed.

221
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:05,010
He was a long way from his home and family,
and he had never felt so lonely.

222
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,310
Life at Dotheboys Hall was very hard.

223
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,860
There was no heating in the school, and the
boys had to wash with buckets of icy water

224
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,950
in the mornings.

225
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:20,399
They wore the same clothes every day, and
they were always hungry.

226
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:28,220
Mrs Squeers fed them a thick, horrible soup
every day which Mr Squeers called their 'medicine'.

227
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,529
It was the cheapest food that they could find.

228
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,320
The classroom was cold and dirty with broken
windows.

229
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,600
There were a couple of old, long desks for
the children, and two desks at the front of

230
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,650
the room - one for Squeers, and a smaller
one for his assistant.

231
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,950
During the lessons, the boys sat quietly,
shaking with the cold.

232
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,190
Letters from home were opened in front of
the whole class and Squeers took all their

233
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,190
money.

234
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,860
He did the same with packages of clothes.

235
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,090
If the boys complained, Squeers hit them with
a big stick.

236
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:15,340
Nicholas watched this happen with tears of
anger in his eyes, but he felt powerless to

237
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,260
do anything.

238
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:23,970
Squeers gave to his son, young Wackford, all
the clothes that he stole from the boys.

239
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,170
He, of course, was the only boy in the school
who was never cold and hungry.

240
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,490
He was also as nasty as his father.

241
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,639
His favourite activity was kicking the other
boys and making them cry.

242
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,820
If they tried to defend themselves, young
Wackford reported them to his father and they

243
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,220
were cruelly punished.

244
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,990
Nicholas's heart was filled with pity for
these poor children, who suffered such cruel

245
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,990
treatment.

246
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:00,370
All the beauty of innocence had disappeared
from their pale, thin faces.

247
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:08,050
He never heard them laughing, and there was
no hope in their dull, empty eyes.

248
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,679
He was especially sorry for the boy called
Smike.

249
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,540
He was older than the other boys - about eighteen
or nineteen years old.

250
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,110
He was tall for his age but wore children's
clothes that were much too short for him.

251
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:29,460
He did not have lessons, but was made to do
all the hard, dirty jobs around the school.

252
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,700
If he did something wrong, Mr Squeers beat
him and shouted at him.

253
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,140
Smike had been left at the school many years
earlier by parents who did not want him.

254
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,200
However, Squeers still received money for
him from somewhere.

255
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,770
He kept him at the school because he was useful.

256
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,131
One evening, Nicholas sat on his hard, wooden
bed in the crowded, unheated room that he

257
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:58,360
shared with several other boys.

258
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,630
He was thinking sadly of home when suddenly
he remembered the letter which the man with

259
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,179
wild eyes had given him.

260
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,580
He took it out of his pocket and read:

261
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,870
My dear young man, I know the world.

262
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,660
Your father did not, and you do not either.

263
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,429
If you knew the world, you would not go on
this journey.

264
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:28,900
If you ever want help in London don't be angry,
go to the Crown Hotel, in Golden Square.

265
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,240
They will give you my address.

266
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,820
You can come at night.

267
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,309
Many years ago, people were not ashamed to
know me.

268
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,990
Now things are different - but that is not
important.

269
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,080
There is no future.

270
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,590
Newman Noggs.

271
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,160
While Nicholas was putting the letter back
in his pocket, a strange thing happened to

272
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
him.

273
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,100
His eyes filled with tears.

274
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,400
The next day, Nicholas saw Smike on his knees,
trying to light a fire.

275
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Smike looked up at Nicholas with a frightened
expression.

276
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,690
'Don't be afraid, ' Nicholas said kindly.

277
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,960
'I'm not going to hurt you.

278
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,540
Are you cold?'

279
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,410
Smike covered his face with his thin, dirty
hands and started crying.

280
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:27,710
'My heart will break if I stay in this horrible
place,' he said.

281
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,440
'Before you arrived, a boy died here.

282
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,270
He was my last friend.

283
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,080
Just before he died, his face was lit up by
a lovely smile.

284
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,820
He said that he could see the faces of his
friends around his bed.

285
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,390
They had come from home and they were smiling
and talking to him.

286
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,630
What faces will smile at me when I die?

287
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,110
There's no hope for me, alive or dead.

288
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,650
No hope.'

289
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:07,850
'There's always hope,' Nicholas said gently,
resting his hand on the boy's bony shoulder.

290
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,740
Eventually, Smike stopped crying and moved
away, like a frightened animal, into the shadows.

291
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:25,480
Nicholas sighed sadly and went to bed.

292
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,120
CHAPTER THREE
Fanny Squeers

293
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,160
'When did he ask you to marry him?'

294
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,250
'Oh, he hasn't asked me yet,' Fanny said.

295
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,761
Wackford Squeers had a twenty-two-year-old
daughter, Fanny, who was short and ugly, like

296
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,070
her father.

297
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,900
One evening, she was having dinner with her
parents while they were discussing Nicholas.

298
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,770
Fanny had never met Nicholas because she was
staying with her friend Tilda when he arrived.

299
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,510
She therefore listened to her parents' conversation
with interest.

300
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,940
When she heard her father say that he was
the 'son of a gentleman', she became very

301
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,350
interested!

302
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,070
Later that night, she asked her servant about
the new teacher.

303
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:22,250
She heard that he had beautiful dark eyes,
long straight legs and a sweet smile.

304
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,600
She decided that she wanted to meet this interesting
young man as soon as possible.

305
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,260
The next day, she went into the schoolroom,
pretending that she needed a pen.

306
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,750
When she saw Nicholas, her face went red.

307
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,930
'I'm sorry,' she said.

308
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,010
'I thought my father was here.

309
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,900
Oh, how embarrassing!'

310
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,919
'Mr Squeers is out,' Nicholas explained politely.

311
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,700
'Could you lend me a pen?'

312
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,549
the young lady asked, looking shyly at her
feet.

313
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:06,310
'He does have a beautiful smile,' she thought,
giving him a secret, sideways look.

314
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:12,220
Nicholas gave her a pen, and Fanny left the
classroom.

315
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,510
Outside the door, she held the pen to her
heart.

316
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,250
'I've never seen such wonderful legs!'

317
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,510
she sighed, walking away in a dream.

318
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,049
Minutes later, she put on her hat and coat
and hurried out of the school.

319
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,880
'I have to tell Tilda about him,' she thought.

320
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,539
Fanny was jealous of Tilda Price, who was
five years younger than her.

321
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:46,130
A week earlier a farmer, John Browdie, had
asked Tilda to marry him.

322
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:52,010
'Now I can tell her that I'm going to get
married, too!'

323
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,770
Fanny thought.

324
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,360
Tilda was surprised when she heard Fanny's
news.

325
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,330
'This is wonderful!'

326
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,330
she said.

327
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,840
'When did he ask you to marry him?'

328
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,450
'Oh, he hasn't asked me yet,' Fanny said.

329
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,270
'But I know that he wants to.

330
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,690
He smiles at me in a very special way.'

331
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,680
'Oh, Fanny,' Tilda said, hugging her friend.

332
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,480
'I'm so happy for you.

333
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,799
When can I meet the lucky young man?'

334
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,480
'In two days' time, my parents are away on
business.

335
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,510
Then you and John can both come for tea.'

336
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,740
'What a lovely idea!'

337
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
Tilda said excitedly.

338
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,270
'I can't wait!'

339
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,419
Two days later, Tilda arrived early at Dotheboys
Hall.

340
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,140
'John will be here later,' she explained.

341
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,350
'He's gone home to wash and change his clothes.'

342
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,419
The two girls helped each other with their
hair and clothes, then went downstairs.

343
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:03,659
While Fanny was talking excitedly about her
'future husband', there was a knock on the

344
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:04,950
door.

345
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,270
'Come in,' Fanny called nervously.

346
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,710
'Good evening...'

347
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,240
Nicholas said, a look of surprise on his face.

348
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,460
He had expected to find Mr Squeers.

349
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,610
'Father can't be with us today,' Fanny said.

350
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:28,610
'But that only makes it better for us, doesn't
it?'

351
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,960
Nicholas thought that these words were strange,
but he paid no attention to them.

352
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,909
He greeted Tilda politely, and stood calmly
by the window.

353
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:43,360
'Don't be embarrassed,' Tilda said, smiling
at him.

354
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,690
'I don't mind what you two do in front of
me.

355
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,240
You can pretend that I'm not here!'

356
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,960
'Tilda!'

357
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,390
Fanny said, her face going red.

358
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,289
The two girls started laughing.

359
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:04,570
Nicholas thought that the girls' behaviour
was so silly that he started laughing, too.

360
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,169
Soon, the three of them were sitting happily
at the table, eating bread and butter and

361
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:11,360
drinking tea.

362
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,950
Ten minutes later, John Browdie arrived.

363
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,170
He was a big, strong man, but he was not very
good at conversation.

364
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,820
He seemed happy just to eat bread and butter.

365
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:30,320
When the plates were empty, John stared at
Nicholas and said, 'You're a lucky man to

366
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,370
have bread and butter here.'

367
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,179
'What do you mean, sir?'

368
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,770
Nicholas replied.

369
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:41,130
'The last teacher nearly died of hunger,'
John laughed.

370
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,010
'Mr Squeers doesn't like spending money!'

371
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:51,540
Nicholas went red with anger and he told Mr
Browdie to apologise for his rudeness in front

372
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,660
of Mr Squeers's daughter.

373
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,220
Tilda was angry, too.

374
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,049
'If you say another word, John,' she said,
'I'll never speak to you again!'

375
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:08,789
Then she turned to Nicholas and whispered,
'John and I will go into the kitchen.

376
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,210
We'll leave you two alone for a few minutes.'

377
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,230
'Why do you want to do that?'

378
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,730
Nicholas asked, confused.

379
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,590
'Mr Nickleby, I'm shocked!

380
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,169
Look at poor Miss Squeers.

381
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,880
She was so excited about today, and she's
dressed so prettily because of you.'

382
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,510
'Because of me?

383
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,510
Why?'

384
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,180
Tilda looked at Nicholas with a strange smile.

385
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:43,640
'Does this handsome man think that I'm more
beautiful than Fanny?'

386
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
she thought.

387
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,060
'Perhaps he doesn't want to marry her now.'

388
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,830
'Let's have a game of cards,' she said suddenly.

389
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,740
'There are only four of us, Tilda,' Fanny
said, looking at Nicholas out of the corner

390
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,309
of her eye.

391
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,380
'We'd better play with partners, hadn't we?

392
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,770
Two against two.'

393
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,400
'What do you think, Mr Nickleby?'

394
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,530
Tilda asked.

395
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,539
'I'll be happy to be your partner, Miss Price,'
Nicholas replied.

396
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,520
'Mr Browdie,' Fanny said, looking at Tilda
angrily.

397
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,659
'Will you be my partner?'

398
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:29,289
John Browdie agreed, although he could not
understand why Fanny seemed so upset.

399
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,160
'We're going to win everything,' Nicholas
said cheerfully, after he and Tilda had won

400
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,100
the first game.

401
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:45,090
'I think Tilda has already won something that
she didn't expect - haven't you, dear?'

402
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,110
Fanny said nastily.

403
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:53,950
'Only a game of cards, my dear,' Tilda replied,
pretending not to understand.

404
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,279
She was enjoying Fanny's jealousy.

405
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,100
'How boring you are tonight!'

406
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,330
Fanny said with a bitter smile.

407
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,190
'Not at all,' Tilda replied.

408
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,240
'I'm in an excellent mood.

409
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,610
I was thinking that you seemed unusually boring
tonight.'

410
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,620
'Me!'

411
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,919
Fanny cried, biting her lip and shaking jealously.

412
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,140
'And your hair's beginning to look untidy,'
Tilda said.

413
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,730
The two friends argument became worse and
worse.

414
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,200
Finally, Fanny started crying.

415
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,820
'Tilda, I hate you,' she shouted.

416
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,700
'I feel the same way about you,' Tilda said.

417
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,580
John Browdie hit the table hard with his enormous
hand.

418
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,140
'I've had enough!' he shouted.

419
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,850
'I'm going home!'

420
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,400
'Me, too,' Tilda said, standing up and putting
on her hat.

421
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,870
She hurried out of the room, followed by John
Browdie.

422
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,740
Nicholas looked at Fanny.

423
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,000
He was unsure of what to do.

424
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,750
Fanny was crying into her handkerchief, shouting
things at the closed door.

425
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,690
After a few minutes, he quietly left the room.

426
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:16,980
'In a horrible place like this, I need all
the friends I can get,' he said to himself.

427
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,160
'But instead, I only seem to make enemies.

428
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,260
What have I done?'

429
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,070
With these unhappy thoughts, he climbed into
his dirty, cold bed.

430
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:36,130
But as he lay awake, listening to the other
boys in their beds crying with cold and hunger,

431
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,990
he soon forgot his own problems.

432
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:45,080
'Why do places as terrible as this exist?'
he thought angrily.

433
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,760
'These poor children are treated worse than
animals.

434
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,470
Why do their families send them here?'

435
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,650
The next day, things became even worse.

436
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,990
When it became clear that Nicholas did not
love her, Fanny was filled with anger and

437
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,030
confusion.

438
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,100
She could not understand why a poor teacher
like him did not find her attractive.

439
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,140
In addition to this, he had embarrassed her
in front of her friend.

440
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,659
This showed that Nicholas was not grateful
to her father for giving him a job.

441
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:26,140
'Well,' she thought, 'he has an enemy instead
of a friend.

442
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,920
I'm going to make life very difficult for
him.'

443
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,030
She noticed that Smike seemed to like Nicholas
a lot.

444
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,460
He followed the young teacher everywhere,
and was happy just to be near him.

445
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Fanny complained about this to her father,
who began to treat Smike even more roughly

446
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,160
than before.

447
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,180
One January morning, Smike disappeared.

448
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,690
Squeers and his wife went out to look for
him, and eventually found him several miles

449
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,870
away by the side of the road.

450
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,460
He was covered in mud, frozen, tired and hungry.

451
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,740
They tied his hands and feet together and
brought him back to the school.

452
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,380
Then Squeers ordered everybody to go to the
schoolroom.

453
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,890
He pulled Smike into the room and threw him
onto the floor.

454
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,770
'Have you anything to say?'

455
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,990
Squeers said to Smike, lifting a stick above
his head.

456
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,310
'Please don't hit me, sir,' Smike cried.

457
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,470
Squeers laughed, and brought the stick down
hard on the boy's back.

458
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,159
Smike screamed with pain while the other boys
watched silently.

459
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,260
Squeers lifted the stick again, but a loud
voice shouted, 'Stop!'

460
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,940
'Who said that?'

461
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,179
demanded Squeers, turning round angrily.

462
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:57,029
'I did,' said Nicholas.

463
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,960
'Sit down!'

464
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,309
Squeers told him angrily.

465
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:06,530
He lifted his stick to hit Smike again, but
Nicholas moved quickly towards him.

466
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,600
'I warn you not to touch him,' he said.

467
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,490
'I've seen enough of your evil school and
your treatment of the children here.'

468
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:21,390
Without warning, Squeers screamed wildly and
hit Nicholas across the face with his stick.

469
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,960
Nicholas immediately jumped on Squeers, took
the stick from his hand and began to hit him.

470
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,620
Mrs Squeers and Fanny tried to pull Nicholas
away, but Nicholas was too strong for them

471
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,620
all.

472
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,279
He pushed them off and threw the schoolmaster
across the room.

473
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,900
Squeers hit the wall hard and sank to the
floor without moving.

474
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,039
Nicholas looked around, but he could not see
Smike.

475
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,279
After a moment's thought, he decided that
he had no choice.

476
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:55,240
He had to leave the school immediately.

477
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:02,480
He packed his bag quickly and marched out
of the front door into the snow.

478
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:09,230
After walking for a few miles, he calmed down
and thought about his situation more clearly.

479
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,080
He did not know how he was going to get to
London.

480
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,940
He only had a little money, and London was
over two hundred and fifty miles away.

481
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,890
While Nicholas was worrying about this, he
noticed a man on a horse riding towards him.

482
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,180
It was John Browdie.

483
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,350
They exchanged greetings but did not smile.

484
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,320
After a few seconds' silence, Nicholas said,
'I'm very sorry about our argument.

485
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,149
It was my fault.

486
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:42,100
Will you shake hands?'

487
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,860
John Browdie jumped down from his horse with
a big smile and shook hands.

488
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,610
Then he noticed the cuts on Nicholas's face.

489
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,610
When Nicholas told him what had happened,
he laughed and shook his hand again.

490
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,780
'You've beaten the schoolmaster?'

491
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
he said.

492
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,289
'That's the best thing I've heard for years!

493
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,600
I love you for it!'

494
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,229
But he became more serious when Nicholas told
him about his plan to walk to London.

495
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:19,869
He pulled an old purse out of his pocket and
gave Nicholas enough money for the coach journey.

496
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,690
Nicholas tried to refuse, but John Browdie
did not listen.

497
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:30,879
'Good luck, young man,' he said, when Nicholas
had finally accepted the money.

498
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:37,059
With a cheerful wave, he climbed back onto
his horse and rode away, laughing loudly.

499
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:42,810
Nicholas continued his journey, but he did
not travel far that afternoon.

500
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,980
It was nearly dark and there had been a heavy
fall of snow, so he went into an empty farmhouse

501
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,779
and fell asleep.

502
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:57,559
When he woke up the next morning, he saw a
dark shape sitting in front of him.

503
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,109
It was Smike!

504
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,329
'What are you doing here?'

505
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,999
Nicholas asked with surprise.

506
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:07,900
'I want to go with you,' the boy replied.

507
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,359
'You're the only friend I have.

508
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,559
Please take me with you.'

509
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,420
'I'm as poor and lonely as you are,' Nicholas
said.

510
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,450
'How can I help you?'

511
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,800
'Please!'

512
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,240
the boy begged.

513
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,710
'I'll be your servant.

514
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,289
I won't ask for anything.

515
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,829
I only want to be near you.'

516
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:34,440
Nicholas agreed, and Smike's face lit up with
happiness.

517
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,119
He did not know where they were going, but
he did not care.

518
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,750
He was with his friend, and away from Dotheboys
Hall.

519
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,880
That was enough to fill his heart with happiness.

520
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,059
CHAPTER FOUR
Return to London

521
00:35:55,059 --> 00:36:01,670
'Will you, sir, return that boy to the school
where he belongs?'

522
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,569
'I will not.'

523
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:10,849
Newman Noggs had lodgings at the top of a
house near Golden Square.

524
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:16,529
Arriving home from work one night, he saw
two tired, wet travellers waiting patiently

525
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:18,319
outside his door.

526
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:23,670
He invited them straight in and gave them
some hot soup and some dry clothes.

527
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,890
'I read your letter,' Nicholas explained as
the three of them sat around the fire.

528
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,579
'I got your address from the Crown Hotel,
as you suggested.

529
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:36,940
Tell me, how are my mother and sister?'

530
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,410
'Well.

531
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,609
Your uncle is letting them live in an empty
old house that belongs to him.

532
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,660
It's near the river, and it was in a terrible
condition when they first moved in.

533
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,680
It was smelly and dirty, with rats everywhere.'

534
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,729
A strange expression crossed his face when
he said this.

535
00:36:55,729 --> 00:37:01,420
Nicholas did not know whether Newman felt
amused or sickened.

536
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,279
'But your mother and sister have cleaned a
couple of rooms and made them quite comfortable,'

537
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:12,099
Newman continued, noticing the anxious look
on Nicholas's face.

538
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:15,650
And they don't have to pay any rent.'

539
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,509
Nicholas looked relieved.

540
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:22,089
'I wanted to come here before visiting them,'
he explained.

541
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:26,390
'I didn't want to cause them any unnecessary
problems.'

542
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,380
He then described his recent adventures at
Dotheboys Hall.

543
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,329
When he had finished, Newman looked at him
seriously.

544
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:40,700
'My dear young man,' he said, 'you'll never
make progress in the world if you behave like

545
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,180
that... but I'm proud of you!'

546
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,099
'Has my uncle heard about it yet?'

547
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,959
Nicholas asked.

548
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:54,710
Newman opened and shut his mouth several times,
but did not say anything.

549
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:59,460
'I must know the bad news sooner or later,'
Nicholas said.

550
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,479
'Please tell me now.'

551
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:06,839
Newman rose from his chair and took a piece
of paper from a drawer.

552
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,729
It was a copy of a letter which Ralph had
received from Fanny Squeers two days earlier.

553
00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:18,849
In it, she described how Nicholas had attacked
her father, stolen a valuable ring and run

554
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:24,200
away with Smike 'an evil, ungrateful boy'.

555
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,749
'She's lying,' Nicholas said angrily.

556
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:31,029
'I must find my uncle and tell him what really
happened.'

557
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,640
'Your uncle's out of town,' Newman replied.

558
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,569
'He won't be back for three days.

559
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:40,099
He won't answer this letter before he returns.

560
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:41,299
Don't worry.

561
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:42,900
Nobody else knows about it.'

562
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,730
'Are you sure?

563
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,640
Not even my mother and sister?

564
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,109
Then I must go and see them.'

565
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:51,789
'No, you mustn't,' Newman said.

566
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:56,329
'Speak to your uncle when he returns.'

567
00:38:56,329 --> 00:39:02,010
The next day, Nicholas found small, cheap
lodgings for himself and Smike, and immediately

568
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,650
started looking for a job.

569
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,930
He went to a small but busy job agency near
Oxford Street, in the centre of London, where

570
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:15,259
he was offered work as a French teacher for
the daughters of a local businessman.

571
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,940
Nicholas accepted the job happily.

572
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,839
As he was walking out, a girl of about eighteen
years old came in from the street.

573
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,400
He stood to one side as she shyly walked past
him.

574
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,000
She was so beautiful that he stood and watched
her for a long time.

575
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,140
He had never seen such a lovely, innocent
face, although there was something sad about

576
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,630
her soft blue eyes.

577
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:50,019
Eventually, he turned away and walked home,
unable to stop thinking about her.

578
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:55,369
Two days later, Nicholas went to visit his
uncle, who had just returned to London.

579
00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:00,249
His uncle was not at home, so he went instead
to see Miss La Creevy.

580
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:03,170
'Mr Nicholas!'

581
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,289
Miss La Creevy cried happily when she saw
him at her door.

582
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,289
Come in.

583
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,729
You must join me for breakfast.

584
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:15,009
You look so thin, and your face is so pale.'

585
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:21,380
While they were having breakfast, Miss La
Creevy asked him why he had returned to London.

586
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,059
Nicholas explained to her what had happened.

587
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,819
Then he said, 'I came here because I want
to see my uncle.

588
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:31,549
I have to persuade him that I'm not a thief.

589
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:35,140
I went to his house this morning, but he wasn't
at home.

590
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,209
I must see him before he tells my mother and
sister these lies about me.

591
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:41,509
Perhaps you can help me.'

592
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,849
'How can I do that?'

593
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,700
Miss La Creevy asked, looking worried.

594
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,569
'My mother and sister don't know that I've
returned from Yorkshire.

595
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,259
Could you show me where they live?

596
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:57,029
I want to see them before my uncle does.'

597
00:40:57,029 --> 00:41:01,910
Miss La Creevy took him straight to the house
by the river, and Nicholas was shocked when

598
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,660
he saw it.

599
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,690
It's windows were covered with mud, and its
walls were wet and dirty.

600
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,150
It had probably been empty for many years.

601
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:18,839
Miss La Creevy led him through the door, across
a dark, smelly hall and up some stairs.

602
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,410
She stopped outside a freshly painted door.

603
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,410
'This is it,' she said.

604
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,029
'Your mother and I have worked very hard to
make this as comfortable as possible.'

605
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:35,739
However, as she was going to knock on the
door, she stopped.

606
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,059
There was the sound of a man's deep voice
from inside the room.

607
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:43,890
Ralph Nickleby had arrived before them!

608
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:49,069
He was telling Mrs Nickleby and Kate about
Nicholas, and they were both crying.

609
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:51,310
'It's impossible!'

610
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,499
Kate said.

611
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:54,390
'Nicholas isn't a thief.

612
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,680
Mother, how can you sit and listen to such
things?'

613
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,059
Mrs Nickleby, who had never been very good
at understanding situations, just cried even

614
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:07,549
more loudly into her handkerchief.

615
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:11,759
'If my nephew's innocent, why is he hiding
from us?'

616
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,759
Ralph said.

617
00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:17,660
'I'm afraid you must both accept the fact
that he's a dangerous criminal.'

618
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,530
'That's a lie!'

619
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,640
an angry voice shouted, and Nicholas rushed
in.

620
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,190
Ralph turned and stared angrily at his nephew.

621
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:32,799
'Dear Nicholas,' Kate cried, throwing her
arms around her brother.

622
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:35,339
'Be calm, don't do anything foolish...'

623
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,339
'Be calm?'

624
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,609
Nicholas replied, his face red with anger.

625
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:43,249
'How can I be calm in front of this man?

626
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:47,819
He sent me to an evil place to work for the
cruellest man that I've ever known.

627
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:51,900
And now he's poisoning the ears of my family
against me...'

628
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,559
'Be patient,' Kate begged him.

629
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:55,559
'Calm down.

630
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,390
Tell us what really happened.'

631
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,680
'It's true that I attacked the schoolmaster,'
Nicholas said.

632
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,740
'But I did it to save a poor, innocent boy
from certain death.

633
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,130
I'm not sorry.

634
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,059
I'd do the same again if I had the chance.'

635
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:14,449
'Do you hear this?'

636
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:17,089
Ralph said, turning to Mrs Nickleby.

637
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:19,690
'Your son isn't even sorry!'

638
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,890
Oh dear!

639
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,119
cried Mrs Nickleby.

640
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,160
'I don't know what to think.

641
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,349
'But I'm not a thief!'

642
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,780
Nicholas continued, staring proudly at his
uncle.

643
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,920
'I found a ring in my pocket after I'd left
that horrible school.

644
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,259
It was a cheap ring.

645
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:42,670
I believe that Mrs Squeers put it there to
make me look like a thief.

646
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,859
I sent it back to the school immediately.'

647
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:48,930
'And what about the boy, Smike?'

648
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,930
Kate asked.

649
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,190
'Is it true that you ran away with him?'

650
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,410
'Yes.

651
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,619
He's the boy that I saved from the schoolmaster.

652
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:01,380
He's suffered years of cruel treatment at
that school.

653
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,309
He wanted to come with me, and he's with me
now.'

654
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,180
'So everything is true,' Ralph said.

655
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,319
'You don't deny it!

656
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:16,019
Will you, sir, return that boy to the school
where he belongs?'

657
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,900
'I will not.'

658
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,299
'You refuse?' said Ralph.

659
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:22,940
'Then you must listen to me.'

660
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
'Why?

661
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,900
I will not listen to any more of your lies.'

662
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,400
'Then I will speak to your mother.

663
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,069
She understands the real world.

664
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:40,269
Ma'am, I tried to help you by finding your
son honest work, but he is a lazy, selfish,

665
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:41,619
ungrateful boy.

666
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:46,109
I will not help him - or you, if he stays
with you.

667
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:48,749
If that boy stays, I will leave you now.

668
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:52,999
You will never see me again.'

669
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:58,849
'You've been kind to us, sir,' Mrs Nickleby
replied from behind her handkerchief 'But

670
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:05,410
I can't send my own son away, even if he is
guilty of these terrible crimes.'

671
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:08,559
'Why do you say "if", Mother?'

672
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:09,559
Kate asked.

673
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,059
'You know he's innocent.'

674
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:16,680
'I don't know what to think,' Mrs Nickleby
replied.

675
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,359
'Nicholas is sometimes very bad-tempered,
and your uncle has been so good to us.

676
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,779
But let's not talk about it anymore.

677
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:29,209
I can't send my own son away.

678
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:33,539
Even if it means that we don't have a penny
in the world...'

679
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:36,989
Ralph turned towards the door, but Nicholas
stopped him.

680
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:40,319
'You needn't leave this place, sir,' he said.

681
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,500
'I'll go, and you won't see me for a very
long time.'

682
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,849
'Nicholas!'

683
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:50,009
Kate said, throwing her arms again around
her brother.

684
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:52,170
'You can't go.

685
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,199
You'll break my heart if you do.'

686
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:57,319
'I have to,' Nicholas replied gently.

687
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:01,319
'If I stay, I'll only bring you unhappiness.

688
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,809
We won't forget each other, I promise.

689
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:07,599
And I'm sure that better days will come.'

690
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,869
He kissed his sister gently, then turned again
to his uncle.

691
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:16,789
'I leave my family to you, sir,' he whispered.

692
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:25,369
'But I promise - if anything bad happens to
them, you'll be punished.'

693
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:39,380
Nicholas left the room without another word
and, a few days later, he and Smike left London.

694
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,080
CHAPTER FIVE
Sir Mulberry Hawk

695
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,420
'Let me go immediately; sir,' Kate whispered
angrily.

696
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:56,369
'My dear girl, why do you pretend to dislike
me so much?'

697
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,999
Soon after Nicholas had left London, Kate
lost her job at the dressmaker's.

698
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:06,359
Her mother looked through the newspapers and
quickly found an interesting advertisement:

699
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:11,940
a woman called Mrs Wititterly was looking
for a companion.

700
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,269
Although Kate did not really want the job,
she was too tired and upset by recent events

701
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:19,199
to argue.

702
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,709
She went with her mother for an interview
with Mrs Wititterly.

703
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:29,569
Mrs Wititterly - a nervous, ill-looking woman
- lived in a large house near Sloane Square,

704
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:33,200
a very expensive part of London.

705
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,210
Kate's gentleness and intelligence pleased
her, and she offered Kate the job as her companion.

706
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,660
Mrs Nickleby was very excited.

707
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,940
'Mrs Wititterly looks very ill,' she thought.

708
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,999
'Perhaps she'll die soon and Mr Wititterly
- a fine-looking gentleman!

709
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,359
- will fall in love with Kate.

710
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,779
He'll ask her to marry him and all our troubles
will end!'

711
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:05,880
A week after the interview, Kate moved all
her things to Mrs Wititterly's house and started

712
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,789
work.

713
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:14,839
Ralph Nickleby had a very important business
customer, Sir Mulberry Hawk, an ugly old man

714
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,710
with lots of money, who had met Kate once
at dinner at Ralph's house.

715
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:26,390
Unfortunately for Kate, this horrible old
man had liked her a lot.

716
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:32,239
He had sat next to her at dinner and had embarrassed
her all evening with his rude jokes and horrible

717
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,109
wet-lipped smiles.

718
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:41,200
She had been so upset by his impolite behaviour
that she had left the table.

719
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,019
After dinner, Sir Mulberry had told Ralph
that he wanted to meet Kate again.

720
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:51,839
He asked Ralph to help him and Ralph agreed
immediately, thinking that this would be good

721
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,940
for his business.

722
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,079
He arranged for Sir Mulberry to meet Mrs Nickleby
at his office.

723
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,049
Mrs Nickleby liked Sir Mulberry because he
said so many nice things about her and her

724
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:06,049
daughter.

725
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:11,319
'Such a beautiful, intelligent girl!' he said.

726
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:14,109
'But I'm not surprised.

727
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:18,999
She has such a beautiful, intelligent mother.'

728
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:24,869
Mrs Nickleby smiled proudly, and let Sir Mulberry
walk home with her.

729
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,439
When he had said goodbye, she closed her eyes
with excitement.

730
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:31,890
'I don't believe it,' she thought.

731
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,499
'Such a fine gentleman!

732
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:40,190
He will be an even better husband for Kate
than Mr Wititterly!'

733
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:45,010
One evening, Sir Mulberry invited Mrs Nickleby
to the theatre with him.

734
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,700
She put on her best clothes and sat with him
in the most expensive seats.

735
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,849
Sir Mulberry was a drunk, but Mrs Nickleby
did not care.

736
00:49:55,849 --> 00:50:01,269
She felt proud to be with such a well-dressed
gentleman - especially as he was so interested

737
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:04,170
in her daughter.

738
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:10,680
He was telling her for the twentieth time
how beautiful Kate was when suddenly he stopped.

739
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,650
'Listen!' he said.

740
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,319
'Some people have come into the next seats.

741
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,170
I'm sure I recognise one of the voices.'

742
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,509
Mrs Nickleby listened, and opened her mouth
with surprise.

743
00:50:25,509 --> 00:50:30,660
She bent forwards and looked around the curtain
between the seats.

744
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,680
'Kate!'

745
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,809
she said.

746
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:36,930
'What a lovely surprise!'

747
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,930
'Mother!'

748
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,930
Kate replied, equally surprised.

749
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,089
'What are you doing here?'

750
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:46,180
Then she noticed a man sitting in the shadows
behind her mother.

751
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,259
He was smiling at Kate and kissing the back
of his hand.

752
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,259
'Who is that man with you?'

753
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,259
Kate whispered.

754
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,460
'You'll never guess!'

755
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,819
replied Mrs Nickleby loudly, so that Mrs Wititterly
could hear.

756
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:04,170
'This is Sir Mulberry Hawk.'

757
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,910
Kate remembered the horrible old man from
her uncle's dinner party, and her face went

758
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,170
pale.

759
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:17,589
However, Mrs Nickleby mistook the strange
look on her daughter's face for shyness - the

760
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:21,009
shyness of love!

761
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:27,200
Mrs Wititterly was as excited as Mrs Nickleby,
because Sir Mulberry Hawk was such an important

762
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,829
gentleman.

763
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:34,150
She told her husband to invite Sir Mulberry
and Mrs Nickleby to sit with them.

764
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,859
'Dear Kate,' said Mrs Nickleby, kissing her
daughter.

765
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:41,430
'How ill you looked a moment ago!

766
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,980
You frightened me!'

767
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,989
'It was nothing, Mother,' Kate replied, but
it was too late to explain her true feelings

768
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:51,229
to her.

769
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:57,209
She greeted Sir Mulberry politely, then turned
her head towards the stage.

770
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:01,690
Sir Mulberry sat behind her all evening, and
she could not enjoy the play.

771
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:06,940
When the play had finished, Sir Mulberry took
her arm.

772
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:12,849
Kate tried to escape and walk away, but Sir
Mulberry pulled her back.

773
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:15,420
'Don't hurry,' he said.

774
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,849
'Let me go immediately, sir,' Kate whispered
angrily.

775
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:26,890
'My dear girl, why do you pretend to dislike
me so much?'

776
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,559
'Pretend!'

777
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:29,630
Kate repeated.

778
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,119
'How impolite of you, sir, to talk to me in
this way!'

779
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:40,489
'You look prettier when you're angry,' Sir
Mulberry said, moving his face closer to hers.

780
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:44,979
'I hate you, sir,' Kate said, pulling back
from him.

781
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:47,569
'You show scorn for my feelings.

782
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:51,369
If you do not let me join my friends immediately,
you'll be sorry.

783
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,089
I can be rude, too.

784
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:57,749
I know how to embarrass a man like you in
public.'

785
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:01,680
Sir Mulberry smiled, but did not let go of
her arm.

786
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,029
When they had reached the front of the theatre,
Kate pulled away from him angrily.

787
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:11,970
She hurried past her mother and the Wititterlys
without a word.

788
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:16,640
Then she jumped into the waiting carriage,
threw herself into the darkest corner and

789
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,049
cried.

790
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:24,220
The next day, Kate received a long letter
from her mother, congratulating her on her

791
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:27,200
choice of future husband!

792
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:34,430
Kate felt more upset than ever, but she had
to try to forget her unhappiness.

793
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,979
Her job was to be cheerful with Mrs Wititterly.

794
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:44,630
That afternoon, while she was reading to her
employer, there was a knock on the door.

795
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:49,920
'That's Sir Mulberry Hawk,' Mrs Wititterly
smiled from her sofa.

796
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,089
'I gave him permission to visit.

797
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:54,259
Aren't you pleased?'

798
00:53:54,259 --> 00:54:00,289
Before Kate could answer, the door opened
and Sir Mulberry walked into the room.

799
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:04,160
He sat with the two ladies for over an hour.

800
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,759
Mr Wititterly sat with them, too, enjoying
the visit of such an important guest.

801
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:14,440
But Kate refused to be friendly.

802
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,999
Sir Mulberry seemed to find Kate's unfriendliness
attractive, and he visited the house every

803
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:22,799
day for the next two weeks.

804
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:30,499
However, as his feelings for Kate became clearer,
there was a change in Mrs Wititterly's behaviour.

805
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:36,049
Jealous of the attention that he gave to Kate,
she became less friendly towards her.

806
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:39,900
Poor Kate had never been so sad.

807
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,249
She already had to suffer Sir Mulberry Hawk's
visits every afternoon.

808
00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:49,739
Now she had to suffer Mrs Wititterly's increasing
coldness towards her, too.

809
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:56,579
Eventually, the two women had a big argument,
and Kate hurried to her uncle's house.

810
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:00,880
Ralph Nickleby was counting money in his office
when his niece arrived.

811
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,679
He quickly hid the money, put an empty purse
on his desk and told Newman Noggs to show

812
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:07,679
her in.

813
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,479
'Well, my dear, what's the matter now?' he
asked.

814
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:16,630
Her eyes shone with anger as she told him
about Sir Mulberry.

815
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,279
'He's such a rude, unpleasant man,' she said.

816
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,489
'Mother thinks that he's a gentleman, but
she's wrong.

817
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:28,809
Why did you allow him to meet me in this way?'

818
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:32,519
Something about her proud expression reminded
Ralph of Nicholas.

819
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:37,549
'There is some of that boy's blood in you,
I see,' he said.

820
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:39,369
'I hope there is!'

821
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,369
replied Kate.

822
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:42,309
'And I'm proud of it.

823
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:46,440
As I am your brother's child, I will not accept
these insults anymore.'

824
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,150
'What insults, girl?'

825
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:52,009
'That man treats me like a toy.

826
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:54,029
Uncle, you have to stop him.

827
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:56,209
I'm sure that you will help me.

828
00:55:56,209 --> 00:55:59,709
I have no one to advise me or protect me except
for you.

829
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:01,170
Please help me.'

830
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,250
'How can I help you, child?'

831
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:07,839
Ralph said, rising from his chair and walking
up and down behind his desk.

832
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,809
'Tell him to leave me alone.'

833
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:13,319
'No,' Ralph shook his head.

834
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,259
'I can't do that.'

835
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:18,650
Kate looked at him in surprise.

836
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:20,539
'He's an important customer.

837
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:22,549
I can't afford to offend him.

838
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,509
You'll have to live with it.

839
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:27,079
He'll soon get bored with you.

840
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,509
Just be patient...'

841
00:56:29,509 --> 00:56:30,509
'Patient!'

842
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:31,509
Kate cried.

843
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:35,460
'I'd rather live on the street than have to
see that man again.'

844
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:41,670
Before Ralph could say another word, she left
the room.

845
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,299
As she was closing the door behind her, she
was surprised to find Newman Noggs standing

846
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:47,410
in the hall.

847
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:50,650
'I heard everything,' he said.

848
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,209
'You're right to be strong in front of him.

849
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,229
Oh, yes!

850
00:56:54,229 --> 00:56:55,229
Ha-ha-ha!

851
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:57,769
Oh, yes, you poor thing.'

852
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:02,719
He walked slowly across the hall and opened
the door to let her out into the street.

853
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,619
'Don't be sad,' he whispered.

854
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:08,180
'I shall see you soon.

855
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,180
Ha-ha-ha.

856
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,249
And so will somebody else.

857
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:12,279
Yes, yes.'

858
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:16,549
'Thank you,' Kate answered, hurrying past
him.

859
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:19,680
'You're very kind.'

860
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,009
She walked quickly back to Mrs Wititterly's
house, trying to understand Newman's strange

861
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,640
words.

862
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,049
She did not know that Newman had received
a letter from Nicholas.

863
00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:36,719
Her brother and Smike were working for a small
theatre company in the south of England.

864
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,579
Newman knew Nicholas's address, and planned
to write to him about Kate's problems as soon

865
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:49,359
as he could.

866
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,450
CHAPTER SIX
Nicholas Fights Back

867
00:57:52,450 --> 00:58:01,519
Nicholas's anger was greater than his pain,
and he threw himself at Sir Mulberry.

868
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,799
When Nicholas received Newman's letter, he
and Smike returned to London immediately.

869
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,569
They went straight to Newman's lodgings, but
the clerk was not at home.

870
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:17,199
Nicholas left Smike to wait for him, and went
to see Miss La Creevy, who was not at home

871
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:19,029
either.

872
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:22,400
After thinking for a moment, he decided to
see his mother.

873
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,709
A servant girl told him that Mrs Nickleby
was at the theatre for the evening.

874
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:33,459
She also told him that his sister now lived
at a different address.

875
00:58:33,459 --> 00:58:38,440
Nicholas walked anxiously along the streets,
wondering what to do.

876
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,859
Feeling hungry, he stopped outside a handsome
hotel.

877
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:45,099
An expensive place,' he thought.

878
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:49,759
'But a glass of wine and a piece of cake will
not cost too much.'

879
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:53,439
He went into the hotel and entered the coffee-room.

880
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:59,929
It was empty except for a noisy group of four
gentlemen at one table.

881
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:06,140
Nicholas sat down at a table near the fire,
ordered some wine and cake, and began to read

882
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,200
a newspaper.

883
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,819
Suddenly, he heard one of the men at the other
table say his sister s name, and looked up

884
00:59:12,819 --> 00:59:15,410
from his paper with surprise.

885
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,710
'Little Kate Nickleby!'

886
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:22,270
the other three men said, lifting their glasses.

887
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:28,400
The four men drank their wine, put their empty
glasses on the table and started laughing.

888
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,789
Nicholas's face burned with anger, but he
did not move.

889
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:38,190
'She's a clever little thing,' the first man
said.

890
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:43,349
'She pretends that she doesn't like me, but
she's only playing a game.

891
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:45,160
She's like her uncle.'

892
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,869
'Perhaps her mother is jealous,' another man
said.

893
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:51,400
'She's locked her daughter up.

894
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,619
That's why you can't see her.'

895
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:56,400
'That's no problem,' the first man said.

896
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,699
'I can do anything with the old lady.

897
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,650
She'll believe anything I tell her.'

898
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,549
The four men started laughing again.

899
01:00:05,549 --> 01:00:09,799
Nicholas rose angrily and walked across to
their table.

900
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:16,210
'I'd like to speak to you, sir,' he said,
staring at the man who had spoken last.

901
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:19,359
'With me, sir?'

902
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,769
Sir Mulberry Hawk replied, looking at Nicholas
with drunken scorn.

903
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:30,269
'With you, sir, in private,' Nicholas replied
quietly.

904
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:34,439
'A mysterious stranger!'

905
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:39,719
Sir Mulberry laughed, lifting his wine-glass
to his thick, ugly lips and looking round

906
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,119
at his friends.

907
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,900
'Do you refuse to speak to me?'

908
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,900
Nicholas said.

909
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:52,709
'Tell me what you want or go away,' Sir Mulberry
answered, drinking more wine.

910
01:00:52,709 --> 01:00:57,239
Nicholas took a card from his pocket and threw
it on the table.

911
01:00:57,239 --> 01:00:59,279
'There, sir,' he said.

912
01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:03,859
'You will know what I want when you see my
name.'

913
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:09,140
Sir Mulberry read the name on the card, threw
it back onto the table and continued drinking.

914
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,779
'Your name and address, sir?'

915
01:01:12,779 --> 01:01:15,259
Nicholas said quietly, shaking with anger.

916
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:20,559
'I shall give you neither,' replied Sir Mulberry.

917
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,819
'If you are not a gentleman, sir, perhaps
one of your friends is.

918
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:30,089
Can anybody give me this man's name and address?'

919
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:32,720
There was silence around the table.

920
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,859
'I am the brother of the young lady who has
been the subject of conversation at this table,

921
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:39,859
Nicholas said.

922
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,929
'This man is a lying coward.

923
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:49,040
If no one will tell me his name or address,
I can easily discover it.'

924
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:55,989
Sir Mulberry looked at Nicholas with scorn,
then said to his friends, 'Let him talk until

925
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:57,689
midnight if he wants.

926
01:01:57,689 --> 01:02:04,700
I have nothing serious to say to a boy of
his low class.

927
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:11,339
The four men continued laughing and drinking,
so Nicholas returned to his table and waited.

928
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:18,250
Eventually, three of the men went home, leaving
Sir Mulberry alone in the room with Nicholas.

929
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:24,440
Sir Mulberry sat in silence, staring at the
wall with drunken, empty eyes.

930
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,579
Nicholas watched and waited, but said nothing.

931
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:34,559
At last, Sir Mulberry gave Nicholas another
long, scornful look and rose slowly to his

932
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,559
feet.

933
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:39,999
With the waiter's help, he put on his gloves,
hat and coat.

934
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:42,589
Then he walked outside.

935
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:45,299
Nicholas followed him into the street.

936
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:49,640
'Will you tell me who you are?' he said again.

937
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
'No.'

938
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,410
'I shall hold on to your carriage if you don't
tell me.'

939
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,569
'I shall tell my driver to hit you if you
do.'

940
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:00,699
'You're an evil man.'

941
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:02,089
'And what are you?'

942
01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:07,029
'I'm the son of a country gentleman,' Nicholas
replied.

943
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:11,999
'I'm the same as you in birth and background,
and better than you in everything else.

944
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:16,210
I tell you again, Miss Nickleby is my sister.

945
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,849
Will you or will you not tell me who you are?'

946
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:25,319
'I'd tell a real gentleman, but not a boy
like you.

947
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,569
Get out of my way, dog!'

948
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:33,509
Sir Mulberry pushed him to one side and got
into his carriage.

949
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,209
Nicholas jumped forward and put his hands
on the door.

950
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:40,529
'I will not let you leave until you...'

951
01:03:40,529 --> 01:03:45,559
Before he could finish his sentence, Sir Mulberry
lifted his stick and hit him hard on the side

952
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,539
of the head.

953
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:52,859
Nicholas's anger was greater than his pain,
and he threw himself at Sir Mulberry.

954
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:57,359
In the fight that followed, he managed to
take hold of the stick and hit Sir Mulberry

955
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,799
across the face with its heavy handle.

956
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:06,079
Sir Mulberry fell back into the carriage and
Nicholas fell to the ground.

957
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,440
Frightened by the fighting, the horse ran
off wildly down the street, pulling the carriage

958
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,160
behind it.

959
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,799
Nicholas felt sick, but he rose painfully
to his feet.

960
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:22,839
There was loud shouting all around him as
the driver and other men ran after the carriage.

961
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:29,099
As soon as the carriage disappeared around
a corner, there was a loud crash, a scream

962
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,920
and the sound of breaking glass.

963
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,661
When Nicholas arrived back at the lodgings,
he found Newman Noggs sitting by the fire

964
01:04:37,661 --> 01:04:38,819
with Smike.

965
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:41,880
'What have you been doing?'

966
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,490
Newman asked when he saw Nicholas's blood-covered
face.

967
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:48,759
'Don't worry about me,' Nicholas replied.

968
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,170
'I'm not badly hurt.

969
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,079
But I want you to tell me about my sister.

970
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:55,819
I've learnt part of the story tonight.

971
01:04:55,819 --> 01:04:58,949
You must tell me the rest.'

972
01:04:58,949 --> 01:05:03,749
Newman made Nicholas take off his coat and
washed the blood from his face.

973
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:09,059
While he was doing this, he told him everything
about his uncle, Sir Mulberry Hawk and his

974
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,809
sister.

975
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:17,029
Nicholas listened in silence, then told Newman
about his fight earlier that evening.

976
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:21,349
'I'm sure that was Sir Mulberry,' Newman said.

977
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:26,890
Tomorrow morning, we must find another place
for my mother to live,' Nicholas replied.

978
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,599
Could you send Miss La Creevy to tell her?

979
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,259
Please don't say anything about what happened
tonight.

980
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:37,289
I also want you to deliver a short letter
to my uncle.'

981
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:43,789
Early the next morning, Nicholas went to see
his sister at Mrs Wititterly s house.

982
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:47,249
Brother and sister immediately fell into each
other's arms.

983
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:51,729
'I've been so unhappy, dear brother,' Kate
cried.

984
01:05:51,729 --> 01:05:56,410
'Don't leave me here or I shall die of a broken
heart.'

985
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,259
'I'll never leave you anywhere again,' Nicholas
promised.

986
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:04,859
Apologising quickly to the Wititterlys, he
hurried with his sister to their mother's

987
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:07,019
house by the river.

988
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:14,729
'Miss La Creevy has told me everything,' Mrs
Nickleby sighed when they arrived.

989
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:16,819
'But I still don't understand.

990
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:20,459
Is Sir Mulberry such a bad man?

991
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:23,719
Why don't you speak to your uncle?

992
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:25,420
Perhaps there has been some mistake...?'

993
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:31,579
'My dear mother,' Nicholas replied, 'the time
for talking has gone.

994
01:06:31,579 --> 01:06:38,199
After the terrible things that he has done,
you must throw him out of your life.

995
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:41,319
We do not owe him anything except our scorn.

996
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:43,859
You must leave this house at once.

997
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:48,390
We can stay in our old place at Miss La Creevy's
until I can make other arrangements.'

998
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:53,809
'Everything is ready for you,' Miss La Creevy
said.

999
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,669
'You'll all be very welcome.'

1000
01:06:55,669 --> 01:07:04,259
'But I've just spent eighteen pence on painting
the ceiling,' Mrs Nickleby complained, and

1001
01:07:04,259 --> 01:07:06,990
started crying.

1002
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:11,799
While Miss La Creevy looked after their mother,
Nicholas and Kate carried the furniture into

1003
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:14,130
a waiting cart.

1004
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:18,630
After the three women had finally left, Nicholas
hurried to meet Newman.

1005
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:23,619
He gave him a letter for his uncle and the
key to the house.

1006
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:29,869
'When you see my mother and sister at Miss
La Creevy's, don't say anything about last

1007
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:33,160
night,' he reminded him.

1008
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,380
Newman took the letter and key, and gave them
to Ralph in his office.

1009
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,440
'What's this?'

1010
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,339
Ralph said, picking up the key.

1011
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,990
'It came with the letter.

1012
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:49,650
A boy brought them a quarter of an hour ago,'
Newman lied.

1013
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,640
Ralph opened the letter and read:

1014
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,640
I know all about you and your evil plans.

1015
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,449
Your brother's widow and her daughter refuse
any more of your help.

1016
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:03,099
They hate you as much as I do.

1017
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:09,549
I hope that on your death-bed you will feel
ashamed of yourself.

1018
01:08:09,549 --> 01:08:13,809
Ralph Nickleby read the letter twice, then
dropped it to the floor.

1019
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:19,650
He sat quietly at his desk, staring angrily
at the wall.

1020
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:32,250
He did not notice the small smile on his old
clerk's lips.

1021
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:35,219
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Change of Luck

1022
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:40,329
'But I am looking for work,' Nicholas replied.

1023
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:45,759
'What?' the old man said with surprise.

1024
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:51,449
Two days later, Ralph Nickleby learnt about
Nicholas's attack on Sir Mulberry Hawk.

1025
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:55,759
He sat in his office and wondered what to
do about the boy.

1026
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:01,359
While he was thinking, he received an unexpected
visit from Wackford Squeers.

1027
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:06,299
Squeers had come to London to find more pupils
for Dotheboys Hall, and he also wanted to

1028
01:09:06,299 --> 01:09:08,520
talk to Ralph about his nephew.

1029
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,469
The two men sat together, planning their revenge.

1030
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:18,650
Meanwhile, Mrs Nickleby and Kate were back
in their old rooms in Miss La Creevy's house,

1031
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:23,130
and Nicholas decided to introduce them to
Smike.

1032
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:28,909
Smike was shy at first, but Kate and Miss
La Creevy were very kind to him.

1033
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:33,619
They soon persuaded Mrs Nickleby, who was
unsure of him, to let him stay.

1034
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:39,799
The next day, Nicholas returned to the job
agency near Oxford Street.

1035
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:44,029
Before he went in, he looked at the advertisements
in the window.

1036
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:49,159
While he was looking, an old gentleman in
a blue coat and white hat walked towards the

1037
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:53,049
window and stood in the street next to him.

1038
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:56,539
Nicholas looked at him out of the corner of
his eye.

1039
01:09:56,539 --> 01:10:01,340
The old gentleman suddenly looked at Nicholas,
and Nicholas looked away.

1040
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:06,210
'I'm sorry,' he said, his face red with embarrassment.

1041
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,840
'I didn't mean to be rude.'

1042
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,619
'I'm not offended,' the man said with a smile.

1043
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:18,530
There was something so friendly about the
man's smile, his round face and the warm look

1044
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,730
in his eyes, that Nicholas spoke again.

1045
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:26,190
'There are a lot of jobs here, sir,' he said,
half-smiling.

1046
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,030
'There are,' the man agreed.

1047
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:33,840
'I feel so sorry for the people who have to
come here.'

1048
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,510
He began to move away, but then noticed Nicholas's
expression.

1049
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:42,199
'You wanted to say something, young man?'
he said.

1050
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:47,199
'I was wondering why you were looking at these
advertisements,' Nicholas replied.

1051
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,150
'Did you think I was looking for work?'

1052
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:52,780
Nicholas shook his head.

1053
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,780
'Ha!

1054
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,449
Ha!' laughed the old gentleman.

1055
01:10:55,449 --> 01:10:58,440
'A very natural thought, I suppose.

1056
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,409
I thought the same about you.'

1057
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:05,239
'But I am looking for work,' Nicholas replied.

1058
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:08,369
'What?' the old man said with surprise.

1059
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:12,380
'A well-behaved, polite young gentleman like
you?

1060
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,659
I don't believe it.'

1061
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:20,320
Nicholas told him about the death of his father
and the unhappy situation of his poor mother

1062
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,460
and sister.

1063
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:28,270
Before he realized it, he had told the kind
old man almost everything about his life.

1064
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:32,330
He did not, however, say much about his uncle.

1065
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,639
The old man listened with great attention.

1066
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:40,320
When Nicholas had finished his story, he said,
'Come along with me.

1067
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,050
We mustn't lose a minute.'

1068
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:49,110
The old gentleman took Nicholas across London
to a quiet square in East London, near the

1069
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:55,650
Bank of England, and led him into the oldest,
cleanest-looking house in the square.

1070
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,679
The name Cheeryble Brothers was above the
door.

1071
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:05,010
Nicholas followed the old gentleman across
a large, busy hall that was filled with boxes

1072
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,159
of cotton and other material.

1073
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:11,150
They went across a yard and into another building.

1074
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:18,300
Inside this building, which was the counting-house,
an old, large-faced man with silver glasses

1075
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,670
was sitting at a desk.

1076
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:24,940
'Is my brother in his room, Tim?' asked the
old gentleman.

1077
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:31,110
'Yes, he is, Mr Cheeryble,' replied the old
clerk, looking at Nicholas over the top of

1078
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,329
his glasses.

1079
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:37,260
Mr Cheeryble led Nicholas into another office.

1080
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:42,920
Nicholas couldn't believe his eyes when he
saw Mr Cheeryble's brother - the two gentlemen

1081
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,880
looked exactly the same!

1082
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,020
'Brother Ned, I'd like you to meet a young
friend of mine who needs our help.'

1083
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,570
'What does he need, Brother Charles?'

1084
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:59,070
the other man asked, looking at Nicholas with
a kind smile.

1085
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:05,239
Charles told his brother the details of Nicholas's
situation and, after a long conversation,

1086
01:13:05,239 --> 01:13:10,489
Ned went next door to speak to the old clerk,
Tim Linkinwater.

1087
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:14,250
When he returned, he brought Tim Linkinwater
with him.

1088
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:21,450
'We've decided,' Ned told Nicholas, 'that
you can work in the counting-house with Mr

1089
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:22,450
Linkinwater.

1090
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:24,170
Would you like that?'

1091
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:28,469
Nicholas's eyes filled with tears of happiness.

1092
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:30,760
He did not know what to say.

1093
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,540
'No, no, not a word now,' Charles said as
Nicholas tried to thank him.

1094
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,830
'You must return home.

1095
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:41,900
Your mother and sister will be worried about
you.

1096
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,960
After we have checked a few details about
you, Tim Linkinwater will visit you tonight.'

1097
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:53,360
Nicholas returned home and told everybody
his good news.

1098
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,510
That evening, Tim Linkinwater arrived and
invited Nicholas to start work the next morning.

1099
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:06,130
'The brothers will pay you 120 pounds a year,'
Tim informed him.

1100
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:11,380
'In addition to this, you and your family
are welcome to move into a small cottage that

1101
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,300
belongs to them.

1102
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:17,880
It's not far from the office, the rent is
very low, and they will also lend you the

1103
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,239
money to buy furniture.'

1104
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:28,179
One week later, Mrs Nickleby, Kate, Smike
and Nicholas moved into their new home.

1105
01:14:28,179 --> 01:14:39,760
Meanwhile, several miles away, Ralph Nickleby
was still busy planning his revenge.

1106
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,290
CHAPTER EIGHT
Kidnap

1107
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:51,320
As Smike was crossing the corner of a side-street,
he felt a hand on his collar.

1108
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,530
While Mrs Nickleby, Kate and Miss La Creevy
were busy decorating the cottage and Nicholas

1109
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:02,349
was busy in his new job, Smike spent all his
time working in the garden.

1110
01:15:02,349 --> 01:15:08,280
As the garden filled with flowers, his heart
filled with happiness.

1111
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,719
'You've made the garden a place of great beauty,
Smike,' Kate told him one evening, standing

1112
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:16,020
next him and looking at the flowers.

1113
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:20,329
'We're all so happy to see you so happy.'

1114
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:25,730
Mrs Nickleby also saw how enthusiastically
he worked and how much pleasure the garden

1115
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,239
gave him.

1116
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:32,239
She became very fond of him, too, and soon
everybody was treating him as a member of

1117
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,199
the family.

1118
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:37,980
Smike had never felt so happy.

1119
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:43,460
One evening, he was walking back to the cottage
in East London from Miss La Creevy's house.

1120
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,840
As he was crossing the corner of a side-street,
he felt a hand on his collar.

1121
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,880
Then he was pulled backwards and pushed against
a wall.

1122
01:15:52,880 --> 01:16:00,219
'Well, what a surprise!' said Wackford Squeers,
looking at Smike with his one eye.

1123
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:05,110
Then he turned to his son, who was jumping
up and down with excitement next to him.

1124
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:11,380
'Wackford, my boy, go and find a coach.'

1125
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,930
Smike fought and kicked as hard as he could,
but he was too weak to escape.

1126
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:21,630
Soon a coach arrived and Squeers pushed Smike
inside.

1127
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:27,150
He sat down opposite the frightened boy and
stared at him with an unpleasant smile.

1128
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:32,539
Then, with a loud laugh, he hit Smike several
times across the face.

1129
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:36,199
'It isn't a dream!' he laughed.

1130
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:37,199
'It's real.

1131
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,159
You thought that you could escape me, didn't
you?

1132
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,310
Well, you were wrong!'

1133
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,030
'Let me go home!'

1134
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,300
Smike cried, looking wildly around.

1135
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,300
'You are going home!'

1136
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,139
Squeers replied, hitting him again.

1137
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:56,250
'You'll soon be back at Dotheboys Hall, where
you belong.'

1138
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:04,860
After a long journey, the coach stopped outside
a small house with green windows.

1139
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:10,989
Squeers pulled Smike out of the coach, paid
the driver and pushed Smike into the house.

1140
01:17:10,989 --> 01:17:15,400
In the front room, a fat man was having dinner
with his wife.

1141
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:21,840
His name was Snawley, and he had sent his
two sons to Dotheboys Hall.

1142
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,440
When he had invited Squeers and his son to
stay at his house while they were in London,

1143
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,200
Squeers had accepted immediately - it was
much cheaper than staying at the Saracen's

1144
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Head!

1145
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:39,830
'Here's the boy that ran away and stole my
wife's ring,' Squeers told the surprised couple.

1146
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,040
'The ungrateful little animal!

1147
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,719
If there wasn't a lady here, I would hit him!'

1148
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:48,969
'Where has he been staying?'

1149
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:51,260
Mr Snawley asked.

1150
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,060
'Probably with that man Nickleby.

1151
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,710
Is that right, Smike?'

1152
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:01,160
Smike refused to answer, so Squeers pushed
him upstairs into a small room.

1153
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:06,139
He took the boy's shoes and coat and locked
him inside.

1154
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:11,429
The next morning, Squeers was having breakfast
at the Saracen's Head with his son when three

1155
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:12,809
people walked into the coffee-room.

1156
01:18:12,809 --> 01:18:18,801
His daughter, Fanny, with her friend Tilda
and Tilda's new husband, John Browdie, had

1157
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:22,909
just arrived from Yorkshire for a short holiday
in London.

1158
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:27,570
While they were all having breakfast, Squeers
told them about Smike.

1159
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:32,429
'Poor boy,' John Browdie said when Squeers
had finished his story.

1160
01:18:32,429 --> 01:18:34,940
'Where are you keeping him?'

1161
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:40,630
'On the top floor of my lodgings,' Squeers
replied.

1162
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,050
John Browdie laughed loudly and shook the
schoolmaster's hand.

1163
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:50,369
'The cleverest schoolmaster in all England!'
he said.

1164
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:51,619
'Congratulations!'

1165
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:56,719
'Thank you,' Squeers said, pulling his hand
away.

1166
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,099
'It's lucky you came today.

1167
01:18:58,099 --> 01:19:01,840
We're travelling back to Yorkshire tomorrow
morning.

1168
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,969
If you don't come for tea with me this evening,
you won't see us again in London.'

1169
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:13,360
'We'll be at your lodgings at six o'clock
tonight,' John Browdie promised.

1170
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,780
Squeers gave the farmer Mr Snawley's address,
then left with his son.

1171
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:24,300
That evening, John Browdie, Tilda and Fanny
arrived at Snawley's house at six o'clock

1172
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,520
exactly.

1173
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:31,750
John seemed strangely quiet while they were
having tea in the front room.

1174
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,900
After a short time he said, 'I don't feel
very well.

1175
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,070
It's probably the long journey and all the
excitement.

1176
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:43,480
I think I need to lie down for half an hour.'

1177
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,170
Tilda helped him upstairs into Squeers's bedroom.

1178
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:52,380
John closed his eyes, and Tilda returned downstairs.

1179
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,050
'He's sleeping like a baby,' she told the
others.

1180
01:19:56,050 --> 01:20:00,409
In fact, John Browdie was not sleeping at
all.

1181
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:06,769
When his wife had gone downstairs, he got
off the bed, took off his shoes and softly

1182
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:07,940
left the room.

1183
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:13,309
The key to the room next to his was still
in the door.

1184
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:18,909
Quietly turning it, he opened the door and
hurried inside, where Smike was lying quietly

1185
01:20:18,909 --> 01:20:21,300
on the bed under a thin blanket.

1186
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:29,639
'Don't be afraid,' John whispered, putting
his big hand gently over Smike's mouth.

1187
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:31,269
'I'm here to help you escape.'

1188
01:20:31,269 --> 01:20:38,860
Not knowing who this big stranger was, and
shaking with fear, Smike went with the farmer

1189
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:43,550
into the next bedroom, where he found his
coat and shoes on a chair.

1190
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:47,719
He put them on and followed the big man quietly
down the stairs.

1191
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:53,030
He felt even more frightened when he heard
Squeers and the others talking in the front

1192
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:54,800
room.

1193
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,530
'Don't worry,' John whispered when they reached
the bottom of the stairs.

1194
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:02,449
'I'll make sure that no one follows you.'

1195
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:04,890
He opened the front door quietly.

1196
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,890
'Quickly!

1197
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:08,780
Go now!'

1198
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:14,420
Smike gave Browdie a confused but grateful
look, and ran off into the darkness.

1199
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:20,980
A few hours later, he arrived at Newman Noggs's
lodgings and, after a hot drink, told him

1200
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,780
his story.

1201
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:27,070
'You're tired,' Noggs said, when Smike had
finished talking.

1202
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:29,760
'You must stay here for the night.

1203
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,590
I'll tell the others that you're back.

1204
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,650
They've been worried about you all day.'

1205
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:39,590
But Smike refused to be left alone and walked
with Noggs through the dark, empty streets

1206
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,639
of London.

1207
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:46,860
They arrived at the Nickleby's cottage just
as it was getting light.

1208
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,929
Everybody was relieved to see him.

1209
01:21:48,929 --> 01:21:55,340
There was much congratulation and noisy conversation,
and Smike cried with happiness to be safely

1210
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:03,830
back with his 'family' again.

1211
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:07,330
CHAPTER NINE
Love and War

1212
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:11,989
'But I have a secret that will interest you.

1213
01:22:11,989 --> 01:22:12,989
'

1214
01:22:12,989 --> 01:22:13,989
'Tell the world about it.

1215
01:22:13,989 --> 01:22:15,980
I don't care.'

1216
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:22,000
Later that morning, in the counting-house,
Nicholas found it difficult to work.

1217
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
He was thinking about how to punish Wackford
Squeers for kidnapping Smike.

1218
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,650
He was sure that his uncle had planned it.

1219
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:34,930
He was still thinking about this when he opened
the door into Charles Cheeryble's office.

1220
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:41,139
There, he saw a young lady on her knees at
Mr Cheeryble's feet.

1221
01:22:41,139 --> 01:22:46,619
It was the same girl that he had seen on his
first visit to the job agency!

1222
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:52,080
Nicholas was so filled with surprise and affected
by the girl's beauty that he could not move

1223
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,530
or speak.

1224
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:59,039
All thoughts of revenge against his uncle
and Squeers disappeared from his mind.

1225
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:06,460
There were tears in the girl's eyes as she
repeatedly thanked Mr Cheeryble for his kindness.

1226
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:12,449
Mr Cheeryble looked embarrassed and was asking
her to rise.

1227
01:23:12,449 --> 01:23:15,880
Nicholas quietly left the room before the
girl could see him.

1228
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:22,370
Later that morning, he asked Tim Linkinwater
about the young lady in Mr Cheeryble's office,

1229
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:26,670
but the old clerk pretended not to hear.

1230
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:32,800
Nicholas waited for the mysterious young lady's
next visit, but days passed and there was

1231
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,389
no sign of her.

1232
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:39,940
Then, one day, he was sent out on some unusual
business.

1233
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:43,960
He was sure that the young lady was visiting
the office while he was away.

1234
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,700
This happened several times.

1235
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:52,130
Why, Nicholas thought, was everybody so unwilling
to talk about her?

1236
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:58,539
As the days passed, Nicholas could think of
nothing except the beautiful young lady.

1237
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,449
Soon, he realised that he had fallen in love.

1238
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:05,300
He had to find out more informadon about her!

1239
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:09,010
Eventually, he could not keep the secret to
himself.

1240
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:12,910
He told Newman Noggs about her and Newman
promised to help.

1241
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:19,449
'The next time you're sent away on business,'
he said, 'I'll wait outside the building.

1242
01:24:19,449 --> 01:24:21,780
When she leaves, I'll follow her home.

1243
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:26,219
Then I can tell you where she lives.'

1244
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:30,800
Two days later, Nicholas was sent out on another
piece of strange business.

1245
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:36,340
That evening, he returned excitedly and asked
Newman for news.

1246
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,679
Unfortunately, Newman could not help him.

1247
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,500
He had followed the wrong girl!

1248
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:50,340
One evening, Ralph Nickleby was walking near
St James's Park, on his way home.

1249
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:55,389
Although he had collected a lot of money for
his business that day, he was in a bad mood.

1250
01:24:55,389 --> 01:25:02,510
His heart was still poisoned with anger for
his nephew, and he was still thinking of revenge.

1251
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:05,159
Sir Mulberry Hawk could not help him.

1252
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:10,489
He had been so badly hurt and publicly embarrassed
after his fight with Nicholas that he had

1253
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:13,869
left London as soon as possible.

1254
01:25:13,869 --> 01:25:17,610
Squeers had returned to Yorkshire, but that
was no problem.

1255
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:23,880
He was thinking of a plan, and Squeers was
going to help him succeed!

1256
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:30,199
While he was walking it began to rain, so
Ralph stood under a tree, still lost in thought.

1257
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:34,340
Suddenly, he noticed a man standing next to
him.

1258
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:41,539
He was the same age as he was, but wore dirty,
old clothes, and had a thin, hungry face.

1259
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:47,289
His skin was sunburnt, and his hair was pure
white.

1260
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,420
'You don't remember me, do you?'

1261
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,269
the man said.

1262
01:25:51,269 --> 01:25:52,929
Ralph stared at him.

1263
01:25:52,929 --> 01:25:55,130
Then he stepped back in shock.

1264
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,060
Yes, he remembered the man.

1265
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,340
His name was Brooker.

1266
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:04,670
He had known him for a long time, but he had
not seen him for eight years.

1267
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:08,739
'I used to be your friend,' Brooker reminded
him.

1268
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:10,010
'I'm hungry.

1269
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,060
I only need a little bread...'

1270
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:16,250
'Is this the way that you usually beg for
money?'

1271
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,280
Ralph coldly replied.

1272
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,610
'Yesterday was my first day back in London,
the old man continued.

1273
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,400
I've been looking for you.

1274
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,710
I'm nearly sixty years old and I have nothing
in the world.'

1275
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:32,300
'I'm sixty years old, too, Ralph said.

1276
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,170
But I don't beg people for bread.

1277
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:38,050
I work and earn money for it.'

1278
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:42,909
'I used to bring you good business, but you
never thanked me.

1279
01:26:42,909 --> 01:26:45,400
When I asked you for more money, you refused.

1280
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:51,270
Instead, you told the police about my debts
and I was sent away on a prison ship for eight

1281
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:52,599
years.

1282
01:26:52,599 --> 01:26:55,310
What help will you give me now:

1283
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,630
'None.'

1284
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:59,260
'But I have a secret that will interest you.'

1285
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,309
'Tell the world about it.

1286
01:27:01,309 --> 01:27:02,309
I don't care.

1287
01:27:02,309 --> 01:27:03,679
I'm not giving you any help.

1288
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:07,550
Now go away, or I shall make sure you go to
prison again.

1289
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:12,039
And this time you'll never get out.'

1290
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:15,610
With those words, Ralph walked off into the
rain.

1291
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:21,590
Brooker stared at his back, his eyes filled
with hate.

1292
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:29,159
At the end of their holiday in London, John
Browdie and Tilda were having tea at the Nicklebys'

1293
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:30,159
cottage.

1294
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:35,530
While everybody was laughing and joking, there
was a loud knock on the door and Ralph Nickleby

1295
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:40,180
walked in, followed by Wackford Squeers and
Mr Snawley.

1296
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:45,079
'Listen to what I have to say,' he told them.

1297
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:50,309
John Browdie and Nicholas stood up angrily,
but Ralph looked straight past them at Mrs

1298
01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:51,309
Nickleby.

1299
01:27:51,309 --> 01:27:53,639
'I shall talk to you, ma'am,' he said.

1300
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:57,179
'I know that your mad son will refuse to listen
to me.

1301
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:02,080
I am here to return a child to his parent.'

1302
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,400
He pointed at Smike, who was shaking with
fear behind Nicholas's back.

1303
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,079
'I have brought that boy's father here with
me tonight.'

1304
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,150
'My son!'

1305
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:17,719
cried Mr Snawley, hurrying past Nicholas and
taking Smike in his arms.

1306
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:20,469
'I've found you at last!'

1307
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:26,620
'This is the boy's father,' Ralph said, pointing
at Snawley, 'and here are the documents that

1308
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,620
prove it.'

1309
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:33,139
He left the documents on the table for Nicholas
and John Browdie to study.

1310
01:28:33,139 --> 01:28:40,289
'Dear Nicholas,' Kate said at last, looking
over her brother's shoulder, 'is it true?'

1311
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:44,050
'I'm afraid it is,' Nicholas replied quietly.

1312
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,469
'Good!' said Squeers.

1313
01:28:46,469 --> 01:28:48,289
'So he's coming with us.

1314
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:53,190
There's a coach waiting outside, and the horses
are getting cold.'

1315
01:28:53,190 --> 01:28:55,469
'No!'

1316
01:28:55,469 --> 01:28:58,349
cried Smike, pulling away from Snawley.

1317
01:28:58,349 --> 01:29:01,010
'I'm not leaving!'

1318
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:06,440
Squeers moved forwards, but John Browdie pushed
him away and he fell to the floor.

1319
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:12,329
After a lot of loud argument and angry shouting,
Nicholas picked Squeers up by the collar and

1320
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:14,280
threw him out of the door.

1321
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,599
'I want my son,' Snawley demanded.

1322
01:29:18,599 --> 01:29:21,380
Your son wants to stay here,' Nicholas replied.

1323
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:26,070
'And I will not let him go back to that school!'

1324
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:29,870
Snawley left the room, but Ralph stayed behind.

1325
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:32,829
He stared at Nicholas angrily.

1326
01:29:32,829 --> 01:29:43,199
Mr Snawley is the boy's father,' he said,
'and he will have him.'

1327
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,579
CHAPTER TEN
Madeline Bray

1328
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:52,670
Nicholas left the room and went down the stairs,
his heart illed with happiness.

1329
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:58,090
He had found his love at last!

1330
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:03,389
The next day, Nicholas told Charles Cheeryble
everything that had happened.

1331
01:30:03,389 --> 01:30:05,500
Charles listened carefully.

1332
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,420
'Your story does not surprise me,' he said.

1333
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,190
'Your uncle visited us this morning.

1334
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:16,420
He came here to complain about you, to poison
our ears with lies.

1335
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:19,290
But we refused to listen and made him leave.'

1336
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:22,760
'How can I ever thank you?'

1337
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,250
Nicholas said, relieved that he had such good
friends.

1338
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:31,800
'By saying nothing more about the subject,'
Charles replied.

1339
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,800
'Don't worry.

1340
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,829
We shall protect you and your family.

1341
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:37,469
But now I have a job for you.

1342
01:30:37,469 --> 01:30:40,230
It's a special job.

1343
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:45,050
You accidentally saw a young lady in my office
some time ago.

1344
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:47,449
Or perhaps you have forgotten...

1345
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:52,480
'Oh no, sir,' Nicholas said, a feeling of
great excitement rising inside him.

1346
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,210
'I remember it very well.'

1347
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:59,570
'Her mother was a very beautiful woman,' Charles
said.

1348
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:04,150
'I was in love with her, but she married another
man.

1349
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:06,429
Their life was not happy.

1350
01:31:06,429 --> 01:31:13,770
They had a daughter - the girl you saw in
my office - but they had no money.

1351
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:18,170
Twelve months before her death, the mother
came to me for help.

1352
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:22,340
I gave her money, which her husband wasted.

1353
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:27,130
When she died, she was a sad, heart-broken
woman.

1354
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:30,090
'Her husband is still alive.

1355
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:35,480
He owes money to a lot of people, and he lives
in a secret place to hide from them.

1356
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,989
His daughter worked for two long years to
give him money, but eventually she needed

1357
01:31:40,989 --> 01:31:42,300
help.

1358
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:47,900
She came to me because I had been a friend
of her mother's, and I offered to help her.

1359
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,690
But she only accepted a very small amount
of money.

1360
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:55,980
I wanted to help her more, but she refused.

1361
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:00,199
Her father is still alive and he hates me.

1362
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:04,340
He knows that his wife really wanted to marry
me.

1363
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,889
If he knew the money came from me, he would
waste it all.

1364
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:15,290
Madeline comes to me secretly, usually by
night, but only accepts the smallest amount

1365
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:16,969
of money.

1366
01:32:16,969 --> 01:32:21,650
This situation cannot continue, Nicholas,
and I want you to help me.

1367
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:24,250
'I'd be glad to,' Nicholas said.

1368
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:26,789
'What do you want me to do?'

1369
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:30,659
She's a wonderful artist, but she doesn't
sell anything.

1370
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:34,730
You can visit her and pay for some paintings.

1371
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:39,130
Madeline will know that Ned and I have sent
you, but her father will not know that you

1372
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:41,030
have not ordered any.

1373
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:46,280
You will pay a good price and her father will
not know that the money comes from Ned and

1374
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,280
myself.'

1375
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,340
Nicholas, of course, agreed to help at once.

1376
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:57,600
The young lady and her father (whose name
was Bray) lived in a cheap, dirty house near

1377
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,699
the prison.

1378
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:04,330
Nicholas knocked on the door nervously, and
was shown upstairs.

1379
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:09,170
Although there was not much furniture, the
small room was filled with flowers and paintings.

1380
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:16,090
And at a little table by the window sat the
young lady of Nicholas's dreams!

1381
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:20,420
She was quietly painting, and seemed to Nicholas
more beautiful than ever.

1382
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:29,159
In a chair by the empty fireplace sat her
father - a sick man in his fifties who looked

1383
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:30,429
much older.

1384
01:33:30,429 --> 01:33:34,510
'Madeline, who is this?'

1385
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:35,630
Mr Bray said.

1386
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:39,929
'Who said that strangers could visit us here?'

1387
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:44,170
'I've come to pay for some paintings that
your daughter did for me, Mr Bray,' Nicholas

1388
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:47,780
said, placing an envelope on the table in
front of the girl.

1389
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:51,489
'Check the money, Madeline,' Mr Bray said.

1390
01:33:51,489 --> 01:33:56,309
'I'm sure the money's correct, Father,' Madeline
said softly.

1391
01:33:56,309 --> 01:33:58,929
'If that's true, ring the bell.

1392
01:33:58,929 --> 01:34:04,420
Tell the servant to get me a newspaper, some
fresh fruit and a bottle of wine!'

1393
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:09,270
'I also want to order something else,' Nicholas
said.

1394
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:11,540
'Perhaps a picture of the trees in the park?

1395
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:15,090
Don't worry about the time or cost.

1396
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,110
When would you like me to call again?'

1397
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:22,730
'Three or four weeks,' Madeline replied, looking
at Nicholas shyly.

1398
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:24,570
'No - sooner!'

1399
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:25,579
her father said.

1400
01:34:25,579 --> 01:34:29,230
'We'll need more money before then!'

1401
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:34,920
Nicholas left the room and went down the stairs,
his heart filled with happiness.

1402
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,139
He had found his love at last!

1403
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:45,910
Meanwhile, several miles away, Ralph was talking
to a man in his office.

1404
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:50,260
Arthur Gride was also a moneylender.

1405
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:55,949
He was an ugly old man of about seventy-five
years old, with a pointed chin, toothless

1406
01:34:55,949 --> 01:34:59,570
mouth and unhealthy yellow skin.

1407
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,579
But this did not stop him from talking about
love!

1408
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:07,420
'I'm a lucky man,' said Arthur Gride.

1409
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,710
'I'm going to get married.'

1410
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:10,020
'You?

1411
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:13,699
Who would want to marry you?'

1412
01:35:13,699 --> 01:35:15,400
Ralph smiled scornfully.

1413
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,599
'A toothless old woman as ugly as yourself?'

1414
01:35:18,599 --> 01:35:21,829
'No,' Arthur said.

1415
01:35:21,829 --> 01:35:28,559
'She's a beautiful young girl with dark eyes,
and lovely red lips - and she's only eighteen

1416
01:35:28,559 --> 01:35:29,710
years old!'

1417
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,869
'What s her name?'

1418
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:34,920
Ralph asked, staring at Gride coldly.

1419
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,610
'Do you remember Walter Bray?

1420
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:42,360
We both did business with him, and he owes
us both money.

1421
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:46,570
I've visited him several times over the last
six months.

1422
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:49,190
He owes me 1700 pounds.'

1423
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:53,050
'And he owes me over 900 pounds,' Ralph said.

1424
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:56,170
'But why are you telling me about him now?

1425
01:35:56,170 --> 01:36:00,559
'Well, I'm going to marry his daughter, Madeline.

1426
01:36:00,559 --> 01:36:03,960
I haven't asked her father yet, but he'll
agree.

1427
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:08,270
If he lets me marry his daughter, I'll forget
his debts.

1428
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:12,170
I'll even give him some money and a place
to live across the river.

1429
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:16,380
I've talked to his doctor, and he won't live
long.

1430
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:20,739
He's certain to agree to my request, don't
you think?

1431
01:36:20,739 --> 01:36:24,760
His daughter will have to obey him, but I
need your help.'

1432
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:25,760
'How?'

1433
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,060
'I'm a shy, nervous man.

1434
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:33,140
I need you to talk to the father for me.

1435
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,969
You're good with words.

1436
01:36:34,969 --> 01:36:37,809
He'll listen to you.'

1437
01:36:37,809 --> 01:36:40,079
'There's something more, isn't there?'

1438
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:44,519
Ralph said, narrowing his eyes and studying
Arthur's ugly old face.

1439
01:36:44,519 --> 01:36:46,260
'No, no...'

1440
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,000
'Don't lie.

1441
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,060
I know you.

1442
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,880
You're as greedy as I am.

1443
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,499
If you don't tell me everything, I won't help
you.'

1444
01:36:54,499 --> 01:36:59,969
'Well, there's a little house that belongs
to this girl.

1445
01:36:59,969 --> 01:37:03,329
Nobody knows about it - not even her.

1446
01:37:03,329 --> 01:37:06,590
If I marry her, the house will be mine.'

1447
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:10,340
'All right,' Ralph said, smiling thoughtfully.

1448
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:12,559
'I agree to help you.

1449
01:37:12,559 --> 01:37:17,079
But you must promise to pay me all of the
money that Bray owes me.

1450
01:37:17,079 --> 01:37:22,139
I also want an extra 500 pounds.'

1451
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:26,050
After much complaining, Gride unwillingly
agreed.

1452
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:31,309
The two men left immediately to visit Walter
Bray and, after half an hour of listening

1453
01:37:31,309 --> 01:37:39,719
to Ralph, Bray agreed to his daughter's marriage
one week later.

1454
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:42,449
Life for the Nicklebys in their cottage was
good.

1455
01:37:42,449 --> 01:37:44,909
The Cheeryble brothers visited them often.

1456
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:49,650
Sometimes, they brought with them their nephew,
Frank, who had just returned from abroad.

1457
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:53,810
They spent many happy evenings together.

1458
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:57,690
Although Nicholas was happy, too, he was worried
about Smike.

1459
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:00,880
The boy had recently become much quieter.

1460
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:06,059
He also seemed to be growing weaker, and spent
more time alone in his room.

1461
01:38:06,059 --> 01:38:09,750
However, the doctor told Nicholas not to worry.

1462
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:14,949
The kidnap had been a bad experience for Smike,
and he needed time to forget it.

1463
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:20,510
One night, while Frank Cheeryble was telling
Mrs Nickleby and Kate about his adventures

1464
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:24,010
abroad, Nicholas went up to Smike's room.

1465
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:26,810
The boy was lying quietly in his bed.

1466
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:29,019
'What's the matter?'

1467
01:38:29,019 --> 01:38:30,349
Nicholas asked softly.

1468
01:38:30,349 --> 01:38:32,210
'Are you feeling ill?'

1469
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:36,309
'No, I'm all right,' Smike replied.

1470
01:38:36,309 --> 01:38:38,610
But you seem so sad.

1471
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:41,110
Won't you tell me why?'

1472
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:42,940
'I can't.

1473
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:43,940
Not now.

1474
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:46,599
I hate myself for being like this.

1475
01:38:46,599 --> 01:38:50,130
You're all so good and kind to me.

1476
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,619
But my heart is full.

1477
01:38:51,619 --> 01:38:54,350
You don't know how full it is.

1478
01:38:54,350 --> 01:39:02,699
One day, I'll tell you the reason.

1479
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:05,251
CHAPTER ELEVEN
An Evil Marriage

1480
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:13,440
'No gentleman would make his daughter do what
you are making your daughter do.'

1481
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:18,700
Nicholas met Newman Noggs for a drink and
Noggs gave him news about his uncle.

1482
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:25,830
A strange man called Brooker kept coming to
the office, but Ralph refused to meet him.

1483
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:31,699
Nicholas then told Noggs about his job, and
about the beautiful girl with the sick father.

1484
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:35,519
When he told him her name, Newman jumped up
from his chair.

1485
01:39:35,519 --> 01:39:38,019
'Oh, no!' he cried.

1486
01:39:38,019 --> 01:39:42,719
'How can you do nothing and let this terrible
marriage happen?'

1487
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:43,900
'What do you mean?'

1488
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,380
Nicholas said, confused by his friend's strange
behaviour.

1489
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:49,440
'Haven't you heard?'

1490
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:53,239
Newman said, his eyes moving around wildly.

1491
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:58,349
'Tomorrow she's going to marry a horrible
old moneylender called Arthur Gride - a man

1492
01:39:58,349 --> 01:40:01,449
worse than your uncle, if that's possible.

1493
01:40:01,449 --> 01:40:03,110
Your uncle has arranged it all.

1494
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:06,989
I heard them discussing it in his office last
week.'

1495
01:40:06,989 --> 01:40:09,980
Nicholas stood up and forced Newman down into
his chair.

1496
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:14,200
'Tell me everything!' he demanded.

1497
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,020
Newman told him the details of what he had
heard.

1498
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:20,730
When he had finished, a wild look came into
Nicholas's eyes.

1499
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:23,820
'What are you going to do?'

1500
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:25,640
Newman asked, frightened.

1501
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,639
'What can I do?'

1502
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:30,579
Nicholas replied, his face pale with anger.

1503
01:40:30,579 --> 01:40:33,849
'The brothers are out of town on business.

1504
01:40:33,849 --> 01:40:36,550
If I visit my uncle, I'll only make things
worse.

1505
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:42,360
No, I must go and see Madeline immediately
and tell her of my true feelings for her.

1506
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:47,340
When her father sees how much I love his daughter,
perhaps he'll change his mind.

1507
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,260
It's my only hope!'

1508
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:55,809
Before Newman could say anything to stop him,
Nicholas ran out into the street.

1509
01:40:55,809 --> 01:41:00,829
When he arrived at their lodgings, Madeline
and her father were sitting in their room.

1510
01:41:00,829 --> 01:41:05,850
Nicholas had not seen Madeline for three weeks,
and he was shocked by the terrible paleness

1511
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:09,580
of her face and the dark shadows under her
lovely eyes.

1512
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,929
The room had changed, too.

1513
01:41:12,929 --> 01:41:16,809
There were no paintings on the walls or flowers
on the table.

1514
01:41:16,809 --> 01:41:19,429
'What do you want?

1515
01:41:19,429 --> 01:41:21,539
Bray said from his chair by the fire.

1516
01:41:21,539 --> 01:41:27,239
'Be quick, because my daughter and I have
important things to think about.

1517
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:31,159
'There's something that I need to discuss
with your daughter in private, sir,' Nicholas

1518
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:33,900
said politely, hiding his anger with difficulty.

1519
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:40,559
'We don't need your business anymore,' Bray
replied rudely 'So you can leave, unless you

1520
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:42,719
have something else to say?'

1521
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,560
'Only this,' Nicholas said, unable to control
his anger anymore.

1522
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:52,050
'I thought you were a gentleman, sir, but
I was wrong.

1523
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:56,380
No gentleman would make his daughter do what
you are making your daughter do.'

1524
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:59,250
'You can't talk to me like that!'

1525
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,280
Bray said angrily.

1526
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:03,809
'You're only an ordinary shop-boy!'

1527
01:42:03,809 --> 01:42:07,610
He tried to stand up, but his anger had made
him weak.

1528
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:10,510
He fell back in his chair and closed his eyes.

1529
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:16,289
Nicholas took Madeline's arm and led her quietly
out of the room.

1530
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:20,530
'If you have more business for me,' Madeline
said anxiously when they were outside the

1531
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:24,199
room, 'please leave it until the day after
tomorrow.'

1532
01:42:24,199 --> 01:42:28,639
'That will be too late,' Nicholas replied.

1533
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:32,619
Madeline tried to walk away, but Nicholas
gently stopped her.

1534
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:35,469
'Please listen to me,' he said.

1535
01:42:35,469 --> 01:42:40,809
She stared at him quietly as he tried to persuade
her not to marry Arthur Gride.

1536
01:42:40,809 --> 01:42:44,820
'I have no choice,' she explained.

1537
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:48,130
'It is my duty to my father.'

1538
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:52,869
He tried again, but she refused to listen
and she went back into the room to be with

1539
01:42:52,869 --> 01:42:55,829
her father.

1540
01:42:55,829 --> 01:42:59,349
Nicholas returned home, his heart aching with
unhappiness.

1541
01:42:59,349 --> 01:43:03,140
That evening, he visited Arthur Gride.

1542
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:07,110
He told the old moneylender that Madeline
Bray hated him.

1543
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:12,920
'If you were a gentleman, you would think
about the pain in that innocent girl's heart,'

1544
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,230
Nicholas said.

1545
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:21,139
Gride listened to him in scornful silence,
then said, 'I understand you better than you

1546
01:43:21,139 --> 01:43:22,289
think.

1547
01:43:22,289 --> 01:43:24,489
You want her for yourself, don't you?

1548
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:26,150
But you can't have her!

1549
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:28,860
She's my lovely little wife.

1550
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:30,670
Do you think she'll cry for you?

1551
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:37,269
I hope so, because she looks prettier in tears.'

1552
01:43:37,269 --> 01:43:41,949
'You evil old man,' Nicholas said, his face
red with anger.

1553
01:43:41,949 --> 01:43:47,869
Without warning, Arthur Gride ran across the
room and put his head out of the window.

1554
01:43:47,869 --> 01:43:49,139
'Help!

1555
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:52,510
Help!' he shouted into the street.

1556
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:53,519
'Thief!

1557
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:54,519
Robber!'

1558
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:59,440
Nicholas was so angry that he almost attacked
Arthur Gride.

1559
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:04,840
Instead, he turned quickly and left the room.

1560
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:09,389
The next morning, Arthur Gride got up early
and put on his best suit.

1561
01:44:09,389 --> 01:44:15,309
He spoke to his half-deaf old housekeeper,
Peg Sliderskew, about the arrangements for

1562
01:44:15,309 --> 01:44:19,730
food, and then he went to Ralph Nickleby's
house.

1563
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:23,760
Ralph laughed when he heard about his nephews
visit the night before.

1564
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,309
'Good!' he thought.

1565
01:44:25,309 --> 01:44:29,440
'I'm getting revenge on him at last!'

1566
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:34,030
The two men hired a coach and went to Walter
Bray's lodgings.

1567
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:36,849
'Where's the lucky girl?'

1568
01:44:36,849 --> 01:44:40,329
Ralph asked Bray as soon as he and Gride had
entered the room.

1569
01:44:40,329 --> 01:44:44,460
'She was very ill last night,' Bray explained.

1570
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:46,369
'She's crying in her room.

1571
01:44:46,369 --> 01:44:49,260
But don't worry; she'll be better in a minute.

1572
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:53,340
It's only a girl's usual nervousness just
before her wedding.'

1573
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,320
'She won't delay us, will she?'

1574
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,320
Ralph asked.

1575
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:00,170
'No, I've been talking to her all morning.

1576
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,719
She'll be down in a minute,' Bray replied.

1577
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:09,469
Arthur Gride sat in a corner of the room and
played impatiently with the buttons of his

1578
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:11,570
coat.

1579
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:13,829
Bray looked at him scornfully.

1580
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:17,619
'Look at that man,' he whispered to Ralph.

1581
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:23,780
'This marriage is a cruel thing to do to an
innocent young girl, don't you think?'

1582
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:29,880
'No,' Ralph replied coldly, surprised by Bray's
sudden pity for his daughter.

1583
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:33,460
'It would be more cruel if he were younger.

1584
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,980
He's an old man.

1585
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:39,449
He'll die soon, and Miss Madeline will become
a rich young widow.'

1586
01:45:39,449 --> 01:45:47,829
'That's true,' Bray said thoughtfully, but
he still did not look happy.

1587
01:45:47,829 --> 01:45:51,050
'I'll go upstairs to finish dressing,' he
said.

1588
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:56,340
'When I come down, I'll bring Madeline with
me.'

1589
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:59,949
When he had left the room, Ralph turned to
Gride.

1590
01:45:59,949 --> 01:46:02,760
'He looks very ill,' he said.

1591
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,770
'If he doesn't die soon, I'll be very surprised.'

1592
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:11,809
Gride laughed quietly, but did not reply.

1593
01:46:11,809 --> 01:46:14,989
The two men sat waiting in silence.

1594
01:46:14,989 --> 01:46:21,130
After a short time, they heard footsteps outside
the door - but it was not Bray and his daughter.

1595
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:24,520
It was Nicholas and his sister, Kate!

1596
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:27,599
Ralph stood up, his face pale with anger.

1597
01:46:27,599 --> 01:46:31,289
Gride took Ralph's arm, his eyes filled with
fear.

1598
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:33,579
'What do you want?'

1599
01:46:33,579 --> 01:46:34,579
Ralph demanded.

1600
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:39,449
'I've come here to save Madeline from this
evil marriage,' Nicholas replied.

1601
01:46:39,449 --> 01:46:42,910
'Leave the room, girl,' Ralph told Kate.

1602
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:47,250
'I advise you not to see what I'm going to
do to your brother.'

1603
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:52,289
'I will not go,' Kate said, standing proudly
by her brother.

1604
01:46:52,289 --> 01:46:54,519
'I'm going to speak to the girl and her father.

1605
01:46:54,519 --> 01:46:56,550
Perhaps they will listen to me.'

1606
01:46:56,550 --> 01:47:04,250
'I know how jealous your brother is, Arthur
Gride said from behind Ralph's back.

1607
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:06,520
'But it's too late!

1608
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,800
The girl is mine!

1609
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,350
Suddenly, there was a loud scream from the
room above them.

1610
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:16,940
Nicholas ran upstairs and saw a crowd of neighbours
already in the bedroom.

1611
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:18,679
'What's happened?'

1612
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:20,540
Nicholas asked.

1613
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,710
'It's Mr Bray,' replied an old woman.

1614
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:25,610
'He's dead.'

1615
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:30,570
Nicholas pushed through the crowd and saw
Bray lying on the floor.

1616
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:34,150
Madeline was lying with her head on his shoulder,
crying.

1617
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:39,190
Nicholas gently took her arm and led her from
the room.

1618
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:43,539
'I'm the young girl's nearest friend,' he
informed the watching crowd of neighbours.

1619
01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:48,719
'My sister and I will take care of her until
she is well.'

1620
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:53,769
Nobody tried to stop him as he led Madeline,
who was too upset and shocked to refuse, down

1621
01:47:53,769 --> 01:47:56,340
the stairs and into the street.

1622
01:47:56,340 --> 01:48:02,559
As Kate ran across the road to hire a coach,
Ralph called from the doorway, 'Leave the

1623
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:03,670
girl here!'

1624
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:10,390
'I warn you,' Nicholas shouted back at his
uncle, 'that your evil world is finished!'

1625
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:15,860
With those words, he helped Madeline into
the coach which Kate had found.

1626
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:20,960
Ralph angrily watched the coach disappear
around a corner, then unwillingly agreed to

1627
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,760
go back to Gride s house.

1628
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,349
When they arrived, Gride knocked on the door,
but there was no answer.

1629
01:48:28,349 --> 01:48:30,230
'What's the matter?'

1630
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:31,320
Ralph said impatiently.

1631
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,519
'Why doesn't anyone answer?'

1632
01:48:33,519 --> 01:48:38,489
'It's Peg, my housekeeper,' Gride explained.

1633
01:48:38,489 --> 01:48:40,139
'She's deaf.'

1634
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:45,060
He knocked more loudly until the whole street
could hear him, but still no one answered

1635
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,190
the door.

1636
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:51,520
Finally, the two moneylenders climbed over
a fence into Gride's back yard.

1637
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,510
The house was dark and empty.

1638
01:48:54,510 --> 01:49:00,739
The two men looked in every room, but there
was no sign of Peg.

1639
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:06,630
Then Gride fell on his knees beside a large
box and screamed like an animal in pain.

1640
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:10,949
'I've been robbed!' he cried.

1641
01:49:10,949 --> 01:49:11,949
'Robbed?

1642
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:13,579
Of money?'

1643
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:14,679
Ralph wanted to know.

1644
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:17,350
'No, worse than money!

1645
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:19,360
Worse than money!'

1646
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:22,079
Gride shouted, throwing papers around the
room.

1647
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:26,820
'It's my business papers with all my secret
information.

1648
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,829
She saw me reading them last night.

1649
01:49:28,829 --> 01:49:33,489
She'll show them to someone and they'll take
all my money.

1650
01:49:33,489 --> 01:49:35,250
She's destroyed me!'

1651
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,429
'Calm down!'

1652
01:49:36,429 --> 01:49:38,650
Ralph said, shaking Gride roughly.

1653
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:40,710
'She probably isn't far away.

1654
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:42,340
I'll call the police...'

1655
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,340
'No!'

1656
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,219
Gride shouted, even more frightened than before.

1657
01:49:46,219 --> 01:49:52,070
'If the police see my papers, I'll go to prison!'

1658
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:55,940
Eventually, when Gride had calmed down, Ralph
went home.

1659
01:49:55,940 --> 01:50:01,599
A short time later, he sent Newman Noggs with
a letter to the Saracen's Head.

1660
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:09,389
'If Mr Squeers is there,' he told Newman,
'tell him to see me at once.'

1661
01:50:09,389 --> 01:50:14,460
When Squeers arrived, Ralph told him how his
nephew had ruined Arthur Gride's wedding to

1662
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:15,810
Madeline Bray.

1663
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:20,869
'If my nephew marries her, he'll become a
very rich man,' he said.

1664
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:24,550
'And that will make him a very dangerous enemy.'

1665
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:27,869
'How will he become rich?'

1666
01:50:27,869 --> 01:50:30,639
'It seems that Madeline owns a house.

1667
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,809
She doesn't know it, but there are secret
documents to prove it.

1668
01:50:34,809 --> 01:50:38,690
Arthur Gride had the papers, but his housekeeper
has stolen them.

1669
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:43,449
I want you to find this woman, and bring the
papers to me.

1670
01:50:43,449 --> 01:50:47,269
If I can destroy them, my nephew will never
get the money.

1671
01:50:47,269 --> 01:50:52,989
I'll pay you fifty pounds as soon as I have
those papers.'

1672
01:50:52,989 --> 01:50:59,369
Squeers listened to this with greedy ears,
his one eye and his mouth wide open.

1673
01:50:59,369 --> 01:51:03,330
'But how do I know where to find her?' he
asked.

1674
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:05,380
'Don't worry about that.

1675
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:10,210
People have tried to hide from me before,
but I've always found them.

1676
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:13,320
When I know where she is, I'll tell you.

1677
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,639
Your part of the job will be easy.

1678
01:51:15,639 --> 01:51:18,080
You will become her friend.

1679
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:22,599
Then you can discover where she has hidden
the papers.

1680
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:30,590
Squeers thought for a moment, then said, 'I'll
do it for a hundred pounds.'

1681
01:51:30,590 --> 01:51:37,749
Ralph agreed immediately.

1682
01:51:37,749 --> 01:51:40,170
CHAPTER TWELVE
Poor Smike

1683
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:44,840
'I saw him - over there, behind the trees!

1684
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:51,570
It was the man who took me to that horrible
school, years ago!'

1685
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:56,479
Madeline was now living with the Nicklebys
in their cottage, but the shock of her father's

1686
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,550
death had made her very ill.

1687
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:04,820
While she stayed in bed, Kate took care of
her, and by the time Madeline's health improved

1688
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:08,489
she and Kate had become good friends.

1689
01:52:08,489 --> 01:52:11,360
These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby.

1690
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:16,460
She noticed that Frank Cheeryble often came
to the cottage with Nicholas after work.

1691
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:21,420
She was sure that he was interested in Kate,
and began to dream of a wonderful wedding

1692
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,989
for her daughter!

1693
01:52:23,989 --> 01:52:29,349
When she told Nicholas about Frank's interest
in Kate, Nicholas was surprised, but he was

1694
01:52:29,349 --> 01:52:32,199
also secretly relieved.

1695
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:35,960
He had been afraid that Frank was also in
love in Madeline.

1696
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:41,840
He liked Frank a lot, and he was glad that
they would not have to become enemies.

1697
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:48,949
However, Nicholas became increasingly worried
about Smike, who had become very ill.

1698
01:52:48,949 --> 01:52:53,409
The doctor told him that Smike's condition
was serious and he advised him to take the

1699
01:52:53,409 --> 01:52:56,869
boy away from London as soon as possible.

1700
01:52:56,869 --> 01:52:59,820
The fresh country air might cure him.

1701
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:06,429
So Nicholas took Smike to Devon, in southwest
England, where he had lived as a child.

1702
01:53:06,429 --> 01:53:13,960
Meanwhile, Ralph Nickleby had discovered where
Peg Sliderskew, Gride's housekeeper, was living.

1703
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:20,340
She was in an upper room in a dirty old house
near Lambeth, in southeast London.

1704
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:25,559
Ralph informed Squeers, who moved into an
empty room in the same house and soon became

1705
01:53:25,559 --> 01:53:27,719
friendly with her.

1706
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:33,250
One evening, he took a bottle of strong alcohol
into her room and sat talking to her by the

1707
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,349
fire.

1708
01:53:35,349 --> 01:53:40,309
After the old woman had drunk a few glasses,
Squeers told her how Arthur Gride's wedding

1709
01:53:40,309 --> 01:53:42,119
plans were ruined.

1710
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:47,790
Peg Sliderskew laughed so much that she nearly
fell out of her chair.

1711
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:50,190
'I'm glad,' she said.

1712
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,219
'Gride's a horrible, greedy old man.

1713
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:55,940
He treated me very badly.

1714
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:59,360
That's why I ran away with his papers.'

1715
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:05,010
'I'll be happy to help with Gride's papers,'
Squeers suggested, when Peg was completely

1716
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,010
drunk.

1717
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:11,170
'I can tell you which ones to keep and which
ones to burn.'

1718
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:15,079
The old woman walked with a drunken smile
to a cupboard.

1719
01:54:15,079 --> 01:54:20,619
She took the papers out of a box and spread
them out on the floor by the fire.

1720
01:54:20,619 --> 01:54:25,870
Squeers was so busy studying them that he
did not hear the door opening behind him.

1721
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:31,800
He did not see Frank Cheeryble and Newman
Noggs walking quietly into the room.

1722
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,730
Eventually, he found the paper that he wanted.

1723
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:40,570
'Madeline Bray!' he said excitedly, putting
it in his coat pocket.

1724
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:42,630
'What did you say?'

1725
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:44,780
Peg asked, turning her head.

1726
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,659
She saw the two men, but it was too late to
save Squeers.

1727
01:54:49,659 --> 01:54:55,289
Newman Noggs lifted his arm and brought a
thick stick down heavily onto his head.

1728
01:54:55,289 --> 01:55:00,730
The old schoolmaster's one eye opened wide
with surprise, then he fell forwards across

1729
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:01,960
the floor.

1730
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:08,960
After a two-day journey to Devon, Nicholas
rented a small farmhouse.

1731
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:14,710
At first, Smike was strong enough to go for
short walks in the surrounding fields.

1732
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:20,099
Nicholas also hired a horse and cart and drove
Smike around the countryside.

1733
01:55:20,099 --> 01:55:25,820
He showed the boy the house where he had lived,
and he even found a rose-tree in the garden

1734
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:29,559
that his little sister Kate had planted.

1735
01:55:29,559 --> 01:55:34,550
However, as Smike grew weaker, travelling
became impossible.

1736
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:39,949
On sunny days, Nicholas sat outside with him
under some apple trees.

1737
01:55:39,949 --> 01:55:44,550
One evening, they were watching the sun go
down behind the hills.

1738
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:47,200
It was so warm that Nicholas fell asleep.

1739
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,170
Suddenly, he was woken by a scream.

1740
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:53,340
'What is it?' he asked anxiously.

1741
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:56,780
'I saw him - over there, behind the trees!

1742
01:55:56,780 --> 01:56:02,010
It was the man who took me to that horrible
school, years ago!'

1743
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:05,949
Nicholas searched among the trees, but there
was no one there.

1744
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:09,229
'You were dreaming,' he said when he returned.

1745
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:15,340
'No, I wasn't dreaming,' Smike replied, holding
tightly onto Nicholas's arm.

1746
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:17,639
'Promise me you'll never leave me!

1747
01:56:17,639 --> 01:56:18,760
Promise!'

1748
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:23,280
Over the next few days, Smike became much
weaker.

1749
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,510
Nicholas saw now that there was no hope for
his young friend.

1750
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:34,340
A life of suffering and pain had made him
too weak to fight his illness.

1751
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:39,639
One fine, autumn day, Nicholas sat by Smike's
bedside.

1752
01:56:39,639 --> 01:56:43,210
Smike was lying with his eyes closed, breathing
gently.

1753
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:45,830
Suddenly, he opened his eyes.

1754
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:49,909
There was a small smile on his pale face.

1755
01:56:49,909 --> 01:56:55,650
'I've had such pleasant dreams,' he said softly.

1756
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:57,230
'What about?'

1757
01:56:57,230 --> 01:56:58,239
Nicholas asked.

1758
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:03,150
The dying boy turned towards him and hugged
his neck.

1759
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:06,190
'I shall soon be there.'

1760
01:57:06,190 --> 01:57:12,019
There was a short silence, then Smike spoke
again.

1761
01:57:12,019 --> 01:57:14,670
'I'm not afraid to die,' he said.

1762
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:18,600
'But first I must tell you something.

1763
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:24,110
You've been so good to me, and I can't keep
any secrets from you.

1764
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:26,999
You asked me once why I had changed.

1765
01:57:26,999 --> 01:57:28,539
Do you remember?

1766
01:57:28,539 --> 01:57:31,190
You wondered why I spent so much time alone.

1767
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:33,719
Shall I tell you why?'

1768
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:37,810
Not if it makes you unhappy.'

1769
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:42,050
Smike explained that he had been in love with
Nicholas's sister.

1770
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:45,619
'I've been so unhappy,' he said.

1771
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:47,090
'I'm so sorry.

1772
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:50,429
Will you ever forgive me?'

1773
01:57:50,429 --> 01:57:54,340
Nicholas went on his knees by Smike's bed
and held his hand.

1774
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:58,520
'Oh, you poor boy, he said with tears in his
eyes.

1775
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:01,320
'Of course I forgive you.'

1776
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:07,849
Now, Smike said softly, 'I am happy.'

1777
01:58:07,849 --> 01:58:16,539
He died later that night, quietly, in his
sleep.

1778
01:58:16,539 --> 01:58:19,610
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Ralph's Final Defeat

1779
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:23,840
What good was all his money now?

1780
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,599
He had murdered his own child.

1781
01:58:28,599 --> 01:58:33,039
Ralph sat alone in his room and stared at
his untouched breakfast.

1782
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:36,300
He had a strange feeling that something was
wrong.

1783
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:40,360
It was nearly midday, and Newman Noggs had
still not come to work.

1784
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:45,620
He sent his housekeeper to Noggs s home to
find him.

1785
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:48,449
'He's not there,' she informed him when she
returned.

1786
01:58:48,449 --> 01:58:52,639
'He hasn't been home all night, and no one
knows where he is.

1787
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:56,409
But there's a gentleman waiting for you downstairs.'

1788
01:58:56,409 --> 01:59:01,630
Ralph went downstairs, where Charles Cheeryble
was waiting to speak to him.

1789
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:05,710
Ralph refused to speak to him, and sent him
away at once.

1790
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:09,969
Then he put on his hat and coat and went to
visit Snawley.

1791
01:59:09,969 --> 01:59:13,420
But Snawley's wife angrily refused to let
him see her husband.

1792
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:16,869
'He's in so much trouble because of you!'

1793
01:59:16,869 --> 01:59:19,880
she said, and shut the door in his face.

1794
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:25,860
Next, Ralph went to the Saracen's Head for
news about Squeers, but nobody had seen him

1795
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,479
for ten days.

1796
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:33,560
He decided to visit the house in Lambeth where
Squeers and Peg Sliderskew were staying, but

1797
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:35,600
he found the two rooms empty.

1798
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:41,249
He eventually discovered from a neighbour
that a one-eyed man and a drunken old woman

1799
01:59:41,249 --> 01:59:45,190
had been carried away from the building by
two men the night before.

1800
01:59:45,190 --> 01:59:48,489
'They've been caught by the police,' Ralph
thought.

1801
01:59:48,489 --> 01:59:52,340
'I must tell Arthur Gride at once.'

1802
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:55,269
Arthur Gride, however, did not want to speak
to him.

1803
01:59:55,269 --> 01:59:58,749
'Go away,' he called from an upstairs window.

1804
01:59:58,749 --> 02:00:00,550
'It isn't safe.'

1805
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:06,829
'Come down and open the door,' Ralph demanded,
but without success.

1806
02:00:06,829 --> 02:00:11,289
Gride closed the upstairs window, and there
was silence inside the house.

1807
02:00:11,289 --> 02:00:14,260
'This is mad!'

1808
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:16,190
Ralph said to himself.

1809
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:17,570
'Nobody wants to talk to me.

1810
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:19,170
I must find out what's happening.'

1811
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:24,090
Unwillingly, he decided to visit the Cheeryble
brothers.

1812
02:00:24,090 --> 02:00:27,150
'Which of you visited me this morning?'

1813
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:31,750
Ralph asked, looking from one man to the other,
unable to tell the difference.

1814
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:36,420
'It was my brother,' said brother Ned.

1815
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,789
Without waiting for an invitation, Ralph sat
down and crossed his legs.

1816
02:00:40,789 --> 02:00:44,150
'Now, gentlemen, what do you wish to say?'

1817
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:49,710
Ned rang a bell and Newman Noggs walked into
the room.

1818
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:52,770
'What are you doing here?'

1819
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:56,610
Ralph asked with a scornful smile.

1820
02:00:56,610 --> 02:01:03,239
'I'm here because I hate the cruel way that
you treat honest people,' Noggs replied.

1821
02:01:03,239 --> 02:01:06,300
'You enjoy making innocent people suffer.

1822
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:09,269
I've seen how you've treated your own family.

1823
02:01:09,269 --> 02:01:14,719
I've seen you lie about Smike's father and
persuade a selfish father to sell his daughter

1824
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:16,329
to Arthur Gride.

1825
02:01:16,329 --> 02:01:18,300
I've seen it all.'

1826
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:22,820
'You can't prove any of this,' Ralph said,
still smiling.

1827
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:26,030
'Yes, we can,' brother Charles said.

1828
02:01:26,030 --> 02:01:30,059
'Last night, the man Snawley told us everything.'

1829
02:01:30,059 --> 02:01:33,050
The smile went from Ralph's face.

1830
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:37,829
'Mr Noggs came to us for help a few weeks
ago,' Charles explained.

1831
02:01:37,829 --> 02:01:43,639
'He had been spying on you for a long time,
and had heard all your conversations with

1832
02:01:43,639 --> 02:01:45,889
Snawley, Gride and Squeers.

1833
02:01:45,889 --> 02:01:51,179
We quickly discovered that Snawley was not
Smike's real father.

1834
02:01:51,179 --> 02:01:55,119
He told us that the whole lie had been your
idea.

1835
02:01:55,119 --> 02:02:00,929
Last night, Mr Noggs and my nephew found your
friend Squeers with the stolen papers in his

1836
02:02:00,929 --> 02:02:02,210
pocket.

1837
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:07,280
You were trying to stop Madeline Bray getting
the house that belonged to her, weren't you?

1838
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:11,039
Well, your friend Squeers is already with
the police.'

1839
02:02:11,039 --> 02:02:18,059
'If all this is true, said Ralph, 'why am
I not in prison with him?'

1840
02:02:18,059 --> 02:02:22,210
'We wanted to help you,' brother Ned said.

1841
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:27,320
'We have told you all this before telling
the police about you.

1842
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:31,989
We have given you the chance to leave London.'

1843
02:02:31,989 --> 02:02:33,270
Ralph smiled scornfully.

1844
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:36,510
'I don't believe a word that you say.

1845
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:39,320
I shall not leave London.

1846
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:42,690
You have not heard the last of me!'

1847
02:02:42,690 --> 02:02:46,369
With these proud words, he left the room.

1848
02:02:46,369 --> 02:02:51,940
He went straight to the police station, where
he found Squeers sitting in a prison room.

1849
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,530
What happened last night?'

1850
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:55,650
Ralph asked him.

1851
02:02:55,650 --> 02:03:00,480
Squeers explained everything, his one eye
filled with hate as he spoke.

1852
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,489
'It's all your fault,' the schoolmaster said
angrily.

1853
02:03:04,489 --> 02:03:07,080
'Why didn't you let me burn the papers?

1854
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,499
Now the police have them.

1855
02:03:09,499 --> 02:03:13,260
Madeline Bray will get her house, and my life
is ruined because of you.'

1856
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:17,130
'The police can't do anything,' Ralph said.

1857
02:03:17,130 --> 02:03:19,420
'We'll invent a story, and...

1858
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,400
But Squeers refused to listen.

1859
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,850
'No,' he said.

1860
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:24,219
'I'm finished with you.

1861
02:03:24,219 --> 02:03:28,320
I'm going to tell the police everything.'

1862
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:31,309
Ralph left Squeers and angrily walked home.

1863
02:03:31,309 --> 02:03:37,380
He sat down in the dark, put his head in his
hands and did not move for an hour.

1864
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:41,150
At ten o'clock there was a knock on the door.

1865
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:42,809
It was Tim Linkinwater.

1866
02:03:42,809 --> 02:03:46,869
'Mr Nickleby,' Tim said.

1867
02:03:46,869 --> 02:03:49,300
'Something important has happened.

1868
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:51,600
You must come with me at once.

1869
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,440
'Why should I?

1870
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:56,110
For a repeat performance of this morning?'

1871
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:58,260
'No,' replied Tim.

1872
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,340
'It's bad news for you, I'm afraid.

1873
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,820
You must come.'

1874
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,650
Ralph paused for a moment.

1875
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:08,190
Then he put on his coat and hat and followed
Tim Linkinwater.

1876
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:14,050
'What have you got to tell me?' he said to
the Cheerybles when he arrived.

1877
02:04:14,050 --> 02:04:19,739
'It's about a death,' said brother Charles.

1878
02:04:19,739 --> 02:04:21,909
Ralph's eyes brightened for a second.

1879
02:04:21,909 --> 02:04:24,119
'Is it my nephew?'

1880
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:28,350
'You should be ashamed of yourself!' said
brother Ned.

1881
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:31,599
'You're a hard-hearted, unnatural man.

1882
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:38,440
We are here to tell you about the death of
a poor, innocent boy - a warm-hearted boy

1883
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:42,630
who never knew love, who never did harm to
anybody.

1884
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:48,070
A boy who has died because of you.'

1885
02:04:48,070 --> 02:04:51,119
'Just tell me that my nephew is dead,' Ralph
said.

1886
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:52,880
'That's all I want to hear.'

1887
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:59,139
A figure stepped out of the shadows into the
centre of the room.

1888
02:04:59,139 --> 02:05:00,380
It was Brooker.

1889
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:07,860
'These gentlemen are talking about your only
son,' he said quietly.

1890
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:11,539
Ralph stared in silence as Brooker told his
story.

1891
02:05:11,539 --> 02:05:18,559
'Twenty-five years ago,' he said, 'you secretly
married a girl for her money.

1892
02:05:18,559 --> 02:05:25,120
You had a son, but you sent him away so that
nobody would know about the marriage.

1893
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:29,340
Seven years later, your wife ran away with
another man.

1894
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:32,019
She died soon afterwards.

1895
02:05:32,019 --> 02:05:36,519
Although your wife was dead, you still wanted
revenge.

1896
02:05:36,519 --> 02:05:38,989
'That's when you met me.

1897
02:05:38,989 --> 02:05:42,550
I was a rough, hard-drinking man in those
days.

1898
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:45,199
I had lost all my money.

1899
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:49,119
You wanted me to find your child, and I agreed.

1900
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:53,789
I brought the child home to you, but you weren't
grateful.

1901
02:05:53,789 --> 02:05:57,420
You treated me badly, and I began to hate
you.

1902
02:05:57,420 --> 02:06:00,190
I, too, wanted revenge.

1903
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:06,810
Eight years ago, while you were away on business,
I took your child to a school in Yorkshire

1904
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:10,199
- Dotheboys Hall.

1905
02:06:10,199 --> 02:06:14,380
After your return, I told you that your son
had died.

1906
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:19,889
'A short time later, I was sent abroad on
a prison ship.

1907
02:06:19,889 --> 02:06:24,360
When I returned, I went to Dotheboys Hall
to find the boy.

1908
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:28,360
I heard that he had run away with an assistant
schoolteacher - called Nickleby!

1909
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:32,139
- so I came to London to find you.

1910
02:06:32,139 --> 02:06:38,729
I wanted to tell you about your son, hoping
that you would give me money for the information,

1911
02:06:38,729 --> 02:06:40,679
but you refused to listen.

1912
02:06:40,679 --> 02:06:47,540
I discovered from Newman Noggs that the boy
was very ill and had gone to Devon, so I went

1913
02:06:47,540 --> 02:06:49,909
down there to see him.

1914
02:06:49,909 --> 02:06:56,099
Unfortunately, he saw me watching him from
behind a tree and was frightened.

1915
02:06:56,099 --> 02:07:00,920
When I returned to the farmhouse a few days
later, your nephew told me that the boy was

1916
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,920
dead.

1917
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,159
This is my story.

1918
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:10,600
I've been a bad man, I know, but I want you
to know what you've really done.

1919
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:17,949
You tried to punish your nephew, but you killed
your own child instead.'

1920
02:07:17,949 --> 02:07:21,630
When Brooker finished, there was silence in
the room.

1921
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:27,070
Suddenly, Ralph Nickleby picked up the lamp
and threw it to the floor.

1922
02:07:27,070 --> 02:07:32,050
In the darkness and confusion, he escaped.

1923
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:36,530
As he ran home, there was an unfamiliar feeling
in his heart - pain.

1924
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:43,119
He had always been scornful of people who
suffered from broken hearts - he had always

1925
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:44,979
believed that they were lying.

1926
02:07:44,979 --> 02:07:51,260
Now he knew what such pain felt like, and
it frightened him.

1927
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:56,329
When he reached home, he sat alone in his
room with his head in his hands.

1928
02:07:56,329 --> 02:08:01,219
He had been blinded by his hate for Nicholas,
and had murdered his own child!

1929
02:08:01,219 --> 02:08:04,389
He could not believe it.

1930
02:08:04,389 --> 02:08:10,420
He had tried to destroy the only person in
the world who had shown his son love.

1931
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:13,320
What good was all his money now?

1932
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:16,440
He had murdered his own child.

1933
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:22,019
Interrupted by a loud knocking at the door,
he opened the window and called down into

1934
02:08:22,019 --> 02:08:24,709
the street, 'Who is it?'

1935
02:08:24,709 --> 02:08:31,579
'The twins want to know what to do with Brooker,'
an unknown voice called up from the darkness.

1936
02:08:31,579 --> 02:08:35,269
'Tell them to bring him here tomorrow,' Ralph
replied.

1937
02:08:35,269 --> 02:08:37,699
'Bring my nephew with them.'

1938
02:08:37,699 --> 02:08:39,599
'At what time?'

1939
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,179
'In the afternoon.

1940
02:08:41,179 --> 02:08:45,699
It doesn't matter what time.'

1941
02:08:45,699 --> 02:08:48,309
Ralph closed the window and returned to his
chair.

1942
02:08:48,309 --> 02:08:51,520
A church bell struck one o'clock.

1943
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:53,840
Rain began to fall.

1944
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:56,999
The glass in the window shook in the wind.

1945
02:08:56,999 --> 02:09:02,920
'My nephew was right,' Ralph said quietly
to himself.

1946
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:08,780
'It's the end.'

1947
02:09:08,780 --> 02:09:11,680
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Happiness at Last

1948
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:16,409
Nicholas's happiness was complete.

1949
02:09:16,409 --> 02:09:19,290
He was with all the people that he loved.

1950
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:23,849
All his enemies had been defeated.

1951
02:09:23,849 --> 02:09:28,820
The same evening, Nicholas returned home from
Devon and there was much crying and sadness

1952
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,929
over poor Smike's death.

1953
02:09:30,929 --> 02:09:34,340
Then Kate told him everything about his uncle.

1954
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:41,949
The next day, the Cheeryble brothers, Brooker
and Nicholas arrived at Ralph Nickleby's house.

1955
02:09:41,949 --> 02:09:45,619
Although they knocked loudly on the door,
there was no answer.

1956
02:09:45,619 --> 02:09:50,920
Soon, a large group of neighbours were standing
outside the house.

1957
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:54,019
One man climbed through a window at the back
and let everybody in.

1958
02:09:54,019 --> 02:09:59,360
They searched every room, but there was no
sign of Ralph.

1959
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:02,880
Finally, they reached a room at the top of
the house.

1960
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:06,619
'It's very odd,' one of the neighbours whispered.

1961
02:10:06,619 --> 02:10:10,159
'He's hiding in the dark behind the door.

1962
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:11,599
Look.'

1963
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:13,769
Everyone pressed forwards to see.

1964
02:10:13,769 --> 02:10:18,610
Then one of them pushed the others to one
side and ran in with a loud cry.

1965
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:23,619
He took a knife from his pocket and cut down
the body.

1966
02:10:23,619 --> 02:10:28,920
Ralph had hanged himself.

1967
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:33,739
After a few weeks, the shock of these events
slowly passed into memory.

1968
02:10:33,739 --> 02:10:38,150
Madeline got better and moved in with the
Cheeryble brothers, who treated her like a

1969
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:40,190
daughter.

1970
02:10:40,190 --> 02:10:44,409
Kate was sad to see her friend leave, but
Nicholas was relieved.

1971
02:10:44,409 --> 02:10:47,840
He did not want anyone to know that he was
in love with Madeline.

1972
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:55,559
One day, the Cheerybles invited Nicholas,
Kate, Mrs Nickleby and Miss La Creevy to dinner.

1973
02:10:55,559 --> 02:10:59,390
When they arrived, brother Charles took Kate
by the arm.

1974
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:05,510
'Have you seen Madeline, my dear,' he said,
'since she left your house?'

1975
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:07,719
'No, sir,' Kate replied.

1976
02:11:07,719 --> 02:11:09,120
'Not once.

1977
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,230
I've only received one letter from her.

1978
02:11:11,230 --> 02:11:14,269
I expect that she'll soon forget all about
me.'

1979
02:11:14,269 --> 02:11:20,400
'Well, if you go into that room,' Charles
said, 'there's a letter from her for you on

1980
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,920
the table.'

1981
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:28,070
When Kate had gone, Charles asked Nicholas
to follow him into his private room.

1982
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:31,150
Nicholas was surprised to see Frank Cheeryble.

1983
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:33,989
I thought you'd gone abroad again!'

1984
02:11:33,989 --> 02:11:35,709
Nicholas said.

1985
02:11:35,709 --> 02:11:40,090
Charles watched with a big smile while the
two young men shook hands.

1986
02:11:40,090 --> 02:11:42,300
'I'm glad, he said.

1987
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:46,469
I want you two to be good friends.'

1988
02:11:46,469 --> 02:11:51,010
He then showed Nicholas a copy of Madeline's
grandfather s will.

1989
02:11:51,010 --> 02:11:56,760
Nicholas read until he reached the line: Madeline
Bray will receive a house valued at twelve

1990
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:59,599
thousand pounds when she gets married.

1991
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,400
He did not know what to say.

1992
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,190
Charles turned to Frank.

1993
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:10,140
'My brother and I love Madeline very much.

1994
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:16,050
You saved this will from the fire, and we
would be very happy if you married this girl.

1995
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:17,219
What do you say?'

1996
02:12:17,219 --> 02:12:21,320
'No, I can't,' Frank said.

1997
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:24,229
'She's in love with a man who deserves her
more than me.

1998
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:25,400
I love another woman.'

1999
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:29,199
'Mr Nickleby's sister?'

2000
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:32,320
Charles asked with amusement.

2001
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:38,400
While Frank was trying to think of a reply,
Charles took Nicholas's hand with a warm smile.

2002
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:46,449
'I know that Madeline loves you, Mr Nickleby,
and my brother and I are very happy.

2003
02:12:46,449 --> 02:12:49,920
We are equally happy with Frank's choice of
wife.

2004
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:54,719
Would you, sir, allow him to marry your sister?'

2005
02:12:54,719 --> 02:13:02,229
At that moment, the door opened and brother
Ned came in with Mrs Nickleby, Kate - and

2006
02:13:02,229 --> 02:13:03,229
Madeline!

2007
02:13:03,229 --> 02:13:06,170
'Did you find the letter?'

2008
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:08,429
Charles asked, taking Kate's hand.

2009
02:13:08,429 --> 02:13:12,090
'Or did you find Madeline herself?'

2010
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:18,300
Everybody started laughing, shaking hands,
hugging and kissing each other.

2011
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:22,290
Little Miss La Creevy sat in a window-seat
and cried with happiness.

2012
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:29,070
Tim Linkinwater, who had known Miss La Creevy
for a long time, put his arm around her shoulders.

2013
02:13:29,070 --> 02:13:34,040
When Newman Noggs arrived, Nicholas's happiness
was complete.

2014
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:36,880
He was with all the people that he loved.

2015
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:38,980
All his enemies had been defeated.

2016
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:45,219
Dinner that night was probably one of the
happiest dinners in history!

2017
02:13:45,219 --> 02:13:51,320
Nicholas wanted to share his happiness with
everybody, so a few days later he travelled

2018
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:55,690
to Yorkshire to see John Browdie and his wife,
Tilda.

2019
02:13:55,690 --> 02:13:57,610
They were excited to see him.

2020
02:13:57,610 --> 02:14:03,550
Tilda prepared an enormous breakfast and they
sat around the table in the warm kitchen,

2021
02:14:03,550 --> 02:14:04,550
talking.

2022
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:09,260
Eventually, the conversation turned to the
subject of Squeers.

2023
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:14,349
'They were talking about him in town last
night,' John said.

2024
02:14:14,349 --> 02:14:17,960
'News from London is very slow to reach us
here.

2025
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:21,170
They say that he's been sent to prison for
seven years.

2026
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:22,479
Is that true?'

2027
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:23,479
'Yes.

2028
02:14:23,479 --> 02:14:28,500
He's been sent abroad on a prison ship for
stealing a will.'

2029
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:33,719
John Browdie laughed loudly, hitting the side
of his enormous leg with his hand.

2030
02:14:33,719 --> 02:14:40,260
'If the news has reached Dotheboys Hall, I
wouldn't like to be in the old woman's shoes.

2031
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:42,030
Or Fanny's either!

2032
02:14:42,030 --> 02:14:44,380
Let's go and find out.'

2033
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:46,760
But Nicholas refused.

2034
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:51,469
'I'll only make things worse for them both
if I go, too,' he said.

2035
02:14:51,469 --> 02:14:54,459
'That's true,' John agreed.

2036
02:14:54,459 --> 02:14:59,980
He kissed his wife, shook Nicholas's hand
and rode through the snow to Dotheboys Hall

2037
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:02,119
on his horse.

2038
02:15:02,119 --> 02:15:06,760
When he arrived, he heard a loud noise coming
from inside the school.

2039
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:10,570
The news about Squeers had already reached
Dotheboys Hall!

2040
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:16,370
The boys had locked Mrs Squeers and Fanny
into the classroom and were breaking all the

2041
02:15:16,370 --> 02:15:17,749
furniture.

2042
02:15:17,749 --> 02:15:21,849
They had stolen Mrs Squeers's hat and forced
her to her knees.

2043
02:15:21,849 --> 02:15:26,360
One of the boys was pushing a long wooden
spoon into her mouth.

2044
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:32,239
He was making her take her own 'medicine'
- the horrible thick soup that she usually

2045
02:15:32,239 --> 02:15:34,079
made them eat!

2046
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:40,110
Another boy was pushing young Wackford's head
into the pot of soup.

2047
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:46,039
When John saw other boys attacking Fanny Squeers,
he rushed into the room.

2048
02:15:46,039 --> 02:15:48,630
What's happening here, boys?' he shouted.

2049
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:52,559
'Squeers is in prison, and we're going to
run away!'

2050
02:15:52,559 --> 02:15:53,850
they shouted back.

2051
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:55,320
'We won't stay!

2052
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,500
We won't stay!'

2053
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:59,310
'Well, don't stay, John said.

2054
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:01,370
'But don't hurt the women.'

2055
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:04,010
The boys cheered loudly.

2056
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:06,659
A few minutes later, the school was empty.

2057
02:16:06,659 --> 02:16:08,460
All the boys had run away.

2058
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:13,100
'You'll pay for this, John Browdie!'

2059
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,320
Fanny Squeers said angrily.

2060
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:18,459
'You've helped our boys run away!'

2061
02:16:18,459 --> 02:16:24,010
John looked at her quietly for a minute, then
said, 'I'm glad your father is in prison,

2062
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:25,010
Fanny.

2063
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:27,070
He deserves his punishment.

2064
02:16:27,070 --> 02:16:30,659
But if you need a friend, don't forget Tilda
and me.

2065
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:34,529
We'll be glad to help you if we can.'

2066
02:16:34,529 --> 02:16:38,770
With those words, he hurried back to his wife
and Nicholas.

2067
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:43,630
For the next few days, the countryside was
filled with boys.

2068
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:45,719
John and his wife helped as many as they could.

2069
02:16:45,719 --> 02:16:48,489
They gave them food and money.

2070
02:16:48,489 --> 02:16:52,199
Some boys were found crying under trees in
the snow.

2071
02:16:52,199 --> 02:16:56,519
One poor child was found dead beside the road,
frozen to death.

2072
02:16:56,519 --> 02:17:02,090
But soon, most of the boys had returned to
their families.

2073
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:07,260
Dotheboys Hall became just a dark and painful
memory.

2074
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:12,660
Nicholas and Madeline married a few months
later.

2075
02:17:12,660 --> 02:17:17,210
On the same day, Kate Nickleby became Mrs
Frank Cheeryble.

2076
02:17:17,210 --> 02:17:22,239
Then Miss La Creevy married Tim Linkinwater
in secret.

2077
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:27,559
Nicholas put the money that he received from
Madeline into the Cheeryble brothers' business,

2078
02:17:27,559 --> 02:17:31,309
which became known as 'Cheeryble and Nickleby'.

2079
02:17:31,309 --> 02:17:36,199
The brothers stopped working, and were free
to enjoy the happiness that they had given

2080
02:17:36,199 --> 02:17:39,540
everyone else.

2081
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:45,770
Ralph Nickleby had not left a will, but nobody
wanted to touch his money, so eventually the

2082
02:17:45,770 --> 02:17:48,080
government took it all.

2083
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:53,880
His money, the most important thing in his
life, had made no one happy.

2084
02:17:53,880 --> 02:18:00,189
As soon as he became rich, Nicholas bought
his father's old house in Devon.

2085
02:18:00,189 --> 02:18:04,080
As the years passed, he and Madeline had several
children.

2086
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:07,559
Kate and Frank Cheeryble also had children.

2087
02:18:07,559 --> 02:18:14,070
They moved into a house not far away, and
the two families spent many happy times together.

2088
02:18:14,070 --> 02:18:17,942
Mrs Nickleby sometimes lived with her son,
sometimes with her daughter.

2089
02:18:17,942 --> 02:18:25,170
A quiet, grey-haired gentleman lived in a
little cottage near Nicholas's house.

2090
02:18:25,170 --> 02:18:29,189
His main pleasure in life was playing with
the children.

2091
02:18:29,189 --> 02:18:34,699
The children all loved dear old Newman Noggs.

2092
02:18:34,699 --> 02:18:39,670
Every spring and summer, by the rose-tree
in Nicholas's garden, the children always

2093
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:44,429
made sure that there were fresh flowers on
Smike's grave.

2094
02:18:44,429 --> 02:18:50,889
Although they had never known him, they spoke
about him softly, with tears in their eyes.

2095
02:18:50,889 --> 02:18:55,439
They knew that he had once been their father's
only friend.

2096
02:18:55,439 --> 02:19:00,590
To them, he would always be their much-loved
cousin, Smike.
