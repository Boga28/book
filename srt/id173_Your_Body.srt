Your Skin and Hair

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,920
You have skin everywhere on your body. 
Your skin helps you to touch things.  

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:29,840
It helps you to know when things are hot or 
cold. Skin stops dirt getting into your body.  

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,200
It stops water getting into your body 
when it's rainy and when you swim.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:50,880
Hair grows out of your skin. Hair on your 
arms and legs stands up when you're cold.  

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:02,480
This stops your body getting too cold. 
Your skin makes sweat when you're hot.  

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
This stops your body getting too hot.

9
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:21,360
Protect your body! Wash every day, so you can 
get dirt and sweat off your skin and hair.

Your Bones

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
There are bones under your skin.  

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:44,000
These bones make your skeleton. 
Your skeleton helps you to stand up.

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:59,200
There are joints in your skeleton, too. Bones 
meet at joints. Elbows and knees are joints.  

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Joints help you to move. Knee 
joints help you to jump and kick.

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:24,240
A baby has small bones. Bones grow 
and they make you big and tall.

17
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Your bones stop growing when you are about 20 
years old. Then there are 206 bones in your body!

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,160
Protect your bones! When you ride a skateboard, 
wear pads to protect your bones and joints.  

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000

Your Muscles

22
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,720
What helps your bones and joints to 
walk, run, dance, and jump? Muscles!  

23
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:31,840
Muscles pull your bones to move your body. 
Muscles in your legs help you to ride a bicycle.  

24
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,320
Muscles in your arms help you to row a boat.

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,520
There are more than 600 muscles in your body!

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:59,840
Running, swimming, dancing, and riding 
a bicycle are types of exercise.  

27
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,880

bones, and joints strong.

Your Eyes and Ears

32
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:54,400
Your eyes help you to see the world around you. 
They open and close many times every day. This  

33
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:03,440
is called blinking. When your eyes 
blink, they wash dirt out of your eyes.

34
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,160
At night, your eyes close so you can sleep.

35
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:32,880
Your ears help you to listen to music. They 
help you to listen for cars in the street.  

36
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
Your ears can hear things when you sleep, too!

37
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:51,840

wear sunglasses to protect your eyes.

You breathe through your nose and mouth.  

42
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:27,360
Your nose and mouth take air into your body. 
You breathe about 15 times every minute.

43
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:41,840
After exercise, people breathe fast. 
They can breathe 40 times every minute!

44
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:54,720
Your nose helps you to smell things. 
Your mouth helps you to talk and eat.  

45
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:07,760
Your teeth bite food so you can eat it. 
Your body uses food to live and grow.

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Do you know how you read these words? 
Your brain tells you what your eyes  

51
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:51,600
see! Your brain tells you what you see, hear, 
and touch. It tells your muscles when to move.  

52
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:03,360
It helps you to write, speak, draw, 
and do puzzles. Your brain is amazing!

53
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,840
Your brain works all day 
and at night when you sleep!  

54
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,320
At night, it makes you breathe 
and it makes your heart work.  

55
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,280
At night, your brain helps you to 
remember things that you learn in the day.

Germs can get in your body when

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
Germs can get in your mouth 
from your fingers, too.  

62
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,400
Some germs get in your body 
when you get a cut in your skin.

63
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:25,840
