00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,710
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,440
Let's Do It!

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,670
Jack Griggs stands on his boat.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,160
The wind is strong and his boat moves quickly
over the sea.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,280
A big, white bird goes past and makes a noise.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,570
'Keyaaaa', it cries.

7
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,160
Jack smiles and says: 'Hello, bird.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,300
How are you, today?'

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,409
Jack's friends laugh and give some fish to
the bird.

10
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,420
'Ah,' says Jack.

11
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,820
'Hungry, I see.'

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,900
Jack's friends are Max and Sasha, and his
wife's name is Tonya.

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,810
'I am hungry, too,' says Jack.

14
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,210
'Sandwiches and drinks everybody?

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,880
Tonya.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,360
Can you steer?'

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,820
Half an hour later they are eating.

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:32,050
'What are we going to do now?' asks Jack.

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,620
'Oh, I am going to read my book.

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,160
Then I'm going to sleep,' says Tonya.

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,890
'No - what about tomorrow...?

22
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,810
Next month...?

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,130
Next year?'

24
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,430
Jack looks at everyone.

25
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,180
'We have lots of money from our old business,
but...'

26
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,670
'We can start another business,' says Max.

27
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,220
'A sailing business?' says Sasha.

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,640
'I don't want to work any more,' says Tonya.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,470
'We don't need to work.'

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,599
'OK, listen to me,' says Jack.

31
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,040
'I am thinking about sailing around the world.'

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,590
Max, Tonya and Sasha look at Jack.

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,349
'What?

34
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,260
From here to Australia?' says Tonya.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,819
'Of course,' says Jack.

36
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,540
He is getting very excited now.

37
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,230
'Max, what do you think?'

38
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,670
'I think we must talk about it,' says Max.

39
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,750
They talk for hours.

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:05,340
It is night when Max, Sasha and Tonya say
excitedly: 'OK.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,069
Let's do it!'

42
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,430
They have to do a lot before they leave.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:19,040
Jack talks to a man who knows about sailing
around the world.

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,680
He tells Jack that it is hard work.

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,380
'Does the sea frighten you?

46
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,630
Your boat is very small.

47
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,670
Do you know your friends well?

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,040
Are they good at sailing?' he asks.

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,250
'We know each other well.

50
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,239
They are the best people in the world,' says
Jack.

51
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,959
The four friends look at lots of maps.

52
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,760
Sasha wants to see a whale.

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,489
Max wants to see Africa.

54
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:03,670
'I want to sit in the sun and catch fish to
eat,' laughs Tonya.

55
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,020
It is exciting for all of them.

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,100
And at first everything is easy.

57
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,500
The big day arrives - they are leaving.

58
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,870
Some of their friends and family come to watch.

59
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,060
Their friends stand by the water and say goodbye.

60
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,349
'Good luck,' one of them says.

61
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,020
'Don't forget us!' says Sasha's sister.

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,520
'Write to me every day,' says Tonya's friend.

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,470
'Give the letters to a bird.'

64
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,250
Sasha begins to cry.

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,890
'What are we doing?

66
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,840
Do I really want to go?' she thinks.

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,630
Max takes her hand.

68
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,270
All of them are quiet, excited, and a little
unhappy.

69
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:22,390
'Bye,' says Jack quietly.

70
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,560
CHAPTER TWO
Sailing South

71
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,000
The wind is strong and the boat moves faster
and faster.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,020
Jack, Max, Sasha and Tonya are happy at sea.

73
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,320
There is a lot to do on the boat.

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,669
The wind is behind them and soon they cannot
see England.

75
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,260
They are not unhappy now.

76
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,230
They are sailing south.

77
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,880
In France they stop at L'Orient and Biarritz.

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,640
In Spain, they visit La Coruna, and in Portugal
they stop in Lisbon.

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,520
The sun gets hotter and they feel good.

80
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,560
Sasha catches a big fish and they eat it for
tea.

81
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Soon, they are sailing past Africa.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,920
Here, everything is different.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,740
They stop in Gambia and people look at them.

84
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,479
Small children bring beads and shells and
cloth.

85
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,380
Tonya buys a green hat.

86
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,090
There is a lot of colour and noise and excitement.

87
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,850
They sail for weeks and weeks past Africa.

88
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,400
They stop at many small towns and villages
by the sea.

89
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,820
'Africa is so interesting, so big,' says Sasha.

90
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
'It goes on and on.

91
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,199
I look at it on the map, but...'

92
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,670
'This is why we are here,' says Jack.

93
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,449
'Talking to different people, seeing different
things.

94
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:41,870
The boat, the sea, the wind.

95
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:49,340
Nothing is better than this, is it?'

96
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,070
Some days later they see a big fishing boat.

97
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,300
It is moving very fast.

98
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,639
'Hello!'

99
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,830
they shout at the boat.

100
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,150
The men on the boat look at them angrily.

101
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,490
Max looks carefully at the boat through his
binoculars.

102
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:22,720
'There is something wrong with their fishing
net,' he says.

103
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,030
Max moves the binoculars and sees something
in the sea.

104
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,580
'I can see some net over there.'

105
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,599
He points to their left.

106
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,520
'Why are they leaving it?

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Let's have a look.'

108
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,260
They get nearer to the net and Tonya takes
the binoculars.

109
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,020
'What in the world...' says Tonya.

110
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,810
'What's that?

111
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,800
There is something in the net.

112
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,820
It's alive, but what is it?'

113
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,070
Very slowly they move nearer to the net.

114
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:17,920
The thing in the net is big and it is making
a lot of noise.

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,880
'I can see it now,' says Tonya.

116
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:34,420
'It's an orca - a killer whale - and it's
hurt.

117
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,100
There is blood in the water.

118
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,340
What can we do?

119
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,839
How can we help it?'

120
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,880
'I can see it too.

121
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,740
It is a baby but we must be careful,' says
Max.

122
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,640
Jack is in the water.

123
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,740
He is carrying a long paddle.

124
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,620
'I am going to help it.

125
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,560
I can get the net off its fin,' he says.

126
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,490
'Where's its mother?' asks Sasha.

127
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,649
She looks at the sea.

128
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:25,490
'I can't see any other whales, but they are
near here, I think.

129
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,800
Be careful, Jack.'

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,040
Jack gets the net off the baby killer whale.

131
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,880
There is a big cut on its fin, but it swims
away.

132
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,550
Suddenly there are other killer whales near
the boat.

133
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,240
'Jack!'

134
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,899
Tonya shouts.

135
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,410
'Get in quickly.'

136
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,269
Jack swims to the boat as fast as a fish.

137
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,899
'That baby killer whale...

138
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:21,190
I am going to call it Lucky,' he says.

139
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,330
CHAPTER THREE
The Big Wave

140
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,769
It begins to rain as they move away from the
killer whales.

141
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:42,120
Suddenly it is raining very hard and there
is a lot of wind.

142
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,770
The sky is black.

143
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,980
Jack says: 'This is bad.

144
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,590
We must get away from the wind.

145
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,870
I can see a town over there.

146
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,550
Let's go.'

147
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,670
'I'm frightened,' says Tonya.

148
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,029
It is difficult to hear her because of the
wind.

149
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,890
'We're all frightened,' says Jack.

150
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,730
'But everything is OK.'

151
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:25,110
The town gets nearer but the waves get bigger
and bigger.

152
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,660
Suddenly a very big wave hits the boat.

153
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,000
There is water everywhere.

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,149
'Is everyone OK,' shouts Jack.

155
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,600
'Max?'

156
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,010
'Yes,' says Max.

157
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,460
'Sasha?'

158
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,480
'My arm hurts but I'm OK,' says Sasha.

159
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,890
'Tonya...?

160
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,310
Tonya...?

161
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,350
Where's Tonya?'

162
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,490
shouts Jack.

163
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,490
'She's not in the boat,' says Sasha.

164
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,800
'She's in the water.

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,250
But where?'

166
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,150
They look in the cold, dark water for hours.

167
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,930
'Tonya!

168
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,410
Say something, Tonya.

169
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,529
Where are you?'

170
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,760
shouts Max.

171
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,829
The wind gets stronger and the boat is full
of water.

172
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:37,730
Another big wave hits the boat.

173
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,670
Sasha's arm hurts a lot now.

174
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,880
'Jack, we must stop.

175
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,990
Do you want us all to die?' says Max.

176
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,899
He puts his arm around Jack.

177
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,320
'We can't do any more.

178
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:07,959
Tonya is wearing a lifejacket and she can
swim very well.

179
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:11,930
Let's sail to the town.'

180
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,670
Jack puts his head in his hands.

181
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,990
'This can't happen.

182
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,860
It can't!' he says.

183
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,350
Max begins to steer the boat.

184
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,860
But the wind is too strong.

185
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,670
Some time later the boat hits a beach.

186
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,980
The three friends get out.

187
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,070
They are very tired.

188
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,730
They stop there.

189
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:53,910
Max and Sasha sleep on the beach, but Jack
sits near the water.

190
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:12,320
He looks at the sea, thinking about Tonya.

191
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,010
CHAPTER FOUR
Tonya

192
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,920
Tonya is five hundred metres away out in the
sea.

193
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:34,630
She begins to swim, but the waves are too
big and the water is too cold.

194
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,810
She finds some wood and puts her arms around
it.

195
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,190
Tonya is thinking: 'I must be strong.

196
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,880
I am not going to die.

197
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,740
I want to see the sun again.

198
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,220
Jack is going to find me.'

199
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,519
Tonya sees a boat far away.

200
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,430
She calls to it.

201
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,180
'Help!

202
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,610
Help me!

203
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,260
I'm over here!'

204
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:19,500
She moves her arms and shouts, but nobody
hears her.

205
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,660
The wind moves her away from the boat.

206
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,779
'Oh, Jack.

207
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,430
I'm sorry,' she says.

208
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,540
Her head goes down on to the wood.

209
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,970
In the arms of the sea, she sleeps.

210
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,600
Suddenly Tonya is not sleeping.

211
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,459
There is no wind and she can see the sun.

212
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,760
She looks everywhere.

213
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,440
There is a beach in front of her - but she
cannot swim to it.

214
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,350
'I am too cold and too tired,' she thinks.

215
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,230
'I must see a boat soon.'

216
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,939
She looks at the sea.

217
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:22,779
There are no boats, no people, but some birds.

218
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,129
'Can the birds help me?'

219
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:29,999
she thinks sleepily.

220
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:32,880
Tonya listens to the sea.

221
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,129
She likes the noise.

222
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,700
Then she hears something different.

223
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,690
'Is it a baby crying?'

224
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,490
she thinks and looks up.

225
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:57,650
Ten metres in front of her is a big fin...
a very big fin.

226
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,759
Under the fin is a killer whale.

227
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,940
The whale is making the noise.

228
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:14,970
But it is not a baby - it is five metres long.

229
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,789
Behind it is another whale.

230
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,080
And another.

231
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,830
And another.

232
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,150
'Killer whales eat people.

233
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:33,169
I am going to die,' thinks Tonya.

234
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:39,580
The killer whales come nearer and nearer.

235
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,559
Tonya can't feel her legs.

236
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,330
'It's OK, they are cold.

237
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,690
That's all,' she thinks.

238
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,149
She starts to swim away from the big fins.

239
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:59,210
'Help me!'

240
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,340
she shouts.

241
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,159
'Help, help, help!'

242
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:10,710
The killer whales are all around her.

243
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,690
She closes her eyes and waits.

244
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,510
But she does not die.

245
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,169
The biggest killer whale is under her.

246
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:28,730
Suddenly she is on his back.

247
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,179
'What is happening?

248
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,409
Perhaps they are not hungry.'

249
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,559
Tonya thinks.

250
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,659
The killer whale moves slowly to the shore.

251
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:48,879
He is taking Tonya to the beach.

252
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:53,350
Tonya puts her hands on the fin in front of
her.

253
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,309
'This is a very big fish - too big for my
tea!'

254
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,419
she thinks.

255
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:08,489
She smiles and puts her head on his big back.

256
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:26,440
Soon, she is sleeping again.

257
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,130
CHAPTER FIVE
'Tonya?

258
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,450
Is That You?'

259
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,590
Jack sits on the beach.

260
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,659
The sun is in the sky.

261
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:45,809
Behind him, Max and Sasha sleep.

262
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,889
'I must do something,' he thinks.

263
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:58,220
'I can't take my boat but I must look for
Tonya.'

264
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,549
He begins to walk along the beach.

265
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,669
'There is a town near here.

266
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:12,769
I can get a new boat, then I can look for
Tonya.'

267
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:18,909
Just then Jack sees something on the beach.

268
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,799
He walks nearer.

269
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,190
It is a woman.

270
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,320
Jack runs to the woman on the beach.

271
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,590
'Tonya?' he shouts.

272
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,730
'Tonya!

273
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,029
Is that you?'

274
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,749
Tonya moves her head slowly.

275
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,269
'Jack!

276
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,309
Oh, Jack.

277
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:47,349
You're OK!'

278
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:51,809
Jack puts his arms around Tonya.

279
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,049
He kisses her face and cries.

280
00:21:56,049 --> 00:22:01,950
He can't speak - he is too happy.

281
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,450
Tonya says: 'What about Max and Sasha?

282
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,999
Are they OK, too?'

283
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:15,700
'Everyone is OK,' answers Jack.

284
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,379
They sit on the beach and look at the sea.

285
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:28,119
Jack says: 'We are very, very lucky.'

286
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:34,620
Tonya sits up and sees a small fin in the
water.

287
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,700
It has a cut on it.

288
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,620
The fin waves slowly and moves out to sea.

289
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,380
It is waving goodbye, thinks Tonya.

290
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,190
'Lucky.

291
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,899
Yes, Lucky,' she says quietly to Jack.

292
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:57,299
- THE END -
