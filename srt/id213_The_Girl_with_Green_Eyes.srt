1
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,820
Greg is a porter at the Shepton Hotel in New
York.

2
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,210
After work, he always goes for a coffee across
the street.

3
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,460
A girl is sitting in the coffee shop, near
the window.

4
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,070
'It's her again!'

5
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,600
thinks Greg.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,769
'She's here every afternoon.

7
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:53,929
I'm going to say hello.'

8
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,899
Greg goes into the coffee shop and gets a
coffee.

9
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,229
Then he goes across to the girl's table.

10
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:07,700
'Hi!' he says.

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,160
'I'm Greg.

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,970
Can I sit with you?'

13
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,729
'OK,' she says.

14
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,340
'I'm Cassie.'

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,560
'I come here for a coffee every day after
work,' says Greg.

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,270
'I'm a porter at the Shepton Hotel.'

17
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,610
He smiles.

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,390
'You have beautiful green eyes.'

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,720
'Have I?' she says.

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,180
She doesn't smile.

21
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,009
'Is something wrong, Cassie?' he asks.

22
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,350
'You don't look very happy.'

23
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,350
'It - it's nothing,' she says.

24
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,020
'Tell me,' says Greg.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,230
'Maybe I can help?'

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,130
'Well...' she begins.

27
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,820
'Go on,' says Greg.

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:28,810
'My stepfather is staying at the Shepton Hotel,'
she says.

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,820
'He has my sketch books.

30
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,599
I'm an artist.

31
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,190
When I ask him to give them to me he says,
"No.

32
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,930
I want you to come back home to Boston."

33
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,750
But I don't want to go back to Boston.

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,110
He's not nice.'

35
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:01,299
'How long is he going to be at the hotel?'
asks Greg.

36
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:07,120
'Two more days,' says Cassie.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,370
'He's in room 724.'

38
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,660
'Maybe I can get the sketch books for you,'
says Greg.

39
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,380
'Maybe I can get into his room.'

40
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,959
'Can you?'

41
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,389
she says.

42
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:34,700
'Meet me here tomorrow afternoon at 4.30,'
says Greg.

43
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,410
'OK, thank you!' says Cassie.

44
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,759
'Thank you very much.'

45
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,700
She looks at her watch.

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,780
'I've got to go now.

47
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,900
See you tomorrow.'

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:03,239
When Cassie gets back to her hotel room, she
makes a telephone call.

49
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,140
'Hello,' she says.

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,610
'It's me.

51
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,690
It's OK, the boy's going to do it...

52
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,519
Yes, I'm going to get them from him tomorrow
afternoon...

53
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,780
OK, I can meet you there the morning after,
at 10am.

54
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,900
Don't forget to bring the money - two thousand
dollars.'

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:44,719
Next morning, Greg arrives at work early.

56
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:50,600
He goes to find room 724.

57
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:59,009
'I have to wait for Cassie's stepfather to
go out,' he thinks.

58
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:06,129
'I don't know his name, but it doesn't matter.'

59
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,560
Greg watches the door of room 724.

60
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:20,240
He sees the girl come to clean the rooms.

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,770
Some minutes later, a man comes out of room
724.

62
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,480
'That must be Cassie's stepfather!'

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,000
thinks Greg.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,969
He waits for the man to leave, and for the
cleaning girl to go into room 724.

65
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:54,530
'I need to look in the room,' he thinks.

66
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:05,129
Greg waits for the girl to leave the bedroom,
then he goes into the room and begins to look

67
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,639
for the sketch books.

68
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,099
'I must be quick,' he thinks.

69
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,770
'Where are they?'

70
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,419
Suddenly, Greg sees the sketch books by the
bed.

71
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,529
'Got them!' he thinks.

72
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,350
He begins to look at the pictures.

73
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,150
'Wow!

74
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,029
Cassie is a great artist!

75
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:42,020
These are good!'

76
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:50,330
Greg is leaving the room when he hears the
cleaning girl call out to him.

77
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,099
'Hey!'

78
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,129
she says.

79
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,270
'What are you doing?

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,349
Come back!'

81
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:04,330
Greg does not stop.

82
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:14,689
Greg finishes work that afternoon and leaves
the hotel through a door in the next street.

83
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:23,680
When he gets near the front of the hotel,
he sees the man from room 724.

84
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,669
'That's him again!'

85
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:29,509
thinks Greg.

86
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,900
'That's Cassie's stepfather.'

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:44,099
Greg waits for the man to go into the hotel,
then he goes to the coffee shop.

88
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:51,529
Cassie is at the same table in the coffee
shop.

89
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:57,099
Greg gets a coffee and goes to sit with her.

90
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:05,800
'I have them,' he says, and he puts the sketch
books on the table.

91
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,819
'That's great!'

92
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,340
says Cassie.

93
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,300
'How can I thank you, Greg?'

94
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,520
'You can meet me later,' he says.

95
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,659
'After I go home and change out of my porter's
uniform.'

96
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:31,229
'I'm sorry, Greg,' says Cassie.

97
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,849
'I can't tonight.

98
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,150
Maybe tomorrow night.'

99
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,309
'OK,' says Greg.

100
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,668
'Tomorrow night.

101
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,029
We can get something to eat, first.'

102
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,600
'Yes, OK,' says Cassie.

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,350
'I have to go now, but meet me here tomorrow
evening at six o'clock.'

104
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,900
Cassie gets up, ready to leave.

105
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,320
'Don't forget your key,' says Greg.

106
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,070
'Oh - er - thanks,' says Cassie.

107
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,210
She takes it from him quickly.

108
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,850
'See you tomorrow.'

109
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,910
Greg is finishing his coffee when he sees
his friend, Mike.

110
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,300
'You're in trouble, Greg,' says Mike.

111
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,840
'Jake Russo's sketch books are not in his
room - room 724.

112
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:52,040
And there are CCTV pictures of you coming
from that room.'

113
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,970
'Wh - who is Jake Russo?'

114
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,150
asks Greg.

115
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,540
Suddenly he's not feeling very well.

116
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,620
'An artist,' says Mike.

117
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,290
'His pictures sell for thousands of dollars.

118
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,940
And his sketch books sell for thousands, too.'

119
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,990
'Do you have them?' asks Mike.

120
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:32,030
'No - er - a girl has them,' says Greg.

121
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,200
'What girl?' asks Mike.

122
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,910
'A girl with green eyes,' says Greg.

123
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,020
And he tells Mike about Cassie and her stepfather.

124
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,080
'But it's not true!' says Mike, when Greg
finishes speaking.

125
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,070
'Jake Russo doesn't have a wife or a stepdaughter.

126
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,320
You have to find that girl and get the sketch
books, Greg.

127
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,450
And you have to do it before the police find
you!'

128
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,640
Greg walks home to his one-room apartment.

129
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,930
'How am I going to find her?' he thinks.

130
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:35,380
'She has Jake Russo's sketch books now, so
she's not going to meet me again.

131
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,990
Is she going to sell them for a lot of money?'

132
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:50,110
There is a police car in the street, next
to Greg's apartment.

133
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,350
'Oh, no!' he thinks.

134
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,190
'They're waiting for me.

135
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,240
I can't get into my apartment now.'

136
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:12,370
That night, Greg sleeps on a train in the
subway.

137
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,020
But early the next morning...

138
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,560
'Hey, you!' says a man.

139
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,090
He's the subway cleaner.

140
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,620
'Get up!

141
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,940
You can't sleep here all day!'

142
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,300
'Sorry,' says Greg.

143
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:41,860
People are arriving to get their trains now.

144
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:51,770
One of them stops and looks at a photograph
in his newspaper - and then at Greg.

145
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,700
'It's him,' thinks the man.

146
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,460
'It's the young man in the newspaper photograph.

147
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,370
The police are looking for him.'

148
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:16,030
Suddenly, Greg sees the man looking at him.

149
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,590
And he sees his picture on the front of the
man's newspaper.

150
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,900
'I have to get out of here quickly!' he thinks.

151
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,110
The man with the newspaper finds a policeman.

152
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:41,330
'It's him!' he tells the policeman.

153
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,450
'The hotel porter!'

154
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,200
'Hey, you!'

155
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,260
the policeman calls to Greg.

156
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,550
Greg runs.

157
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,320
'Stop!'

158
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,160
calls the policeman.

159
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,370
Greg doesn't stop.

160
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:13,860
'I have to get out of this uniform,' thinks
Greg.

161
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,200
'People know I'm the porter.

162
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,030
Maybe Mike can give me something different
to wear.'

163
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,700
When he gets to Mike's apartment, Mike opens
the door.

164
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,850
'I need something to wear,' Greg tells him.

165
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,730
'I can't go back to my apartment.

166
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,930
My picture's in the newspaper, and -'

167
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:52,680
'Yes, I know,' says Mike.

168
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,210
'It's OK.

169
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,260
Come in.'

170
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,060
'Where's the girl?' asks Mike.

171
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,890
'Do you know?'

172
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,010
'No,' says Greg.

173
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,620
'What can you remember about her?' says Mike.

174
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,450
'There must be something to help you find
her.'

175
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,240
'Yes!'

176
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,910
Greg says, suddenly.

177
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,090
'Her key!

178
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:33,010
A key to a room in the Dolphin Hotel!

179
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:40,720
It's a small, cheap hotel near 42nd Street.

180
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,090
She must be staying there.

181
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,050
What's the time?'

182
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,930
'Nearly nine o'clock,' says Mike.

183
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,190
'Maybe she's there now,' says Greg.

184
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,870
'I have to go!

185
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,010
Thanks, Mike.'

186
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:13,240
Twenty minutes later, Greg is near the Dolphin
Hotel.

187
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,170
'Am I too late?' he thinks.

188
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:26,420
Suddenly, Greg sees Cassie come out of the
hotel.

189
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,990
'Cassie!' he calls.

190
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,850
'Wait!

191
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,630
I have to talk to you!'

192
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,690
Cassie sees him, but she doesn't stop.

193
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,820
There is a car waiting for her.

194
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,270
She says something to the driver and gets
into it quickly.

195
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,980
'Oh, no!' says Greg.

196
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:12,020
'Pier 83,' says an old man in the street.

197
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,980
Greg looks at him.

198
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,429
'What?'

199
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:36,950
'The girl is going to Pier 83, West 42nd Street,
for the Circle Line boat,' says the old man.

200
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,440
Greg smiles.

201
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,750
'Thanks!' he says.

202
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,140
And he begins to run.

203
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:57,049
Greg runs all the way to Pier 83.

204
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:06,170
People are getting on to the boat, and he
gets a ticket.

205
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,139
On the boat, Greg looks for Cassie.

206
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:17,899
But a woman with a newspaper is looking at
him.

207
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,440
'It's the young man in the picture!'

208
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,210
she tells the man with her.

209
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,999
'Call the police, Eddie.'

210
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:37,059
The man gets his phone and calls the police.

211
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:42,929
Some time later, Greg sees Cassie.

212
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:47,110
She is talking to a man.

213
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:55,120
But Greg does not see two policemen get on
the boat.

214
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,039
They quickly find Greg.

215
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,809
'Where are Jake Russo's sketch books?'

216
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,240
the first policeman asks him.

217
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,600
'I don't have them!' says Greg.

218
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,879
'You don't want me!

219
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:19,090
You want her!

220
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,320
She has the sketch books.'

221
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,610
'Hey, look!

222
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:32,590
He's right,' says the second policeman.

223
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:41,159
The two policemen move quickly to Cassie and
the man.

224
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,480
'I don't understand,' says Cassie.

225
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
'How...?'

226
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:55,549
'The two of you are coming with us,' says
one of the policemen.

227
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,990
'You're in trouble.'

228
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:09,210
Later, Greg and a policeman take the sketch
books back to the hotel.

229
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,210
Jake Russo is very happy to see them again.

230
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:25,980
'I'm sorry, Mr Russo,' says Greg, and tells
him everything.

231
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,600
'It's OK,' says the artist, smiling.

232
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,309
'But stay away from girls with beautiful green
eyes!'
