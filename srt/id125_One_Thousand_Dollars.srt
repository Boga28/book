1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,230
One Thousand Dollars
"One thousand dollars," repeated Lawyer Tolman.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,160
"And here is the money."

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,280
His voice was formal and distant.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,790
Young Gillian laughed as he touched the small
package of money.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,470
"It's such an awkward amount," he said to
the lawyer.

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,090
"With ten thousand dollars you can really
have fun.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,279
Even fifty dollars are less of a problem."

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,480
"You heard your uncle's will," continued Lawyer
Tolman.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
"Did you listen carefully?

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,780
Remember that you must tell us exactly HOW
you spend the $1,000, as soon as you spend

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,780
it.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,520
It is best that you write a list for us.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,750
These were Mr Gillian's last wishes."

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,210
"Of course I will," said the young man politely.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,750
"Perhaps I'll need a secretary to help me
write the list."

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,570
Gillian put the small package of money into
his coat pocket and went to his club.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,570
At his club he looked for Old Bryson, who
was forty years old and calm.

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,769
He was reading a book and took off his glasses
when he saw Gillian.

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,690
"Wake up, Old Bryson," said Gillian.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,890
"I have a funny story to tell you."

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,390
"Why don't you tell it to someone else," said
Old Bryson.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,740
"You know I hate your stories."

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,940
"This one is better than usual," said Gillian.

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,330
"It's sad and funny.

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,420
My uncle left me one thousand dollars in his
will.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,549
Now what can a man do with a thousand dollars?"

27
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:32,700
"I thought your uncle was a very rich man
with about half a million dollars," said Old

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,190
Bryson, showing very little interest.

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,600
"He was," said Gilllian happily.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,560
"That's why it's so funny.

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,200
He left one part of his money to the scientist
who will discover a new germ.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,130
And the other part to build a hospital that
will destroy the germ!

33
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,520
Then the butler and the housekeeper got a
special ring and $10 each.

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,820
And I got $1,000."

35
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,220
"You have plenty of money to spend," said
Old Bryson.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,010
"Oh yes, plenty," said Gilllian.

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,189
"My uncle was very generous with me."

38
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,270
"Are there any other heirs?"

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,619
asked Old Bryson.

40
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,189
"None, except for Miss Hayden, a ward of my
uncle who lived in his house.

41
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,239
She's a quiet girl, the daughter of one of
his friends.

42
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,519
Now tell me, Old Bryson, what can a man do
with a thousand dollars."

43
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,980
Old Bryson cleaned his glasses and smiled.

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,239
Gillian knew that when Old Bryson smiled he
was going to be very offensive.

45
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,939
"A thousand dollars can be a lot of money
or very little money," he said.

46
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,260
"A man can buy a home with it and be very
happy.

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,209
You can buy milk for one hundred babies for
three months and save their lives.

48
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,659
It can give an ambitious boy an education.

49
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:50,150
A man can buy a real Corot painting, You can
also live well in a New Hampshire town for

50
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,150
two years.

51
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,269
But you, Bobby Gillian, can do only one thing.

52
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,499
You can buy Miss Lotta Lauriere a diamond
pendant with the thousand dollars."

53
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,340
"Thanks," said Gillian.

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,889
"I knew you could solve the problem."

55
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,029
Gillian phoned for a taxi.

56
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:11,510
He said to the driver, "Please take me to
the Columbine Theater."

57
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,699
Miss Lotta Lauriere was getting ready for
her performance.

58
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,590
When she saw Gillian she said, "What is it,
Bobby?

59
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,489
I have a performance in two minutes."

60
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,920
"This won't take two minutes.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,109
Would you like a little pendant?

62
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,699
I can spend a thousand dollars on it."

63
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,909
"Oh, all right," said Miss Lauriere.

64
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,519
"Where is my hat?

65
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,049
Bobby, did you see the necklace Della Stacey
was wearing the other night?

66
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,319
It cost two thousand two hundred dollars at
Tiffany's but, all right..."

67
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,639
"Miss Lauriere, you're on stage in a minute!"

68
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,189
cried the manager of the theater.

69
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,140
Gillian returned to his taxi.

70
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,329
"What can a man do with one thousand dollars?"
he asked the driver.

71
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,299
"Open a saloon," said the driver immediately.

72
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,189
"I know a perfect place for a saloon, where
I could make lots of money and..."

73
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,989
"Please drive until I tell you to stop," said
Gillian.

74
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,029
They drove down Broadway and Gillian saw a
blind man on the sidewalk.

75
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:15,450
He was sitting on a chair and selling pencils,
Gillian got out of the taxi and stood in front

76
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,500
of him.

77
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,910
"Excuse me," he said.

78
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,989
"But what can you do with a thousand dollars?"

79
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,670
"You just got out of the taxi, didn't you?"
asked the blind man.

80
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,790
"Yes, I did," said Gillian.

81
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,440
"I think you're a gentleman, if you ride a
taxi during the day.

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,350
Take a look at this, please."

83
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,811
He took a small book from his coat pocket
and gave it to Gillian.

84
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:43,680
Gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank
deposit book.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,220
It showed a sum of $1,785.

86
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,280
Gillian returned the bank deposit book and
got into the cab.

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,810
"I forgot something," he said.

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,730
"Drive to the law offices of Tolman and Sharp."

89
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,910
Lawyer Tolman looked at him severely through
his glasses.

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,970
"Excuse me," said Gillian cheerfully.

91
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,560
"May I ask you a question?

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,540
Did my uncle leave Miss Hayden anything besides
the ring and the ten dollars?"

93
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,620
"Nothing," said Mr Tolman.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,500
"Thank you very much, sir," said Gillian and
he returned to his taxi.

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,860
He gave the driver the address of his late
uncle's home.

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,020
Miss Hayden was writing letters in the library.

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
She was small and thin, and she wore black
clothes.

98
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,670
But she had lovely eyes.

99
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,920
Gillian entered and said, "I was at the lawyer's
office and he found an additional clause to

100
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,530
my uncle's will.

101
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,880
It seems that he left you one thousand dollars.

102
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,980
Mr Tolman asked me to bring you this money.

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,880
Here it is.

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,200
Please count it to see if it's right.

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,780
Gillian put the money near her hand on the
desk.

106
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,540
Miss Hayden's face turned white, "Oh!"

107
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,290
she said and again, "Oh!"

108
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,700
Gillian turned and looked out of the window.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,290
"I think you know that I love you," Gillian
said.

110
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,170
"I am sorry," said Miss Hayden, taking her
money.

111
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,290
"Then, there is no hope?" asked Gillian.

112
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,480
"I am sorry," she said again.

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,080
"May I write a note?" asked Gillian with a
smile.

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,270
He sat down at the big library table.

115
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,420
She gave him some paper and a pen.

116
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,640
Gillian wrote:

117
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:36,800
Paid by Robert Gillian, $1,000 to the best
and dearest woman in the world, for all the

118
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,470
happiness she brings to people.

119
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,730
Gillian put his note into an envelope and
went away.

120
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,280
His taxi stopped again at the law offices
of Tolman and Sharp.

121
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,510
"I spent the thousand dollars," he said happily,
"and I am here to tell you exactly how I spent

122
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,510
them."

123
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,300
He threw the white envelope on the lawyer's
table.

124
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:06,590
Mr Tolman did not touch the envelope and went
to a door and called his partner, Mr Sharp.

125
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,950
Together they opened the big safe.

126
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,520
They took out a large envelope and slowly
opened it.

127
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,240
"Mr Gillian," Mr Tolman said formally, "there
is a codicil to your uncle's will.

128
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,540
He gave it to us privately.

129
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,730
It can be opened only after you spend the
thousand dollars.

130
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,930
This is what it says:

131
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,690
Dear Robert,

132
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:37,490
Spend the thousand dollars wisely and carefully
and you will receive $50,000 in bonds.

133
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,680
Spend the money carelessly and foolishly,
as you did in the past, and the $50,000 in

134
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,300
bonds will go to Miriam Hayden, my ward.

135
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,870
Your uncle, Septimas Gillian

136
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,980
"Now, Mr Sharp and I will examine your note
and then decide."

137
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,550
Mr Tolman put out his hand to take the note,
but Gillian was quicker.

138
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,750
He took it and tore it into little pieces
and put them in his pocket.

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,280
"Oh, it's all right," he said smiling.

140
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,150
"I don't want to disturb you with this.

141
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,560
I lost the thousand dollars at the horse races.

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,300
Good day to you, gentlemen."

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,810
Tolman and Sharp looked at each other and
shook their heads.

144
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,300
Gillian left and whistled happily as he waited
for the elevator.

145
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,740
- THE END -
