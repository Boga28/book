1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,960
The woods were already filled with shadows
one June evening, just before eight o'clock,

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,080
although a bright sun, low in the west, still
shone through the trees.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,660
A little girl was driving home her cow, a
slow-moving, annoying creature, but also a

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,250
good companion among the shadowy trees.

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,730
Their way home was deep in the woods, but
their feet knew the path very well, so the

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,040
darkness did not matter.

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,300
It often took a long time to find the cow
before Sylvia could bring her home.

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,070
The cow seemed to enjoy hiding among the bushes.

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,270
She wore a loud bell around her neck, but
the clever creature had discovered that the

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,110
bell did not ring if she stood very still.

11
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:12,050
Luckily, the cow gave good milk and lots of
it, so her owners did not mind about her hiding.

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,360
And Sylvia had all the time in the world,
and very little to do in that time except

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,220
chase the cow.

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:30,970
The cow had now decided she wanted to go home,
and stepped along the path more quickly.

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:37,550
Sylvia wondered what her grandmother would
say, because they were very late.

16
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:44,189
It was a long time since she had left home
at half-past five.

17
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:51,329
But Mrs Tilley had chased the cow herself
on many summer evenings and knew how difficult

18
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,960
the old cow could be.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,870
She also knew that Sylvia loved being outside
in the woods and fields.

20
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,360
It was a great change for a little girl who
had lived for eight years in a crowded noisy

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,090
town full of factories.

22
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,450
Old Mrs Tilley had chosen Sylvia from her
daughter's houseful of children, to come and

23
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,540
live with her at the farm.

24
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:30,400
Sylvia was 'afraid of people', her mother
said, but Mrs Tilley just laughed.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,519
'I guess she won't be troubled much with people
up at the old place!'

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,980
So the old grandmother took Sylvia away.

27
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,530
And when at last they reached the door of
the lonely farmhouse, and the cat came to

28
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,409
walk around their legs purring loudly, Sylvia
whispered that this was a beautiful place

29
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,590
to live in, and she would never wish to go
home.

30
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,180
That was a year ago, and now the girl and
the cow followed the shadowy path through

31
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,140
the woods.

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:16,470
The cow stopped to drink in a little river,
and Sylvia stood still and waited, letting

33
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,030
her feet cool themselves in the shallow water.

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:30,019
Up above her, in the great branches of the
tall trees, the leaves moved gently in a little

35
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,950
wind, and the birds were singing, preparing
for the night.

36
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:44,409
Sylvia herself felt sleepy, but it was not
far to the house now, and the air was soft

37
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,319
and sweet.

38
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,490
She felt that she belonged in this quiet world
of gray shadows and moving leaves, and her

39
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,989
life in the noisy town seemed far away.

40
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,360
Suddenly the little woods-girl heard a clear
whistle not far away.

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,930
Not a bird's whistle, which is a friendly
sound, but a boy's whistle - loud and strong

42
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,650
and full of fight.

43
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,910
Frightened, Sylvia tried to hide behind some
bushes, but she was just too late.

44
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,550
The enemy had discovered her, and called out
in a friendly voice, 'Hallo, little girl,

45
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,690
how far is it to the road?'

46
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,729
'A good long way,' answered Sylvia in a frightened
little whisper.

47
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,210
She was not brave enough to look at the tall
young man, who carried a gun over his shoulder,

48
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,770
but she came out from behind her bush and
again followed the cow.

49
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,500
The young man walked along beside her.

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:04,139
'I have been hunting for some birds,' the
stranger said, 'and I have lost my way, and

51
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,490
need a friend very much.

52
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,860
Don't be afraid,' he added gently.

53
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,290
'Speak up, and tell me what your name is.

54
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:21,419
And do you think I can spend the night at
your house, and go out hunting early in the

55
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,120
morning?'

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,230
Sylvia was more frightened than ever.

57
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,229
What would her grandmother say about this?

58
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,420
She did not know what to do and looked down
at the ground.

59
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:47,889
In the end she managed to whisper, 'Sylvy',
when the young man again asked her name.

60
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,139
Mrs Tilley was at the door when the three
companions arrived.

61
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,479
The cow gave a loud moo to explain matters.

62
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,930
'Yes, you ought to be sorry!'

63
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,970
Mrs Tilley said to the cow.

64
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,380
'Where was she hidin' herself this time, Sylvy?'

65
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,220
But Sylvia kept silent, not knowing how to
explain the stranger.

66
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,789
The young man put his gun by the door, and
dropped his hunting bag next to it.

67
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:29,669
He said good evening to Mrs Tilley, told his
story, and asked for a night's rest at the

68
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:32,300
farm.

69
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,080
'Put me anywhere you like,' he said.

70
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,800
'I must be off early in the morning, before
day; but I am very hungry indeed.

71
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,050
You can give me some milk, that's clear.'

72
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,300
'Oh yes, we can give you milk,' said Mrs Tilley.

73
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,509
'And you're welcome to what we've got.

74
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,919
I'll milk the cow right now, an' you make
yourself at home.

75
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:05,010
There's plenty o' comfortable places to sleep
round the farm,' she added kindly.

76
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,889
'Now step round an' put out a plate for the
gentleman, Sylvy!'

77
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:17,680
Sylvia disappeared at once, pleased to have
something to do, and she was hungry herself.

78
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,009
The young man was surprised to find this clean
and comfortable little house in the New England

79
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,789
wilderness.

80
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:32,139
He had stayed in very different kinds of homes,
where the chickens lived in the same room

81
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,740
as the family.

82
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,319
He listened with interest to the old woman
talking, he watched Sylvia's pale face and

83
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:50,169
shining gray eyes, and he said it was the
best supper that he had eaten in a month.

84
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:57,700
Afterward, the new friends sat in the doorway
together while the moon came up.

85
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,639
'I've buried four children,' Mrs Tilley told
the young man.

86
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,360
'Sylvy's mother and one son are all the children
that I have now.

87
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,289
Dan, my boy, was a great hunter, he was always
out in the woods.

88
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:22,780
Sylvy is like him, she knows all the woods
an' fields, every tree an' bush.

89
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,540
The wild creatures think she's one o' them.

90
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,519
The squirrels will come and eat right out
o' her hands, and all kinds o' birds.

91
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,680
She knows all o' them.

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,180
Just like Dan.

93
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,330
He's been gone for years,' she said sadly.

94
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,990
'Dan an' his father, they didn't get along.'

95
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,380
There was some family sadness hidden in those
words, but the young man did not hear it;

96
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,070
he was too interested in something else.

97
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,790
'So Sylvy knows all about birds, does she?'
he said.

98
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:12,170
He looked round at the little girl who sat,
shy and sleepy, in the moonlight.

99
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,779
'I've been collecting birds myself, ever since
I was a boy.'

100
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,360
(Mrs Tilley smiled.)

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,339
'But there are two or three unusual ones that
I haven't found yet.'

102
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,760
'Do you put them in cages?'

103
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,370
asked Mrs Tilley.

104
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,290
'Oh no, they're stuffed.

105
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,860
And I've shot or caught every one myself.

106
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,310
I saw a white heron two days ago, and I've
been following it.

107
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,650
The little white heron, it is,' and he turned
to look at Sylvia, hoping that she had seen

108
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,650
it.

109
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:56,680
'A strange tall white bird with soft feathers
and long thin legs.

110
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Its nest is made of sticks, often in the top
of a high tree.'

111
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,420
Sylvia's heart gave a wild beat.

112
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,700
She knew that strange white bird, and had
once got close to where it stood in the green

113
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,640
marsh grass, over at the other side of the
woods.

114
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,680
'I'd like to find that heron's nest more than
anything,' the young man said.

115
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,190
'I'd give ten dollars to anybody who could
show it to me,' he added, 'and I plan to spend

116
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,860
the rest of my vacation hunting for it.'

117
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:41,820
Mrs Tilley listened to all this with amused
interest, but Sylvia was watching the moonlight

118
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,350
dancing in the trees.

119
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,920
It was impossible to decide, during that night,
how many wonderful things those ten dollars

120
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,070
could buy.

121
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,070
***

122
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,640
The next day the young hunter walked around
the woods, and Sylvia went with him.

123
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,620
She had lost her fear of the young man, who
was friendly and kind.

124
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,350
He told her many things about the birds and
where they lived and what they did.

125
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:21,220
And he gave her a pocket-knife, which was
a wonderful thing to her.

126
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,579
She liked him very much indeed, but she did
not like the shooting.

127
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:34,690
She could not understand why he killed the
birds that he seemed to love so much.

128
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:42,269
But as the day passed, Sylvia still watched
the young man, and the woman's heart, asleep

129
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:49,010
in the child, slowly began to learn the dream
of love.

130
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,850
Together they stepped softly through the woodlands.

131
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,709
They stopped to listen to a bird's song, then
went forward, carefully moving branches to

132
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,880
one side.

133
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,750
They spoke little, and only in whispers; the
young man going first and Sylvia following,

134
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,880
with her gray eyes dark with excitement.

135
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,450
She was sad because they did not find the
white heron, the bird that the young man wanted

136
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,620
so much.

137
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,630
But Sylvia only followed where he went; she
could never speak first.

138
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,880
It was hard enough for her to whisper 'yes'
or 'no' to answer questions.

139
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,890
At last evening came, and they found and drove
the cow home together.

140
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,310
And Sylvia smiled happily when they came to
the place where she heard the whistle and

141
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,569
was afraid only the night before.

142
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,569
***

143
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:05,930
Half a mile from home, at the far edge of
the woods, on high ground, a great pine-tree

144
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,250
stood.

145
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:16,350
It was the last tree of an older forest, and
around it a new wood of younger trees had

146
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,389
grown.

147
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:25,430
But the old pine-tree's head stood high above
them all, and was seen from miles away across

148
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,800
land and sea.

149
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,320
Sylvia knew this tree well.

150
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,050
She believed that at the top it was possible
to see the Atlantic Ocean.

151
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:44,899
The little girl had never seen the sea, but
she had often dreamed about it.

152
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:51,449
Now, she had a new idea, which filled her
with excitement.

153
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:56,360
From the top of this great tree she could
see all the world.

154
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,680
So couldn't she also see where the white heron
flew, where it came from, and where it went

155
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,290
to?

156
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,130
She would see where it flew into the trees,
and she would remember the place, and find

157
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,759
the hidden nest.

158
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,170
What an adventure it would be!

159
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,130
And how wonderful, later in the morning, when
she could tell her great secret!

160
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:28,540
The young hunter and the old grandmother slept
deeply that night, but Sylvia lay awake, waiting

161
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,680
for the short summer night to pass, and her
great adventure to begin.

162
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,350
Before daylight, she quietly left the house
and followed the path through the woods.

163
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,850
The birds were making their first sleepy little
calls, but Sylvia was thinking only about

164
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,860
the great change that had come into her dull
little life.

165
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:03,300
Ah, Sylvy, Sylvy, do not forget that the birds
and animals of the forest were your first

166
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,480
friends!

167
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,560
Now she came to the great pine-tree, and small
and foolish Sylvia began to climb.

168
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,440
First, she must climb the white oak tree next
to the pine-tree.

169
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,389
She had often climbed this tree, and knew
that one of its high branches went into the

170
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,019
pine-tree, and she could move from one tree
to the other.

171
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:35,079
She made that dangerous crossing safely, and
now began to climb the pine-tree itself, using

172
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,460
all her fingers and toes to hold on.

173
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,280
The way was harder than she thought; she must
reach far and hold fast.

174
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,509
A red squirrel, coming down the tree, stopped
in great surprise when it saw her, and then

175
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,730
ran away along a branch.

176
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,550
Bravely, she climbed upward.

177
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,640
Light was just appearing in the eastern sky,
and the small song-birds began to sing their

178
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,360
welcome to the new day.

179
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,870
Higher and higher Sylvia climbed.

180
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,070
Her fingers ached from holding on, and the
roughness of the branches hurt her feet.

181
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,320
But on she went.

182
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,460
Perhaps the old pine-tree welcomed this stranger
among its branches, and loved the brave, beating

183
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,990
heart of the gray-eyed child.

184
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:37,210
At last, Sylvia's face appeared like a pale
star, and she stood, tired and aching, but

185
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,080
bright with victory, high in the tree-top.

186
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:49,399
Yes, there was the sea in the east, with the
sun making a golden path across it.

187
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:56,040
And in the west, the woods and farms, the
green fields and white villages, reached miles

188
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,700
into the distance.

189
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Truly, it was a great and beautiful world.

190
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,390
The birds sang louder and louder, and the
sun grew brighter.

191
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,580
Sylvia could see the white sails of ships
out at sea, and the purple-pink clouds began

192
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,020
to turn white.

193
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:23,400
Where was the white heron's nest in this sea
of green branches?

194
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,280
Now look down, Sylvy, to where the green marsh
lies between the trees.

195
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,100
There, where you saw the white heron once,
you will see him again.

196
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,059
Look, look!

197
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:43,549
Something white is flying upward from the
dead hemlock-tree by the green marsh.

198
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:50,900
It comes higher and higher, and flies past
the great pine-tree, its white wings beating

199
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,890
slowly.

200
00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:00,500
Now it lands on a branch nearby, and cries
back to his mate on the nest below and cleans

201
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,440
his feathers for the new day.

202
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,890
The child watches, her heart full of happiness.

203
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,809
She knows the wild white heron's secret now.

204
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:20,660
In a minute he flies away, back down to his
home in the green world below.

205
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,390
Then Sylvia begins the dangerous climb down,
careful not to look down, and ready to cry

206
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,400
sometimes because her fingers ache and her
feet hurt.

207
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,790
But she wonders over and over again what the
young man will say to her when she tells him

208
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,900
how to find his way straight to the heron's
nest.

209
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,400
'Sylvy, Sylvy!'

210
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,780
called the busy old grandmother again and
again, but Sylvia's small bed was empty.

211
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:57,700
The visitor woke up, and hurried to get ready
for his day in the woods.

212
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:04,570
He was sure from the shy little girl's face
that she knew where the white heron was.

213
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:12,310
Here she is now, paler than ever, her dress
dirty from the pine-tree.

214
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,710
The grandmother and the hunter stand at the
door together and question her, and the great

215
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,610
moment has come to speak of the dead hemlock-tree
by the green marsh.

216
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:29,140
But Sylvia does not speak after all, although
the young man's kind eyes are looking straight

217
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,780
into her own.

218
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:38,670
He can make them rich with money; he has promised
it, and they are poor now.

219
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:45,710
She wants so much to make him happy, and he
waits to hear the story that she can tell.

220
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,750
No, she must keep silent!

221
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,309
Why, suddenly, is it forbidden to speak?

222
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:58,320
It is the first time in her young life that
the great world has put out a hand to her

223
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,650
- and must she push it away, because of a
bird?

224
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,390
The sound of the great pine-tree's branches
is in her ears, she remembers how the white

225
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:16,030
heron came flying through the golden air and
how they watched the sea and the morning together,

226
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:24,080
and Sylvia cannot speak; she cannot tell the
heron's secret and give its life away.

227
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
***

228
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,200
The pain in that loyal heart was great when
the young man went away disappointed later

229
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,309
in the day.

230
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,600
The promise and the dream of love had gone
for ever.

231
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,650
For a long time she heard again his whistle
as she came home with the cow, and she even

232
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:50,640
forgot her sadness at the sound of his gun
and the song-birds falling silent to the ground.

233
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,250
Were the birds better friends than their hunter
- who can tell?

234
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:05,600
But remember, you wild creatures of the woodland,
what this child has lost!

235
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,870
Bring your love and trust and tell your secrets
to this lonely country child!
