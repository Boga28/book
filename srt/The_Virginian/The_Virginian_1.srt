THE VIRGINIAN

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,040
by Owen WISTER

3
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
CHAPTER I

4
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,920
Enter the Man

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:15,880
Some notable sight was drawing the passengers, both men and women, to
the window; and therefore I rose and crossed the car to see what it was.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:27,120
I saw near the track an enclosure, and round it some laughing men, and inside it
some whirling dust, and amid the dust some horses, plunging, huddling, and dodging.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,280
They were cow ponies in a corral, and one of them would not be
caught, no matter who threw the rope.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:43,600
We had plenty of time to watch this sport, for our train had stopped that the engine might
take water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform of Medicine Bow.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,240
We were also six hours late, and starving for entertainment.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,400
The pony in the corral was wise, and rapid of limb.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,320
Have you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet,
incessant eye?

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,520
Such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took
the rope.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,960
The man might pretend to look at the weather, which was fine; or he
might affect earnest conversation with a bystander: it was bootless.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
The pony saw through it.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,400
No feint hoodwinked him.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,800
This animal was thoroughly a man of the world.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,520
His undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissembling foe, and the
gravity of his horse-expression made the matter one of high comedy.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,360
Then the rope would sail out at him, but he was already elsewhere;
and if horses laugh, gaiety must have abounded in that corral.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:50,200
Sometimes the pony took a turn alone; next he had slid in a flash among his brothers, and the whole of them like a
school of playful fish whipped round the corral, kicking up the fine dust, and (I take it) roaring with laughter.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:59,840
Through the window-glass of our Pullman the thud of their mischievous
hoofs reached us, and the strong, humorous curses of the cowboys.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Then for the first time I noticed a man who sat on the high gate
of the corral, looking on.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,480
For he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger, smooth
and easy, as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,800
The others had all visibly whirled the rope, some of them even
shoulder high.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
I did not see his arm lift or move.

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,800
He appeared to hold the rope down low, by his leg.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,160
But like a sudden snake I saw the noose go out its length and
fall true; and the thing was done.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:45,600
As the captured pony walked in with a sweet, church-door expression, our train moved
slowly on to the station, and a passenger remarked, “That man knows his business.”

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:54,400
But the passenger’s dissertation upon roping I was obliged to
lose, for Medicine Bow was my station.

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,160
I bade my fellow-travellers goodbye, and descended, a stranger,
into the great cattle land.

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,920
And here in less than ten minutes I learned news which made me
feel a stranger indeed.

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,440
My baggage was lost; it had not come on my train; it was adrift
somewhere back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me.

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:26,680
And by way of comfort, the baggage-man remarked that passengers often got
astray from their trunks, but the trunks mostly found them after a while.

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,560
Having offered me this encouragement, he turned whistling to his
affairs and left me planted in the baggage-room at Medicine Bow.

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:41,520
I stood deserted among crates and boxes, blankly holding my check,
hungry and forlorn.

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:50,400
I stared out through the door at the sky and the plains; but I did not see the
antelope shining among the sagebrush, nor the great sunset light of Wyoming.

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Annoyance blinded my eyes to all things save my grievance: I
saw only a lost trunk.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,640
And I was muttering half-aloud, “What a forsaken hole this is!”
when suddenly from outside on the platform came a slow voice:⁠—

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,960
“Off to get married again? Oh, don’t!”

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:15,920
The voice was Southern and gentle and drawling; and a second
voice came in immediate answer, cracked and querulous:⁠—

40
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,440
“It ain’t again. Who says it’s again? Who told you, anyway?”

41
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,480
And the first voice responded caressingly:⁠—

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,680
“Why, your Sunday clothes told me, Uncle Hughey. They are speakin’
mighty loud o’ nuptials.”

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
“You don’t worry me!” snapped Uncle Hughey, with shrill heat.


44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,240
And the other gently continued, “Ain’t them gloves the same yu’
wore to your last weddin’?”

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,320
“You don’t worry me! You don’t worry me!” now screamed Uncle
Hughey.

46
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:52,240
Already I had forgotten my trunk; care had left me; I was aware of
the sunset, and had no desire but for more of this conversation.

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,760
For it resembled none that I had heard in my life so far.

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,120
I stepped to the door and looked out upon the station platform.


49
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,080
Lounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant,
more beautiful than pictures.

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:19,800
His broad, soft hat was pushed back; a loose-knotted, dull-scarlet handkerchief sagged from
his throat; and one casual thumb was hooked in the cartridge-belt that slanted across his hips.

51
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,240
He had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast
horizon, as the dust upon him showed.

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
His boots were white with it.

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,720
His overalls were gray with it.

54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:39,200
The weather-beaten bloom of his face shone through it duskily,
as the ripe peaches look upon their trees in a dry season.

55
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,520
But no dinginess of travel or shabbiness of attire could tarnish
the splendor that radiated from his youth and strength.

56
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:59,440
The old man upon whose temper his remarks were doing such deadly work was combed
and curried to a finish, a bridegroom swept and garnished; but alas for age!

57
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,680
Had I been the bride, I should have taken the giant, dust and
all.

58
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,920
He had by no means done with the old man.

59
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,280
“Why, yu’ve hung weddin’ gyarments on every limb!” he now drawled,
with admiration.

60
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,480
“Who is the lucky lady this trip?”

61
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,560
The old man seemed to vibrate.

62
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,520
“Tell you there ain’t been no other! Call me a Mormon, would
you?”

63
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
“Why, that⁠—”

64
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,200
“Call me a Mormon? Then name some of my wives. Name two. Name
one. Dare you!”

65
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,120
“⁠—that Laramie wido’ promised you⁠—”

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
“Shucks!”

67
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,640
“⁠—only her doctor suddenly ordered Southern climate and⁠—”

68
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,240
“Shucks! You’re a false alarm.”

69
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,480
“⁠—so nothing but her lungs came between you. And next you’d
most got united with Cattle Kate, only⁠—”

70
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
“Tell you you’re a false alarm!”

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
“⁠—only she got hung.”

72
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,360
“Where’s the wives in all this? Show the wives! Come now!”

73
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,600
“That corn-fed biscuit-shooter at Rawlins yu’ gave the canary⁠—”


74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,320
“Never married her. Never did marry⁠—”

75
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,920
“But yu’ come so near, uncle!

76
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,480
She was the one left yu’ that letter explaining how she’d got married to a
young cyard-player the very day before her ceremony with you was due, and⁠—”

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,400
“Oh, you’re nothing; you’re a kid; you don’t amount to⁠—”

78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,200
“⁠—and how she’d never, never forgot to feed the canary.”

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,840
“This country’s getting full of kids,” stated the old man, witheringly.


80
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,080
“It’s doomed.”

81
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,680
This crushing assertion plainly satisfied him.

82
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,840
And he blinked his eyes with renewed anticipation.

83
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,880
His tall tormentor continued with a face of unchanging gravity,
and a voice of gentle solicitude:⁠—

84
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,160
“How is the health of that unfortunate⁠—”

85
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,800
“That’s right! Pour your insults! Pour ’em on a sick, afflicted
woman!”

86
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,720
The eyes blinked with combative relish.

87
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,080
“Insults? Oh, no, Uncle Hughey!”

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,680
“That’s all right! Insults goes!”

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,800
“Why, I was mighty relieved when she began to recover her mem’ry.


90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,080
Las’ time I heard, they told me she’d got it pretty near all
back.

91
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:21,600
Remembered her father, and her mother, and her sisters and brothers, and her
friends, and her happy childhood, and all her doin’s except only your face.

92
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,760
The boys was bettin’ she’d get that far too, give her time.

93
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:31,280
But I reckon afteh such a turrable sickness as she had, that
would be expectin’ most too much.”

94
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,520
At this Uncle Hughey jerked out a small parcel.

95
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,280
“Shows how much you know!” he cackled.

96
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
“There!

97
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
See that!

98
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,960
That’s my ring she sent me back, being too unstrung for marriage.


99
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,600
So she don’t remember me, don’t she?

100
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,120
Ha-ha!

101
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,760
Always said you were a false alarm.”

102
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,400
The Southerner put more anxiety into his tone.

103
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,240
“And so you’re a-takin’ the ring right on to the next one!” he
exclaimed.

104
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,080
“Oh, don’t go to get married again, Uncle Hughey! What’s the
use o’ being married?”

105
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,880
“What’s the use?” echoed the bridegroom, with scorn.

106
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,440
“Hm! When you grow up you’ll think different.”

107
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
“Course I expect to think different when my age is different.


108
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,200
I’m havin’ the thoughts proper to twenty-four, and you’re havin’
the thoughts proper to sixty.”

109
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,760
“Fifty!” shrieked Uncle Hughey, jumping in the air.

110
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,160
The Southerner took a tone of self-reproach.

111
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:36,120
“Now, how could I forget you was fifty,” he murmured, “when you have
been telling it to the boys so careful for the last ten years!”

112
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,880
Have you ever seen a cockatoo⁠—the white kind with the topknot⁠—enraged
by insult?

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,280
The bird erects every available feather upon its person.

114
00:09:48,280 --> 00:10:01,520
So did Uncle Hughey seem to swell, clothes, mustache, and woolly white beard; and without further speech
he took himself on board the Eastbound train, which now arrived from its siding in time to deliver him.

115
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,720
Yet this was not why he had not gone away before.

116
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,560
At any time he could have escaped into the baggage-room or
withdrawn to a dignified distance until his train should come up.

117
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,760
But the old man had evidently got a sort of joy from this teasing.


118
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,560
He had reached that inevitable age when we are tickled to be
linked with affairs of gallantry, no matter how.

119
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,280
With him now the Eastbound departed slowly into that distance
whence I had come.

120
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I stared after it as it went its way to the far shores of civilization.


121
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:44,560
It grew small in the unending gulf of space, until all sign of its
presence was gone save a faint skein of smoke against the evening sky.

122
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,400
And now my lost trunk came back into my thoughts, and Medicine
Bow seemed a lonely spot.

123
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:02,000
A sort of ship had left me marooned in a foreign ocean; the Pullman was
comfortably steaming home to port, while I⁠—how was I to find Judge Henry’s ranch?

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,720
Where in this unfeatured wilderness was Sunk Creek?

125
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,800
No creek or any water at all flowed here that I could perceive.


126
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,920
My host had written he should meet me at the station and drive
me to his ranch.

127
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
This was all that I knew.

128
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,160
He was not here.

129
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,760
The baggage-man had not seen him lately.

130
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,000
The ranch was almost certain to be too far to walk to, tonight.


131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:45,440
My trunk⁠—I discovered myself still staring dolefully after the vanished Eastbound; and at the same instant I became aware that
the tall man was looking gravely at me⁠—as gravely as he had looked at Uncle Hughey throughout their remarkable conversation.

132
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:57,520
To see his eye thus fixing me and his thumb still hooked in his cartridge-belt, certain
tales of travellers from these parts forced themselves disquietingly into my recollection.

133
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:08,640
Now that Uncle Hughey was gone, was I to take his place and be, for instance,
invited to dance on the platform to the music of shots nicely aimed?

134
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,160
“I reckon I am looking for you, seh,” the tall man now observed.


135
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
CHAPTER II

136
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,080
“When You Call Me That,Smile!”

137
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,880
We cannot see ourselves as others see us, or I should know what
appearance I cut at hearing this from the tall man.

138
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,120
I said nothing, feeling uncertain.

139
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,680
“I reckon I am looking for you, seh,” he repeated politely.

140
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,520
“I am looking for Judge Henry,” I now replied.

141
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,920
He walked toward me, and I saw that in inches he was not a giant.


142
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,280
He was not more than six feet.

143
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,480
It was Uncle Hughey that had made him seem to tower.

144
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:53,040
But in his eye, in his face, in his step, in the whole man, there
dominated a something potent to be felt, I should think, by man or woman.

145
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,280
“The Judge sent me afteh you, seh,” he now explained, in his
civil Southern voice; and he handed me a letter from my host.

146
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,320
Had I not witnessed his facetious performances with Uncle Hughey,
I should have judged him wholly ungifted with such powers.

147
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,200
There was nothing external about him but what seemed the signs
of a nature as grave as you could meet.

148
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:26,360
But I had witnessed; and therefore supposing that I knew him in spite of his appearance, that I was,
so to speak, in his secret and could give him a sort of wink, I adopted at once a method of easiness.

149
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:36,480
It was so pleasant to be easy with a large stranger, who instead
of shooting at your heels had very civilly handed you a letter.

150
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,560
“You’re from old Virginia, I take it?” I began.

151
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,440
He answered slowly, “Then you have taken it correct, seh.”

152
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,360
A slight chill passed over my easiness, but I went cheerily on
with a further inquiry.

153
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,480
“Find many oddities out here like Uncle Hughey?”

154
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,520
“Yes, seh, there is a right smart of oddities around. They come
in on every train.”

155
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,480
At this point I dropped my method of easiness.

156
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
“I wish that trunks came on the train,” said I.

157
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,480
And I told him my predicament.

158
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,520
It was not to be expected that he would be greatly moved at my
loss; but he took it with no comment whatever.

159
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,760
“We’ll wait in town for it,” said he, always perfectly civil.


160
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,640
Now, what I had seen of “town” was, to my newly arrived eyes,
altogether horrible.

161
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,080
If I could possibly sleep at the Judge’s ranch, I preferred to
do so.

162
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,800
“Is it too far to drive there tonight?” I inquired.

163
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,080
He looked at me in a puzzled manner.

164
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:48,560
“For this valise,” I explained, “contains all that I immediately need; in fact,
I could do without my trunk for a day or two, if it is not convenient to send.

165
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,960
So if we could arrive there not too late by starting at once⁠—”
I paused.

166
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,920
“It’s two hundred and sixty-three miles,” said the Virginian.


167
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,560
To my loud ejaculation he made no answer, but surveyed me a
moment longer, and then said, “Supper will be about ready now.”

168
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,520
He took my valise, and I followed his steps toward the eating-house
in silence.

169
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,000
I was dazed.

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,240
As we went, I read my host’s letter⁠—a brief hospitable message.


171
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,440
He was very sorry not to meet me himself.

172
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,440
He had been getting ready to drive over, when the surveyor appeared
and detained him.

173
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,600
Therefore in his stead he was sending a trustworthy man to town,
who would look after me and drive me over.

174
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,280
They were looking forward to my visit with much pleasure.

175
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,600
This was all.

176
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,120
Yes, I was dazed.

177
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,720
How did they count distance in this country?

178
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:52,520
You spoke in a neighborly fashion about driving over to town,
and it meant⁠—I did not know yet how many days.

179
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,600
And what would be meant by the term “dropping in,” I wondered.


180
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,880
And how many miles would be considered really far?

181
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,640
I abstained from further questioning the “trustworthy man.”

182
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,680
My questions had not fared excessively well.

183
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,800
He did not propose making me dance, to be sure: that would scarcely
be trustworthy.

184
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,920
But neither did he propose to have me familiar with him.

185
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,240
Why was this?

186
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:25,200
What had I done to elicit that veiled and skilful sarcasm about
oddities coming in on every train?

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:32,600
Having been sent to look after me, he would do so, would even
carry my valise; but I could not be jocular with him.

188
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,120
This handsome, ungrammatical son of the soil had set between
us the bar of his cold and perfect civility.

189
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,640
No polished person could have done it better.

190
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,800
What was the matter?

191
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,280
I looked at him, and suddenly it came to me.

192
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:55,160
If he had tried familiarity with me the first two minutes of our acquaintance,
I should have resented it; by what right, then, had I tried it with him?

193
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,560
It smacked of patronizing: on this occasion he had come off the
better gentleman of the two.

194
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,200
Here in flesh and blood was a truth which I had long believed
in words, but never met before.

195
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:18,160
The creature we call a gentleman lies deep in the hearts of thousands
that are born without chance to master the outward graces of the type.

196
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
Between the station and the eating-house I did a deal of straight
thinking.

197
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:29,360
But my thoughts were destined presently to be drowned in amazement
at the rare personage into whose society fate had thrown me.

198
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
Town, as they called it, pleased me the less, the longer I saw
it.

199
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,320
But until our language stretches itself and takes in a new word of closer
fit, town will have to do for the name of such a place as was Medicine Bow.

200
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,080
I have seen and slept in many like it since.

201
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,120
Scattered wide, they littered the frontier from the Columbia
to the Rio Grande, from the Missouri to the Sierras.

202
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,200
They lay stark, dotted over a planet of treeless dust, like soiled
packs of cards.

203
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,040
Each was similar to the next, as one old five-spot of clubs resembles
another.

204
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:13,240
Houses, empty bottles, and garbage, they were forever of the
same shapeless pattern.

205
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,080
More forlorn they were than stale bones.

206
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,520
They seemed to have been strewn there by the wind and to be waiting
till the wind should come again and blow them away.

207
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:36,680
Yet serene above their foulness swam a pure and quiet light, such as the East
never sees; they might be bathing in the air of creation’s first morning.

208
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,920
Beneath sun and stars their days and nights were immaculate and
wonderful.

209
00:18:42,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Medicine Bow was my first, and I took its dimensions, twenty-nine buildings in all⁠—one coal shute, one water tank, the station, one store,
two eating-houses, one billiard hall, two tool-houses, one feed stable, and twelve others that for one reason and another I shall not name.

210
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:18,040
Yet this wretched husk of squalor spent thought upon appearances; many
houses in it wore a false front to seem as if they were two stories high.

211
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:37,400
There they stood, rearing their pitiful masquerade amid a fringe of old tin cans, while at their very doors began
a world of crystal light, a land without end, a space across which Noah and Adam might come straight from Genesis.

212
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:49,120
Into that space went wandering a road, over a hill and down out of sight, and up again
smaller in the distance, and down once more, and up once more, straining the eyes, and so away

213
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,120
.

214
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Then I heard a fellow greet my Virginian.

215
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,480
He came rollicking out of a door, and made a pass with his hand
at the Virginian’s hat

216
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,480
.

217
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:07,920
The Southerner dodged it, and I saw once more the tiger undulation
of body, and knew my escort was he of the rope and the corral.

218
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,480
“How are yu’ Steve?” he said to the rollicking man.

219
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,720
And in his tone I heard instantly old friendship speaking.

220
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,960
With Steve he would take and give familiarity.

221
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,600
Steve looked at me, and looked away⁠—and that was all.

222
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,480
But it was enough.

223
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,240
In no company had I ever felt so much an outsider.

224
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,640
Yet I liked the company, and wished that it would like me.

225
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,920
“Just come to town?” inquired Steve of the Virginian.

226
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,360
“Been here since noon. Been waiting for the train.”

227
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,480
“Going out tonight?”

228
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,160
“I reckon I’ll pull out tomorro’.”

229
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,320
“Beds are all took,” said Steve.

230
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
This was for my benefit.

231
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,960
“Dear me,” said I.

232
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,440
“But I guess one of them drummers will let yu’ double up with
him.”

233
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,720
Steve was enjoying himself, I think.

234
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,040
He had his saddle and blankets, and beds were nothing to him.


235
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,200
“Drummers, are they?” asked the Virginian.

236
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:15,920
“Two Jews handling cigars, one American with consumption killer,
and a Dutchman with jew’lry.”

237
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,440
The Virginian set down my valise, and seemed to meditate.

238
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,320
“I did want a bed tonight,” he murmured gently.

239
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,600
“Well,” Steve suggested, “the American looks like he washed the
oftenest.”

240
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,640
“That’s of no consequence to me,” observed the Southerner.

241
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,600
“Guess it’ll be when yu’ see ’em.”

242
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,680
“Oh, I’m meaning something different. I wanted a bed to myself.”


243
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,600
“Then you’ll have to build one.”

244
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,480
“Bet yu’ I have the Dutchman’s.”

245
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,720
“Take a man that won’t scare. Bet yu’ drinks yu’ can’t have the
American’s.”

246
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,560
“Go yu’ ” said the Virginian.

247
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,360
“I’ll have his bed without any fuss. Drinks for the crowd.”

248
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,640
“I suppose you have me beat,” said Steve, grinning at him affectionately.


249
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,920
“You’re such a son-of-a ⸻ when you get down to work. Well, so
long! I got to fix my horse’s hoofs.”

250
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,560
I had expected that the man would be struck down.

251
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,080
He had used to the Virginian a term of heaviest insult, I thought.


252
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,760
I had marvelled to hear it come so unheralded from Steve’s friendly
lips.

253
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
And now I marvelled still more.

254
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,360
Evidently he had meant no harm by it, and evidently no offence
had been taken.

255
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Used thus, this language was plainly complimentary.

256
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,840
I had stepped into a world new to me indeed, and novelties were
occurring with scarce any time to get breath between them.

257
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,920
As to where I should sleep, I had forgotten that problem altogether
in my curiosity.

258
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,200
What was the Virginian going to do now?

259
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,320
I began to know that the quiet of this man was volcanic.

260
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,880
“Will you wash first, sir?”

261
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,680
We were at the door of the eating-house, and he set my valise
inside.

262
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,880
In my tenderfoot innocence I was looking indoors for the washing
arrangements.

263
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,920
“It’s out hyeh, seh,” he informed me gravely, but with strong
Southern accent.

264
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Internal mirth seemed often to heighten the local flavor of his
speech.

265
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:23,280
There were other times when it had scarce any special accent
or fault in grammar.

266
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:32,160
A trough was to my right, slippery with soapy water; and hanging from
a roller above one end of it was a rag of discouraging appearance.

267
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,080
The Virginian caught it, and it performed one whirling revolution
on its roller.

268
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,800
Not a dry or clean inch could be found on it.

269
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,880
He took off his hat, and put his head in the door.

270
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,480
“Your towel, ma’am,” said he, “has been too popular.”

271
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,000
She came out, a pretty woman.

272
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,360
Her eyes rested upon him for a moment, then upon me with disfavor;
then they returned to his black hair.

273
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:06,000
“The allowance is one a day,” said she, very quietly.

274
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,840
“But when folks are particular⁠—” She completed her sentence
by removing the old towel and giving a clean one to us.

275
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,200
“Thank you, ma’am,” said the cowpuncher.

276
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,720
She looked once more at his black hair, and without any word
returned to her guests at supper.

277
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,160
A pail stood in the trough, almost empty; and this he filled
for me from a well.

278
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,680
There was some soap sliding at large in the trough, but I got
my own.

279
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,880
And then in a tin basin I removed as many of the stains of travel
as I was able.

280
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:47,040
It was not much of a toilet that I made in this first wash-trough of
my experience, but it had to suffice, and I took my seat at supper.

281
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,400
Canned stuff it was⁠—corned beef.

282
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,640
And one of my table companions said the truth about it.

283
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,960
“When I slung my teeth over that,” he remarked, “I thought I
was chewing a hammock.”

284
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,240
We had strange coffee, and condensed milk; and I have never seen
more flies.

285
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,360
I made no attempt to talk, for no one in this country seemed
favorable to me.

286
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:17,400
By reason of something⁠—my clothes, my hat, my pronunciation, whatever
it might be, I possessed the secret of estranging people at sight.

287
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:28,360
Yet I was doing better than I knew; my strict silence and attention to the corned beef made me
in the eyes of the cowboys at table compare well with the over-talkative commercial travellers.

288
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,400
The Virginian’s entrance produced a slight silence.

289
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,240
He had done wonders with the wash-trough, and he had somehow
brushed his clothes.

290
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,960
With all the roughness of his dress, he was now the neatest of
us.

291
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,440
He nodded to some of the other cowboys, and began his meal in
quiet.

292
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,240
But silence is not the native element of the drummer.

293
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,480
An average fish can go a longer time out of water than this breed
can live without talking.

294
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:06,320
One of them now looked across the table at the grave, flannel-shirted Virginian;
he inspected, and came to the imprudent conclusion that he understood his man.

295
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,120
“Good evening,” he said briskly.

296
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
“Good evening,” said the Virginian.

297
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,960
“Just come to town?” pursued the drummer.

298
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,840
“Just come to town,” the Virginian suavely assented.

299
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,520
“Cattle business jumping along?” inquired the drummer.

300
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,360
“Oh, fair.”

301
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,800
And the Virginian took some more corned beef.

302
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,480
“Gets a move on your appetite, anyway,” suggested the drummer.


303
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,760
The Virginian drank some coffee.

304
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,800
Presently the pretty woman refilled his cup without his asking
her.

305
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,280
“Guess I’ve met you before,” the drummer stated next.

306
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,920
The Virginian glanced at him for a brief moment.

307
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,120
“Haven’t I, now?

308
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,480
Ain’t I seen you somewhere?

309
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,240
Look at me.

310
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
You been in Chicago, ain’t you?

311
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,960
You look at me well.

312
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,920
Remember Ikey’s, don’t you?”

313
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,680
“I don’t reckon I do.”

314
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
“See, now!

315
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,840
I knowed you’d been in Chicago.

316
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
Four or five years ago.

317
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,600
Or maybe it’s two years.

318
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,160
Time’s nothing to me.

319
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,840
But I never forget a face.

320
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,320
Yes, sir.

321
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,600
Him and me’s met at Ikey’s, all right.”

322
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,760
This important point the drummer stated to all of us.

323
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,200
We were called to witness how well he had proved old acquaintanceship.


324
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,320
“Ain’t the world small, though!” he exclaimed complacently.

325
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,480
“Meet a man once and you’re sure to run on to him again. That’s
straight. That’s no barroom josh.”

326
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,080
And the drummer’s eye included us all in his confidence.

327
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,920
I wondered if he had attained that high perfection when a man
believes his own lies.

328
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,760
The Virginian did not seem interested.

329
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:49,080
He placidly attended to his food, while our landlady moved between
dining room and kitchen, and the drummer expanded.

330
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,160
“Yes, sir!

331
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,600
Ikey’s over by the stockyards, patronized by all cattlemen that
know what’s what.

332
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,400
That’s where.

333
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,080
Maybe it’s three years.

334
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,720
Time never was nothing to me.

335
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,520
But faces!

336
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Why, I can’t quit ’em.

337
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:16,240
Adults or children, male and female; onced I seen ’em I couldn’t lose
one off my memory, not if you were to pay me bounty, five dollars a face.

338
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,760
White men, that is.

339
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,440
Can’t do nothing with niggers or Chinese.

340
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
But you’re white, all right.”

341
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,920
The drummer suddenly returned to the Virginian with this high
compliment.

342
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,240
The cowpuncher had taken out a pipe, and was slowly rubbing it.


343
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,640
The compliment seemed to escape his attention, and the drummer
went on.

344
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,360
“I can tell a man when he’s white, put him at Ikey’s or out loose
here in the sagebrush.”

345
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,320
And he rolled a cigar across to the Virginian’s plate.

346
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,680
“Selling them?” inquired the Virginian.

347
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:54,880
“Solid goods, my friend.

348
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,200
Havana wrappers, the biggest tobacco proposition for five cents
got out yet.

349
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,120
Take it, try it, light it, watch it burn.

350
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,600
Here.”

351
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,720
And he held out a bunch of matches.

352
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,800
The Virginian tossed a five-cent piece over to him.

353
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,720
“Oh, no, my friend!

354
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,360
Not from you!

355
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,920
Not after Ikey’s.

356
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,320
I don’t forget you.

357
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,000
See?

358
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,400
I knowed your face right away.

359
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,120
See?

360
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,400
That’s straight.

361
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,480
I seen you at Chicago all right.”

362
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,360
“Maybe you did,” said the Virginian.

363
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
“Sometimes I’m mighty careless what I look at.”

364
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,240
“Well, py damn!” now exclaimed the Dutch drummer, hilariously.


365
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,600
“I am ploom disappointed. I vas hoping to sell him somedings
myself.”

366
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,840
“Not the same here,” stated the American.

367
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,920
“He’s too healthy for me. I gave him up on sight.”

368
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,040
Now it was the American drummer whose bed the Virginian had in
his eye.

369
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,240
This was a sensible man, and had talked less than his brothers
in the trade.

370
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,800
I had little doubt who would end by sleeping in his bed; but
how the thing would be done interested me more deeply than ever.

371
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:18,040
The Virginian looked amiably at his intended victim, and made
one or two remarks regarding patent medicines.

372
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,160
There must be a good deal of money in them, he supposed, with
a live man to manage them.

373
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,880
The victim was flattered.

374
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,080
No other person at the table had been favored with so much of
the tall cowpuncher’s notice.

375
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,680
He responded, and they had a pleasant talk.

376
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:41,280
I did not divine that the Virginian’s genius was even then at
work, and that all this was part of his satanic strategy.

377
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,600
But Steve must have divined it.

378
00:30:43,600 --> 00:31:02,920
For while a few of us still sat finishing our supper, that facetious horseman returned from doctoring his horse’s hoofs, put his head into the
dining room, took in the way in which the Virginian was engaging his victim in conversation, remarked aloud, “I’ve lost!” and closed the door again.

379
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,760
“What’s he lost?” inquired the American drummer.

380
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,040
“Oh, you mustn’t mind him,” drawled the Virginian.

381
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,640
“He’s one of those box-head jokers goes around openin’ and shuttin’
doors that-a-way.

382
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
We call him harmless.

383
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Well,” he broke off, “I reckon I’ll go smoke.

384
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,560
Not allowed in hyeh?”

385
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,880
This last he addressed to the landlady, with especial gentleness.


386
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,360
She shook her head, and her eyes followed him as he went out.


387
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,400
Left to myself I meditated for some time upon my lodging for
the night, and smoked a cigar for consolation as I walked about.

388
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,680
It was not a hotel that we had supped in.

389
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,520
Hotel at Medicine Bow there appeared to be none.

390
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:57,760
But connected with the eating-house was that place where, according to
Steve, the beds were all taken, and there I went to see for myself.

391
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,280
Steve had spoken the truth.

392
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,600
It was a single apartment containing four or five beds, and nothing
else whatever.

393
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,920
And when I looked at these beds, my sorrow that I could sleep
in none of them grew less.

394
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:17,320
To be alone in one offered no temptation, and as for this courtesy
of the country, this doubling up⁠—!

395
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,240
“Well, they have got ahead of us.”

396
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,560
This was the Virginian standing at my elbow.

397
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,640
I assented.

398
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,960
“They have staked out their claims,” he added.

399
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,960
In this public sleeping room they had done what one does to secure
a seat in a railroad train.

400
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,280
Upon each bed, as notice of occupancy, lay some article of travel
or of dress.

401
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:46,360
As we stood there, the two Jews came in and opened and arranged
their valises, and folded and refolded their linen dusters.

402
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:52,800
Then a railroad employee entered and began to go to bed at this
hour, before dusk had wholly darkened into night.

403
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:00,560
For him, going to bed meant removing his boots and placing his
overalls and waistcoat beneath his pillow.

404
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,360
He had no coat.

405
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,120
His work began at three in the morning; and even as we still
talked he began to snore.

406
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,680
“The man that keeps the store is a friend of mine,” said the
Virginian; “and you can be pretty near comfortable on his counter.

407
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,160
Got any blankets?”

408
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,000
I had no blankets.

409
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,400
“Looking for a bed?” inquired the American drummer, now arriving.


410
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,200
“Yes, he’s looking for a bed,” answered the voice of Steve behind
him.

411
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,960
“Seems a waste of time,” observed the Virginian.

412
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,920
He looked thoughtfully from one bed to another.

413
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,800
“I didn’t know I’d have to lay over here. Well, I have sat up
before.”

414
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,920
“This one’s mine,” said the drummer, sitting down on it.

415
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,480
“Half’s plenty enough room for me.”

416
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,800
“You’re cert’nly mighty kind,” said the cowpuncher.

417
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,080
“But I’d not think o’ disconveniencing yu’.”

418
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,040
“That’s nothing. The other half is yours. Turn in right now if
you feel like it.”

419
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,240
“No. I don’t reckon I’ll turn in right now. Better keep your
bed to yourself.”

420
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,240
“See here,” urged the drummer, “if I take you I’m safe from drawing
some party I might not care so much about.

421
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,080
This here sleeping proposition is a lottery.”

422
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,360
“Well,” said the Virginian (and his hesitation was truly masterly),
“if you put it that way⁠—”

423
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,200
“I do put it that way.

424
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,880
Why, you’re clean!

425
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,760
You’ve had a shave right now.

426
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,000
You turn in when you feel inclined, old man!

427
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,320
I ain’t retiring just yet.”

428
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,480
The drummer had struck a slightly false note in these last remarks.


429
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,000
He should not have said “old man.”

430
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,720
Until this I had thought him merely an amiable person who wished
to do a favor.

431
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,040
But “old man” came in wrong.

432
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:41,000
It had a hateful taint of his profession; the being too soon with everybody, the
celluloid good-fellowship that passes for ivory with nine in ten of the city crowd.

433
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,280
But not so with the sons of the sagebrush.

434
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,640
They live nearer nature, and they know better.

435
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:54,080
But the Virginian blandly accepted “old man” from his victim:
he had a game to play.

436
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,800
“Well, I cert’nly thank yu’,” he said.

437
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,440
“After a while I’ll take advantage of your kind offer.”

438
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,680
I was surprised.

439
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,920
Possession being nine points of the law, it seemed his very chance
to intrench himself in the bed.

440
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,000
But the cowpuncher had planned a campaign needing no intrenchments.


441
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,960
Moreover, going to bed before nine o’clock upon the first evening in many
weeks that a town’s resources were open to you, would be a dull proceeding.

442
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,360
Our entire company, drummer and all, now walked over to the store,
and here my sleeping arrangements were made easily.

443
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:43,080
This store was the cleanest place and the best in Medicine Bow, and would have been a good
store anywhere, offering a multitude of things for sale, and kept by a very civil proprietor.

444
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,640
He bade me make myself at home, and placed both of his counters
at my disposal.

445
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:58,160
Upon the grocery side there stood a cheese too large and strong to
sleep near comfortably, and I therefore chose the dry-goods side.

446
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:11,440
Here thick quilts were unrolled for me, to make it soft; and no condition was placed upon me,
further than that I should remove my boots, because the quilts were new, and clean, and for sale.

447
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,320
So now my rest was assured.

448
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,560
Not an anxiety remained in my thoughts.

449
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,080
These therefore turned themselves wholly to the other man’s bed,
and how he was going to lose it.

450
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,320
I think that Steve was more curious even than myself.

451
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,480
Time was on the wing.

452
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,000
His bet must be decided, and the drinks enjoyed.

453
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,760
He stood against the grocery counter, contemplating the Virginian.


454
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,800
But it was to me that he spoke.

455
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,280
The Virginian, however, listened to every word.

456
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,760
“Your first visit to this country?”

457
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,200
I told him yes.

458
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,240
“How do you like it?”

459
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,760
I expected to like it very much.

460
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,080
“How does the climate strike you?”

461
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,720
I thought the climate was fine.

462
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,320
“Makes a man thirsty though.”

463
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,080
This was the sub-current which the Virginian plainly looked for.


464
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,240
But he, like Steve, addressed himself to me.

465
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,160
“Yes,” he put in, “thirsty while a man’s soft yet.

466
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
You’ll harden.”

467
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,440
“I guess you’ll find it a drier country than you were given to
expect,” said Steve.

468
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,560
“If your habits have been frequent that way,” said the Virginian.


469
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,120
“There’s parts of Wyoming,” pursued Steve, “where you’ll go hours
and hours before you’ll see a drop of wetness.”

470
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:45,960
“And if yu’ keep a-thinkin’ about it,” said the Virginian, “it’ll
seem like days and days.”

471
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:54,360
Steve, at this stroke, gave up, and clapped him on the shoulder
with a joyous chuckle.

472
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,480
“You old son-of-a ⸻!” he cried affectionately.

473
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,560
“Drinks are due now,” said the Virginian.

474
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,960
“My treat, Steve. But I reckon your suspense will have to linger
a while yet.”

475
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:17,480
Thus they dropped into direct talk from that speech of the fourth
dimension where they had been using me for their telephone.

476
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,560
“Any cyards going tonight?” inquired the Virginian.

477
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,080
“Stud and draw,” Steve told him.

478
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,880
“Strangers playing.”

479
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,920
“I think I’d like to get into a game for a while,” said the Southerner.


480
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,760
“Strangers, yu’ say?”

481
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,000
And then, before quitting the store, he made his toilet for this
little hand at poker.

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,040
It was a simple preparation.

483
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:49,760
He took his pistol from its holster, examined it, then shoved it between
his overalls and his shirt in front, and pulled his waistcoat over it.

484
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,920
He might have been combing his hair for all the attention anyone
paid to this, except myself.

485
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,800
Then the two friends went out, and I bethought me of that epithet which
Steve again had used to the Virginian as he clapped him on the shoulder.

486
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Clearly this wild country spoke a language other than mine⁠—the
word here was a term of endearment.

487
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,240
Such was my conclusion.

488
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:17,960
The drummers had finished their dealings with the proprietor, and they
were gossiping together in a knot by the door as the Virginian passed out.

489
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,520
“See you later, old man!”

490
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,680
This was the American drummer accosting his prospective bedfellow.


491
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,680
“Oh, yes,” returned the bedfellow, and was gone.

492
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,840
The American drummer winked triumphantly at his brethren.

493
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,280
“He’s all right,” he observed, jerking a thumb after the Virginian.


494
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,960
“He’s easy. You got to know him to work him. That’s all.”

495
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,600
“Und vat is your point?” inquired the German drummer.

496
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:58,760
“Point is⁠—he’ll not take any goods off you or me; but he’s
going to talk up the killer to any consumptive he runs across.

497
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,200
I ain’t done with him yet.

498
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,960
Say,” (he now addressed the proprietor), “what’s her name?”

499
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,480
“Whose name?”

500
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,760
“Woman runs the eating-house.”

501
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,960
“Glen. Mrs. Glen.”

502
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,280
“Ain’t she new?”

503
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:17,520
“Been settled here about a month. Husband’s a freight conductor.”


504
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,640
“Thought I’d not seen her before. She’s a good-looker.”

505
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,040
“Hm! Yes. The kind of good looks I’d sooner see in another man’s
wife than mine.”

506
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,160
“So that’s the gait, is it?”

507
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,880
“Hm! well, it don’t seem to be. She come here with that reputation.
But there’s been general disappointment.”

508
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,680
“Then she ain’t lacked suitors any?”

509
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,520
“Lacked! Are you acquainted with cowboys?”

510
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:48,560
“And she disappointed ’em? Maybe she likes her husband?”

511
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,840
“Hm! well, how are you to tell about them silent kind?”

512
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,680
“Talking of conductors,” began the drummer.

513
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,320
And we listened to his anecdote.

514
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:06,440
It was successful with his audience; but when he launched fluently
upon a second I strolled out.

515
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:13,920
There was not enough wit in this narrator to relieve his indecency,
and I felt shame at having been surprised into laughing with him.

516
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,320
I left that company growing confidential over their leering stories,
and I sought the saloon.

517
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,000
It was very quiet and orderly.

518
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,080
Beer in quart bottles at a dollar I had never met before; but
saving its price, I found no complaint to make of it.

519
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,320
Through folding doors I passed from the bar proper with its
bottles and elk head back to the hall with its various tables.

520
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:41,120
I saw a man sliding cards from a case, and across the table from
him another man laying counters down.

521
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:50,480
Near by was a second dealer pulling cards from the bottom of a pack, and opposite him
a solemn old rustic piling and changing coins upon the cards which lay already exposed.

522
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,560
But now I heard a voice that drew my eyes to the far corner of
the room.

523
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
“Why didn’t you stay in Arizona?”

524
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,880
Harmless looking words as I write them down here.

525
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,240
Yet at the sound of them I noticed the eyes of the others directed
to that corner.

526
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,280
What answer was given to them I did not hear, nor did I see who
spoke.

527
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,040
Then came another remark.

528
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,720
“Well, Arizona’s no place for amatures.”

529
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:23,640
This time the two card dealers that I stood near began to give
a part of their attention to the group that sat in the corner.

530
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,760
There was in me a desire to leave this room.

531
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,560
So far my hours at Medicine Bow had seemed to glide beneath a
sunshine of merriment, of easygoing jocularity.

532
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:39,560
This was suddenly gone, like the wind changing to north in the
middle of a warm day.

533
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,480
But I stayed, being ashamed to go.

534
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,440
Five or six players sat over in the corner at a round table where
counters were piled.

535
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,600
Their eyes were close upon their cards, and one seemed to be
dealing a card at a time to each, with pauses and betting between.

536
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,520
Steve was there and the Virginian; the others were new faces.


537
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:10,200
“No place for amatures,” repeated the voice; and now I saw that
it was the dealer’s.

538
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,920
There was in his countenance the same ugliness that his words
conveyed.

539
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,400
“Who’s that talkin’?” said one of the men near me, in a low voice.


540
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,480
“Trampas.”

541
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
“What’s he?”

542
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,360
“Cowpuncher, broncobuster, tin-horn, most anything.”

543
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,440
“Who’s he talkin’ at?”

544
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,000
“Think it’s the black-headed guy he’s talking at.”

545
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,920
“That ain’t supposed to be safe, is it?”

546
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,760
“Guess we’re all goin’ to find out in a few minutes.”

547
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,680
“Been trouble between ’em?”

548
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,840
“They’ve not met before. Trampas don’t enjoy losin’ to a stranger.”


549
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,720
“Fello’s from Arizona, yu’ say?”

550
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,520
“No.

551
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,080
Virginia.

552
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,640
He’s recently back from havin’ a look at Arizona.

553
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,800
Went down there last year for a change.

554
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,520
Works for the Sunk Creek outfit.”

555
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,040
And then the dealer lowered his voice still further and said
something in the other man’s ear, causing him to grin.

556
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,320
After which both of them looked at me.

557
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,200
There had been silence over in the corner; but now the man Trampas
spoke again.

558
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,880
“And ten,” said he, sliding out some chips from before him.

559
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,080
Very strange it was to hear him, how he contrived to make those
words a personal taunt.

560
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,240
The Virginian was looking at his cards.

561
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,880
He might have been deaf.

562
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
“And twenty,” said the next player, easily.

563
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
The next threw his cards down.

564
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,920
It was now the Virginian’s turn to bet, or leave the game, and
he did not speak at once.

565
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,320
Therefore Trampas spoke.

566
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,680
“Your bet, you son-of-a ⸻.”

567
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,080
The Virginian’s pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table,
holding it unaimed.

568
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:52,800
And with a voice as gentle as ever, the voice that sounded almost like a caress, but drawling a very little
more than usual, so that there was almost a space between each word, he issued his orders to the man Trampas:⁠—

569
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,560
“When you call me that, smile.”

570
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,560
And he looked at Trampas across the table.

571
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,160
Yes, the voice was gentle.

572
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:10,680
But in my ears it seemed as if somewhere the bell of death was
ringing; and silence, like a stroke, fell on the large room.

573
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,680
All men present, as if by some magnetic current, had become aware
of this crisis.

574
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:26,320
In my ignorance, and the total stoppage of my thoughts, I stood stock-still,
and noticed various people crouching, or shifting their positions.

575
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,800
“Sit quiet,” said the dealer, scornfully to the man near me.

576
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,800
“Can’t you see he don’t want to push trouble?

577
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,880
He has handed Trampas the choice to back down or draw his steel.”


578
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,120
Then, with equal suddenness and ease, the room came out of its
strangeness.

579
00:45:46,120 --> 00:46:00,320
Voices and cards, the click of chips, the puff of tobacco, glasses lifted to drink⁠—this level of smooth
relaxation hinted no more plainly of what lay beneath than does the surface tell the depth of the sea.

580
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,240
For Trampas had made his choice.

581
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,560
And that choice was not to “draw his steel.”

582
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,160
If it was knowledge that he sought, he had found it, and no mistake!


583
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,120
We heard no further reference to what he had been pleased to
style “amatures.”

584
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:26,360
In no company would the black-headed man who had visited Arizona
be rated a novice at the cool art of self-preservation.

585
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,200
One doubt remained: what kind of a man was Trampas?

586
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,200
A public back-down is an unfinished thing⁠—for some natures at
least.

587
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,640
I looked at his face, and thought it sullen, but tricky rather
than courageous.

588
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,680
Something had been added to my knowledge also.

589
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:51,480
Once again I had heard applied to the Virginian that epithet
which Steve so freely used.

590
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,960
The same words, identical to the letter.

591
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,120
But this time they had produced a pistol.

592
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,360
“When you call me that, smile!”

593
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:04,520
So I perceived a new example of the old truth, that the letter
means nothing until the spirit gives it life.

594
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,040
CHAPTER III

595
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,320
Steve Treats

596
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,840
It was for several minutes, I suppose, that I stood drawing these
silent morals.

597
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,080
No man occupied himself with me.

598
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:20,720
Quiet voices, and games of chance, and glasses lifted to drink,
continued to be the peaceful order of the night.

599
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,760
And into my thoughts broke the voice of that card-dealer who
had already spoken so sagely.

600
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,520
He also took his turn at moralizing.

601
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:35,040
“What did I tell you?” he remarked to the man for whom he continued
to deal, and who continued to lose money to him.

602
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,000
“Tell me when?”

603
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,240
“Didn’t I tell you he’d not shoot?” the dealer pursued with complacence.


604
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:49,720
“You got ready to dodge. You had no call to be concerned. He’s
not the kind a man need feel anxious about.”

605
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,680
The player looked over at the Virginian, doubtfully.

606
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,040
“Well,” he said, “I don’t know what you folks call a dangerous
man.”

607
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,560
“Not him!” exclaimed the dealer with admiration.

608
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,040
“He’s a brave man. That’s different.”

609
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,000
The player seemed to follow this reasoning no better than I did.


610
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,200
“It’s not a brave man that’s dangerous,” continued the dealer.


611
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,920
“It’s the cowards that scare me.”

612
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,280
He paused that this might sink home.

613
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,240
“Fello’ came in here las’ Toosday ,” he went on.

614
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,080
“He got into some misunderstanding about the drinks.

615
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:24,840
Well, sir, before we could put him out of business, he’d hurt
two perfectly innocent onlookers.

616
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,480
They’d no more to do with it than you have,” the dealer explained
to me.

617
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,000
“Were they badly hurt?” I asked.

618
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,240
“One of ’em was. He’s died since.”

619
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,040
“What became of the man?”

620
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,280
“Why, we put him out of business, I told you.

621
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,200
He died that night.

622
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,040
But there was no occasion for any of it; and that’s why I never
like to be around where there’s a coward.

623
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
You can’t tell.

624
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,760
He’ll always go to shooting before it’s necessary, and there’s
no security who he’ll hit.

625
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,000
But a man like that black-headed guy is (the dealer indicated
the Virginian) need never worry you.

626
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,520
And there’s another point why there’s no need to worry about
him: it’ll be too late.”

627
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,280
These good words ended the moralizing of the dealer.

628
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,480
He had given us a piece of his mind.

629
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,080
He now gave the whole of it to dealing cards.

630
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:16,160
I loitered here and there, neither welcome nor unwelcome at present,
watching the cowboys at their play.

631
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,120
Saving Trampas, there was scarce a face among them that had not
in it something very likable.

632
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:30,840
Here were lusty horsemen ridden from the heat of the sun, and
the wet of the storm, to divert themselves awhile.

633
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,760
Youth untamed sat here for an idle moment, spending easily its
hard-earned wages.

634
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,840
City saloons rose into my vision, and I instantly preferred this
Rocky Mountain place.

635
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:49,760
More of death it undoubtedly saw, but less of vice, than did
its New York equivalents

636
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:49,800
.

637
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,520
And death is a thing much cleaner than vice.

638
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,360
Moreover, it was by no means vice that was written upon these
wild and manly faces.

639
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,880
Even where baseness was visible, baseness was not uppermost.

640
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:10,520
Daring, laughter, endurance⁠—these were what I saw upon the countenances
of the cowboys.

641
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,160
And this very first day of my knowledge of them marks a date
with me.

642
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:22,440
For something about them, and the idea of them, smote my American heart,
and I have never forgotten it, nor ever shall, as long as I live.

643
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:34,600
In their flesh our natural passions ran tumultuous; but often in their spirit sat hidden a
true nobility, and often beneath its unexpected shining their figures took on heroic stature.

644
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,040
The dealer had styled the Virginian “a black-headed guy.”

645
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,480
This did well enough as an unflattered portrait.

646
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:51,120
Judge Henry’s trustworthy man, with whom I was to drive two hundred
and sixty-three miles, certainly had a very black head of hair.

647
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,080
It was the first thing to notice now, if one glanced generally
at the table where he sat at cards.

648
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:06,040
But the eye came back to him⁠—drawn by that inexpressible something
which had led the dealer to speak so much at length about him.

649
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,320
Still, “black-headed guy” justly fits him and his next performance.


650
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:18,800
He had made his plan for this like a true and (I must say) inspired
devil.

651
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:27,760
And now the highly appreciative town of Medicine Bow was to be
treated to a manifestation of genius.

652
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,280
He sat playing his stud-poker.

653
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:41,640
After a decent period of losing and winning, which gave Trampas all proper time for a
change of luck and a repairing of his fortunes, he looked at Steve and said amiably:⁠—

654
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,120
“How does bed strike you?”

655
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:52,040
I was beside their table, learning gradually that stud-poker has in
it more of what I will call red pepper than has our Eastern game.

656
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,600
The Virginian followed his own question:⁠—

657
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,160
“Bed strikes me,” he stated.

658
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,720
Steve feigned indifference.

659
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:14,920
He was far more deeply absorbed in his bet and the American drummer than he was in this game; but he
chose to take out a fat, florid gold watch, consult it elaborately, and remark, “It’s only eleven.”

660
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,400
“Yu’ forget I’m from the country,” said the black-headed guy.


661
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,160
“The chickens have been roostin’ a right smart while.”

662
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,440
His sunny Southern accent was again strong.

663
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,120
In that brief passage with Trampas it had been almost wholly
absent.

664
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:36,640
But different moods of the spirit bring different qualities of
utterance⁠—where a man comes by these naturally.

665
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,280
The Virginian cashed in his checks.

666
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,960
“Awhile ago,” said Steve, “you had won three months’ salary.”


667
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,400
“I’m still twenty dollars to the good,” said the Virginian.

668
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,160
“That’s better than breaking a laig.”

669
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,960
Again, in some voiceless, masonic way, most people in that saloon
had become aware that something was in process of happening.

670
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,240
Several left their games and came to the front by the bar.

671
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,000
“If he ain’t in bed yet⁠—” mused the Virginian.

672
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,680
“I’ll find out,” said I.

673
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,000
And I hurried across to the dim sleeping room, happy to have
a part in this.

674
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,400
They were all in bed; and in some beds two were sleeping.

675
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,840
How they could do it⁠—but in those days I was fastidious.

676
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,960
The American had come in recently and was still awake.

677
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,480
“Thought you were to sleep at the store?” said he.

678
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:30,400
So then I invented a little lie, and explained that I was in
search of the Virginian.

679
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,680
“Better search the dives,” said he.

680
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,840
“These cowboys don’t get to town often.”

681
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,760
At this point I stumbled sharply over something.

682
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:47,440
“It’s my box of Consumption Killer,” explained the drummer; “Well,
I hope that man will stay out all night.”

683
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,240
“Bed narrow?” I inquired.

684
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:55,640
“For two it is. And the pillows are mean. Takes both before you
feel anything’s under your head.”

685
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,200
He yawned, and I wished him pleasant dreams.

686
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:06,320
At my news the Virginian left the bar at once; and crossed to
the sleeping room.

687
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:12,000
Steve and I followed softly, and behind us several more strung
out in an expectant line.

688
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,160
“What is this going to be?” they inquired curiously of each other.


689
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:26,320
And upon learning the great novelty of the event, they clustered with
silence intense outside the door where the Virginian had gone in.

690
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,440
We heard the voice of the drummer, cautioning his bedfellow.

691
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,480
“Don’t trip over the Killer,” he was saying.

692
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,800
“The Prince of Wales barked his shin just now.”

693
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,480
It seemed my English clothes had earned me this title.

694
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,560
The boots of the Virginian were next heard to drop.

695
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,800
“Can yu’ make out what he’s at?” whispered Steve.

696
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,320
He was plainly undressing.

697
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,360
The rip of swift unbuttoning told us that the black-headed guy
must now be removing his overalls.

698
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:56,120
“Why, thank yu’, no,” he was replying to a question of the drummer.


699
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,240
“Outside or in’s all one to me.”

700
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,600
“Then, if you’d just as soon take the wall⁠—”

701
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,720
“Why, cert’nly.”

702
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,920
There was a sound of bedclothes, and creaking.

703
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,800
“This hyeh pillo’ needs a Southern climate,” was the Virginian’s
next observation.

704
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,080
Many listeners had now gathered at the door.

705
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,840
The dealer and the player were both here.

706
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,520
The storekeeper was present, and I recognized the agent of the
Union Pacific Railroad among the crowd.

707
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:28,720
We made a large company, and I felt that trembling sensation which is
common when the cap of a camera is about to be removed upon a group.

708
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,240
“I should think,” said the drummer’s voice, “that you’d feel
your knife and gun clean through that pillow.”

709
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,920
“I do,” responded the Virginian.

710
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:43,080
“I should think you’d put them on a chair and be comfortable.”


711
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:49,000
“I’d be uncomfortable, then.”

712
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,320
“Used to the feel of them, I suppose?”

713
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,080
“That’s it. Used to the feel of them. I would miss them, and
that would make me wakeful.”

714
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,360
“Well, good night.”

715
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,880
“Good night. If I get to talkin’ and tossin’, or whatnot, you’ll
understand you’re to⁠—”

716
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,800
“Yes, I’ll wake you.”

717
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,240
“No, don’t yu’, for God’s sake!”

718
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,400
“Not?”

719
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,520
“Don’t yu’ touch me.”

720
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:09,920
“What’ll I do?”

721
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,200
“Roll away quick to your side. It don’t last but a minute.”

722
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,840
The Virginian spoke with a reassuring drawl.

723
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:22,280
Upon this there fell a brief silence, and I heard the drummer
clear his throat once or twice.

724
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,320
“It’s merely the nightmare, I suppose?” he said after a throat
clearing.

725
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,080
“Lord, yes. That’s all. And don’t happen twice a year. Was you
thinkin’ it was fits?”

726
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,960
“Oh, no!

727
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,720
I just wanted to know.

728
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,640
I’ve been told before that it was not safe for a person to be
waked suddenly that way out of a nightmare.”

729
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:45,000
“Yes, I have heard that too. But it never harms me any. I didn’t
want you to run risks.”

730
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,120
“Me?”

731
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,200
“Oh, it’ll be all right now that yu’ know how it is.”

732
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,680
The Virginian’s drawl was full of assurance.

733
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,160
There was a second pause, after which the drummer said:⁠—

734
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,960
“Tell me again how it is.”

735
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:07,880
The Virginian answered very drowsily: “Oh, just don’t let your
arm or your laig touch me if I go to jumpin’ around.

736
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,720
I’m dreamin’ of Indians when I do that.

737
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,520
And if anything touches me then, I’m liable to grab my knife
right in my sleep.”

738
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,440
“Oh, I understand,” said the drummer, clearing his throat.

739
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,120
“Yes.”

740
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:25,240
Steve was whispering delighted oaths to himself, and in his joy
applying to the Virginian one unprintable name after another.

741
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,760
We listened again, but now no further words came.

742
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,880
Listening very hard, I could half make out the progress of a
heavy breathing, and a restless turning I could clearly detect.

743
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,200
This was the wretched drummer.

744
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,600
He was waiting.

745
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,920
But he did not wait long.

746
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,720
Again there was a light creak, and after it a light step.

747
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,320
He was not even going to put his boots on in the fatal neighborhood
of the dreamer.

748
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,200
By a happy thought Medicine Bow formed into two lines, making
an avenue from the door.

749
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,720
And then the commercial traveller forgot his Consumption Killer.


750
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,760
He fell heavily over it.

751
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,600
Immediately from the bed the Virginian gave forth a dreadful
howl.

752
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,040
And then everything happened at once; and how shall mere words
narrate it?

753
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:13,480
The door burst open, and out flew the commercial traveller in
his stockings.

754
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:22,000
One hand held a lump of coat and trousers with suspenders dangling,
his boots were clutched in the other.

755
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,080
The sight of us stopped his flight short.

756
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:35,640
He gazed, the boots fell from his hand; and at his profane explosion, Medicine
Bow set up a united, unearthly noise and began to play Virginia reel with him.

757
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:42,960
The other occupants of the beds had already sprung out of them,
clothed chiefly with their pistols, and ready for war.

758
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
“What is it?” they demanded.

759
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,480
“What is it?”

760
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,600
“Why, I reckon it’s drinks on Steve,” said the Virginian from
his bed.

761
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,960
And he gave the first broad grin that I had seen from him.

762
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,880
“I’ll set ’em up all night!” Steve shouted, as the reel went
on regardless.

763
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,840
The drummer was bawling to be allowed to put at least his boots
on.

764
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,480
“This way, Pard,” was the answer; and another man whirled him
round.

765
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,320
“This way, Beau!” they called to him; “This way, Budd!” and he
was passed like a shuttlecock down the line.

766
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,440
Suddenly the leaders bounded into the sleeping-room.

767
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,320
“Feed the machine!” they said.

768
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,840
“Feed her!”

769
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,480
And seizing the German drummer who sold jewellery, they flung
him into the trough of the reel.

770
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,360
I saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn to be shelled, and
the dance ingulfed him.

771
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:40,120
I saw a Jew sent rattling after him; and next they threw in the railroad employee,
and the other Jew; and while I stood mesmerized, my own feet left the earth.

772
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:51,560
I shot from the room and sped like a bobbing cork into this mill race, whirling my
turn in the wake of the others amid cries of, “Here comes the Prince of Wales!”

773
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,640
There was soon not much English left about my raiment.

774
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,640
They were now shouting for music.

775
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:10,440
Medicine Bow swept in like a cloud of dust to where a fiddler sat playing in a hall; and
gathering up fiddler and dancers, swept out again, a larger Medicine Bow, growing all the while.

776
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,680
Steve offered us the freedom of the house, everywhere.

777
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,360
He implored us to call for whatever pleased us, and as many times
as we should please.

778
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,480
He ordered the town to be searched for more citizens to come
and help him pay his bet.

779
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,480
But changing his mind, kegs and bottles were now carried along
with us.

780
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:38,280
We had found three fiddlers, and these played busily for us; and thus we set out
to visit all cabins and houses where people might still by some miracle be asleep.

781
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,040
The first man put out his head to decline.

782
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:47,960
But such a possibility had been foreseen by the proprietor of
the store.

783
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:55,120
This seemingly respectable man now came dragging some sort of
apparatus from his place, helped by the Virginian.

784
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,080
The cowboys cheered, for they knew what this was.

785
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:05,160
The man in his window likewise recognized it, and uttering a
groan, came immediately out and joined us.

786
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,560
What it was, I also learned in a few minutes.

787
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:13,040
For we found a house where the people made no sign at either
our fiddlers or our knocking.

788
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,120
And then the infernal machine was set to work.

789
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,800
Its parts seemed to be no more than an empty keg and a plank.


790
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:26,000
Some citizen informed me that I should soon have a new idea of noise;
and I nerved myself for something severe in the way of gunpowder.

791
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:36,480
But the Virginian and the proprietor now sat on the ground holding the keg braced,
and two others got down apparently to play seesaw over the top of it with the plank.

792
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:44,560
But the keg and plank had been rubbed with rosin, and they drew
the plank back and forth over the keg.

793
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,560
Do you know the sound made in a narrow street by a dray loaded
with strips of iron?

794
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:55,320
That noise is a lullaby compared with the staggering, blinding
bellow which rose from the keg.

795
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:06,120
If you were to try it in your native town, you would not merely be arrested, you
would be hanged, and everybody would be glad, and the clergyman would not bury you.

796
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:18,800
My head, my teeth, the whole system of my bones leaped and chattered at the din,
and out of the house like drops squirted from a lemon came a man and his wife.

797
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,280
No time was given them.

798
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:29,040
They were swept along with the rest; and having been routed from their own bed,
they now became most furious in assailing the remaining homes of Medicine Bow.

799
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,360
Everybody was to come out.

800
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:42,280
Many were now riding horses at top speed out into the plains and back, while the
procession of the plank and keg continued its work, and the fiddlers played incessantly.

801
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,520
Suddenly there was a quiet.

802
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:53,200
I did not see who brought the message; but the word ran among us that
there was a woman⁠—the engineer’s woman down by the water-tank⁠—very sick.

803
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,960
The doctor had been to see her from Laramie.

804
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,720
Everybody liked the engineer.

805
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,960
Plank and keg were heard no more.

806
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,800
The horsemen found it out and restrained their gambols.

807
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,520
Medicine Bow went gradually home.

808
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:39,040
I saw doors shutting, and lights go out; I saw a late few reassemble at the card tables, and the drummers gathered themselves together for sleep; the proprietor of the
store (you could not see a more respectable-looking person) hoped that I would be comfortable on the quilts; and I heard Steve urging the Virginian to take one more glass.

809
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,800
“We’ve not met for so long,” he said.

810
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,960
But the Virginian, the black-headed guy who had set all this
nonsense going, said No to Steve.

811
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,360
“I have got to stay responsible,” was his excuse to his friend.


812
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,600
And the friend looked at me.

813
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:59,080
Therefore I surmised that the Judge’s trustworthy man found me
an embarrassment to his holiday.

814
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,720
But if he did, he never showed it to me.

815
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:11,200
He had been sent to meet a stranger and drive him to Sunk Creek in
safety, and this charge he would allow no temptation to imperil.

816
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,240
He nodded good night to me.

817
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,960
“If there’s anything I can do for yu’, you’ll tell me.”

818
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,600
I thanked him.

819
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,600
“What a pleasant evening!” I added.

820
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,040
“I’m glad yu’ found it so.”

821
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:26,160
Again his manner put a bar to my approaches.

822
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:32,280
Even though I had seen him wildly disporting himself, those were
matters which he chose not to discuss with me.

823
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,560
Medicine Bow was quiet as I went my way to my quilts.

824
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:43,680
So still, that through the air the deep whistles of the freight
trains came from below the horizon across great miles of silence.

825
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,840
I passed cowboys, whom half an hour before I had seen prancing and
roaring, now rolled in their blankets beneath the open and shining night.

826
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,160
“What world am I in?” I said aloud.

827
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,800
“Does this same planet hold Fifth Avenue?”

828
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,440
And I went to sleep, pondering over my native land.

829
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,960
CHAPTER IV

830
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,800
Deep Into Cattle Land

831
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:05,800
Morning had been for some while astir in Medicine Bow before
I left my quilts.

832
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:11,120
The new day and its doings began around me in the store, chiefly
at the grocery counter.

833
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,960
Dry-goods were not in great request.

834
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:27,560
The early rising cowboys were off again to their work; and those to whom their night’s holiday had left any dollars
were spending these for tobacco, or cartridges, or canned provisions for the journey to their distant camps.

835
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:37,640
Sardines were called for, and potted chicken, and devilled ham: a
sophisticated nourishment, at first sight, for these sons of the sagebrush.

836
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,800
But portable ready-made food plays of necessity a great part
in the opening of a new country.

837
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,640
These picnic pots and cans were the first of her trophies that
Civilization dropped upon Wyoming’s virgin soil.

838
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:57,040
The cowboy is now gone to worlds invisible; the wind has blown away the white ashes of
his campfires; but the empty sardine box lies rusting over the face of the Western earth.

839
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:11,960
So through my eyes half closed I watched the sale of these tins, and grew familiar with the ham’s inevitable trademark⁠—that
label with the devil and his horns and hoofs and tail very pronounced, all colored a sultry prodigious scarlet.

840
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:19,560
And when each horseman had made his purchase, he would trail his spurs over the
floor, and presently the sound of his horse’s hoofs would be the last of him.

841
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:25,760
Through my dozing attention came various fragments of talk, and
sometimes useful bits of knowledge.

842
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,120
For instance, I learned the true value of tomatoes in this country.


843
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,440
One fellow was buying two cans of them.

844
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
“Meadow Creek dry already?” commented the proprietor.

845
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,840
“Been dry ten days,” the young cowboy informed him.

846
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:48,000
And it appeared that along the road he was going, water would not be
reached much before sundown, because this Meadow Creek had ceased to run.

847
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,640
His tomatoes were for drink.

848
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,040
And thus they have refreshed me many times since.

849
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,600
“No beer?” suggested the proprietor.

850
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,440
The boy made a shuddering face.

851
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,760
“Don’t say its name to me!” he exclaimed.

852
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,920
“I couldn’t hold my breakfast down.”

853
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,320
He rang his silver money upon the counter.

854
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,640
“I’ve swore off for three months,” he stated.

855
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,480
“I’m going to be as pure as the snow!”

856
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,800
And away he went jingling out of the door, to ride seventy-five
miles.

857
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Three more months of hard, unsheltered work, and he would ride into
town again, with his adolescent blood crying aloud for its own.

858
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,880
“I’m obliged,” said a new voice, rousing me from a new doze.

859
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,240
“She’s easier this morning, since the medicine.”

860
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:35,520
This was the engineer, whose sick wife had brought a hush over
Medicine Bow’s rioting.

861
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,240
“I’ll give her them flowers soon as she wakes,” he added.

862
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,960
“Flowers?” repeated the proprietor.

863
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,320
“You didn’t leave that bunch at our door?”

864
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,520
“Wish I’d thought to do it.”

865
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,440
“She likes to see flowers,” said the engineer.

866
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,800
And he walked out slowly, with his thanks unachieved.

867
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,960
He returned at once with the Virginian; for in the band of the
Virginian’s hat were two or three blossoms.

868
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,600
“It don’t need mentioning,” the Southerner was saying, embarrassed
by any expression of thanks.

869
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,560
“If we had knowed last night⁠—”

870
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,000
“You didn’t disturb her any,” broke in the engineer.

871
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,680
“She’s easier this morning. I’ll tell her about them flowers.”


872
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:23,480
“Why, it don’t need mentioning,” the Virginian again protested,
almost crossly.

873
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,920
“The little things looked kind o’ fresh, and I just picked them.”


874
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,320
His eye now fell upon me, where I lay upon the counter.

875
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,040
“I reckon breakfast will be getting through,” he remarked.

876
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,360
I was soon at the wash trough.

877
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:45,760
It was only half-past six, but many had been before me⁠—one glance
at the roller-towel told me that.

878
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:55,520
I was afraid to ask the landlady for a clean one, and so I
found a fresh handkerchief, and accomplished a sparing toilet.

879
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:03,920
In the midst of this the drummers joined me, one by one, and
they used the degraded towel without hesitation.

880
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,280
In a way they had the best of me; filth was nothing to them.

881
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:14,080
The latest risers in Medicine Bow, we sat at breakfast together;
and they essayed some light familiarities with the landlady.

882
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,280
But these experiments were failures.

883
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,120
Her eyes did not see, nor did her ears hear them.

884
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:25,440
She brought the coffee and the bacon with a sedateness that propriety
itself could scarce have surpassed.

885
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,840
Yet impropriety lurked noiselessly all over her.

886
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,960
You could not have specified how; it was interblended with her
sum total.

887
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:39,840
Silence was her apparent habit and her weapon; but the American drummer
found that she could speak to the point when need came for this.

888
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,880
During the meal he had praised her golden hair.

889
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,800
It was golden indeed, and worth a high compliment; but his kind
displeased her.

890
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,640
She had let it pass, however, with no more than a cool stare.


891
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:56,520
But on taking his leave, when he came to pay for the meal, he
pushed it too far.

892
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,760
“Pity this must be our last,” he said; and as it brought no answer,
“Ever travel?” he inquired.

893
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,480
“Where I go, there’s room for a pair of us.”

894
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,320
“Then you’d better find another jackass,” she replied quietly.


895
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,200
I was glad that I had not asked for a clean towel.

896
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:20,840
From the commercial travellers I now separated myself, and wandered
alone in pleasurable aimlessness.

897
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,880
It was seven o’clock.

898
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,280
Medicine Bow stood voiceless and unpeopled.

899
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,560
The cowboys had melted away.

900
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:32,080
The inhabitants were indoors, pursuing the business or the idleness
of the forenoon.

901
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,560
Visible motion there was none.

902
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,440
No shell upon the dry sands could lie more lifeless than Medicine
Bow.

903
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,320
Looking in at the store, I saw the proprietor sitting with his
pipe extinct.

904
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,080
Looking in at the saloon, I saw the dealer dealing dumbly to
himself.

905
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:51,760
Up in the sky there was not a cloud nor a bird, and on the earth
the lightest straw lay becalmed.

906
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,800
Once I saw the Virginian at an open door, where the golden-haired
landlady stood talking with him.

907
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:03,440
Sometimes I strolled in the town, and sometimes out on the plain
I lay down with my day dreams in the sagebrush.

908
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:11,440
Pale herds of antelope were in the distance, and near by the
demure prairie-dogs sat up and scrutinized me.

909
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:24,320
Steve, Trampas, the riot of horsemen, my lost trunk, Uncle Hughey, with his abortive
brides⁠—all things merged in my thoughts in a huge, delicious indifference.

910
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:33,280
It was like swimming slowly at random in an ocean that was smooth,
and neither too cool nor too warm.

911
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,840
And before I knew it, five lazy imperceptible hours had gone
thus.

912
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,960
There was the Union Pacific train, coming as if from shores forgotten.


913
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,440
Its approach was silent and long drawn out.

914
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:56,000
I easily reached town and the platform before it had finished
watering at the tank.

915
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:07,920
It moved up, made a short halt, I saw my trunk come out of it, and then it
moved away silently as it had come, smoking and dwindling into distance unknown.

916
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,840
Beside my trunk was one other, tied extravagantly with white
ribbon.

917
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:19,200
The fluttering bows caught my attention, and now I suddenly saw
a perfectly new sight.

918
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:24,520
The Virginian was further down the platform, doubled up with
laughing.

919
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:33,000
It was good to know that with sufficient cause he could laugh
like this; a smile had thus far been his limit of external mirth.

920
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,840
Rice now flew against my hat, and hissing gusts of rice spouted
on the platform.

921
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,480
All the men left in Medicine Bow appeared like magic, and more
rice choked the atmosphere.

922
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:55,120
Through the general clamor a cracked voice said, “Don’t hit her in the eye,
boys!” and Uncle Hughey rushed proudly by me with an actual wife on his arm.

923
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:59,920
She could easily have been his granddaughter.

924
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,520
They got at once into a vehicle.

925
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,880
The trunk was lifted in behind.

926
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:18,840
And amid cheers, rice, shoes, and broad felicitations, the pair drove out of
town, Uncle Hughey shrieking to the horses and the bride waving unabashed adieus.

927
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:25,320
The word had come over the wires from Laramie: “Uncle Hughey
has made it this time.

928
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,880
Expect him on today’s number two.”

929
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,040
And Medicine Bow had expected him.

930
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,600
Many words arose on the departure of the new-married couple.

931
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,160
“Who’s she?”

932
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,280
“What’s he got for her?”

933
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,080
“Got a gold mine up Bear Creek.”

934
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:41,760
And after comment and prophecy, Medicine Bow returned to its
dinner.

935
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,000
This meal was my last here for a long while.

936
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:54,440
The Virginian’s responsibility now returned; duty drove the Judge’s
trustworthy man to take care of me again.

937
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:04,960
He had not once sought my society of his own accord; his distaste for what
he supposed me to be (I don’t exactly know what this was) remained unshaken.

938
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:18,760
I have thought that matters of dress and speech should not carry with them so much mistrust in our
democracy; thieves are presumed innocent until proved guilty, but a starched collar is condemned at once.

939
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:28,200
Perfect civility and obligingness I certainly did receive from
the Virginian, only not a word of fellowship.

940
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:38,240
He harnessed the horses, got my trunk, and gave me some advice about taking provisions
for our journey, something more palatable than what food we should find along the road.

941
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,720
It was well thought of, and I bought quite a parcel of dainties,
feeling that he would despise both them and me.

942
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:56,280
And thus I took my seat beside him, wondering what we should
manage to talk about for two hundred and sixty-three miles.

943
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,120
Farewell in those days was not said in Cattle Land.

944
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:09,400
Acquaintances watched our departure with a nod or with nothing, and
the nearest approach to “Goodbye” was the proprietor’s “So-long.”

945
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,400
But I caught sight of one farewell given without words.

946
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:18,320
As we drove by the eating-house, the shade of a side window was
raised, and the landlady looked her last upon the Virginian.

947
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:25,640
Her lips were faintly parted, and no woman’s eyes ever said more
plainly, “I am one of your possessions.”

948
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,880
She had forgotten that it might be seen.

949
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,800
Her glance caught mine, and she backed into the dimness of the
room.

950
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:37,400
What look she may have received from him, if he gave her any
at this too public moment, I could not tell.

951
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,720
His eyes seemed to be upon the horses, and he drove with the
same mastering ease that had roped the wild pony yesterday.

952
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:52,560
We passed the ramparts of Medicine Bow⁠—thick heaps and fringes of
tin cans, and shelving mounds of bottles cast out of the saloons.

953
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,120
The sun struck these at a hundred glittering points.

954
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,280
And in a moment we were in the clean plains, with the prairie-dogs
and the pale herds of antelope.

955
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:11,360
The great, still air bathed us, pure as water and strong as wine; the sunlight flooded the world;
and shining upon the breast of the Virginian’s flannel shirt lay a long gold thread of hair!

956
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:17,120
The noisy American drummer had met defeat, but this silent free
lance had been easily victorious.

957
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:25,800
It must have been five miles that we travelled in silence, losing
and seeing the horizon among the ceaseless waves of the earth.

958
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,520
Then I looked back, and there was Medicine Bow, seemingly a stone’s
throw behind us.

959
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:37,320
It was a full half-hour before I looked back again, and there
sure enough was always Medicine Bow.

960
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,600
A size or two smaller, I will admit, but visible in every feature,
like something seen through the wrong end of a field glass.

961
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:55,360
The Eastbound express was approaching the town, and I noticed the white steam
from its whistle; but when the sound reached us, the train had almost stopped.

962
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:02,040
And in reply to my comment upon this, the Virginian deigned to
remark that it was more so in Arizona.

963
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,520
“A man come to Arizona,” he said, “with one of them telescopes
to study the heavenly bodies.

964
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,760
He was a Yankee, seh, and a right smart one, too.

965
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:20,360
And one night we was watchin’ for some little old fallin’ stars that he said was due,
and I saw some lights movin’ along across the mesa pretty lively, an’ I sang out.

966
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,920
But he told me it was just the train.

967
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:31,280
And I told him I didn’t know yu’ could see the cyars that plain from his place, ‘Yu’
can see them,’ he said to me, ‘but it is las’ night’s cyars you’re lookin’ at.’ ”

968
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,480
At this point the Virginian spoke severely to one of the horses.


969
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:42,520
“Of course,” he then resumed to me, “that Yankee man did not mean quite
all he said.⁠—You, Buck!” he again broke off suddenly to the horse.

970
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,040
“But Arizona, seh,” he continued, “it cert’nly has a mos’ deceivin’
atmospheah.

971
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:55,120
Another man told me he had seen a lady close one eye at him when
he was two minutes hard run from her.”

972
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
This time the Virginian gave Buck the whip.

973
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:06,360
“What effect,” I inquired with a gravity equal to his own, “does
this extraordinary foreshortening have upon a quart of whiskey?”

974
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,120
“When it’s outside yu’, seh, no distance looks too far to go
to it.”

975
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:16,720
He glanced at me with an eye that held more confidence than hitherto
he had been able to feel in me.

976
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,320
I had made one step in his approval.

977
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,400
But I had many yet to go.

978
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:33,080
This day he preferred his own thoughts to my conversation, and so he did all the days of
this first journey; while I should have greatly preferred his conversation to my thoughts.

979
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:45,600
He dismissed some attempts that I made upon the subject of Uncle Hughey so that I had not the courage
to touch upon Trampas, and that chill brief collision which might have struck the spark of death.

980
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,520
Trampas!

981
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,680
I had forgotten him till this silent drive I was beginning.

982
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,960
I wondered if I should ever see him, or Steve, or any of those
people again.

983
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,800
And this wonder I expressed aloud.

984
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,560
“There’s no tellin’ in this country ,” said the Virginian.

985
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,600
“Folks come easy, and they go easy.

986
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,680
In settled places, like back in the States, even a poor man mostly
has a home.

987
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:17,760
Don’t care if it’s only a barrel on a lot, the fello’ will keep
frequentin’ that lot, and if yu’ want him yu’ can find him.

988
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,520
But out hyeh in the sagebrush, a man’s home is apt to be his
saddle blanket.

989
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,840
First thing yu’ know, he has moved it to Texas.”

990
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,320
“You have done some moving yourself,” I suggested.

991
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,280
But this word closed his mouth.

992
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:37,160
“I have had a look at the country,” he said, and we were silent
again.

993
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:54,840
Let me, however, tell you here that he had set out for a “look at the country” at the age of fourteen; and that by his
present age of twenty-four he had seen Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

994
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:04,360
Everywhere he had taken care of himself, and survived; nor had
his strong heart yet waked up to any hunger for a home.

995
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:10,680
Let me also tell you that he was one of thousands drifting and
living thus, but (as you shall learn) one in a thousand.

996
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,560
Medicine Bow did not forever remain in sight.

997
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:25,960
When next I thought of it and looked behind, nothing was there but the road we
had come; it lay like a ship’s wake across the huge ground swell of the earth.

998
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,240
We were swallowed in a vast solitude.

999
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:33,080
A little while before sunset, a cabin came in view; and here
we passed our first night.

1000
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,840
Two young men lived here, tending their cattle.

1001
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,320
They were fond of animals.

1002
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:46,560
By the stable a chained coyote rushed nervously in a circle, or
sat on its haunches and snapped at gifts of food ungraciously.

1003
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,880
A tame young elk walked in and out of the cabin door, and during
supper it tried to push me off my chair.

1004
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:57,640
A half-tame mountain sheep practised jumping from the ground
to the roof.

1005
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:03,240
The cabin was papered with posters of a circus, and skins of
bear and silver fox lay upon the floor.

1006
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,680
Until nine o’clock one man talked to the Virginian, and one played
gayly upon a concertina; and then we all went to bed.

1007
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:19,760
The air was like December, but in my blankets and a buffalo
robe I kept warm, and luxuriated in the Rocky Mountain silence.

1008
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:25,360
Going to wash before breakfast at sunrise, I found needles of
ice in a pail.

1009
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:35,120
Yet it was hard to remember that this quiet, open, splendid wilderness
(with not a peak in sight just here) was six thousand feet high.

1010
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:44,640
And when breakfast was over there was no December left; and by the
time the Virginian and I were ten miles upon our way, it was June.

1011
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:50,520
But always every breath that I breathed was pure as water and
strong as wine.

1012
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,840
We never passed a human being this day.

1013
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:19,960
Some wild cattle rushed up to us and away from us; antelope stared at us from a hundred yards; coyotes ran skulking through the sagebrush to watch
us from a hill; at our noon meal we killed a rattlesnake and shot some young sage chickens, which were good at supper, roasted at our campfire.

1014
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:27,000
By half-past eight we were asleep beneath the stars, and by half-past
four I was drinking coffee and shivering.

1015
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,720
The horse, Buck, was hard to catch this second morning.

1016
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:43,120
Whether some hills that we were now in had excited him, or whether the better
water up here had caused an effervescence in his spirits, I cannot say.

1017
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,800
But I was as hot as July by the time we had him safe in harness,
or, rather, unsafe in harness.

1018
01:22:47,800 --> 01:23:02,240
For Buck, in the mysterious language of horses, now taught wickedness to his side partner,
and about eleven o’clock they laid their evil heads together and decided to break our necks.

1019
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,680
We were passing, I have said, through a range of demi-mountains.


1020
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:10,560
It was a little country where trees grew, water ran, and the
plains were shut out for a while.

1021
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:18,880
The road had steep places in it, and places here and there where
you could fall off and go bounding to the bottom among stones.

1022
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,720
But Buck, for some reason, did not think these opportunities
good enough for him.

1023
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,560
He selected a more theatrical moment.

1024
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:29,520
We emerged from a narrow canyon suddenly upon five hundred
cattle and some cowboys branding calves by a fire in a corral.

1025
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,040
It was a sight that Buck knew by heart.

1026
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,160
He instantly treated it like an appalling phenomenon.

1027
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:41,600
I saw him kick seven ways; I saw Muggins kick five ways; our
furious motion snapped my spine like a whip.

1028
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,280
I grasped the seat.

1029
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,960
Something gave a forlorn jingle.

1030
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,160
It was the brake.

1031
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,120
“Don’t jump!” commanded the trustworthy man.

1032
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,400
“No,” I said, as my hat flew off.

1033
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,480
Help was too far away to do anything for us.

1034
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,600
We passed scatheless through a part of the cattle, I saw their
horns and backs go by.

1035
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:07,680
Some earth crumbled, and we plunged downward into water rocking
among stones, and upward again through some more crumbling earth.

1036
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:12,760
I heard a crash, and saw my trunk landing in the stream.

1037
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,800
“She’s safer there,” said the trustworthy man.

1038
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,360
“True,” I said.

1039
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:22,720
“We’ll go back for her,” said he, with his eye on the horses
and his foot on the crippled brake.

1040
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,520
A dry gully was coming, and no room to turn.

1041
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,600
The farther side of it was terraced with rock.

1042
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:34,000
We should simply fall backward, if we did not fall forward first.


1043
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:44,080
He steered the horses straight over, and just at the bottom swung
them, with astonishing skill, to the right along the hard-baked mud.

1044
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:49,960
They took us along the bed up to the head of the gully, and through
a thicket of quaking asps.

1045
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:56,480
The light trees bent beneath our charge and bastinadoed the wagon
as it went over them.

1046
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:03,800
But their branches enmeshed the horses’ legs, and we came to
a harmless standstill among a bower of leaves.

1047
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,920
I looked at the trustworthy man, and smiled vaguely.

1048
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,160
He considered me for a moment.

1049
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:15,760
“I reckon,” said he, “you’re feelin’ about halfway between ‘Oh,
Lord!’ and ‘Thank God!’ ”

1050
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,960
“That’s quite it,” said I, as he got down on the ground.

1051
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,160
“Nothing’s broke,” said he, after a searching examination.

1052
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:26,680
And he indulged in a true Virginian expletive.

1053
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:35,640
“Gentlemen, hush!” he murmured gently, looking at me with his
grave eyes; “one time I got pretty near scared.

1054
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:41,320
You, Buck,” he continued, “some folks would beat you now till
yu’d be uncertain whether yu’ was a hawss or a railroad accident.

1055
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:45,000
I’d do it myself, only it wouldn’t cure yu’.”

1056
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,360
I now told him that I supposed he had saved both our lives.

1057
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,800
But he detested words of direct praise.

1058
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,240
He made some grumbling rejoinder, and led the horses out of the
thicket.

1059
01:25:56,240 --> 01:26:02,320
Buck, he explained to me, was a good horse, and so was Muggins.


1060
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,840
Both of them generally meant well, and that

1061
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:07,800
was the Judge’s reason for sending them to meet me.

1062
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,640
But these broncos had their off days.

1063
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:17,920
Off days might not come very often; but when the humor seized
a bronco, he had to have his spree.

1064
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:25,640
Buck would now behave himself as a horse should for probably
two months.

1065
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:31,480
“They are just like humans,” the Virginian concluded.

1066
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:37,440
Several cowboys arrived on a gallop to find how many pieces of
us were left.

1067
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:47,280
We returned down the hill; and when we reached my trunk, it was
surprising to see the distance that our runaway had covered.

1068
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,480
My hat was also found, and we continued on our way.

1069
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:55,400
Buck and Muggins were patterns of discretion through the rest
of the mountains.

1070
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:05,200
I thought when we camped this night that it was strange Buck should be again
allowed to graze at large, instead of being tied to a rope while we slept.

1071
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,800
But this was my ignorance.

1072
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:13,560
With the hard work that he was gallantly doing, the horse needed
more pasture than a rope’s length would permit him to find.

1073
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:21,040
Therefore he went free, and in the morning gave us but little
trouble in catching him.

1074
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:30,280
We crossed a river in the forenoon, and far to the north of us
we saw the Bow Leg Mountains, pale in the bright sun.

1075
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:38,720
Sunk Creek flowed from their western side, and our two hundred
and sixty-three miles began to grow a small thing in my eyes.

1076
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:44,840
Buck and Muggins, I think, knew perfectly that tomorrow would
see them home.

1077
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,840
They recognized this region; and once they turned off at a fork
in the road.

1078
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,560
The Virginian pulled them back rather sharply.

1079
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,760
“Want to go back to Balaam’s?” he inquired of them.

1080
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,120
“I thought you had more sense.”

1081
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,840
I asked, “Who was Balaam?”

1082
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:04,440
“A maltreater of hawsses,” replied the cowpuncher.

1083
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:09,000
“His ranch is on Butte Creek oveh yondeh.”

1084
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,160
And he pointed to where the diverging road melted into space.


1085
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:20,280
“The Judge bought Buck and Muggins from him in the spring.”

1086
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:22,960
“So he maltreats horses?” I repeated.

1087
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,000
“That’s the word all through this country.

1088
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,920
A man that will do what they claim Balaam does to a hawss when
he’s mad, ain’t fit to be called human.”

1089
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,680
The Virginian told me some particulars.

1090
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,240
“Oh!”

1091
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,040
I almost screamed at the horror of it, and again, “Oh!”

1092
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:45,200
“He’d have prob’ly done that to Buck as soon as he stopped runnin’
away. If I caught a man doin’ that⁠—”

1093
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:52,000
We were interrupted by a sedate-looking traveller riding upon
an equally sober horse.

1094
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,800
“Mawnin’, Taylor,” said the Virginian, pulling up for gossip.


1095
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,000
“Ain’t you strayed off your range pretty far?”

1096
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,480
“You’re a nice one!” replied Mr. Taylor, stopping his horse and
smiling amiably.

1097
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,760
“Tell me something I don’t know,” retorted the Virginian.

1098
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,720
“Hold up a man at cards and rob him,” pursued Mr. Taylor.

1099
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:17,000
“Oh, the news has got ahead of you!”

1100
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,360
“Trampas has been hyeh explainin’, has he?” said the Virginian
with a grin.

1101
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:26,120
“Was that your victim’s name?” said Mr. Taylor, facetiously.

1102
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:31,560
“No, it wasn’t him that brought the news. Say, what did you do,
anyway?”

1103
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,400
“So that thing has got around,” murmured the Virginian.

1104
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,000
“Well, it wasn’t worth such wide repawtin’.”

1105
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,320
And he gave the simple facts to Taylor, while I sat wondering
at the contagious powers of Rumor.

1106
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:48,080
Here, through this voiceless land, this desert, this vacuum,
it had spread like a change of weather.

1107
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,680
“Any news up your way?” the Virginian concluded.

1108
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:55,000
Importance came into Mr. Taylor’s countenance.

1109
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,680
“Bear Creek is going to build a schoolhouse,” said he.

1110
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,760
“Goodness gracious!” drawled the Virginian.

1111
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,760
“What’s that for?”

1112
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,120
Now Mr. Taylor had been married for some years.

1113
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,880
“To educate the offspring of Bear Creek,” he answered with pride.


1114
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,400
“Offspring of Bear Creek,” the Virginian meditatively repeated.


1115
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:18,160
“I don’t remember noticin’ much offspring. There was some white
tail deer, and a right smart o’ jack rabbits.”

1116
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:22,200
“The Swintons have moved up from Drybone,” said Mr. Taylor, always
seriously.

1117
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,280
“They found it no place for young children.

1118
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,800
And there’s Uncle Carmody with six, and Ben Dow.

1119
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,600
And Westfall has become a family man, and⁠—”

1120
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,360
“Jim Westfall!” exclaimed the Virginian.

1121
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,600
“Him a fam’ly man!

1122
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:41,280
Well, if this hyeh Territory is goin’ to get full o’ fam’ly men
and empty o’ game, I believe I’ll⁠—”

1123
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,480
“Get married yourself,” suggested Mr. Taylor.

1124
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,840
“Me! I ain’t near reached the marriageable age. No, seh! But
Uncle Hughey has got there at last, yu’ know.”

1125
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,760
“Uncle Hughey!” shouted Mr. Taylor.

1126
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,840
He had not heard this.

1127
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,880
Rumor is very capricious.

1128
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,120
Therefore the Virginian told him, and the family man rocked in
his saddle.

1129
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,120
“Build your schoolhouse,” said the Virginian.

1130
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:08,040
“Uncle Hughey has qualified himself to subscribe to all such
propositions. Got your eye on a schoolmarm?”

1131
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:08,440
CHAPTER V

1132
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,160
Enter the Woman

1133
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,800
“We are taking steps,” said Mr. Taylor.

1134
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,320
“Bear Creek ain’t going to be hasty about a schoolmarm.”

1135
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,880
“Sure,” assented the Virginian.

1136
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,840
“The children wouldn’t want yu’ to hurry.”

1137
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,640
But Mr. Taylor was, as I have indicated, a serious family man.


1138
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,640
The problem of educating his children could appear to him in
no light except a sober one.

1139
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,680
“Bear Creek,” he said, “don’t want the experience they had over
at Calef.

1140
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,480
We must not hire an ignoramus.”

1141
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,360
“Sure!” assented the Virginian again.

1142
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:39,600
“Nor we don’t want no gad-a-way flirt,” said Mr. Taylor.

1143
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,040
“She must keep her eyes on the blackboa’d,” said the Virginian,
gently.

1144
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:52,840
“Well, we can wait till we get a guaranteed article,” said Mr.
Taylor.

1145
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,040
“And that’s what we’re going to do.

1146
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,840
It can’t be this year, and it needn’t to be.

1147
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:05,440
None of the kids is very old, and the schoolhouse has got to
be built.”

1148
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,880
He now drew a letter from his pocket, and looked at me.

1149
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:12,600
“Are you acquainted with Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington,
Vermont?” he inquired.

1150
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,320
I was not acquainted with her at this time.

1151
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,760
“She’s one we are thinking of. She’s a correspondent with Mrs.
Balaam.”

1152
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,680
Taylor handed me the letter.

1153
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:31,680
“She wrote that to Mrs. Balaam, and Mrs. Balaam said the best
thing was for to let me see it and judge for myself.

1154
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,760
I’m taking it back to Mrs. Balaam.

1155
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:40,120
Maybe you can give me your opinion how it sizes up with the letters
they write back East?”

1156
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,120
The communication was mainly of a business kind, but also personal,
and freely written.

1157
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:49,040
I do not think that its writer expected it to be exhibited as
a document.

1158
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,880
The writer wished very much that she could see the West.

1159
01:32:52,880 --> 01:33:02,120
But she could not gratify this desire merely for pleasure, or she would
long ago have accepted the kind invitation to visit Mrs. Balaam’s ranch.

1160
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:08,520
Teaching school was something she would like to do, if she were
fitted for it.

1161
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:17,600
“Since the mills failed” (the writer said) “we have all gone to work and
done a lot of things so that mother might keep on living in the old house.

1162
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,080
Yes, the salary would be a temptation.

1163
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,240
But, my dear, isn’t Wyoming bad for the complexion?

1164
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,520
And could I sue them if mine got damaged?

1165
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,480
It is still admired.

1166
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:35,280
I could bring one male witness at least to prove that!”

1167
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,520
Then the writer became businesslike again.

1168
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,880
Even if she came to feel that she could leave home, she did not
at all know that she could teach school.

1169
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:47,920
Nor did she think it right to accept a position in which one
had had no experience.

1170
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:52,000
“I do love children, boys especially,” she went on.

1171
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,200
“My small nephew and I get on famously.

1172
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:00,800
But imagine if a whole benchful of boys began asking me questions
that I couldn’t answer!

1173
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,600
What should I do?

1174
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,840
For one could not spank them all, you know!

1175
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:12,840
And mother says that I ought not to teach anybody spelling, because
I leave the u out of ‘honor.’”

1176
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:21,240
Altogether it was a letter which I could assure Mr. Taylor “sized up”
very well with the letters written in my part of the United States.

1177
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,080
And it was signed, “Your very sincere spinster, Molly Stark Wood.”


1178
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:32,680
“I never seen ‘honor’ spelled with a u,” said Mr. Taylor, over whose not
highly civilized head certain portions of the letter had lightly passed.

1179
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,240
I told him that some old-fashioned people still wrote the word
so.

1180
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,600
“Either way would satisfy Bear Creek,” said Mr. Taylor, “if she’s
otherwise up to requirements.”

1181
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,360
The Virginian was now looking over the letter musingly, and with
awakened attention.

1182
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,120
“ ‘Your very sincere spinster,’ ” he read aloud slowly.

1183
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:53,280
“I guess that means she’s forty,” said Taylor.

1184
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,360
“I reckon she is about twenty,” said the Virginian.

1185
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,440
And again he fell to musing over the paper that he held.

1186
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:05,080
“Her handwriting ain’t like any I’ve saw,” pursued Mr. Taylor.


1187
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:16,640
“But Bear Creek would not object to that, provided she knows
’rithmetic and George Washington, and them kind of things.”

1188
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:25,800
“I expect she is not an awful sincere spinster,” surmised the Virginian,
still looking at the letter, still holding it as if it were some token.

1189
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,160
Has any botanist set down what the seed of love is?

1190
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,440
Has it anywhere been set down in how many ways this seed may
be sown?

1191
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:41,760
In what various vessels of gossamer it can float across wide spaces? Or upon what
different soils it can fall, and live unknown, and bide its time for blooming?

1192
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:48,760
The Virginian handed back to Taylor the sheet of note paper
where a girl had talked as the women he had known did not talk.

1193
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:59,120
If his eyes had ever seen such maidens, there had been no meeting of eyes; and if
such maidens had ever spoken to him, the speech was from an established distance.

1194
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:03,000
But here was a free language, altogether new to him.

1195
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:10,520
It proved, however, not alien to his understanding, as it was
alien to Mr. Taylor’s.

1196
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,760
We drove onward, a mile perhaps, and then two.

1197
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,760
He had lately been full of words, but now he barely answered
me, so that a silence fell upon both of us.

1198
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:26,240
It must have been all of ten miles that we had driven when he
spoke of his own accord.

1199
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:32,680
“Your real spinster don’t speak of her lot that easy,” he remarked.


1200
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:43,920
And presently he quoted a phrase about the complexion, “ ‘Could I sue them if
mine got damaged?’ ” and he smiled over this to himself, shaking his head.

1201
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,560
“What would she be doing on Bear Creek?” he next said.

1202
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,080
And finally: “I reckon that witness will detain her in Vermont.


1203
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,040
And her mother’ll keep livin’ at the old house

1204
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:54,280
.”

1205
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:02,440
Thus did the cowpuncher deliver himself, not knowing at all that the seed
had floated across wide spaces, and was biding its time in his heart.

1206
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,240
On the morrow we reached Sunk Creek.

1207
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:15,000
Judge Henry’s welcome and his wife’s would have obliterated any
hardships that I had endured, and I had endured none at all.

1208
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,720
For a while I saw little of the Virginian.

1209
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:28,080
He lapsed into his native way of addressing me occasionally as
“seh”⁠—a habit entirely repudiated by this land of equality.

1210
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,120
I was sorry.

1211
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:36,720
Our common peril during the runaway of Buck and Muggins had
brought us to a familiarity that I hoped was destined to last.

1212
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:46,240
But I think that it would not have gone farther, save for a certain
personage⁠—I must call her a personage.

1213
01:37:46,240 --> 01:38:13,680
And as I am indebted to her for gaining me a friend whose prejudice against me might never have been otherwise overcome, I shall tell
you her little story, and how her misadventures and her fate came to bring the Virginian and me to an appreciation of one another.

1214
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:23,440
Without her, it is likely I should also not have heard so much of the
story of the schoolmarm, and how that lady at last came to Bear Creek.

1215
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,360
CHAPTER VI

1216
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:25,760
Em’ly

1217
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,160
My personage was a hen, and she lived at the Sunk Creek Ranch.


1218
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:34,920
Judge Henry’s ranch was notable for several luxuries.

1219
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,520
He had milk, for example.

1220
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:44,880
In those days his brother ranchmen had thousands of cattle very
often, but not a drop of milk, save the condensed variety.

1221
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,240
Therefore they had no butter.

1222
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,600
The Judge had plenty.

1223
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,040
Next rarest to butter and milk in the cattle country were eggs.


1224
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,280
But my host had chickens.

1225
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:05,400
Whether this was because he had followed cockfighting in his
early days, or whether it was due to Mrs. Henry, I cannot say.

1226
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:15,120
I only know that when I took a meal elsewhere, I was likely to find nothing but the eternal
“sowbelly,” beans, and coffee; while at Sunk Creek the omelet and the custard were frequent.

1227
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:20,280
The passing traveller was glad to tie his horse to the fence
here, and sit down to the Judge’s table.

1228
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:23,080
For its fame was as wide as Wyoming.

1229
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:27,040
It was an oasis in the Territory’s desolate bill-of-fare.

1230
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:36,760
The long fences of Judge Henry’s home ranch began upon Sunk Creek
soon after that stream emerged from its canyon through the Bow Leg.

1231
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:41,480
It was a place always well cared for by the owner, even in the
days of his bachelorhood.

1232
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:54,000
The placid regiments of cattle lay in the cool of the cottonwoods by the water, or slowly moved among
the sagebrush, feeding upon the grass that in those forever departed years was plentiful and tall.

1233
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:18,320
The steers came fat off his unenclosed range and fattened still more in his large pasture; while his small pasture, a field some eight miles square, was for several
seasons given to the Judge’s horses, and over this ample space there played and prospered the good colts which he raised from Paladin, his imported stallion.

1234
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:27,640
After he married, I have been assured that his wife’s influence
became visible in and about the house at once.

1235
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:36,120
Shade trees were planted, flowers attempted, and to the chickens
was added the much more troublesome turkey.

1236
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:42,080
I, the visitor, was pressed into service when I arrived, green
from the East.

1237
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:51,880
I took hold of the farmyard and began building a better chicken house, while
the Judge was off creating meadow land in his gray and yellow wilderness.

1238
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:59,080
When any cowboy was unoccupied, he would lounge over to my neighborhood,
and silently regard my carpentering.

1239
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,960
Those cowpunchers bore names of various denominations.

1240
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,120
There was Honey Wiggin; there was Nebrasky, and Dollar Bill,
and Chalkeye.

1241
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:11,080
And they came from farms and cities, from Maine and from California.


1242
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:22,920
But the romance of American adventure had drawn them all alike to this great playground of young men, and
in their courage, their generosity, and their amusement at me they bore a close resemblance to each other.

1243
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,720
Each one would silently observe my achievements with the hammer
and the chisel.

1244
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,840
Then he would retire to the bunk-house, and presently I would
overhear laughter.

1245
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,320
But this was only in the morning.

1246
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:43,680
In the afternoon on many days of the summer which I spent at the Sunk Creek Ranch I would go shooting,
or ride up toward the entrance of the canyon and watch the men working on the irrigation ditches.

1247
01:41:43,680 --> 01:42:08,040
Pleasant systems of water running in channels were being led through the soil, and there was a sound of rippling here and there among the yellow grain; the green thick alfalfa grass waved almost, it seemed, of its own accord,
for the wind never blew; and when at evening the sun lay against the plain, the rift of the canyon was filled with a violet light, and the Bow Leg Mountains became transfigured with hues of floating and unimaginable color.

1248
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:13,560
The sun shone in a sky where never a cloud came, and noon was
not too warm nor the dark too cool.

1249
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:24,880
And so for two months I went through these pleasant uneventful days, improving the chickens,
an object of mirth, living in the open air, and basking in the perfection of content.

1250
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,360
I was justly styled a tenderfoot.

1251
01:42:27,360 --> 01:43:12,280
Mrs. Henry had in the beginning endeavored to shield me from this humiliation; but when she found that I was inveterate in laying my inexperience of Western matters bare to all the world, begging to be enlightened upon rattlesnakes, prairie-dogs, owls, blue and willow grouse, sage-hens, how to rope a horse or tighten the front cinch of my saddle,
and that my spirit soared into enthusiasm at the mere sight of so ordinary an animal as a white-tailed deer, she let me rush about with my firearms and made no further effort to stave off the ridicule that my blunders perpetually earned from the ranch hands, her own humorous husband, and any chance visitor who stopped for a meal or stayed the night.

1252
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:19,520
I was not called by my name after the first feeble etiquette
due to a stranger in his first few hours had died away.

1253
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,240
I was known simply as “the tenderfoot.”

1254
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:27,200
I was introduced to the neighborhood (a circle of eighty miles)
as “the tenderfoot.”

1255
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:33,120
It was thus that Balaam, the maltreater of horses, learned to
address me when he came a two days’ journey to pay a visit.

1256
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:41,400
And it was this name and my notorious helplessness that bid fair
to end what relations I had with the Virginian.

1257
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:59,560
For when Judge Henry ascertained that nothing could prevent me from losing myself, that it was not uncommon for me to
saunter out after breakfast with a gun and in thirty minutes cease to know north from south, he arranged for my protection.

1258
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:04,880
He detailed an escort for me; and the escort was once more the
trustworthy man!

1259
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,560
The poor Virginian was taken from his work and his comrades and
set to playing nurse for me.

1260
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:14,240
And for a while this humiliation ate into his untamed soul.

1261
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:23,240
It was his lugubrious lot to accompany me in my rambles, preside over
my blunders, and save me from calamitously passing into the next world.

1262
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:28,280
He bore it in courteous silence, except when speaking was necessary.


1263
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:37,400
He would show me the lower ford, which I could never find for
myself, generally mistaking a quicksand for it.

1264
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,520
He would tie my horse properly.

1265
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:50,800
He would recommend me not to shoot my rifle at a white-tailed deer in the particular moment
that the outfit wagon was passing behind the animal on the further side of the brush.

1266
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:59,280
There was seldom a day that he was not obliged to hasten and
save me from sudden death or from ridicule, which is worse.

1267
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:26,000
Yet never once did he lose his patience and his gentle, slow voice, and apparently lazy manner remained the same, whether we were sitting at lunch together, or up in the
mountain during a hunt, or whether he was bringing me back my horse, which had run away because I had again forgotten to throw the reins over his head and let them trail.

1268
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,360
“He’ll always stand if yu’ do that,” the Virginian would say.


1269
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,400
“See how my hawss stays right quiet yondeh.”

1270
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,560
After such admonition he would say no more to me.

1271
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,040
But this tame nursery business was assuredly gall to him.

1272
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:57,600
For though utterly a man in countenance and in his self-possession and incapacity to be put at a loss, he was
still boyishly proud of his wild calling, and wore his leather straps and jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure.

1273
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:11,160
His tiger limberness and his beauty were rich with unabated youth; and that force
which lurked beneath his surface must often have curbed his intolerance of me.

1274
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:23,800
In spite of what I knew must be his opinion of me, the tenderfoot, my liking
for him grew, and I found his silent company more and more agreeable.

1275
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:28,960
That he had spells of talking, I had already learned at Medicine
Bow.

1276
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:42,520
But his present taciturnity might almost have effaced this impression, had I not happened to pass by the
bunk-house one evening after dark, when Honey Wiggin and the rest of the cowboys were gathered inside it.

1277
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:46,360
That afternoon the Virginian and I had gone duck shooting.

1278
01:46:46,360 --> 01:47:02,480
We had found several in a beaver dam, and I had killed two as they sat close together; but they floated against the
breastwork of sticks out in the water some four feet deep, where the escaping current might carry them down the stream.

1279
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,680
The Judge’s red setter had not accompanied us, because she was
expecting a family.

1280
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:11,960
“We don’t want her along anyways,” the cowpuncher had explained
to me.

1281
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:21,120
“She runs around mighty irresponsible, and she’ll stand a prairie-dog
’bout as often as she’ll stand a bird.

1282
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:23,640
She’s a triflin’ animal.”

1283
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:33,400
My anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with all my
clothes on, and subsequently crawl out a slippery, triumphant, weltering heap.

1284
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:41,320
The Virginian’s serious eyes had rested upon this spectacle of
mud; but he expressed nothing, as usual.

1285
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:46,360
“They ain’t overly good eatin’,” he observed, tying the birds
to his saddle.

1286
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,160
“They’re divers.”

1287
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,520
“Divers!” I exclaimed.

1288
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,200
“Why didn’t they dive?”

1289
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:56,040
“I reckon they was young ones and hadn’t experience.”

1290
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:03,560
“Well,” I said, crestfallen, but attempting to be humorous, “I
did the diving myself.”

1291
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,760
But the Virginian made no comment.

1292
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:18,600
He handed me my double-barrelled English gun, which I was about to leave deserted on the ground behind me, and
we rode home in our usual silence, the mean little white-breasted, sharp-billed divers dangling from his saddle.

1293
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,160
It was in the bunk-house that he took his revenge.

1294
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:37,840
As I passed I heard his gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive audience, and just as I came by the open window where he sat on his
bed in shirt and drawers, his back to me, I heard his concluding words, “And the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu’ he weren’t a snappin’-turtle.”

1295
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:44,760
The anecdote met with instantaneous success, and I hurried away
into the dark.

1296
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,960
The next morning I was occupied with the chickens.

1297
01:48:46,960 --> 01:49:03,320
Two hens were fighting to sit on some eggs that a third was daily laying, and which I did not want hatched, and for the third time
I had kicked Em’ly off seven potatoes she had rolled together and was determined to raise I know not what sort of family from.

1298
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:11,800
She was shrieking about the henhouse as the Virginian came in to observe (I suspect)
what I might be doing now that could be useful for him to mention in the bunk-house.

1299
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:17,600
He stood awhile, and at length said, “We lost our best rooster
when Mrs. Henry came to live hyeh.”

1300
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:18,280
I paid no attention.

1301
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,880
“He was a right elegant Dominicker,” he continued.

1302
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:28,080
I felt a little riled about the snapping-turtle, and showed no interest
in what he was saying, but continued my functions among the hens.

1303
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,720
This unusual silence of mine seemed to elicit unusual speech
from him.

1304
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:40,760
“Yu’ see, that rooster he’d always lived round hyeh when the Judge was a
bachelor, and he never seen no ladies or any persons wearing female gyarments.

1305
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:44,080
You ain’t got rheumatism, seh?”

1306
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,240
“Me? No.”

1307
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,840
“I reckoned maybe them little odd divers yu’ got damp goin’ afteh⁠—”


1308
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:50,080
He paused.

1309
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,480
“Oh, no, not in the least, thank you.”

1310
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:57,280
“Yu’ seemed sort o’ grave this mawnin’, and I’m cert’nly glad
it ain’t them divers.”

1311
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,320
“Well, the rooster?” I inquired finally.

1312
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:00,880
“Oh, him!

1313
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,240
He weren’t raised where he could see petticoats.

1314
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:08,040
Mrs. Henry she come hyeh from the railroad with the Judge afteh
dark.

1315
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:13,960
Next mawnin’ early she walked out to view her new home, and the
rooster was a-feedin’ by the door, and he seen her.

1316
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:23,440
Well, seh, he screeched that awful I run out of the bunk-house; and he jus’
went over the fence and took down Sunk Creek shoutin’ fire, right along.

1317
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,400
He has never come back.”

1318
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:29,840
“There’s a hen over there now that has no judgment,” I said,
indicating Em’ly.

1319
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:37,040
She had got herself outside the house, and was on the bars of
a corral, her vociferations reduced to an occasional squawk.

1320
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,720
I told him about the potatoes.

1321
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,480
“I never knowed her name before,” said he.

1322
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:49,880
“That runaway rooster, he hated her. And she hated him same as
she hates ’em all.”

1323
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:56,000
“I named her myself,” said I, “after I came to notice her particularly.


1324
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:08,560
There’s an old maid at home who’s charitable, and belongs to the Cruelty to Animals,
and she never knows whether she had better cross in front of a street car or wait.

1325
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,600
I named the hen after her.

1326
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,320
Does she ever lay eggs?”

1327
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:16,080
The Virginian had not “troubled his haid” over the poultry.

1328
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,800
“Well, I don’t believe she knows how. I think she came near being
a rooster.”

1329
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,240
“She’s sure manly-lookin’,” said the Virginian.

1330
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:27,520
We had walked toward the corral, and he was now scrutinizing
Em’ly with interest.

1331
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,640
She was an egregious fowl.

1332
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:34,320
She was huge and gaunt, with great yellow beak, and she stood
straight and alert in the manner of responsible people.

1333
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,720
There was something wrong with her tail.

1334
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:41,680
It slanted far to one side, one feather in it twice as long as
the rest.

1335
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:44,200
Feathers on her breast there were none.

1336
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:49,680
These had been worn entirely off by her habit of sitting upon
potatoes and other rough abnormal objects.

1337
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:54,560
And this lent to her appearance an air of being décollete, singularly
at variance with her otherwise prudish ensemble.

1338
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:58,360
Her eye was remarkably bright, but somehow it had an outraged
expression.

1339
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:04,640
It was as if she went about the world perpetually scandalized
over the doings that fell beneath her notice.

1340
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:09,120
Her legs were blue, long, and remarkably stout.

1341
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:13,000
“She’d ought to wear knickerbockers,” murmured the Virginian.


1342
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:20,280
“She’d look a heap better ’n some o’ them college students. And
she’ll set on potatoes, yu’ say?”

1343
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,440
“She thinks she can hatch out anything.

1344
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:28,680
I’ve found her with onions, and last Tuesday I caught her on
two balls of soap.”

1345
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:32,280
In the afternoon the tall cowpuncher and I rode out to get an
antelope.

1346
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:42,280
After an hour, during which he was completely taciturn, he said: “I reckon
maybe this hyeh lonesome country ain’t been healthy for Em’ly to live in.

1347
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:44,000
It ain’t for some humans.

1348
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:52,880
Them old trappers in the mountains gets skewed in the haid mighty
often, an’ talks out loud when nobody’s nigher ’n a hundred miles.”

1349
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,600
“Em’ly has not been solitary,” I replied.

1350
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,840
“There are forty chickens here.”

1351
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,320
“That’s so,” said he.

1352
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,480
“It don’t explain her.”

1353
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,320
He fell silent again, riding beside me, easy and indolent in
the saddle.

1354
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:14,600
His long figure looked so loose and inert that the swift, light
spring he made to the ground seemed an impossible feat.

1355
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,080
He had seen an antelope where I saw none.

1356
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:23,720
“Take a shot yourself,” I urged him, as he motioned me to be
quick.

1357
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:26,560
“You never shoot when I’m with you.”

1358
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,840
“I ain’t hyeh for that,” he answered.

1359
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,600
“Now you’ve let him get away on yu’!”

1360
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,560
The antelope had in truth departed.

1361
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:40,520
“Why,” he said to my protest, “I can hit them things any day.


1362
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:43,600
What’s your notion as to Em’ly?”

1363
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:45,680
“I can’t account for her,” I replied.

1364
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:52,440
“Well,” he said musingly, and then his mind took one of those
particular turns that made me love him, “Taylor ought to see her.

1365
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,800
She’d be just the schoolmarm for Bear Creek!”

1366
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,040
“She’s not much like the eating-house lady at Medicine Bow,”
I said.

1367
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:57,880
He gave a hilarious chuckle.

1368
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,960
“No, Em’ly knows nothing o’ them joys.

1369
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:02,080
So yu’ have no notion about her?

1370
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,200
Well, I’ve got one.

1371
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:06,680
I reckon maybe she was hatched after a big thunderstorm.”

1372
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:09,080
“In a big thunderstorm!” I exclaimed.

1373
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,440
“Yes.

1374
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:13,040
Don’t yu’ know about them, and what they’ll do to aiggs?

1375
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,840
A big case o’ lightnin’ and thunder will addle aiggs and keep
’em from hatchin’.

1376
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:29,000
And I expect one came along, and all the other aiggs of Em’ly’s set didn’t hatch out, but got plumb
addled, and she happened not to get addled that far, and so she just managed to make it through.

1377
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,200
But she cert’nly ain’t got a strong haid.”

1378
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,240
“I fear she has not,” said I.

1379
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:38,080
“Mighty hon’ble intentions,” he observed.

1380
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:44,840
“If she can’t make out to lay anything, she wants to hatch somethin’,
and be a mother anyways.”

1381
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:52,400
“I wonder what relation the law considers that a hen is to the
chicken she hatched but did not lay?” I inquired.

1382
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,960
The Virginian made no reply to this frivolous suggestion.

1383
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,400
He was gazing over the wide landscape gravely and with apparent
inattention.

1384
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:09,920
He invariably saw game before I did, and was off his horse and crouched
among the sage while I was still getting my left foot clear of the stirrup.

1385
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:15,760
I succeeded in killing an antelope, and we rode home with the
head and hind quarters.

1386
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:16,920
“No,” said he.

1387
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:24,080
“It’s sure the thunder, and not the lonesomeness. How do yu’
like the lonesomeness yourself?”

1388
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:25,760
I told him that I liked it.

1389
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,400
“I could not live without it now,” he said.

1390
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:32,720
“This has got into my system.”

1391
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,160
He swept his hand out at the vast space of world.

1392
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,800
“I went back home to see my folks onced.

1393
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:39,840
Mother was dyin’ slow, and she wanted me.

1394
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,200
I stayed a year.

1395
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,040
But them Virginia mountains could please me no more.

1396
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:48,080
Afteh she was gone, I told my brothers and sisters goodbye.

1397
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:52,440
We like each other well enough, but I reckon I’ll not go back.”


1398
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:59,720
We found Em’ly seated upon a collection of green California peaches,
which the Judge had brought from the railroad.

1399
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:03,600
“I don’t mind her any more,” I said; “I’m sorry for her.”

1400
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,720
“I’ve been sorry for her right along,” said the Virginian.

1401
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,600
“She does hate the roosters so.”

1402
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:16,840
And he said that he was making a collection of every class of
object which he found her treating as eggs.

1403
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:26,280
But Em’ly’s egg-industry was terminated abruptly one morning,
and her unquestioned energies diverted to a new channel.

1404
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:34,440
A turkey which had been sitting in the root-house appeared with twelve
children, and a family of bantams occurred almost simultaneously.

1405
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:43,160
Em’ly was importantly scratching the soil inside Paladin’s corral when the bantam tribe
of newly born came by down the lane, and she caught sight of them through the bars.

1406
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:48,840
She crossed the corral at a run, and intercepted two of the chicks
that were trailing somewhat behind their real mamma.

1407
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:54,960
These she undertook to appropriate, and assumed a high tone with the bantam, who
was the smaller, and hence obliged to retreat with her still numerous family.

1408
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,960
I interfered, and put matters straight; but the adjustment was
only temporary.

1409
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:06,680
In an hour I saw Em’ly immensely busy with two more bantams, leading them
about and taking a care of them which I must admit seemed perfectly efficient.

1410
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:11,000
And now came the first incident that made me suspect her to be
demented.

1411
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:21,240
She had proceeded with her changelings behind the kitchen, where one of the irrigation
ditches ran under the fence from the hayfield to supply the house with water.

1412
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:27,880
Some distance along this ditch inside the field were the twelve
turkeys in the short, recently cut stubble.

1413
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,960
Again Em’ly set off instantly like a deer.

1414
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,200
She left the dismayed bantams behind her.

1415
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:46,840
She crossed the ditch with one jump of her stout blue legs, flew over the grass, and was at once among the turkeys,
where, with an instinct of maternity as undiscriminating as it was reckless, she attempted to huddle some of them away.

1416
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:55,160
But this other mamma was not a bantam, and in a few moments Em’ly was
entirely routed in her attempt to acquire a new variety of family.

1417
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:58,320
This spectacle was witnessed by the Virginian and myself, and
it overcame him.

1418
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:06,680
He went speechless across to the bunk-house, by himself, and sat on
his bed, while I took the abandoned bantams back to their own circle.

1419
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:09,560
I have often wondered what the other fowls thought of all this.


1420
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:12,440
Some impression it certainly did make upon them.

1421
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:28,640
The notion may seem out of reason to those who have never closely attended to other animals than man; but I am convinced that any community which
shares some of our instincts will share some of the resulting feelings, and that birds and beasts have conventions, the breach of which startles them.

1422
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:31,560
If there be anything in evolution, this would seem inevitable.


1423
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:35,720
At all events, the chicken-house was upset during the following
several days.

1424
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:46,880
Em’ly disturbed now the bantams and now the turkeys, and several of these latter had died,
though I will not go so far as to say that this was the result of her misplaced attentions.

1425
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:56,280
Nevertheless, I was seriously thinking of locking her up till the broods should
be a little older, when another event happened, and all was suddenly at peace.

1426
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,240
The Judge’s setter came in one morning, wagging her tail.

1427
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:05,480
She had had her puppies, and she now took us to where they were
housed, in between the floor of a building and the hollow ground.

1428
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,640
Em’ly was seated on the whole litter.

1429
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:12,320
“No,” I said to the Judge, “I am not surprised.

1430
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,360
She is capable of anything.”

1431
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:18,880
In her new choice of offspring, this hen had at length encountered
an unworthy parent.

1432
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,280
The setter was bored by her own puppies.

1433
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:33,320
She found the hole under the house an obscure and monotonous residence compared with the
dining room, and our company more stimulating and sympathetic than that of her children.

1434
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:49,800
A much-petted contact with our superior race had developed her dog intelligence above its natural level, and
turned her into an unnatural, neglectful mother, who was constantly forgetting her nursery for worldly pleasures.

1435
01:59:49,800 --> 02:00:01,640
At certain periods of the day she repaired to the puppies and fed them, but came away when this
perfunctory ceremony was accomplished; and she was glad enough to have a governess bring them up.

1436
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:06,400
She made no quarrel with Em’ly, and the two understood each other
perfectly.

1437
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:11,160
I have never seen among animals any arrangement so civilized
and so perverted.

1438
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,520
It made Em’ly perfectly happy.

1439
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:29,200
To see her sitting all day jealously spreading her wings over some blind puppies was sufficiently curious; but when they became
large enough to come out from under the house and toddle about in the proud hen’s wake, I longed for some distinguished naturalist.

1440
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:33,800
I felt that our ignorance made us inappropriate spectators of
such a phenomenon.

1441
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:44,760
Em’ly scratched and clucked, and the puppies ran to her, pawed her with their fat
limp little legs, and retreated beneath her feathers in their games of hide and seek.

1442
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:50,320
Conceive, if you can, what confusion must have reigned in their
infant minds as to who the setter was!

1443
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,520
“I reckon they think she’s the wet-nurse,” said the Virginian.


1444
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:58,160
When the puppies grew to be boisterous, I perceived that Em’ly’s
mission was approaching its end.

1445
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:03,560
They were too heavy for her, and their increasing scope of playfulness
was not in her line.

1446
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:17,160
Once or twice they knocked her over, upon which she arose and pecked them severely,
and they retired to a safe distance, and sitting in a circle, yapped at her.

1447
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:22,360
I think they began to suspect that she was only a hen after all.


1448
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:31,080
So Em’ly resigned with an indifference which surprised me, until I remembered that
if it had been chickens, she would have ceased to look after them by this time.

1449
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:36,520
But here she was again “out of a job,” as the Virginian said.


1450
02:01:36,520 --> 02:01:46,720
“She’s raised them puppies for that triflin’ setter, and now she’ll be
huntin’ around for something else useful to do that ain’t in her business.”

1451
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:54,440
Now there were other broods of chickens to arrive in the henhouse,
and I did not desire any more bantam and turkey performances.

1452
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,160
So, to avoid confusion, I played a trick upon Em’ly.

1453
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:04,520
I went down to Sunk Creek and fetched some smooth, oval stones.


1454
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:12,680
She was quite satisfied with these, and passed a quiet day with
them in a box.

1455
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:15,320
This was not fair, the Virginian asserted.

1456
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:20,920
“You ain’t going to jus’ leave her fooled that a-way?”

1457
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:21,920
I did not see why not.

1458
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:25,040
“Why, she raised them puppies all right.

1459
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:28,560
Ain’t she showed she knows how to be a mother anyways?

1460
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,640
Em’ly ain’t going to get her time took up for nothing while I’m
round hyeh,” said the cowpuncher.

1461
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:37,280
He laid a gentle hold of Em’ly and tossed her to the ground.

1462
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,840
She, of course, rushed out among the corrals in a great state
of nerves.

1463
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,480
“I don’t see what good you do meddling,” I protested.

1464
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:50,560
To this he deigned no reply, but removed the unresponsive stones
from the straw.

1465
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,480
“Why, if they ain’t right warm!” he exclaimed plaintively.

1466
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:59,760
“The poor, deluded son-of-a-gun!”

1467
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:04,160
And with this unusual description of a lady, he sent the stones
sailing like a line of birds.

1468
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:08,400
“I’m regular getting stuck on Em’ly,” continued the Virginian.


1469
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,440
“Yu’ needn’t to laugh.

1470
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,040
Don’t yu’ see she’s got sort o’ human feelin’s and desires?

1471
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:17,880
I always knowed hawsses was like people, and my collie, of course.


1472
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:25,000
It is kind of foolish, I expect, but that hen’s goin’ to have
a real aigg directly, right now, to set on.”

1473
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,240
With this he removed one from beneath another hen.

1474
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:32,800
“We’ll have Em’ly raise this hyeh,” said he, “so she can put
in her time profitable.”

1475
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:43,800
It was not accomplished at once; for Em’ly, singularly enough,
would not consent to stay in the box whence she had been routed.

1476
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:55,560
At length we found another retreat for her, and in these new surroundings, with a new piece of work
for her to do, Em’ly sat on the one egg which the Virginian had so carefully provided for her.

1477
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:01,680
Thus, as in all genuine tragedies, was the stroke of Fate wrought
by chance and the best intentions.

1478
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,320
Em’ly began sitting on Friday afternoon near sundown.

1479
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:08,040
Early next morning my sleep was gradually dispersed by a sound
unearthly and continuous.

1480
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:20,920
Now it dwindled, receding to a distance; again it came near, took a turn, drifted to the other side
of the house; then, evidently, whatever it was, passed my door close, and I jumped upright in my bed.

1481
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:32,760
The high, tense strain of vibration, nearly, but not quite, a musical note, was like the
threatening scream of machinery, though weaker, and I bounded out of the house in my pajamas.

1482
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:39,200
There was Em’ly, dishevelled, walking wildly about, her one egg
miraculously hatched within ten hours.

1483
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:44,120
The little lonely yellow ball of down went cheeping along behind,
following its mother as best it could.

1484
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:49,200
What, then, had happened to the established period of incubation?


1485
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:57,240
For an instant the thing was like a portent, and I was near
joining Em’ly in her horrid surprise, when I saw how it all was.

1486
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:04,160
The Virginian had taken an egg from a hen which had already been
sitting for three weeks.

1487
02:05:04,160 --> 02:05:08,480
I dressed in haste, hearing Em’ly’s distracted outcry.

1488
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:17,480
It steadily sounded, without perceptible pause for breath, and marked
her erratic journey back and forth through stables, lanes, and corrals.

1489
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:26,080
The shrill disturbance brought all of us out to see her, and in the
henhouse I discovered the new brood making its appearance punctually.

1490
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:31,880
But this natural explanation could not be made to the crazed
hen.

1491
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:53,000
She continued to scour the premises, her slant tail and its one preposterous feather waving as she aimlessly went, her stout legs stepping high with an
unnatural motion, her head lifted nearly off her neck, and in her brilliant yellow eye an expression of more than outrage at this overturning of a natural law.

1492
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,720
Behind her, entirely ignored and neglected, trailed the little
progeny.

1493
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,840
She never looked at it.

1494
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:08,400
We went about our various affairs, and all through the clear,
sunny day that unending metallic scream pervaded the premises.

1495
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:14,080
The Virginian put out food and water for her, but she tasted
nothing.

1496
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:17,000
I am glad to say that the little chicken did.

1497
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:24,520
I do not think that the hen’s eyes could see, except in the way
that sleepwalkers’ do.

1498
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:29,040
The heat went out of the air, and in the canyon the violet light
began to show.

1499
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,400
Many hours had gone, but Em’ly never ceased.

1500
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:45,360
Now she suddenly flew up in a tree and sat there with her noise still going; but it had risen lately several notes into
a slim, acute level of terror, and was not like machinery any more, nor like any sound I ever heard before or since.

1501
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:52,760
Below the tree stood the bewildered little chicken, cheeping,
and making tiny jumps to reach its mother.

1502
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:57,560
“Yes,” said the Virginian, “it’s comical.

1503
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:01,040
Even her aigg acted different from anybody else’s.”

1504
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:07,960
He paused, and looked across the wide, mellowing plain with the
expression of easygoing gravity so common with him.

1505
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:12,600
Then he looked at Em’ly in the tree and the yellow chicken.

1506
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:17,400
“It ain’t so damned funny,” said he.

1507
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:22,680
We went in to supper, and I came out to find the hen lying on
the ground, dead.

1508
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:26,480
I took the chicken to the family in the henhouse.

1509
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,640
No, it was not altogether funny any more.

1510
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:39,480
And I did not think less of the Virginian when I came upon him
surreptitiously digging a little hole in the field for her.

1511
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:46,440
“I have buried some citizens here and there,” said he, “that
I have respected less.”

1512
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:54,680
And when the time came for me to leave Sunk Creek, my last word
to the Virginian was, “Don’t forget Em’ly.”

1513
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:57,040
“I ain’t likely to,” responded the cowpuncher.

1514
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:01,120
“She is just one o’ them parables.”

1515
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:14,880
Save when he fell into his native idioms (which, they told me, his wanderings had well-nigh obliterated until that year’s visit
to his home again revived them in his speech), he had now for a long while dropped the “seh,” and all other barriers between us.

1516
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:20,120
We were thorough friends, and had exchanged many confidences
both of the flesh and of the spirit.

1517
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:27,560
He even went the length of saying that he would write me the
Sunk Creek news if I would send him a line now and then.

1518
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:29,800
I have many letters from him now.

1519
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:35,520
Their spelling came to be faultless, and in the beginning was
little worse than George Washington’s.

1520
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:50,560
The Judge himself drove me to the railroad by another way⁠—across the Bow
Leg Mountains, and south through Balaam’s Ranch and Drybone to Rock Creek.

1521
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,360
“I’ll be very homesick,” I told him.

1522
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:59,000
“Come and pull the latchstring whenever you please,” he bade
me.

1523
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,080
I wished that I might!

1524
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:07,760
No lotus land ever cast its spell upon man’s heart more than
Wyoming had enchanted mine.

1525
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,440
CHAPTER VII

1526
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Through Two Snows

1527
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:16,000
Dear Friend [thus in the spring the Virginian wrote me], Yours
received.

1528
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,560
It must be a poor thing to be sick.

1529
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:26,600
That time I was shot at Cañada de Oro would have made me sick if
it had been a littel lower or if I was much of a drinking man.

1530
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:39,720
You will be well if you give over city life and take a hunt with me about
August or say September for then the elk will be out of the velvett.

1531
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:45,760
Things do not please me here just now and I am going to settel
it by vamosing.

1532
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,000
But I would be glad to see you.

1533
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,960
It would be pleasure not business for me to show you plenty elk
and get you strong.

1534
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:56,560
I am not crybabying to the Judge or making any kick about things.


1535
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,200
He will want me back after he has swallowed a litter tincture
of time.

1536
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:03,200
It is the best dose I know.

1537
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,800
Now to answer your questions.

1538
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,840
Yes the Emmily hen might have ate loco weed if hens do.

1539
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:13,400
I never saw anything but stock and horses get poisoned with loco
weed.

1540
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:16,320
No the school is not built yet.

1541
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:20,600
They are always big talkers on Bear Creek.

1542
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,800
No I have not seen Steve.

1543
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,520
He is around but I am sorry for him.

1544
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:27,200
Yes I have been to Medicine Bow.

1545
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,160
I had the welcom I wanted.

1546
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:33,160
Do you remember a man I played poker and he did not like it?

1547
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:36,240
He is working on the upper ranch near Ten Sleep.

1548
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:39,400
He does not amount to a thing except with weaklings.

1549
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,480
Uncle Hewie has twins.

1550
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:44,040
The boys got him vexed some about it, but I think they are his.


1551
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:50,200
Now that is all I know today and I would like to see you poco
presently as they say at Los Cruces.

1552
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:52,240
There’s no sense in you being sick.

1553
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:58,560
The rest of this letter discussed the best meeting point for
us should I decide to join him for a hunt.

1554
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:16,240
That hunt was made, and during the weeks of its duration something was said to explain a little more fully the
Virginian’s difficulty at the Sunk Creek Ranch, and his reason for leaving his excellent employer the Judge.

1555
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:26,720
Not much was said, to be sure; the Virginian seldom spent many
words upon his own troubles.

1556
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:41,240
But it appeared that owing to some jealousy of him on the part of the foreman, or the assistant foreman, he found himself
continually doing another man’s work, but under circumstances so skilfully arranged that he got neither credit nor pay for it.

1557
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:45,480
He would not stoop to telling tales out of school.

1558
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:52,080
Therefore his ready and prophetic mind devised the simple expedient
of going away altogether.

1559
02:11:52,080 --> 02:12:03,520
He calculated that Judge Henry would gradually perceive there was a
connection between his departure and the cessation of the satisfactory work.

1560
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:11,000
After a judicious interval it was his plan to appear again in
the neighborhood of Sunk Creek and await results.

1561
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,720
Concerning Steve he would say no more than he had written.

1562
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,040
But it was plain that for some cause this friendship had ceased.


1563
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:29,040
Money for his services during the hunt he positively declined to
accept, asserting that he had not worked enough to earn his board.

1564
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:43,520
And the expedition ended in an untravelled corner of the Yellowstone Park, near Pitchstone Canyon, where he
and young Lin McLean and others were witnesses of a sad and terrible drama that has been elsewhere chronicled.

1565
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:50,600
His prophetic mind had foreseen correctly the shape of events
at Sunk Creek.

1566
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:57,200
The only thing that it had not foreseen was the impression to
be made upon the Judge’s mind by his conduct.

1567
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:04,000
Toward the close of that winter, Judge and Mrs. Henry visited
the East.

1568
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,160
Through them a number of things became revealed.

1569
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:09,800
The Virginian was back at Sunk Creek.

1570
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:14,880
“And,” said Mrs. Henry, “he would never have left you if I had
had my way, Judge H.!”

1571
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,000
“No, Madam Judge,” retorted her husband; “I am aware of that.


1572
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,200
For you have always appreciated a fine appearance in a man.”

1573
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:24,960
“I certainly have,” confessed the lady, mirthfully.

1574
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:38,560
“And the way he used to come bringing my horse, with the ridges of his black hair so carefully brushed and that blue
spotted handkerchief tied so effectively round his throat, was something that I missed a great deal after he went away.”

1575
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:41,320
“Thank you, my dear, for this warning.

1576
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:45,800
I have plans that will keep him absent quite constantly for the
future.”

1577
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:48,800
And then they spoke less flightily.

1578
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:53,360
“I always knew,” said the lady, “that you had found a treasure
when that man came.”

1579
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:54,240
The Judge laughed.

1580
02:13:54,240 --> 02:14:04,560
“When it dawned on me,” he said, “how cleverly he caused me to learn the value of his
services by depriving me of them, I doubted whether it was safe to take him back.”

1581
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,040
“Safe!” cried Mrs. Henry.

1582
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:08,200
“Safe, my dear.

1583
02:14:08,200 --> 02:14:11,120
Because I’m afraid he is pretty nearly as shrewd as I am.

1584
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:14,520
And that’s rather dangerous in a subordinate.”

1585
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:16,360
The Judge laughed again.

1586
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:20,960
“But his action regarding the man they call Steve has made me
feel easy.”

1587
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:30,360
And then it came out that the Virginian was supposed to have discovered in some way that Steve
had fallen from the grace of that particular honesty which respects another man’s cattle.

1588
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,400
It was not known for certain.

1589
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:40,200
But calves had begun to disappear in Cattle Land, and cows had
been found killed.

1590
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:46,240
And calves with one brand upon them had been found with mothers
that bore the brand of another owner.

1591
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:53,200
This industry was taking root in Cattle Land, and of those who
practised it, some were beginning to be suspected.

1592
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:56,680
Steve was not quite fully suspected yet.

1593
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:02,560
But that the Virginian had parted company with him was definitely
known.

1594
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:05,840
And neither man would talk about it.

1595
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:25,120
There was the further news that the Bear Creek schoolhouse at length stood complete, floor, walls, and roof; and that a lady from
Bennington, Vermont, a friend of Mrs. Balaam’s, had quite suddenly decided that she would try her hand at instructing the new generation.

1596
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:38,680
The Judge and Mrs. Henry knew this because Mrs. Balaam had told them of her disappointment that she would
be absent from the ranch on Butte Creek when her friend arrived, and therefore unable to entertain her.

1597
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:44,720
The friend’s decision had been quite suddenly made, and must
form the subject of the next chapter.

1598
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,720
CHAPTER VIII

1599
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,560
The Sincere Spinster

1600
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:50,880
I do not know with which of the two estimates⁠—Mr. Taylor’s or
the Virginian’s⁠—you agreed.

1601
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:56,080
Did you think that Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont,
was forty years of age?

1602
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:57,000
That would have been an error.

1603
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:10,360
At the time she wrote the letter to Mrs. Balaam, of which letter certain portions have been quoted in these
pages, she was in her twenty-first year; or, to be more precise, she had been twenty some eight months previous.

1604
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:28,600
Now, it is not usual for young ladies of twenty to contemplate a journey of nearly two thousand miles to a country where Indians and wild
animals live unchained, unless they are to make such journey in company with a protector, or are going to a protector’s arms at the other end.

1605
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:33,160
Nor is school teaching on Bear Creek a usual ambition for such
young ladies.

1606
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:39,040
But Miss Mary Stark Wood was not a usual young lady for two reasons.


1607
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,240
First, there was her descent.

1608
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:50,440
Had she so wished, she could have belonged to any number of those patriotic
societies of which our American ears have grown accustomed to hear so much.

1609
02:16:50,440 --> 02:17:04,480
She could have been enrolled in the Boston Tea Party, the Ethan Allen Ticonderogas, the Green
Mountain Daughters, the Saratoga Sacred Circle, and the Confederated Colonial Chatelaines.

1610
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:24,840
She traced direct descent from the historic lady whose name she bore, that Molly Stark who was not a widow after the battle where
her lord, her Captain John, battled so bravely as to send his name thrilling down through the blood of generations of schoolboys.

1611
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:30,240
This ancestress was her chief claim to be a member of those shining
societies which I have enumerated.

1612
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:36,280
But she had been willing to join none of them, although invitations
to do so were by no means lacking.

1613
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:38,240
I cannot tell you her reason.

1614
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:42,640
Still, I can tell you this.

1615
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:58,080
When these societies were much spoken of in her presence, her very sprightly countenance
became more sprightly, and she added her words of praise or respect to the general chorus.

1616
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:08,360
But when she received an invitation to join one of these bodies, her countenance, as she read the
missive, would assume an expression which was known to her friends as “sticking her nose in the air.”

1617
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:14,000
I do not think that Molly’s reason for refusing to join could
have been a truly good one.

1618
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:28,600
I should add that her most precious possession⁠—a treasure which accompanied her even if she went away for only one night’s absence⁠—was
an heirloom, a little miniature portrait of the old Molly Stark, painted when that far-off dame must have been scarce more than twenty.

1619
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:50,240
And when each summer the young Molly went to Dunbarton, New Hampshire, to pay her established family visit to the last survivors of her connection who bore the name of Stark, no
word that she heard in the Dunbarton houses pleased her so much as when a certain great-aunt would take her by the hand, and, after looking with fond intentness at her, pronounce:⁠—

1620
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:53,240
“My dear, you’re getting more like the General’s wife every year
you live.”

1621
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:55,960
“I suppose you mean my nose,” Molly would then reply.

1622
02:18:55,960 --> 02:19:00,960
“Nonsense, child. You have the family length of nose, and I’ve
never heard that it has disgraced us.”

1623
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:04,480
“But I don’t think I’m tall enough for it.”

1624
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:10,040
“There now, run to your room, and dress for tea. The Starks have
always been punctual.”

1625
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:25,400
And after this annual conversation, Molly would run to her room, and there in its privacy, even at the risk of falling
below the punctuality of the Starks, she would consult two objects for quite a minute before she began to dress.

1626
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:32,000
These objects, as you have already correctly guessed, were the
miniature of the General’s wife and the looking glass.

1627
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,240
So much for Miss Molly Stark Wood’s descent.

1628
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:37,040
The second reason why she was not a usual girl was her character.


1629
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,200
This character was the result of pride and family pluck battling
with family hardship.

1630
02:19:40,200 --> 02:20:02,160
Just one year before she was to be presented to the world⁠—not the great metropolitan world, but a world that would have made her welcome
and done her homage at its little dances and little dinners in Troy and Rutland and Burlington⁠—fortune had turned her back upon the Woods.

1631
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:06,840
Their possessions had never been great ones; but they had sufficed.


1632
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:15,320
From generation to generation the family had gone to school like gentlefolk, dressed like
gentlefolk, used the speech and ways of gentlefolk, and as gentlefolk lived and died.

1633
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,080
And now the mills failed.

1634
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:24,120
Instead of thinking about her first evening dress, Molly found
pupils to whom she could give music lessons.

1635
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:29,000
She found handkerchiefs that she could embroider with initials.


1636
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
And she found fruit that she could make into preserves.

1637
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:49,200
That machine called the typewriter was then in existence, but the day of women typewriters had as yet scarcely
begun to dawn, else I think Molly would have preferred this occupation to the handkerchiefs and the preserves.

1638
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:57,000
There were people in Bennington who “wondered how Miss Wood could
go about from house to house teaching the piano, and she a lady.”

1639
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,200
There always have been such people, I suppose, because the world
must always have a rubbish heap.

1640
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:05,920
But we need not dwell upon them further than to mention one other
remark of theirs regarding Molly.

1641
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:12,560
They all with one voice declared that Sam Bannett was good enough
for anybody who did fancy embroidery at five cents a letter.

1642
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:18,760
“I dare say he had a great-grandmother quite as good as hers,”
remarked Mrs. Flynt, the wife of the Baptist minister.

1643
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:27,800
“That’s entirely possible,” returned the Episcopal rector of
Hoosic, “only we don’t happen to know who she was.”

1644
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:28,600
The rector was a friend of Molly’s.

1645
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:37,000
After this little observation, Mrs. Flynt said no more, but continued her purchases
in the store where she and the rector had happened to find themselves together.

1646
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:44,680
Later she stated to a friend that she had always thought the
Episcopal Church a snobbish one, and now she knew it.

1647
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:49,560
So public opinion went on being indignant over Molly’s conduct.


1648
02:21:49,560 --> 02:22:02,680
She could stoop to work for money, and yet she pretended to hold herself above the most rising
young man in Hoosic Falls, and all just because there was a difference in their grandmothers!

1649
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:04,480
Was this the reason at the bottom of it?

1650
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,040
The very bottom?

1651
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:10,120
I cannot be certain, because I have never been a girl myself.


1652
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:14,640
Perhaps she thought that work is not a stooping, and that marriage
may be.

1653
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:24,720
Perhaps⁠—But all I really know is that Molly Wood continued cheerfully to embroider the
handkerchiefs, make the preserves, teach the pupils⁠—and firmly to reject Sam Bannett.

1654
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:30,800
Thus it went on until she was twenty.

1655
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:37,480
There certain members of her family began to tell her how rich
Sam was going to be⁠—was, indeed, already.

1656
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:42,920
It was at this time that she wrote Mrs. Balaam her doubts and
her desires as to migrating to Bear Creek.

1657
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:50,160
It was at this time also that her face grew a little paler, and her friends
thought that she was overworked, and Mrs. Flynt feared she was losing her looks.

1658
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:58,760
It was at this time, too, that she grew very intimate with that great-aunt
over at Dunbarton, and from her received much comfort and strengthening.

1659
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:03,680
“Never!” said the old lady, “especially if you can’t love him.”


1660
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,480
“I do like him,” said Molly; “and he is very kind.”

1661
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:09,280
“Never!” said the old lady again.

1662
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:13,760
“When I die, you’ll have something⁠—and that will not be long
now.”

1663
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:18,520
Molly flung her arms around her aunt, and stopped her words with
a kiss.

1664
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:22,640
And then one winter afternoon, two years later, came the last
straw.

1665
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,880
The front door of the old house had shut.

1666
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:28,200
Out of it had stepped the persistent suitor.

1667
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:32,360
Mrs. Flynt watched him drive away in his smart sleigh.

1668
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:40,800
“That girl is a fool!” she said furiously; and she came away from
her bedroom window where she had posted herself for observation.

1669
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,320
Inside the old house a door had also shut.

1670
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:44,680
This was the door of Molly’s own room.

1671
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:46,760
And there she sat, in floods of tears.

1672
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:50,400
For she could not bear to hurt a man who loved her with all the
power of love that was in him.

1673
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:55,680
It was about twilight when her door opened, and an elderly lady
came softly in.

1674
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,240
“My dear,” she ventured, “and you were not able⁠—”

1675
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:02,080
“Oh, mother!” cried the girl, “have you come to say that too?”


1676
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:05,280
The next day Miss Wood had become very hard.

1677
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,680
In three weeks she had accepted the position on Bear Creek.

1678
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:12,720
In two months she started, heart-heavy, but with a spirit craving
the unknown.

1679
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:14,160
CHAPTER IX

1680
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:17,040
The Spinster Meets the Unknown

1681
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:25,520
On a Monday noon a small company of horsemen strung out along the trail
from Sunk Creek to gather cattle over their allotted sweep of range.

1682
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:31,960
Spring was backward, and they, as they rode galloping and gathering
upon the cold week’s work, cursed cheerily and occasionally sang.

1683
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:37,600
The Virginian was grave in bearing and of infrequent speech;
but he kept a song going⁠—a matter of some seventy-nine verses.

1684
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:42,120
Seventy-eight were quite unprintable, and rejoiced his brother
cowpunchers monstrously.

1685
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:58,160
They, knowing him to be a singular man, forebore ever to press him, and awaited his own humor, lest he should weary
of the lyric; and when after a day of silence apparently saturnine, he would lift his gentle voice and begin:⁠—

1686
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:06,800
“If you go to monkey with my Looloo girl,I’ll tell you what I’ll do:I’ll
cyarve your heart with my razor, andI’ll shoot you with my pistol, too⁠—”

1687
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:16,400
then they would stridently take up each last line, and keep it going
three, four, ten times, and kick holes in the ground to the swing of it.

1688
02:25:16,400 --> 02:25:25,720
By the levels of Bear Creek that reach like inlets among the promontories of the lonely
hills, they came upon the schoolhouse, roofed and ready for the first native Wyoming crop.

1689
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:30,800
It symbolized the dawn of a neighborhood, and it brought a change
into the wilderness air.

1690
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:45,040
The feel of it struck cold upon the free spirits of the cowpunchers, and they told each other that,
what with women and children and wire fences, this country would not long be a country for men.

1691
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,320
They stopped for a meal at an old comrade’s.

1692
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:50,840
They looked over his gate, and there he was pattering among garden
furrows.

1693
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:59,880
“Pickin’ nosegays?” inquired the Virginian and the old comrade
asked if they could not recognize potatoes except in the dish.

1694
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:03,480
But he grinned sheepishly at them, too, because they knew that
he had not always lived in a garden.

1695
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:08,480
Then he took them into his house, where they saw an object crawling
on the floor with a handful of sulphur matches.

1696
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:20,080
He began to remove the matches, but stopped in alarm at the vociferous result; and
his wife looked in from the kitchen to caution him about humoring little Christopher.

1697
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:29,520
When she beheld the matches she was aghast but when she saw her baby grow quiet in
the arms of the Virginian, she smiled at that cowpuncher and returned to her kitchen.

1698
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,560
Then the Virginian slowly spoke again:⁠—

1699
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:36,400
“How many little strangers have yu’ got, James?”

1700
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:36,680
“Only two.”

1701
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:44,520
“My! Ain’t it most three years since yu’ maried? Yu’ mustn’t
let time creep ahaid o’ yu’, James.”

1702
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:56,760
The father once more grinned at his guests, who themselves turned sheepish and
polite; for Mrs. Westfall came in, brisk and hearty, and set the meat upon the table.

1703
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:59,320
After that, it was she who talked.

1704
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:14,920
The guests ate scrupulously, muttering, “Yes, ma’am,” and “No, ma’am,” in their plates, while their hostess told them of increasing families upon
Bear Creek, and the expected schoolteacher, and little Alfred’s early teething, and how it was time for all of them to become husbands like James.

1705
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:23,280
The bachelors of the saddle listened, always diffident, but eating
heartily to the end; and soon after they rode away in a thoughtful clump.

1706
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:42,920
The wives of Bear Creek were few as yet, and the homes scattered; the schoolhouse was only a sprig on the vast face of a world of elk and bear and uncertain Indians;
but that night, when the earth near the fire was littered with the cowpunchers’ beds, the Virginian was heard drawling to himself: “Alfred and Christopher. Oh, sugar!”

1707
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:45,640
They found pleasure in the delicately chosen shade of this oath.


1708
02:27:45,640 --> 02:28:01,520
He also recited to them a new verse about how he took his Looloo girl to the schoolhouse for to learn her A.B.C.; and as it
was quite original and unprintable, the camp laughed and swore joyfully, and rolled in its blankets to sleep under the stars.

1709
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:11,760
Upon a Monday noon likewise (for things will happen so) some tearful people in
petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a train that was just leaving Bennington, Vermont.

1710
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:17,320
A girl’s face smiled back at them once, and withdrew quickly,
for they must not see the smile die away.

1711
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:27,040
She had with her a little money, a few clothes, and in her mind a rigid determination
neither to be a burden to her mother nor to give in to that mother’s desires.

1712
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:31,000
Absence alone would enable her to carry out this determination.


1713
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:39,280
Beyond these things, she possessed not much except spelling-books, a colonial
miniature, and that craving for the unknown which has been mentioned.

1714
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:53,760
If the ancestors that we carry shut up inside us take turns in dictating to us our actions and
our state of mind, undoubtedly Grandmother Stark was empress of Molly’s spirit upon this Monday.

1715
02:28:53,760 --> 02:29:11,640
At Hoosic Junction, which came soon, she passed the up-train bound back to her home, and seeing the engineer and the conductor⁠—faces that
she knew well⁠—her courage nearly failed her, and she shut her eyes against this glimpse of the familiar things that she was leaving.

1716
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:15,160
To keep herself steady she gripped tightly a little bunch of
flowers in her hand.

1717
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:24,320
But something caused her eyes to open; and there before her stood Sam
Bannett, asking if he might accompany her so far as Rotterdam Junction.

1718
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:29,120
“No!” she told him with a severity born from the struggle she
was making with her grief.

1719
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:33,520
“Not a mile with me. Not to Eagle Bridge. Goodbye.”

1720
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,600
And Sam⁠—what did he do?

1721
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:36,720
He obeyed her, I should like to be sorry for him.

1722
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:40,880
But obedience was not a lover’s part here.

1723
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:52,880
He hesitated, the golden moment hung hovering, the conductor cried “All aboard!” the train went,
and there on the platform stood obedient Sam, with his golden moment gone like a butterfly.

1724
02:29:52,880 --> 02:30:00,080
After Rotterdam Junction, which was some forty minutes farther, Molly
Wood sat bravely up in the through car, dwelling upon the unknown.

1725
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:07,240
She thought that she had attained it in Ohio, on Tuesday morning,
and wrote a letter about it to Bennington.

1726
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:14,880
On Wednesday afternoon she felt sure, and wrote a letter much
more picturesque.

1727
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:30,040
But on the following day, after breakfast at North Platte, Nebraska, she wrote a very long letter indeed, and told them that she
had seen a black pig on a white pile of buffalo bones, catching drops of water in the air as they fell from the railroad tank.

1728
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:33,720
She also wrote that trees were extraordinarily scarce.

1729
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:51,480
Each hour westward from the pig confirmed this opinion, and when she left the train at Rock Creek, late upon that fourth night⁠—in those days
the trains were slower⁠—she knew that she had really attained the unknown, and sent an expensive telegram to say that she was quite well.

1730
02:30:51,480 --> 02:31:06,320
At six in the morning the stage drove away into the sagebrush, with her as its only
passenger; and by sundown she had passed through some of the primitive perils of the world.

1731
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:24,680
The second team, virgin to harness, and displeased with this novelty, tried to take it off, and went down to
the bottom of a gully on its eight hind legs, while Miss Wood sat mute and unflinching beside the driver.

1732
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:39,640
Therefore he, when it was over, and they on the proper road again, invited her earnestly to be his wife
during many of the next fifteen miles, and told her of his snug cabin and his horses and his mine.

1733
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:43,880
Then she got down and rode inside, Independence and Grandmother
Stark shining in her eye.

1734
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:58,800
At Point of Rocks, where they had supper and his drive ended, her face distracted his heart,
and he told her once more about his cabin, and lamentably hoped she would remember him.

1735
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:03,720
She answered sweetly that she would try, and gave him her hand.


1736
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:15,520
After all, he was a frank-looking boy, who had paid her the highest compliment that a boy (or
a man for that matter) knows; and it is said that Molly Stark, in her day, was not a New Woman.

1737
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,960
The new driver banished the first one from the maiden’s mind.


1738
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:23,160
He was not a frank-looking boy, and he had been taking whiskey.


1739
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:34,040
All night long he took it, while his passenger, helpless and sleepless
inside the lurching stage, sat as upright as she possibly could; nor

1740
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:37,160
did the voices that she heard at Drybone reassure her.

1741
02:32:37,160 --> 02:32:50,800
Sunrise found the white stage lurching eternally on across the alkali, with a driver and a bottle on the
box, and a pale girl staring out at the plain, and knotting in her handkerchief some utterly dead flowers.

1742
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:53,200
They came to a river where the man bungled over the ford.

1743
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:58,480
Two wheels sank down over an edge, and the canvas toppled like
a descending kite.

1744
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:11,400
The ripple came sucking through the upper spokes, and as she felt the seat
careen, she put out her head and tremulously asked if anything was wrong.

1745
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:16,160
But the driver was addressing his team with much language, and
also with the lash.

1746
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:27,120
Then a tall rider appeared close against the buried axles, and took
her out of the stage on his horse so suddenly that she screamed.

1747
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:32,200
She felt splashes, saw a swimming flood, and found herself lifted
down upon the shore.

1748
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:49,160
The rider said something to her about cheering up, and its being all
right, but her wits were stock-still, so she did not speak and thank him.

1749
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:57,360
After four days of train and thirty hours of stage, she was having
a little too much of the unknown at once.

1750
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:01,640
Then the tall man gently withdrew leaving her to become herself
again.

1751
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:18,080
She limply regarded the river pouring round the slanted stage, and a number of horsemen with ropes, who righted
the vehicle, and got it quickly to dry land, and disappeared at once with a herd of cattle, uttering lusty yells.

1752
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:23,360
She saw the tall one delaying beside the driver, and speaking.


1753
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:31,600
He spoke so quietly that not a word reached her, until of a sudden
the driver protested loudly.

1754
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,360
The man had thrown something, which turned out to be a bottle.


1755
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:37,000
This twisted loftily and dived into the stream.

1756
02:34:37,000 --> 02:35:05,160
He said something more to the driver, then put his hand on the saddle-horn, looked half-lingeringly at the passenger on the bank, dropped his grave eyes from
hers, and swinging upon his horse, was gone just as the passenger opened her mouth and with inefficient voice murmured, “Oh, thank you!” at his departing back.

1757
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:07,640
The driver drove up now, a chastened creature.

1758
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:27,800
He helped Miss Wood in, and inquired after her welfare with a hanging head; then meek as his own drenched horses, he
climbed back to his reins, and nursed the stage on toward the Bow Leg Mountains much as if it had been a perambulator.

1759
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:32,120
As for Miss Wood, she sat recovering, and she wondered what the
man on the horse must think of her.

1760
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:42,320
She knew that she was not ungrateful, and that if he had given
her an opportunity she would have explained to him.

1761
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:51,160
If he supposed that she did not appreciate his act⁠—Here into the midst of these
meditations came an abrupt memory that she had screamed⁠—she could not be sure when.

1762
02:35:51,160 --> 02:36:01,840
She rehearsed the adventure from the beginning, and found one or two further
uncertainties⁠—how it had all been while she was on the horse, for instance.

1763
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:07,440
It was confusing to determine precisely what she had done with
her arms.

1764
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:09,160
She knew where one of his arms had been.

1765
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,360
And the handkerchief with the flowers was gone.

1766
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:14,280
She made a few rapid dives in search of it.

1767
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:19,680
Had she, or had she not, seen him putting something in his pocket?


1768
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,600
And why had she behaved so unlike herself?

1769
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:32,640
In a few miles Miss Wood entertained sentiments of maidenly
resentment toward her rescuer, and of maidenly hope to see him again.

1770
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:37,720
To that river crossing he came again, alone, when the days were
growing short.

1771
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:40,640
The ford was dry sand, and the stream a winding lane of shingle.


1772
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:52,800
He found a pool⁠—pools always survive the year round in this stream⁠—and having watered
his pony, he lunched near the spot to which he had borne the frightened passenger that day.

1773
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:57,640
Where the flowing current had been he sat, regarding the now
extremely safe channel.

1774
02:36:57,640 --> 02:37:05,240
“She cert’nly wouldn’t need to grip me so close this mawnin’,”
he said, as he pondered over his meal.

1775
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:11,120
“I reckon it will mightily astonish her when I tell her how harmless
the torrent is lookin’.”

1776
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:17,560
He held out to his pony a slice of bread matted with sardines,
which the pony expertly accepted.

1777
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:21,040
“You’re a plumb pie-biter you Monte,” he continued.

1778
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:25,520
Monte rubbed his nose on his master’s shoulder.

1779
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:31,960
“I wouldn’t trust you with berries and cream. No, seh; not though
yu’ did rescue a drownin’ lady.”

1780
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:47,720
Presently he tightened the forward cinch, got in the saddle, and the pony fell into his wise mechanical
jog; for he had come a long way, and was going a long way, and he knew this as well as the man did.

1781
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:53,480
To use the language of Cattle Land, steers had “jumped to seventy-five.”


1782
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:57,200
This was a great and prosperous leap in their value.

1783
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:07,080
To have flourished in that golden time you need not be dead now, nor even middle-aged;
but it is Wyoming mythology already⁠—quite as fabulous as the high-jumping cow.

1784
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:12,760
Indeed, people gathered together and behaved themselves much
in the same pleasant and improbable way.

1785
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:35,600
Johnson County, and Natrona, and Converse, and others, to say nothing of the Cheyenne Club, had been jumping over the moon for some weeks, all on account of
steers; and on the strength of this vigorous price of seventy-five, the Stanton Brothers were giving a barbecue at the Goose Egg outfit, their ranch on Bear Creek.

1786
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:47,080
Of course the whole neighborhood was bidden, and would come forty miles to a
man; some would come further⁠—the Virginian was coming a hundred and eighteen.

1787
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:55,240
It had struck him⁠—rather suddenly, as shall be made plain⁠—that he
should like to see how they were getting along up there on Bear Creek.

1788
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:58,840
“They,” was how he put it to his acquaintances.

1789
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:09,280
His acquaintances did not know that he had bought himself a pair of
trousers and a scarf, unnecessarily excellent for such a general visit.

1790
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:16,600
They did not know that in the spring, two days after the adventure with
the stage, he had learned accidentally who the lady in the stage was.

1791
02:39:16,600 --> 02:39:27,640
This he had kept to himself; nor did the camp ever notice that he had ceased to sing
that eightieth stanza he had made about the A.B.C.⁠—the stanza which was not printable.

1792
02:39:27,640 --> 02:39:32,920
He effaced it imperceptibly, giving the boys the other seventy-nine
at judicious intervals.

1793
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:42,240
They dreamed of no guile, but merely saw in him, whether frequenting camp or town,
the same not over-angelic comrade whom they valued and could not wholly understand.

1794
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:49,000
All spring he had ridden trail, worked at ditches during summer,
and now he had just finished with the beef roundup.

1795
02:39:49,000 --> 02:40:07,600
Yesterday, while he was spending a little comfortable money at the Drybone hog-ranch, a casual traveller from the north gossiped of Bear Creek, and the
fences up there, and the farm crops, the Westfalls, and the young schoolmarm from Vermont, for whom the Taylors had built a cabin next door to theirs.

1796
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:14,520
The traveller had not seen her, but Mrs. Taylor and all the ladies thought
the world of her, and Lin McLean had told him she was “away up in G.”

1797
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:19,320
She would have plenty of partners at this Swinton barbecue.

1798
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:23,400
Great boon for the country, wasn’t it, steers jumping that way?


1799
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:32,360
The Virginian heard, asking no questions; and left town in an hour,
with the scarf and trousers tied in his slicker behind his saddle.

1800
02:40:32,360 --> 02:40:41,280
After looking upon the ford again, even though it was dry and
not at all the same place, he journeyed in attentively.

1801
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:51,320
When you have been hard at work for months with no time to think,
of course you think a great deal during your first empty days.

1802
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:56,360
“Step along, you Monte hawss!” he said, rousing after some while.


1803
02:40:56,360 --> 02:41:03,000
He disciplined Monte, who flattened his ears affectedly and snorted.


1804
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:10,720
“Why, you surely ain’ thinkin’ of you’-self as a hero? She wasn’t
really a-drowndin’, you pie-biter.”

1805
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:13,720
He rested his serious glance upon the alkali.

1806
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:17,240
“She’s not likely to have forgot that mix-up, though.

1807
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:20,400
I guess I’ll not remind her about grippin’ me, and all that.

1808
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:23,560
She wasn’t the kind a man ought to josh about such things.

1809
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:26,520
She had a right clear eye.”

1810
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:32,960
Thus, tall and loose in the saddle, did he jog along the sixty
miles which still lay between him and the dance.

1811
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:34,120
CHAPTER X

1812
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:35,920
Where Fancy Was Bred

1813
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:44,320
Two camps in the open, and the Virginian’s Monte horse, untired,
brought him to the Swintons’ in good time for the barbecue.

1814
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:49,720
The horse received good food at length, while his rider was welcomed
with good whiskey.

1815
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:55,160
Good whiskey⁠—for had not steers jumped to seventy-five?

1816
02:41:55,160 --> 02:42:01,920
Inside the Goose Egg kitchen many small delicacies were preparing,
and a steer was roasting whole outside.

1817
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:11,440
The bed of flame under it showed steadily brighter against the
dusk that was beginning to veil the lowlands.

1818
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:16,760
The busy hosts went and came, while men stood and men lay near
the fire-glow.

1819
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:31,000
Chalkeye was there, and Nebrasky, and Trampas, and Honey Wiggin, with others, enjoying the occasion;
but Honey Wiggin was enjoying himself: he had an audience; he was sitting up discoursing to it.

1820
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:35,000
“Hello!” he said, perceiving the Virginian.

1821
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:41,800
“So you’ve dropped in for your turn! Number⁠—six, ain’t he, boys?”


1822
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:50,120
“Depends who’s a-runnin’ the countin’,” said the Virginian, and
stretched himself down among the audience.

1823
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:54,680
“I’ve saw him number one when nobody else was around,” said Trampas.


1824
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:59,200
“How far away was you standin’ when you beheld that?” inquired
the lounging Southerner.

1825
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:08,440
“Well, boys,” said Wiggin, “I expect it will be Miss Schoolmarm
says who’s number one tonight.”

1826
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:15,360
“So she’s arrived in this hyeh country?” observed the Virginian,
very casually.

1827
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:17,840
“Arrived!” said Trampas again.

1828
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:19,600
“Where have you been grazing lately?”

1829
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:21,640
“A right smart way from the mules.”

1830
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:27,080
“Nebrasky and the boys was tellin’ me they’d missed yu’ off the
range,” again interposed Wiggin.

1831
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:36,280
“Say, Nebrasky, who have yu’ offered your canary to the schoolmarm
said you mustn’t give her?”

1832
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:38,160
Nebrasky grinned wretchedly.

1833
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:46,080
“Well, she’s a lady, and she’s square, not takin’ a man’s gift
when she don’t take the man.

1834
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:50,360
But you’d ought to get back all them letters yu’ wrote her.

1835
02:43:50,360 --> 02:43:54,520
Yu’ sure ought to ask her for them telltales.”

1836
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:57,840
“Ah, pshaw, Honey!” protested the youth.

1837
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:00,760
It was well known that he could not write his name.

1838
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:07,680
“Why, if here ain’t Bokay Baldy!” cried the agile Wiggin, stooping
to fresh prey.

1839
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:10,560
“Found them slippers yet, Baldy?

1840
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:14,320
Tell yu’ boys, that was turruble sad luck Baldy had.

1841
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:15,440
Did yu’ hear about that?

1842
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:21,360
Baldy, yu’ know, he can stay on a tame horse most as well as
the schoolmarm.

1843
02:44:21,360 --> 02:44:26,840
But just you give him a pair of young knittin’-needles and see
him make ’em sweat!

1844
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:32,200
He worked an elegant pair of slippers with pink cabbages on ’em
for Miss Wood.”

1845
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:35,280
“I bought ’em at Medicine Bow,” blundered Baldy.

1846
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:39,600
“So yu’ did!” assented the skilful comedian.

1847
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:42,200
“Baldy he bought ’em.

1848
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:53,120
And on the road to her cabin there at the Taylors’ he got
thinkin’ they might be too big, and he got studyin’ what to do.

1849
02:44:53,120 --> 02:45:12,400
And he fixed up to tell her about his not bein’ sure of the size, and how she was to let him know if they
dropped off her, and he’d exchange ’em, and when he got right near her door, why, he couldn’t find his courage.

1850
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:19,640
And so he slips the parcel under the fence and starts serenadin’
her.

1851
02:45:19,640 --> 02:45:21,760
But she ain’t inside her cabin at all.

1852
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:29,160
She’s at supper next door with the Taylors, and Baldy singin’
‘Love has conqwered pride and angwer’ to a lone house.

1853
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:34,000
Lin McLean was comin’ up by Taylor’s corral, where Taylor’s Texas
bull was.

1854
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,160
Well, it was turruble sad.

1855
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:44,560
Baldy’s pants got tore, but he fell inside the fence, and Lin
druv the bull back and somebody stole them Medicine Bow galoshes.

1856
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:46,520
Are you goin’ to knit her some more, Bokay?”

1857
02:45:46,520 --> 02:45:50,360
“About half that ain’t straight,” Baldy commented, with mildness.


1858
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:57,360
“The half that was tore off yer pants? Well, never mind, Baldy;
Lin will get left too, same as all of yu’.”

1859
02:45:57,360 --> 02:46:00,240
“Is there many?” inquired the Virginian.

1860
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:04,320
He was still stretched on his back, looking up at the sky.

1861
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:08,680
“I don’t know how many she’s been used to where she was raised,”
Wiggin answered.

1862
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:17,240
“A kid stage-driver come from Point of Rocks one day and went
back the next.

1863
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:35,920
Then the foreman of the 76 outfit, and the horse-wrangler from the Bar-Circle-L,
and two deputy marshals, with punchers, stringin’ right along⁠—all got their tumble.

1864
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:43,560
Old Judge Burrage from Cheyenne come up in August for a hunt
and stayed round here and never hunted at all.

1865
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:48,120
There was that horse thief⁠—awful good-lookin’.

1866
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:54,720
Taylor wanted to warn her about him, but Mrs. Taylor said she’d
look after her if it was needed.

1867
02:46:54,720 --> 02:47:03,480
Mr. Horse-thief gave it up quicker than most; but the schoolmarm couldn’t have
knowed he had a Mrs. Horse-thief camped on Poison Spider till afterwards.

1868
02:47:03,480 --> 02:47:07,960
She wouldn’t go ridin’ with him.

1869
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:10,520
She’ll go with some, takin’ a kid along.”

1870
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:11,240
“Bah!” said Trampas.

1871
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:20,080
The Virginian stopped looking at the sky, and watched Trampas
from where he lay.

1872
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:24,200
“I think she encourages a man some,” said poor Nebrasky.

1873
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:29,880
“Encourages? Because she lets yu’ teach her how to shoot,” said
Wiggin.

1874
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:33,480
“Well⁠—I don’t guess I’m a judge.

1875
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:35,800
I’ve always kind o’ kep’ away from them good women.

1876
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:39,080
Don’t seem to think of anything to chat about to ’em.

1877
02:47:39,080 --> 02:47:44,280
The only folks I’d say she encourages is the school kids.

1878
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,440
She kisses them.”

1879
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:49,120
“Riding and shooting and kissing the kids,” sneered Trampas.

1880
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:52,480
“That’s a heap too pussy-kitten for me.”

1881
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:53,000
They laughed.

1882
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,320
The sagebrush audience is readily cynical.

1883
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:58,080
“Look for the man, I say,” Trampas pursued.

1884
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:03,640
“And ain’t he there? She leaves Baldy sit on the fence while
she and Lin McLean⁠—”

1885
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:14,160
They laughed loudly at the blackguard picture which he drew; and
the laugh stopped short, for the Virginian stood over Trampas.

1886
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:17,040
“You can rise up now, and tell them you lie,” he said.

1887
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:20,800
The man was still for a moment in the dead silence.

1888
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:26,720
“I thought you claimed you and her wasn’t acquainted,” said he
then.

1889
02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:32,160
“Stand on your laigs, you polecat, and say you’re a liar!”

1890
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:34,800
Trampas’s hand moved behind him.

1891
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:37,680
“Quit that,” said the Southerner, “or I’ll break your neck!”

1892
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,880
The eye of a man is the prince of deadly weapons.

1893
02:48:39,880 --> 02:48:43,800
Trampas looked in the Virginian’s, and slowly rose.

1894
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:48,960
“I didn’t mean⁠—” he began, and paused, his face poisonously
bloated.

1895
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:51,640
“Well, I’ll call that sufficient.

1896
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:52,920
Keep a-standin’ still.

1897
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,880
I ain’ going to trouble yu’ long.

1898
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:59,240
In admittin’ yourself to be a liar you have spoke God’s truth
for onced.

1899
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:08,680
Honey Wiggin, you and me and the boys have hit town too frequent
for any of us to play Sunday on the balance of the gang.”

1900
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:13,000
He stopped and surveyed Public Opinion, seated around in carefully
inexpressive attention.

1901
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:20,640
“We ain’t a Christian outfit a little bit, and maybe we have
most forgotten what decency feels like.

1902
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:23,480
But I reckon we haven’t forgot what it means.

1903
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:27,320
You can sit down now, if you want.”

1904
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:31,800
The liar stood and sneered experimentally, looking at Public
Opinion.

1905
02:49:31,800 --> 02:49:42,600
But this changeful deity was no longer with him, and he heard it variously
assenting, “That’s so,” and “She’s a lady,” and otherwise excellently moralizing.

1906
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:44,000
So he held his peace.

1907
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:59,480
When, however, the Virginian had departed to the roasting steer, and Public Opinion relaxed into that comfort which we
all experience when the sermon ends, Trampas sat down amid the reviving cheerfulness, and ventured again to be facetious.

1908
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:02,240
“Shut your rank mouth,” said Wiggin to him, amiably.

1909
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:07,720
“I don’t care whether he knows her or if he done it on principle.


1910
02:50:07,720 --> 02:50:10,680
I’ll accept the roundin’ up he gave us⁠—and say!

1911
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:13,040
You’ll swallo’ your dose, too!

1912
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:14,600
Us boys’ll stand in with him in this.”

1913
02:50:14,600 --> 02:50:15,120
So Trampas swallowed.

1914
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:16,800
And what of the Virginian?

1915
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:27,200
He had championed the feeble, and spoken honorably in meeting, and according to all the
constitutions and bylaws of morality, he should have been walking in virtue’s especial calm.

1916
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:27,840
But there it was!

1917
02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:39,320
he had spoken; he had given them a peep through the keyhole at his inner man; and as he prowled away from
the assemblage before whom he stood convicted of decency, it was vicious rather than virtuous that he felt.

1918
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:43,880
Other matters also disquieted him⁠—so Lin McLean was hanging
round that schoolmarm!

1919
02:50:43,880 --> 02:50:48,840
Yet he joined Ben Swinton in a seemingly Christian spirit.

1920
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:54,360
He took some whiskey and praised the size of the barrel, speaking
with his host like this:⁠—

1921
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:59,600
“There cert’nly ain’ goin’ to be trouble about a second helpin’.”


1922
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:05,680
“Hope not. We’d ought to have more trimmings, though. We’re shy
on ducks.”

1923
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:10,720
“Yu’ have the barrel. Has Lin McLean seen that?”

1924
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:16,920
“No. We tried for ducks away down as far as the Laparel outfit.
A real barbecue⁠—”

1925
02:51:16,920 --> 02:51:24,840
“There’s large thirsts on Bear Creek. Lin McLean will pass on
ducks.”

1926
02:51:24,840 --> 02:51:26,800
“Lin’s not thirsty this month.”

1927
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:28,760
“Signed for one month, has he?”

1928
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:32,720
“Signed! He’s spooning our schoolmarm!”

1929
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:34,600
“They claim she’s a right sweet-faced girl.”

1930
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:39,600
“Yes; yes; awful agreeable. And next thing you’re fooled clean
through.”

1931
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:42,680
“Yu’ don’t say!”

1932
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:48,120
“She keeps a-teaching the darned kids, and it seems like a good
growed-up man can’t interest her.”

1933
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:50,200
“Yu’ don’t say!”

1934
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:58,920
“There used to be all the ducks you wanted at the Laparel, but
their fool cook’s dead stuck on raising turkeys this year.”

1935
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:06,520
“That must have been mighty close to a drowndin’ the schoolmarm
got at South Fork.”

1936
02:52:06,520 --> 02:52:11,880
“Why, I guess not. When? She’s never spoken of any such thing⁠—that
I’ve heard.”

1937
02:52:11,880 --> 02:52:16,840
“Mos’ likely the stage-driver got it wrong, then.”

1938
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:17,320
“Yes.

1939
02:52:17,320 --> 02:52:18,840
Must have drownded somebody else.

1940
02:52:18,840 --> 02:52:20,200
Here they come!

1941
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:22,080
That’s her ridin’ the horse.

1942
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:25,000
There’s the Westfalls.

1943
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,440
Where are you running to?”

1944
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:32,120
“To fix up. Got any soap around hyeh?”

1945
02:52:32,120 --> 02:52:42,360
“Yes,” shouted Swinton, for the Virginian was now some distance
away; “towels and everything in the dugout.”

1946
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:45,600
And he went to welcome his first formal guests.

1947
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:47,880
The Virginian reached his saddle under a shed.

1948
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:53,680
“So she’s never mentioned it,” said he, untying his slicker for
the trousers and scarf.

1949
02:52:53,680 --> 02:52:57,040
“I didn’t notice Lin anywheres around her.”

1950
02:52:57,040 --> 02:53:09,000
He was over in the dugout now, whipping off his overalls; and soon he was excellently
clean and ready, except for the tie in his scarf and the part in his hair.

1951
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:12,280
“I’d have knowed her in Greenland,” he remarked.

1952
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:18,040
He held the candle up and down at the looking-glass, and the
looking-glass up and down at his head.

1953
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:21,280
“It’s mighty strange why she ain’t mentioned that.”

1954
02:53:21,280 --> 02:53:32,520
He worried the scarf a fold or two further, and at length, a trifle more than satisfied
with his appearance, he proceeded most serenely toward the sound of the tuning fiddles.

1955
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:42,720
He passed through the storeroom behind the kitchen, stepping lightly lest he
should rouse the ten or twelve babies that lay on the table or beneath it.

1956
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:50,640
On Bear Creek babies and children always went with their parents
to a dance, because nurses were unknown.

1957
02:53:50,640 --> 02:54:04,520
So little Alfred and Christopher lay there among the wraps, parallel and crosswise with little Taylors, and little Carmodys, and
Lees, and all the Bear Creek offspring that was not yet able to skip at large and hamper its indulgent elders in the ballroom.

1958
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:10,960
“Why, Lin ain’t hyeh yet!” said the Virginian, looking in upon
the people.

1959
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:13,320
There was Miss Wood, standing up for the quadrille.

1960
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:17,360
“I didn’t remember her hair was that pretty,” said he.

1961
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:19,480
“But ain’t she a little, little girl!”

1962
02:54:19,480 --> 02:54:25,640
Now she was in truth five feet three; but then he could look
away down on the top of her head.

1963
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:27,480
“Salute your honey!” called the first fiddler.

1964
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:33,800
All partners bowed to each other, and as she turned, Miss Wood
saw the man in the doorway.

1965
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:52,800
Again, as it had been at South Fork that day, his eyes dropped from hers, and she divining instantly why he had come after half a year, thought of
the handkerchief and of that scream of hers in the river, and became filled with tyranny and anticipation; for indeed he was fine to look upon.

1966
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:56,160
So she danced away, carefully unaware of his existence.

1967
02:54:56,160 --> 02:55:02,360
“First lady, centre!” said her partner, reminding her of her
turn.

1968
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:06,760
“Have you forgotten how it goes since last time?”

1969
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:09,840
Molly Wood did not forget again, but quadrilled with the most
sprightly devotion.

1970
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:12,360
“I see some new faces tonight,” said she, presently.

1971
02:55:12,360 --> 02:55:15,960
“Yu’ always do forget our poor faces,” said her partner.

1972
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:20,560
“Oh, no! There’s a stranger now. Who is that black man?”

1973
02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:24,600
“Well⁠—he’s from Virginia, and he ain’t allowin’ he’s black.”


1974
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:26,720
“He’s a tenderfoot, I suppose?”

1975
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:33,480
“Ha, ha, ha! That’s rich, too!” and so the simple partner explained
a great deal about the Virginian to Molly Wood.

1976
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:38,120
At the end of the set she saw the man by the door take a step
in her direction.

1977
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:41,800
“Oh,” said she, quickly, to the partner, “how warm it is!

1978
02:55:41,800 --> 02:55:44,920
I must see how those babies are doing.”

1979
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:48,800
And she passed the Virginian in a breeze of unconcern.

1980
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:51,080
His eyes gravely lingered where she had gone.

1981
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:54,640
“She knowed me right away,” said he.

1982
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:56,640
He looked for a moment, then leaned against the door.

1983
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,800
“ ’How warm it is!’ said she.

1984
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:13,680
Well, it ain’t so screechin’ hot hyeh; and as for rushin’ after Alfred and Christopher, when their natural motheh
is bumpin’ around handy⁠—she cert’nly can’t be offended?” he broke off, and looked again where she had gone.

1985
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:18,200
And then Miss Wood passed him brightly again, and was dancing
the schottische almost immediately.

1986
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:21,000
“Oh, yes, she knows me,” the swarthy cowpuncher mused.

1987
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:28,520
“She has to take trouble not to see me. And what she’s a-fussin’
at is mighty interestin’. Hello!”

1988
02:56:28,520 --> 02:56:31,280
“Hello!” returned Lin McLean, sourly.

1989
02:56:31,280 --> 02:56:32,720
He had just looked into the kitchen.

1990
02:56:32,720 --> 02:56:36,000
“Not dancin’?” the Southerner inquired.

1991
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,200
“Don’t know how.”

1992
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:41,920
“Had scyarlet fever and forgot your past life?”

1993
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:42,440
Lin grinned.

1994
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:47,520
“Better persuade the schoolmarm to learn it. She’s goin’ to give
me instruction .”

1995
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:50,040
“Huh!” went Mr. McLean, and skulked out to the barrel.

1996
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:54,120
“Why, they claimed you weren’t drinkin’ this month!” said his
friend, following.

1997
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:55,080
“Well, I am. Here’s luck!”

1998
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:56,880
The two pledged in tin cups.

1999
02:56:56,880 --> 02:57:02,680
“But I’m not waltzin’ with her,” blurted Mr. McLean grievously.


2000
02:57:02,680 --> 02:57:04,080
“She called me an exception.”

2001
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:10,000
“Waltzin’,” repeated the Virginian quickly, and hearing the fiddles
he hastened away.

2002
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:22,600
Few in the Bear Creek Country could waltz, and with these few it was mostly an unsteered
and ponderous exhibition; therefore was the Southerner bent upon profiting by his skill.

2003
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:30,920
He entered the room, and his lady saw him come where she sat
alone for the moment, and her thoughts grew a little hurried.

2004
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:33,960
“Will you try a turn, ma’am?”

2005
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:35,120
“I beg your pardon?”

2006
02:57:35,120 --> 02:57:38,080
It was a remote, well-schooled eye that she lifted now upon him.


2007
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:41,720
“If you like a waltz, ma’am, will you waltz with me?”

2008
02:57:41,720 --> 02:57:48,880
“You’re from Virginia, I understand?” said Molly Wood, regarding
him politely, but not rising.

2009
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:54,080
One gains authority immensely by keeping one’s seat.

2010
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,240
All good teachers know this.

2011
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:59,360
“Yes, ma’am, from Virginia.”

2012
02:57:59,360 --> 02:58:02,320
“I’ve heard that Southerners have such good manners.”

2013
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:03,720
“That’s correct.”

2014
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:08,080
The cowpuncher flushed, but he spoke in his unvaryingly gentle
voice.

2015
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:22,760
“For in New England, you know,” pursued Miss Molly, noting his scarf and clean-shaven chin, and then
again steadily meeting his eye, “gentlemen ask to be presented to ladies before they ask them to waltz.”

2016
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:30,920
He stood a moment before her, deeper and deeper scarlet; and the
more she saw his handsome face, the keener rose her excitement.

2017
02:58:30,920 --> 02:58:40,680
She waited for him to speak of the river; for then she was going to be
surprised, and gradually to remember, and finally to be very nice to him.

2018
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:42,440
But he did not wait.

2019
02:58:42,440 --> 02:58:53,360
“I ask your pardon, lady,” said he, and bowing, walked off, leaving
her at once afraid that he might not come back.

2020
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:56,360
But she had altogether mistaken her man.

2021
02:58:56,360 --> 02:59:00,360
Back he came serenely with Mr. Taylor, and was duly presented
to her.

2022
02:59:00,360 --> 02:59:04,480
Thus were the conventions vindicated.

2023
02:59:04,480 --> 02:59:16,560
It can never be known what the cowpuncher was going to say next; for Uncle Hughey stepped up with a
glass of water which he had left Wood to bring, and asking for a turn, most graciously received it.

2024
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:26,080
She danced away from a situation where she began to feel herself
getting the worst of it.

2025
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:32,000
One moment the Virginian stared at his lady as she lightly circulated,
and then he went out to the barrel.

2026
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,080
Leave him for Uncle Hershey!

2027
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:36,960
Jealousy is a deep and delicate thing, and works its spite in
many ways.

2028
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:49,960
The Virginian had been ready to look at Lin McLean with a hostile eye; but finding him now beside the barrel,
he felt a brotherhood between himself and Lin, and his hostility had taken a new and whimsical direction.

2029
02:59:49,960 --> 02:59:52,400
“Here’s how!” said he to McLean.

2030
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:54,440
And they pledged each other in the tin cups.

2031
02:59:54,440 --> 02:59:58,720
“Been gettin’ them instructions?” said Mr. McLean, grinning.

2032
02:59:58,720 --> 03:00:02,080
“I thought I saw yu’ learning your steps through the window.”


2033
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:04,640
“Here’s your good health,” said the Southerner.

2034
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,840
Once more they pledged each other handsomely.

2035
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:13,240
“Did she call you an exception, or anything?” said Lin.

2036
03:00:13,240 --> 03:00:16,480
“Well, it would cipher out right close in that neighborhood.”


2037
03:00:16,480 --> 03:00:23,320
“Here’s how, then!” cried the delighted Lin, over his cup.

2038
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:31,920
“Jest because yu’ happen to come from Vermont,” continued Mr.
McLean, “is no cause for extra pride.

2039
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:33,760
Shoo!

2040
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:45,280
I was raised in Massachusetts myself, and big men have been raised there,
too⁠—Daniel Webster and Israel Putnam: and a lot of them politicians.”

2041
03:00:45,280 --> 03:00:50,280
“Virginia is a good little old state,” observed the Southerner.


2042
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:57,680
“Both of ’em’s a sight ahead of Vermont. She told me I was the
first exception she’d struck.”

2043
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:01,360
“What rule were you provin’ at the time, Lin?”

2044
03:01:01,360 --> 03:01:04,600
“Well yu’ see, I started to kiss her.”

2045
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:06,520
“Yu’ didn’t!”

2046
03:01:06,520 --> 03:01:07,920
“Shucks! I didn’t mean nothin’.”

2047
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:10,480
“I reckon yu’ stopped mighty sudden?”

2048
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:30,040
“Why, I’d been ridin’ out with her⁠—ridin’ to school, ridin’ from school, and a-comin’ and a-goin’, and she
chattin’ cheerful and askin’ me a heap o’ questions all about myself every day, and I not lyin’ much neither.

2049
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:33,320
And so I figured she wouldn’t mind.

2050
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:34,680
Lots of ’em like it.

2051
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:37,120
But she didn’t, you bet!”

2052
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:41,680
“No,” said the Virginian, deeply proud of his lady who had slighted
him.

2053
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:57,640
He had pulled her out of the water once, and he had been her unrewarded knight even today, and he felt his grievance; but he
spoke not of it to Lin; for he felt also, in memory, her arms clinging round him as he carried her ashore upon his horse.

2054
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:05,680
But he muttered, “Plumb ridiculous!” as her injustice struck
him afresh, while the outraged McLean told his tale.

2055
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:09,560
“Trample is what she has done on me tonight, and without notice.


2056
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:20,200
We was startin’ to come here; Taylor and Mrs. were ahead in the buggy, and I was
holdin’ her horse, and helpin’ her up in the saddle, like I done for days and days.

2057
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:20,880
Who was there to see us?

2058
03:02:20,880 --> 03:02:25,280
And I figured she’d not mind, and she calls me an exception!

2059
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:30,520
Yu’d ought to’ve just heard her about Western men respectin’
women.

2060
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:33,200
So that’s the last word we’ve spoke.

2061
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:41,000
We come twenty-five miles then, she scootin’ in front, and her
horse kickin’ the sand in my face.

2062
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:44,880
Mrs. Taylor, she guessed something was up, but she didn’t tell.”


2063
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:46,360
“Miss Wood did not tell?”

2064
03:02:46,360 --> 03:02:53,680
“Not she! She’ll never open her head. She can take care of herself,
you bet!”

2065
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:58,840
The fiddles sounded hilariously in the house, and the feet also.


2066
03:02:58,840 --> 03:03:07,320
They had warmed up altogether, and their dancing figures crossed
the windows back and forth.

2067
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:12,960
The two cowpunchers drew near to a window and looked in gloomily.


2068
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:14,920
“There she goes,” said Lin.

2069
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:18,200
“With Uncle Hughey again,” said the Virginian, sourly.

2070
03:03:18,200 --> 03:03:24,160
“Yu’ might suppose he didn’t have a wife and twins, to see the
way he goes gambollin’ around.”

2071
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:27,600
“Westfall is takin’ a turn with her now,” said McLean.

2072
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:28,920
“James!” exclaimed the Virginian.

2073
03:03:28,920 --> 03:03:34,480
“He’s another with a wife and fam’ly, and he gets the dancin’,
too.”

2074
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:39,160
“There she goes with Taylor,” said Lin, presently.

2075
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:42,200
“Another married man!” the Southerner commented.

2076
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:49,880
They prowled round to the storeroom, and passed through the kitchen
to where the dancers were robustly tramping.

2077
03:03:49,880 --> 03:03:52,240
Miss Wood was still the partner of Mr. Taylor.

2078
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:56,400
“Let’s have some whiskey,” said the Virginian.

2079
03:03:56,400 --> 03:04:01,680
They had it, and returned, and the Virginian’s disgust and sense
of injury grew deeper.

2080
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:03,520
“Old Carmody has got her now,” he drawled.

2081
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:05,520
“He polkas like a landslide.

2082
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:09,640
She learns his monkey-faced kid to spell dog and cow all the
mawnin’.

2083
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:16,240
He’d ought to be tucked up cozy in his bed right now, old Carmody
ought.”

2084
03:04:16,240 --> 03:04:25,360
They were standing in that place set apart for the sleeping children; and just at
this moment one of two babies that were stowed beneath a chair uttered a drowsy note.

2085
03:04:25,360 --> 03:04:34,080
A much louder cry, indeed a chorus of lament, would have been needed to reach the
ears of the parents in the room beyond, such was the noisy volume of the dance.

2086
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:44,640
But in this quiet place the light sound caught Mr. McLean’s attention,
and he turned to see if anything were wrong.

2087
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:47,360
But both babies were sleeping peacefully.

2088
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:50,800
“Them’s Uncle Hughey’s twins,” he said.

2089
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:55,000
“How do you happen to know that?” inquired the Virginian, suddenly
interested.

2090
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:01,240
“Saw his wife put ’em under the chair so she could find ’em right
off when she come to go home.”

2091
03:05:01,240 --> 03:05:02,600
“Oh,” said the Virginian, thoughtfully.

2092
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:06,800
“Oh, find ’em right off. Yes. Uncle Hughey’s twins.”

2093
03:05:06,800 --> 03:05:11,280
He walked to a spot from which he could view the dance.

2094
03:05:11,280 --> 03:05:17,680
“Well,” he continued, returning, “the schoolmarm must have taken
quite a notion to Uncle Hughey.

2095
03:05:17,680 --> 03:05:19,680
He has got her for this quadrille.”

2096
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:25,680
The Virginian was now speaking without rancor; but his words came with
a slightly augmented drawl, and this with him was often a bad omen.

2097
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:31,160
He now turned his eyes upon the collected babies wrapped in various
colored shawls and knitted work.

2098
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:35,760
“Nine, ten, eleven, beautiful sleepin’ strangers,” he counted,
in a sweet voice.

2099
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:36,920
“Any of ’em your’n, Lin?”

2100
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:38,720
“Not that I know of,” grinned Mr. McLean.

2101
03:05:38,720 --> 03:05:40,160
“Eleven, twelve.

2102
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:44,160
This hyeh is little Christopher in the blue-stripe quilt⁠—or
maybe that other yello’-head is him.

2103
03:05:44,160 --> 03:05:47,960
The angels have commenced to drop in on us right smart along
Bear Creek, Lin.”

2104
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:49,480
“What trash are yu’ talkin’ anyway?”

2105
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:59,480
“If they look so awful alike in the heavenly gyarden,” the gentle Southerner continued,
“I’d just hate to be the folks that has the cuttin’ of ’em out o’ the general herd.

2106
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:05,120
And that’s a right quaint notion too,” he added softly.

2107
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:08,080
“Them under the chair are Uncle Hughey’s, didn’t you tell me?”


2108
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:13,800
And stooping, he lifted the torpid babies and placed them beneath
a table.

2109
03:06:13,800 --> 03:06:17,440
“No, that ain’t thorough,” he murmured.

2110
03:06:17,440 --> 03:06:30,120
With wonderful dexterity and solicitude for their welfare, he removed the loose
wrap which was around them, and this soon led to an intricate process of exchange.

2111
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:34,680
For a moment Mr. McLean had been staring at the Virginian, puzzled.


2112
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:38,840
Then, with a joyful yelp of enlightenment, he sprang to abet
him.

2113
03:06:38,840 --> 03:06:51,440
And while both busied themselves with the shawls and quilts, the unconscious parents went
dancing vigorously on, and the small, occasional cries of their progeny did not reach them.

2114
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:53,640
CHAPTER XI

2115
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:57,000
“You’re Going to Love Me Before We Get Through”

2116
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,320
The Swinton barbecue was over.

2117
03:06:59,320 --> 03:07:16,600
The fiddles were silent, the steer was eaten, the barrel emptied, or largely so, and the tapers extinguished; round the house and sunken
fire all movement of guests was quiet; the families were long departed homeward, and after their hospitable turbulence, the Swintons slept.

2118
03:07:16,600 --> 03:07:27,280
Mr. and Mrs. Westfall drove through the night, and as they neared their
cabin there came from among the bundled wraps a still, small voice.

2119
03:07:27,280 --> 03:07:33,280
“Jim,” said his wife, “I said Alfred would catch cold.”

2120
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:37,800
“Bosh! Lizzie, don’t you fret. He’s a little more than a yearlin’,
and of course he’ll snuffle.”

2121
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:40,160
And young James took a kiss from his love.

2122
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:49,960
“Well, how you can speak of Alfred that way, calling him a yearling, as if he
was a calf, and he just as much your child as mine, I don’t see, James Westfall!”

2123
03:07:49,960 --> 03:07:54,000
“Why, what under the sun do you mean?”

2124
03:07:54,000 --> 03:08:00,960
“There he goes again! Do hurry up home, Jim. He’s got a real
strange cough.”

2125
03:08:00,960 --> 03:08:02,240
So they hurried home.

2126
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:10,960
Soon the nine miles were finished, and good James was unhitching by his stable
lantern, while his wife in the house hastened to commit their offspring to bed.

2127
03:08:10,960 --> 03:08:19,160
The traces had dropped, and each horse marched forward for further
unbuckling, when James heard himself called.

2128
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:26,000
Indeed, there was that in his wife’s voice which made him jerk
out his pistol as he ran.

2129
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:32,440
But it was no bear or Indian⁠—only two strange children on the
bed.

2130
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:35,000
His wife was glaring at them.

2131
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:38,840
He sighed with relief and laid down the pistol.

2132
03:08:38,840 --> 03:08:44,040
“Put that on again, James Westfall. You’ll need it. Look here!”


2133
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:49,520
“Well, they won’t bite. Whose are they? Where have you stowed
ourn?”

2134
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:53,160
“Where have I⁠—” Utterance forsook this mother for a moment.

2135
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:55,880
“And you ask me!” she continued.

2136
03:08:55,880 --> 03:08:57,160
“Ask Lin McLean.

2137
03:08:57,160 --> 03:09:05,960
Ask him that sets bulls on folks and steals slippers, what he’s done with our
innocent lambs, mixing them up with other people’s coughing, unhealthy brats.

2138
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:20,320
That’s Charlie Taylor in Alfred’s clothes, and I know Alfred didn’t cough like that, and I said to you it
was strange; and the other one that’s been put in Christopher’s new quilts is not even a bub⁠—bub⁠—boy!”

2139
03:09:20,320 --> 03:09:32,680
As this crime against society loomed clear to James Westfall’s understanding, he sat down on the nearest piece
of furniture, and heedless of his wife’s tears and his exchanged children, broke into unregenerate laughter.

2140
03:09:32,680 --> 03:09:36,080
Doubtless after his sharp alarm about the bear, he was unstrung.


2141
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:56,160
His lady, however, promptly restrung him; and by the time they had repacked the now clamorous changelings, and were
rattling on their way to the Taylors’, he began to share her outraged feelings properly, as a husband and a father should;

2142
03:09:56,160 --> 03:10:22,760
but when he reached the Taylors’ and learned from Miss Wood that at this house a child had been unwrapped whom nobody could at all identify, and that Mr.
and Mrs. Taylor were already far on the road to the Swintons’, James Westfall whipped up his horses and grew almost as thirsty for revenge as was his wife.

2143
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:36,640
Where the steer had been roasted, the powdered ashes were now cold white, and Mr. McLean, feeling through his
dreams the change of dawn come over the air, sat up cautiously among the outdoor slumberers and waked his neighbor.

2144
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:40,080
“Day will be soon,” he whispered, “and we must light out of this.


2145
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:45,080
I never suspicioned yu’ had that much of the devil in you before.”


2146
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:52,400
“I reckon some of the fellows will act haidstrong,” the
Virginian murmured luxuriously, among the warmth of his blankets.

2147
03:10:52,400 --> 03:11:01,800
“I tell yu’ we must skip,” said Lin, for the second time; and
he rubbed the Virginian’s black head, which alone was visible.

2148
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:10,000
“Skip, then, you,” came muffled from within, “and keep you’self
mighty sca’ce till they can appreciate our frolic.”

2149
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:16,960
The Southerner withdrew deeper into his bed, and Mr. McLean,
informing him that he was a fool, arose and saddled his horse.

2150
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:23,200
From the saddlebag, he brought a parcel, and lightly laying this
beside Bokay Baldy, he mounted and was gone.

2151
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:28,760
When Baldy awoke later, he found the parcel to be a pair of flowery
slippers.

2152
03:11:28,760 --> 03:11:34,360
In selecting the inert Virginian as the fool, Mr. McLean was
scarcely wise; it is the absent who are always guilty.

2153
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:40,400
Before ever Lin could have been a mile in retreat, the rattle
of the wheels roused all of them, and here came the Taylors.

2154
03:11:40,400 --> 03:12:01,560
Before the Taylors’ knocking had brought the Swintons to their door, other wheels sounded, and here were Mr. and Mrs. Carmody, and Uncle Hughey with his wife, and close
after them Mr. Dow, alone, who told how his wife had gone into one of her fits⁠—she upon whom Dr. Barker at Drybone had enjoined total abstinence from all excitement.

2155
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:07,440
Voices of women and children began to be uplifted; the Westfalls
arrived in a lather, and the Thomases;

2156
03:12:07,440 --> 03:12:19,120
and by sunrise, what with fathers and mothers and spectators and loud offspring, there was
gathered such a meeting as has seldom been before among the generations of speaking men.

2157
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:24,680
Today you can hear legends of it from Texas to Montana; but I
am giving you the full particulars.

2158
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:27,280
Of course they pitched upon poor Lin.

2159
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:34,600
Here was the Virginian doing his best, holding horses and helping ladies
descend, while the name of McLean began to be muttered with threats.

2160
03:12:34,600 --> 03:12:42,680
Soon a party led by Mr. Dow set forth in search of him, and the Southerner
debated a moment if he had better not put them on a wrong track.

2161
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:46,120
But he concluded that they might safely go on searching.

2162
03:12:46,120 --> 03:12:55,080
Mrs. Westfall found Christopher at once in the green shawl of Anna
Maria Dow, but all was not achieved thus in the twinkling of an eye.

2163
03:12:55,080 --> 03:13:05,800
Mr. McLean had, it appeared, as James Westfall lugubriously pointed out, not merely “swapped
the duds; he had shuffled the whole doggone deck;” and they cursed this Satanic invention.

2164
03:13:05,800 --> 03:13:22,120
The fathers were but of moderate assistance; it was the mothers who did the heavy work; and by ten o’clock some unsolved problems grew
so delicate that a ladies’ caucus was organized in a private room⁠—no admittance for men⁠—and what was done there I can only surmise.

2165
03:13:22,120 --> 03:13:24,720
During its progress the search party returned.

2166
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:27,200
It had not found Mr. McLean.

2167
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:32,320
It had found a tree with a notice pegged upon it, reading, “God
bless our home!”

2168
03:13:32,320 --> 03:13:32,840
This was captured.

2169
03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:42,680
But success attended the caucus; each mother emerged, satisfied that she had received her own,
and each sire, now that his family was itself again, began to look at his neighbor sideways.

2170
03:13:42,680 --> 03:14:00,160
After a man has been angry enough to kill another man, after the fire of righteous slaughter has raged in his heart
as it had certainly raged for several hours in the hearts of these fathers, the flame will usually burn itself out.

2171
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:08,040
This will be so in a generous nature, unless the cause of the
anger is still unchanged.

2172
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:12,920
But the children had been identified; none had taken hurt.

2173
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:15,120
All had been humanely given their nourishment.

2174
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:16,560
The thing was over.

2175
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:17,680
The day was beautiful.

2176
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:20,040
A tempting feast remained from the barbecue.

2177
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:22,280
These Bear Creek fathers could not keep their ire at red heat.


2178
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:27,520
Most of them, being as yet more their wives’ lovers than their
children’s parents

2179
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:34,520
, began to see the mirthful side of the adventure; and they ceased
to feel very severely toward Lin McLean.

2180
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:36,760
Not so the women.

2181
03:14:36,760 --> 03:14:40,960
They cried for vengeance; but they cried in vain, and were met
with smiles.

2182
03:14:40,960 --> 03:14:48,040
Mrs. Westfall argued long that punishment should be dealt the
offender.

2183
03:14:48,040 --> 03:14:55,480
“Anyway,” she persisted, “it was real defiant of him putting
that up on the tree.

2184
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:59,000
I might forgive him but for that.”

2185
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:02,360
“Yes,” spoke the Virginian in their midst, “that wasn’t sort
o’ right.

2186
03:15:02,360 --> 03:15:04,440
Especially as I am the man you’re huntin’.”

2187
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:05,720
They sat dumb at his assurance.

2188
03:15:05,720 --> 03:15:10,400
“Come and kill me,” he continued, round upon the party.

2189
03:15:10,400 --> 03:15:11,120
“I’ll not resist.”

2190
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:14,360
But they could not resist the way in which he had looked round
upon them.

2191
03:15:14,360 --> 03:15:18,840
He had chosen the right moment for his confession, as a captain
of a horse awaits the proper time for a charge.

2192
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:22,800
Some rebukes he did receive; the worst came from the mothers.


2193
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:26,520
And all that he could say for himself was, “I am getting off
too easy.”

2194
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:28,960
“But what was your point?” said Westfall.

2195
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:34,320
“Blamed if I know any more. I expect it must have been the whiskey.”


2196
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:40,360
“I would mind it less,” said Mrs. Westfall, “if you looked a
bit sorry or ashamed.”

2197
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:43,960
The Virginian shook his head at her penitently.

2198
03:15:43,960 --> 03:15:48,680
“I’m tryin’ to,” he said.

2199
03:15:48,680 --> 03:15:57,400
And thus he sat disarming his accusers until they began to lunch
upon the copious remnants of the barbecue.

2200
03:15:57,400 --> 03:15:58,600
He did not join them at this meal.

2201
03:15:58,600 --> 03:16:07,800
In telling you that Mrs. Dow was the only lady absent upon this
historic morning, I was guilty of an inadvertence.

2202
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:09,440
There was one other.

2203
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:18,240
The Virginian rode away sedately through the autumn sunshine;
and as he went he asked his Monte horse a question.

2204
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:23,280
“Do yu’ reckon she’ll have forgotten you too, you pie-biter?”
said he.

2205
03:16:23,280 --> 03:16:28,840
Instead of the new trousers, the cowpuncher’s leathern chaps
were on his legs.

2206
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:30,840
But he had the new scarf knotted at his neck.

2207
03:16:30,840 --> 03:16:34,400
Most men would gladly have equalled him in appearance.

2208
03:16:34,400 --> 03:16:39,080
“You Monte,” said he, “will she be at home?”

2209
03:16:39,080 --> 03:16:45,120
It was Sunday, and no school day, and he found her in her cabin
that stood next the Taylors’ house.

2210
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:46,880
Her eyes were very bright.

2211
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:49,280
“I’d thought I’d just call,” said he.

2212
03:16:49,280 --> 03:16:53,880
“Why, that’s such a pity! Mr. and Mrs. Taylor are away.”

2213
03:16:53,880 --> 03:17:00,200
“Yes; they’ve been right busy. That’s why I thought I’d call.
Will yu’ come for a ride, ma’am?”

2214
03:17:00,200 --> 03:17:01,000
“Dear me! I⁠—”

2215
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,880
“You can ride my hawss. He’s gentle.”

2216
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:03,200
“What! And you walk?”

2217
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:07,400
“No, ma’am. Nor the two of us ride him this time, either.”

2218
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:13,320
At this she turned entirely pink, and he, noticing, went on quietly:
“I’ll catch up one of Taylor’s hawsses.

2219
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:14,160
Taylor knows me.”

2220
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:15,000
“No.

2221
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:16,800
I don’t really think I could do that.

2222
03:17:16,800 --> 03:17:19,040
But thank you.

2223
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:20,720
Thank you very much.

2224
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:23,840
I must go now and see how Mrs. Taylor’s fire is.”

2225
03:17:23,840 --> 03:17:26,320
“I’ll look after that, ma’am.

2226
03:17:26,320 --> 03:17:29,120
I’d like for yu’ to go ridin’ mighty well.

2227
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:34,800
Yu’ have no babies this mawnin’ to be anxious after.”

2228
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:44,600
At this shaft, Grandmother Stark flashed awake deep within the
spirit of her descendant, and she made a haughty declaration of war.

2229
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:47,400
“I don’t know what you mean, sir,” she said.

2230
03:17:47,400 --> 03:17:54,680
Now was his danger; for it was easy to fall into mere crude
impertinence and ask her why, then, did she speak thus abruptly?

2231
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:58,760
There were various easy things of this kind for him to say.

2232
03:17:58,760 --> 03:18:02,280
And any rudeness would have lost him the battle.

2233
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:08,880
But the Virginian was not the man to lose such a battle in such
a way.

2234
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:10,160
His shaft had hit.

2235
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:16,760
She thought he referred to those babies about whom last night
she had shown such superfluous solicitude.

2236
03:18:16,760 --> 03:18:18,120
Her conscience was guilty.

2237
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:22,960
This was all that he had wished to make sure of before he began
operations.

2238
03:18:22,960 --> 03:18:29,240
“Why, I mean,” said he, easily, sitting down near the door, “that
it’s Sunday.

2239
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:33,520
School don’t hinder yu’ from enjoyin’ a ride today.

2240
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:37,120
You’ll teach the kids all the better for it tomorro’, ma’am.

2241
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:38,680
Maybe it’s your duty.”

2242
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:40,240
And he smiled at her.

2243
03:18:40,240 --> 03:18:42,680
“My duty! It’s quite novel to have strangers⁠—”

2244
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:45,080
“Am I a stranger?” he cut in, firing his first broadside.

2245
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:50,560
“I was introduced, ma’am,” he continued, noting how she had flushed
again.

2246
03:18:50,560 --> 03:18:54,480
“And I would not be oversteppin’ for the world. I’ll go away
if yu’ want.”

2247
03:18:54,480 --> 03:18:57,560
And hereupon he quietly rose, and stood, hat in hand.

2248
03:18:57,560 --> 03:18:58,160
Molly was flustered.

2249
03:18:58,160 --> 03:19:00,760
She did not at all want him to go.

2250
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:03,920
No one of her admirers had ever been like this creature.

2251
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:14,480
The fringed leathern chaparreros, the cartridge belt, the flannel shirt,
the knotted scarf at the neck, these things were now an old story to her.

2252
03:19:14,480 --> 03:19:19,800
Since her arrival she had seen young men and old in plenty dressed
thus.

2253
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:25,600
But worn by this man now standing by her door, they seemed to
radiate romance.

2254
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:28,640
She did not want him to go⁠—and she wished to win her battle.


2255
03:19:28,640 --> 03:19:33,720
And now in her agitation she became suddenly severe, as she had
done at Hoosic Junction.

2256
03:19:33,720 --> 03:19:35,600
He should have a punishment to remember!

2257
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:38,920
“You call yourself a man, I suppose,” she said.

2258
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:42,680
But he did not tremble in the least.

2259
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:47,160
Her fierceness filled him with delight, and the tender desire
of ownership flooded through him.

2260
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:51,160
“A grown-up, responsible man,” she repeated.

2261
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:53,880
“Yes, ma’am. I think so.”

2262
03:19:53,880 --> 03:19:55,080
He now sat down again.

2263
03:19:55,080 --> 03:20:01,760
“And you let them think that⁠—that Mr. McLean⁠—You dare not look
me in the face and say that Mr. McLean did that last night!”

2264
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:02,720
“I reckon I dassent.”

2265
03:20:02,720 --> 03:20:05,960
“There! I knew it! I said so from the first!”

2266
03:20:05,960 --> 03:20:08,880
“And me a stranger to you!” he murmured.

2267
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,480
It was his second broadside.

2268
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:12,440
It left her badly crippled.

2269
03:20:12,440 --> 03:20:13,640
She was silent.

2270
03:20:13,640 --> 03:20:16,640
“Who did yu’ mention it to, ma’am?”

2271
03:20:16,640 --> 03:20:18,400
She hoped she had him.

2272
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:21,280
“Why, are you afraid?”

2273
03:20:21,280 --> 03:20:22,600
And she laughed lightly.

2274
03:20:22,600 --> 03:20:24,840
“I told ’em myself.

2275
03:20:24,840 --> 03:20:33,560
And their astonishment seemed so genu-wine I’d just hate to think they had
fooled me that thorough when they knowed it all along from you seeing me.”

2276
03:20:33,560 --> 03:20:34,200
“I did not see you.

2277
03:20:34,200 --> 03:20:37,360
I knew it must⁠—of course I did not tell anyone.

2278
03:20:37,360 --> 03:20:42,520
When I said I said so from the first, I meant⁠—you can understand
perfectly what I meant.”

2279
03:20:42,520 --> 03:20:43,600
“Yes, ma’am.”

2280
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:45,040
Poor Molly was near stamping her foot.

2281
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:48,760
“And what sort of a trick,” she rushed on, “was that to play?


2282
03:20:48,760 --> 03:20:53,880
Do you call it a manly thing to frighten and distress women because
you⁠—for no reason at all?

2283
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:58,920
I should never have imagined it could be the act of a person
who wears a big pistol and rides a big horse.

2284
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:03,120
I should be afraid to go riding with such an immature protector.”


2285
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:05,680
“Yes; that was awful childish.

2286
03:21:05,680 --> 03:21:13,520
Your words do cut a little; for maybe there’s been times when
I have acted pretty near like a man.

2287
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:16,840
But I cert’nly forgot to be introduced before I spoke to yu’
last night.

2288
03:21:16,840 --> 03:21:18,480
Because why?

2289
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:20,840
You’ve found me out dead in one thing.

2290
03:21:20,840 --> 03:21:22,720
Won’t you take a guess at this too?”

2291
03:21:22,720 --> 03:21:27,680
“I cannot sit guessing why people do not behave themselves⁠—who
seem to know better.”

2292
03:21:27,680 --> 03:21:29,960
“Well, ma’am, I’ve played square and owned up to yu’.

2293
03:21:29,960 --> 03:21:32,840
And that’s not what you’re doin’ by me.

2294
03:21:32,840 --> 03:21:39,200
I ask your pardon if I say what I have a right to say in language
not as good as I’d like to talk to yu’ with.

2295
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:42,560
But at South Fork Crossin’ who did any introducin’?

2296
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:43,640
Did yu’ complain I was a stranger then?”

2297
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:49,600
“I⁠—no!” she flashed out; then, quite sweetly, “The driver told
me it wasn’t really so dangerous there, you know.”

2298
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:52,160
“That’s not the point I’m makin’.

2299
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:53,360
You are a grown-up woman, a responsible woman.

2300
03:21:53,360 --> 03:22:04,640
You’ve come ever so far, and all alone, to a rough country to instruct young children that
play games⁠—tag, and hide-and-seek, and fooleries they’ll have to quit when they get old.

2301
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:18,160
Don’t you think pretendin’ yu’ don’t know a man⁠—his name’s nothin’, but him⁠—a man whom you were glad enough to
let assist yu’ when somebody was needed⁠—don’t you think that’s mighty close to hide-and-seek them children plays?

2302
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:22,880
I ain’t so sure but what there’s a pair of us children in this
hyeh room.”

2303
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:24,680
Molly Wood was regarding him saucily.

2304
03:22:24,680 --> 03:22:28,240
“I don’t think I like you,” said she.

2305
03:22:28,240 --> 03:22:34,560
“That’s all square enough. You’re goin’ to love me before we
get through. I wish yu’d come a-ridin, ma’am.”

2306
03:22:34,560 --> 03:22:35,240
“Dear, dear, dear!

2307
03:22:35,240 --> 03:22:36,880
So I’m going to love you?

2308
03:22:36,880 --> 03:22:37,640
How will you do it?

2309
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:44,600
I know men think that they only need to sit and look strong and
make chests at a girl⁠—”

2310
03:22:44,600 --> 03:22:48,240
“Goodness gracious! I ain’t makin’ any chests at yu’!”

2311
03:22:48,240 --> 03:22:52,520
Laughter overcame him for a moment, and Miss Wood liked his laugh
very much.

2312
03:22:52,520 --> 03:22:54,480
“Please come a-ridin’,” he urged.

2313
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:56,560
“It’s the prettiest kind of a day.”

2314
03:22:56,560 --> 03:22:59,120
She looked at him frankly, and there was a pause.

2315
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:06,000
“I will take back two things that I said to you,” she then answered
him.

2316
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:07,480
“I believe that I do like you.

2317
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:15,760
And I know that if I went riding with you, I should not have
an immature protector.”

2318
03:23:15,760 --> 03:23:23,880
And then, with a final gesture of acknowledgment, she held out
her hand to him.

2319
03:23:23,880 --> 03:23:30,080
“And I have always wanted,” she said, “to thank you for what
you did at the river.”

2320
03:23:30,080 --> 03:23:33,920
He took her hand, and his heart bounded.

2321
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:37,120
“You’re a gentleman!” he exclaimed.

2322
03:23:37,120 --> 03:23:41,160
It was now her turn to be overcome with merriment.

2323
03:23:41,160 --> 03:23:44,720
“I’ve always wanted to be a man,” she said.

2324
03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:47,600
“I am mighty glad you ain’t,” said he, looking at her.

2325
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:51,760
But Molly had already received enough broadsides for one day.


2326
03:23:51,760 --> 03:23:56,920
She could allow no more of them, and she took herself capably
in hand.

2327
03:23:56,920 --> 03:24:00,480
“Where did you learn to make such pretty speeches?” she asked.


2328
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:06,040
“Well, never mind that. One sees that you have had plenty of
practice for one so young.”

2329
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:13,760
“I am twenty-seven,” blurted the Virginian, and knew instantly
that he had spoken like a fool.

2330
03:24:13,760 --> 03:24:18,800
“Who would have dreamed it!” said Molly, with well-measured mockery.


2331
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:24,120
She knew that she had scored at last, and that this day was hers.


2332
03:24:24,120 --> 03:24:27,280
“Don’t be too sure you are glad I’m not a man,” she now told
him.

2333
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:30,680
There was something like a challenge in her voice.

2334
03:24:30,680 --> 03:24:33,080
“I risk it,” he remarked.

2335
03:24:33,080 --> 03:24:38,000
“For I am almost twenty-three myself,” she concluded.

2336
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:41,120
And she gave him a look on her own account.

2337
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:44,640
“And you’ll not come a-ridin’?” he persisted.

2338
03:24:44,640 --> 03:24:49,640
“No,” she answered him; “no.”

2339
03:24:49,640 --> 03:24:52,200
And he knew that he could not make her.

2340
03:24:52,200 --> 03:24:55,280
“Then I will tell yu’ goodbye,” said he.

2341
03:24:55,280 --> 03:24:59,440
“But I am comin’ again. And next time I’ll have along a gentle
hawss for yu’.”

2342
03:24:59,440 --> 03:25:02,123
“Next time!
