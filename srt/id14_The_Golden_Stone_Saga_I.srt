CHAPTER ONE
The Snowstorm

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,000
William Goldstone was not the most sociable
boy.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,810
He never seemed to have as many friends as
the other children in his school, and as he

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,950
wasn't really keen on sport, he spent most
of his spare time watching videos and playing

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,090
with his electronic games.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,730
His parents had decided to leave him with
his grandfather for a week.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,650
As Grandfather Howard lived in a mountain
cabin, they thought that William might find

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,050
interest in the countryside, rather than watching
more TV.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,190
So Howard had taken him on several walks through
the forest, and the two of them had spent

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:56,170
many hours fishing in a nearby river where
William managed to catch a few fish.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,810
Snow had been falling for the past two days,
and Howard helped his grandson build a family

12
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,830
of snowmen.

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,140
They were rather small because there hadn't
been much snow.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,409
However, they would soon see a lot more.

15
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,409
"Grandfather!"

16
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,660
"What is it, William?"

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,080
"What time will they get here?"

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,400
"Well, if they left on time, I'd say around
seven o'clock.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
Mind you, the weather has become much worse..."

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,010
"How can it be 'worse'?

21
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,299
I think it's great!

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,070
Anyway, I thought you liked the snow."

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,710
"Of course I do.

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,570
Though not as much as I did when I was your
age."

25
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,320
"Do you want to go outside and build another
snowman?"

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,930
"Not right now.

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,580
And neither do you.

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,780
It'll be getting dark soon, and a lot colder
as well."

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,270
"But I'm leaving tomorrow, and we never see
snow like this at home.

30
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,440
Can't I build just one more?"

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,190
"I'll tell you what.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,510
When your parents arrive, I'll suggest that
you all stay here for the night.

33
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,470
Then you can build your snowman in the morning
when the snow has settled."

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,470
"Great!

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,840
With all the snow that's falling now, it'll
be ten times as big as the others!"

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,400
"So what do you want to do in the meantime,
William?"

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,349
"Let's see what's on TV!"

38
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,180
William turned on the TV and began watching
one of his favourite series, while Howard

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,269
stared out into the night, worried that his
daughter and her husband might be caught in

40
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,480
the snowstorm.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,739
All of a sudden, the TV picture disappeared
and the lamplight faded, leaving the roaring

42
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,500
log fire to continue making shadows by itself.

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,409
William was very disappointed.

44
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,040
"Oh no!

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,450
It was just getting to the most exciting part!"

46
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,909
"It must be a power failure."

47
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,950
Howard tried turning on some of the light
switches and changing some fuses, but with

48
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,360
no success.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,069
"Yes, the electricity's out completely.

50
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,030
I think we can blame the snow for that."

51
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,299
"So what do we do now?"

52
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,309
"How about if I read you a story?"

53
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:13,309
"Huh!

54
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,309
Boredom City."

55
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:18,890
"How can you say that when you don't even
know what it's all about?

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,590
Have today's children given up on books completely?"

57
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,769
William wasn't exactly thrilled by the idea,
but he couldn't think of another.

58
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,739
"Okay, what is it about?"

59
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,849
"Oh, it's a wonderful story, full of danger
and adventure..."

60
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,180
"Is there a really evil villain?"

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,409
"The most evil one."

62
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,409
"And the hero?

63
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,969
There's got to be a hero.

64
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:43,969
Is he brave?

65
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:45,310
Is he strong?"

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,849
"Like no other man!"

67
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:55,219
Howard, now happy and a little excited, went
to his bookcase and produced a large, leather-bound

68
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,400
book.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,760
On the cover was a symbol: a crescent moon,
with a tiny circle of gold sparkling near

70
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,510
the moon's lower point.

71
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,569
The old man blew what looked like half an
inch of dust from the top of the book's pages.

72
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,190
"I've not read this for years."

73
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,230
William and Howard sat before the fireplace.

74
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,580
"What's the hero's name, Grandfather?"

75
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,950
"A very familiar one - you'll recognise it
straight away.

76
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:37,080
Now... the story begins on a peaceful day,
in a peaceful village set deep within a distant,

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,060
forgotten land."

78
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,110
Howard opened the book and turned to the first
page.

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:54,780
"Our hero, who at this time is a boy of about
your age, is returning home with his father

80
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:06,870
after a week of hunting..."

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,040
CHAPTER TWO
Savage Visitors

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,730
"Come along, Will."

83
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,440
Adam Goldstone's face glowed with pride as
he led his son out of the forest and down

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,120
towards their village in the valley.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Young Will was very excited.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,020
"Just wait till Mother sees what I've caught!"

87
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,690
"Hmm, seven rabbits..."

88
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,350
"And the pheasant!"

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,530
"Of course, the pheasant.

90
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,780
Together with the deer around my shoulders,
the animals in your sack will feed us for

91
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,060
quite some time."

92
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,050
"Are you proud of me, Father?"

93
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:50,990
Adam stopped walking, turned to face Will
and placed a hand on his son's shoulder.

94
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,580
"Always."

95
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,330
When they reached the village, Adam noticed
something strange.

96
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,110
There were more horses around than usual,
and there was a lot of noise coming from the

97
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,030
tavern where his wife worked.

98
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,460
Just then, Adam saw his wife walking towards
the tavern, her arms full of vegetables.

99
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,240
"Why the extra supplies, Liana?"

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
"Darling!

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,620
You're back!"

102
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,000
She put her load to one side, kissed her husband,
then knelt down and held Will's face between

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,540
her hands.

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,404
"And you, my little man... have you been learning
well?"

105
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,080
"Have a look in my sack!"

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,560
"Oh my!

107
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,990
I've never seen so many rabbits!"

108
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,640
Will's parents began whispering so as not
to worry him.

109
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,660
"Liana, what about my question?"

110
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,790
"We have visitors, Adam."

111
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,120
"I guessed as much.

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,010
But who are they?"

113
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,800
"King Ddraig and his men."

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,190
Adam was surprised and angry.

115
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,950
"What are they doing here?"

116
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,280
"They're on their way home from a battle..."

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,330
"Which, no doubt, they won."

118
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,010
"Of course."

119
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,010
"Pity."

120
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,030
Few people liked King Ddraig.

121
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,990
Those who did were sitting with him in the
tavern.

122
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:16,820
The soldiers fell on their food like wolves,
made a lot of noise, and created an awful

123
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
mess.

124
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
"General Shivan!

125
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,360
How many enemies did we kill today?"

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,690
"Equal to that of all previous battles put
together, Your Majesty."

127
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,630
"May all who oppose me shudder when they hear
my name.

128
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,650
May they scream when they learn its true meaning."

129
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,810
"Death!"

130
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,980
"Destruction!"

131
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,140
"Rage!"

132
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,300
"Agony!"

133
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,460
"Grief!"

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,120
"But, Father, I'm hungry.

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,510
Why can't I eat with you in the tavern?"

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,100
"Will, I'm not going there to eat.

137
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm going there to look after your mother."

138
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
"Why?"

139
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,800
"Because King Ddraig is in there."

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,580
"I've heard stories about him."

141
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,950
"Then you must know why I'm concerned."

142
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,600
After a brief silence, Adam smiled and stroked
his son's fair hair.

143
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,740
"Don't you worry - that's my job.

144
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,310
Everything will be fine once Ddraig has left.

145
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,840
And then, we'll cook your pheasant.

146
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,280
All right?"

147
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,090
Will gave an unsure smile and nodded.

148
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:31,470
Adam left the family hut, closed the door
behind him, breathed in deeply and set off

149
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,250
towards the tavern.

150
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,020
Liana was busy preparing more food for the
warriors when her husband appeared in the

151
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
doorway.

152
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,120
"Is everything okay, Liana?"

153
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,899
"So far so good."

154
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,879
"I'll be watching things from that table over
there."

155
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,649
"Take this jug of ale - you'll look more relaxed."

156
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,059
Evening turned to night without a problem
in sight.

157
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,939
Then it happened.

158
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:04,139
Ddraig had been watching a beautiful young
serving girl throughout the feast and now,

159
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:09,860
drunk on ale and his own importance, demanded
the girl's company.

160
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,370
That was when her fiance spoke up:

161
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,040
"Keep your hands off her!"

162
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,279
The tavern was suddenly silent, with tension
creeping from every corner.

163
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,139
"Who dares "instruct" me?"

164
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:25,999
"I do!"

165
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:26,999
"Why?

166
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,990
Why should my pleasure concern you?"

167
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,839
"Because that girl is engaged to me!"

168
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,809
"Oh, I see.

169
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:37,470
Well, young man, engagements can be broken.

170
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,980
I think the lady should be given the chance
to choose which of us she prefers."

171
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,089
Ddraig turned back to the girl who was now
trembling.

172
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,459
"What is your name, dear?"

173
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,459
"Ava.

174
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,459
My...

175
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,410
my name is Ava."

176
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,459
"Ava.

177
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,689
Such a beautiful name.

178
00:09:54,689 --> 00:10:00,730
Well, Ava, it appears that your loveliness
is the cause of competition.

179
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,430
Between your brave fiance and... and King
Ddraig.

180
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,300
King Ddraig who is feared throughout the land,
whose name is legendary and who is certainly

181
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,740
not known for backing away from a challenge.

182
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
So...

183
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Ava...

184
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,680
Which one do you really prefer, hmm?"

185
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,149
Ava couldn't bear the thought of becoming
Ddraig's companion, but neither could she

186
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,209
watch her fiance be killed.

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:31,550
After thinking long and hard, she slowly approached
the dreaded king.

188
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,689
"Ava, what are you doing?"

189
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:35,149
"I'm sorry..."

190
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:39,899
"There you are - proof that engagements can
indeed be broken."

191
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,149
The young man picked up a large stone jug,
raised it high in the air and rushed towards

192
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,240
Ddraig:

193
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,800
"As can heads!"

194
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,839
"Absolutely!"

195
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,480
Ddraig stood up and punched the young man's
stomach.

196
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,689
He then grabbed the jug and hit the youth's
head with it.

197
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:00,699
In an instant, he lay dead.

198
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:06,499
Ava let out a deafening scream and the villagers'
anger grew.

199
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,930
Without thinking of the odds, they advanced
upon the King and his men.

200
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,040
Adam was their leader.

201
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,680
"You unspeakable murderer, Ddraig!

202
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,809
That boy was not even hall your age!"

203
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,269
"My heart bleeds."

204
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,060
"Oh, I shall make sure of that!"

205
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,610
Adam picked up a carving knife but before
he could do anything, Shivan grabbed him by

206
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,980
the throat and began lifting him up off the
ground.

207
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,410
Fearing that her husband's neck would soon
be broken, Liana rushed across the tavern,

208
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,199
holding a bowl of hot broth which she poured
into Shivan's face.

209
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:52,060
Having heard the noises from within the tavern,
Will left the safety of the hut and crept

210
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,230
towards a hole in the tavern wall.

211
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,610
Looking through the hole, he saw that a great
fight had now begun.

212
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,350
Wherever he looked, chairs were being broken
against men's backs, and as the sword and

213
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,459
knife fight carried on in the candlelight,
the straw-covered floor became more and more

214
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,620
red from his neighbours blood.

215
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:19,230
He could no longer see his father but he saw
his mother, and as she struggled with the

216
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,480
furious Shivan, she caught sight of her son
through the hole.

217
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,970
"Run, Will!"

218
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,970
"But...!"

219
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,959
"Forget about us!

220
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,449
Save yourself!"

221
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,129
Will couldn't do it at first - he had to at
least try to help.

222
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:41,220
But he soon realized that there was nothing
he could do, so he ran off sobbing into the

223
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,420
night.

224
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,730
Some time later, Will found himself at the
edge of the forest, exhausted.

225
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,970
He turned and looked back down into the valley
and saw that Ddraig had set the village on

226
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,079
fire.

227
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,509
His parents, his home...

228
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,459
everything he knew was now gone forever.

229
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,800
Tears welled up in his eyes.

230
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,870
They were not only tears of sadness and sorrow.

231
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:32,720
They were the tears of a ten year-old's rage.

232
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,069
CHAPTER THREE
Kylan the Wizard

233
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:44,939
The sun shone high in the sky and it was very
hot.

234
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:49,330
Will wondered if the sun was angry at what
had happened.

235
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,959
Tired and hungry, he looked around for something
to eat but as he had already passed through

236
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,009
the forest and was now in the middle of a
barren, rocky plain, there seemed little chance

237
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,029
of finding food anywhere.

238
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,189
Suddenly, he caught sight of a tiny lizard.

239
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:13,949
He was so hungry that he picked up a stone
and aimed it at the creature.

240
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:21,160
Then he realized that he would have to eat
it raw and he began to feel sick in the stomach.

241
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,660
He became dizzy, the stone fell from his fingers,
and he fainted.

242
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:36,550
Lying on the grey, dusty ground, he soon fell
into a deep and troubled sleep.

243
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,179
The smell of smoke reminded Will of the burning
village.

244
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:47,249
He woke up with a scream but soon found out
where the smell was coming from - a blazing

245
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:50,739
fire in the center of the cave in which he
now lay.

246
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:59,329
The cave seemed a nice place to be, and the
hand that stroked his head was very comforting.

247
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:03,309
Will turned and saw the man who had rescued
him.

248
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:10,579
He wore a long red robe, and a thin band of
gold around his bald head.

249
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:16,279
As his face was covered with wrinkles, and
as his small beard was completely white, it

250
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,610
was clear that the man was very, very old.

251
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,929
However, he spoke with the voice of someone
many years younger.

252
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,550
"Do you feel well enough to talk?"

253
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,670
Will nodded, looking a little scared.

254
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,440
"Who are you?"

255
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,389
"You wouldn't be able to pronounce the name
I was given when I was born.

256
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,529
Most people call me Kylan.

257
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:44,930
Although you're the first person I've actually
met in over fifty years."

258
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,160
Will had heard the man's name before.

259
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,689
"Are you a wizard?"

260
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:49,879
"Does it show?"

261
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,879
"Well...

262
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,939
I've heard many stories about you."

263
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:55,040
"And what do these stories say?"

264
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,300
"That you're the kindest, wisest and most
powerful magician in the whole world."

265
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,430
Kylan was pleased.

266
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,069
"It's nice to know that history is being recorded
correctly.

267
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:10,500
Now then, young man, what do I call you?"

268
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
"Will.

269
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Will Goldstone."

270
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
"How appropriate..."

271
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,129
"What did you say?"

272
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,339
"Oh, nothing."

273
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:19,279
A short while passed before Will asked:

274
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,649
"How long have I been in your cave, Kylan?"

275
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,449
"It's been two days now.

276
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,860
You looked very sick when I found you.

277
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,759
But thanks to some bathing and a bit of low-level
magic, your bruises, cuts and sunburn have

278
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,369
almost faded away.

279
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,369
Although.

280
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,110
I don't think that mark on your chest will
ever leave you.

281
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,939
What can you tell me about it?"

282
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:48,319
Will opened his sack-cloth shirt and looked
at the birthmark - a crescent moon and a tiny

283
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,319
circle.

284
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,300
"I've always had it.

285
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Do you know what it means?"

286
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,899
"No, I'm afraid that I don't."

287
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,240
Kylan was lying.

288
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,079
As the night went on, Will told Kylan about
all that had happened.

289
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,470
The wizard said that Will could stay with
him for as long as he liked.

290
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,690
Will thought that the wizard had told him
that out of sympathy.

291
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:19,680
However, Kylan had realized how important
Will was the moment he first saw the birthmark.

292
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,830
He said no more about it.

293
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,610
Neither did he invite Will to learn about
his magic.

294
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,890
Will would have to ask for that himself.

295
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:36,470
The years went by and Will's hatred of Ddraig
grew.

296
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,500
He never spoke of it because he knew that
Kylan didn't approve of revenge.

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,300
However, Kylan also wanted to see Ddraig killed.

298
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,780
He wanted it to happen so that the world could
once again, be at peace.

299
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,420
Will realized that he needed to find new talents,
within himself.

300
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,730
He often saw Kylan practicing his magic, but
this was something that could never be taught.

301
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,670
What Kylan could teach him was how to focus
his mind and spirit so that he could use his

302
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,250
body to the full.

303
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:21,150
So when Kylan forgot to block off the entrance
to his training chamber, Will crept in to

304
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,020
see what the wizard was up to.

305
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,911
"I knew that passage must lead to another
cave, but I would never have imagined that

306
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,680
it would be so big!"

307
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:37,920
Thanks to the power of magic, the vast stone
chamber was filled with grass, bushes and

308
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
trees.

309
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,600
It was where Kylan got his food and the place
where he practiced, his own special kind of

310
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
martial arts.

311
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,150
Will watched with amazement as Kylan, his
eyes closed all the time, jumped, twirled

312
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,170
and sailed through the air.

313
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:04,200
He leapt from branch to branch before flying
head over heels towards the statue in the

314
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,630
center of the chamber.

315
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:13,930
It was a statue of Dayzan, the sun god, and
Kylan was now standing on its head with one

316
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,930
foot.

317
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,600
"You landed on each of those branches for
only an instant - you hardly even touched

318
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,670
them!

319
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,530
How can a man move with such speed and grace?!"

320
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,530
"Practice."

321
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,410
"If I could move like that!"

322
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,350
"You can if you want to.

323
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,601
With these skills, together with what your
father taught you about hunting, you would

324
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,430
be unstoppable."

325
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,310
Will's breathing had become heavy with excitement.

326
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,170
"Teach me!

327
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,170
Please!"

328
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,530
Kylan smiled and opened his eyes.

329
00:19:46,530 --> 00:20:01,230
"I would be glad to."

330
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,630
CHAPTER FOUR
Delena

331
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:12,570
Will sat beside the smoking remains of the
previous night's fire.

332
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,290
Kylan appeared carrying something wrapped
in a piece of leather, and sat down opposite

333
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,440
the young man.

334
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,610
He poured two cups of sweet red wine, one
of which he passed to Will.

335
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,430
He held the other high in the air:

336
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,540
"To Dayzan.

337
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,770
To the power of good.

338
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,070
To Will Goldstone, on his twenty-fifth birthday."

339
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,240
They both sipped their wine.

340
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,660
"You've been so good to me, Kylan."

341
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,530
"And so I always shall.

342
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,140
Even though you will be far away from here
by tonight."

343
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,050
"What do you mean?"

344
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,241
"Will, you're a man now.

345
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:54,820
A man of great power and skill.

346
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,660
What's the use of things like those you've
learnt in a cave so far from civilization?

347
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,340
See the world, Will.

348
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,160
Fulfil your destiny."

349
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,520
"My destiny?"

350
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,100
"All men will know their destiny.

351
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,780
Some more than others.

352
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,510
Yours is perhaps the most important in our
history."

353
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,190
"What is my destiny?"

354
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,740
"That I cannot tell you."

355
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
"Can't?

356
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
Or won't?"

357
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,140
"It will all come clear soon enough.

358
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,230
And when it does, you will find it very much
to your liking, that much I will tell you."

359
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,150
There was a long silence.

360
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,210
Will looked at Kylan with a smile and a tear.

361
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,260
"I wish we could always be together."

362
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,840
Kylan passed Will the leather-bound present.

363
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,730
"And so we shall."

364
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,160
Will unwrapped the gift.

365
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,150
It was a shiny gold headband, just like the
one Kylan wore.

366
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,610
"What's this?"

367
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,980
"A symbol of all you've achieved here.

368
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
Wear it always.

369
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,320
It will keep us in mind of each other."

370
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:13,990
Since leaving Kylan's cave, Will had spent
five years travelling far and wide - through

371
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:20,780
forests, through the wilderness - and had
spent time in each village he found.

372
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:28,200
He was now in the city of Galabis, which was
of great interest to Will for two reasons.

373
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,890
First of all, it was the biggest and busiest
place that he had ever seen.

374
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:41,010
More importantly, however, it was very near
the Dark Fortress, King Ddraig's home and

375
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,010
palace.

376
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,700
It stood tall upon a nearby hill, casting
a grim shadow across the city.

377
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,620
Will planned to stay in Galabis for a while,
to see what he could learn about the fortress.

378
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:03,410
But right now, he needed food and some rest,
so he made his way to the city's most popular

379
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,690
tavern.

380
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,440
Delena had come to live in Galabis when she
was seven years old.

381
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,150
Her father, a carpenter, knew he could make
more money in the city than he ever could

382
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,950
back in their village.

383
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,660
He planned to make a wealthy future for his
daughter, but both he and his wife died of

384
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,710
the sleeping sickness when Delena was ten,
so the girl began working in the tavern from

385
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,890
that early age.

386
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:42,140
The dark-haired beauty was happy where she
was although she had often dreamed of returning

387
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,860
home to see what had become of the boy she
once loved.

388
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,090
That was now impossible, however, as the village
no longer existed.

389
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,570
"A jug of ale, please."

390
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,320
As Will passed Delena a coin, their eyes met.

391
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,600
"Do I know you?"

392
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,740
"That's funny.

393
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,890
I was about to ask you the same thing.

394
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,760
You remind me of someone I knew a long time
ago."

395
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,420
"Maybe I'm the same person."

396
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
"No.

397
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
He's dead.

398
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,780
His village was destroyed ten years ago."

399
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,520
Then Will noticed her bracelet.

400
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,450
He had made it from animal hair when he was
nine.

401
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,190
"Don't you mean our village?"

402
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,460
"Yes...

403
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,480
It was where I used to live..."

404
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,200
"...Before your father realised that more
people wanted carts in Galabis.

405
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,130
Your name is Delena, isn't it?"

406
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,130
"Yes.

407
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,130
But how do you know?"

408
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,360
"I thought it was you.

409
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,930
When I saw your bracelet, I became certain.

410
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,130
I gave it to you the day you left home."

411
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,130
"Will?

412
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,130
Will Goldstone?!"

413
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,770
Will nodded.

414
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,510
Delena leapt over the wooden counter and embraced
her childhood sweetheart.

415
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:16,470
Will was happier than he had been for a very
long time.

416
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:26,010
CHAPTER FIVE
The Execution

417
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:32,390
Summer became autumn, and the love between
Will and Delena was the strongest that had

418
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,150
ever been felt.

419
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,860
So powerful were these feelings, Will's thirst
for revenge no longer seemed so important.

420
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,160
All he could think of was his future bride.

421
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,171
The wedding preparations had all been made.

422
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:54,370
The village square was filled with colourful
decorations, and a huge supply of wine stood

423
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,760
ready to flow between countless smiling lips.

424
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:05,440
It was the night before the wedding - the
next day, the couple would at long last share

425
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,900
the name of Goldstone.

426
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,210
In keeping with tradition, Will celebrated
with the friends he had made while elsewhere,

427
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,270
Delena celebrated with hers.

428
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,660
Spirits were high in the tavern, as Delena's
life-long dream was about to come true.

429
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:31,090
However, the cheers soon faded when the tavern
doors swung open and two of Ddraig's men entered.

430
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,600
"Why such happiness?

431
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,570
Is someone getting married?"

432
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,970
Delena nodded nervously.

433
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,100
"Well, I must say, you've picked a nice time
of year for it.

434
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,210
Isn't that right, Roj?"

435
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,210
"Yeah."

436
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,300
The tavern was as silent as a grave.

437
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,830
For a moment, the men looked as if they were
about to leave, and Delena breathed a sigh

438
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,900
of relief.

439
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,310
But they suddenly grabbed her and she let
out a cry.

440
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,280
"What are you doing?!"

441
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,950
"Well, you know... marriage is a very big
step.

442
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,460
You'd agree, Roj?"

443
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,970
"The biggest, Garn."

444
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,210
"And so, if you're going to take that step,
it's best to be sure about your future husband."

445
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,690
"Oh I'm sure!"

446
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,180
"How can you be when you've not looked at
the other possibilities?"

447
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,150
"What do you mean?!"

448
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:25,760
"Well, for a start, there's our boss - your
King.

449
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,170
He's always had an eye for beauty... and the
power to take it!"

450
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:37,680
Delena screamed as the men dragged her from
the tavern.

451
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:47,010
King Ddraig stood alone in the center of his
throne room.

452
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:54,510
Dressed in studded black leather and a long
cape, he was indeed a frightening figure although

453
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,350
right now, he was very bored.

454
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,520
The doors to the throne room opened and one
of his men entered.

455
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
"What is it, Garn?

456
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
Why do you disturb me?"

457
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,290
"I have a present for Your Majesty."

458
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,290
"A present?

459
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,770
It's not my birthday."

460
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,380
"Well, I heard that you were bored.

461
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,500
And, anyway!

462
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,180
You're the King!

463
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,110
His Majesty can have a birthday whenever he
wants!"

464
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,230
"Very well.

465
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,530
What is this present?"

466
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,500
"Bring her in, Roj!"

467
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,820
Delena was led into the dark, echoing throne
room.

468
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,560
"Oh, yes!

469
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,480
Happy Birthday to me indeed."

470
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,380
He advanced upon the terrified girl.

471
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,380
"What is your name, young lady?"

472
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,380
"D...

473
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,380
Delena."

474
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
"Delena.

475
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,050
A fitting name for such a beautiful creature.

476
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:54,170
Now that you're within the walls of my Dark
Fortress, tell me, er...

477
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:57,850
Delena, is it how you imagined it to be?"

478
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,850
"Worse."

479
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,780
"I suppose it could do with a woman's touch...

480
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,240
And what of me?

481
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,750
How do I make you feel?"

482
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,400
Delena could say nothing.

483
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,480
"Lost for words?

484
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,020
Well I know how you make me feel."

485
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:22,700
Ddraig began stroking her hair and she closed
her eyes in terror and disgust.

486
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,180
Finding new courage, Delena opened her eyes
and spat in Ddraig's face.

487
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,340
"I'd sooner be dead than live a life with
you!!"

488
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,400
Ddraig, his face frozen with surprise, blinked
his eyes.

489
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,730
He wiped his face clean, and smiled.

490
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,560
"Very well, my dear.

491
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,900
Your wish is my command.

492
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,180
Take her away, Roj!"

493
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,580
Delena was led quickly to an even less pleasant
part of the fortress, while Ddraig walked

494
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,920
over to Garn, who he struck with the back
of his hand.

495
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:06,280
"What sort of present do you call that?!"

496
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,930
The sun had risen, and as Will happily made
his way to the village square, he saw that

497
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,570
a large crowd had gathered.

498
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,550
He put his hand on a stranger's shoulder and
smiled.

499
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,970
"I didn't expect quite so many people at my
wedding."

500
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,350
"We're not here for a wedding.

501
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,080
It's a public execution."

502
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,460
Will was horrified.

503
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,030
"An execution?

504
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,420
Why would you come to watch such a thing?"

505
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,520
"We had to.

506
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
It's by royal command."

507
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,370
Suddenly, a terrible scream rang out and Will's
blood ran cold - something about the voice

508
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,490
sounded familiar.

509
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,830
He pushed his way to the front of the crowd
and fell to his knees when he saw Delena,

510
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,130
tied to a post with a sword through her heart.

511
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,070
He began to shiver, and he cried like a wounded
animal.

512
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,180
His voice then became a tremendous howl of
rage and agony.

513
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,270
He looked around for a weapon with which to
kill the executioner and guards.

514
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:14,730
Just then, his headband began to throb, and
he heard a voice in his head.

515
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,910
It sounded like Kylan:

516
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,080
"Do not take your revenge yet.

517
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,180
If you try, you will surely fail.

518
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,500
Leave Galabis and walk north."

519
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,890
Confused, Will touched the headband with his
finger.

520
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:58,620
"If this is destiny, Kylan, I don't like it
one bit!"

521
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,920
CHAPTER SIX
Ready to Meet Destiny

522
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:13,060
Unable to think of anything other than Delena's
death, Will continued his walk through the

523
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,060
wilderness.

524
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:20,320
He had been walking for almost a week now,
and the exhausted young man had no idea of

525
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,110
where he was going.

526
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:30,350
Eventually, he decided that he could walk
no further, so he sat down against a large

527
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,350
rock.

528
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,810
Opposite him was a cave.

529
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:40,350
As Will stared into the blackness within,
he began hearing tiny, high-pitched noises,

530
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:46,440
like echoing, musical whispers, like something
out of a dream.

531
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,630
Once more, the band around his head started
to throb, this time causing some pain.

532
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,240
He felt dizzy and his eyes were suddenly forced
shut.

533
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,600
He thought he was falling asleep, and that
he was about to meet his most troubled dream

534
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,350
in years.

535
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,500
However, Will was not dreaming.

536
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,660
Will was nowhere.

537
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,590
The voice spoke again.

538
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,650
It was definitely Kylan...

539
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,960
"I once talked about destiny.

540
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,880
I did not tell you about your own because
the time was not right."

541
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,550
"What do you mean, Kylan?"

542
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,940
"Will, the Ancient Scrolls of Dayzan tell
of much - not only of history, but of the

543
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,270
future as well.

544
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,340
King Ddraig has been ruling and ruining our
world for far too long.

545
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,120
He has lived longer than any man, and he has
used his time for one purpose - the creation

546
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,800
of misery.

547
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,550
Dayzan sent me into the world, not to destroy
Ddraig, but to find and guide the one who

548
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,890
will.

549
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,250
That man is you.

550
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,330
I thought as much when I first saw the mark
on your chest.

551
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:04,130
Since you left me, events have continued to
happen as is written in the Scrolls."

552
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,610
"Are you telling me that you knew Delena would
be killed?"

553
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,850
"Of course.

554
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,679
I could not tell you because it would have
influenced your actions.

555
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:19,330
Now you must fulfil your destiny - driven
by vengeance and armed by Dayzan...

556
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,540
In that cave, you will find Dayzan's sword
and shield.

557
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,880
They have lain hidden in there for centuries,
surrounded by a lake of fire, waiting to be

558
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,100
taken by their rightful owner."

559
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,669
"What if the wrong man tried to take them?"

560
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,700
"That man would surely die."

561
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,860
"So what if I'm not the one?"

562
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,399
"Have faith in my judgment.

563
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,650
Have faith in yourself.

564
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:50,090
You will find your mark on the shield - a
crescent moon and a crystal of pure gold."

565
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,560
"There's no such thing as a golden crystal."

566
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,419
"It is unique.

567
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:59,350
It is the Sun Crystal, the most powerful of
all those created by Dayzan.

568
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,630
It will light up the world in our most desperate
hour.

569
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:09,920
The crescent moon will free the power of the
sun, and victory will be yours.

570
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,310
People will call you 'savior'.

571
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,200
People will call you King'.

572
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,290
Enter the cave, Will Goldstone.

573
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:26,310
Take your weapons and free the world from
the shadow of Ddraig."

574
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,920
As Kylan's voice faded, Will opened his eyes.

575
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,420
Everything seemed normal again, except for
the fact that it was now night.

576
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,750
"I closed my eyes when the sun was in the
sky.

577
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,550
Now the moon is in its place."

578
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,050
Will spent a long time thinking about all
that Kylan had said.

579
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,480
He grew worried as he thought about the lake
of fire.

580
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,980
"What if Kylan is wrong about me?

581
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,300
I will burn alive!"

582
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,150
After a while, he realized that he had to
take the risk.

583
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,290
"Kylan told me to free the world from the
shadow of Ddraig.

584
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,100
I have to try.

585
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,820
I have to find out if I'm the one who can
make a difference.

586
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:17,980
I'd rather burn trying to beat that monster,
than live in a world where he is King."

587
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,820
Will stroked his birthmark as if it were a
good luck charm.

588
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,310
He stood, breathing heavily, in the mouth
of the cave.

589
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,020
The moment seemed to last forever.

590
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,930
"I must have faith in myself.

591
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,920
I must have faith in Kylan.

592
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,210
I must have faith in Dayzan."

593
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:56,140
With that thought firmly in mind, Will took
a step forward.

594
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,100
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Fight Begins

595
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,270
Will made his way through a narrow passage.

596
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:12,780
With each step came more light - fierce, orange
light - and the heat continued to increase.

597
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,390
The passage led into a huge cavern filled
with hissing lava.

598
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,500
The lava was so hot, Will could feel his face
beginning to blister.

599
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,510
Staring across the fiery lake, he saw a small
rocky mound in the center.

600
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,040
The only way it could be reached was by a
path of stepping-stones.

601
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:44,680
Some of these stones lay very far apart and
some looked too small for a man to stand on.

602
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,110
Will's clothes helped protect his skin from
the intense heat of the lava, but he knew

603
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,780
that he might pass out if he became too hot.

604
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,970
To pass out now would mean certain death,
so he removed most of his sweat-soaked clothes,

605
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:06,300
then placed a cautious foot on the first of
the stepping-stones.

606
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,911
He found that he could balance on the first
stone, but as he stepped onto the next, and

607
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:16,000
the next, he discovered that it was becoming
harder and harder to keep his balance.

608
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,520
As he stood amidst the swirling, bubbling
lake of death, he realized that it would be

609
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,480
safer for him to run across.

610
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,360
He took a deep breath and ran towards the
center of the cavern, and though he nearly

611
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,350
fell twice, he made it safely to the weapons.

612
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,790
Will examined the weapons.

613
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,750
They were the finest that he had ever seen.

614
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,070
He waved the sword high in the air so that
he could feel its weight.

615
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,090
He was even more impressed when he picked
up the shield.

616
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:55,980
The crescent moon shone in the light of the
lava, while the crystal in the center was

617
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,210
as golden as Kylan had described.

618
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,850
"Special weapons indeed.

619
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:03,790
They could make any man invincible.

620
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,150
But only one man shall hold them.

621
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,360
And that man is me.

622
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,740
Now I'll find out for sure.

623
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,060
I wasn't carrying anything when I came across,
so the real test will be whether I can get

624
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,070
out of here."

625
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:25,910
With the shield on his arm and the sword held
high, Will began to run.

626
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:32,970
Badly burned but excited and proud like never
before, Will stepped out of the cave and into

627
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,930
the cool night air.

628
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,640
"Now I shall be able to make a difference!

629
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,010
I shall avenge the deaths of my parents, and
my one true love.

630
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,080
I'll be at the Dark Fortress in about seven
days..."

631
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,740
Will's voice echoed, filled with rage:

632
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,410
"Enjoy life while you can, Ddraig!

633
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:06,910
You have only seven days of it left!"

634
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,510
A week had gone by.

635
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:17,890
Will was walking through the forest that surrounded
Galabis, when he saw a young woman tied to

636
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,620
a huge oak tree.

637
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:26,080
Two of Ddraig's men were now advancing upon
her with flaming torches.

638
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,000
One of them burned her arm, but she did not
scream, even though her eyes were filled with

639
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
tears.

640
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,570
"How can men enjoy such cruelty?"

641
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,840
thought Will as he crept silently towards
the torturers.

642
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,550
The other man was about to burn the woman
when Will suddenly attacked him.

643
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,790
He struck the man with his shield, knocking
him unconscious, and killed the other with

644
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,690
his sword.

645
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,810
He placed his weapons on the ground and began
untying the woman.

646
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,260
"Don't worry, it's over.

647
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,510
I'll take you to your home."

648
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,320
The woman punched Will in the face and yelled:

649
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,780
"You fool, you've ruined the endurance test!

650
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,010
I was supposed to be joining Ddraig's army
tomorrow!

651
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,640
How long will I have to wait now?!"

652
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,890
Will didn't know what to say.

653
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,840
Just then, he saw that the man he had knocked
out was now standing again, and was reaching

654
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,910
for his sword.

655
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:32,860
Will went to pick up his magic weapons, but
to his amazement, he found that they had disappeared.

656
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:38,410
The woman stood behind him, holding a large,
heavy branch above his head.

657
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:46,710
She hit Will on the head with it and he fell
to the ground.

658
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,460
Will woke up in a dark, damp dungeon.

659
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,680
He sat up quickly when he noticed a large
rat near his face.

660
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,190
"Good evening."

661
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:03,340
The voice came from a heavily built man with
a horribly scarred face, who sat chained to

662
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,680
the wall opposite Will.

663
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,880
"Which do you want first, the good news or
the bad news?"

664
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,770
"Erm... the bad news."

665
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,910
"Well the bad news is that were going to be
executed tomorrow."

666
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,700
"What's the good news?"

667
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:29,820
"You're awake in time for dinner."

668
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,620
CHAPTER EIGHT
Imprisoned

669
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:38,970
"Here you are, scum."

670
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:44,760
The jailer brought in two bowls of awful smelling
food which he put in front of the prisoners.

671
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,090
"Enjoy it.

672
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,540
It's the last food you'll ever eat."

673
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,490
"Er... you forgot the salt."

674
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,490
The jailer turned to the scarred man angrily.

675
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,260
"Don't try to be funny, Shivan.

676
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,100
In fact, don't talk.

677
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,300
Eat that slop and that is all.

678
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,820
If I hear you talk again, I'll cut your tongue
out."

679
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:09,680
With that, the jailer left the dungeon and
locked the door.

680
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,170
Will and Shivan began talking again, but very
quietly so as not to annoy the jailer.

681
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,010
"Actually, this 'food' would taste better
without the use of a tongue."

682
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,400
Will nodded in agreement.

683
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,730
"So who are you, Shivan?"

684
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,300
"Up until yesterday, I was General Shivan.

685
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,370
I had been General Shivan for more than four
years.

686
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,982
I served Ddraig more loyally than any other
man.

687
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:41,670
And now I've ended up in here - another lamb
for the slaughter."

688
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,369
"Had you made him angry?"

689
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:45,270
"No, I'd done nothing.

690
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:50,010
It seems that Ddraig often decides to sacrifice
his most valuable men.

691
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,390
I only found that out yesterday."

692
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,210
"Why would he do such a thing?"

693
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,690
"Well, for one thing, he thinks that executing
someone so important will make his god even

694
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,100
more pleased with him.

695
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:08,030
And for another, it means that he'll always
be in command of young, athletic generals,

696
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,650
because none of us have the chance to grow
old.

697
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:15,190
But I think that there's another reason.

698
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,190
I think he does it to make sure that no-one
powerful will ever betray him - they'll be

699
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,890
dead before they can even think about doing
so."

700
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,140
"Who is this 'god' you spoke of?"

701
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:32,390
"Scareth The Destroyer - Lord of chaos, of
suffering, and of all black thoughts."

702
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,150
"Do you worship him?"

703
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,960
"I used to."

704
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,380
"When did you stop?"

705
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,380
"Yesterday."

706
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,730
Shivan went on to tell Will all about the
following day's execution of the traitors

707
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:50,180
that was to take place, and although his cell-mate
certainly seemed familiar, never once did

708
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,400
Will recognise him as the man he saw fighting
with his mother all those years ago.

709
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,120
He didn't know that it was this man's knife
that finally cut her throat.

710
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,820
Nor did he realize that the scars were caused
by the hot broth his mother had thrown on

711
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,540
his face.

712
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:15,480
Eventually, the conversation switched to Ddraig
himself and the secret of his power.

713
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,030
This made Will very curious, and Shivan very
excited.

714
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,210
His voice grew louder with each sentence.

715
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,580
"King Ddraig wears a medallion around his
neck.

716
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,730
It was given to him by a sorceress called
Vira.

717
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:36,460
He put it on when he was forty years old,
and he has remained at that age ever since.

718
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,410
That was over a hundred years ago.

719
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:46,790
If the medallion is removed, his strength
will leave him, and he will 'melt' away.

720
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,600
Without that medallion, the mighty Ddraig
is nothing!"

721
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,870
At that moment, the jailer returned.

722
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,410
He looked furious.

723
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,970
"I told you, didn't I?

724
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,300
'No more noise,' I said.

725
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,840
Well let's hear how loud you can be with a
mouthful of blood!"

726
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,740
He walked towards Shivan with a sharp, rusty
knife.

727
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,619
Suddenly, Will threw his food bowl across
the dungeon, hitting the jailer's head.

728
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:20,860
The jailer spun round in pain, and was about
to make a move towards Will when Shivan leapt

729
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,430
to his feet, wrapped his arm around the jailer's
neck and broke it with a terrible snapping

730
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,430
sound.

731
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:32,000
The jailer's lifeless body slid to the floor.

732
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,500
"You wanted peace and quiet?

733
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,230
You've got peace and quiet!"

734
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,380
"Quick, Shivan, throw me his knife!"

735
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,860
The knife flew through the air and landed
at Will's feet.

736
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,300
He picked it up and tried to break his chain
with it.

737
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,240
"What are you doing?"

738
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,550
"Well you know what they say about a chain?"

739
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,510
"No, what do they say?"

740
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,040
"It's only as strong as its weakest link."

741
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,100
Once Will had managed to break his chain,
he freed Shivan.

742
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,900
"We have to get hold of that medallion!"

743
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,100
"Yes, it's time it was worn by someone else!"

744
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,100
"No!

745
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,100
It must be destroyed.

746
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,240
And then, our world will finally be at peace."

747
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,980
Will and Shivan left the dungeon in silence.

748
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,540
They were about to walk down the corridor
when a hand touched Will's shoulder causing

749
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,410
him quite a fright.

750
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,490
He turned round quickly and was both relieved
and surprised to see Kylan.

751
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:35,520
The wizard stood smiling as he held out Will's
magic weapons.

752
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:47,470
"I thought you might need these."

753
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,400
CHAPTER NINE
Out to kill the Tyrant

754
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,109
"Kylan!

755
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:57,790
How did you get into the Dark Fortress?"

756
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,750
"Do you expect me to give away all my secrets?"

757
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,190
"And my weapons!

758
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,360
Where did you find them?"

759
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,230
"In the forest where you left them.

760
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,130
I took them when you were trying to rescue
that strange young woman."

761
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,450
"How could you have taken them?

762
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,680
You weren't even there!"

763
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,950
"Oh I was there.

764
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,880
You simply couldn't see me."

765
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,599
"So if you were there all along, why didn't
you help me?"

766
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:19,599
"I did."

767
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,250
"By letting me get knocked unconscious?"

768
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,460
"You wanted to get into the Dark Fortress,
didn't you?"

769
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,460
"Yes."

770
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,950
"Well, you're here - it really was the simplest
way in.

771
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,520
Now, you must do what you were born to do.

772
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,450
Take your shield, take your sword, and get
rid of that evil tyrant."

773
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,080
Shivan was impressed.

774
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,460
"Are you really Kylan?

775
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,349
I mean... the Kylan?"

776
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:48,030
"I am indeed."

777
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,920
"I never expected to meet you.

778
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,630
I thought you were a myth."

779
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,120
"It's understandable."

780
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,950
"So now we're a team, eh, Will!

781
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,830
Shivan, Goldstone and the most powerful magician
in history!"

782
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,920
"Not quite.

783
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,870
You see, I've already done more than I'm supposed
to."

784
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,050
"Are you leaving, Kylan?"

785
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,359
"Of course.

786
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,100
The rest is up to you, and you alone.

787
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,940
Don't worry, Will, I shall be watching."

788
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,869
"Wait! Kylan!"

789
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,640
Before Will could say anymore, Kylan had disappeared.

790
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,960
Having realized that someone was escaping,
the prisoners in the other cells cried out

791
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,590
to be set free.

792
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,590
"Please...!

793
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,710
Take us with you!"

794
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,080
"We can't - not yet."

795
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,080
"That's right.

796
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,800
If we fail and Ddraig finds out that we've
all been trying to escape, he'll make the

797
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,880
execution as painful as he can."

798
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,190
"Shivan, where will we find him?"

799
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,380
"The throne room.

800
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,360
It's this way, come on!"

801
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:07,900
Ddraig's silver crown reflected the light
of countless black candles.

802
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:14,040
He sat upon his throne, discussing the following
day's 'celebrations' with his new general,

803
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,600
a young man called Tykan...

804
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,740
"How many traitors do I have in the dungeons
below?"

805
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,260
"Including Shivan and the young man caught
in the forest, we have twenty three prisoners."

806
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,460
Ddraig shook his head.

807
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,750
"There must be more, Tykan."

808
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,640
"What do you mean, Your Majesty?"

809
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,320
"I mean there are many more disloyal people
to be punished.

810
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,290
The Day of Scareth is the day traitors are
punished.

811
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,830
The medallion that witch gave me says that
not all traitors have been arrested.

812
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,830
And for that, I want them all caught.

813
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,730
Go forth into Galabis, Tykan.

814
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,849
Bring me as many as you can find."

815
00:50:49,849 --> 00:51:00,400
Tykan nodded and left the throne room, leaving
Ddraig alone to dream of death.

816
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,530
Will and Shivan had heard everything, as they
had been hiding below one of the flights of

817
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,240
steps that led into the throne room.

818
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,890
They both whispered to each other.

819
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,280
"How quiet can you be, Shivan?"

820
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,290
"Like a mouse."

821
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,290
"Good.

822
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,350
We have to catch Ddraig by surprise.

823
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:25,430
Now, can you get across to them steps over
there without being seen?"

824
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,430
"Definitely."

825
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,400
"Then make your way over but remember, be
quiet!"

826
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,980
"What are you going to do?"

827
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:37,970
"I'm going to creep up on him from this side,
and you'll do the same from the other side,

828
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,460
so when we attack, he won't know which of
us to try killing first.

829
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,460
Understand?"

830
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,800
"To the last letter."

831
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,140
"Then go, and be careful."

832
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,000
Shivan moved backwards through a small doorway.

833
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,960
It led into a corridor that was parallel to
three sides of the throne room.

834
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,090
He moved slowly along the corridor and eventually
passed through another small doorway.

835
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:09,520
He was now beneath the other flight of steps,
and was deep in thought:

836
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,840
"This is it.

837
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:18,200
Ddraig will soon be dead, and then I can take
Vira's medallion for myself!

838
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,100
But... but what if we fail?

839
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,160
He'll have me chopped into fish-bait.

840
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,710
Oh well, he was going to kill me anyway.

841
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,190
It's just that we would stand more of a chance
if that wizard hadn't left."

842
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,160
An idea suddenly struck him.

843
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,410
"Although...

844
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,250
I could help save his life!

845
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:44,390
Then I'd be back in his army - back in a position
of power!

846
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,390
Who knows?

847
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,670
He might even execute that Tykan instead of
me!

848
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,770
I wish...

849
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:57,109
I wish I knew what to do."

850
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:04,810
Will stepped silently from his hiding place
and crept towards his target.

851
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:10,930
His movements were like those of a cat, and
just as silent, so he was able to get right

852
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:16,560
next to Ddraig without being seen or heard
for an instant.

853
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,810
He held his magic sword high.

854
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,850
Just then, Shivan decided what he would do.

855
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:30,830
With not much time to think about his options,
he decided that his old life was better than

856
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:32,690
no life at all.

857
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,210
With a single shout, he gave away both his
own and Will's presence:

858
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,310
"Look out, Your Majesty!"

859
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:46,910
Ddraig looked quickly at Shivan, then at Will,
and with a swift, sudden movement, he grabbed

860
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,650
the young adventurer by the throat.

861
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,290
"What are you doing here, Shivan?!

862
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,920
And who is this creature?"

863
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,290
"We shared the same dungeon and escaped together.

864
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,609
It's lucky for you that I'm out of there,
as I soon found out that he planned to kill

865
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:04,609
you!"

866
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:05,780
"As if he'd achieve much.

867
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,600
Is this true, young man?

868
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,230
Are you an assassin?"

869
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,349
Ddraig tightened his grip, making Will choke.

870
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:15,349
"No!

871
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:18,240
No, Your Majesty!

872
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,540
I'm as loyal to you as your new general!"

873
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,600
"But you look like an assassin - you are armed.

874
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,960
Why are you armed?"

875
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,730
At first, Will couldn't think of what to say.

876
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:36,530
He hadn't expected to be having this conversation,
and on top of that, he was finding it harder

877
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,000
to breathe by the second.

878
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,450
Then a suitable lie came to mind.

879
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,750
"King Ddraig.

880
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,650
I made these weapons for you!"

881
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,320
Ddraig released his grip and Will fell to
his knees.

882
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,980
"Speak.

883
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,820
Make it interesting at least."

884
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,440
"Your Majesty...

885
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:03,440
I am a maker of weapons... and I have spent
many months preparing this shield and this

886
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
sword.

887
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,670
I came to offer you these weapons, so that
on the Day of Scareth, you can carry the finest

888
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,650
shield and hold the finest sword!"

889
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,790
Ddraig thought about what Will had said.

890
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:21,119
"Why should I need your weapons?

891
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,619
My own have proved more powerful than any
man's, time and time again."

892
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:26,760
"Yes, but these are special.

893
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,420
They are made of a brand new metal.

894
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:34,140
Believe me when I say that they are indeed
the best.

895
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,500
I will show you if you let me."

896
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,050
"What do you mean?"

897
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:43,150
"Let us test these weapons against your own.

898
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:47,260
If I am wrong, then I will gladly die for
wasting your time."

899
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,109
"Very well.

900
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:52,720
If you are telling the truth, you will die.

901
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,859
If you are lying, you will still die.

902
00:55:55,859 --> 00:56:19,109
As for you, Shivan, if I find that you are
lying, your death will be the slowest of all."

903
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:23,390
CHAPTER TEN
The Confrontation

904
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:30,810
Ddraig's men gathered round as their King
led Will into the fortress' courtyard.

905
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:35,310
They laughed at Shivan when Ddraig made him
kneel with his head on a chopping block.

906
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,400
"You can watch the fight from here, Shivan."

907
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,270
Ddraig passed Will his weapons, then picked
up his own.

908
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:47,339
It was to be a difficult fight, as there wasn't
much light.

909
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:53,520
The night sky was filled with clouds that
hid the moon, and flaming torches created

910
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,110
shadows that could fool the eye.

911
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:58,970
"Scareth will smile tonight.

912
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:05,530
I'm sending Him your soul now, to whet His
appetite for tomorrow's feast."

913
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:09,740
The crowd began chanting as the two swords
clashed.

914
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,180
Swords struck shields again and again, until
Ddraig's shield struck Will in the face, causing

915
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,550
him to drop his weapons and fall.

916
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,520
Will looked up at Ddraig's sword as it came
towards him.

917
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,570
He didn't have time to pick up his weapons,
so he rolled out of the way then jumped to

918
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,570
his feet.

919
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,080
Ddraig was really enjoying himself.

920
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,109
He attacked his unarmed opponent, but Will
avoided death with the help of the martial

921
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:43,070
arts Kylan had taught him - whenever Ddraig
tried stabbing him, he moved out of the way

922
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:45,160
with incredible speed.

923
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,560
Will grabbed a torch and threw it at Ddraig.

924
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,960
He managed to pick up his sword and the fight
continued.

925
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,790
"I think you lied to me, young one.

926
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,050
I think you do intend to kill me!"

927
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,520
"I do and I will!

928
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,310
You've taken everything from me.

929
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:09,090
It's time for you to give something in return
- your life!"

930
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:14,570
Will and Ddraig fought for quite some time,
but Will soon became tired.

931
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:20,119
Once again, Ddraig was able to knock him over,
and he stood over him with his sword pointing

932
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:21,760
upwards into the night sky.

933
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,030
"Your life is at an end, boy!"

934
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:28,680
Will found his shield and hid beneath it.

935
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:38,050
Suddenly, the clouds in the sky drifted apart,
revealing the moon - a crescent moon.

936
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:42,090
Its light shone directly into the crystal
on Will's shield.

937
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:49,690
Abeam of brilliant light shot out of the Sun
Crystal and straight into Ddraig's eyes.

938
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:54,930
The King blinded by the light couldn't see
Will getting to his feet.

939
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:59,849
Will rushed over to Draig and stabbed him
with the Sword of Dayzan.

940
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:06,109
He removed the medallion, threw it to the
ground and crushed it with his foot.

941
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,980
The king howled in agony as the years caught
up with him.

942
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,580
He grew weaker and older, until his head was
just a screaming skull.

943
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:23,530
Finally, all that remained were his clothes,
which were filled with dust.

944
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:29,470
The shocked crowd grew very angry, and they
began to close in on Will.

945
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:35,380
However, they were soon beaten by Ddraig's
prisoners who had been surprised to find themselves

946
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,020
mysteriously freed.

947
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:42,440
Tykan and his men were now locked in the dungeons
instead.

948
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:52,220
Will soon realized that it must have been
the work of Kylan.

949
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:58,440
The next day, the people of Galabis gathered
at the fortress, having heard the news of

950
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,980
Ddraig's death.

951
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:07,440
The people cheered and chanted the name Goldstone,
and Will was presented with Ddraig's crown.

952
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,700
He put the crown under his arm and spoke to
the crowd.

953
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,900
"My friends, we are finally free.

954
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,880
I will be glad to be your King, but I will
not rule you.

955
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,300
You must rule your own lives.

956
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:30,690
Rule them well, and help peace prevail forever.

957
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:36,839
I have lost much, and now want to spend some
time alone.

958
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:43,369
I will soon be leaving to live a simple, quiet
life, but before I go, I shall perform one

959
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:44,869
royal deed.

960
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:54,140
In honor of my one true love, let this world
of ours be given a new name.

961
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,780
From this day forward, it shall be known as
'Delenia.'"

962
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:10,400
Meanwhile, in a far-away cave, an old wizard
smiled the proudest smile of all.

963
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,030
"Why didn't he want to live as a King, Grandfather?"

964
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:23,720
"Because he realized that rulers don't always
choose what is right for the people.

965
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:30,040
His world had suffered for a long time because
of a King.

966
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,660
I think he was afraid of becoming like Ddraig."

967
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,170
"Oh, that would never have happened.

968
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:36,320
He was a good man."

969
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,320
"I agree.

970
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:42,190
But he didn't want to take that chance.

971
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:48,650
So he became King, and then went off to live
in the wilderness."

972
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:52,970
William and Howard heard a car pull up in
the snow outside.

973
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,770
"Oh, your parents are here, William."

974
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,770
"Great!

975
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,609
I can't wait to tell them about everything
that happened!"

976
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:06,590
"Do you mean our walks, the fishing, the snowmen?

977
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,510
Or do you mean what happened in the story?"

978
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,359
"All of it!

979
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,780
It's been a terrific week, Grandfather!"

980
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,380
Howard opened the front door and greeted William's
parents.

981
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,050
"Hello, Adam.

982
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,730
Hello, Liana.

983
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,900
Did you have much trouble getting here?"

984
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,210
"Not really, Howard."

985
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:30,369
"Did you have trouble keeping William away
from the TV, Dad?"

986
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:34,110
"You know... he hardly ever noticed it was
there."

987
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:34,200
- THE END -
