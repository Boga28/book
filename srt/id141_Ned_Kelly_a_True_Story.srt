1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,530
IT IS THE YEAR 1880.
In the prison in Melbourne, Australia, a young

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,530
man has visitors - his mother, a brother,
and two sisters. Nobody is saying very much.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,530
There is only one word to say, and the word
is 'Goodbye'.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,530
Because the young man is Ned Kelly, the most
famous outlaw in all Australia. And tomorrow

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,530
morning the prison officers are going to put
a rope around his neck and hang him until

6
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,530
he is dead.

7
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,530
This is Ned Kelly's story...

8
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,530
CHAPTER ONE
Ned's Young Days

9
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:19,740
JULY, 1865. The story begins in Avenel, a
small town north of Melbourne. Ned Kelly lives

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,100
here with his parents, John and Ellen Kelly.
Ned is ten years old, the oldest boy of the

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:41,680
seven Kelly children. He has two brothers,
Jim and Dan, and four sisters - Anne, Maggie,

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,510
Kate, and Grace.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,510
***

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,270
'Where's your father, boy?' Ellen Kelly called
out to her son one evening. 'Is he on the

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,710
road? Can you see him?'

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:08,740
Ned Kelly looked out of the door. 'No, Ma,'
he said. 'I can't see him.'

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,000
Ned's father came home late, and he came in
quietly.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,659
'Ellen,' he said, 'come with me. I need your
help. There's a dead cow by the trees on the

19
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:27,430
hill. We must cut it up and bring it home.'

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,076
'Oh, John, is it one of our cows?' his wife
asked. 'How did it die?'

21
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:45,439
'It's one of Morgan's cows, and I killed it,'
John said. 'So we must be quick, before he

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,520
comes looking for it.'

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,890
'Oh, you fool!' said Ellen.

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,910
In the children's bed in the next room, Ned
listened to this. It was a small house, with

25
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:10,240
only two rooms, and you could hear everything.
Ned was pleased about the dead cow. They didn't

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,930
often have meat to eat, and the children were
always hungry.

27
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:27,750
But dead cows bring trouble. Three days later
there was a policeman at the door. 'John Kelly,

28
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:36,760
you killed Morgan's cow, and I'm taking you
to prison...'

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:45,430
That was the end of school for Ned Kelly.
He was the man of the family now. He helped

30
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,370
his mother, and he worked on the Kellys' farm.
The farm was not very big, and life was not

31
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,989
easy for the Kellys.

32
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:08,220
John Kelly and Ellen Quinn were from Ireland.
They first met in Melbourne, and then came

33
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:17,769
north, to find land for a farm. Many other
Irish people did the same thing. Everybody

34
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:28,120
wanted land, but some people had a lot more
land than other people. It was a hard, wild

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:36,570
life. There was a lot of drinking, a lot of
fighting, a lot of stealing - horses, cows,

36
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,390
dead or alive...

37
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:49,349
John Kelly was in prison for six months. Prison
was not good for him, and when he came out,

38
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:55,909
he began to drink. A year and a half later
he was dead.

39
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:03,840
'What are we going to do now, Ma?' Ned asked.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:14,480
Ellen thought about it. She was a tall, strong
woman, and all her life she was a fighter.

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,549
She had twelve children in the end and was
ninety-three years old when she died.

42
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:30,140
'We must leave here,' she said. 'We must go
to the northeast, and live near my family.'

43
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
***

44
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:41,430
The Kellys' new house was at Eleven Mile Creek,
near Greta. They had some animals and a small

45
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:50,390
garden, and Ned worked hard to get money for
the family. He could do farming work, take

46
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,930
care of horses and cows, cut down trees.

47
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:04,181
But trouble was never far away. The police
did not like the wild Kelly boys, or their

48
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:15,669
friends. In 1870, when Ned was fifteen, he
hit a man very hard in a fight, and the police

49
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:20,520
put him in prison for six months.

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:29,430
The next year something worse happened. Ned
was in the town of Greta on a brown horse

51
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,270
when Policeman Hall came up to him.

52
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:42,100
'Ned Kelly, you get down and come with me.
You stole that horse and I'm taking you to

53
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,220
prison.'

54
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:51,669
'That's not true,' said Ned, and then there
was a terrible fight. Policeman Hall had a

55
00:05:51,669 --> 00:06:01,080
gun and Ned did not, but Ned was the better
fighter. In the end Hall called for help and

56
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,139
five men came to help him.

57
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:13,620
Next day they took Ned down to Wangaratta
and he went in front of the judge.

58
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:22,130
'It's not my horse, it belongs to a man called
Wild Wright,' Ned told the judge. 'Wright

59
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:29,449
was at my mother's house, and his horse ran
away. He needed a horse so I gave him one

60
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:38,860
of my horses. And he said to me, "When you
find the brown horse, you keep her for me."

61
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,039
And so when I found the horse, I kept her.'

62
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:51,520
'Ned Kelly stole that horse!' Policeman Hall
said. 'It belongs to a man in Mansfield, and

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,990
someone stole it on the 6th of March.'

64
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:02,720
'Well,' Ned said, 'I was in Beechworth prison
up to the 29th of March. How can I steal a

65
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,170
horse when I'm in prison? And Wright told
me it was his horse - I didn't know it was

66
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,960
a stolen horse.'

67
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,300
But it is a crime to have a stolen horse.
Wild Wright, of course, stole the horse, and

68
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:30,410
he went to prison for eighteen months. But
they put Ned Kelly in prison for three years.

69
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:55,990
When he came back to Eleven Mile Creek in
1874, things were very different.

70
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,039
CHAPTER TWO
The Kelly Gang

71
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:13,280
MAY, 1874. Neds sister Annie is dead; his
brother Jim is in prison (five years for stealing

72
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:22,639
cows), and his brother Dan is often in trouble
too. There are new faces at home - a new husband,

73
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
and a new baby, for Neds mother.

74
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,199
***

75
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:38,690
'Ned? Is that you? Oh, Ned!' Ellen Kelly ran
to the door. Ned, now nineteen years old,

76
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,600
tall and strong, was home from prison. He
put his arm round his mother.

77
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
'Hello, Ma,' he said.

78
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,320
'Oh, Ned, it's good to see you,' said Ellen.

79
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,910
'I heard about Jim,' Ned said. 'And little
Annie.'

80
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:06,230
'Poor, poor Annie,' said his mother. 'She
was so ill after she had the baby, and we

81
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,680
couldn't do anything to help her. And poor
Jim got five years!'

82
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:21,200
'Yes, that's hard,' said Ned. 'And what about
you, Ma? I hear you've got a new husband.'

83
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,990
He looked at the sleeping baby in his mother's
arms.

84
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,830
'He's a good man, Ned. Little Ellen here - she's
his daughter.'

85
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,240
Ned touched the baby's little hand.

86
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:45,670
'I'm happy for you, Ma. And I'm happy to be
back.'

87
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,670
***

88
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:53,210
Ned soon found work. He moved from farm to
farm, cutting down trees and helping with

89
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:01,070
the horses and cows. He often came home to
see his mother, and he and George King, Ellen's

90
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:10,590
new husband, were soon friends. George was
from California, and was only five years older

91
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,660
than Ned.

92
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,140
On one visit home, Ned talked to George about
the police. 'Why do they give me all this

93
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,660
trouble?' he said.

94
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,370
'I don't know,' said George. 'They just don't
like you.'

95
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,940
'It's true,' Ned said. 'When somebody loses
a cow or a horse, the police always come to

96
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,950
me with their questions. Then they go to my
mother's house and ask her questions. And

97
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,260
they always go late at night, when you're
all in bed. It isn't right.'

98
00:10:50,260 --> 00:11:00,810
'Well, come and work with me,' said George.
'Why not? You're good with horses, and I don't

99
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,280
have any trouble with the police.'

100
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,620
'What work are you planning to do?' said Ned.

101
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,580
'Sell horses - lots of them.'

102
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:21,450
'And where are you going to get all these
horses from, George?' asked Ned.

103
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,440
George smiled. And Ned laughed.

104
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
***

105
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:37,850
It was exciting work. 'We stole 280 horses,'
Ned said later. 'Then we took them across

106
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:46,330
the Murray River and sold them in New South
Wales for a lot of money.'

107
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,630
The police got angrier and angrier. They couldn't
stop the stealing, and they couldn't catch

108
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:01,200
Ned Kelly or George King with the stolen horses.

109
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:11,490
In August 1877 a new policeman came to Benalla.
Alex Fitzpatrick liked horses, girls, and

110
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:18,770
drink, and for some weeks he and Ned were
friends. Ned's sister Kate was a beautiful

111
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:28,330
girl with long black hair. She liked Fitzpatrick
too, at first. But soon there were angry words

112
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:39,290
between him and Ned, and then a fight. A policeman
could not be a friend of the Kellys for long.

113
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:50,230
April 1878 came. The police had questions
about stolen horses for Dan, and for Ned's

114
00:12:50,230 --> 00:13:00,100
best friend, Joe Byrne. So Fitzpatrick rode
out to the Kellys' house, to find Dan. Perhaps

115
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:09,580
he wanted to see Kate too - but did Kate want
to see him? On his way there he stopped and

116
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:19,990
had two or three drinks. When he arrived at
the house, he felt very strong and brave.

117
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:27,680
'Dan Kelly, you're coming with me to the police
station,' he said.

118
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,540
'I'm having my dinner,' said Dan. 'You can
wait.'

119
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,750
Fitzpatrick sat at the table, waiting for
Dan, but his eyes were on Kate all the time

120
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:55,750
- on her long black hair, on her beautiful
body. The small room felt very hot.

121
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:03,051
Then Kate walked past the table, very near
him, and he put his arm around her.

122
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:09,780
'You're a beautiful girl, Kate,' he said.
'Let's -'

123
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:17,320
'Take your hands off me!' said Kate.

124
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:25,710
Suddenly Ned was at the door, with a gun in
his hand. He fired at Fitzpatrick and hit

125
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,310
him in the wrist.

126
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:38,130
'Get out!' said Ned. 'Get away from my sister!'

127
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:45,360
Fitzpatrick ran out of the house and rode
through the night back to Benalla.

128
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,510
The next morning there were ten policemen
at the door. They found Ellen at home, but

129
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,880
not Ned or Dan.

130
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:05,370
'Ellen Kelly,' they said. 'You and your sons
tried to kill Policeman Fitzpatrick.'

131
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,330
'Nobody tried to kill Fitzpatrick!' said Ellen.
'You just want to make trouble for me and

132
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:20,510
my family.' She had a new baby in her arms,
her third child by George King. But George

133
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,240
did not live with Ellen now.

134
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,870
'Mrs Kelly, where are your sons?' said a policeman.

135
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:39,330
Ellen looked into the policeman's eyes. 'I
don't know,' she said. 'You want them, you

136
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,320
go and find them.'

137
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
***

138
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,360
When Ned and Dan left their mother's house
that night, they rode away into the Wombat

139
00:15:49,360 --> 00:16:00,160
Hills. At Bullock Creek, miles from anywhere,
they built a small hut. They lived wild, and

140
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,730
looked for gold in the river.

141
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:10,610
Joe Byrne, Ned's good friend, went with them,
because he needed to hide from the police

142
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:19,440
too. And in June, three months later, Steve
Hart, another good friend, came out of prison.

143
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:30,230
He, too, got on his horse and rode to Bullock
Creek. So there were four of them.

144
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:40,500
Then, in October, Ellen's brother came to
find them, with some terrible news.

145
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:50,680
'Your mother's going to prison, Ned. For three
years. Because she and you and Dan tried to

146
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:59,010
kill Fitzpatrick, the judge said. And the
police are looking for you and Dan. Be careful,

147
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,380
boys - stay in the hills!'

148
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:12,490
For a second Ned's eyes were red like fire.
He spoke slowly and coldly.

149
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:21,920
'They can look,' he said, 'but they can't
catch me out here.' He looked at his brother

150
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:32,800
Dan and his friends Joe and Steve. 'These
policemen, these judges - they're worse than

151
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:46,730
dogs! They put my mother in prison, and what
did she do? Nothing! From now on, we're the

152
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:57,020
Kelly gang. We're free men - and we're staying
that way. Are you with me, boys?'

153
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:08,290
And that was the beginning of the Kelly Gang.

154
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:19,510
CHAPTER THREE
Three Dead Men

155
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:32,300
OCTOBER, 1878. Four policemen ride north from
the town of Mansfield, Kennedy, McIntyre,

156
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:40,690
Lonigan, and Scanlon are on their way to Stringybark
Creek in the Wombat Hills. They plan to camp

157
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:48,250
there for a week, look for the Kelly Gang
- and bring them back to Mansfield, dead or

158
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,400
alive.

159
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
***

160
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,280
Very early one morning Ned and Dan left Bullock
Creek. Joe and Steve waited at the hut.

161
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:10,080
'Walk quietly, Dan,' said Ned, 'and listen.
I saw horses' tracks near here yesterday,

162
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,210
and I think the police are after us.'

163
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:21,940
The police camp at Stringybark Creek was only
two kilometres away, and the brothers soon

164
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:31,380
found it. They hid behind the trees and watched.
They saw the four policemen, and their guns

165
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,670
- two big heavy guns and four smaller guns.

166
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:46,180
Later, back at Bullock Creek, Joe and Steve
listened to the news about the guns.

167
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:53,340
'We've only got two guns. What can we do?'
said Joe.

168
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:01,790
'They want to kill us,' said Dan. 'They're
going to shoot to kill. Isn't that right,

169
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,790
Ned?'

170
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:11,670
'Yes, that's right,' said Ned. 'So, we can
stay here and wait for them - or we can go

171
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,690
down there and take their guns and horses.
What do you say?'

172
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:28,390
It was an easy answer. The Kelly Gang got
ready, left Bullock Creek, and went quietly

173
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,400
through the trees.

174
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,600
When they arrived at the police camp, only
Lonigan and McIntyre were there. Lonigan sat

175
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:49,660
on a tree, reading a newspaper, and McIntyre
watched the camp fire. Then, from behind a

176
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,360
tree, Ned Kelly called out.

177
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,570
'Put your hands up!'

178
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:07,940
McIntyre had no gun, so he sat still and put
his hands up, but Lonigan ran. Then he got

179
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:15,030
down behind a fallen tree, took out his gun,
and put his head up.

180
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:27,020
He was a fool. A bullet from Ned's gun hit
him in the head, and he died at once.

181
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:35,740
Ned ran to McIntyre. 'Don't move!' he said.
'We don't want to kill you, we just want the

182
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,410
guns and horses.'

183
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,370
But before the gang could find the guns and
leave, they heard a noise in the trees.

184
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:52,690
'Ned!' called Steve. 'The other two policemen
are coming back!'

185
00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:04,060
'Sit on this tree,' Ned said to McIntyre.
'And when you see your friends, call out to

186
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:14,530
them. Say, "Don't shoot - put your guns on
the ground." We don't want to kill them, or

187
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,530
you.'

188
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:23,600
Seconds later, Kennedy and Scanlon rode into
the camp. McIntyre stood up and said, 'Get

189
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,010
off your horses and put your hands up - there
are men with guns here.'

190
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:40,000
'Oh yes?' said Kennedy. He laughed at McIntyre.
'What men? What guns?'

191
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,210
At once the Kelly Gang came out of the trees
and Ned called, 'Put your hands up!'

192
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:57,750
Everything happened very quickly. A bullet
from Ned's gun hit Scanlon, and he fell from

193
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:08,360
his horse. Kennedy jumped off his horse and
fired at Dan. Dan fired back, and Kennedy

194
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,830
ran back into the trees.

195
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:18,980
McIntyre could not shoot because he did not
have his gun with him. But there in front

196
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,880
of him was Kennedy's horse. He jumped on it
and rode into the trees.

197
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:34,470
Kennedy tried to get away too. He went quietly
through the trees, but suddenly he saw Ned

198
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:44,760
in front of him. The two men fired - and Kennedy
fell down. Soon he was dead.

199
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:56,150
'He was a brave man, but it was him or me,'
said Ned. 'I didn't want to do it. I didn't

200
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,200
want to kill any of them.'

201
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,750
The gang put coats over the three dead bodies,
took the horses, guns and food, and rode away.

202
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:21,150
'They came to kill us, boys,' said Ned, 'but
we killed them. What could we do? Now we must

203
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,080
go - and we're not coming back.'

204
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,780
The Kelly Gang rode away to the north.

205
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
***

206
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:42,390
The next day, tired and dirty, McIntyre arrived
back in Mansfield. Soon every town and village

207
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,780
and farm in the north-east knew about the
killing of the three policemen at Stringybark

208
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,210
Creek.

209
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:57,850
'The Kelly Gang are killers,' said the police.
'These men are now outlaws, and we must catch

210
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:07,210
them, dead or alive. When you see them, tell
us. We are giving 500 pounds reward for news

211
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:15,059
of every man in the gang - 2000 pounds for
all four of them.'

212
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:25,190
It was a lot of money. More policemen came
to the north-east, with more guns, more horses.

213
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,870
Ned and the gang stayed in the north-east.
They tried to get away to the north, but there

214
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:38,150
was a lot of water in the Murray River, and
they couldn't get across it. They got help

215
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:46,070
from their friends and moved from place to
place all the time. One week they rode more

216
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,380
than three hundred kilometres.

217
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:57,720
Thirty policemen rode through the hills for
a month and looked for the outlaws night and

218
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:08,700
day. But they never found them, and in December
Ned and the gang moved on to the Warby Hills.

219
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:34,390
It was a hard, wild life, and the outlaws
were tired, hungry, and angry men.

220
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,361
CHAPTER FOUR
Two Visits to the Bank

221
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:50,980
DECEMBER, 1878. The Kelly Gang have many friends,
but they have no money. So they rob the bank

222
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:57,780
in the little town of Euroa. They speak nicely
to the people in the town, and do not fire

223
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:07,600
their guns. They leave Euroa with 2260 pounds.
But they give a lot of the money to their

224
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:15,820
friends, the poor farmers of the north-east,
to buy food, clothes, and land. The police

225
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,370
reward goes up to 2500 pounds.

226
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,370
***

227
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,560
The police tried hard to catch the Kelly Gang,
but the outlaws had help from their friends.

228
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:36,990
They were always miles away when the police
came to look for them. So the police put many

229
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,700
of their friends in prison.

230
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:50,570
Ned was very angry about this. 'It isn't right!'
he said. 'Why do the police do this? Because

231
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:58,480
our friends are poor farmers, not rich ones,
and because they help us. We must stop the

232
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,700
police!'

233
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,320
'But how?' said Steve. 'What can we do?'

234
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:16,929
'Two things,' said Ned. 'First, we need more
money, so we must visit a bank. And second,

235
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:23,150
we tell everybody in Australia about the police
here in Victoria.'

236
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:29,670
'Rob another bank?' Dan said. 'But the police
are watching all the banks now.'

237
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:37,059
'Yes, in Victoria,' said Ned. 'But not in
New South Wales, so we're going to a bank

238
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:45,429
in Jerilderie. Here's the plan. There are
only two policemen in Jerilderie. We arrive

239
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:52,220
at night, go to the police station, and lock
the policemen in the station. Then we rob

240
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,400
the bank, and go to the office of Jerilderie's
newspaper.'

241
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,210
'The newspaper office?' said Dan. 'Why? What
for?'

242
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:14,330
'To print this,' said Joe. 'Look. It's Ned's
letter to the world. I wrote it down for him.

243
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:20,340
It tells the true story about Ned and his
family, about the police, about Stringybark

244
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,260
Creek, about everything.'

245
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:30,950
'We want everybody to read this letter, but
how do we give it to them?' Ned said. 'We

246
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,179
must print it in a newspaper. It's the only
way.'

247
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,179
***

248
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:44,630
Ned planned the Jerilderie visit very carefully.
There were now more than two hundred policemen

249
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:51,900
in the north-east of Victoria because of the
Kelly Gang, and Ned asked his friend Aaron

250
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,650
Sherritt for help.

251
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:04,390
So Aaron went drinking with a policeman. Money
passed from one hand to another, and Aaron

252
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,550
spoke quietly in the policeman's ear.

253
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:18,440
'Go to Corryong. The gang are planning to
cross the Murray River near there very soon.'

254
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,530
So the police rode east to Corryong - and
the Kelly Gang rode west, and crossed the

255
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:35,420
river two hundred kilometres away. And late
on a Saturday night in February 1879, they

256
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,820
rode into the town of Jerilderie.

257
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:48,930
Outside the police station Ned began to shout,
'Help! Help! There's a big fight at the hotel!

258
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,630
We need help!'

259
00:30:52,630 --> 00:31:00,799
The two policemen ran out - and saw the outlaws
with their guns. The gang locked the policemen

260
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,850
in a room in the station, and took their uniforms.

261
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:15,059
For the next two days the gang lived in the
police station. On Sunday Joe and Steve put

262
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:23,490
on the police uniforms and walked around the
town. 'We're the new policemen for Jerilderie,'

263
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:31,309
they told everyone. They went past the bank
and the hotel next to it, and looked carefully

264
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,590
at all the doors, front and back.

265
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:43,850
Then, on Monday morning Dan and Steve went
into the hotel next to the bank, and took

266
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,880
out their guns. They took all the hotel workers
into one room.

267
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:00,730
'Don't move,' said Dan. 'You're our hostages,
but don't be afraid. We don't want to shoot

268
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,470
anybody.'

269
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:10,420
Ned and Joe went into the bank through the
back door. When they came back to the hotel,

270
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:18,640
they had more hostages - two bank workers
and all the people from the bank. And Ned

271
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,600
had the bank's money - 2140 pounds.

272
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,340
There were now about sixty hostages in the
room, and Ned began to speak to them.

273
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:46,410
'What's happening in this country? Do you
know? No, you don't! So listen! Poor men get

274
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:56,270
poorer, and rich men get richer. The police
help the rich farmers, and put the poor farmers

275
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:10,320
in prison. Why? For nothing! Do you call this
justice? There is no justice in Australia!

276
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:21,280
'The police say we are killers. But I say
the police are killers! I'm going to tell

277
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:32,610
you about Stringybark Creek - the true story,
not the police story.'

278
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:41,460
Ned began to read to the hostages from his
letter. It was a long letter, 56 pages and

279
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:50,440
more than 75,000 words. After a few pages
he stopped.

280
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:58,630
'Where's the newspaper office in this town?'
he said. 'I want to print this letter. Then

281
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,480
everybody can read it.'

282
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,340
Edwin Living, one of the bank workers, answered.

283
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:17,659
'Mr Gill is the editor of the newspaper,'
he said. 'I know his house. I can take you

284
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,659
there.'

285
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,590
'Come on, then,' Ned said.

286
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:30,310
But Mr Gill was not at home. He was at a farm
ten kilometres away. When he heard the Kelly

287
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:37,270
Gang were in town, he ran away, because he
was afraid of them.

288
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,280
At the house Mrs Gill opened the door.

289
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,619
'Where's your husband?' Ned asked.

290
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:54,190
'I - I don't know. He's - he's away,' Mrs
Gill said.

291
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:02,109
Ned looked at her angrily, and took out his
letter. 'I want him to print this in his newspaper,'

292
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:03,240
he said.

293
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,740
'Give it to me,' said Edwin Living. 'I can
give it to Mr Gill when he gets back.'

294
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:20,240
'He must print it,' said Ned. 'It's about
my life, and I want the world to read it.'

295
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:29,310
'Yes,' said Edwin. 'Everybody must read it.
And Mr Gill's going to print it - for sure,

296
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,020
Mr Kelly.'

297
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:42,300
'He must,' Ned said. 'All right, you give
it to him. But do it! Or the next time I come

298
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,500
to Jerilderie...'

299
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:54,500
They went back to the hotel, and Ned had a
drink with the hostages. Then the four outlaws

300
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:01,690
rode out of town, back to the Murray River,
and across into Victoria and the hills in

301
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,780
the north-east.

302
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
***

303
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,340
The police looked everywhere. They made the
reward 8,000 pounds, but nobody came to get

304
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:21,831
it. Nobody wanted to help them. In Jerilderie,
people laughed about the visit of the Kelly

305
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:30,520
Gang. In April, Ned's friends came out of
prison and went back to their farms. And for

306
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:37,660
sixteen months, the police heard nothing of
the Kelly Gang.

307
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:44,080
And Ned's letter - the famous 'Jerilderie
Letter'?

308
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:53,090
Edwin Living did not give it to Mr Gill. He
went down to Melbourne and gave it to the

309
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,510
police.

310
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:16,410
Nobody saw the letter again for fifty years.

311
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,010
CHAPTER FIVE
Alive or Dead at Glenrowan

312
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:30,970
JUNE, 1880. The Kelly Gang are living in the
hills. Their friends bring them food, but

313
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:38,010
life is hard, and the police are still making
trouble. They don't put the Kellys' friends

314
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:47,700
in prison now, but they stop them buying land.
And why? Because they are friends of the Kelly

315
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,060
Gang...

316
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
***

317
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:58,790
'We must do something,' Ned said, 'to help
our friends. We need a new country - a country

318
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:06,730
for poor people, with good police, and good
judges. But it's not going to happen easily.

319
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,870
We must fight for it!'

320
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:16,580
'We need money for that,' said Joe. 'A lot
of money. And there's a policeman with a gun

321
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,030
at every bank now.'

322
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:27,050
'We need armour, to go over our heads and
bodies,' Ned said. 'Bullets can't get through

323
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,050
armour.'

324
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:33,070
'How are we going to get armour?' asked Dan.

325
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,750
'We can make it,' said Ned.

326
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:45,460
And they did. With help from their friends,
they made four suits of armour from old farm

327
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,680
machinery. Then they began to plan their fight.

328
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,190
'Our friends want to help,' Ned said. 'They
have guns, and they want to fight with us.

329
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:04,240
So we need to bring a lot of policemen to
one place. How can we do that?'

330
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,480
'With a killing,' said Joe. 'We kill Aaron
Sherritt. He's working for the police - he

331
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:21,680
tells them everything about us! You know it,
I know it, everybody knows it. He was a friend

332
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,360
once, but now he wants to see us dead!'

333
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:34,290
'Yes, that's true,' Ned said. 'We hear it
from everybody. So, you go to Aaron's house

334
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:39,980
at Beechworth and shoot him. You and Dan.'

335
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:47,830
'Right,' said Dan. 'And then when the Beechworth
police hear about the killing, they know it's

336
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:55,210
us, the Kelly Gang. So they ask for help from
the police at Benalla...'

337
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:59,780
'And the Benalla police take the train to
Beechworth,' said Steve. 'Lots of police,

338
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,450
all in one train.'

339
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:14,180
'And we', Ned said quietly, 'are waiting for
the train at Glenrowan...'

340
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:22,820
The plan began well. Joe and Dan rode to Beechworth.
When Aaron Sherritt opened his door on Saturday

341
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:33,460
26th June, Joe shot him at once. Then the
two outlaws rode sixty kilometres across country

342
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:41,550
to Glenrowan. News of the killing went down
to Benalla.

343
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:49,270
Ned and Steve arrived at Glenrowan Inn on
Saturday afternoon. They began to bring hostages

344
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:56,869
into the inn - people from the railway station,
railway workers, people from the town. Then

345
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:02,820
Ned took some of the railway workers to the
hill just past the railway station.

346
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,530
'Take up the railway line,' he told them.
'Go on!'

347
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:16,320
'We can't do that!' one worker said. 'Do you
want to kill everybody on the next train?'

348
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:27,470
Then he saw Ned's gun, and asked no more questions.
The workers took up three metres of railway

349
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:36,060
line, and went back to the inn with Ned. Joe
and Dan were there now, and some of the gang's

350
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:45,650
friends. Other friends, about thirty men,
stayed near the railway line. In the inn there

351
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,520
was a lot of drinking that night.

352
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:57,960
On Sunday morning Ned found more hostages
- the schoolteacher, Thomas Curnow, with his

353
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:07,090
young wife, baby, and sister. There were now
sixty-two hostages in the inn. And everybody

354
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:13,100
waited for the police train.

355
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:22,110
The police moved very slowly. In Beechworth,
Benalla, and Melbourne they talked, made plans,

356
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:30,400
and talked some more. In the end, a police
train left Melbourne late on Sunday evening.

357
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:39,150
And that evening Ned told about twenty of
the hostages, 'You can go home.' Later, the

358
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,170
schoolteacher came to him.

359
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:49,240
'Can I take my family home?' he asked. 'Don't
be afraid of me - you know I'm a friend of

360
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,500
the Kellys.'

361
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,830
'Yes, you can go,' said Ned.

362
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:05,220
Thomas Curnow was a brave man. He took his
young family home, and later went quietly

363
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,920
out into the night and along the railway line.
At three o'clock in the morning he heard the

364
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,650
train, and held up a red light.

365
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,730
'Stop! Stop!' he cried.

366
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,730
***

367
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:31,230
At the inn, Ned and the gang heard the train
too. They listened, but there was no noise

368
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:38,580
of a crash, no train falling through the trees,
no cries and shouts.

369
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,710
'What's happening?' Steve said.

370
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:51,350
'Nothing,' said Ned. 'Somebody stopped the
train before it got to the broken rails. Put

371
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,630
your armour on, boys, and get ready to fight.'

372
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:03,530
The gang went out to the front of the inn.
They began to fire at the police, and the

373
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,970
police fired back. Bullets went everywhere.

374
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:18,290
Three of the hostages inside the inn died.
The police shot Ned in the arm and the foot,

375
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,550
and Joe in the leg.

376
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:30,150
'Go back into the inn,' Ned said to the gang.
'I must find our friends. They must get away

377
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,480
from here.'

378
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,980
The gang's friends were near the railway line.

379
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:43,240
'We want to fight, Ned,' they said. 'Take
us with you!'

380
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,370
'No, no, you must get away,' said Ned. 'The
plan for the train went wrong, and there are

381
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:57,510
police everywhere. This is our fight. You
can't help us! Go!'

382
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:08,290
Back at the inn, the shooting did not stop.
The hostages, many of them women and children,

383
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:16,349
were on the floor, their faces white and afraid.
Joe was in the front room with a drink in

384
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:17,980
his hand.

385
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:30,540
'I drink to the Kelly Gang!' he cried. Then
a bullet came through the wall and hit him.

386
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,670
He died at once.

387
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:42,890
The wounds in Ned's arm and foot were bad,
and in the trees he fell to the ground. A

388
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:52,840
friend tried to help him, but for some hours
Ned could not move. Then, slowly, he stood

389
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:03,740
up, and in his armour began to walk back to
the inn. His brother Dan and Steve Hart were

390
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:09,560
still inside the inn, and Ned went back to
help them.

391
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:20,271
In the early morning light, he came slowly
out of the trees, his gun in his hand. One

392
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:31,310
man against thirty-four policemen. They fired
and fired at him, but the bullets hit Ned's

393
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,560
armour, and Ned laughed.

394
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,369
'Go on - fire! You can't kill me!' he called.

395
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:51,109
But there was no armour on Ned's legs. One
of the policemen saw this, and fired - once,

396
00:46:51,109 --> 00:47:00,390
twice... The bullets hit Ned's legs, and he
fell slowly to the ground.

397
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:10,109
At once the police were all around him. He
was alive, but only just, and they carried

398
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:13,040
him to the railway station.

399
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:23,280
Soon after this, the last hostages left Glenrowan
Inn.

400
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:31,400
Only Dan and Steve were still inside, but
the police did not stop firing at the building.

401
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,869
Later on that Monday morning a second train
arrived in Glenrowan, with more police, photographers,

402
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:47,270
and newspaper men. There were now more than
a thousand people in the town. And down south,

403
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:56,040
in Melbourne, hundreds of people waited in
the streets for news of the Kelly Gang.

404
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:03,780
On Monday afternoon Ned's sisters, Maggie
and Kate, arrived in Glenrowan. They heard

405
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:09,310
the news about Ned, and then asked for news
of Dan.

406
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:14,940
'Maggie, tell your brother and Steve Hart
to put down their guns and come out of the

407
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,750
inn,' said a policeman.

408
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:25,490
'Tell them to stop fighting? Never!' said
Maggie.

409
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:33,690
Maggie and Kate did not see Dan alive again.
The police were afraid to go into the inn,

410
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:39,859
but they did not want Dan and Steve to get
away in the night. So they set fire to the

411
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:40,859
building.

412
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:49,290
Old buildings burn fast, and when Maggie and
Kate got to the inn, the sky was red with

413
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,510
fire.

414
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:56,340
'Dan! Oh, Dan!' Maggie called out, again and
again.

415
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:03,900
'My poor, poor brother!' Kate cried.

416
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,900
***

417
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:12,820
Glenrowan Inn burnt down to the ground. When
the fire was cold, they took out the dead

418
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:25,810
bodies of Dan Kelly, Steve Hart, and Joe Byrne.
Ned was alive, but in prison. It was the end

419
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:47,310
of the Kelly Gang.

420
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,750
CHAPTER SIX
Ned's Last Days

421
00:49:49,750 --> 00:50:02,310
JULY, 1880. The police take Ned Kelly to Benalla,
then to Melbourne prison. There is a lot of

422
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:10,770
waiting, and talking, and more talking. The
police talk, the judges talk, Ned talks - but

423
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:16,770
the ending is always the same.

424
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,770
***

425
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:23,160
At the end of October Ned went before his
last judge, Sir Redmond Barry, in Melbourne.

426
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,670
For two days Judge Barry listened to the police,
listened to Ned, read the police papers, and

427
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:37,400
thought about it. But he didn't think long.
There were a lot of dead policemen in Ned

428
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,040
Kelly's life, and there was only one answer
to that.

429
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:52,200
Ned Kelly must die. Hang him in the prison.
Hang him by the neck until he is dead. A lesson

430
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:58,260
to every outlaw in Australia.

431
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
***

432
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:05,610
Ned's mother Ellen was still in Melbourne
prison. When they told her the news, she cried

433
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:13,450
- she cried for her dead son Dan, and she
cried for her son Ned, alive, but waiting

434
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:23,730
to die. They took her to see Ned on his last
day alive. What did mother and son talk about

435
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,300
that day?

436
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,100
Ned's sisters and brother worked hard to help
him.

437
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:40,349
'How can they do this?' said Maggie angrily.
'How can they hang poor Ned? What did the

438
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:45,840
police do to him? Why don't the judges think
about that?'

439
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:53,330
'Shh, Maggie,' said Jim. 'No time for that
now. We must get out there and talk to the

440
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,580
people in the town.'

441
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:02,490
And so they did. They went all round Melbourne,
to all the hotels, talking to everybody.

442
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:09,619
'They're going to hang Ned Kelly. What do
you think about that?' they asked.

443
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:12,780
'It's not right,' said one man.

444
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:21,260
'Why do they want to hang him?' a second man
said. 'Because he killed a policeman? No.

445
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,490
Because he helps poor people and gives them
money, that's why.'

446
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:31,490
'But what can we do?' asked a third man.

447
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:36,839
'Put your names on our petition,' was the
answer.

448
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:46,860
There were more than 32,000 names on the Kelly
petition, but the petition changed nothing.

449
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:55,710
So the last visitors came to see Ned on the
10th of November, and he ate his last dinner.

450
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:03,099
Then he sang for half an hour, and went to
bed.

451
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:11,320
Next morning they took Ned across the prison
to a room with a rope.

452
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:19,880
Outside the prison more than 5000 people waited
- men and women, rich and poor.

453
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,609
'Where's the Kelly family?' one woman asked.

454
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:31,230
'Some of them are here, at the hotel,' was
the answer. 'But Maggie went back to Beechworth

455
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:38,290
yesterday. She wanted to be with her children.
And there's Ned's poor mother - she's in the

456
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,119
prison too, waiting for ten o'clock.'

457
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:49,710
Then the prisoners in Melbourne prison began
to make a terrible noise, shouting and crying

458
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:59,800
out and banging on their doors. And in her
room Ellen Kelly cried quietly for her oldest

459
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,430
son.

460
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:09,240
In the hotel Jim Kelly sat with his head in
his hands.

461
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:19,119
'Poor Ned, this is the end of all his troubles,'
he said.

462
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:29,250
And at ten o'clock, the prison officers put
the rope around Ned Kelly's neck and hanged

463
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,810
him.

464
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:31,810
***

465
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:40,630
Ned was dead - but in the north-east, life
went on. Sixty-eight people got money from

466
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:48,760
the Kelly Gang reward. Schoolteacher Thomas
Curnow got 1000 pounds.

467
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:56,810
A new man, Policeman Graham, came to Greta.
He was a good policeman, and Ned's friends

468
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:04,960
listened to him. 'Don't make trouble, and
then you can buy your farms,' he told them.

469
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:13,060
He went to Eleven Mile Creek and had tea with
Ellen Kelly. Everyone talked about that.

470
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:21,970
Slowly things began to change. The police
tried to be more friendly, to help poor people,

471
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:29,880
and not just the rich. Most of the young men
stopped stealing and fighting the police.

472
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,160
Soon it was quiet in the north-east.

473
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:41,910
The other Kelly children stayed out of trouble.
Jim Kelly was a good son to his mother all

474
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:51,130
her life. Ellen lived to the age of ninety-three,
and had many grandchildren. But she never

475
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:55,180
forgot her oldest son Ned.

476
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,180
***

477
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:04,849
Who was the real Ned Kelly? Did he fight for
the poor, or just for Ned Kelly? Some people

478
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:13,950
say he was a brave man. Some people say he
was a fool. Some people say he was just a

479
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:19,089
killer, just a wild man with a gun.

480
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:27,740
One thing is sure. More than a hundred years
later people are still talking about him.

481
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:36,250
There are books about him, and songs and films
and websites. Everybody still remembers Australia's

482
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,579
most famous outlaw.

483
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:38,869
- THE END -
