CHAPTER ONE
The Fisherman and the Giant

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:11,280
Once there was a poor fisherman. He never caught 
many fish and so he had no money. On some days he  

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,560
did not catch any fish. He couldn't buy food for 
his wife and three children. They only ate fish!

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,120
Usually he caught very small fish, 
but one day he caught a dead horse.  

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,000
'Today is a bad day,' he thought.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,920
Angrily, he began to fish again. This 
time he caught a bag of old cups.  

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
Sadly, he threw them back in the water.  

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:55,360
'What can I do?' he said. 'I am a poor man. I want 
to sell fish. I want to buy food for my children.'

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
He tried again. This time he caught an old jar.  

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,840
It looked green, but then he looked 
again. It was dirty. So he washed it  

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,720
and it was gold. There were some words on 
the top of the jar, but he couldn't read.

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,200
The fisherman jumped up happily. 
'I can sell this now,' he said.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
'Today is a good day.'

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,960
He looked at the jar carefully. 'Perhaps 
there is something inside,' he thought.  

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,280
'I'll open it.' So he opened the jar 
and looked inside. Suddenly white smoke  

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,760
came out of the jar and a great giant appeared. 
The fisherman was very afraid. The giant spoke.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
'Now, fisherman. I am going to kill you.'

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,600
'Why?' cried the fisherman. 'What did I do?'

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,840
'You opened the jar. For that I am going 
to kill you. How do you want to die?  

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,360
I can kill you with my hands, or 
I can throw you into the sea.'

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
'But why do you have to kill me?'

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,560
'I will tell you,' said the giant. 'One day, 
the King of the Giants was very angry with me.  

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,920
I took his youngest and loveliest daughter 
for a walk by the sea and he didn't like it.  

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,160
So he put me in this jar. I could not get out 
because he wrote his name on the top of the jar.  

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,880
I could hear him from inside the jar. 
"Because you love the sea, you dog," he cried,  

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,880
"you can live in it!" And 
he threw me in the water.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,400
'I was in the jar for days and weeks. "One day 
somebody will open this bottle," I thought.  

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
"And I will make them into a great king or queen."  

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,480
But after a hundred years, nobody 
opened the bottle. So I thought,  

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:27,440
"I will make them into a king or queen but not a 
great king or queen." After 200 years, I thought,  

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,240
"Where is this person? Now I will make them 
rich, but I will not make them a king or queen."  

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,000
After 300 years, I was very angry." When 
somebody opens the jar, I will kill them,"  

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,400
I thought. You are that person, 
Fisherman. How do you want to die?'

34
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,880
'I have one question,' said the 
fisherman. 'Will you answer it?'

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
'I will,' said the giant, 'but ask quickly.'

36
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
'Were you in that jar?'

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,520
'Yes, I was,' answered the giant. 'You saw me.'

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
'But you are so big. Your 
hand is as big as the jar.  

39
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,760
Think before you speak. Is 
there nothing inside your head?'

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,840
The giant was not very clever. 'I 
will show you,' he said angrily.  

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,440
Suddenly he disappeared into white smoke 
again, and the smoke went inside the jar.  

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,880
'You see!' he called from inside. The 
fisherman quickly put the top back on the jar.

43
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,520
'Hah! Now, Giant,' he said. 'I will 
throw the jar back into the sea.  

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
Perhaps somebody will find 
you in another 300 years.'

45
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,280
'Please open the jar,' called the 
Giant. 'I will make you a rich man.'

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
'No. You will kill me,' answered the fisherman.

47
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,520
'No, I won't,' said the giant. 'I 
won't. I'll make you very, very rich.'

48
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,440
The fisherman thought for a minute. 'All right, 
then,' he said, and opened the jar. White smoke  

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,520
came out of the jar and the giant appeared 
again. He quickly threw the jar into the sea.

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,840
'Thank you,' he said to the fisherman. 
'I will not forget this. Come with me.'  

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,840
The fisherman followed the giant round the 
city walls and over a mountain. There they  

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,840
came to a great blue and gold sea. 
In the water there were many fish.

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,040
'Now, catch something. I will watch 
you,' said the giant. In no time,  

54
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
the fisherman caught three fish - three 
beautiful red, white and gold fish.  

55
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,440
'Take these fish to your king,' said the giant. 
'He will give you a lot of money for them.'

56
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,080
The giant disappeared, and blue and 
gold smoke went into the ground.

57
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,840
When the king saw the fish, 
he said to the fisherman,  

58
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,840
'Those are beautiful fish! I 
will give you gold for them.'  

59
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,680
Then he said to his servant, 'Take these 
fish to the cook. We will eat them today.'

60
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,480
The fisherman took his gold home to his 
family. They ate a wonderful dinner of bread,  

61
00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:00,000
meat, fruit, vegetables and no fish. For the 
first time in their lives, they were not hungry.

62
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:10,480
The king's cook put the fish over the fire. 
They started to cook. Suddenly, the smoke from  

63
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,000
the fire went blue and gold and a strange woman 
appeared in the kitchen. She spoke to the fish.

64
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:28,960
'Fish, fish! Are you doing your work?' The 
fish did not answer. Then their heads went up,  

65
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:37,760
and they said, 'We are, and we are happy.' The 
strange woman pushed the fish into the fire.  

66
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,240
The smoke from the fire went blue and 
gold and the woman disappeared into it.

67
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,520
The king and his servant came into the kitchen. 
'I am waiting for the fish. Where are they?'  

68
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,320
he said to the cook. He saw that the fish were in 
the fire and he could not eat them. The cook told  

69
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,400
him about the strange woman. The king wanted 
to see the woman so he sent for the fisherman.  

70
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,640
'Bring me three more fish!' he said.

71
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,600
When the fisherman came back with three more fish,  

72
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,600
the king gave him more gold. The 
cook put the fish over the fire.  

73
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,280
This time the smoke from the fire went red 
and gold and a big man with red hair appeared.

74
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,920
'Fish, fish! Are you doing your work?'  

75
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,320
The fish answered, 'We are, we are! And we 
are happy!' And the same thing happened.  

76
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,680
The man pushed the fish into the fire and 
disappeared into the red and gold smoke.

77
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,320
The king did not speak for a minute. This 
was magic! Then he turned to the fisherman.  

78
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,720
'Where do you get these fish?' he asked.

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
'I get them from a sea of blue 
and gold water over the mountain.'

80
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,680
'Do you know this sea?' 
the king asked his servant.

81
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,720
'No. I often go across the mountain, 
but there is no blue and gold sea.'

82
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,000
'Will you take us there?' 
the king asked the fisherman.

83
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,480
The king and his men followed 
the fisherman over the mountain  

84
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,480
to the sea of blue and gold and there they saw the 
wonderful fish. The fish were jewels in the water.

85
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,400
'Wait here,' said the king. He took 
two men and went round the sea.  

86
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,360
There they came to a great house of red stone. All 
round the house were gardens of wonderful flowers.  

87
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,080
There was no answer at the door. But it 
was open so the king went in. He saw many  

88
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:15,440
beautiful rooms but no people. He came 
into a very large room with high windows.  

89
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Somebody spoke: 'When will I 
die? I don't want to live.'

90
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
The king saw a young man  

91
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,880
at the other end of the room. He was 
on the floor with a coat over his feet.

92
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
'I know you are a king,' said the 
young man, 'but I cannot stand up.'  

93
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,920
The king took away the coat and saw 
that his feet were fine white stone.

94
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:59,840
'What is this?' cried the king. 'Why do you 
have stone feet? Why do the fish talk? Why  

95
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:07,840
does a man with red hair appear from nowhere 
in my kitchen? What is happening? Tell me.'

96
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,200
'I will tell you,' said the young 
man. 'Please sit down and listen.  

97
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,280
There was once a great city in this 
place. My father was king of that city,  

98
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,560
and I was a prince. Then my father died and 
I was the king. I married a beautiful woman.  

99
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,880
She was my queen but she did not love me. She 
loved a servant. When I learnt about him, I wanted  

100
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,520
to kill that servant. We had a fight. I hurt him 
but I didn't kill him. He could not use his legs.

101
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:00,400
'My wife was very angry. She can do magic 
and she changed my feet to white stone.  

102
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:12,000
Then I could not use my legs. That was not the 
end of it. Three mountains and a blue and gold sea  

103
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,240
appeared in place of the city. She changed 
the men and women of the city into fish.

104
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,840
'There is a little house of white 
stone in the garden of this house.  

105
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,720
The servant lives there. He cannot 
walk. My wife visits him every day.'

106
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,480
The king went into the garden and thought for some 
time. Then he went to the house of white stone.  

107
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:49,760
He found the servant inside and killed him. He 
put the servant under the bed and then climbed  

108
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:58,000
onto it. He pulled the servant's jacket over 
his face. Sometime later, the queen came in.

109
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,520
'Are you happy, my dearest servant?' she asked.

110
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,880
'No,' said the king. 'I cannot sleep.  

111
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,680
Somebody is crying. The young king 
is crying because of his stone feet.'

112
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,880
The queen went to the young king and threw some 
magic water over his feet. He stood up and walked.

113
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,080
Then she came back to the house of white 
stone. 'And I cannot sleep,' the king said,  

114
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,080
'because the men and women of the city cry 
at night. They do not want to be fish.'

115
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:49,520
So the queen went to the blue and gold sea. She 
said some magic words. A great city appeared all  

116
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,440
round her. Men and women ran happily through 
the streets and in and out of the houses.  

117
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
Then the queen came back to 
the house of white stone.

118
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,880
'Are you happy now, my dear servant?' she asked.

119
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,720
'Yes, my love,' he said. 'Come near 
me.' She came near him. 'Come nearer.  

120
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,960
I want to put my arms round you.' She came 
nearer his bed. He put his arms round her.  

121
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
In one hand he had a knife, and he killed her.

122
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,960
He went back to the young king. 'Your queen 
is dead. The city and its people are living.'

123
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,080
The older king and the young 
king were friends after that.  

124
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,840
One city helped the other city. 
But nobody ate fish again.

125
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,920
The fisherman and his family were happy. The 
two kings sent them gold and beautiful things.  

126
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,960
They were never hungry again.
 
 
 
 

127
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,526
- THE END -
