00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,250
CHAPTER ONE
August 1940: The Doctor and his Daughter

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,650
Dr Iannis had enjoyed a satisfactory day in
which none of his patients had died or got

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,070
any worse.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,340
He had removed a tooth, attended the surprisingly
easy birth of a lamb, and had performed a

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,660
successful, though minor, operation.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,380
He had been called to the house of old man
Stamatis, who was suffering from earache.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,290
After gazing into the dark, hairy hole of
the old man's ear, the doctor had cleaned

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,160
up the inside of the ear using a matchstick,
cotton wool and alcohol.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,410
He was aware that old man Stamatis had been
deaf in that ear since childhood, but was

10
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,360
nevertheless surprised when the tip of the
matchstick touched something hard, something

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,109
that had no excuse for its presence there.

12
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,179
He took the old man to the window, where the
light was better, and stared down into the

13
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:08,869
ear again; then with his long matchstick he
pushed the grey hairs to one side.

14
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,649
There was something round inside.

15
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:15,369
He scratched its surface and saw a pea.

16
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:21,070
It was undoubtedly a pea; it was light green
and slightly lined.

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,789
Dr Iannis considered the problem for some
moments, then requested a small fishhook and

18
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:29,190
a light hammer.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,000
The old man and his wife looked at each other
with the single thought that the doctor must

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
have lost his mind.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,369
'What does this have to do with my earache?'

22
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,200
asked Stamatis suspiciously.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,210
But the hook and hammer were fetched, and
the doctor carefully placed the straightened

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,979
hook into the hairy hole and raised the hammer.

25
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,340
There was a terrible scream.

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,039
'Oh, oh, the fishhook will enter his brain.

27
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,070
May God protect us!'

28
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,590
cried the old wife, hiding her head in her
hands.

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,750
This speech caused the doctor to pause and
consider the possibility that the hammer might

30
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,520
only drive the pea further into the ear.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,220
'Change of plan,' he announced, and gave instructions
that Stamatis should lie on his side till

32
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,540
evening with his ear filled with warm water.

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:28,050
He returned at six o'clock, hooked the softened
pea successfully without the aid of a hammer,

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,959
small or otherwise, and pulled it out.

35
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,160
Stamatis clapped his hand to his ear and exclaimed,
'It's cold in there.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,430
My God, it's loud.

37
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,280
I mean everything is loud!'

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,300
'Your deafness is cured,' announced Dr Iannis.

39
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,030
'A very satisfactory operation, I think.'

40
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,560
Shortly afterwards he walked home with a fat
chicken under each arm, and an ancient pea

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,610
wrapped up in his handkerchief.

42
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:03,280
The doctor was now left with an entire evening
in which to write his 'New History of Cephallonia',

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,060
a project which he had begun at least a dozen
times.

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,960
He seemed unable to achieve objectivity and
so had never been satisfied with the result.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,810
He sat down and wrote:

46
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:23,840
'The ancient, half-forgotten island of Cephallonia
rises from the Ionian Sea, its rocks and red

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,630
earth heavy with the heat of the sun and the
weight of memory.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,570
In the stories of ancient Greece, the island
played its part and had its gods - among them

49
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,950
Poseidon, the god of the Sea and Apollo, the
god of the Sun.

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes, once this island, with its brilliant
light, its transparent waters, was an island

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,170
filled with gods.

52
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,670
But today Cephallonia has become a factory
that breeds babies for export.

53
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,880
There are more Cephallonians abroad or at
sea than there are at home.

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,230
There is no industry here that keeps families
together, there is not enough agricultural

55
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,810
land, there are not enough fish in the ocean.

56
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,230
Our men go abroad and return here to die.

57
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,160
The only good thing about it is that only
the beautiful women find husbands among the

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,770
men who are left, and consequently we have
the most beautiful women in all of Greece...'

59
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,660
The doctor refilled his pipe and read this
through.

60
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,500
He listened to Pelagia moving about in the
kitchen, preparing the evening meal.

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,450
He read what he had written about beautiful
women and remembered his wife, who had died

62
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,660
from lung disease despite all his efforts
and who had been as lovely as his daughter

63
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,880
was now.

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,780
'This island betrays its own people,' he wrote,
then seized the sheet of paper and threw it

65
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,560
forcefully into the corner of the room.

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,870
This was not good enough.

67
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,220
Why could he not write like a writer of histories?

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,350
Why could he not write without passion, without
anger at the many betrayals and oppressions

69
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,600
that the island had suffered in the past?

70
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,340
He went outside for a breath of fresh air,
returning indoors just in time to catch Pelagia's

71
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,760
little goat eating his writings with a look
of satisfaction on its face.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,110
He tore the paper from the animal's mouth,
chased it outside, then marched into the kitchen.

73
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,270
'That unpleasant animal of yours has eaten
everything I've written tonight,' he exclaimed

74
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
crossly.

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,210
'Any more incidents like this, and it'll end
up on our plates.'

76
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,830
Pelagia looked up at her father and smiled.

77
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,920
'We'll be eating at about ten o'clock.'

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,810
'Did you hear what I said?

79
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,550
No more goats inside the house.'

80
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,330
Pelagia paused in her slicing of a tomato,
brushed her hair from her face and replied,

81
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,950
'You're as fond of him as I am.'

82
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,120
Dr Iannis turned away, defeated.

83
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,840
It was an annoying thing when a daughter spoke
cheekily to him and reminded him of her mother

84
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,530
at the same time.

85
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:15,260
He returned to his table, took the title page,
'A New History of Cephallonia', and crossed

86
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,040
out the first two words, writing instead,
'A Personal'.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,560
Now he could express his opinions as freely
and unpleasantly as he wished.

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,960
When Pelagia heard from a neighbour that a
strongman was giving a performance in the

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,110
village square, she put away her broom and
hurried to join the group of curious islanders

90
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,260
that had gathered there.

91
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,200
Megalo Velisarios, famous all over the islands
of Ionia as one of the strongest men who had

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,800
ever lived, was jumping up and down in time
to the clapping of hands.

93
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,110
On each of his outstretched arms sat a full-grown
man.

94
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,460
One of them held on tightly to his body while
the other calmly smoked a cigarette.

95
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,540
On Vehsarios's head sat an anxious little
girl of about six years, who was making matters

96
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,260
more complicated by holding her hands firmly
across his eyes.

97
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,370
'Lemoni!' he roared.

98
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,780
'Take your hands from my eyes and hold on
to my hair, or I'll have to stop.'

99
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,090
Lemoni was too frightened to move her hands
and Megalo Velisarios stopped.

100
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,120
With one graceful movement he threw both men
to their feet, lifted Lemoni from his head,

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,170
threw her high into the air and caught her,
kissed her dramatically upon the tip of her

102
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,740
nose and set her down.

103
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,350
Raising himself to his full height, he cried,
'I will lift anything that it takes three

104
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,090
men to lift.'

105
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,990
The village priest, Father Arsenios, chose
just this moment to walk with a self-important

106
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,180
expression across the square on his way to
the church.

107
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,350
He lacked respect, not because he was completely
round but because he was greedy for both money

108
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,280
and food and was much too interested in women.

109
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,681
'Lift Father Arsenios,' someone called.

110
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:20,139
'Impossible,' called another.

111
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,710
Father Arsenios quite suddenly found himself
grasped around his chest and lifted up on

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,280
to the wall.

113
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,460
He sat there speechless with surprise, his
mouth opening and closing like a fish, and

114
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,839
a guilty silence descended.

115
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,550
Pelagia felt her heart overflow with pity
for the poor man.

116
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,199
She stepped forward and extended a hand to
help him down, and the priest walked off without

117
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,360
a word.

118
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,470
Pelagia now spoke sharply to Velisarios.

119
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,360
She was only seventeen but she was proud and
knew her own mind, and her position as the

120
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
doctor's daughter meant that even the men
were forced to respect her.

121
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,649
'You shouldn't have done that, Velisarios,'
she said.

122
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,529
'It was cruel and horrible.

123
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,860
You must apologize.'

124
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,200
He looked down at her from his great height.

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,670
This was without doubt a difficult situation.

126
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,339
He thought of lifting her above his head.

127
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:27,660
'We want to see the cannon,' called an old
lady, and others in the crowd echoed her.

128
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,839
Velisarios was immensely proud of his ability
to raise the old Turkish cannon, which had

129
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,529
the date 1739 on it and was much too heavy
for anyone else to lift.

130
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:47,040
He looked down at Pelagia and said, 'I'll
apologize later, pretty one,' then announced,

131
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,370
'Good people of the village, to see the cannon,
you must bring me your old nails, your broken

132
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,680
pots, and the stones of the streets.

133
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,319
Find me these things while I pack the gun
with powder.'

134
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:07,679
People ran off eagerly in all directions to
seek out these objects, and the cannon was

135
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,430
soon prepared for the great explosion.

136
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,559
'I will fire the gun down the road,' said
Velisarios when all was made ready.

137
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,100
'Everybody out of the way now.'

138
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,420
With a theatrical expression, the enormous
man put a match to the cannon and lifted it

139
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,929
to his waist.

140
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,040
Silence fell.

141
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,069
Breaths were held.

142
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:37,930
There was a great roar as the old pots and
nails burst from the gun... and then a long,

143
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,850
low cry of pain.

144
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,800
There was a moment of confusion and hesitation.

145
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,540
People looked around at each other to see
who had been hit, and Velisarios dropped his

146
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,879
cannon and ran forward to a young man lying
in the dust.

147
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,230
Mandras later thanked Velisarios for firing
at him as he came round the bend at the entrance

148
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,230
to the village.

149
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,399
But at the time he greatly disliked being
carried in the arms of the strongman to the

150
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,459
doctor's house and he did not enjoy having
a bent nail removed from his shoulder.

151
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:19,369
What he thanked Megalo Velisarios for was
that in the doctor's house he first set eyes

152
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,829
on Pelagia.

153
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,269
There was a moment when he became aware that
he was being bandaged, that a young woman's

154
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,089
long hair was brushing against his face.

155
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,920
He opened his eyes and found himself gazing
into a pair of anxious eyes.

156
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:43,720
'At that moment,' he liked to say later, 'I
recognized my future wife.'

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,769
Dr Iannis put on a fresh shirt in readiness
for his daily visit to the kapheneion, and

158
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,899
stepped out into the yard.

159
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,410
He was entirely unsurprised to see Mandras
there, talking to Pelagia.

160
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,110
The young fisherman's face went red when he
saw him.

161
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,540
'Oh, good evening, doctor.

162
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,420
I've brought you some fish,' he said.

163
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,730
The doctor twisted his mouth and pretended
to sigh.

164
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:15,120
'Mandras,' he said, 'you know perfectly well
that I know perfectly well that you have only

165
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,059
come here to flirt with Pelagia.'

166
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,059
'Flirt?'

167
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,139
repeated the young man, attempting to appear
both innocent and shocked.

168
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,139
'Yes.

169
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,139
Flirt.

170
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,860
Yesterday you brought us another fish and
then flirted with Pelagia for an hour.

171
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,509
Well, you'd better get on with it.'

172
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,029
'Then I have your permission to talk to your
daughter?'

173
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:43,220
'Talk, talk, talk,' said Dr Iannis, waving
his hands, and he set off for the kapheneion.

174
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,089
'Your dad's a funny fellow,' Mandras said
to Pelagia.

175
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:51,649
'There's nothing wrong with my father,' she
exclaimed, 'and anyone who says there is gets

176
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,600
a broom in the face.'

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,749
She pushed the broom at him and he caught
it and twisted it out of her grasp.

178
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:01,519
'Give it back,' she said laughing.

179
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,399
'I'll give it back... in return for a kiss.'

180
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,410
Pelagia gave the young man a flirtatious smile.

181
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:16,319
At the kapheneion, the doctor collected his
tiny cup of coffee and sat next to Kokolios,

182
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,980
as he always did.

183
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,220
The coffee shop was full of the usual characters:
the Communist Kokolios, with his splendid

184
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,170
moustache; old man Stamatis; Father Arsenios,
round and sweating.

185
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,500
'What's the news of the war?'

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,360
Kokolios asked.

187
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,439
The doctor twisted the ends of his moustache
and said, 'Germany is taking everything, the

188
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:44,899
Italians are behaving like fools, the French
have run away, the Americans have been playing

189
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:50,549
ball games, the British have been drinking
tea, the Russians have been sitting on their

190
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,549
hands.

191
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:54,079
Thank God we are out of it.

192
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,779
Why don't we turn on the radio?'

193
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,339
The large British radio in the corner of the
room was switched on, its whistles reduced

194
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,250
to a minimum by moving it around.

195
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:11,369
Just then, Pelagia appeared at the door, gesturing
urgently, greatly embarrassed by her presence

196
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,839
in the men-only kapheneion.

197
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,660
The doctor raised his eyes to the ceiling,
put his pipe in his pocket and went to the

198
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
door.

199
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,410
'What is it, girl?'

200
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,170
'It's Mandras, he's fallen out of a tree on
to a pot.'

201
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,600
The doctor shook his head in disbelief and
allowed his daughter to hurry him home.

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,649
There, he made Mandras lie on the kitchen
table while he removed tiny pieces of the

203
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,569
broken pot from the young man's muscular back.

204
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,809
'You're a fool,' he told his patient.

205
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,970
'I know, doctor,' said Mandras, biting his
lip as another piece came out.

206
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,509
'Stop being so polite.

207
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:50,939
I know what you're planning.

208
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,209
Are you going to ask her to marry you or not?'

209
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,300
'Not yet, doctor.

210
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,480
Everyone says there's going to be a war, and
I don't want to leave a widow.

211
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,129
You know how people treat a widow.'

212
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:09,731
'Quite right,' said the doctor and wondered,
as he wiped away a spot of blood, whether

213
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:15,029
his body had ever been as beautiful as this
young fool's.

214
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,850
It was several hours before he returned to
the kapheneion.

215
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,560
When he entered, he knew immediately that
something was wrong.

216
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,970
Warlike music came from the radio and Dr Iannis
was astonished to see that the faces of several

217
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,290
of the men were shiny with tears.

218
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,720
'What's going on?' he asked.

219
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,350
'Those Italian pigs have sunk one of our ships
at Tinos.

220
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,949
And they fired on the harbour there.

221
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,160
It was full of people.

222
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,500
On a holy day too.'

223
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,859
The doctor put his hands to his face and felt
his own tears fighting to appear.

224
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:56,600
He was possessed by a feeling of helpless
anger.

225
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,370
He did not stop to question whether war with
Italy was inevitable.

226
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:07,739
Although he did not believe in God he found
himself saying, 'Come on boys, we're all going

227
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,889
to the church.'

228
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:17,089
The men of the kapheneion rose and followed
him.

229
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,709
CHAPTER TWO
Pelagia and Mandras

230
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:29,579
Pelagia (resting in the afternoon): Papas
says that Mandras is going to have tiny pieces

231
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,559
of that pot in his back for the rest of his
life.

232
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,699
I like his body, what I've seen of it.

233
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,370
God forgive me, I have such wicked thoughts.

234
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,889
Thank God no one can read my mind, or I'd
be locked up and all the old women would throw

235
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,929
stones at me.

236
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,230
I wonder what Mandras is doing.

237
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,160
He's so beautiful and so tunny too.

238
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,649
He made my stomach ache with laughing before
he fell out of the tree.

239
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:05,100
That's when I knew I loved him; it was the
fear I felt when he fell on the pot.

240
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,299
When will he ask me to marry him?

241
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,990
But he's not a serious fellow, and it gives
me doubts.

242
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,839
He's so funny, but I can't talk to him about
anything and you have to be able to discuss

243
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,929
things with a husband, don't you?

244
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:26,069
I say, 'Is there going to be a war?' and he
just grins and says, 'Who cares?

245
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,299
Is there going to be a kiss?'

246
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,399
I don't want there to be a war.

247
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:35,610
Let there be Mandras standing in the yard
with a fish in his hands.

248
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,220
Let there be Mandras every day with a fish.

249
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,899
Mandras (leaving the harbour in his boat):
It's going to be too hot again today, I know

250
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:52,350
it, and all the fish will hide in the rocks
and go to the bottom.

251
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,679
Let the clouds hide the sun, let me catch
some fine fish and I'll take one to Pelagia

252
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,919
and she'll ask me to eat with them, and I
can rub her leg with my foot under the table

253
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,850
while the doctor discusses ancient poetry.

254
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,520
I know he likes me, but he doesn't think I'm
good enough for her - he's always calling

255
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,460
me a fool.

256
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,020
The trouble is that I can't be myself when
I'm with her.

257
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,960
I mean, I am a serious man.

258
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,320
I follow politics, I want to improve the world.

259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,930
But when I'm with Pelagia it's as if I'm twelve
again.

260
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,630
I want to amuse her and what else am I supposed
to do?

261
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:39,690
I can't imagine myself saying, 'Come on, Pelagia,
let's talk about politics.'

262
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,390
Women aren't interested in that sort of thing,
they want you to entertain them.

263
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,850
Perhaps she thinks I'm a fool as well.

264
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,299
I'm not in her class, I know that.

265
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,000
The doctor taught her Italian and a bit of
English, and they're not a typical island

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
family.

267
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,750
I mean, the doctor's sailed all over the world,
he's even been to America.

268
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,480
And where have I been?

269
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,500
What do I know?

270
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:12,740
I love Pelagia, but I know that I will never
be a man until I've done something important,

271
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,940
something people can respect me for.

272
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,150
I feel so useless and insignificant here on
the island.

273
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:28,010
Pelagia (taking roast lamb from the village
oven): Where is Mandras?

274
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,909
He's usually here by now.

275
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,720
I want him to come, I can hardly breathe,
I want him so much.

276
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,399
My hands are shaking again.

277
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:41,740
I'd better take this silly smile off my face
or everyone will think I'm mad.

278
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:49,460
Come, Mandras, please come, stay for dinner
and stroke my ankles with your feet, Mandras.

279
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,860
Mandras (mending his nets): We're going to
go to war with Italy very soon.

280
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,510
I've got a letter saying that I'll be ordered
to join the army in the next few weeks.

281
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,010
I know one thing, I'm going to ask Pelagia
to marry me before I leave.

282
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,309
With no jokes.

283
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:13,250
I'm going to make her understand that in defending
Greece I'm defending her and every woman like

284
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:19,149
her, and if I die, I'll die with the name
of Pelagia and the name of Greece equally

285
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,370
on my lips.

286
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,769
And if I live, I'll walk with my head held
high for the rest of my life, and everyone

287
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,769
will say, 'That's Mandras, who fought in the
war.

288
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,970
We owe everything to people like him.'

289
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:40,750
The island's saint, St Geronimos, dead for
five centuries, had lived a genuinely holy

290
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:47,450
life and had left his ancient blackened body
in an island church as evidence of this.

291
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,490
He was so loved by the islanders that he had
two feast days, one in August and another

292
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:59,510
in October, and on these days he tolerantly
looked elsewhere as the population of the

293
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,590
island became excessively drunk.

294
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,340
It was eight days before Greece and Italy
declared war on each other, but it might have

295
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,399
been any October feast day in the last hundred
years.

296
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,710
The cruelty had gone out of the sun, and the
delightfully warm day was made even more pleasant

297
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,240
by a light wind from the sea that wandered
in and out of the trees.

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,620
From all over the island, people made their
way to the church where the saint's body lay,

299
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,880
packing the church tightly and squeezing together
in the yard outside.

300
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:40,169
At different points in the crowd, Velisarios,
Pelagia, Dr Iannis, Kokolios and Stamatis

301
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,570
all turned their heads sideways to hear the
distant prayers of the priest.

302
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:52,880
The sun climbed higher and the people, packed
together, began to sweat.

303
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,450
The heat was just becoming unbearable when
the service ended, the bells rang out and

304
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,529
the celebrations began.

305
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,880
A small band began playing while a line of
pretty girls stepped from side to side at

306
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,340
the back, and a row of young men danced with
their heads twisted backwards.

307
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,960
Those who were drunk began to insult each
other, and in some places fighting had already

308
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,230
begun.

309
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,029
Pelagia moved nearer the church and sat on
a bench.

310
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:27,389
Someone tapped on her shoulder and she looked
up and saw Mandras.

311
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:35,299
He fell drunkenly to his knees and declared
dramatically, 'Pelagia, will you marry me?

312
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,660
Marry me or I die!'

313
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:45,309
She regarded him silently for a moment, then
said quietly, 'Of course I'll marry you,'

314
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:50,990
When he heard this, Mandras leapt joyfully
but unsteadily into the air, then suddenly

315
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:58,539
became extremely serious and said, 'My darling,
I love you with all my heart, but we can't

316
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:01,789
get married until I get back from the Army.'

317
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,660
'Go and speak to my father,' said Pelagia.

318
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,809
Then, worried by the strange way in which
she did not feel as happy as she ought, she

319
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:15,110
made her way back to the church in order to
be alone with the saint.

320
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,830
Time passed, and Mandras failed to find the
doctor before drink overcame him.

321
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:28,529
He slept sweetly in a pool of something disgusting
but unidentifiable, while, nearby, Lemoni

322
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:33,759
attempted to set fire to the beard of the
sleeping Father Arsenios, and Kokolios and

323
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,190
Stamatis became lost in the bushes while searching
for their wives.

324
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:43,309
Pelagia walked back from the feast with her
father, bursting with a painful mixture of

325
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:48,980
anxiety and happiness, desperate to mention
Mandras's proposal.

326
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,389
But the doctor was in a much too drunken state
to be sensitive to his daughter's feelings,

327
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:58,700
and when they reached the house, he danced
about the yard before falling onto his bed

328
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,950
fully clothed.

329
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,980
Pelagia went to bed and could not sleep.

330
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,480
'I love you, Mandras,' she declared, at the
same time as doubts rose in her like an invasion

331
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,779
of tiny devils.

332
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,940
How much did she really know Mandras?

333
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,909
What evidence did she have that he was patient
and kind?

334
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,850
Can you trust someone who replies immediately,
without thought?

335
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,879
She was frightened by the suspicion that there
was something hard about his heart.

336
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:36,380
If it were not love that she felt for Mandras,
then why this breathlessness, this endless

337
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,960
desire that made her heart beat fast?

338
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,200
She imagined that Mandras had died, and as
the tears came she was shocked to discover

339
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,290
that she also felt relief.

340
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:55,000
In the morning she took herself to the yard
and created tasks that would cause her to

341
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,049
see him as soon as he came around the curve
of the road.

342
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:04,330
But he did not come, and Pelagia passed the
day with feelings of impatience that soon

343
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,620
turned into real concern.

344
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,441
That evening, when he had still not appeared,
her father said, quite unexpectedly, 'I expect

345
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:16,960
he hasn't come because he's feeling as sick
as everyone else.'

346
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,669
Pelagia took his hand and kissed it gratefully.

347
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:22,250
'He's asked me to marry him.

348
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,440
I told him I'd have to ask you,' she said.

349
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,100
'I don't want to marry Mandras,' said Dr Iannis.

350
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,250
'It would be a much better idea if he married
you, I think.'

351
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,559
'Don't you approve of him, Papakis?'

352
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
He turned and looked at her gently.

353
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,920
'He's too young.

354
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,220
Also, I have not done you a favour.

355
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,080
You read poetry, you speak Italian.

356
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,759
He isn't your equal, and he would expect to
be better than his wife.

357
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,509
He is a man, after all.

358
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:58,830
I have often thought that you would only ever
be able to marry happily with a foreigner,

359
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,059
a dentist from Norway or something.'

360
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:07,460
Pelagia laughed at the ridiculous thought,
then closed her eyes.

361
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,639
The doctor went inside and came out with something
that he handed very formally to her.

362
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:18,879
She took it, saw what it was, and dropped
it into her skirts with a cry of horror.

363
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,450
The doctor remained standing.

364
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:28,490
'There's going to be a war, and terrible things
happen in wars, especially to women.

365
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,350
Use the gun to defend yourself.

366
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,669
It might happen that your marriage will have
to wait.

367
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:39,399
We must make sure first that Mussolini does
not invite himself to the wedding.'

368
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,100
He turned and went into the house, leaving
Pelagia to her fears, and after a few minutes

369
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,480
she went to her room and placed the gun under
her pillow, imagining once again that Mandras

370
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,080
was dead.

371
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,840
It was not until the third day after the feast
that there was a quiet knock at the door.

372
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,559
Mandras stood, speaking fast, a bucket of
fish in his hand.

373
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:09,429
'I'm sorry I didn't come sooner, but I was
ill the day after the feast, and yesterday

374
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:14,590
I had to collect my Army papers, and I'm leaving
for Athens the day after tomorrow, and I've

375
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,020
spoken to your father, and he's agreed to
the marriage, and I've brought you some fish.'

376
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:28,870
Pelagia sat on her bed and went cold inside;
it was too much happiness, too much pain.

377
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,309
She was engaged to a man who mixed marriage
together with fish and war, a man who was

378
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,020
too beautiful to go away and die in the snows
of Tsamoria.

379
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,740
Suddenly Mandras seemed to her to be an extraordinarily
delicate creature, so delicate and beautiful

380
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,370
that he was sure to die.

381
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:58,360
Her hands began to shake and she whispered,
'Don't go, don't go.'

382
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,090
CHAPTER THREE
The Homosexual

383
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:09,340
I, Carlo Piero Guercio, write these words
with the intention that they should be found

384
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,679
after my death, when what is written here
will not harm me.

385
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,179
I know only silence.

386
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:23,620
I have not told the priest, since I know in
advance what I will be told; it is a wicked

387
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,220
sin and I must marry and lead the life of
a normal man.

388
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,340
Nor have I told a doctor, as I know that I
will be informed that I am sick and can be

389
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,149
cured of my disease.

390
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:38,789
What could I say to such priests and doctors?

391
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:45,179
I would say to the priest that God made me
like this for a purpose, that I had no choice.

392
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,419
I would say to the doctor, 'I have been like
this from the start, it is nature that has

393
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,100
created me.'

394
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,580
But they would not understand.

395
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,630
I am like someone who is the only person in
the world that knows the truth, but is forbidden

396
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,630
to speak.

397
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:08,940
And this truth weighs more than the universe,
this burden cracks my bones.

398
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,460
In my search to understand myself, I have
read everything, from the most modern to the

399
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,480
most ancient, and it was in the work of the
ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, that I finally

400
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,519
found myself.

401
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:29,430
In his writings, he explained that there were
three sexes, the third sex being men who loved

402
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,659
men, and this idea made sense to me.

403
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:39,320
Plato also wrote that if an army was made
up of men who loved one another, they would

404
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,330
be the bravest army in the world, because
men would become heroes, ready to die for

405
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,070
their lovers.

406
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,970
I admit that I joined the Army because the
men are young and beautiful, and because I

407
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,630
knew that in the Army I would find someone
I could love though never touch.

408
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:05,220
I would not abandon him in battle, I would
win his admiration, I would die for him if

409
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:11,220
necessary and in this way give purpose to
my life.

410
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,750
In the Army I found my family.

411
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:21,850
It was a world without women, and for the
first time in my life I did not have to pretend.

412
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:29,269
I was very fortunate at first; our unit was
sent to Albania, where there was no real fighting,

413
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,679
and we did not realize that we might be ordered
to invade Greece.

414
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,600
No one outside the Army can understand the
joy of being a soldier, of being part of a

415
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,789
group where you are all young and strong and
quickly learn everything about each other.

416
00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:52,009
We believed we could not die, we could march
eighty kilometres a day, singing battle songs.

417
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:57,019
We were new and beautiful, we loved each other
more than brothers.

418
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:05,020
I fell in love with Francesco, a young married
soldier from Genoa, who accepted me as his

419
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,940
best friend without ever suspecting my passion
for him.

420
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,389
He was an entirely beautiful boy, reminding
me of one of those elegant cats that give

421
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:21,009
the impression of immense but easy strength.

422
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:27,750
I was attracted most of all to his face, with
its strong, high cheekbones, wide mouth and

423
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,129
one-sided smile.

424
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:35,429
He was always amusing and respected no one,
constantly entertaining us with his wickedly

425
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,419
accurate imitations of Mussolini and Hitler.

426
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,590
Everyone loved him, he never got a promotion
and he did not care.

427
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:51,090
We soldiers loved the army life but had no
love of the Fascist leaders of our country,

428
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,049
nor did we have any idea of why we were in
Albania.

429
00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:03,740
However, looking back, it seems clear that
an invasion of Greece must have been the final

430
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,820
intention; there were clues everywhere, if
only we had seen them.

431
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,909
In the first place, there was the fact that
all the roads that we built (which, we were

432
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:20,320
informed, were for the benefit of the Albanians)
led towards the Greek border.

433
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,710
In the second place, we heard stories from
reliable sources about how our frontier posts

434
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,929
were attacked a number of times by our own
people dressed as Greeks, so that we could

435
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,090
blame the latter for the attacks.

436
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,389
When some Albanians shot at our soldiers,
we announced that our attackers were Greeks.

437
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:47,309
We also learned that one of our leaders arranged
to have his own offices blown up so that Mussolini

438
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,110
could finally declare war against the Greeks.

439
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:58,520
I have related these things as if they were
amusing, but really they were acts of madness.

440
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,309
When war against Greece was finally declared,
we were told that the Greeks would be defeated

441
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:04,340
within days.

442
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,649
We were sent off to die, with no transport,
no equipment and too few men.

443
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:18,149
At first, having no idea of what the future
held for us, we whistled and sang, and from

444
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:22,990
time to time Francesco, marching beside me,
looked at me and smiled.

445
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,980
'Athens in two weeks,' he said.

446
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,549
Then the weather turned against us and rain
poured from the skies, turning the ground

447
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:38,419
to mud so that we struggled through it, ten
thousand men whose uniforms were weighted

448
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:43,899
down with water, our aeroplanes unable to
fly because of the bad weather.

449
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:50,440
Our twenty heavy guns sank into the mud, and
our animals were unable to pull them out.

450
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,200
We struggled on in these conditions for several
days, at a height of three hundred metres,

451
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,350
our legs turned to ice so that we could no
longer feel our feet.

452
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,350
'Athens in two months,' said Francesco with
a twisted smile.

453
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:13,090
But we saw no sign of the Greeks and believed
that we were winning without fighting.

454
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:19,170
On 1 November, a bomb fell among us and there
was a scream as a poor fellow from Piedmont

455
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:24,790
lost his legs, followed by the short, sharp
sound of gunshot from the trees.

456
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:30,100
We realized that the Greeks had cleverly got
us into a position where we could be surrounded

457
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,890
and cut off from all help.

458
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:38,530
We were trapped in the valley floor and the
Greeks, whom we very rarely saw, moved like

459
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,020
ghosts among the upper slopes, so that we
never knew when we would be attacked or from

460
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
where.

461
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,280
Their bombs seemed at one moment to come from
behind, at another moment to come from the

462
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,190
side or from the front.

463
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,830
We fired at ghosts and at mountain goats.

464
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,120
The heroic Greeks seemed to rise out of the
ground and fall on us as if we had raped their

465
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
mothers.

466
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,420
It shocked us.

467
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,560
We had no air support.

468
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,350
'Athens in two years,' said Francesco.

469
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,010
We were completely alone.

470
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:20,230
We ate only dry biscuits, but when our horses
died, we ate them.

471
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:25,380
We were ordered to turn back and had to fight
our way through the soldiers that surrounded

472
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,460
us.

473
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:33,240
We grew immense beards, we were half buried
in snowstorms, our red, swollen eyes sank

474
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,450
deep into our heads, our hands were torn as
if by cats.

475
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:44,880
We became desperately thin, digging for food
in the frozen ground like pigs.

476
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,700
It was a hell of machine guns, bombs and ice,
a hell in which battles were fought without

477
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,960
rest for eight hours at a time, while on the
mountains our dead lay in forgotten piles,

478
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,610
body upon body.

479
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:04,920
We fought on but we lost our hearts as a great
darkness settled across the land.

480
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,640
The snow fell endlessly.

481
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,740
My boots, crawling with insects, fell apart.

482
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:19,350
I think it must have been December when we
understood that we were as broken as our boots.

483
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,410
Waking up in the morning, ten degrees below
zero.

484
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,920
The first question: who has frozen to death
now?

485
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Who has slipped from sleep to death?

486
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,590
These were the days of the white death, in
which the legs became swollen and turned bright

487
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:41,430
purple, deep blue, coal black.

488
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,100
I was exhausted, shaken by the screams of
men in unimaginable pain as their legs were

489
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,680
cut off by our army doctors.

490
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,510
I lived in fear of the white death and inspected
my feet every few hours.

491
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,670
Francesco was undoubtedly mad.

492
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:04,790
His mouth moved continually, his beard became
a column of ice, his eyes rolled in his head

493
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,730
and he did not recognize me.

494
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,100
We had lost four thousand men.

495
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:17,840
There was nothing in our lives except the
white death, the bitter absence of our friends,

496
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,590
the joylessness of the icy mountains.

497
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,910
One morning Francesco turned to me with a
wild expression in his eyes, speaking to me

498
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,100
for the first time in weeks.

499
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:35,130
'Look,' he said and rolled up his trousers,
revealing the purple stripes on the white

500
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,780
flesh.

501
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,070
He touched the dead flesh with a look of horror
in his eyes, rolled his trousers back down

502
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,070
again and said to me, 'It's enough, Carlo.

503
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,120
It's too much.'

504
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,410
He began to weep, trembling all over.

505
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:59,160
Then he took up his gun and, before I could
prevent him, advanced towards the enemy, stopping

506
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,790
to fire every five steps.

507
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:09,720
In recognition of his heroism, the Greeks
did not return his fire, but a bomb fell next

508
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,510
to him and he disappeared beneath a shower
of mud.

509
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,850
There was a long silence.

510
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:20,760
I saw something move where Francesco had been.

511
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,900
I put my gun down and ran towards the place
where he lay.

512
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,660
The Greeks did not shoot at me and I saw that
although the side of his head had been blown

513
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,740
away, he was still alive.

514
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:43,540
I knelt and gathered him into my arms, then
stood up and faced the Greeks, offering myself

515
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,910
to their guns.

516
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,920
There was a silence, and then a cheer came
from them.

517
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,870
I turned and carried the bleeding bundle back
to our side.

518
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,320
Francesco took two hours to die.

519
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:07,420
His blood ran down my uniform, his mouth formed
silent words, the light in his eyes faded

520
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:14,410
and he began the long, slow journey towards
death, suffering what must have been indescribable

521
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,380
pain.

522
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:23,060
I buried him in a deep hole, the home of enormous
rats.

523
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:29,190
We lost the war and were saved only when the
Germans invaded from Bulgaria, forcing the

524
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,810
Greeks to fight two different armies at the
same time.

525
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,840
We fought and froze and died for no purpose.

526
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,540
I took no part in the shameful conquest of
Greece because the day after I buried Francesco,

527
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:51,070
I shot myself in the flesh of my thigh.

528
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,280
CHAPTER FOUR
The Wild Man

529
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,660
On 28 October, Greece and Italy formally declared
war on each other.

530
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,270
All the young men of Cephallonia disappeared
to join the army, and Dr Iannis attempted

531
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,430
to join too but was turned down when it was
discovered that he had learned all his medical

532
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,630
knowledge on ships and had no proper qualifications.

533
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,900
Several Italian families on the island were
attacked and their houses were burnt down,

534
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,020
and the islanders developed a silent, sorrowful
expression as they learnt to live with the

535
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,540
thought that their sons and brothers might
die.

536
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,330
As the weeks passed, however, they were comforted
by the news that their country was winning

537
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:40,650
the war and that the Greeks were winning back
territory that was theirs by right in Albania.

538
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:46,420
The villagers went often to church and Father
Arsenios surprised them by making fine, emotional

539
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,880
speeches and by not getting drunk.

540
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,420
Almost immediately, shortages of certain foods
and other household essentials developed,

541
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,770
and beans became the greater part of the doctor's
and Pelagia's diet.

542
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:07,100
The war had the effect of increasing the importance
of Dr Iannis, as the village community turned

543
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,660
to him for advice and leadership.

544
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,880
The doctor watched his daughter progress through
a series of emotions, all of which seemed

545
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,830
to him to be unhealthy and worrying.

546
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:25,540
At first Pelagia had been in a state of painful
anxiety, and then in storms of tears.

547
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,240
She would sit by the wall outside as if she
expected her fiance to arrive at the bend

548
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,350
of the road where he had been shot by Velisarios.

549
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:39,240
Later, she developed the habit of remaining
silently in the room with her father, her

550
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,050
hands motionless in her lap as tears followed
each other silently down her cheeks.

551
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:50,990
Pelagia calmed her fears by writing letter
after letter to Mandras, relating island news

552
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:56,380
and gossip, telling him about her terrible
dreams and her fears for him, and begging

553
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,910
him to write back to her.

554
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,680
She began the task of making a cover for their
marriage bed, but lacked the benefit of a

555
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,650
mothers instruction in such matters.

556
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,700
Each time it reached a certain stage, it began
to look suspiciously like a dead animal, and

557
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,730
she felt forced to undo her work and begin
again.

558
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:23,940
As day followed day it became clear that not
only had Mandras not written, but that he

559
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,090
never would.

560
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,440
After careful observation of his daughter,
her father realized that she was becoming

561
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,830
bitter and increasingly certain that her fiance
could not love her.

562
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,770
When he realized that Pelagia was seriously
depressed, the doctor made her accompany him

563
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:48,470
on his medical visits, sent her to bed early
and let her sleep in the mornings.

564
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,910
He made a habit of making her laugh against
her will, and deliberately made her angry

565
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,920
by such tricks as moving all the knives from
one drawer to another.

566
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,040
The doctor considered the return of her normal
cheerful manner to be a sign that she had

567
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,980
given up her passion for Mandras.

568
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,770
On the one hand, he was glad of this, since
he did not truly believe that Mandras would

569
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:18,500
make a good husband, but on the other hand,
Pelagia was already engaged, and the breaking

570
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,520
of an engagement would cause great shame.

571
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,580
The awful possibility occurred to him that
Pelagia might marry a man she no longer loved

572
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,950
out of a sense of duty.

573
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:36,640
Pelagia returned from the village with a jar
of water upon her shoulder, set it down in

574
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,200
the yard and came through the door, singing.

575
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,590
The news had been bad for some weeks - not
only had Kokolios lost two of his sons, but

576
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:52,130
the Germans had attacked the Greek army so
that the courageous Greek troops were at last

577
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,150
facing defeat.

578
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:59,680
Strangely, the bad news made Pelagia even
more appreciative of the first signs of spring

579
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,530
on the island.

580
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,980
She was feeling strong and whole and was enjoying
having the house to herself while her father

581
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,980
was away visiting a friend on the other side
of the island.

582
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,310
Pelagia's singing was brought to a sudden
stop when she entered the kitchen.

583
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:22,580
There was a stranger seated at the kitchen
table, a most wild and horrible stranger,

584
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,170
whose hands trembled ceaselessly and whose
head was utterly hidden beneath a mass of

585
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,340
dirt, mud and hair.

586
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,690
An enormous beard hid the lower half of the
stranger's face, in which Pelagia could see

587
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,800
only two tiny bright eyes that would not look
at her.

588
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,160
Rags covered the stranger's body and in the
place of shoes there were bandages, stained

589
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,030
with blood both old and new.

590
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:58,710
Overcome with fear and pity, not knowing what
to do, Pelagia said, 'My father's out.

591
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,240
He should be back tomorrow.'

592
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,520
'You're happy, anyway.

593
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,900
Singing,' said the man in a cracked voice,
and his whole body shook.

594
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,750
'You can't stay, I'm on my own,' said Pelagia.

595
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,300
'I can't walk,' replied the man.

596
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,190
'I walked from Epirus.

597
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,550
No boots.'

598
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:29,150
Just then, the goat wandered through the open
kitchen door, approached the stranger and

599
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,570
made a gentle attempt at tasting the stranger's
rags.

600
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:42,560
'Ah, at least your goat remembers me,' the
man whispered, and began to weep.

601
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,910
Pelagia was astonished by these words and
said, 'Mandras?'

602
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:53,210
The man turned his face towards her and said,
'Don't touch me, Pelagia.

603
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,710
There are insects crawling all over me and
I smell terrible.'

604
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:04,310
Pelagia felt guilt, pity, disgust.

605
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:11,910
It seemed unimaginable that this pitiful ghost
hid the mind and body of the man she loved.

606
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,530
'You never wrote to me,' she said, making
the accusation that had destroyed her love

607
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,860
for him and left her empty.

608
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,560
Mandras replied, 'I can't write.'

609
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,630
For a reason she did not understand, Pelagia
was more disgusted by this confession than

610
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,990
by Mandras's physical condition.

611
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,100
'Couldn't someone else have written for you?

612
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,970
I thought you were dead.

613
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,430
I thought you... couldn't love me.'

614
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,210
'How could I let everyone know?

615
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,810
How could I have my feelings discussed by
the boys?'

616
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:54,690
He glanced up again so that at last she recognized
his eyes, and said, 'Pelagia, I got all your

617
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,690
letters.

618
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,850
I couldn't read them but I got them.'

619
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:03,100
From inside his clothing he drew out a huge,
dirty packet.

620
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,750
'I carried you in here,' he said, beating
his chest.

621
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:13,890
'Every day, all the time, I was thinking of
you, talking to you.

622
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,990
I was not a coward because of you, I even
prayed to you.

623
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:23,270
And when the Germans attacked us I got through
their lines, and all I could think of was

624
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,900
that I had to get home to you, and now...'

625
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,590
His body shook as he wept.

626
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,530
'Now only the animals know me.'

627
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:40,710
'I'll fetch your mother,' Pelagia whispered
and ran out of the house, down to the small,

628
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:47,110
fishy but extremely clean house by the harbour
where Kyria Drosoula, Mandras's widowed mother,

629
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,110
lived.

630
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,830
Kyria Drosoula was a woman so large and ugly
that at their first meeting people wondered

631
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,530
how she had ever found a husband.

632
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:03,580
She was in fact a brave, kind woman, and during
Mandras's absence she and Pelagia had comforted

633
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,290
one another.

634
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:10,560
Now the two women returned, breathless, to
the doctor's house, and found Mandras in exactly

635
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,900
the same position that Pelagia had left him
in.

636
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,950
Drosoula ran into the kitchen with a cry of
joy and then stepped back with an astonished

637
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,640
look that in other circumstances would have
been amusing.

638
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,920
'It is him,' said Pelagia.

639
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,980
'I told you he was in an awful state.'

640
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:35,150
'My God,' Drosoula exclaimed, then began to
inspect Mandras as if he were an animal she

641
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,550
was considering purchasing.

642
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:43,150
'Go and put a big pot to boil,' she said finally,
'because I'm going to wash him from head to

643
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:49,580
foot, but first I'm going to get rid of this
hair, so bring me some scissors.'

644
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:55,090
Mandras sat motionless as his mother, making
terrible faces as she did so, cut away the

645
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,660
ropes and lumps of his hair and beard, revealing
the horribly infected state of the skin below

646
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,810
and the insects creeping all over it.

647
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:09,490
Pelagia felt sickened where she knew that
she should feel pity, and went indoors to

648
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,270
look in her father's medicine cupboard.

649
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:17,350
She realized with a small shock that she had
learned enough from her father over the years

650
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,250
to become a doctor herself.

651
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:25,350
Hurrying outside, she told Drosoula which
treatments to use on Mandras's face and head

652
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:27,890
and where to use them.

653
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:32,440
After a brief discussion about whether it
was correct for a woman to see her fiance

654
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:40,530
with nothing on, the two women decided that
in these circumstances it was entirely acceptable.

655
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:46,040
They removed Mandras's rags, and after gazing
sorrowfully at the parcel of skin and bones

656
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:51,640
that sat before them, again under Pelagia's
expert guidance, Drosoula began washing her

657
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,500
son and rubbing healing oils and creams on
him.

658
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,210
Pelagia forced herself to remove the bandages
from Mandras's feet, and despite the fact

659
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:06,780
that at first sight they did not look as if
they could be saved, on closer examination

660
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,580
she realized that the flesh was quite dry.

661
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,180
She fetched a bowl of clean water, salted
it heavily, and as gently as she could, she

662
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,900
washed and treated the terrible mess.

663
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,150
When Dr Iannis returned the following morning,
he found not only a half-dead man asleep in

664
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:32,050
his daughter's bed, but his daughter and an
amazingly ugly woman asleep in his own.

665
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:37,290
He listened to Pelagia's account of everything
she had done, then examined the patient carefully,

666
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,870
paying particular attention to the feet.

667
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,740
Pelagia nervously waited for his anger.

668
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,810
'Well done, I have never been so proud,' he
declared.

669
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:55,400
Drosoula smiled at Pelagia, who was so relieved
that her hands were shaking, and the two women

670
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:01,780
made more plans for Mandras's recovery.

671
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:09,780
CHAPTER FIVE
30 April 1941: Invasion

672
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:16,250
Though he said little, being almost incapable
of speech due to his physical condition, Mandras

673
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,400
was fully aware of the change in Pelagia's
attitude towards him and he hated the way

674
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:26,850
in which his mother and fiancee had undressed
him, washed him and discussed him as if he

675
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,100
were not present.

676
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:34,450
But the horrors of war and starvation had
taken away from him the will to live, so that

677
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:41,170
he lay for weeks in bed in his mother's house,
incapable of moving or even speaking, constantly

678
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,080
revisiting in his mind the terrible experiences
that had been his.

679
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,400
The brilliance of his Greek leaders had enabled
him and many of his companions to survive

680
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,100
the war against the Italians, but the freezing
conditions in the mountains and lack of food

681
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,210
meant that his body aged more in a few months
than it would normally do in sixty years.

682
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:08,770
Then, when the Germans had attacked from the
south, Mandras's unit had marched back down

683
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:15,230
into Greece and had fought bravely but uselessly
against their enemy, leaving Mandras the only

684
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,950
survivor in his unit.

685
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:23,230
With a vision of a loving, smiling Pelagia
constantly before him, Mandras had found the

686
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:28,930
strength to struggle home, wearing bandages
instead of boots, through the wild hills,

687
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:33,480
mountains and forests that made up the greater
part of Greece.

688
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,150
For much of his journey he had met very few
people and had consequently almost died from

689
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,170
starvation.

690
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:46,430
If he had been met on his return to Cephallonia
by the loving Pelagia of his dreams, Mandras's

691
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,020
recovery might have been faster.

692
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:56,430
But as week followed week, Pelagia, though
she tried hard to love Mandras, felt only

693
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:02,330
coldness towards him, coldness and the growing
conviction that Mandras was remaining ill

694
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,780
in order to punish her for her lack of warmth
towards him.

695
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:13,280
'He thinks that nobody wants him,' said Dr
Iannis, 'and he's doing this in order to force

696
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,360
us to show him that we do.'

697
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:21,410
'But I don't want him,' thought Pelagia, again
and again, as she sat making the bedcover

698
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,140
that had never grown beyond the size of a
towel.

699
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,760
But although she spent a lot of time either
with or thinking about Mandras, there were

700
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,020
other matters that occupied her mind just
as much.

701
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:40,590
By April 1941, the German army had reached
Athens, and the royal palace there was occupied

702
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,880
not by King George of Greece but by German
soldiers.

703
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,900
On the 28th of the month, the Italian army,
claiming that the Ionian islands belonged

704
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,930
to them by right, invaded the island of Corfu,
making it inevitable that Cephallonia would

705
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,560
be next on the list.

706
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,690
For the islanders, the waiting was painful.

707
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:07,660
Every last moment of freedom and security
was rolled about on the tongue, tasted and

708
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,520
remembered.

709
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,260
Fathers who expected to be beaten to death
stroked the hair of pretty daughters who expected

710
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,410
to be raped.

711
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,260
Sons sat with their mothers on doorsteps and
talked gently of their memories.

712
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:26,910
Father Arsenios knelt in his church, attempting
to find words to a prayer, puzzled by an odd

713
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:33,420
sensation of having been abandoned by God
instead of the other way round.

714
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,210
In these last weeks before the invasion, Dr
Iannis wrote what he believed to be the final

715
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,130
part of his 'History of Cephallonia':

716
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:48,190
'Among those who invaded and occupied our
island - the Romans, the Turks, the Russians,

717
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:53,790
the French, the British' - he began, 'the
Italians made the greatest impression upon

718
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:01,730
us, because we spent the period from 1194
to 1797 under Italian rule.

719
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,930
This explains a great many things that may
puzzle the foreigner, for example, the numerous

720
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:12,251
Italian words that exist in our vocabulary,
and the architecture of the island, which

721
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:15,600
is almost entirely Italian.'

722
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,501
He continued on this subject for a number
of pages, then, when it seemed that the Italian

723
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:22,990
invasion was due at any moment, he wrote:

724
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:29,640
'I wait in the knowledge that this may be
the last thing I ever write.

725
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,710
I beg that whoever finds these papers should
preserve and not destroy them.'

726
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:41,620
Placing the papers in a black tin box, the
doctor lifted the old carpet beneath the table

727
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:47,580
and opened a trapdoor, revealing the large
hole that had been made in 1849 in order to

728
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,200
hide island rebels sought by the British,
who then governed the island.

729
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,750
He placed his work safely inside the hole,
then went outside to listen for the sound

730
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,660
of approaching aeroplanes.

731
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:05,830
On 30 April foreign aircraft and ships were
seen approaching from the horizon.

732
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:10,030
Drosoula ran inside to Pelagia shouting, 'Italians,
Italians.

733
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,630
It's the invasion,'

734
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:17,670
Pelagia's immediate reaction was to run up
the hill to be with her father, whom she found

735
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,660
standing in his doorway, as everyone else
stood in theirs, protecting his eyes against

736
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,750
the sun as he watched the planes.

737
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:31,670
Out of breath, she flew into his arms and
felt him tremble, then realized with a small

738
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:37,030
shock that he shook, not from fear, but from
excitement.

739
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:45,160
'History,' he cried, 'all this time I have
been writing history, and now history is happening

740
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,860
before my eyes.'

741
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,780
The Italian soldiers stepped apologetically
out of their aircraft and ships and waved

742
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,360
cheerfully but hesitantly to the people in
their doorways.

743
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:04,390
In the village, Pelagia and her father watched
the Italian units go by, their leaders consulting

744
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,300
maps with puzzled faces.

745
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,150
A line of men marched by, led by Captain Antonio
Corelli, with the mandolin that he had named

746
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,160
Antonia hanging on his back.

747
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,240
When he saw Pelagia he shouted, 'Bella bambina
eyes left!'

748
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:28,130
The heads of the soldiers turned in her direction,
and for one unbelievable minute Pelagia was

749
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,880
forced to watch the most ridiculous behaviour.

750
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:37,070
There was a soldier who crossed his eyes and
folded down his lower lip, another who pushed

751
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:43,330
his lips out and blew her a kiss, another
who pretended at each step to stumble over

752
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,820
his own feet.

753
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,960
Pelagia put her hand to her mouth.

754
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,470
'Don't laugh,' ordered the doctor.

755
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,500
'It's our duty to hate them.'

756
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:59,030
All over Cephallonia the islanders painted
rude remarks about the invaders in huge letters

757
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,610
on all available walls.

758
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,450
The men related Italian jokes.

759
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:07,210
What is the shortest book in the world?

760
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,150
The Italian Book of War Heroes.

761
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,680
Why do Italians wear moustaches?

762
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,160
To be reminded of their mothers.

763
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:22,390
A decision was made that the local population
should provide Italian officers with accommodation.

764
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:28,410
So one day the doctor came home and found
a round Italian officer standing in the kitchen.

765
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,870
'Buon giorno,' said the officer.

766
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,790
'Buon giorno,' the doctor replied.

767
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,730
'Perhaps you could tell me why you are here.'

768
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:44,950
'Ah,' said the man uncomfortably, 'I am sorry
to say, you are going to have to provide accommodation

769
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,270
for an officer.'

770
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,720
'Impossible,' said the doctor angrily.

771
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:57,340
Then an interesting thought occurred to him
and he asked, 'Do you have a supply of medicines?'

772
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,180
'Naturally,' replied the officer.

773
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:06,480
The two men exchanged glances, understanding
perfectly what the other was thinking.

774
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,160
'There are many things I need,' said the doctor.

775
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,460
'And I need accommodation.

776
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,460
So?'

777
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,840
'So it's a deal,' said the doctor.

778
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,380
'A deal,' repeated the officer.

779
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,780
'Anything you want, send me a message through
Captain Corelli.

780
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,780
You will find him charming.'

781
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:34,360
In the early evening Captain Corelli arrived,
driven by another soldier, Carlo Piero Guercio.

782
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:39,820
The captain looked around, appreciating the
signs of a quiet domestic life.

783
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:45,950
There was a goat tied to a tree, and a young
woman with dark eyes at a table, with a scarf

784
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:50,210
tied round her head and a large cooking knife
in her hand.

785
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:56,140
The captain fell to his knees before her and
exclaimed dramatically, 'Please don't kill

786
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,290
me, I am innocent.'

787
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:05,080
Pelagia smiled, against her will, and glanced
at Carlo, amazed to see that he was as big

788
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,540
as Velisarios.

789
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,840
The captain leapt up.

790
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:15,660
'I am Captain Antonio Corelli and this...'
he took Carlo by the arm, '... is one of our

791
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,660
heroes.

792
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,710
He rescued a fallen friend under fire.'

793
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:26,110
'It's nothing,' said Carlo with a shy smile,
and Pelagia knew immediately that, despite

794
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:29,900
his size, he was a soft and saddened man.

795
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,900
'This...'

796
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:36,270
Corelli continued, tapping a case in his hand,
'... is Antonia.

797
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,220
By what name do men know you, may I ask?'

798
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,500
Pelagia looked at Corelli properly for the
first time and realized that this was the

799
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:50,430
same officer who had commanded his men to
march past at 'eyes left'.

800
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:53,470
At the same moment Corelli recognized her.

801
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:58,490
'Ah,' he exclaimed and smacked himself on
the wrist, then fell to his knees once more

802
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:03,930
and said softly, 'Forgive me, I have sinned.'

803
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:08,870
Dr Iannis came out, saw the captain on his
knees and said, 'Captain Corelli?

804
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:12,700
I want a word with you.

805
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,700
Now.'

806
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,470
Surprised by the authority in the older man's
voice, Corelli stood up and held out his hand,

807
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:25,200
but the doctor did not put out his own, instead
saying sharply, 'I want an explanation please.

808
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,272
Why has the teaching of Greek history been
forbidden in schools?

809
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:33,280
And why is everyone being forced to learn
Italian?'

810
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,790
The captain felt himself wanting to run away
like a little boy.

811
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:41,020
'I am not responsible for it,' he said.

812
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,660
The doctor frowned fiercely and shook his
finger at the captain.

813
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,610
'There would be no wars, captain, if men like
you took more responsibility.'

814
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,590
'I must protest,' the captain replied weakly.

815
01:01:54,590 --> 01:02:01,210
'Fool,' said the doctor forcefully and returned
inside, very satisfied with himself.

816
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:04,090
Pelagia could not help feeling sorry for the
captain.

817
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,680
'Your father is...' he said, and the words
failed him.

818
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,350
'Yes, he is,' confirmed Pelagia.

819
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:17,230
'Where shall I sleep?' asked Corelli, eager
to change the subject.

820
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:21,430
'You will have my bed,' said Pelagia.

821
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:26,770
Under normal circumstances Antonio Corelli
would have asked brightly, 'Are we going to

822
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:27,870
share it then?

823
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:34,410
How kind,' but now, after the doctor's words,
he received this information with horror.

824
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,300
'Impossible,' he said.

825
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,590
'Tonight I shall sleep in the yard and tomorrow
I shall request alternative accommodation.'

826
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:47,130
Pelagia was shocked by the feelings of anxiety
that rose in her.

827
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:53,450
Could there be something inside her that wanted
this foreigner, this invader, to stay?

828
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,610
She went inside and told her father about
the captain's decision.

829
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,700
'He can't go,' he said.

830
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,380
'How am I supposed to be nasty to him if he
isn't here?

831
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,150
And anyway, he seems like a pleasant boy.'

832
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,550
He took his daughter's arm and went back out
with her.

833
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:14,550
'Young man,' he said to the captain, 'you
are staying here whether you like it or not.

834
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:19,080
It is quite possible that we will be sent
someone even worse.'

835
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,940
'Yes,' said the captain, overcome with embarrassment.

836
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:28,490
'Kyria Pelagia will bring water, some coffee
and food.

837
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:34,760
You will find we look after our guests, even
those who do not deserve it.

838
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,460
Your vast friend is welcome to join us.'

839
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:43,280
The captain went to call Carlo to the meal
in a state of miserable obedience and utter

840
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,470
defeat.

841
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:51,300
When the captain woke after his first night
in the doctor's house, he went into the kitchen,

842
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,340
saw Pelagia fast asleep and did not know what
to do.

843
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:01,520
He looked down upon her and realized he wanted
to crawl in beside her - nothing could have

844
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,710
seemed more natural - but instead he returned
to his room and took his mandolin, Antonia,

845
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,990
out of its case.

846
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:18,170
After practising for five minutes or so, he
began playing a very fast, complicated piece,

847
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:22,870
forgetful of the sleeping girl next door,
so that Pelagia woke to indescribably beautiful

848
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,700
music coming from somewhere in the house.

849
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:31,870
She lay listening, then went to dress in her
father's room, and Corelli, realizing that

850
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:35,070
she had risen at last, came out into the kitchen.

851
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,980
'That was lovely,' commented Pelagia.

852
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,080
He looked unhappy.

853
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,250
'I'm sorry, I woke you up.'

854
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,510
'That's very beautiful,' she said, gesturing
towards the instrument.

855
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,890
'Why do you play the mandolin?'

856
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,490
'Why does one do anything?

857
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:57,480
My uncle gave me Antonia and I discovered
I could be a good musician.

858
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,900
When the war's over, I'm going to become a
professional concert player and composer.'

859
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:06,760
'You're going to be rich and famous, then,'
Pelagia said jokingly.

860
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,580
'Why don't you play me something?'

861
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:15,370
The captain picked up the mandolin, and a
stream of notes poured from it that made Pelagia's

862
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,420
mouth fall open.

863
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,870
She had never before heard such complex, lovely
music.

864
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:27,400
She realized for the first time that music
was not just a sweet sound, but was, to those

865
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:35,060
who understood it, an emotional and intellectual
journey, a journey that she wanted to share.

866
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:40,040
She leaned forward and put her hands together
as if she were at prayer.

867
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:44,540
'There you are,' said the captain when he
had finished.

868
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:50,780
In her excitement at the music, she wanted
to dance and spin round, but she only said,

869
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:56,360
'I just don't understand why an artist like
you would descend to being a soldier.

870
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,510
It's a waste of time.'

871
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,030
'Of course it's a waste of time.'

872
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,620
He rose and glanced at his watch.

873
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,910
'Carlo should have been here by now.

874
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,820
I'll have to go and find him.'

875
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:14,580
He looked at her with one eyebrow raised and
said, 'By the way, Signorina, I couldn't help

876
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,790
noticing that you have a gun in the pocket
of your skirt.'

877
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:25,900
Pelagia began to tremble but the captain continued,
'I understand why you might want to have it,

878
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:31,570
and in fact I haven't seen it at all, but
you must realize what would happen if someone

879
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,010
else saw it.

880
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,360
Be more careful.'

881
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:41,030
She looked up at him, appealing with her eyes,
and he smiled, tapped the side of his nose

882
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:45,150
and was gone.

883
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:49,450
Carlo had not arrived with the car to pick
up Captain Corelli, because it had broken

884
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,810
down some kilometres from the village.

885
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:57,380
After kicking the car a number of times, Carlo
had set off on foot towards the village.

886
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:03,830
Velisarios passed him and the two men looked
at one another with something like recognition,

887
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:08,720
because both men had become accustomed to
the sad suspicion that they were unique in

888
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,880
a peculiar way.

889
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,080
They were both amazed at the other's size
and for a moment forgot that they were enemies.

890
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,610
'Hey!' said Velisarios, raising his hands
in a gesture of pleasure.

891
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:28,740
Carlo offered him one of his disgusting cigarettes,
Velisarios accepted, and they made sour faces

892
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:30,710
to each other as they smoked.

893
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:36,300
They then went their separate ways, more content
than before they had met.

894
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:42,640
As Carlo walked up the hill towards the house,
his mind turned towards Captain Corelli.

895
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,590
For the first time since the death of Francesco
in the mountains of Albania, the soldier was

896
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:54,170
experiencing a kind of happiness; in the captain
he had once again found a man whom he could

897
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,110
love and serve.

898
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:03,090
In his eyes, Corelli was endlessly optimistic,
a clear fountain, a kind of saint who remained

899
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:07,440
a man of honour because he knew no other way
to be.

900
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,490
Carlo knew that some people thought that Corelli
was a little mad, but for him, the captain

901
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:19,270
was a man who loved life so much that he did
not care what kind of an impression he made.

902
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:24,840
One of the pleasures of Carlo's life, at that
time, was an opera group called La Scala that

903
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:29,130
the captain had organized from among those
of his men who could sing.

904
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:34,220
Carlo, who had a fine singing voice, had been
invited to join when the captain had heard

905
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,270
him singing as he polished his boots.

906
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:42,359
There was another more unusual member of the
opera group, a young German soldier called

907
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:48,600
Gunter Weber, part of a troop of three thousand
German soldiers who had accompanied the Italian

908
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,380
army on their invasion of the island.

909
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:55,620
Although relations between the Germans and
Italians appeared friendly, the Germans thought

910
01:08:55,620 --> 01:09:01,150
of the Italians as inferior, and the Italians
were puzzled by German discipline and lack

911
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:02,160
of humour.

912
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:07,620
But Captain Corelli had made friends with
Gunter Weber, a boy who spoke some Italian

913
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:12,420
and whom the captain liked because his face
was open and friendly, and because when he

914
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,660
got drunk he laughed and lost his German seriousness.

915
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:23,110
Weber became a member of the opera club despite
the fact that he could not sing a note.

916
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:27,200
Neither Corelli nor Carlo knew that one day
the German would betray his friends with a

917
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:32,940
storm of bullets that would open red and bleeding
wounds in the bodies of the companions he

918
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:38,330
had grown to love.

919
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:41,310
CHAPTER SIX
The Freedom Fighter

920
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:49,009
After Captain Corelli had left, Pelagia did
some household tasks, then went outside to

921
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:53,670
brush her goat, thinking about the captain
as she did so.

922
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:54,670
Mandras caught her dreaming.

923
01:09:54,670 --> 01:10:00,860
He had climbed out of bed, cursing and completely
cured, on the day of the invasion, as if the

924
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:07,610
arrival of the Italians was something so important
that illness was a luxury to be left behind.

925
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:12,820
He had gone down to the sea and swum as if
he had never been away, and had returned with

926
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:17,150
a smile on his face and a fish for Pelagia.

927
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:24,280
But Pelagia only felt guilty now, whenever
she saw him, and deeply uncomfortable.

928
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,460
She jumped when he tapped her on the shoulder
and despite her effort to force a bright smile,

929
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:32,880
he did not fail to see the look of alarm in
her eyes.

930
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,080
He ignored it but would remember it later.

931
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,420
'I'm going to join the freedom fighters,'
he said.

932
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,700
'I'm leaving tomorrow.'

933
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,110
'Oh,' said Pelagia.

934
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:49,460
There was a long silence, then she said, 'I
won't be able to write.'

935
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,420
'I know.'

936
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:54,730
Pelagia shook her head slowly and sighed.

937
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:56,590
'Promise me one thing.

938
01:10:56,590 --> 01:11:02,850
Whenever you are planning to do something
terrible, think of me and don't do it.'

939
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:06,220
'I'm a Greek,' he said gently.

940
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,210
'Not a Fascist.

941
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,360
And I will think of you every minute.'

942
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,520
She heard the sincerity in his voice and felt
herself wanting to cry.

943
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,610
They embraced, like brother and sister, not
people who were engaged to be married.

944
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,300
'God go with you,' said Pelagia, and he smiled
sadly.

945
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,240
'And with you.'

946
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,090
'I shall always remember you swinging in the
tree.'

947
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:37,940
They laughed, then he looked at her lovingly
for one last moment, took a few steps, paused,

948
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:45,110
turned and said softly, 'I shall always love
you.'

949
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,110
***

950
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:50,030
Mandras joined a group of three men in the
hills of the Peloponnisos in southern Greece.

951
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:52,800
They had neither plan nor purpose.

952
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,281
All they knew was that they were driven by
something from the depths of the soul, something

953
01:11:57,281 --> 01:12:02,110
that commanded them to rid their land of strangers
or die in the attempt.

954
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:08,300
They set fire to lorries, and one of their
number stabbed an enemy soldier and afterwards

955
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:14,270
sat shaking with fear and disgust while the
others comforted and praised him.

956
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:18,710
They lived on the edge of a forest in a cave,
living off supplies brought by the priest

957
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,600
of a neighbouring village.

958
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,940
There were several other groups of freedom
fighters in the area, the most organized being

959
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:31,070
a Communist group known as ELAS (although
it did not declare itself as communist, preferring

960
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,200
to disguise the fact).

961
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,460
Mandras joined ELAS at first because he had
no choice.

962
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:42,250
He and his companions were lying in a small
leafy shelter that they had built, when they

963
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:47,060
were suddenly surrounded by ten men with thick
beards, pointing guns at them.

964
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:53,890
Their leader, who wore a dirty red cap, said,
'Come out,' and the men slowly stood up and

965
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:58,770
came out, fearing for their lives, their hands
upon the backs of their heads.

966
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,510
'Who are you with?'

967
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:03,040
demanded the man with the cap.

968
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,360
'With no one,' replied Mandras, confused.

969
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,920
'The deal is that either you go back to your
villages and leave us your weapons,' said

970
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:18,420
the leader commandingly, 'or you fight us
and we kill you, or you join us under my command.

971
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,240
This is my territory and no one else's.

972
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,360
Which is it?'

973
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,370
'We came to fight,' explained Mandras.

974
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:26,910
'Who are you?'

975
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:33,670
'I am Hector, not my real name, and we are
the local branch of ELAS.'

976
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:38,610
Hector's men grinned in a very friendly fashion,
and Mandras looked from one of his companions

977
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,000
to the others.

978
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,160
'We stay?' he asked, and they nodded.

979
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,710
They had been too long in the hills to give
up the fight and it was good to have found

980
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,480
a leader who might know what ought to be done.

981
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,210
'Good,' said Hector.

982
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:58,860
'Come with us, and let's see what you are
made of.'

983
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:03,780
He led Mandras and his companions three kilometres
to a tiny house guarded by one of Hector's

984
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,780
men.

985
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:10,020
'Bring him out,' Hector said, and the man
kicked and pushed a thin old man out into

986
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,920
the sunlight, where he stood trembling and
blinking.

987
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,650
Hector handed Mandras a length of knotted
rope and, pointing to the old man, said, 'Beat

988
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:21,650
him.'

989
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:26,090
Mandras stared at Hector in disbelief and
the latter stared fiercely back at him.

990
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:31,040
'If you want to be with us, you've got to
learn to teach these people a lesson.

991
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,360
This man has been found guilty.

992
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,310
Now beat him.'

993
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:41,420
Mandras struck the man once with the rope,
lightly, because of the man's age, and Hector

994
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:44,670
impatiently exclaimed, 'Harder, harder.

995
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:45,810
What are you?

996
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:47,530
A woman?'

997
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:51,580
Mandras struck the old man once more, a little
harder.

998
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,450
'Again,' commanded Hector.

999
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:56,820
It was easier each time he hit him.

1000
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:00,340
In fact it became a pleasure.

1001
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:05,540
It was as if all the anger from the earliest
years of his childhood rose in him and was

1002
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,790
given expression.

1003
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:15,490
The old man threw himself to the ground, screaming,
and Mandras suddenly knew he could be a god.

1004
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:20,360
Hector stepped forward, took the rope from
his hand, and placed a gun in his grasp.

1005
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,980
'Now kill him.'

1006
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:29,740
Mandras knelt down and placed the gun against
the old man's head, but he could not do it.

1007
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:35,000
He closed his eyes tight and told himself
that he had to be a man in front of other

1008
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
men.

1009
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,480
Anyway, he was only doing what Hector had
ordered him to do.

1010
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,690
The man was going to die anyway.

1011
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:49,840
Mandras tightened the muscles of his face
and shot the man in the head.

1012
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,090
Afterwards he looked not at the bloody mess
of bone and brain, but in disbelief at the

1013
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,000
smoking gun.

1014
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,380
Hector patted Mandras on the back and said,
'Well done'.

1015
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:07,500
Mandras tried to struggle to his feet but
could not do so, and Hector helped him up.

1016
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,270
'Revolutionary justice,' he said.

1017
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:13,490
'Historical necessity.'

1018
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:18,220
As they left the village, Mandras found that
he could not look anyone in the face and he

1019
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,160
stared down into the dirt.

1020
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,670
'What did he do?' he asked finally.

1021
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,370
'He was a dirty old thief.

1022
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:29,880
He took a bottle of whisky from supplies that
were meant for us.

1023
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,790
You have to be tough with these people or
they start doing what they like.

1024
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:39,550
They're full of the wrong ideas and it's just
something we have to get out of them.'

1025
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:40,550
***

1026
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:44,960
During his time with Hector, Mandras learnt
a great many things.

1027
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:50,410
Hector taught Mandras to read and write, and
taught him all about Communism.

1028
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:55,810
Mandras learnt that he was not a fisherman
but a worker, and that he was as good as Dr

1029
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:58,730
Iannis and deserved the same pay.

1030
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:04,190
He learnt to take food and animals from hungry
villagers without payment, since ELAS was

1031
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:08,590
working so hard on behalf of the Greek people.

1032
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:13,810
When villagers attempted to resist them, then
Hector and his men punished them, not just

1033
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:22,360
by shooting them but by tearing out eyes and
cutting mouths so that people died smiling.

1034
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,841
Hector explained to Mandras that the villagers
were Fascists and loyal to the king, and that

1035
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:32,360
a good lesson would help them to change their
ways.

1036
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:38,730
Mandras also learnt to rape women and to enjoy
their screams, since it was all in a good

1037
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:39,730
cause.

1038
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:45,760
A new and better Greece would be built, and
you did what you liked with the inferior bricks

1039
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,780
that were going to be thrown away anyway.

1040
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:53,840
It was like making an omelette and throwing
away the eggshells, said Hector, and Mandras

1041
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,810
drank in every word his leader said.

1042
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,540
CHAPTER SEVEN
A Problem with Eyes

1043
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:08,440
Pelagia treated the captain as badly as she
could.

1044
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:14,700
If she served him food, she would deliberately
spill it as she put it down, and eventually

1045
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:19,270
she noticed that he had acquired the habit
of not pulling in his chair until she had

1046
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,880
already put the food on the table.

1047
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:27,371
His failure to protest at her treatment of
him and his constant politeness made her even

1048
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,600
more annoyed.

1049
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:34,790
Her anger was so deep and so bitter that she
needed to shout at him or even strike him

1050
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,330
in order to release it.

1051
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:42,040
After two months of sleepless nights, months
during which she had done her best to annoy

1052
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,960
him, the captain remained calm and friendly.

1053
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,500
One day he left his gun on the table.

1054
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:55,710
After some thought, Pelagia decided to put
the gun in a bowl of water for a few minutes

1055
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:59,170
in the hope that this would do some damage.

1056
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:05,000
The captain came in and caught her just as
she was lifting the gun out of the water.

1057
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,220
She heard a voice behind her and, in her fear,
dropped it back in the bowl.

1058
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:15,310
'Oh God,' she exclaimed, 'you frightened me!'

1059
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:21,120
The captain looked down at the gun, raised
his eyebrows and said coolly, 'I see you're

1060
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,990
trying to make trouble for me.'

1061
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:30,870
This was not what she had expected, but nevertheless
her heart beat faster with fear and anxiety.

1062
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:34,720
'I was washing it,' she said weakly at last.

1063
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,250
'It was terribly oily.'

1064
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:42,340
'How charming to know so little about guns,'
said the captain.

1065
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:48,590
Pelagia went red, strangely angered by his
suggestion, which she knew he did not mean,

1066
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:52,830
that she was a sweet and silly girl who did
stupid things.

1067
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:56,990
'You are not a good liar,' the captain added.

1068
01:19:56,990 --> 01:19:58,910
'What do you expect?'

1069
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,980
she demanded, immediately wondering what she
had meant.

1070
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:05,500
The captain seemed to know, however.

1071
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:10,190
'It must be very difficult for you all to
have to put up with us.'

1072
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:15,190
He removed the gun from the bowl, sighed and
said, 'I suppose you have done me a favour.

1073
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,350
It does need cleaning.'

1074
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,060
'Aren't you angry, then?

1075
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,770
Why aren't you angry?'

1076
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,400
'What's anger got to do with music?

1077
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,320
Do you really believe I've got nothing important
to think about?

1078
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,580
Let's just think about important things and
leave one another in peace.

1079
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:38,860
I'll leave you alone and you can leave me
alone.'

1080
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:43,250
This idea struck Pelagia as new and unacceptable.

1081
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:48,540
She did not want to leave him alone, she wanted
to shout at him and hit him.

1082
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:53,440
Suddenly overcome with emotion, she struck
him with all her force, right across the left

1083
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,560
cheek.

1084
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,250
He tried to step back in time, but was too
late.

1085
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:04,330
He steadied himself and touched a hand to
his face, as if comforting himself, then held

1086
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,500
out the gun.

1087
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:11,850
'Put it back in the water,' he said, 'I might
find it less painful.'

1088
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:15,090
This remark made Pelagia even angrier.

1089
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:20,110
She rushed out into the yard and kicked an
iron pot, injuring her toe, then threw the

1090
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:22,060
pot over the wall.

1091
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:27,350
The captain, watching her from the window,
shook his head in amazement.

1092
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:34,020
These Greek girls, such passion and fire,
he thought admiringly, and then wondered why

1093
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,920
no one had ever written an opera set in modern
Greece.

1094
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,480
A tune entered his mind and he began to sing
it softly to himself, thinking that perhaps

1095
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,540
he would call it 'Pelagia's March'.

1096
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:53,600
As the months went by, Pelagia noticed that
she was losing her anger, and this puzzled

1097
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,520
and upset her.

1098
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,460
The fact was that the captain had become as
much a part of the house as the goat or her

1099
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:06,180
own father, and she was quite used to seeing
him playing with little Lemoni in the yard,

1100
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:11,610
or seated at the table, deep in concentration,
composing music for the mandolin.

1101
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:16,800
Early in the morning she looked forward with
pleasure to the moment when he would enter

1102
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,890
the kitchen and say, 'Kalimcra Kyria Pelagia.

1103
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:26,220
Is Carlo here yet?' and in the evening she
would actually begin to worry if he were a

1104
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,720
little late.

1105
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:33,739
A new source of anger developed, the problem
being that this time the anger was directed

1106
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,590
against herself.

1107
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:41,750
It seemed that she just could not help looking
at him, and he was always catching her.

1108
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:46,610
There was something about him, sitting at
the table as he went through his paperwork,

1109
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,810
that made her look up at him regularly.

1110
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:55,150
But every time she looked up, he did too,
and she would be caught in his steady gaze

1111
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:59,360
as surely as if he had grasped her by the
wrists.

1112
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:05,520
For a few seconds they would look at one another
and then she would grow red and look down.

1113
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:12,820
Then a few seconds later she would look up,
and at that moment he would return her glance.

1114
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,380
It was impossible and embarrassing.

1115
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:21,820
'I've got to stop doing this,' she would tell
herself and, certain that he was deep in his

1116
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:25,670
tasks, would look up and get caught again.

1117
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:31,150
She knew he was playing a game with her, that
she was being played with so gently that it

1118
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,960
was impossible to protest.

1119
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:40,560
After all, she had never caught him looking
at her, so it was all her fault, obviously.

1120
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:47,440
Nevertheless, it was a game of which he was
in absolute command, and in that sense she

1121
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,400
was its victim.

1122
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,400
She decided that she would not be the one
to look down; she would wait until he broke

1123
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,720
away.

1124
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,480
She searched for every last bit of courage
and looked up.

1125
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,480
They looked at one another for what seemed
like hours and Pelagia wondered foolishly

1126
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,210
if it was considered acceptable to blink.

1127
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:15,310
Her eyes began to water and she started seeing
two captains instead of one.

1128
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:21,630
He did not look away but began to make funny
faces, showing his teeth like a horse, and

1129
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:27,600
moving the tip of his nose from side to side,
so that Pelagia began a smile, then laughed

1130
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,170
aloud and blinked.

1131
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,810
Corelli jumped to his feet, crying, 'I won!

1132
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:38,680
I won,' and the doctor looked up from his
book, exclaiming, 'What?

1133
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,680
What?'

1134
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,360
'You cheated,' protested Pelagia, laughing.

1135
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:49,480
The doctor looked from the captain to his
daughter, adjusted his glasses and sighed.

1136
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:56,880
'Whatever next?' he demanded, knowing perfectly
well what was next, and working out in advance

1137
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,290
how to deal with it.

1138
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:04,250
Some days later they passed each other at
the door, she going out and he returning from

1139
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,710
work.

1140
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:11,620
Unselfconsciously, she raised one hand to
his left cheek and, in passing, kissed him

1141
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,440
on the other.

1142
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:20,140
He was astonished and, by the time she reached
the entrance to the yard, so was she, because

1143
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:24,580
it was not until then that she realized what
she had done.

1144
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:29,560
She stopped as if she had walked straight
into a wall, felt her blood rising to the

1145
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:34,390
roots of her hair, and realized that she did
not dare look back at him.

1146
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:38,710
He called out, as she knew he would, 'Kyria
Pelagia,'

1147
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,680
'What?' she demanded.

1148
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,200
'What's for dinner?'

1149
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,440
'Don't laugh at me.

1150
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,540
I thought you were my father.

1151
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:49,840
I always kiss him like that when he comes
in.'

1152
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,710
'Very understandable.

1153
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:54,600
We are both old and small.'

1154
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,770
'If you are going to laugh at me, I shall
never speak to you again.'

1155
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:02,730
He came out and threw himself upon his knees
before her.

1156
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,550
'Oh no,' he cried, 'not that.

1157
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:10,450
Shoot me, beat me, but don't say you'll never
speak to me.'

1158
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:13,910
He grasped her round the knees and pretended
to weep.

1159
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,170
'The whole village is looking,' she protested.

1160
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,440
'Stop it at once.'

1161
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:25,250
'My heart is broken,' he cried and, taking
her hand, he began to cover it with kisses.

1162
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:27,730
'Stupid goat, you are insane.'

1163
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:31,010
Corelli laughed and got to his feet.

1164
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:37,150
'Come inside,' he said, 'I've got something
very interesting to show you.'

1165
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:43,520
Relieved by this sudden change of subject,
she followed him through the door, but found

1166
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,630
that he was passing her on the way out again.

1167
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:52,940
He put his hands on each side of her head,
kissed her dramatically on the forehead, exclaimed,

1168
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:58,370
'I'm sorry, I thought it was the doctor,'
and then ran away across the yard and down

1169
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,920
the street.

1170
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:09,900
She stared after him in amazement, making
every effort not to laugh or smile.

1171
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,700
CHAPTER EIGHT
Snails

1172
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,870
When the doctor glanced out of the window
and saw Captain Corelli creeping up behind

1173
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:24,750
Lemoni in order to surprise her, he laid down
his pen and went out into the afternoon sunlight.

1174
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:32,030
'Excuse me, children,' said the doctor, ignoring
the captain's embarrassment, 'Lemoni, do you

1175
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:36,739
remember that you told me you know a place
where there were lots of snails?

1176
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:40,239
Can you come round this evening and show me
where they are?'

1177
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,590
Lemoni nodded importantly.

1178
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,750
'What's all this about?' asked the captain.

1179
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:52,820
Stiffly, the doctor said, 'Thanks to you Italians,
there's almost no food.

1180
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,260
We're going out this evening to find snails.'

1181
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:02,530
The captain wiped the sweat from his forehead
and said, 'Permit me to come and help.'

1182
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:09,080
So in the evening, an hour before sunset,
Pelagia and her father, Lemoni and the captain

1183
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:14,530
climbed over a low wall and then began crawling
through impossibly thick undergrowth in their

1184
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:17,140
search for snails.

1185
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:21,880
It became immediately apparent that there
were quantities of snails everywhere they

1186
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,950
looked.

1187
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:28,470
The child and three adults became so involved
in their task that they did not notice they

1188
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,470
had become separated.

1189
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:35,840
The captain found himself on his own and paused
for a second, realizing that he could not

1190
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,130
remember ever having felt so content.

1191
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:46,260
'Oh, oh no,' came Pelagia's voice from nearby.

1192
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,380
Fearing that perhaps she had been hurt, the
captain crawled towards the place where her

1193
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:56,800
voice had come from and found her unable to
move, her hair caught in some briars, her

1194
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,760
neck pulled backwards.

1195
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,940
'Don't laugh,' she said crossly.

1196
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:04,590
'I'm not laughing,' he said, laughing.

1197
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,260
'I was afraid you were hurt.'

1198
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,910
'If you don't help me, I'll murder you.

1199
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:11,660
Just stop laughing.'

1200
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:17,470
'Hold still,' he told her, and reaching over
her shoulders he began to pull the hair out

1201
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,460
piece by piece, as gently as he could.

1202
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:26,920
'I've done it,' he said, pleased with himself,
and as he drew back and his lips passed her

1203
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:31,820
cheek, he kissed it tenderly, before the ear.

1204
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:37,510
She touched her fingertips to the place of
the kiss, and said, shaking her head at him,

1205
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:40,320
'You shouldn't have done that.'

1206
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,380
He knelt back and held her gaze with his own.

1207
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,110
'I couldn't help it.

1208
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,570
I'm sorry.'

1209
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:52,860
They looked at one another for a long moment,
and then Pelagia began to cry.

1210
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:58,430
'What's the matter?' asked Corelli, frowning
in concern as Pelagia's tears rolled down

1211
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:01,570
her cheeks and fell into the bucket among
the snails.

1212
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:04,960
'You're drowning them,' he said, pointing.

1213
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,800
'What's the matter?'

1214
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,570
She gave a sad smile, and started crying again.

1215
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:16,700
He took her in his arms and patted her back.

1216
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:23,110
Suddenly she said, 'I can't stand it any more,
not any of it.

1217
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:24,670
I'm sorry.'

1218
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:31,739
'Everything is horrible,' agreed the captain,
wondering if he too might start to cry.

1219
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:37,130
He took her head gently in his hands and touched
at the tears with his lips.

1220
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:42,730
She gazed at him wonderingly and suddenly
they found themselves underneath the briars,

1221
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:50,920
in the sunset, surrounded by escaping snails,
deep in their first, secret, guilty kiss.

1222
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:57,690
Hungry and desperate, filled with light, they
could not move away from each other, and when

1223
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:03,420
finally they returned home, they brought back
fewer snails together than Lemoni brought

1224
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,130
on her own.

1225
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:10,040
They became lovers in the old-fashioned sense.

1226
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:16,720
Their idea of making love was to kiss in the
dark under the trees or sit on a rock watching

1227
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,260
the sea.

1228
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:25,480
He loved her too much to risk her unhappiness,
and she had too much sense to take risks.

1229
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:30,770
Again and again she had seen the tragedy of
girls with an unwanted child and the poisoned

1230
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:35,620
deaths of girls who had tried to end their
pregnancies.

1231
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:40,930
It was hard for Pelagia to love an invader
and sometimes she shouted at Corelli, her

1232
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:46,060
eyes filled with tears of anger: 'How can
you bear to be here?

1233
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,060
Orders?

1234
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,620
Orders from a madman!

1235
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,220
Don't you know you're being used?

1236
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,650
Why don't you take your guns and leave?

1237
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:55,560
Don't you know who the enemy is?'

1238
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:02,050
At these times the captain listened silently
and bowed his head, the bitterness of his

1239
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,780
shame eating like a worm at the muscles of
his heart.

1240
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:08,660
But they could not stop themselves from loving
one another.

1241
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:14,200
Gunter Weber managed to obtain a motorcycle
for the captain, who turned up outside the

1242
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:17,430
doctor's house one day wearing a cap and goggles.

1243
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:21,590
'Do you want to come for a ride?' he asked.

1244
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,640
Pelagia crossed her arms.

1245
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,280
'I've never been on one.

1246
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,840
In fact I've never been in a car either and
I'm not starting now.'

1247
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,880
'I've never been on one either,' he said,
'but it's very easy.'

1248
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,300
'Somebody might see us,' said Pelagia.

1249
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:42,930
The captain solved this problem by bringing
Pelagia a disguise consisting of a cap, goggles

1250
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:48,450
and a long leather coat, and the next day
they met around the bend of the road and rode

1251
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,820
off on the bike.

1252
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:57,300
They fell off twice, without injury, and she
gripped his waist, whitefaced with terror.

1253
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:03,630
She climbed off, shaking, and realized she
could not wait to get back on; it was splendid

1254
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:06,760
to ride a motorcycle.

1255
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:11,820
They went to places where Pelagia could not
have been recognized and to places that were

1256
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:17,050
deserted, and there she would put her arm
through his and walk beside him, leaning her

1257
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,760
weight against his shoulder, always laughing.

1258
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,130
With him, she would always remember that she
laughed.

1259
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:30,220
One day they discovered a ruined hut so old
that the floor had sunk into the earth.

1260
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:35,770
They called it 'Casa Nostra', and in this
secret house they would spread a blanket and

1261
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,430
lie embracing and talking.

1262
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:42,290
All their lovers' talk began with the phrase,
'After the war'.

1263
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:48,640
'After the war, when we are married, let's
go to America; I've got relatives in Chicago.

1264
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:53,470
After the war we won't bring up our children
with any religion, they can make their own

1265
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,330
minds up when they're older.

1266
01:33:55,330 --> 01:34:00,780
After the war, we'll go all over Europe and
you can give concerts in hotels and that's

1267
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,760
how we'll live.

1268
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:09,880
After the war I'll love you, I'll love you
forever after the war.'

1269
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:10,880
***

1270
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,920
It was during this period of happiness for
Pelagia and the captain that Dr Iannis was

1271
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:18,830
woken one night by a gentle tapping on his
window.

1272
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:25,500
Puzzled, the doctor looked out and saw a villager
accompanied by a very tall fair-haired man

1273
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:30,890
wearing the Greek national costume, something
that a wealthy man might wear once a year

1274
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,610
on a feast day.

1275
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:39,090
'We thought you were the man to help him,'
the villager told the doctor, before departing.

1276
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:45,460
The tall stranger smiled and held out his
hand, speaking in an extraordinarily old-fashioned

1277
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:50,220
Greek that the doctor found almost impossible
to understand.

1278
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:55,710
The stranger then climbed, uninvited, through
the doctor's window into the house, and took

1279
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:58,489
a huge radio out of his bag.

1280
01:34:58,489 --> 01:35:04,740
Pelagia woke and came into her father's room,
saw the stranger and put her hand over her

1281
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,330
mouth, wide-eyed with amazement.

1282
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:08,690
'Who's this?'

1283
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,239
she demanded of her father.

1284
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:13,660
'How am I supposed to know,' replied the doctor.

1285
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:20,000
'He says he's called Bunnios and he talks
Greek like a Spanish cow.'

1286
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:27,420
The stranger bowed politely and shook Pelagia's
hand, then smiled charmingly and said, 'Greek

1287
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,230
of the old days.

1288
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,230
Homer.'

1289
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,970
'Ancient Greek?'

1290
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:34,719
exclaimed Pelagia, disbelievingly.

1291
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,370
The doctor tapped his finger to his forehead.

1292
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,850
'English?' he asked.

1293
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,500
'English,' agreed the man.

1294
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
'But, I must beg you...'

1295
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,420
'Of course we won't tell anyone.'

1296
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:48,510
The man smiled.

1297
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:53,990
It had been an awful burden to speak the finest
ancient Greek and not be understood.

1298
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:59,950
'We are having an Italian officer sleeping
in a room,' said the doctor, whose English

1299
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:05,100
was not as good as he liked to believe, 'so
we are being very quiet, please.

1300
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,290
Are you a spy?'

1301
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:11,550
The man nodded and asked, 'Do you have any
clothes I could have?

1302
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:14,380
I would be so grateful.'

1303
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:19,320
The Englishman departed for the town of Argostoli
at dawn, wearing trousers that ended half

1304
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:26,280
way down his legs, and having received some
good advice from the doctor: 'Look, OK?

1305
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,050
You accent terrible-terrible.

1306
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:31,860
Not to talk, understand?

1307
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,060
You are quiet until you learning.

1308
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:38,400
Also, you watch out Communists - they thieves.

1309
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,780
Italians OK, Germans not good, see?'

1310
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:49,020
Bunnios, whose real name was Bunny Warren,
soon found an empty hut in the hills where,

1311
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:54,860
using his huge radio, he reported in great
detail to his British masters, informing them

1312
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:57,470
of troop movements in the area.

1313
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:03,430
He also set himself the task of learning modern
Greek, and was assisted in this by the willing

1314
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:05,780
islanders.

1315
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:06,780
***

1316
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:11,110
The captain's opera group, La Scala, became
accustomed to meeting in the doctor's house.

1317
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:16,040
'Your soldiers are stealing from people's
vegetable patches, when we're dying of hunger

1318
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:19,840
already,' said the doctor to Corelli one day,
when the group was there.

1319
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:26,130
'If it's true, they will be punished,' the
captain replied, already deeply shamed and

1320
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:32,280
embarrassed by the fact that some nights previously
someone, obviously an Italian soldier, had

1321
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,340
stolen Pelagia's goat.

1322
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:40,110
'We Germans do not do this,' said Gunter Weber,
with a pleased expression on his face.

1323
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:46,590
'Germans can't sing,' replied Corelli, 'and
anyway, I'll get this investigated and I'll

1324
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:48,020
put a stop to it.

1325
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,880
It's too bad.'

1326
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,120
Weber smiled.

1327
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,940
'You are very famous for defending the rights
of the Greeks.

1328
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,660
I wonder if sometimes you understand why you
are here.'

1329
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:01,550
'I try to think of it as a holiday.

1330
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,900
I don't have your advantages, Gunter.'

1331
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:05,960
'Advantages?'

1332
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,030
'Yes.

1333
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:11,880
I don't have the advantage of thinking that
other races are inferior to mine.'

1334
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,090
'It's a question of science,' said Weber.

1335
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:18,630
'You can't alter a scientific fact.'

1336
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:20,160
Corelli frowned.

1337
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,430
'Science?

1338
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:23,670
I don't care about science.

1339
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:26,400
Moral principles are important, not science.'

1340
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,250
'We disagree,' said Weber in a friendly fashion.

1341
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,750
'Science tells us that the strong survive.

1342
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:37,650
Strength needs no excuses and doesn't have
to give reasons.'

1343
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:43,800
'Science is about facts, and morality is about
values,' said Carlo, who had been listening

1344
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,800
closely.

1345
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:49,330
'It's also a matter of being able to live
with yourself,' Corelli added.

1346
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:53,540
'You're a good man,' said Gunter, 'I admit
it.

1347
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:59,970
Why don't I get my record player from my car
and we can all sing with Marlene Dietrich.'

1348
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:04,480
He went to his car and proudly returned with
the record player, which he put down on the

1349
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,800
table.

1350
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:12,239
He put on the record and Dietrich began to
sing, her voice full of the sadness of knowledge,

1351
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,180
the longing for love.

1352
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:23,760
'Oh,' exclaimed Weber, 'her voice makes me
melt,' and Corelli said, 'Antonia likes this.

1353
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,650
She's going to sing.'

1354
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:31,170
He began to accompany the song, playing so
beautifully that in the village people stopped

1355
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:34,770
what they were doing and listened to Corelli
fill the night.

1356
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:41,190
Pelagia left the kitchen, her form ghostlike
in the light of the candles.

1357
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:44,660
'Please play that song again,' she asked Weber.

1358
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,350
'It was so beautiful.'

1359
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:50,000
'Do you like it?' asked Weber, and she nodded.

1360
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:56,150
'All right,' he continued, 'when I go home
after the war, I'll leave it with you.

1361
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:59,170
It would please me very much for you to have
it.'

1362
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:01,600
Pelagia was delighted.

1363
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:06,330
She looked at the smiling boy with his smart
uniform and blond hair and was filled with

1364
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,330
pleasure.

1365
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:12,880
'You're so sweet,' she said, and kissed him
naturally on the cheek, so that the boys of

1366
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:19,130
La Scala cheered and Weber went red and hid
his eyes with his hand.

1367
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:20,130
***

1368
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:24,670
The time came when the doctor decided that
it was necessary to discuss certain matters

1369
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:26,050
with Pelagia.

1370
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:29,660
'There's something I have to talk to you about,'
he told her.

1371
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:35,980
'It has not escaped my notice that you have
fallen in love with the captain.'

1372
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:39,790
She went violently red and looked terribly
shocked.

1373
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:41,510
'The captain?'

1374
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:43,770
she said foolishly.

1375
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:46,500
He began a long speech.

1376
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,700
'It's not that I don't like the captain.

1377
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:54,800
Of course, he's a little mad, which is quite
simply explained by the fact that he is Italian.

1378
01:40:54,800 --> 01:41:01,260
In fact I like him very much, but you must
remember that you are engaged to Mandras,

1379
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,590
and technically, the captain is an enemy.

1380
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:09,110
Can you imagine the pain you will suffer when
people discover that you have given up the

1381
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:12,010
love of a Greek in favour of an invader?

1382
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:16,031
People will throw stones at you and spit,
you know that, don't you?

1383
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:21,550
You would have to move away to Italy if you
wanted to stay with him, because here you

1384
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,030
might not be safe.

1385
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:26,780
Are you prepared to leave this island and
this people?

1386
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,880
'And another thing.

1387
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,460
Love is a temporary madness.

1388
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:35,750
When it ends you have to work out whether
your roots have so joined together that it

1389
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:39,770
is unimaginable that you should ever separate.

1390
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:42,480
Because that is what love is.

1391
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:49,640
Love isn't breathlessness, it is not excitement,
it is not lying awake at night imagining that

1392
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,960
he is kissing every part of your body.

1393
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:56,100
No, don't look so embarrassed, I'm telling
you some truths.

1394
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:00,650
That is just being "in love", which any fool
can do.

1395
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:06,350
Love itself is what is left over when being
in love has burned away.

1396
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:12,990
'I say to you that to marry the captain is
impossible until our country is free again.

1397
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:19,260
I would be happy for you to do this, but this
means that you have a love that will be delayed.

1398
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:25,870
Pelagia, you know as well as I do that love
delayed means that physical passion increases.

1399
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:28,560
No, don't look at me like that.

1400
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:33,900
Do you think I don't know that young girls
can be eaten by desire?

1401
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,860
Imagine if you got pregnant, what would you
do?

1402
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:39,780
I would not assist in the murder of an innocent.

1403
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:44,610
Would you have the child, and then find that
no man would ever marry you?

1404
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:49,820
I would not abandon you as long as I live,
even under such circumstances.

1405
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,900
But imagine if I should die.

1406
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,020
What then?'

1407
01:42:54,020 --> 01:43:00,550
Pelagia had never felt so crushed in all her
life and wept bitterly, but when she looked

1408
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:04,160
up, she found her father looking at her sympathetically.

1409
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,730
'You make everything sound so disgusting,'
she said.

1410
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:10,050
'You don't know how it is.'

1411
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:13,520
'I went through a lot of this with your mother,'
he replied.

1412
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,110
'She was engaged to someone else.

1413
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:18,900
I do know how it is.'

1414
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,900
'You don't forbid everything then?'

1415
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,760
she asked hopefully.

1416
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,810
'No, I don't forbid everything.

1417
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:31,760
I say you must be careful and act honourably
to Mandras.

1418
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,390
Don't give in to your desires, that's all.

1419
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:36,510
The captain is a good man.

1420
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:41,140
Pray for our freedom, Pelagia, because then
everything becomes possible.'

1421
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:48,219
Pelagia stood up to go and her father said,
'I did not intend to upset you.

1422
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:51,300
I was young once.'

1423
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:56,180
'Not everything was different in your day,
then,' she said as she left the room, and

1424
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:03,219
her father smiled, pleased that his words
had not crushed his daughter's spirit.

1425
01:44:03,219 --> 01:44:04,219
***

1426
01:44:04,219 --> 01:44:07,450
The doctor and the captain were sitting indoors
at the kitchen table while the latter was

1427
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:10,600
removing a broken string from his mandolin.

1428
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:17,000
The doctor leaned back and sighed, then suddenly
asked, 'Are you and Pelagia planning to be

1429
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
married?

1430
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,310
As her father, I think I have a right to know.'

1431
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:26,530
The captain was so surprised by the frankness
of the question that he was unable to think

1432
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:28,410
of a reply.

1433
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:33,510
His relationship with Pelagia had only been
able to proceed on the basis that no one ever

1434
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:36,630
brought the issue out into the open.

1435
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:38,190
He looked at the doctor anxiously.

1436
01:44:38,190 --> 01:44:42,250
'You can't live here,' said the doctor.

1437
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,750
He pointed to the mandolin.

1438
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:48,800
'If you want to be a musician, this is the
last place to be.

1439
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,590
And I don't think that Pelagia could live
in Italy.

1440
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:52,910
She is a Greek.

1441
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:55,390
She would die like a flower without sunlight.'

1442
01:44:55,390 --> 01:45:01,410
'Ah,' said the captain, for the lack of any
intelligent remark.

1443
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,910
'It's true,' said the doctor.

1444
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:07,030
'I know you have not thought about it.

1445
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:09,440
Italians always act without thinking.

1446
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:13,610
Anyway, Pelagia is a Greek, that's my point.

1447
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:16,219
So can it work?'

1448
01:45:16,219 --> 01:45:18,540
There was a silence between the two men.

1449
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:25,719
'I love her,' said Corelli at last, as if
this were the answer to the problem, which

1450
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,260
to him it was.

1451
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,040
'I know that.

1452
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,890
You'd have to live here, that's all,' said
the doctor.

1453
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:37,989
'You might have to choose between loving her
and becoming a musician.'

1454
01:45:37,989 --> 01:45:43,880
The doctor left the room, more for dramatic
effect than for any other purpose, and then

1455
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,120
came back in.

1456
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:47,110
'And another thing.

1457
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:53,460
This is a very ancient land and we've had
nothing except murder for two thousand years.

1458
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:59,219
We've got so many places full of bitter ghosts
that anyone who goes near them or lives in

1459
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:03,020
them becomes heartless or insane.

1460
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:07,900
I don't believe in God, captain, but I do
believe in ghosts.

1461
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,700
And there will be many more deaths.

1462
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:12,500
It's only a question of time.

1463
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:18,170
So don't make any plans.'

1464
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:24,660
CHAPTER NINE
Autumn 1943: Betrayal

1465
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:30,800
The Allies invaded Sicily, Italy's southern
island, and so they betrayed their most loyal

1466
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,989
and courageous friend, Greece, and did not
come to its aid.

1467
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:41,450
The angry Greeks demanded to know why their
country, which was occupied by the Italians,

1468
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:44,900
had been ignored, and received no answers.

1469
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:50,890
The Allies had abandoned Greece, the little
nation that had given Europe its culture and

1470
01:46:50,890 --> 01:46:52,330
its heart.

1471
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:58,020
To make matters worse, during this period
the Greek Communists were committing unimaginably

1472
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:04,910
vicious acts, but for a long time the world
did not believe it.

1473
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:09,700
On Cephallonia, the Italian soldiers listened
to their radios and followed the course of

1474
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:14,660
Allied progress up Italy, their homeland,
while the German soldiers were angered and

1475
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:19,170
disgusted by the Italian army's lack of resistance
to the Allies.

1476
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:25,300
Corelli and his brother officers sensed ice
in the air, and visits between the Germans

1477
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,280
and the Italians became less frequent.

1478
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:34,660
When Weber turned up at meetings of La Scala,
he seemed quiet and distant.

1479
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:41,520
'What happens,' Corelli asked Pelagia with
a troubled look, 'when we have to surrender

1480
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,060
before the Germans do?'

1481
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:45,190
'We'll get married.'

1482
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:47,000
He shook his head sadly.

1483
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
'It's going to be a complete mess.

1484
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,840
There's no chance of the British coming.

1485
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,270
They're going straight for Rome.

1486
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:57,820
No one will save us unless we save ourselves.

1487
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:02,500
We should attack the Germans on the island
now, while there aren't many of them, but

1488
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,510
our generals don't do anything.

1489
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:08,220
They say we should trust the Germans.'

1490
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,290
'Don't you trust them?'

1491
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:12,230
'I'm not stupid.'

1492
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:16,020
'Come inside,' she said, 'my father's out.'

1493
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,600
'There's no point.

1494
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:23,380
My mind is just a blank that's filled with
worry.'

1495
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:28,660
Corelli came to the doctor's house less often,
and day and night he trained his men, working

1496
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:34,450
them hard in the terrible August heat, so
that the sweat ran down their faces and arms,

1497
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:37,530
and the sun burned the flesh of their shoulders.

1498
01:48:37,530 --> 01:48:39,500
They did not complain.

1499
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:44,239
They knew that the captain was right to prepare
them.

1500
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:49,800
He himself stopped playing the mandolin; there
was so little time for it that when he picked

1501
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:55,080
it up it felt foreign in his fingers in comparison
with a gun.

1502
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:00,170
He went home to Pelagia on his motorbike at
times when her father was likely to be out,

1503
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:05,610
and he brought her bread, honey, bottles of
wine, a photograph signed on the back with

1504
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:11,830
the words 'After the War...' written on it
in his elegant, foreign-looking handwriting,

1505
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:16,160
and he brought her his tired, grey face, and
his saddened eyes.

1506
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:23,110
'My poor darling,' she would say, her arms
about his neck, 'don't worry, don't worry,

1507
01:49:23,110 --> 01:49:29,719
don't worry,' and he would move back a little
and say, 'Koritsimou, let me just look at

1508
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:31,560
you.'

1509
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:36,810
And then came the time when Carlo was listening
to the radio, trying to find a signal.

1510
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:43,480
It was 8 September, and the evenings had become
much cooler than they had been before.

1511
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:49,620
Carlo had recently been thinking about Francesco
and about the horror of Albania, and now more

1512
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:55,100
than ever he knew that it had all been a waste,
and that his time in Cephallonia had been

1513
01:49:55,100 --> 01:50:02,010
a holiday from a war that was going to destroy
his life once more, perhaps forever.

1514
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:07,890
He found a voice and turned up the volume:
'... all aggressive acts by Italian Armed

1515
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:15,030
Forces against the forces of the British and
the Americans will cease at once, everywhere.'

1516
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:18,810
The Italians had formally surrendered to the
Allies.

1517
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:24,940
Outside, the bells of the island began to
ring; they rang all over the island in the

1518
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:30,790
towns of Argostoli, Lixouri, Soulari, Dorizata.

1519
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:36,719
On the radio there was a message from Eisenhower,
the American president: '... All Italians

1520
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:42,230
who take steps to rid themselves of the German
presence in their country will have the assistance

1521
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:45,800
and support of the Allies...'

1522
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:51,690
Carlo ran out and found Corelli just arriving
on his bike, a great cloud of blue smoke behind

1523
01:50:51,690 --> 01:50:52,900
him.

1524
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:59,890
'Antonio, Antonio, it's all over, and the
Allies have promised to help us,' he cried.

1525
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:05,560
He threw his enormous arms around the man
he loved and picked him up, dancing in a circle.

1526
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:09,910
'Carlo, Carlo,' the captain cried, 'put me
down.

1527
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:11,400
Don't get so excited.

1528
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,620
The Allies don't care about us.

1529
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,880
We're in Greece, remember.

1530
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,880
Carlo, you don't know your own strength.

1531
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,480
You half killed me.'

1532
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:25,670
'They'll help us,' said Carlo, but Corelli
shook his head.

1533
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:28,820
'If we don't act now, we're finished.

1534
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:34,070
We've got to get the Germans on the island
to surrender to us.'

1535
01:51:34,070 --> 01:51:39,610
That night the Italian warships in the harbours
of the island sailed for home, without informing

1536
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:44,500
anyone they were going, or taking with them
a single Italian soldier.

1537
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:50,110
In a terrible act of cowardice, the warships
withdrew their protection from the soldiers

1538
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:57,140
on the island, so that the German soldiers
laughed and Corelli's men smelled betrayal.

1539
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:03,610
Corelli waited at the telephone for orders,
and when none came he fell asleep in his chair.

1540
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:10,340
Carlo, now realizing that Corelli's pessimistic
predictions were probably correct, wrote his

1541
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:16,370
captain a long letter in which he declared
his undying love for him and also his unselfish

1542
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:21,590
hope that Corelli would find true happiness
with Pelagia.

1543
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:26,350
Strangely convinced that he was going to die
soon, Carlo added this letter to his other

1544
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:31,120
writings and brought them to the doctor's
house, with the request that his papers should

1545
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:36,660
be placed in the hiding-hole under the trapdoor
and only opened and read in the event of his

1546
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,370
death.

1547
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:44,560
Like Corelli, Gunter Weber also slept from
time to time in his chair, waiting for orders,

1548
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,990
desperately tired and with all his confidence
gone.

1549
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:55,190
He missed his Italian friends, but worse than
that, his country was losing and he no longer

1550
01:52:55,190 --> 01:52:58,030
felt proud and full of strength.

1551
01:52:58,030 --> 01:53:03,860
He felt inferior and so betrayed by his country's
allies, the Italians, that if he had been

1552
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,960
a woman he would have wept.

1553
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:12,489
He tried to pray but the words turned bitter
in his mouth.

1554
01:53:12,489 --> 01:53:17,400
Corelli stopped his motorcycle on his way
back to camp and beneath the shade of a tree,

1555
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:24,449
by a ruined wall, he sat and thought about
going back to Italy, about surviving, about

1556
01:53:24,449 --> 01:53:26,830
Pelagia.

1557
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:32,560
The truth was that he had no home and that
was why he never talked about it.

1558
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,830
Mussolini had forced his family to move to
Libya, and there they had been attacked by

1559
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:44,030
rebels and had died, while he lay in hospital
with a high fever.

1560
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:48,730
Of all the relatives' houses where he had
stayed, which one was home?

1561
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:56,190
He had no family except his soldiers and his
mandolin, and his heart was there in Greece.

1562
01:53:56,190 --> 01:54:02,601
Had he suffered so much pain, so much loneliness,
had he finally found a place to be, only to

1563
01:54:02,601 --> 01:54:04,710
have it torn away?

1564
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:10,650
His memories of his parents were as thin and
indefinite as those of a ghost, and for the

1565
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:16,440
first time he began to feel as if Pelagia
already belonged to his past.

1566
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,730
He thought about dying and wondered how long
Pelagia would weep, and what a shame it would

1567
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:28,890
be to spoil her lovely flesh with tears; it
broke his heart to imagine it.

1568
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:34,070
He wanted to reach out from beyond the grave
and comfort her, even though he was not yet

1569
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:36,060
dead.

1570
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:41,440
He went to the doctor's house and asked them
to look after his mandolin, and Pelagia wrapped

1571
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,810
it in a blanket and put it under the hole
in the floor.

1572
01:54:44,810 --> 01:54:51,469
They told him about Carlo's visit, and how
he had left a thick pile of papers with them.

1573
01:54:51,469 --> 01:54:57,050
The captain had not known that Carlo had ambitions
to be a writer and was curious about the content

1574
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:59,300
of the big man's papers.

1575
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:05,199
He thought that Pelagia looked very thin and
almost ill, and when she sadly stroked his

1576
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:11,199
cheek, he almost did not know how to prevent
his tears.

1577
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:12,199
***

1578
01:55:12,199 --> 01:55:17,320
After Italy's surrender to the Allies, General
Gandin, leader of the Italian troops on Cephallonia,

1579
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:21,699
suffered terrible indecision about the course
of action he should take.

1580
01:55:21,699 --> 01:55:24,150
He had two choices.

1581
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:28,510
Compared to the number of Italian soldiers
on the island, there were many fewer German

1582
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:33,900
troops, and he could insist that the German
soldiers laid down their arms and surrendered

1583
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,960
to the superior Italian forces.

1584
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:42,800
If the Germans rejected this, then the Italian
troops could theoretically attack and overcome

1585
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,010
them.

1586
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:49,720
But Gandin knew that he would receive no support
from the Allies, and moreover, that he would

1587
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:54,110
have neither air nor sea support from his
own country.

1588
01:55:54,110 --> 01:55:59,300
He knew that the Germans still had a large
number of bomber planes based in mainland

1589
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:04,050
Greece, and the thought of those death machines
screaming over the island as they dropped

1590
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:08,260
their bombs filled him with horror.

1591
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:14,080
These thoughts led the General to the second
option, which was to surrender to the Germans,

1592
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:19,480
on condition that the latter gave written
guarantees of the safety of the Italian soldiers

1593
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:21,690
on the island.

1594
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:27,330
This would mean trusting the Germans not to
break their promises and attack the Italians.

1595
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:31,690
It was this second route that Gandin was tempted
to take.

1596
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:37,171
He was, in a strange way, a man of honour,
and still considered the Germans to be his

1597
01:56:37,171 --> 01:56:39,770
allies.

1598
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:45,050
Unlike General Gandin, the Italian troops
on Cephallonia knew exactly what should be

1599
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:46,239
done.

1600
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:51,220
They heard from the radio that the Germans,
as they withdrew in Italy, were killing and

1601
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:56,660
looting along the way and they could see no
reason why the Germans would not do the same

1602
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:58,489
in Cephallonia, given the chance.

1603
01:56:58,489 --> 01:57:05,040
While Gandin delayed, unable to make up his
mind, and his soldiers became almost crazy

1604
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:11,960
with anger and fear, the Germans quietly flew
more arms and troops to the island.

1605
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:15,880
Finally General Gandin came to a decision.

1606
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:20,630
Despite the universal demand of his men that
the Germans should be forced to surrender,

1607
01:57:20,630 --> 01:57:25,230
the General agreed with the German leaders
on the island that the Italians should be

1608
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:29,930
allowed to keep their weapons and peacefully
leave Cephallonia.

1609
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:35,200
There were no ships, however, to take the
Italians away, a point which did not seem

1610
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:38,010
significant to Gandin.

1611
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:44,160
Some of the Italian troops, guessing what
was likely to happen, became deeply depressed,

1612
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:50,380
while others, like Corelli, developed an iron
determination and prepared their men to the

1613
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:56,220
last degree for the terrible battle that they
were certain lay ahead of them.

1614
01:57:56,220 --> 01:58:01,489
When the German bomber planes arrived, early
in the afternoon, tipping their wings, it

1615
01:58:01,489 --> 01:58:05,489
was almost a relief to the waiting Italians.

1616
01:58:05,489 --> 01:58:12,110
Now everything was clear; it was at last obvious
that the Germans had betrayed them and that

1617
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:15,760
every Italian soldier would have to fight
for his life.

1618
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:20,880
Gunter Weber knew that he would have to turn
his weapons on his friends.

1619
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:27,180
Corelli knew that his musician's fingers,
so well accustomed to the arts of peace, must

1620
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:30,600
now tighten around a gun.

1621
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:36,070
General Gandin knew too late that he had made
the wrong decision and that, as a result,

1622
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:37,670
his men were going to die.

1623
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:45,219
Pelagia knew that a war that had always been
somewhere else would now settle upon her home

1624
01:58:45,219 --> 01:58:49,430
and turn its stones to dust.

1625
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:55,120
The German planes attacked Argostoli first
because that was where most Italian troops

1626
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:56,600
were concentrated.

1627
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:02,910
Gandin made the foolish mistake of bringing
his troops into the town in increasing numbers,

1628
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:08,360
and this made it easier for the Germans to
isolate and cut them down.

1629
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:14,100
Houses were crushed by the bombs and soldiers
and islanders died in large numbers.

1630
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:20,180
More and more German soldiers were flown in,
and spread all over the island, killing as

1631
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:22,210
they went.

1632
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:27,330
Everyone knew that no ships or planes would
come to aid an island of Cephallonia's insignificance.

1633
01:59:27,330 --> 01:59:34,270
On a hillside, Bunny Warren sat by his radio
and tried to persuade his superiors that they

1634
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:41,719
should provide the Italians with air and sea
support, but without success.

1635
01:59:41,719 --> 01:59:42,719
***

1636
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:47,570
Dr Iannis and his daughter sat side by side
at their kitchen table, unable to sleep, holding

1637
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:49,320
each others' hands.

1638
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:52,070
Pelagia was weeping.

1639
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:57,489
The doctor wanted to relight his pipe, but
out of respect for his daughter's feelings

1640
01:59:57,489 --> 02:00:04,440
he allowed his hands to stay in hers, and
he repeated, 'Koritsimou, I am sure he is

1641
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,489
all right.'

1642
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:08,410
'But we haven't seen him for days,' she cried.

1643
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:10,310
'I just know he's dead.'

1644
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:14,830
'If he was dead someone would have told us,
someone from La Scala.

1645
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:18,420
They were all nice boys, they would let us
know.'

1646
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:19,489
'Were?'

1647
02:00:19,489 --> 02:00:20,610
she repeated.

1648
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:23,080
'You think they're all dead?

1649
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:26,640
You think they're dead too, don't you?'

1650
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:31,090
'Oh God,' the doctor sighed.

1651
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:36,860
It was on the morning of 22 September that
Captain Antonio Corelli, knowing that his

1652
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:42,430
leaders were planning to surrender to the
Germans, having had no sleep for three days,

1653
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:46,680
climbed on his motorcycle and sped towards
Pelagia's house.

1654
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:52,770
He threw himself into her arms, resting his
burning eyes upon her shoulder, and told her,

1655
02:00:52,770 --> 02:00:55,320
'We are lost.

1656
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:56,780
The British have betrayed us.'

1657
02:00:56,780 --> 02:01:03,270
She begged him to stay, to hide in the house,
in the hole in the floor, with his mandolin

1658
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:09,219
and Carlo's papers, but he took her face in
his hands, kissed her without the tears that

1659
02:01:09,219 --> 02:01:14,610
he was too tired to weep, and then rocked
her in his arms, squeezing her so tightly

1660
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:18,240
that she thought that her bones would crack.

1661
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:24,950
He kissed her again and said, 'Koritsimou,
this is the last time I shall ever see you.

1662
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:31,719
There has been no honour in this war, but
I have to be with my boys.'

1663
02:01:31,719 --> 02:01:37,930
With his head hanging down, he told her, 'Koritsimou,
I am going to die.

1664
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:40,550
Remember me to your father.

1665
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:46,110
And I thank God I have lived long enough to
love you.'

1666
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:51,320
She watched him go as he drove away on his
motorcycle, the dust cloud surrounding his

1667
02:01:51,320 --> 02:02:02,390
head, then she went inside and sat at the
kitchen table, terror gripping her heart.

1668
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:04,930
CHAPTER TEN
The Order to Kill

1669
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:14,260
Gunter Weber stood before his superior officer
and, his face hard with determination, said,

1670
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:18,480
'Sir, I must request that you give this task
to someone else.

1671
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:21,550
I cannot carry it out.'

1672
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:26,260
His superior raised an eyebrow but somehow
failed to feel any anger.

1673
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:32,510
The truth was that in this position he hoped
that he would have done the same.

1674
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:35,480
'Why not?' he asked.

1675
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,969
'Sir, it is against international law to murder
prisoners of war.

1676
02:02:39,969 --> 02:02:41,550
It is also wrong.

1677
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:44,180
I must request to be excused.'

1678
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:47,540
'They have betrayed us, their allies.'

1679
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:54,989
'I realize that, but I am not a criminal,
sir, and I do not wish to become one.'

1680
02:02:54,989 --> 02:02:57,040
The officer sighed.

1681
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,840
'War is a dirty business, you know that.

1682
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:03,280
We all have to do terrible things.

1683
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:10,949
For example, I like you and I admire you for
taking this position, but I must remind you

1684
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:15,190
that the punishment for refusing to obey an
order is death.

1685
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:19,400
I don't state this as a threat but as a fact
of life.

1686
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:22,420
You know this as well as I do.'

1687
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:24,450
He walked to the window and then turned.

1688
02:03:24,450 --> 02:03:27,050
'They're all going to be shot anyway.

1689
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:29,880
Why add your death to theirs?

1690
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,890
It would be a waste of a fine officer.'

1691
02:03:31,890 --> 02:03:40,610
Gunter Weber swallowed hard and his lips trembled
so that he found it hard to speak.

1692
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:47,520
At last he said, 'I request that my protest
is recorded and put in my file, sir.'

1693
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:52,560
'Your request is granted,' said the officer
and left the room.

1694
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:59,280
Weber leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette,
but his hands shook so much that he immediately

1695
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:00,570
dropped it.

1696
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:07,010
'Let's sing, boys,' said Antonio Corelli,
looking round the inside of the truck where

1697
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:10,940
his men sat, watched by expressionless German
soldiers.

1698
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:17,680
One of the Italians was already tearful, others
were praying, their heads bowed down to their

1699
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:18,730
knees.

1700
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:24,300
Corelli felt strangely happy as if he were
drunk with tiredness and the absolute certainty

1701
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,410
of death.

1702
02:04:25,410 --> 02:04:28,560
Why not smile in the face of death?

1703
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:34,969
'Let's sing, boys,' he repeated, 'Carlo, sing.'

1704
02:04:34,969 --> 02:04:40,720
Carlo gazed at him with eyes full of endless
sorrow, and began very softly to sing a song

1705
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:47,360
from an opera they all loved, Madame Butterfly,
and soon others joined in, when they felt

1706
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:49,570
able to.

1707
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:55,570
The tune comforted them, and it was easier
to sing than to think on death; it gave the

1708
02:04:55,570 --> 02:04:59,070
heart something to do.

1709
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:04,030
When the truck arrived, Gunter Weber's knees
began to shake.

1710
02:05:04,030 --> 02:05:08,370
Almost before it had arrived, it seemed that
he had known that life had called him to the

1711
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:10,640
killing of his friends.

1712
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:16,530
He had not expected them to arrive singing
the tune that he and La Scala had sung together

1713
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:21,719
late at night at the doctor's house, nor had
he expected them to jump so lightly from the

1714
02:05:21,719 --> 02:05:23,330
truck.

1715
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:29,480
He ordered a German soldier to put his friends
against the wall, lit another cigarette and

1716
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:36,430
turned away, but finally he turned again and
approached the Italians.

1717
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:41,110
More than half of them were praying, kneeling
in the soil, and others wept like children

1718
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:43,270
at a death.

1719
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:46,550
Antonio Corelli and Carlo Guercio were embracing.

1720
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:51,170
Weber reached for his packet of cigarettes
and approached them.

1721
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:57,720
'Cigarette?' he asked them, and Corelli took
one, Carlo refusing.

1722
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:04,550
Corelli looked at Weber and said, 'Your hands
are trembling and your legs.'

1723
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:08,780
'Antonio, I am very sorry, I tried...'

1724
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:15,040
Corelli sucked on his cigarette and said,
'I am sure you did, Gunter, I know how it

1725
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,040
goes.'

1726
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:23,560
Weber's face trembled with the effort of hiding
his tears, and at last he said suddenly, 'Forgive

1727
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,720
me.'

1728
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:31,550
Carlo made a sound of disgust in his throat
and said, 'You will never be forgiven.'

1729
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:37,750
But Corelli put his hand up to silence his
friend and said quietly, 'Gunter, I forgive

1730
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:38,750
you.

1731
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:42,010
If I do not, who will?'

1732
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:44,870
Weber held out his hand.

1733
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:48,949
'Goodbye, Gunter,' said Corelli, taking it.

1734
02:06:48,949 --> 02:06:54,219
Allowing his hand to remain in his former
friend's, he shook it briefly one final time

1735
02:06:54,219 --> 02:06:56,030
and released it.

1736
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:59,810
He linked an arm through Carlo's, and smiled
up at him.

1737
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:04,989
'Come,' he said, 'we two have been companions
in life.

1738
02:07:04,989 --> 02:07:08,820
Let's go together to heaven.'

1739
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:11,320
It was a beautiful day to die.

1740
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:18,300
A few soft clouds hid the top of Mount Aenos
and nearby a goatbell rang.

1741
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:23,500
Corelli realized that his own legs were shaking
and that he could do nothing to prevent it.

1742
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:30,469
He thought about Pelagia, with her dark eyes,
her passionate nature, her black hair.

1743
02:07:30,469 --> 02:07:36,070
He saw her clearly in his mind's eye: making
a blanket that grew smaller every day; arm

1744
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:42,429
in arm with her father, returning from the
sea; kissing Gunter Weber on the cheek at

1745
02:07:42,429 --> 02:07:44,850
the offer of the record player.

1746
02:07:44,850 --> 02:07:51,429
Pelagia, whose form had been so sweetly rounded,
now so pale and thin.

1747
02:07:51,429 --> 02:07:57,739
A Croatian soldier approached Weber, a man
who, in Weber's opinion, had a dangerously

1748
02:07:57,739 --> 02:07:59,490
violent nature.

1749
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:03,760
The Croatian said, 'Sir, more will be arriving.

1750
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:05,239
We can't delay.'

1751
02:08:05,239 --> 02:08:08,620
'Very well,' said Weber.

1752
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:14,800
He closed his eyes and prayed, a prayer without
words to a God who did not care.

1753
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:20,550
There was nothing formal about the killings,
and the victims were not lined up against

1754
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:23,660
the wall or made to face forwards.

1755
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:30,520
Many of them were left on their knees, praying
or weeping or begging for mercy.

1756
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:37,730
Some stood smoking as if at a party, and Carlo
stood next to Corelli, glad to die at last

1757
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:41,630
and determined to die a soldier's death.

1758
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:46,510
Corelli put one hand in his pocket to steady
the shaking of his leg, and deeply breathed

1759
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:51,510
the Cephallonian air that held Pelagia's breath.

1760
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:56,940
The German boys heard the command to fire
and fired in disbelief.

1761
02:08:56,940 --> 02:09:02,570
Those of them whose eyes were open aimed wide
or high, or aimed to avoid a death.

1762
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:08,870
The Croatian soldier shot to kill, firing
rapidly and taking careful aim.

1763
02:09:08,870 --> 02:09:12,160
Weber's head spun.

1764
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:17,540
His former friends were leaping and dancing
in the rain of bullets, were crying out, stumbling

1765
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:21,949
to their knees, arms waving, their mouths
filled with blood.

1766
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:29,620
But what no one had seen, even Weber, was
that at the order to fire, Carlo had stepped

1767
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:36,090
quickly sideways in front of Corelli, and
had gripped the latter's wrists so tightly

1768
02:09:36,090 --> 02:09:38,949
that he was unable to move.

1769
02:09:38,949 --> 02:09:44,400
Corelli stared wonderingly into the middle
of Carlo's back as great holes burst though

1770
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:49,340
from inside the latter's body, releasing fountains
of blood.

1771
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:56,120
Carlo stood unbroken as one bullet after another
entered his chest like white-hot knives.

1772
02:09:56,120 --> 02:10:03,969
He stood perfectly still and counted to thirty,
looked up at the sky and then threw himself

1773
02:10:03,969 --> 02:10:06,580
over backwards.

1774
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:13,370
Corelli lay beneath him, unable to move, so
astonished by this extraordinary, saintly

1775
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:18,230
act of love that he did not hear the Croatian
soldier's voice.

1776
02:10:18,230 --> 02:10:21,300
'Italians, it's all over.

1777
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:27,640
If any of you are living, stand up now and
you will go free.'

1778
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:33,199
He did not see the two or three stand up and
see them fall again as the Croatian shot them

1779
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,940
down.

1780
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:41,210
Then he heard the single shots as Weber, drunk
with horror, wandered among the dead, putting

1781
02:10:41,210 --> 02:10:44,830
those still living out of their pain.

1782
02:10:44,830 --> 02:10:50,640
Next to his head he saw Weber's boot and he
saw Weber bend down and look directly into

1783
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:55,390
his eyes where he lay trapped beneath Carlo's
great weight.

1784
02:10:55,390 --> 02:11:02,410
He saw the shaking gun approach his face,
he saw the ocean of sorrow in Webers eyes,

1785
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:07,290
and then he saw the gun withdrawn, unfired.

1786
02:11:07,290 --> 02:11:12,449
He tried to breathe more freely, and realized
he was having difficulty, not only because

1787
02:11:12,449 --> 02:11:17,590
of Carlo's weight but because the bullets
that had passed through his friend had also

1788
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:21,309
struck himself.

1789
02:11:21,309 --> 02:11:22,309
***

1790
02:11:22,309 --> 02:11:27,320
Corelli lay beneath his friend for hours,
their blood mixing in the soil, in their uniforms,

1791
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:29,010
in their flesh.

1792
02:11:29,010 --> 02:11:35,830
It was not until evening that Velisarios came
across the heap of tragic bodies, and recognized

1793
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:41,739
the man as big as himself who had once reached
a hand across the barrier of war and offered

1794
02:11:41,739 --> 02:11:43,930
him a cigarette.

1795
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:50,730
He looked down into the vacant and staring
eyes, reached down and tried to close them.

1796
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:57,250
He failed, and was struck by the horror of
leaving such a brother to the wind and birds.

1797
02:11:57,250 --> 02:12:04,640
He knelt down and with a huge effort he lifted
Carlo from the ground, and, as he did so,

1798
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:09,810
he saw the mad captain who was staying at
the doctor's, the one whose 'secret' love

1799
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:14,800
for Pelagia was known and discussed by everyone
on the island.

1800
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,352
The man's eyes were not vacant and they blinked.

1801
02:12:17,352 --> 02:12:21,570
The lips moved.

1802
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:25,920
'Doctor,' said the dying man.

1803
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:28,390
'Pelagia.'

1804
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:31,820
The strong man put Carlo against the wall.

1805
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:37,699
Then he carefully picked the captain up, felt
how light he was, and set off across the stony

1806
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:40,410
fields to save his life.

1807
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:47,010
Nobody knows the exact number of the Italian
dead that lay upon the earth of Cephallonia,

1808
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:52,010
but at least four thousand were murdered,
possibly nine thousand.

1809
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:58,449
The evidence was lost in flame, because the
Germans, displaying knowledge of their guilt,

1810
02:12:58,449 --> 02:13:04,340
burnt the bodies, cutting down trees that
were a thousand years old to make the fires.

1811
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:11,800
They changed flesh into smoke, they put one
dead boy after another across their shoulders

1812
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:17,590
and tipped them into the flames, working until
their legs weakened and the flames became

1813
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:21,030
too hot to approach.

1814
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:26,650
One of the bodies that they burned was the
body of General Gandin, who trusted his enemies

1815
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:29,719
and tried to save his men.

1816
02:13:29,719 --> 02:13:35,180
Another who died at this time was Father Arsenios,
the priest from Pelagia's village.

1817
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:40,360
He wandered among the bodies and the flames
until he was so mad with grief that he began

1818
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:45,430
to beat the heads and shoulders of the German
soldiers with a stick.

1819
02:13:45,430 --> 02:13:51,970
At first the soldiers, who had murdered thousands,
did not know what to do, but then an officer

1820
02:13:51,970 --> 02:13:58,179
came up behind Arsenios and fired a single
shot into the back of his neck, exploding

1821
02:13:58,179 --> 02:14:00,750
his brains.

1822
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:06,760
Men and women and the few Italian soldiers
who had escaped approached the fires as closely

1823
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:12,310
as the heat permitted and began to pull away
the bodies at the edge of the fires.

1824
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:18,820
All of them thought the same things: 'Is this
what it will be like under the Germans?

1825
02:14:18,820 --> 02:14:21,739
How many of these boys could there have been?

1826
02:14:21,739 --> 02:14:23,210
How many of these boys did I know?

1827
02:14:23,210 --> 02:14:28,240
Can I imagine how it is to die of bleeding,
slowly?'

1828
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:35,910
At dawn a thick, black cloud hung over the
land and blocked out the sun, and the people

1829
02:14:35,910 --> 02:14:43,590
returned to their houses and locked their
doors.

1830
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:48,140
CHAPTER ELEVEN
An Operation

1831
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:53,890
When the door was suddenly kicked open just
as it was getting dark, Pelagia's first thought

1832
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:58,989
was that it was the Germans, since she knew
that all the Italians were dead.

1833
02:14:58,989 --> 02:15:05,010
Like everybody else she had heard the sounds
of battle and seen truck after truck pass

1834
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:10,740
by, bearing either cheering German soldiers
or the dead bodies of Italians.

1835
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:16,070
At night she had gone out with her father,
whose cheeks were trembling with tears of

1836
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:22,489
anger and pity, and looked for lives to save
among those bodies abandoned in the fires.

1837
02:15:22,489 --> 02:15:30,880
It had left her speechless, not with fear
or sorrow, but with emptiness.

1838
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:36,910
When the door flew open she was frightened,
but she had nevertheless, somehow been expecting

1839
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:37,910
it.

1840
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:40,510
Her gun was ready in her pocket.

1841
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:48,140
She stood up, her hand tightening around the
gun, her face colourless, and saw Velisarios,

1842
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:49,739
breathing hard.

1843
02:15:49,739 --> 02:15:53,800
He advanced to the table and gently placed
his burden on it.

1844
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:56,370
'Who is it?' asked Pelagia.

1845
02:15:56,370 --> 02:15:58,429
'He's alive,' said Velisarios.

1846
02:15:58,429 --> 02:16:03,210
'It's the mad captain.'

1847
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:08,630
She bent down to look with eyes full of both
horror and hope, but she did not recognize

1848
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:12,760
him; there were too many holes, too much blood.

1849
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:16,330
She wanted to touch him but withdrew her hand.

1850
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:19,670
Where does one touch a man like this?

1851
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:25,160
The body opened its eyes and the mouth smiled.

1852
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:32,460
'Kalimera, koritsimou,' it said, and she recognized
the voice.

1853
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:35,540
'It's the evening,' she said foolishly.

1854
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:40,599
'Kalispera, then,' he whispered and closed
his eyes.

1855
02:16:40,599 --> 02:16:49,090
Pelagia looked up at Velisarios, her eyes
wide and desperate, and said, 'Velisarios,

1856
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:51,130
you have never done a greater thing.

1857
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:52,859
I'm going to get my father.

1858
02:16:52,859 --> 02:16:54,779
Stay with him.'

1859
02:16:54,779 --> 02:17:00,010
She found her father at the kapheneion and
dragged him out, ignoring the angry stares

1860
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:03,729
of the other men, and Kokolios, who roared
at her.

1861
02:17:03,729 --> 02:17:08,569
The doctor looked at the body and knew he
had never seen anything worse.

1862
02:17:08,569 --> 02:17:12,489
There was enough blood to fill the veins of
a horse.

1863
02:17:12,489 --> 02:17:19,830
'It would be kinder to kill him,' he said,
but before Velisarios could say, 'I thought

1864
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:24,530
so too,' Pelagia began beating her father
with both hands.

1865
02:17:24,530 --> 02:17:33,260
And so water was put on to boil and the rags
of the captain's uniform were gently cut away.

1866
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:36,000
Dr Iannis complained as he cleaned away the
blood.

1867
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,809
'What am I supposed to do?

1868
02:17:38,809 --> 02:17:41,689
I have no equipment to perform an operation.'

1869
02:17:41,689 --> 02:17:48,869
'Shut up, shut up, shut up,' Pelagia shouted,
her heart racing with both fear and determination.

1870
02:17:48,869 --> 02:17:53,169
'Just shut up and do it.'

1871
02:17:53,169 --> 02:17:57,499
Because the doctor was unaware that most of
the blood and flesh had belonged to the broad

1872
02:17:57,499 --> 02:18:03,749
back of Carlo Guercio, it seemed unbelievable
to him that Antonio Corelli was as little

1873
02:18:03,749 --> 02:18:06,149
wounded as he was.

1874
02:18:06,149 --> 02:18:11,590
Once he was cleaned, it was clear that the
victim had six bullets in his chest, one in

1875
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:16,889
the stomach, and one through the outer flesh
in his right arm.

1876
02:18:16,889 --> 02:18:23,840
But the doctor knew too much to be optimistic
and it still seemed hopeless.

1877
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:29,429
Frightened of the task that lay ahead of him,
he opened a bottle of raki, drank deeply and

1878
02:18:29,429 --> 02:18:33,309
passed the bottle to Velisarios, who did the
same.

1879
02:18:33,309 --> 02:18:39,179
Then, with the comforting taste of alcohol
in his mouth, he reached for an instrument

1880
02:18:39,179 --> 02:18:45,239
and moved it gently around in each wound until
he felt it reach a bullet.

1881
02:18:45,239 --> 02:18:51,340
He stood up amazed, realizing that the holes
were not even deep and that the bullets should

1882
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:56,590
have passed right through the victim's body
but had not done so.

1883
02:18:56,590 --> 02:19:04,949
'Daughter,' he said, 'I swear by all the saints
that this man's flesh is made of steel.

1884
02:19:04,949 --> 02:19:08,050
I think he'll live.'

1885
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:12,609
'Antonio,' he called, and Corelli opened his
eyes.

1886
02:19:12,609 --> 02:19:15,909
'Antonio, I'm going to operate.

1887
02:19:15,909 --> 02:19:18,080
I haven't got much morphia.

1888
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,039
Can you drink?'

1889
02:19:20,039 --> 02:19:25,229
Corelli nodded, and Pelagia poured a cup of
raki down his throat while the doctor injected

1890
02:19:25,229 --> 02:19:27,419
morphia into his arm.

1891
02:19:27,419 --> 02:19:33,810
Pelagia looked at that desperately damaged
body, helpless as a worm, and knew that it

1892
02:19:33,810 --> 02:19:38,999
was not exactly a body that one loved, but
that one loved the man who shone out through

1893
02:19:38,999 --> 02:19:44,429
the eyes and used his mouth to smile and speak.

1894
02:19:44,429 --> 02:19:48,279
The doctor saw her dreaming and said, 'Don't
just sit there.

1895
02:19:48,279 --> 02:19:49,950
We need more boiling water.

1896
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:55,149
And wash your hands, especially under the
nails.'

1897
02:19:55,149 --> 02:20:00,729
Pelagia discovered in that hour how difficult
the task was that she had set her father.

1898
02:20:00,729 --> 02:20:07,189
Her hands trembled, and at first she could
hardly force herself to touch the captain.

1899
02:20:07,189 --> 02:20:12,350
She looked up and saw her father cutting wide
holes around the bullet wounds and had to

1900
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:16,119
resist her desire to be sick.

1901
02:20:16,119 --> 02:20:21,569
The doctor started on the bullet in the stomach,
since he needed to do something that was relatively

1902
02:20:21,569 --> 02:20:25,160
easy in order to increase his confidence.

1903
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:31,310
He found it not far beneath the surface of
the skin and picked it out, amazed by its

1904
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,949
flattened shape.

1905
02:20:32,949 --> 02:20:37,420
'It's unbelievable,' he said, showing it to
Pelagia.

1906
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:40,250
'How do you explain this?'

1907
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:46,109
'He was behind that big man, the one as big
as me,' said Velisarios.

1908
02:20:46,109 --> 02:20:51,380
'The big man was holding him from behind,
like this.'

1909
02:20:51,380 --> 02:20:57,600
He stood up and put his hands behind his back
to show how one could grip another's wrists.

1910
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,700
'I think he was trying to save the man,' he
said.

1911
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:08,319
'Carlo,' said Pelagia, suddenly bursting into
tears.

1912
02:21:08,319 --> 02:21:13,510
Carlo was the first of the boys of La Scala
whom they now knew with certainty was dead.

1913
02:21:13,510 --> 02:21:19,260
'No man who dies like that has died for nothing,'
said the doctor, fighting back his own need

1914
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:21,529
for tears.

1915
02:21:21,529 --> 02:21:26,380
Pelagia wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her
dress and said, 'Antonio always said that

1916
02:21:26,380 --> 02:21:29,489
Carlo was the bravest in the Army.'

1917
02:21:29,489 --> 02:21:33,090
'Velisarios, is the man's body still there?

1918
02:21:33,090 --> 02:21:37,999
We would like to bury it and not see it burned,'
said the doctor.

1919
02:21:37,999 --> 02:21:42,060
'It's after dark, I'll go and look,' said
the strongman.

1920
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:46,680
'On the way, I might kill a German, who knows?'

1921
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:53,649
He departed, happy to be out of that house
where the sights were enough to make one ill.

1922
02:21:53,649 --> 02:21:58,020
When the doctor had finished cleaning out
the wound, he gave Pelagia the task of sewing

1923
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:05,499
it up, and she did so with accuracy and care,
despite her feeling of the unreality of it

1924
02:22:05,499 --> 02:22:06,499
all.

1925
02:22:06,499 --> 02:22:10,920
Velisarios buried Carlo Guercio's remains
that night in the yard of the doctor's house.

1926
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:16,810
Just before dawn, when the operation on the
captain was finished at last, and father and

1927
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:22,579
daughter were both utterly exhausted, they
came out to say their goodbye to that heroic

1928
02:22:22,579 --> 02:22:23,669
soldier.

1929
02:22:23,669 --> 02:22:30,619
Pelagia combed the hair and kissed the forehead,
and Velisarios placed a cigarette in the dead

1930
02:22:30,619 --> 02:22:31,859
man's lips.

1931
02:22:31,859 --> 02:22:35,029
'I owed him one,' he said.

1932
02:22:35,029 --> 02:22:39,659
The doctor made a speech while Pelagia wept
beside him.

1933
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:42,140
'Sleep long and well,' he ended.

1934
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:48,130
'As long as we remember you, you will be remembered
fair and young.'

1935
02:22:48,130 --> 02:22:52,909
Leaning upon each other, the doctor and his
daughter returned inside.

1936
02:22:52,909 --> 02:23:02,170
Carefully, they carried Corelli to Pelagia's
bed, and outside the first birds sang.

1937
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:03,170
***

1938
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:07,060
It was only a short time before the Germans
began to take an interest in loot.

1939
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:12,569
Not only did the doctor have to hide his valuables,
he also had to hide an Italian officer who

1940
02:23:12,569 --> 02:23:16,560
lay, unable to move, in his daughter's bed.

1941
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:23,039
Pelagia made a bed for him at the bottom of
the hole in the kitchen, and once again Velisarios

1942
02:23:23,039 --> 02:23:25,369
was called in to carry him.

1943
02:23:25,369 --> 02:23:32,699
There Corelli was reunited with his mandolin
and Carlo's papers were temporarily removed.

1944
02:23:32,699 --> 02:23:37,850
The lid of the hiding-place was left open
unless troops were in the neighbourhood.

1945
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:43,539
For the first day after the operation the
captain slept, but when he first woke, the

1946
02:23:43,539 --> 02:23:48,660
pain was so bad that he could not move at
all, and he felt as if he had been run over

1947
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:50,069
by a lorry.

1948
02:23:50,069 --> 02:23:54,479
'I can't breathe,' he told the doctor.

1949
02:23:54,479 --> 02:23:58,790
'If you couldn't breathe you couldn't speak.'

1950
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:05,930
The captain said nothing and the doctor continued,
'It appears that Carlo saved your life.'

1951
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:08,350
'It doesn't "appear".

1952
02:24:08,350 --> 02:24:10,699
I know he did.

1953
02:24:10,699 --> 02:24:14,199
Of all of us, he died the best.

1954
02:24:14,199 --> 02:24:17,310
And he's left me to remember it.'

1955
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:18,780
'You shouldn't weep, Captain.

1956
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:23,800
We are going to get you well, and then get
you off the island.'

1957
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:28,739
'When I am better you must move me from the
house, Doctor.

1958
02:24:28,739 --> 02:24:31,600
I don't want you in danger.

1959
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:34,699
If I am caught, I should die alone.'

1960
02:24:34,699 --> 02:24:41,090
'We can move you to your secret house, where
you used to go with Pelagia.

1961
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:42,499
Don't look so surprised.

1962
02:24:42,499 --> 02:24:44,370
Everybody knew.

1963
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:46,909
And you may not get better.

1964
02:24:46,909 --> 02:24:47,909
Remember that.'

1965
02:24:47,909 --> 02:24:52,100
'My God, Doctor, please tell me some lies.'

1966
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:55,569
'The truth will make us free.

1967
02:24:55,569 --> 02:25:00,649
We overcome fear by looking it in the eyes.'

1968
02:25:00,649 --> 02:25:06,199
The captain fell into a fever two days later
and Pelagia remained in the hiding-place with

1969
02:25:06,199 --> 02:25:10,800
him, wiping his forehead to reduce his temperature.

1970
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:16,700
The fever came to a crisis on the fourth day,
and Corelli was sweating so much and talking

1971
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:22,640
so nonsensically that both the doctor and
Pelagia feared for his life.

1972
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:29,090
But two days later the fever left, and the
patient opened his eyes with wonder, as if

1973
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:32,720
realizing that he existed for the first time.

1974
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:38,510
He felt weaker than it ought to be possible
to feel, but by the same evening he was able

1975
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:42,689
to stand with the doctor's help and let himself
be washed.

1976
02:25:42,689 --> 02:25:48,959
Pelagia fetched a mirror and showed him his
new-grown beard, and that night he was fed

1977
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:52,119
his first solid meal.

1978
02:25:52,119 --> 02:25:53,789
Snails.

1979
02:25:53,789 --> 02:25:54,789
***

1980
02:25:54,789 --> 02:25:59,439
In later life, Pelagia remembered the time
of Corelli's recovery and his escape not as

1981
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:06,380
a period of exciting adventure, nor even as
a time of fear and hope, but as the slow beginning

1982
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:09,119
of her sorrows.

1983
02:26:09,119 --> 02:26:11,609
The war had reduced her anyway.

1984
02:26:11,609 --> 02:26:17,910
Her skin, stretched tightly over her bones,
was transparent from lack of food, and when

1985
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:22,459
she ate she chewed carefully in case she lost
a tooth.

1986
02:26:22,459 --> 02:26:28,890
Her rich black hair had thinned and lost its
shine, and showed the first grey hairs that

1987
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:33,000
should not have appeared for at least another
decade.

1988
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:38,819
It was hard to obtain food, and the doctor
was reduced to trapping snakes and other such

1989
02:26:38,819 --> 02:26:40,669
creatures.

1990
02:26:40,669 --> 02:26:46,399
Things were not hopeless, however; there was
always the sea, the source of Cephallonia's

1991
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:48,520
being.

1992
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:53,459
As soon as Corelli could walk, he went in
the company of the doctor and Velisarios to

1993
02:26:53,459 --> 02:27:00,279
Casa Nostra at night, while Pelagia remained
at home in the hiding-place in which the mandolin,

1994
02:27:00,279 --> 02:27:05,130
the doctor's History and Carlo's papers had
been replaced.

1995
02:27:05,130 --> 02:27:11,069
As long as the German rapists were on the
island, she hardly left the house.

1996
02:27:11,069 --> 02:27:16,420
Corelli had given her his ring, too big for
any of her fingers, and she turned it round

1997
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:18,909
and round in the lamplight.

1998
02:27:18,909 --> 02:27:25,850
The captain came frequently, after dark, complaining
that the hut was cold, his new beard scratching

1999
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:31,520
her cheeks as they lay fully clothed upon
her bed, wrapped in each other's embrace,

2000
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,970
talking of the future and the past.

2001
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:39,610
'I will always hate the Germans,' she said.

2002
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:41,050
'Gunter saved my life.'

2003
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:43,810
'He murdered all your friends.'

2004
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:45,359
'He had no choice.

2005
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,329
It wouldn't surprise me if he shot himself
afterwards.

2006
02:27:49,329 --> 02:27:51,119
He was trying not to cry.'

2007
02:27:51,119 --> 02:27:53,909
'There is always a choice.'

2008
02:27:53,909 --> 02:27:56,470
'He wasn't brave like Carlo.

2009
02:27:56,470 --> 02:28:00,380
Only one in a million is made like that, you
mustn't blame poor Gunter.'

2010
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:06,600
Pelagia desperately wanted to keep her captain
on the island, but knew that she would kill

2011
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:08,649
him if she did.

2012
02:28:08,649 --> 02:28:13,090
There were people who were prepared to betray
for bread, and it could only be a matter of

2013
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:17,689
time before the Germans became aware of his
presence in their lives.

2014
02:28:17,689 --> 02:28:23,899
She asked Kokolios and Stamatis to enquire
for news of Bunnios, the English spy, and

2015
02:28:23,899 --> 02:28:27,279
to tell him to call on her if he could.

2016
02:28:27,279 --> 02:28:32,640
For some time now Bunny Warren had been encouraging
the owners of boats to help the few surviving

2017
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:38,499
Italian soldiers to escape from the island,
and it was easy for him to arrange the captain's

2018
02:28:38,499 --> 02:28:40,319
departure.

2019
02:28:40,319 --> 02:28:45,870
He called at Pelagia's home one night, tapping
softly on her window, and when she had removed

2020
02:28:45,870 --> 02:28:50,880
herself from Corelli's embrace, she looked
out and saw the man whose help she had both

2021
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,600
sought and feared.

2022
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:57,529
He came in through the door and very formally
shook her hand.

2023
02:28:57,529 --> 02:29:05,289
'Who is this?' asked Corelli, who for a moment
had been fearing a visit from the Germans.

2024
02:29:05,289 --> 02:29:11,329
'Bunnios,' said Pelagia, without answering
his question, 'this is an Italian soldier

2025
02:29:11,329 --> 02:29:13,560
and we have to get him out.'

2026
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:18,989
By chance a boat was leaving for Sicily the
following morning and it would be easy to

2027
02:29:18,989 --> 02:29:20,600
put the captain on board.

2028
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:25,910
They simply had to go to a certain bay at
one o'clock in the morning with a lamp, and

2029
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:31,390
flash out to sea in answer to the signals
flashed from the boat.

2030
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:36,529
Corelli did not go back to Casa Nostra before
dawn, but stayed with Pelagia in the house.

2031
02:29:36,529 --> 02:29:43,409
The three of them sat in that familiar kitchen,
saddened and fearful, talking quietly and

2032
02:29:43,409 --> 02:29:46,149
shaking their heads over all the memories.

2033
02:29:46,149 --> 02:29:50,080
'I owe my life to you, Doctor,' the captain
said.

2034
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:53,010
'I am sorry about the scars.

2035
02:29:53,010 --> 02:29:54,859
It was the best I could do.'

2036
02:29:54,859 --> 02:29:59,239
'And I am sorry, Doctor, about the rape of
the island.

2037
02:29:59,239 --> 02:30:01,640
I don't suppose we will ever be forgiven.'

2038
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:08,280
'As you know, Captain, I must have forgiven
you, or I would not have given you permission

2039
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:09,280
to marry my daughter.'

2040
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:17,340
Pelagia and Corelli looked at each other and
the captain said, 'We have decided that if

2041
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:21,899
we have a son, we will name him Iannis.'

2042
02:30:21,899 --> 02:30:27,289
The doctor was visibly delighted, even though
this was exactly what he would have expected

2043
02:30:27,289 --> 02:30:29,710
under the circumstances.

2044
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:37,090
He looked up, his eyes watering, and said
simply, 'Antonio, if I have ever had a son

2045
02:30:37,090 --> 02:30:38,090
it was you.

2046
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:42,319
You have a place at this table.'

2047
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:47,239
Corelli stood up and the two men embraced,
clapping each other on the back, and then

2048
02:30:47,239 --> 02:30:49,420
the doctor embraced his daughter.

2049
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:53,010
'I'll leave you two children together,' he
said.

2050
02:30:53,010 --> 02:30:56,280
'There is a little girl dying and I should
visit.'

2051
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:04,039
The doctor left the house and the two lovers
sat opposite each other, unable to speak.

2052
02:31:04,039 --> 02:31:09,530
Finally the tears began to follow each other
slowly down Pelagia's cheeks, and Corelli

2053
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:16,419
knelt beside her, put his arms around her
and laid his head against her chest.

2054
02:31:16,419 --> 02:31:22,030
He was shocked again at how thin she was and
closed his eyes tightly, imagining that it

2055
02:31:22,030 --> 02:31:23,289
was another world.

2056
02:31:23,289 --> 02:31:26,229
'I am so afraid,' she said.

2057
02:31:26,229 --> 02:31:32,399
'I think you won't come back, and the war
goes on and on forever, and there's no safety

2058
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:36,229
and no hope and I'll be left with nothing.'

2059
02:31:36,229 --> 02:31:42,289
'I shall not forget you and I will come back,'
replied Corelli.

2060
02:31:42,289 --> 02:31:43,289
'Promise?'

2061
02:31:43,289 --> 02:31:44,810
'I promise.

2062
02:31:44,810 --> 02:31:48,180
I have left you my ring and Antonia.'

2063
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:50,720
'We never read Carlo's papers.'

2064
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:51,999
'Too painful.

2065
02:31:51,999 --> 02:31:55,850
We'll read them when I return.'

2066
02:31:55,850 --> 02:32:04,329
She stroked his hair in silence and said finally,
'Antonio, I wish that we had... lain together.

2067
02:32:04,329 --> 02:32:06,149
As a man and woman.'

2068
02:32:06,149 --> 02:32:10,050
'Everything at the right time, koritsimou.'

2069
02:32:10,050 --> 02:32:12,800
'There may not be a time.'

2070
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:14,249
'There will be.

2071
02:32:14,249 --> 02:32:15,399
You have my promise.'

2072
02:32:15,399 --> 02:32:21,419
At eleven o'clock Bunny Warren scratched at
the window.

2073
02:32:21,419 --> 02:32:26,859
He carried a knife in his belt and sounded
extremely efficient as he gave detailed instructions

2074
02:32:26,859 --> 02:32:31,479
to the doctor, who translated them for Corelli's
benefit.

2075
02:32:31,479 --> 02:32:37,029
It was a cold December night, there was no
moon, and since most Germans preferred to

2076
02:32:37,029 --> 02:32:42,270
be indoors on such a night, the journey to
the beach was relatively safe.

2077
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:50,270
Nevertheless, Pelagia's heart beat fast and
a dark hole seemed to be opening in her heart.

2078
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:55,420
Corelli felt so sad he almost wished that
they would meet some German soldiers so that

2079
02:32:55,420 --> 02:33:00,030
he could die, fighting and killing, and end
it all.

2080
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:03,789
He knew that to leave the island would be
to lose his roots.

2081
02:33:03,789 --> 02:33:10,319
For warmth, the four of them stood close together
on the tiny patch of sand, waiting for the

2082
02:33:10,319 --> 02:33:14,409
flash of a lamp that would come to them from
the sea.

2083
02:33:14,409 --> 02:33:19,149
Corelli walked to the waterline and, seeing
the black waves, wondered how he would ever

2084
02:33:19,149 --> 02:33:21,470
survive the journey.

2085
02:33:21,470 --> 02:33:27,109
He felt his love for the island turning in
his chest like the twist of a knife, because

2086
02:33:27,109 --> 02:33:33,109
he had his own village now and even his thought
and speech had changed.

2087
02:33:33,109 --> 02:33:39,750
Returning to Pelagia, he held her face in
his hands and then embraced her.

2088
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:45,230
When the light flashed three times from the
sea and Warren returned the signal, Corelli

2089
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:52,499
shook his hand, kissed his father-in-law on
both cheeks and went to Pelagia once more.

2090
02:33:52,499 --> 02:33:54,959
There was nothing to be said.

2091
02:33:54,959 --> 02:34:00,359
He knew that her mouth was trembling with
grief and his throat was tight with the same

2092
02:34:00,359 --> 02:34:01,810
emotion.

2093
02:34:01,810 --> 02:34:06,289
He stroked her cheek tenderly and kissed her
eyes.

2094
02:34:06,289 --> 02:34:10,550
He heard the sound of the boat approaching
and looked up to see the shadows of two men

2095
02:34:10,550 --> 02:34:11,550
inside it.

2096
02:34:11,550 --> 02:34:18,890
The four approached the boat and the doctor
said, 'Go well, Antonio, and return.'

2097
02:34:18,890 --> 02:34:27,029
'May God hear you,' said the captain, and
for the last time he held Pelagia.

2098
02:34:27,029 --> 02:34:32,420
After he had climbed into the boat, disappearing
into the darkness like a ghost, Pelagia ran

2099
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:38,350
into the waves until the sea reached her thighs,
but though she tried to catch sight of him,

2100
02:34:38,350 --> 02:34:40,010
she saw nothing.

2101
02:34:40,010 --> 02:34:47,061
A terrible emptiness seized her and she put
her hands to her face and wept, bent over

2102
02:34:47,061 --> 02:34:56,010
in pain, her cries carried off in the wind
and were lost in the sound of the sea.

2103
02:34:56,010 --> 02:35:04,380
CHAPTER TWELVE
1943-9: The Years of Terror

2104
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:10,029
Of the German occupation there is little to
say, except that it caused the islanders to

2105
02:35:10,029 --> 02:35:14,189
feel more appreciation for the Italians they
had lost.

2106
02:35:14,189 --> 02:35:18,819
It seldom happens that a people can learn
to feel friendly towards their oppressors,

2107
02:35:18,819 --> 02:35:24,999
but hardly since Roman times had there been
any other kind of rule in Cephallonia.

2108
02:35:24,999 --> 02:35:29,689
Now there were no more Italians working in
the fields beside the farmers in order to

2109
02:35:29,689 --> 02:35:35,200
escape the boredom of army life, there were
no more football matches between teams that

2110
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:41,479
quarrelled and cheated, there were no flirtations
with girls by soldiers who had a cigarette

2111
02:35:41,479 --> 02:35:44,840
hanging from the corners of their mouths.

2112
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:50,359
There were no more voices sending out opera
tunes across the pine trees of the mountains.

2113
02:35:50,359 --> 02:35:56,709
Gone were the charming chicken-thieves, and
in their place came a period of time that

2114
02:35:56,709 --> 02:36:02,199
the doctor recorded in his History as the
worst time of all.

2115
02:36:02,199 --> 02:36:06,880
The islanders remember that the Germans were
not human beings.

2116
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:13,949
They were machines without principles, machines
that only knew how to loot and kill, without

2117
02:36:13,949 --> 02:36:20,310
any passion except the love of strength, and
without belief except in their natural right

2118
02:36:20,310 --> 02:36:23,090
to destroy an inferior race.

2119
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:30,529
The Italians had of course been thieves, but
their shame when caught showed that they recognized

2120
02:36:30,529 --> 02:36:32,039
their guilt.

2121
02:36:32,039 --> 02:36:38,020
The Germans came into the house at any time
of day, kicked over the furniture, beat the

2122
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:44,659
occupants, however old or young, and in front
of their eyes carried away whatever they liked.

2123
02:36:44,659 --> 02:36:50,450
Both Pelagia and her father were beaten at
different times for no apparent cause.

2124
02:36:50,450 --> 02:36:56,010
Drosoula had cigarettes burned into her skin
for frowning at an officer.

2125
02:36:56,010 --> 02:37:01,949
The doctor had all his precious medical equipment,
gathered together over twenty years of poverty,

2126
02:37:01,949 --> 02:37:08,319
broken in his presence by four officers whose
hearts were as dark and empty as the caves

2127
02:37:08,319 --> 02:37:10,669
of hell.

2128
02:37:10,669 --> 02:37:16,899
When in November 1944 the German troops were
ordered to withdraw, they destroyed every

2129
02:37:16,899 --> 02:37:21,899
building for which they found the time, and
the inhabitants of Cephallonia rose up against

2130
02:37:21,899 --> 02:37:26,760
them and fought them all the way to the sea.

2131
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:32,340
But the night before he left, Gunter Weber,
who had ashamedly stayed away from the house

2132
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:37,810
since the time of the killings, brought his
record player and his collection of Marlene

2133
02:37:37,810 --> 02:37:44,950
Dietrich records and left them outside Pelagia's
door, as he had promised in happier days.

2134
02:37:44,950 --> 02:37:51,319
He wrote a note in Italian: 'God be with you,
I will remember you always.'

2135
02:37:51,319 --> 02:37:57,989
Pelagia hid the record player in the hole
in the floor, with Antonio's mandolin and

2136
02:37:57,989 --> 02:38:03,830
Carlo's papers, and it survived the terrible
years that followed.

2137
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:04,830
***

2138
02:38:04,830 --> 02:38:11,449
The Germans left and the celebrations began,
but no sooner had the bells begun ringing

2139
02:38:11,449 --> 02:38:17,739
than the members of the Communist organization
ELAS, now calling themselves EAM, came out

2140
02:38:17,739 --> 02:38:22,159
from hiding and attempted to take control
of the country.

2141
02:38:22,159 --> 02:38:28,010
They formed Workers' Councils and elected
themselves to every post of authority.

2142
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:34,359
In Cephallonia the Communists began to send
awkward characters to prison camps.

2143
02:38:34,359 --> 02:38:41,170
On the mainland they poisoned, with dead animals,
the water of villages that opposed them.

2144
02:38:41,170 --> 02:38:47,079
Into mass graves they threw the dead bodies
of Greeks who had had their eyes torn out

2145
02:38:47,079 --> 02:38:51,250
and their mouths cut into the shape of a smile.

2146
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:56,459
They kidnapped 30,000 little children and
sent them across the border into Communist

2147
02:38:56,459 --> 02:39:00,479
Yugoslavia to be taught how to be true Communists.

2148
02:39:00,479 --> 02:39:06,449
ELAS soldiers captured by the British were
so frightened of their leaders that they begged

2149
02:39:06,449 --> 02:39:09,890
to be allowed to remain in British prison
camps.

2150
02:39:09,890 --> 02:39:16,199
Pelagia and the doctor were two out of millions
of people whose lives were forever destroyed

2151
02:39:16,199 --> 02:39:18,680
by these butchers.

2152
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:23,080
The doctor was dragged away in the night by
three men who had decided that since he was

2153
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:26,279
a doctor he must be a Fascist.

2154
02:39:26,279 --> 02:39:32,699
They threw Pelagia into a corner and beat
her unconscious with a chair.

2155
02:39:32,699 --> 02:39:37,720
When Kokolios came out from his house to defend
the doctor, he too was carried away, even

2156
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:40,390
though he was a Communist.

2157
02:39:40,390 --> 02:39:45,640
He was accompanied by Stamatis, a supporter
of the royal family, and the three men were

2158
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:48,949
taken to the harbour for transportation.

2159
02:39:48,949 --> 02:39:53,909
Pelagia did not know what had happened to
her father, and none of the authorities would

2160
02:39:53,909 --> 02:39:55,140
tell her.

2161
02:39:55,140 --> 02:40:01,510
Alone in the house, penniless and helpless,
for the first time in her life she thought

2162
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:05,050
of ending everything by killing herself.

2163
02:40:05,050 --> 02:40:09,569
The island seemed to be cursed by an endless
series of oppressors.

2164
02:40:09,569 --> 02:40:12,430
When would Antonio return?

2165
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:17,649
The war was continuing in Europe, and probably
he was dead.

2166
02:40:17,649 --> 02:40:22,029
She heard that the Communists had been killing
the Italian soldiers who had come to fight

2167
02:40:22,029 --> 02:40:24,410
alongside them against the Greeks.

2168
02:40:24,410 --> 02:40:27,949
Had the time come, finally, to hate the Greeks?

2169
02:40:27,949 --> 02:40:34,020
Of the nations who had broken into her house
to beat her and steal her possessions, only

2170
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:37,810
the Italians were innocent, it seemed.

2171
02:40:37,810 --> 02:40:40,200
Fortunately she had a friend.

2172
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:45,529
Drosoula had long known that Pelagia had lost
her love for Mandras, and that by his long

2173
02:40:45,529 --> 02:40:49,119
silence he had given up his rights.

2174
02:40:49,119 --> 02:40:55,100
She knew also that Pelagia was waiting for
an Italian, but she felt no bitterness and

2175
02:40:55,100 --> 02:40:59,289
never uttered a single word of blame.

2176
02:40:59,289 --> 02:41:04,409
When Pelagia stumbled bleeding through her
door after the Communists had taken Dr Iannis,

2177
02:41:04,409 --> 02:41:11,829
Drosoula, who had also suffered much, stroked
her hair and uttered loving words, as if Pelagia

2178
02:41:11,829 --> 02:41:14,819
were her own daughter.

2179
02:41:14,819 --> 02:41:19,640
Within a week she had closed up her little
house on the harbour and moved into the doctor's

2180
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:22,120
house on the hill.

2181
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:28,350
She found his Italian gun in a drawer and
kept it at her side in case of attack.

2182
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:32,909
Like Pelagia, Drosoula had been reduced by
the war.

2183
02:41:32,909 --> 02:41:38,640
The layers of fat had melted from her waist
and thighs, and her great ugly moon of a face

2184
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:40,140
had sunk inwards.

2185
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:48,279
However, her tall, thin form and grey hairs
demanded respect, and her unbroken spirit

2186
02:41:48,279 --> 02:41:51,239
gave Pelagia strength.

2187
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:57,149
For comfort they slept together in the doctor's
bed, and by day they made plans to find supplies

2188
02:41:57,149 --> 02:42:01,510
of food and listened to each others complaints
and stories.

2189
02:42:01,510 --> 02:42:06,189
They dug for roots in the undergrowth, and
Drosoula took her young friend down to the

2190
02:42:06,189 --> 02:42:08,550
harbour to learn to fish.

2191
02:42:08,550 --> 02:42:16,890
But Drosoula was out when Mandras returned,
full of selfimportance and new ideas, expecting

2192
02:42:16,890 --> 02:42:22,300
the admiring attention of the young woman
he had not seen for years, and determined

2193
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:25,069
to take revenge.

2194
02:42:25,069 --> 02:42:30,630
He came in through the door without knocking
and leaned his gun against the wall.

2195
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:36,870
When she heard the noise in the kitchen, Pelagia,
who was in her room, called out, 'Drosoula?'

2196
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:43,090
A man came in who she did not recognize, except
that he looked very like Drosoula had done

2197
02:42:43,090 --> 02:42:49,740
before the war; there was the same swollen
stomach and thighs, the same round, coarse

2198
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:52,109
face and thickened lips.

2199
02:42:52,109 --> 02:42:55,739
Puzzled, Pelagia stood up.

2200
02:42:55,739 --> 02:42:58,359
Mandras also was confused.

2201
02:42:58,359 --> 02:43:03,229
There was something about this desperately
thin, frightened girl that reminded him of

2202
02:43:03,229 --> 02:43:09,760
Pelagia, but this woman had silver threads
in her thin black hair, her blouse and skirt

2203
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:13,859
hung straight to the ground, her cheeks were
hollow.

2204
02:43:13,859 --> 02:43:18,659
He looked quickly around the room to see whether
Pelagia was there, assuming that this must

2205
02:43:18,659 --> 02:43:21,390
be a cousin or an aunt.

2206
02:43:21,390 --> 02:43:28,740
'Mandras, is it you?' said the woman, and
he recognized the voice.

2207
02:43:28,740 --> 02:43:35,479
He stood, amazed and confused, with much of
his hatred knocked out of him, while she looked

2208
02:43:35,479 --> 02:43:40,540
at those coarse and altered features and felt
deep disgust.

2209
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:47,149
'I thought you must be dead,' she said finally.

2210
02:43:47,149 --> 02:43:51,620
He closed the door and leaned against it.

2211
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:55,709
'You mean you were hoping I was dead.

2212
02:43:55,709 --> 02:43:57,370
As you see, I am not.

2213
02:43:57,370 --> 02:43:59,729
I am very much alive and well.

2214
02:43:59,729 --> 02:44:04,319
Don't I get a kiss from my fiancee?'

2215
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:08,669
She advanced fearfully and placed a kiss on
his right cheek.

2216
02:44:08,669 --> 02:44:14,069
'I am glad you are alive,' she said.

2217
02:44:14,069 --> 02:44:17,229
He caught both her wrists and held them tightly.

2218
02:44:17,229 --> 02:44:19,310
'I don't think you are.

2219
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:21,890
How is your father, by the way?

2220
02:44:21,890 --> 02:44:23,910
Is he not here?'

2221
02:44:23,910 --> 02:44:29,460
'Let me go,' she said softly, and he did so.

2222
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:33,319
'The Communists took him away' she told him.

2223
02:44:33,319 --> 02:44:36,960
'Well, he must have done something to deserve
it.'

2224
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:39,489
'He did nothing.

2225
02:44:39,489 --> 02:44:41,409
He healed the sick.

2226
02:44:41,409 --> 02:44:44,310
And they beat me with a chair and took everything.'

2227
02:44:44,310 --> 02:44:46,319
'There must be reasons.

2228
02:44:46,319 --> 02:44:48,499
The party is never wrong.

2229
02:44:48,499 --> 02:44:51,539
Whoever is not with us is against us.'

2230
02:44:51,539 --> 02:44:57,069
She noticed that he wore the red star of ELAS
sewn into the front of his cap.

2231
02:44:57,069 --> 02:45:00,909
'You're one of them,' she said.

2232
02:45:00,909 --> 02:45:05,379
He leaned against the door, placing all his
weight against it, increasing her sense of

2233
02:45:05,379 --> 02:45:07,539
imprisonment and her fear.

2234
02:45:07,539 --> 02:45:16,220
'Not just one of them, an important one of
them,' he stated, sounding pleased with himself,

2235
02:45:16,220 --> 02:45:22,090
then added challengingly, 'Soon we will have
a nice big house to live in.

2236
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:24,729
When shall we get married?'

2237
02:45:24,729 --> 02:45:28,250
She trembled and, seeing this, his anger increased.

2238
02:45:28,250 --> 02:45:31,770
'We will not be married,' she said.

2239
02:45:31,770 --> 02:45:36,329
'We were very young, it was not what we thought
it was.'

2240
02:45:36,329 --> 02:45:39,119
'Not what we thought?

2241
02:45:39,119 --> 02:45:44,199
And there was I, fighting for Greece, thinking
of you all day and dreaming of you at night.

2242
02:45:44,199 --> 02:45:48,610
And now I come back at last and find a faded
cow who has forgotten me.'

2243
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:51,359
'What's the matter with you?'

2244
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:52,359
she asked.

2245
02:45:52,359 --> 02:45:54,350
'The matter with me?'

2246
02:45:54,350 --> 02:45:57,479
He took from his pocket a thick bundle of
papers.

2247
02:45:57,479 --> 02:46:01,430
'This is what is the matter with me.'

2248
02:46:01,430 --> 02:46:05,330
He threw them towards her feet and she picked
them up slowly.

2249
02:46:05,330 --> 02:46:11,550
She held the bundle in her hands and realized
that it consisted of her letters to him in

2250
02:46:11,550 --> 02:46:12,649
Albania.

2251
02:46:12,649 --> 02:46:14,859
'My letters?'

2252
02:46:14,859 --> 02:46:19,390
she said, turning them over in her hands.

2253
02:46:19,390 --> 02:46:24,670
Mandras gave a sudden roar of disgust and,
seizing the letters, he found the last one,

2254
02:46:24,670 --> 02:46:33,459
held it up to the light and read, 'You never
write to me, and at first I was sad and worried.

2255
02:46:33,459 --> 02:46:38,470
Now I realize that you cannot care and this
has caused me to lose my love for you also.

2256
02:46:38,470 --> 02:46:43,239
I want you to know that I have decided to
release you from your promises.

2257
02:46:43,239 --> 02:46:46,069
I am sorry,'

2258
02:46:46,069 --> 02:46:50,489
He gave a smile that was both humourless and
threatening.

2259
02:46:50,489 --> 02:46:55,789
'Yes, I'm able to read now, and this is what
I found in the letters I had been carrying

2260
02:46:55,789 --> 02:46:57,439
next to my heart.

2261
02:46:57,439 --> 02:46:59,659
And now I know the truth.

2262
02:46:59,659 --> 02:47:03,560
Do you know the first thing I heard when I
arrived back here?

2263
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:08,560
I heard, "Mandras, did you hear about your
old fiancee?

2264
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:11,109
She's going to marry an Italian."

2265
02:47:11,109 --> 02:47:15,029
So you've found a Fascist for yourself, have
you?

2266
02:47:15,029 --> 02:47:19,060
Is this what I've been fighting for, you cow?'

2267
02:47:19,060 --> 02:47:24,109
Pelagia stood up, her lips trembling, and
said, 'Mandras, let me out.'

2268
02:47:24,109 --> 02:47:27,810
'Let me out,' he repeated, 'let me out.

2269
02:47:27,810 --> 02:47:30,449
Poor little thing's frightened, is she?'

2270
02:47:30,449 --> 02:47:35,709
He came up to her and struck her across the
face so hard that she spun round before she

2271
02:47:35,709 --> 02:47:36,789
fell.

2272
02:47:36,789 --> 02:47:41,609
He kicked her in the stomach and bent down
to pick her up by the wrists, then he threw

2273
02:47:41,609 --> 02:47:48,060
her on the bed and, quite against his original
intentions, began to tear at her clothes.

2274
02:47:48,060 --> 02:47:52,939
This rape of women was something that he could
not help, it seemed.

2275
02:47:52,939 --> 02:47:58,050
It was a feeling that came from deep inside
him, something he had learned in years of

2276
02:47:58,050 --> 02:48:01,810
not needing to explain his actions to anyone.

2277
02:48:01,810 --> 02:48:07,489
It was his natural right, and the violence
was much more exciting than the sexual act

2278
02:48:07,489 --> 02:48:09,449
itself.

2279
02:48:09,449 --> 02:48:11,109
But Pelagia fought.

2280
02:48:11,109 --> 02:48:17,739
Her nails broke in his flesh, she struck him
with hands and knees and elbows, she screamed

2281
02:48:17,739 --> 02:48:19,630
and struggled.

2282
02:48:19,630 --> 02:48:25,700
To Mandras her resistance was unreasonable,
he was failing despite his weight and strength,

2283
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:28,859
and he sat back and hit her repeatedly.

2284
02:48:28,859 --> 02:48:31,539
Then suddenly he tried to pull up her skirts.

2285
02:48:31,539 --> 02:48:38,290
The solid weight of her gun fell out of its
pocket and landed beside her head on the pillow,

2286
02:48:38,290 --> 02:48:43,870
but Mandras did not see it, and when the bullet
cracked through his shoulder, the shock knocked

2287
02:48:43,870 --> 02:48:49,439
him backwards and he gazed at Pelagia in shock
and accusation.

2288
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:54,699
Drosoula heard the crack of the gunshot just
as she came through the kitchen door and at

2289
02:48:54,699 --> 02:49:00,829
first she did not recognize the sound, but
then she knew what it was and took the Italian

2290
02:49:00,829 --> 02:49:03,069
gun from the drawer.

2291
02:49:03,069 --> 02:49:08,029
Without thinking, knowing that thought would
make her a coward, she pushed open the door

2292
02:49:08,029 --> 02:49:13,199
of Pelagia's room and saw there the unthinkable.

2293
02:49:13,199 --> 02:49:18,199
She had thought that Pelagia might have shot
herself, that there might be thieves, but

2294
02:49:18,199 --> 02:49:24,029
when she burst in, she saw the doctor's daughter
leaning up on her elbow, her face swollen

2295
02:49:24,029 --> 02:49:28,569
and bloody, her lips split, her clothes torn.

2296
02:49:28,569 --> 02:49:34,029
Drosoula followed Pelagia's gaze and saw,
leaning against the wall behind the door,

2297
02:49:34,029 --> 02:49:37,590
a man who might have been her son.

2298
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:43,979
She ran to Pelagia's side and took her into
her arms, rocking her, and heard the words,

2299
02:49:43,979 --> 02:49:48,899
'He... tried ... to... rape me.'

2300
02:49:48,899 --> 02:49:54,199
Drosoula stood up, and mother and son examined
each other in disbelief.

2301
02:49:54,199 --> 02:49:56,359
So much had changed.

2302
02:49:56,359 --> 02:50:02,020
As the anger grew in the woman, the fire in
Mandras died.

2303
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:09,479
A wave of self-pity overcame him and all he
wanted to do was weep; everything had come

2304
02:50:09,479 --> 02:50:13,289
to nothing, everything was lost.

2305
02:50:13,289 --> 02:50:19,720
The horror of the war in Albania, the years
in the forest, his new power and importance,

2306
02:50:19,720 --> 02:50:26,539
it was all a dream, and he was a frightened
little boy again, trembling before the anger

2307
02:50:26,539 --> 02:50:28,369
of his mother.

2308
02:50:28,369 --> 02:50:31,369
And his shoulder hurt so much.

2309
02:50:31,369 --> 02:50:34,529
He wanted to show it to her, to win her attention.

2310
02:50:34,529 --> 02:50:37,479
He wanted her to touch and heal it.

2311
02:50:37,479 --> 02:50:45,899
But she pointed the gun at him and spat the
one word that seemed to mean the most, 'Fascist'.

2312
02:50:45,899 --> 02:50:50,640
'Mother...' he said in a voice that was low
and frightened.

2313
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:53,069
'How dare you call me "mother"?

2314
02:50:53,069 --> 02:50:57,979
I am no mother and you are not my son.

2315
02:50:57,979 --> 02:51:00,069
I have a daughter...'

2316
02:51:00,069 --> 02:51:05,300
she pointed to Pelagia, who had curled into
a ball, '... and this is what you do.

2317
02:51:05,300 --> 02:51:12,609
I do not know you, never in my life do I want
to see you again, I have forgotten you, my

2318
02:51:12,609 --> 02:51:14,239
curse goes with you.

2319
02:51:14,239 --> 02:51:21,739
May you never know peace, may your heart burst
in your chest, may you die alone,' She spat

2320
02:51:21,739 --> 02:51:25,040
on the ground and shook her head with disgust.

2321
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:30,300
'Pig rapist, get out before I kill you.'

2322
02:51:30,300 --> 02:51:35,060
Mandras left his gun leaning against the wall
of the kitchen, and with bright red blood

2323
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:40,840
on his right hand where he still held his
wound, he stumbled out into the cold December

2324
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:42,090
sun.

2325
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:47,090
He looked through tearful eyes at the tree
where once he had swung and laughed, and where,

2326
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:51,869
he seemed to remember, there had once been
a goat.

2327
02:51:51,869 --> 02:51:57,529
It was a tree that was incomplete without
Pelagia as she was, fresh and beautiful, slicing

2328
02:51:57,529 --> 02:52:01,430
onions beneath it and smiling through the
tears.

2329
02:52:01,430 --> 02:52:07,300
A wave of grief overcame him and his throat
tightened with sorrow.

2330
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:13,869
It did not occur to him that he was just one
more life twisted and ruined by the war.

2331
02:52:13,869 --> 02:52:21,149
He was aware only that heaven had disappeared,
that hope had turned to dust, that joy, which

2332
02:52:21,149 --> 02:52:26,380
had once shone brighter than the summer sun,
had disappeared into the black light and cold

2333
02:52:26,380 --> 02:52:28,920
heat of mass murder.

2334
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:36,289
He had struggled for a better world and instead
had destroyed it.

2335
02:52:36,289 --> 02:52:41,689
There was once a place where all had shone
with delight and innocence.

2336
02:52:41,689 --> 02:52:48,609
He stood still for a moment, recalling where
it was; then he went down to the sea, stood

2337
02:52:48,609 --> 02:52:52,739
on the waterline, and kicked off his boots.

2338
02:52:52,739 --> 02:52:58,180
With his right hand he slowly removed his
clothes till he stood with nothing on.

2339
02:52:58,180 --> 02:53:03,510
He realized he wanted only to feel the sea
and sand upon his skin.

2340
02:53:03,510 --> 02:53:05,939
He needed to be washed.

2341
02:53:05,939 --> 02:53:12,069
He remembered days in his boat with nothing
to do except fish; he remembered his joy when

2342
02:53:12,069 --> 02:53:17,970
something fine was landed for Pelagia, his
pleasure at her pleasure when he gave it to

2343
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:19,609
her.

2344
02:53:19,609 --> 02:53:23,629
He remembered that in those days he was beautiful.

2345
02:53:23,629 --> 02:53:30,140
He began walking into the sea that would take
his life, and by drowning him make him clean,

2346
02:53:30,140 --> 02:53:38,039
make him pure and innocent once more.

2347
02:53:38,039 --> 02:53:40,500
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Antonia

2348
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:48,359
There had been so many rapes that Pelagia
and Drosoula were not surprised to find an

2349
02:53:48,359 --> 02:53:51,270
abandoned bundle on their doorstep.

2350
02:53:51,270 --> 02:53:56,560
It had been born at a time when its father
could have been a German or a Communist, and

2351
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:00,779
the mother might have been any unfortunate
girl at all.

2352
02:54:00,779 --> 02:54:05,810
Whoever this sorrowing and dishonoured girl
had been, she had cared enough about her child

2353
02:54:05,810 --> 02:54:10,510
to leave it upon the doorstep of a doctors
house, knowing that those inside would be

2354
02:54:10,510 --> 02:54:11,859
able to cope.

2355
02:54:11,859 --> 02:54:18,550
The disorder of the times was so great that
the two women could think of no solution except

2356
02:54:18,550 --> 02:54:24,050
to try and care for it themselves, thinking
that in time the child could be adopted by

2357
02:54:24,050 --> 02:54:30,310
someone childless or handed to a charitable
organization.

2358
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:35,909
They had taken the child inside and unwrapped
it and discovered that it was a girl.

2359
02:54:35,909 --> 02:54:40,449
She was very calm and cried only a little.

2360
02:54:40,449 --> 02:54:46,229
She sucked the thumb of her right hand (a
habit she never lost, even in old age), and

2361
02:54:46,229 --> 02:54:52,709
she smiled a lot, her legs and arms waving
up and down in delight.

2362
02:54:52,709 --> 02:54:57,890
The two women, who had suffered so greatly
from loss and unhappiness, found that the

2363
02:54:57,890 --> 02:55:04,060
child, whom they named Antonia, gave new meaning
to their lives.

2364
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:09,399
Because of her, the women's tragic memories
began to fade, and she took her place in their

2365
02:55:09,399 --> 02:55:14,040
lives as if she had always been meant to be
there.

2366
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:19,800
In all her life, Antonia never asked a question
about her father, and only when she applied

2367
02:55:19,800 --> 02:55:27,069
for a passport to go abroad did she discover
that she did not officially exist.

2368
02:55:27,069 --> 02:55:29,760
She did have a grandfather, however.

2369
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:36,180
When Dr Iannis returned after two years, stumbling
into the kitchen supported by two charity

2370
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:42,279
workers, utterly broken by his treatment in
the prison camp and forever speechless, he

2371
02:55:42,279 --> 02:55:48,489
bent down and kissed the child before retiring
to his room.

2372
02:55:48,489 --> 02:55:56,070
Just as Antonia did not enquire about a father,
Dr Iannis did not enquire about the child.

2373
02:55:56,070 --> 02:56:01,720
It was enough for him to know that the world
had gone down a path that he had no hope of

2374
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:02,770
understanding.

2375
02:56:02,770 --> 02:56:07,949
He accepted that his daughter and Drosoula
would sleep in his bed, and that he would

2376
02:56:07,949 --> 02:56:14,319
take Pelagia's, because, whichever bed it
was, he would dream the same dreams of a forced

2377
02:56:14,319 --> 02:56:20,430
march of hundreds of kilometres without his
boots, without food or water.

2378
02:56:20,430 --> 02:56:26,229
He would hear the cries of villagers as their
houses burned, the crack of gunshots as they

2379
02:56:26,229 --> 02:56:32,859
were murdered, and he would witness, over
and over again, Stamatis and Kokolios dying

2380
02:56:32,859 --> 02:56:41,080
in each other's arms and begging him to leave
them in the road in case he himself was shot.

2381
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:46,810
In his wordlessness, Dr Iannis drew the same
comfort from Antonia that he had drawn from

2382
02:56:46,810 --> 02:56:50,840
his daughter after his own young wife had
died.

2383
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:56,609
He would put the child upon his knee, arranging
her black hair, gazing into her brown eyes

2384
02:56:56,609 --> 02:57:02,840
as if this alone was the way to speak, her
smile filling his heart with sorrow, because

2385
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:08,529
when she was old she would lose her innocence,
and learn that tragedy destroys the muscles

2386
02:57:08,529 --> 02:57:12,999
of the face until a smile becomes impossible.

2387
02:57:12,999 --> 02:57:21,220
In 1949 the national government succeeded
at last in defeating the Communists, who lost

2388
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:23,970
their control of the country.

2389
02:57:23,970 --> 02:57:29,569
Dr Iannis took up medicine again, helping
his daughter in a reversal of their roles.

2390
02:57:29,569 --> 02:57:34,909
It upset Pelagia to see the shaking of his
hands as he dealt with patients' wounds, and

2391
02:57:34,909 --> 02:57:39,439
she knew also that he worked despite a terrible
sense of uselessness.

2392
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:46,510
Why preserve life when all of us must die,
when health is only an accident of youth?

2393
02:57:46,510 --> 02:57:52,550
She wondered sometimes at the strength of
his desire to heal, despite all he had suffered.

2394
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:57,830
In the evening she wrapped her arms around
him and held him as his mind wandered back

2395
02:57:57,830 --> 02:58:04,800
over the past, his eyes wet with sadness,
and she buried her head on his chest, understanding

2396
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:10,520
that by comforting him she was comforting
herself too.

2397
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:15,170
She attempted to interest him in working on
his History, and when she took the papers

2398
02:58:15,170 --> 02:58:19,930
from the hiding-hole and arranged them in
front of him at his table, he seemed willing

2399
02:58:19,930 --> 02:58:21,699
enough to work.

2400
02:58:21,699 --> 02:58:27,729
He read through them, but at the end of a
week Pelagia found he had added only one short

2401
02:58:27,729 --> 02:58:34,369
paragraph in a shaky handwriting that did
not look like his old, firm handwriting at

2402
02:58:34,369 --> 02:58:35,369
all.

2403
02:58:35,369 --> 02:58:40,899
Then she saw that across the bottom of the
last page her father had written, 'In the

2404
02:58:40,899 --> 02:58:44,199
past the horrors came from outside.

2405
02:58:44,199 --> 02:58:49,619
Now we have only ourselves to blame.'

2406
02:58:49,619 --> 02:58:55,140
While she had been in the hiding-hole, Pelagia
had rediscovered Antonio's mandolin and Carlo's

2407
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:56,649
papers.

2408
02:58:56,649 --> 02:59:02,729
She read through the latter in a single evening
and was astonished; she had never imagined

2409
02:59:02,729 --> 02:59:08,800
that that powerful, good-natured man had suffered
so greatly from a secret sadness that had

2410
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:11,749
made him a stranger to himself.

2411
02:59:11,749 --> 02:59:17,329
She saw that he had been as determined to
lose his life as he had been to save Corelli's

2412
02:59:17,329 --> 02:59:23,790
and she realized that if her own adopted child
was at risk, she would find the same extraordinary

2413
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:27,170
courage in herself.

2414
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:32,699
Antonia grew tall and lovely, a child whose
movements were filled with confidence and

2415
02:59:32,699 --> 02:59:33,859
grace.

2416
02:59:33,859 --> 02:59:40,100
She was incapable of behaving like a 'lady',
and when she sat in her grandfather's armchair

2417
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:46,140
she not only sucked her thumb but also hung
one leg over the arm of the chair, ignoring

2418
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:53,529
her mother's and Drosoula's protests with
laughing cries of, 'Don't be so old-fashioned.'

2419
02:59:53,529 --> 02:59:56,379
The family were regarded as eccentric.

2420
02:59:56,379 --> 03:00:02,899
The empty-headed gossips of the village regarded
Drosoula, with her extreme ugliness, and Pelagia,

2421
03:00:02,899 --> 03:00:07,699
with her assumption that she was any man's
equal, as a pair of crazy women.

2422
03:00:07,699 --> 03:00:13,459
Children threw stones at them as they passed,
and adults warned their children to keep away

2423
03:00:13,459 --> 03:00:15,930
and encouraged their dogs to bite them.

2424
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:22,399
Nevertheless, Pelagia earned a living, because
after darkness people would arrive secretly

2425
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:26,460
in the belief that her treatments were sure
to work.

2426
03:00:26,460 --> 03:00:34,030
During all this time Pelagia became certain
that Antonio Corelli was dead and, like her

2427
03:00:34,030 --> 03:00:40,500
father, she also became certain beyond doubt
of the reality of ghosts.

2428
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:47,129
It had happened first in 1946 when, one day
in October, she was standing outside the house

2429
03:00:47,129 --> 03:00:50,229
with the infant Antonia in her arms.

2430
03:00:50,229 --> 03:00:55,680
She was making baby noises and giving the
baby her finger to suck, when something made

2431
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:57,449
her look up.

2432
03:00:57,449 --> 03:01:02,970
She saw a figure dressed in black, standing
before her in exactly the same place that

2433
03:01:02,970 --> 03:01:07,840
Mandras had been when he had been shot by
Velisarios' cannon.

2434
03:01:07,840 --> 03:01:13,939
The figure was looking at her, as if it wanted
to take a step towards her, and her heart

2435
03:01:13,939 --> 03:01:14,939
leapt.

2436
03:01:14,939 --> 03:01:20,279
There was an atmosphere around him of nine
thousand weeping ghosts, and sorrow seemed

2437
03:01:20,279 --> 03:01:22,949
to pour from his face.

2438
03:01:22,949 --> 03:01:28,399
Thin and bearded though he was, she was sure
it was him.

2439
03:01:28,399 --> 03:01:34,770
Excited beyond all joy, she put the baby down
in order to run to him, but when she looked

2440
03:01:34,770 --> 03:01:38,270
up he had gone.

2441
03:01:38,270 --> 03:01:41,390
Her heart jumping in her chest, she ran.

2442
03:01:41,390 --> 03:01:46,350
Around the bend she stopped and looked wildly
around, crying out, 'Antonio!

2443
03:01:46,350 --> 03:01:47,350
Antonio!'

2444
03:01:47,350 --> 03:01:52,529
But no voice responded and no man came towards
her.

2445
03:01:52,529 --> 03:01:54,340
He had disappeared.

2446
03:01:54,340 --> 03:02:00,060
Her hands rose to the sky in confusion and
fell down again to her sides.

2447
03:02:00,060 --> 03:02:05,499
She stood watching and calling until her shouts
hurt her throat and tears blinded her eyes.

2448
03:02:05,499 --> 03:02:13,180
The same ghost appeared at the same place
in 1947 and every year after that at roughly

2449
03:02:13,180 --> 03:02:16,920
the same time, but never exactly.

2450
03:02:16,920 --> 03:02:22,459
It was because of this that Pelagia came to
the conclusion that Antonio had kept his promise

2451
03:02:22,459 --> 03:02:28,959
to return and that it was possible to keep
such a promise and continue to love even from

2452
03:02:28,959 --> 03:02:31,220
beyond the grave.

2453
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:36,579
She was able to live satisfied, knowing that
she had not been abandoned, and, filled with

2454
03:02:36,579 --> 03:02:42,350
happy dreams of being desired and loved, she
looked forward to her own death when she would

2455
03:02:42,350 --> 03:02:49,750
once again have all that had been stolen away
in life.

2456
03:02:49,750 --> 03:02:56,119
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
1953: Earthquake

2457
03:02:56,119 --> 03:03:02,430
The thirteenth of August, 1953 was a fine
day, with small white clouds scattered here

2458
03:03:02,430 --> 03:03:06,739
and there most charmingly in the deep blue
sky.

2459
03:03:06,739 --> 03:03:12,859
That morning Antonia, now eight years old
but as tall as a child of twelve, went to

2460
03:03:12,859 --> 03:03:18,180
pick up a sheet of paper from the floor, and
when the sheet flew upwards and stuck to her

2461
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:25,260
hand, she cried, 'It's magic,' and ran excitedly
outside.

2462
03:03:25,260 --> 03:03:29,040
Strange things were happening all over the
Ionian islands.

2463
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:35,420
There were no birds in the sky; on the hillsides
and in the undergrowth, snakes and rats left

2464
03:03:35,420 --> 03:03:40,680
their holes, and in the villages all the dogs
began barking.

2465
03:03:40,680 --> 03:03:48,649
Drosoula came inside sweating and shaking
and told Pelagia, 'I am ill, I feel terrible,

2466
03:03:48,649 --> 03:03:51,000
something has happened to my heart.'

2467
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:56,840
She sat down heavily with her hand to her
chest, taking deep breaths, and Pelagia went

2468
03:03:56,840 --> 03:03:59,779
to her medicine cupboard and made a drink
for her.

2469
03:03:59,779 --> 03:04:07,250
Antonia, who had come back inside, suddenly
burst into tears, exclaimed, 'Mama, I've got

2470
03:04:07,250 --> 03:04:10,039
to get out,' and ran outdoors.

2471
03:04:10,039 --> 03:04:17,749
Drosoula and Pelagia were exchanging surprised
glances when suddenly there came a low, terrible

2472
03:04:17,749 --> 03:04:22,260
roar from the earth that made the two women
feel as if their hearts were exploding in

2473
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:23,420
their chests.

2474
03:04:23,420 --> 03:04:29,140
'A heart attack,' thought Pelagia desperately,
and she saw Drosoula, with her hands on her

2475
03:04:29,140 --> 03:04:35,189
stomach and her eyes staring, stumble as if
someone had struck her.

2476
03:04:35,189 --> 03:04:42,319
It seemed that time had stopped and the indescribable
roaring of the earth would never end.

2477
03:04:42,319 --> 03:04:47,470
Dr Iannis rushed out of the room that used
to be Pelagia's and spoke for the first time

2478
03:04:47,470 --> 03:04:48,470
in years.

2479
03:04:48,470 --> 03:04:50,000
'Get out!

2480
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,439
Get out!' he cried.

2481
03:04:52,439 --> 03:04:54,850
'It's an earthquake!

2482
03:04:54,850 --> 03:04:56,720
Save yourselves!'

2483
03:04:56,720 --> 03:05:03,300
His voice sounded small and far away, and
immediately afterwards he was thrown violently

2484
03:05:03,300 --> 03:05:05,180
sideways.

2485
03:05:05,180 --> 03:05:09,800
More frightened than they had ever been in
their lives, the two women stumbled towards

2486
03:05:09,800 --> 03:05:13,409
the door, were thrown down and attempted to
crawl.

2487
03:05:13,409 --> 03:05:19,069
But again and again they were thrown upwards
and sideways and, unable to crawl on their

2488
03:05:19,069 --> 03:05:25,220
hands and knees, they spread their hands and
legs and moved towards the door like snakes,

2489
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:30,590
reaching it just as the roof began to fall
in.

2490
03:05:30,590 --> 03:05:36,499
Outside in the yard dust was slowly rising
as the earth went up and down, while in the

2491
03:05:36,499 --> 03:05:42,720
centre of the street a stream of water suddenly
rose to a height of twelve metres and then

2492
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:46,010
disappeared as if it had never been.

2493
03:05:46,010 --> 03:05:52,590
Houses suddenly leapt upwards and solid stone
walls moved like paper in the wind, and then

2494
03:05:52,590 --> 03:05:57,539
suddenly there was a stillness like that of
death.

2495
03:05:57,539 --> 03:06:05,020
Pelagia, spitting and covered in dirt, filled
with a sense of utter helplessness, began

2496
03:06:05,020 --> 03:06:07,840
to struggle to her knees.

2497
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:13,020
Suddenly the strange silence was broken by
the wild cries of the priest, who rushed from

2498
03:06:13,020 --> 03:06:15,369
the church with his arms raised to heaven.

2499
03:06:15,369 --> 03:06:16,739
'You pig!' he roared.

2500
03:06:16,739 --> 03:06:18,430
'You evil dog!'

2501
03:06:18,430 --> 03:06:27,830
He fell to his knees and, with tears in his
eyes, struck at the earth with his fists.

2502
03:06:27,830 --> 03:06:35,449
At this point, as if in response to his cries,
the terrible roaring began again and once

2503
03:06:35,449 --> 03:06:41,419
more the Cephallonian earth danced, the peaks
of the mountains rocking like boats.

2504
03:06:41,419 --> 03:06:48,520
During those intervals when the motion stopped,
Pelagia, Drosoula and Antonia held tightly

2505
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:53,739
on to each other, gazing in horror at the
old house, of which there was little left.

2506
03:06:53,739 --> 03:07:00,579
The walls were reduced to half their height
and the roof lay in ruins on the floor.

2507
03:07:00,579 --> 03:07:06,249
This ruin contained the sad soul and tired
old body of the doctor, who had planned his

2508
03:07:06,249 --> 03:07:15,039
last words for years and now died beneath
the stones without the chance to say them.

2509
03:07:15,039 --> 03:07:16,039
***

2510
03:07:16,039 --> 03:07:22,119
The British were the first to arrive, sending
four large ships carrying water, food, medicines,

2511
03:07:22,119 --> 03:07:24,250
doctors and rescue equipment.

2512
03:07:24,250 --> 03:07:30,109
Italy, remembering its shameful past, sent
ships loaded with rescue workers, and American

2513
03:07:30,109 --> 03:07:36,020
ships arrived carrying earthmovers, helicopters
and 3,000 sailors.

2514
03:07:36,020 --> 03:07:41,699
The Greek Navy turned up late but eager, and
the King of Greece and his family travelled

2515
03:07:41,699 --> 03:07:43,990
around the islands.

2516
03:07:43,990 --> 03:07:48,939
The earthmovers began the slow work of clearing
the ruined houses, and foreign aid workers

2517
03:07:48,939 --> 03:07:53,529
built cities of tents as temporary accommodation
for the islanders.

2518
03:07:53,529 --> 03:07:58,890
Aeroplanes and helicopters dropped food to
hillside communities whose roads had been

2519
03:07:58,890 --> 03:08:01,039
cut off by the earthquake.

2520
03:08:01,039 --> 03:08:06,590
In Cephallonia, because of the wide streets
and the fact that most buildings were only

2521
03:08:06,590 --> 03:08:11,260
one storey high, few people actually died
in the earthquake.

2522
03:08:11,260 --> 03:08:16,659
There were the usual stories concerning people
who had lost their sense of time and appeared

2523
03:08:16,659 --> 03:08:22,619
from beneath the ruins of houses after nine
days, believing it had been a few hours.

2524
03:08:22,619 --> 03:08:27,390
The islanders reacted differently, according
to whether or not they found a natural leader

2525
03:08:27,390 --> 03:08:28,470
among themselves.

2526
03:08:28,470 --> 03:08:35,260
Where none appeared, people became sad and
purposeless and had terrible dreams of falling

2527
03:08:35,260 --> 03:08:37,189
into endless space.

2528
03:08:37,189 --> 03:08:43,590
During the earthquake itself perhaps a quarter
of the islanders, like the doctor, had remained

2529
03:08:43,590 --> 03:08:50,319
calm, but afterwards the remaining three-quarters
suffered terrible shame remembering the way

2530
03:08:50,319 --> 03:08:54,950
they had abandoned their children and elderly
parents.

2531
03:08:54,950 --> 03:09:00,779
Although he had always been considered a slow-thinking
man, Velisarios, who was now forty-two years

2532
03:09:00,779 --> 03:09:06,850
old and stronger than he had ever been, took
command in Pelagia's village.

2533
03:09:06,850 --> 03:09:11,260
With a strength that seemed greater than that
of the earthquake itself, he threw off the

2534
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:16,319
beams and stones that imprisoned the crushed
body of the doctor, because he was aware that

2535
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:20,449
decay was followed by disease.

2536
03:09:20,449 --> 03:09:25,359
Then he gathered together the confused and
hopeless villagers and ordered them into small

2537
03:09:25,359 --> 03:09:27,859
working parties.

2538
03:09:27,859 --> 03:09:33,089
For months after the earthquake, there were
times when the earth would shake and tremble,

2539
03:09:33,089 --> 03:09:39,819
not violently as it had done in the earthquake
itself, but enough to make people scream in

2540
03:09:39,819 --> 03:09:40,819
fear.

2541
03:09:40,819 --> 03:09:46,090
It was Velisarios who told people to get back
to work, threatening them with broken bones

2542
03:09:46,090 --> 03:09:48,669
unless they returned to their tasks.

2543
03:09:48,669 --> 03:09:55,489
Even Pelagia, who was almost crazy with grief,
was given the work of caring for people's

2544
03:09:55,489 --> 03:10:01,689
wounds, while Drosoula, who at first could
only cry, was put in charge of the children

2545
03:10:01,689 --> 03:10:04,999
so that their parents could work.

2546
03:10:04,999 --> 03:10:09,420
When the aid workers finally arrived at the
village, they found a small community living

2547
03:10:09,420 --> 03:10:16,659
in tents made of sheets of iron, with toilets
dug at a safe distance from the water supply.

2548
03:10:16,659 --> 03:10:22,199
An enormous man was in charge, who in old
age would be more loved and respected than

2549
03:10:22,199 --> 03:10:24,470
the teacher or the priest.

2550
03:10:24,470 --> 03:10:29,459
For three months the earth moved, as if it
was breathing.

2551
03:10:29,459 --> 03:10:36,380
Then, at last, it became quiet and motionless
once again, and reconstruction began, to be

2552
03:10:36,380 --> 03:10:38,770
completed three years later.

2553
03:10:38,770 --> 03:10:45,359
Ancient and beautiful Italian towns were rebuilt
as plain white boxes.

2554
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:51,089
Pelagias village was put up further down the
hill and her old house was abandoned, the

2555
03:10:51,089 --> 03:10:57,390
contents of the hiding-hole in the kitchen
buried, it seemed, forever.

2556
03:10:57,390 --> 03:11:03,289
The earthquake changed lives so greatly that,
even today, it is still the most important

2557
03:11:03,289 --> 03:11:06,930
topic of conversation in Cephallonia.

2558
03:11:06,930 --> 03:11:12,029
Islanders cannot resist informing strangers
of the facts, and tourist guides will mention

2559
03:11:12,029 --> 03:11:17,249
the earthquake when it seemed they were only
going to discuss the weather.

2560
03:11:17,249 --> 03:11:23,890
Old people remember an event according to
whether it was before or after the earthquake.

2561
03:11:23,890 --> 03:11:29,489
The disaster caused people to recall the war
as unimportant by comparison, and they woke

2562
03:11:29,489 --> 03:11:34,810
up each morning amazed and grateful to be
alive.

2563
03:11:34,810 --> 03:11:40,749
In the new house that Pelagia, Drosoula and
Antonia now lived in, Pelagia's guilt was

2564
03:11:40,749 --> 03:11:45,989
the central issue in the three women's lives;
the thought that she had played a part in

2565
03:11:45,989 --> 03:11:49,699
her father's death made Pelagia suffer horribly.

2566
03:11:49,699 --> 03:11:53,709
'He was seventy,' said Drosoula sensibly.

2567
03:11:53,709 --> 03:11:58,350
'It was better to die quickly like that, trying
to save us.'

2568
03:11:58,350 --> 03:12:01,979
But Pelagia could not accept this.

2569
03:12:01,979 --> 03:12:07,339
She knew that in the moment of disaster, her
mind had been spinning with nothing except

2570
03:12:07,339 --> 03:12:13,119
the need to save herself, and she knew that
when her father had fallen she should have

2571
03:12:13,119 --> 03:12:18,409
tried, even at the risk of her own life, to
drag him through the door before the roof

2572
03:12:18,409 --> 03:12:20,089
fell in.

2573
03:12:20,089 --> 03:12:26,279
She fell into a bottomless pit of self-blame,
took no interest in her appearance and did

2574
03:12:26,279 --> 03:12:32,050
not perform her household tasks, preferring
to sit by the doctor's grave, chewing her

2575
03:12:32,050 --> 03:12:35,199
lips until they bled.

2576
03:12:35,199 --> 03:12:42,479
With her untidy greying hair and her pale
face, she simply sat and watched, as if expecting

2577
03:12:42,479 --> 03:12:47,500
his ghost to rise up through the earth and
speak to her.

2578
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:53,959
Time after time, in the winter storms and
rams, Drosoula and Antonia would go to the

2579
03:12:53,959 --> 03:13:01,069
grave and drag Pelagia away, while she sighed
and wept.

2580
03:13:01,069 --> 03:13:09,369
One day Antonia and Drosoula could stand no
more; they began to feel impatient and angry,

2581
03:13:09,369 --> 03:13:14,439
and the old woman and the young girl discussed
how they could cure Pelagia of her sorrow.

2582
03:13:14,439 --> 03:13:18,540
'Why don't we just tie her to the bed and
hit her?'

2583
03:13:18,540 --> 03:13:21,010
suggested Antonia.

2584
03:13:21,010 --> 03:13:25,579
Drosoula sighed with pleasure at the thought
and for a moment wondered whether or not it

2585
03:13:25,579 --> 03:13:27,280
would work.

2586
03:13:27,280 --> 03:13:32,119
Then her eyes brightened and she kissed the
young girl on the top of her forehead.

2587
03:13:32,119 --> 03:13:34,789
'I've had an idea,' she said.

2588
03:13:34,789 --> 03:13:42,449
At breakfast the next morning, Antonia suddenly
announced, 'I had a dream about Granddad last

2589
03:13:42,449 --> 03:13:43,449
night.'

2590
03:13:43,449 --> 03:13:46,689
'That's funny,' said Drosoula, 'so did I.'

2591
03:13:46,689 --> 03:13:52,350
They looked at Pelagia for some kind of reaction,
but she simply continued to tear a piece of

2592
03:13:52,350 --> 03:13:54,310
bread into tiny pieces.

2593
03:13:54,310 --> 03:14:00,729
'He told me he was glad he was dead,' said
Antonia, 'because now he can be with Mama's

2594
03:14:00,729 --> 03:14:01,729
mother.'

2595
03:14:01,729 --> 03:14:08,770
'That's not what he told me,' replied Drosoula,
and Pelagia asked, 'Why are you talking as

2596
03:14:08,770 --> 03:14:10,800
if I'm not here?'

2597
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:13,850
'Because you're not,' replied Drosoula truthfully.

2598
03:14:13,850 --> 03:14:16,979
'You haven't been here for a long time.'

2599
03:14:16,979 --> 03:14:19,569
'What did he tell you then?'

2600
03:14:19,569 --> 03:14:20,779
enquired Antonia.

2601
03:14:20,779 --> 03:14:26,289
'He told me that he wants Mama to write the
History of Cephallonia that got buried in

2602
03:14:26,289 --> 03:14:27,619
the earthquake.

2603
03:14:27,619 --> 03:14:33,289
He said it spoils the fun of being dead, knowing
that it's got lost.'

2604
03:14:33,289 --> 03:14:39,720
Pelagia regarded them suspiciously and Antonia
asked her innocently, 'So are you going to

2605
03:14:39,720 --> 03:14:40,720
write it?'

2606
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:44,050
'There's no point in asking her,' said Drosoula.

2607
03:14:44,050 --> 03:14:45,800
'She's on another planet.'

2608
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:49,789
'That's not true,' protested Pelagia.

2609
03:14:49,789 --> 03:14:53,729
'Welcome back,' said Drosoula rudely.

2610
03:14:53,729 --> 03:15:00,200
Pelagia went back to her father's grave and
thought about what Drosoula had said; although

2611
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:05,879
she knew that the story of the dream was nonsense,
it occurred to her that rewriting the History

2612
03:15:05,879 --> 03:15:10,390
would indeed be a way to keep her father's
spirit alive.

2613
03:15:10,390 --> 03:15:16,619
She travelled into Argostoli and returned
with pens and a thick pad of paper.

2614
03:15:16,619 --> 03:15:19,410
It was surprisingly easy.

2615
03:15:19,410 --> 03:15:24,129
Although the History had been destroyed in
the earthquake, she had read it so many times

2616
03:15:24,129 --> 03:15:29,770
that the old phrases rolled through the kitchen
door and flowed down her arm and right hand

2617
03:15:29,770 --> 03:15:31,710
into her pen:

2618
03:15:31,710 --> 03:15:39,930
'The ancient, half-forgotten island of Cephallonia
rises from the Ionian Sea...'

2619
03:15:39,930 --> 03:15:45,739
Drosoula and Antonia spied on her as she sat
at her table, tapping her teeth with her pen.

2620
03:15:45,739 --> 03:15:52,539
They crept away to a safe distance, embraced
each other and danced.

2621
03:15:52,539 --> 03:15:56,069
Pelagia almost became the doctor.

2622
03:15:56,069 --> 03:16:00,510
She did hardly any housework, leaving it all
to the women.

2623
03:16:00,510 --> 03:16:05,140
Her father's pipe had been found in the ruins
of the old house, and she stuck it between

2624
03:16:05,140 --> 03:16:09,340
her teeth as he had done, but did not light
it.

2625
03:16:09,340 --> 03:16:14,819
She began to add small details to the text
that she remembered so well, supplying information

2626
03:16:14,819 --> 03:16:20,720
about such matters as clothes and baking,
and the cruel but traditional treatment of

2627
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:22,210
widows.

2628
03:16:22,210 --> 03:16:25,959
The joy of the work caused a deep change in
her.

2629
03:16:25,959 --> 03:16:30,659
She sent letters of enquiry to universities
and discovered that all over the world there

2630
03:16:30,659 --> 03:16:35,220
were people who loved knowledge so much that
they would spend months making enquiries on

2631
03:16:35,220 --> 03:16:36,850
her behalf.

2632
03:16:36,850 --> 03:16:44,479
Finally, at the end of 1961, she put her completed
work into an enormous file and wondered what

2633
03:16:44,479 --> 03:16:46,459
to do next.

2634
03:16:46,459 --> 03:16:51,749
She learnt from publishers that such a book
would have no market and was advised instead

2635
03:16:51,749 --> 03:16:53,410
to give it to a university.

2636
03:16:53,410 --> 03:17:00,050
'I will when I'm dead,' thought Pelagia, and
she left it proudly on her shelf as visible

2637
03:17:00,050 --> 03:17:05,649
evidence of the fact that she was an intellectual
in the tradition of the Ancient Greeks.

2638
03:17:05,649 --> 03:17:12,839
By this time Antonia was a fresh and beautiful
seventeen-year-old, who opposed her adopted

2639
03:17:12,839 --> 03:17:18,379
mother's ideas as a matter of principle, and
the two would sit up late into the night discussing

2640
03:17:18,379 --> 03:17:19,379
philosophy.

2641
03:17:19,379 --> 03:17:26,770
'When you're my age, you'll look back and
see I was right,' Pelagia would say.

2642
03:17:26,770 --> 03:17:30,810
Antonia had no intention of reaching Pelagia's
age and said so.

2643
03:17:30,810 --> 03:17:34,180
'I want to die before I'm twenty-five,' she
said.

2644
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:36,169
'I don't want to get old.

2645
03:17:36,169 --> 03:17:41,520
You old people caused all the problems and
it's us young ones who have to solve them.'

2646
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:48,770
'Enjoy your dreams,' commented Pelagia.

2647
03:17:48,770 --> 03:17:52,899
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Alexi

2648
03:17:52,899 --> 03:17:58,899
It was about this time that mysterious postcards
in rather poor Greek began to arrive from

2649
03:17:58,899 --> 03:18:01,229
all over the world.

2650
03:18:01,229 --> 03:18:05,100
From Santa Fe came one that said, 'You would
like it here.

2651
03:18:05,100 --> 03:18:07,580
All the houses are made of mud.'

2652
03:18:07,580 --> 03:18:11,470
From London: 'Mad people: terrible fog.'

2653
03:18:11,470 --> 03:18:14,539
From Madrid: 'Too hot.

2654
03:18:14,539 --> 03:18:17,020
Everyone asleep.'

2655
03:18:17,020 --> 03:18:21,310
Although Pelagia's first thought was that
her father's ghost was visiting his favourite

2656
03:18:21,310 --> 03:18:26,709
countries and was sending her communications
from beyond the grave, her second thought

2657
03:18:26,709 --> 03:18:29,720
was that they might be from Antonio.

2658
03:18:29,720 --> 03:18:31,609
But he too was dead.

2659
03:18:31,609 --> 03:18:37,430
Perhaps, she thought, these unsigned cards
were from someone with whom she had exchanged

2660
03:18:37,430 --> 03:18:40,119
letters during the writing of the History.

2661
03:18:40,119 --> 03:18:47,119
Puzzled but pleased, she tied her collections
of cards together and put them in a box.

2662
03:18:47,119 --> 03:18:52,680
'You've got a secret boyfriend,' suggested
Antonia, who was pleased to discuss the matter

2663
03:18:52,680 --> 03:18:58,510
since it drew attention away from her own
romantic affairs, which both Pelagia and Drosoula

2664
03:18:58,510 --> 03:19:00,510
were attempting to discourage.

2665
03:19:00,510 --> 03:19:06,359
They had met while Antonia was earning a little
money by serving coffee in a cafe on the plaza

2666
03:19:06,359 --> 03:19:07,680
of Argostoli.

2667
03:19:07,680 --> 03:19:13,870
There had been a noisy band playing in the
square, and the gentleman who had had to rise

2668
03:19:13,870 --> 03:19:19,890
and shout his order in the young girl's ear
had at the same moment realized what a deliciously

2669
03:19:19,890 --> 03:19:23,100
attractive ear it was.

2670
03:19:23,100 --> 03:19:28,470
Antonia had also realized that here was a
man whose eyes expressed exactly the correct

2671
03:19:28,470 --> 03:19:33,899
mixture of strength and gentleness, calmness
and humour.

2672
03:19:33,899 --> 03:19:40,330
Alexi waited at the cafe day after day, choosing
the same table whenever he could, his heart

2673
03:19:40,330 --> 03:19:47,399
bursting with his desire to see the tall young
woman with her perfect teeth and long fingers.

2674
03:19:47,399 --> 03:19:53,100
She brought him his coffee eagerly, forbidding
the other girls, the waiters, and even the

2675
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:56,260
owner himself to serve him.

2676
03:19:56,260 --> 03:20:02,640
One day he took her hand while she was putting
down a cup, looked passionately up at her

2677
03:20:02,640 --> 03:20:05,569
and said, 'Marry me.'

2678
03:20:05,569 --> 03:20:11,699
Alexi was a lawyer whose skilful speeches
could make a judge weep, but while Pelagia

2679
03:20:11,699 --> 03:20:16,409
recognized his excellence in this area, she
could not stand the thought of him marrying

2680
03:20:16,409 --> 03:20:17,479
Antonia.

2681
03:20:17,479 --> 03:20:21,310
She was very tall, he was short.

2682
03:20:21,310 --> 03:20:25,959
She was only seventeen, and he was thirty-two.

2683
03:20:25,959 --> 03:20:32,800
She was tall and graceful, he was overweight
and had a habit of tripping over things.

2684
03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:37,930
Pelagia remembered her passion for Mandras
at the same age and forbade the marriage,

2685
03:20:37,930 --> 03:20:41,109
certain that this was the right thing to do.

2686
03:20:41,109 --> 03:20:44,890
The wedding day was nevertheless delightful.

2687
03:20:44,890 --> 03:20:52,479
Antonia, beaming with happiness, kissed even
the strangers who had come to stare, and Alexi,

2688
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:58,859
sweating with alcohol and joy, made a long
and extremely poetic speech, much of it very

2689
03:20:58,859 --> 03:21:01,439
wisely in praise of his mother-in-law.

2690
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:06,420
She would always remember the exact moment
during the celebrations when she had seen

2691
03:21:06,420 --> 03:21:10,859
what it was about him that had awakened Antonia's
heart.

2692
03:21:10,859 --> 03:21:15,850
It was when he put his arm around her, kissed
her on the cheek and said, 'We are going to

2693
03:21:15,850 --> 03:21:19,510
buy a house in your village, with your permission.'

2694
03:21:19,510 --> 03:21:25,479
The humble tone of his voice and his implied
doubt that she might not want him near her

2695
03:21:25,479 --> 03:21:30,470
was enough to cause her to become extremely
fond of him.

2696
03:21:30,470 --> 03:21:37,199
While Pelagia waited impatiently for a grandchild,
Drosoula became deeply involved in work.

2697
03:21:37,199 --> 03:21:42,270
In the empty space by the harbour that had
once been her own house, she put up a wooden

2698
03:21:42,270 --> 03:21:44,770
roof and some romantic lamps.

2699
03:21:44,770 --> 03:21:51,550
She borrowed some ancient tables and chairs,
bought a cheap oven and grandly started the

2700
03:21:51,550 --> 03:21:57,819
taverna that she would run eccentrically but
with great success until the day of her death

2701
03:21:57,819 --> 03:22:01,079
in 1972.

2702
03:22:01,079 --> 03:22:07,399
It was the 1960s, and tourists were just beginning
to arrive in Cephallonia.

2703
03:22:07,399 --> 03:22:12,210
Wealthy boat owners passed on information
to their friends about the most unusual places

2704
03:22:12,210 --> 03:22:14,220
to eat.

2705
03:22:14,220 --> 03:22:19,369
German soldiers who had turned into gentle
citizens with vast families brought their

2706
03:22:19,369 --> 03:22:24,430
sons and daughters and told them, 'This is
where Daddy was in the war.

2707
03:22:24,430 --> 03:22:26,819
Isn't it beautiful?'

2708
03:22:26,819 --> 03:22:30,930
Italians arrived by ferry, bringing their
pretty white dogs.

2709
03:22:30,930 --> 03:22:36,569
Consequently, as the owner of the only taverna
in the little port, Drosoula earned enough

2710
03:22:36,569 --> 03:22:40,200
in the summer to do nothing at all in the
winter.

2711
03:22:40,200 --> 03:22:46,249
Lemoni, who was now married, immensely fat
and the mother of three children, helped with

2712
03:22:46,249 --> 03:22:52,289
the serving, and Pelagia came down, taking
the opportunity to practise her Italian.

2713
03:22:52,289 --> 03:22:58,609
The service was not fast; to tell the truth,
it was extremely slow.

2714
03:22:58,609 --> 03:23:04,310
The guests were treated unapologetically as
members of Drosoula's patient family, and

2715
03:23:04,310 --> 03:23:09,399
quite often there was no service at all if
Drosoula happened to like a particular customer

2716
03:23:09,399 --> 03:23:12,920
with whom she was deep in conversation.

2717
03:23:12,920 --> 03:23:18,210
The foreigners, who loved and feared her,
never complained about her forgetfulness and

2718
03:23:18,210 --> 03:23:24,729
her indefinite delays, and would say, 'She's
so nice, poor old thing, it seems a shame

2719
03:23:24,729 --> 03:23:26,390
to hurry her.'

2720
03:23:26,390 --> 03:23:33,680
Meanwhile, year after year, Pelagia waited
for a grandchild that never came.

2721
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:38,339
'It's my body,' declared Antonia, 'and I have
the right to choose.

2722
03:23:38,339 --> 03:23:42,199
Anyway, the world's population is already
too large.

2723
03:23:42,199 --> 03:23:46,680
Alexi agrees with me, so don't think you can
go and shout at him.'

2724
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:51,939
'I'm getting old,' Pelagia would say, 'that's
all.'

2725
03:23:51,939 --> 03:23:53,279
Time passed.

2726
03:23:53,279 --> 03:24:00,319
It was Drosoula who died first, perfectly
upright in her rocking chair, so quietly that

2727
03:24:00,319 --> 03:24:04,970
it seemed she was apologizing for having lived
at all.

2728
03:24:04,970 --> 03:24:09,339
She was a courageous woman who had lived a
few short years of happiness with a husband

2729
03:24:09,339 --> 03:24:15,319
that she had loved, a woman who had rejected
her son as a matter of principle and lived

2730
03:24:15,319 --> 03:24:20,609
the rest of her days in willing service to
her adopted family.

2731
03:24:20,609 --> 03:24:27,069
After Drosoula was buried near the doctor,
Pelagia realized that she was now truly alone.

2732
03:24:27,069 --> 03:24:32,419
She had no idea any more how to run a life,
and it was with fear and hopelessness in her

2733
03:24:32,419 --> 03:24:38,350
heart that she took over Drosoula's taverna
and attempted to make a living.

2734
03:24:38,350 --> 03:24:44,989
Alexi, who by his early thirties had lost
all his hair, achieved success as a lawyer,

2735
03:24:44,989 --> 03:24:51,189
as Pelagia had known he would, and acquired,
among other things, a big Citroen car.

2736
03:24:51,189 --> 03:24:58,669
When at last, in 1979, Antonia gave in to
the demands of nature and became pregnant,

2737
03:24:58,669 --> 03:25:05,289
she and Alexi started to hold hands again
in public, stared dreamily at babies and made

2738
03:25:05,289 --> 03:25:07,760
long lists of possible names.

2739
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:11,640
'It's going to be a girl,' said Pelagia.

2740
03:25:11,640 --> 03:25:14,669
'Really, you must call her Drosoula.'

2741
03:25:14,669 --> 03:25:17,489
'But Drosoula was so big and...'

2742
03:25:17,489 --> 03:25:18,489
'Ugly?

2743
03:25:18,489 --> 03:25:19,840
It doesn't matter.

2744
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:21,460
We loved her anyway.

2745
03:25:21,460 --> 03:25:23,319
Her name should live.'

2746
03:25:23,319 --> 03:25:25,949
'Oh, I don't know, Mama...'

2747
03:25:25,949 --> 03:25:32,459
'I am an old woman,' declared Pelagia, who
gained great satisfaction from repeating this

2748
03:25:32,459 --> 03:25:33,459
statement.

2749
03:25:33,459 --> 03:25:35,619
'It might be my last wish.'

2750
03:25:35,619 --> 03:25:37,529
'You're sixty.

2751
03:25:37,529 --> 03:25:39,050
These days that isn't old.'

2752
03:25:39,050 --> 03:25:40,499
'Well, I feel old.'

2753
03:25:40,499 --> 03:25:42,329
'You don't look it.'

2754
03:25:42,329 --> 03:25:48,149
'I didn't bring you up to be a liar,' said
Pelagia, terribly pleased, nevertheless.

2755
03:25:48,149 --> 03:25:51,439
'I'm thirty-four,' said Antonia.

2756
03:25:51,439 --> 03:25:53,660
'That's old.'

2757
03:25:53,660 --> 03:25:59,199
When the little boy appeared, Pelagia began
to refer to the child as Iannis, and she did

2758
03:25:59,199 --> 03:26:04,579
this so frequently that it soon seemed obvious
to its parents that it could not be called

2759
03:26:04,579 --> 03:26:06,899
by any other name.

2760
03:26:06,899 --> 03:26:12,910
If you called it Iannis, it smiled and blew
bubbles, so Iannis it was.

2761
03:26:12,910 --> 03:26:18,569
Alexi, now realizing that a man must pass
something on to his son, began to look around

2762
03:26:18,569 --> 03:26:20,600
for good investments.

2763
03:26:20,600 --> 03:26:25,180
He built a small block of holiday apartments
and installed a modern kitchen and toilets

2764
03:26:25,180 --> 03:26:26,939
in the taverna.

2765
03:26:26,939 --> 03:26:32,499
He persuaded Pelagia to allow him to hire
a proper cook, leaving her as the manager,

2766
03:26:32,499 --> 03:26:35,659
and they split the profits fifty-fifty.

2767
03:26:35,659 --> 03:26:41,180
On the white walls Pelagia stuck all the postcards
that continued to arrive from the four corners

2768
03:26:41,180 --> 03:26:46,159
of the world.

2769
03:26:46,159 --> 03:26:49,170
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
An Unexpected Lesson

2770
03:26:49,170 --> 03:26:56,840
At five years old, Iannis, who spent nearly
all his time at the taverna in his grandmother's

2771
03:26:56,840 --> 03:27:01,329
care, already knew how to say 'Hello' and
'Isn't he sweet?'

2772
03:27:01,329 --> 03:27:04,050
in six different languages.

2773
03:27:04,050 --> 03:27:08,510
The reason for his continual presence at the
'Taverna Drosoula' was that his father was

2774
03:27:08,510 --> 03:27:13,510
building new holiday apartments and tennis
courts and his mother was opening shops that

2775
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:16,760
sold cheap souvenirs all over the island.

2776
03:27:16,760 --> 03:27:22,550
Their son grew up contentedly in his grandmother's
company, playing in the clear waters of the

2777
03:27:22,550 --> 03:27:28,050
port and slowly learning the Italian that
Pelagia insisted on speaking to him.

2778
03:27:28,050 --> 03:27:33,590
In the evening, the reunited family would
sit together in the taverna, arguing both

2779
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:39,649
in Italian and in Greek, while Pelagia would
embarrass Iannis with references to his infant

2780
03:27:39,649 --> 03:27:41,739
years.

2781
03:27:41,739 --> 03:27:46,640
When he was ten years old, Pelagia hired a
bozouki player to entertain her guests in

2782
03:27:46,640 --> 03:27:48,229
the taverna.

2783
03:27:48,229 --> 03:27:53,979
His name was Spiridon and he played his bozouki
with such skill that he could persuade even

2784
03:27:53,979 --> 03:27:58,450
the Germans to put their arms around each
other's shoulders and dance in a circle while

2785
03:27:58,450 --> 03:28:01,029
stamping on the floor.

2786
03:28:01,029 --> 03:28:06,589
Iannis loved Spiridon, with his broad shoulders
and his wide mouth that seemed to contain

2787
03:28:06,589 --> 03:28:09,619
a hundred flashing teeth.

2788
03:28:09,619 --> 03:28:15,390
Pelagia also loved him because he reminded
her of her long-lost captain, and occasionally

2789
03:28:15,390 --> 03:28:21,109
her heart wished desperately for a time-machine
to take her back to the days of the only real

2790
03:28:21,109 --> 03:28:24,090
love of her life.

2791
03:28:24,090 --> 03:28:29,119
Iannis did not fail to notice that Spiridon
was popular with women, who at the end of

2792
03:28:29,119 --> 03:28:34,170
every performance would seize the red roses
from the vases in the middle of their tables,

2793
03:28:34,170 --> 03:28:36,430
and throw them at him.

2794
03:28:36,430 --> 03:28:42,609
So one day Iannis demanded that Spiridon should
teach him how to play the bozouki.

2795
03:28:42,609 --> 03:28:46,430
'Your arms aren't long enough yet,' said Spiro.

2796
03:28:46,430 --> 03:28:50,149
'It would make more sense to start with a
mandolin.

2797
03:28:50,149 --> 03:28:53,230
It's the same thing really, but small enough
for you.'

2798
03:28:53,230 --> 03:28:55,859
'Will you teach me to play it?'

2799
03:28:55,859 --> 03:29:00,000
'Of course, but we'll have to find a mandolin.

2800
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:05,050
Otherwise we might have to do just the theory.'

2801
03:29:05,050 --> 03:29:09,470
Iannis begged his mother and father to get
him one, and they promised to buy one when

2802
03:29:09,470 --> 03:29:12,129
they next went to Athens, but forgot.

2803
03:29:12,129 --> 03:29:19,710
Eventually Pelagia told him, 'In fact we have
one already, but it's buried under the old

2804
03:29:19,710 --> 03:29:20,710
house.

2805
03:29:20,710 --> 03:29:24,229
I am sure Antonio wouldn't mind you digging
it up.'

2806
03:29:24,229 --> 03:29:25,979
'Who's Antonio?'

2807
03:29:25,979 --> 03:29:29,419
'My Italian fiance who was killed in the war.

2808
03:29:29,419 --> 03:29:31,680
It belonged to him.

2809
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:37,899
There was a big trapdoor in the middle of
the floor and it was in a hole underneath.'

2810
03:29:37,899 --> 03:29:43,640
So Iannis dragged Spiridon up the hill and
showed him a ghostly ruin overgrown with long

2811
03:29:43,640 --> 03:29:47,819
grass, its broken stones just visible above
the growth.

2812
03:29:47,819 --> 03:29:55,020
All around it lay the silent and deserted
remains of lonely little houses.

2813
03:29:55,020 --> 03:29:57,529
'It's the saddest place,' said Iannis.

2814
03:29:57,529 --> 03:30:00,279
'I come here to explore sometimes.'

2815
03:30:00,279 --> 03:30:01,640
He pointed.

2816
03:30:01,640 --> 03:30:04,319
'My grandfather died in there.

2817
03:30:04,319 --> 03:30:06,249
I'm named after him.

2818
03:30:06,249 --> 03:30:11,050
Grandma says he was the best doctor in Greece
and that he could cure people by touching

2819
03:30:11,050 --> 03:30:12,050
them.'

2820
03:30:12,050 --> 03:30:16,789
The two of them went through what had once
been the door and scratched their heads when

2821
03:30:16,789 --> 03:30:19,999
they saw the rubbish that lay all around.

2822
03:30:19,999 --> 03:30:22,680
Spiro blew out his cheeks and sighed.

2823
03:30:22,680 --> 03:30:25,640
'We've got two days work here,' he said.

2824
03:30:25,640 --> 03:30:29,169
'We'll just have to get on with it.'

2825
03:30:29,169 --> 03:30:34,899
By the next evening there was a clear space
in the middle of the old floor and the trapdoor

2826
03:30:34,899 --> 03:30:39,279
lay revealed in the area that had once been
the kitchen.

2827
03:30:39,279 --> 03:30:44,329
Spiro tried to get his fingers under the iron
ring of the door but, hard as he tried, he

2828
03:30:44,329 --> 03:30:45,749
could not move it.

2829
03:30:45,749 --> 03:30:51,479
He and the child were gazing at the ring and
scratching their heads when they became aware

2830
03:30:51,479 --> 03:30:56,869
of a very big old man in a black suit, standing
a little bent in the doorway.

2831
03:30:56,869 --> 03:31:00,069
'What are you doing?' he asked.

2832
03:31:00,069 --> 03:31:02,629
'Oh, it's you, young Iannis.

2833
03:31:02,629 --> 03:31:05,169
I thought you were looters.'

2834
03:31:05,169 --> 03:31:07,800
'We're trying to open this,' said the boy.

2835
03:31:07,800 --> 03:31:11,689
'It's stuck, and it's got something inside
that we want.'

2836
03:31:11,689 --> 03:31:17,590
The old man came inside and examined the trapdoor
with his watery eyes before slowly bending

2837
03:31:17,590 --> 03:31:23,319
down and putting the tips of the fingers of
one hand under the iron ring.

2838
03:31:23,319 --> 03:31:28,399
He leaned sideways, putting all his weight
and strength into lifting the ring and, with

2839
03:31:28,399 --> 03:31:35,090
a sudden loud crack, the door flew upwards
in a cloud of dust.

2840
03:31:35,090 --> 03:31:40,659
Velisarios rubbed his hands together, blew
on the tips of his fingers and seemed suddenly

2841
03:31:40,659 --> 03:31:44,329
to become a tired old man again.

2842
03:31:44,329 --> 03:31:51,950
'Goodbye, my friends,' he said, and made his
way slowly down the path to the new village.

2843
03:31:51,950 --> 03:31:56,380
'Unbelievable,' said Spiro.

2844
03:31:56,380 --> 03:32:02,670
Inside the hiding-place, in perfect condition,
they found an antique German record player,

2845
03:32:02,670 --> 03:32:09,399
a handmade blanket, a bundle of papers written
in Italian and another package of papers with

2846
03:32:09,399 --> 03:32:12,659
the title, 'A Personal History of Cephallonia'.

2847
03:32:12,659 --> 03:32:19,129
There was also a cloth bundle containing the
most beautiful mandolin that Spiro had ever

2848
03:32:19,129 --> 03:32:21,459
seen.

2849
03:32:21,459 --> 03:32:27,890
When Iannis showed Pelagia the mandolin, she
started crying and, to Iannis's amazement,

2850
03:32:27,890 --> 03:32:31,689
she did not stop for a whole week.

2851
03:32:31,689 --> 03:32:37,069
Iannis comforted her as best he could, climbing
on to her knees, which he was really a little

2852
03:32:37,069 --> 03:32:42,709
too old for, and wiping her tears, wondering
how it was possible to love an old woman with

2853
03:32:42,709 --> 03:32:47,100
stiff knees and thin grey hair so much.

2854
03:32:47,100 --> 03:32:52,779
While Iannis comforted Pelagia, Spiro carefully
cleaned and polished the mandolin.

2855
03:32:52,779 --> 03:32:59,209
He tightened and tuned each string and told
Iannis, with great seriousness, that the mandolin

2856
03:32:59,209 --> 03:33:04,040
was the most precious thing he would ever
own, so that Iannis learned to regard the

2857
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:11,390
instrument with a respect that he had never
felt in church, when dragged there by Pelagia.

2858
03:33:11,390 --> 03:33:12,390
***

2859
03:33:12,390 --> 03:33:18,020
In October 1993 Iannis was fourteen, and he
had had a whole summer in which to play in

2860
03:33:18,020 --> 03:33:22,939
public with Spiridon and have red roses thrown
at him.

2861
03:33:22,939 --> 03:33:27,999
In order not to annoy his grandmother with
his constant practising - in fact not to make

2862
03:33:27,999 --> 03:33:33,620
her cry again - he had gone up to the ruins
of the old house to play in private, and was

2863
03:33:33,620 --> 03:33:37,989
concentrating very hard on a particularly
difficult piece of music.

2864
03:33:37,989 --> 03:33:44,499
He was biting his lip with the effort, and
did not notice an old man who approached him

2865
03:33:44,499 --> 03:33:49,459
and watched him with critical but delighted
interest.

2866
03:33:49,459 --> 03:33:55,489
Iannis nearly jumped out of his seat when
a voice said, in a very strange accent, 'Excuse

2867
03:33:55,489 --> 03:33:57,819
me, young man.'

2868
03:33:57,819 --> 03:33:58,859
'Ah!'

2869
03:33:58,859 --> 03:34:00,350
Iannis exclaimed.

2870
03:34:00,350 --> 03:34:01,959
'You frightened me.'

2871
03:34:01,959 --> 03:34:08,020
'I couldn't help noticing,' said the man,
'that you are doing something wrong.'

2872
03:34:08,020 --> 03:34:15,319
'I know, I'm having trouble with this piece,'
replied Iannis, noticing how unusually bright-eyed

2873
03:34:15,319 --> 03:34:21,539
the old man was, and how there was about him
an atmosphere of energy and laughter.

2874
03:34:21,539 --> 03:34:25,739
'Let me show you how to place your fingers.'

2875
03:34:25,739 --> 03:34:31,760
The old man came over to Iannis and started
to pull the boy's fingers into place, explaining

2876
03:34:31,760 --> 03:34:35,760
as he did so why the fingers were better in
this position.

2877
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:41,879
Then he stood upright and added, 'You can
always tell a really good musician because

2878
03:34:41,879 --> 03:34:46,329
a good musician doesn't seem to be moving
his fingers at all.'

2879
03:34:46,329 --> 03:34:49,479
'You seem to know a lot about it,' said Iannis.

2880
03:34:49,479 --> 03:34:51,329
'Well, I ought to.

2881
03:34:51,329 --> 03:34:54,979
I've been a professional mandolin player for
nearly all my life.

2882
03:34:54,979 --> 03:34:57,720
I can tell that you're going to be good.'

2883
03:34:57,720 --> 03:35:02,840
'Play me something?' asked the boy, offering
him the mandolin.

2884
03:35:02,840 --> 03:35:08,089
The old man took the mandolin, settled it
into this body and began to play in such a

2885
03:35:08,089 --> 03:35:13,419
way that Iannis's mouth fell open with amazement.

2886
03:35:13,419 --> 03:35:19,779
Suddenly the old man stopped, turned the mandolin
over, examined it with an expression of disbelief

2887
03:35:19,779 --> 03:35:26,479
and exclaimed, 'Mother of God, it's Antonia.'

2888
03:35:26,479 --> 03:35:30,329
'How did you know it's called Antonia?'

2889
03:35:30,329 --> 03:35:33,870
asked Iannis, both surprised and suspicious.

2890
03:35:33,870 --> 03:35:36,130
'Have you seen it before?'

2891
03:35:36,130 --> 03:35:38,449
'Where did you find it?

2892
03:35:38,449 --> 03:35:40,109
Who gave it to you?'

2893
03:35:40,109 --> 03:35:45,029
'I dug it out of that hole,' said Iannis,
pointing to the open trapdoor.

2894
03:35:45,029 --> 03:35:47,710
'Grandma told me it was there.'

2895
03:35:47,710 --> 03:35:53,629
'And would your grandmother be Kyria Pelagia,
daughter of Dr Iannis?'

2896
03:35:53,629 --> 03:35:54,629
'That's me.

2897
03:35:54,629 --> 03:35:56,899
I'm called Iannis, after him.'

2898
03:35:56,899 --> 03:36:04,010
The old man sat next to the boy on the wall,
still holding the mandolin, and wiped his

2899
03:36:04,010 --> 03:36:08,760
forehead with a handkerchief, seeming suddenly
very anxious.

2900
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:15,729
'Tell me, young man, is your grandmother alive?

2901
03:36:15,729 --> 03:36:19,770
Is she happy?' he asked finally.

2902
03:36:19,770 --> 03:36:26,359
'She cries sometimes, ever since we dug Antonia
and all the other things out of the hole.'

2903
03:36:26,359 --> 03:36:28,810
'And what about your grandfather?

2904
03:36:28,810 --> 03:36:29,810
Is he well?'

2905
03:36:29,810 --> 03:36:32,850
The boy seemed confused.

2906
03:36:32,850 --> 03:36:36,329
'What grandfather?' he asked.

2907
03:36:36,329 --> 03:36:37,810
'Not your father's father.

2908
03:36:37,810 --> 03:36:42,919
I mean Kyria Pelagia's husband,' said the
old man, wiping his forehead again.

2909
03:36:42,919 --> 03:36:44,680
'There isn't one.

2910
03:36:44,680 --> 03:36:47,229
I didn't even know she had one.'

2911
03:36:47,229 --> 03:36:51,220
'Are you saying that Kyria Pelagia hasn't
got a husband?

2912
03:36:51,220 --> 03:36:53,350
You haven't got a grandfather?'

2913
03:36:53,350 --> 03:36:57,879
'I suppose I must have, but I've never heard
of him.

2914
03:36:57,879 --> 03:37:02,949
I've only got my father's father, and he's
half-dead.'

2915
03:37:02,949 --> 03:37:09,289
The old man stood up, looked around him and
said, 'This was a beautiful place.

2916
03:37:09,289 --> 03:37:12,850
I had the best years of my life here.

2917
03:37:12,850 --> 03:37:14,300
And do you know what?

2918
03:37:14,300 --> 03:37:17,550
I was going to marry your grandmother once.

2919
03:37:17,550 --> 03:37:21,810
I think it's time I saw her again.'

2920
03:37:21,810 --> 03:37:25,869
The two of them were walking down the hill
when Iannis stopped suddenly.

2921
03:37:25,869 --> 03:37:30,789
'If you're the one who played the mandolin
and was going to marry Grandma...

2922
03:37:30,789 --> 03:37:34,659
does that mean you're the ghost?'

2923
03:37:34,659 --> 03:37:43,960
The autumnal sun shone briefly through the
cloud, and the old man paused for thought.

2924
03:37:43,960 --> 03:37:49,229
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The Return

2925
03:37:49,229 --> 03:37:54,979
Antonio Corelli, although in his seventies,
rediscovered a certain youthful energy in

2926
03:37:54,979 --> 03:38:00,999
his old limbs as he danced about, trying to
avoid being hit by the frying pans that Pelagia

2927
03:38:00,999 --> 03:38:03,250
was busily throwing at him.

2928
03:38:03,250 --> 03:38:05,249
'You pig!'

2929
03:38:05,249 --> 03:38:06,249
she screamed.

2930
03:38:06,249 --> 03:38:11,069
'All my life waiting, all my life thinking
you were dead.

2931
03:38:11,069 --> 03:38:13,729
And you alive and me a fool.

2932
03:38:13,729 --> 03:38:16,420
How can you break such promises?

2933
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:17,829
Betrayer!'

2934
03:38:17,829 --> 03:38:22,489
Corelli backed against the wall, trying to
hold off the broomstick that Pelagia was waving

2935
03:38:22,489 --> 03:38:23,489
at him.

2936
03:38:23,489 --> 03:38:25,029
'I told you,' he cried.

2937
03:38:25,029 --> 03:38:27,680
'I thought you were married.'

2938
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:28,689
'Married!'

2939
03:38:28,689 --> 03:38:30,239
she exclaimed bitterly.

2940
03:38:30,239 --> 03:38:31,390
'No such luck!

2941
03:38:31,390 --> 03:38:34,169
Thanks to you, you rat.'

2942
03:38:34,169 --> 03:38:38,770
She made a move as if she was going to hit
him across the head with the broom handle.

2943
03:38:38,770 --> 03:38:41,699
'I came back for you.

2944
03:38:41,699 --> 03:38:42,699
1946.

2945
03:38:42,699 --> 03:38:47,959
I came round the bend and there you were with
the little baby, looking so happy.'

2946
03:38:47,959 --> 03:38:49,409
'Was I married?

2947
03:38:49,409 --> 03:38:50,729
Who told you that?

2948
03:38:50,729 --> 03:38:54,999
So I adopt a baby that someone leaves on my
doorstep...

2949
03:38:54,999 --> 03:38:59,350
Couldn't you have said, "Excuse me, but is
this your baby?"'

2950
03:38:59,350 --> 03:39:00,890
'Please stop hitting me.

2951
03:39:00,890 --> 03:39:03,400
I came back every year, you know I did.

2952
03:39:03,400 --> 03:39:06,800
You saw me, I always saw you with the child.

2953
03:39:06,800 --> 03:39:10,390
I was so bitter I couldn't speak.

2954
03:39:10,390 --> 03:39:12,789
But I had to see you.'

2955
03:39:12,789 --> 03:39:13,930
'Bitter?

2956
03:39:13,930 --> 03:39:16,010
I don't believe my ears.

2957
03:39:16,010 --> 03:39:17,010
You?

2958
03:39:17,010 --> 03:39:18,010
Bitter?'

2959
03:39:18,010 --> 03:39:25,079
'For ten years,' said Corelli, 'for ten years
I was so bitter that I even wanted to kill

2960
03:39:25,079 --> 03:39:26,079
you.

2961
03:39:26,079 --> 03:39:32,670
And then I thought, well, OK, I was away for
three years, perhaps she thought I wasn't

2962
03:39:32,670 --> 03:39:38,489
coming back, perhaps she thought I was dead,
perhaps she thought I'd forgotten, perhaps

2963
03:39:38,489 --> 03:39:41,249
she met someone else and fell in love.

2964
03:39:41,249 --> 03:39:42,760
As long as she's happy.

2965
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:48,640
But I still came back, every year, just to
see you were all right.

2966
03:39:48,640 --> 03:39:49,729
Is that betrayal?'

2967
03:39:49,729 --> 03:39:53,800
'And did you ever see a husband?

2968
03:39:53,800 --> 03:39:58,209
And did you think what it did to me when I
ran to you and you disappeared?

2969
03:39:58,209 --> 03:40:00,739
Did you think about my heart?'

2970
03:40:00,739 --> 03:40:03,810
'OK, so I jumped the wall and hid.

2971
03:40:03,810 --> 03:40:04,909
I had to.

2972
03:40:04,909 --> 03:40:08,079
I thought you were married, I told you.

2973
03:40:08,079 --> 03:40:11,960
Pelagia, please, this is a terrible embarrassment
for the customers.

2974
03:40:11,960 --> 03:40:16,699
Can't we go for a walk and talk about it on
the beach?'

2975
03:40:16,699 --> 03:40:21,359
She looked round at all the faces, some of
them grinning, some of them pretending to

2976
03:40:21,359 --> 03:40:23,869
look the other way.

2977
03:40:23,869 --> 03:40:28,029
Everywhere there were overturned chairs and
tables that Pelagia had thrown to the floor

2978
03:40:28,029 --> 03:40:29,819
in her anger.

2979
03:40:29,819 --> 03:40:34,510
'You should have died,' she shouted, 'and
left me with my dreams.

2980
03:40:34,510 --> 03:40:37,109
You never loved me.'

2981
03:40:37,109 --> 03:40:42,960
She marched out of the door, leaving Corelli
bowing repeatedly to the customers and saying,

2982
03:40:42,960 --> 03:40:45,140
'Please excuse us.'

2983
03:40:45,140 --> 03:40:51,199
Two hours later they were sitting on a familiar
rock, gazing out over the sea at the yellow

2984
03:40:51,199 --> 03:40:54,869
lights of the harbour reflected in the blackened
waters.

2985
03:40:54,869 --> 03:40:58,709
'I see you got my postcards, then,' he said.

2986
03:40:58,709 --> 03:40:59,829
'In Greek.

2987
03:40:59,829 --> 03:41:02,609
Why did you learn Greek?'

2988
03:41:02,609 --> 03:41:05,600
'I was ashamed of being an invader.

2989
03:41:05,600 --> 03:41:10,129
I was so ashamed that I didn't want to be
Italian any more.

2990
03:41:10,129 --> 03:41:13,169
I've been living in Athens for about twenty-five
years.

2991
03:41:13,169 --> 03:41:15,549
I'm a Greek citizen.'

2992
03:41:15,549 --> 03:41:17,859
'Did you become a composer?'

2993
03:41:17,859 --> 03:41:21,680
'Yes, I've played my music all over the world.

2994
03:41:21,680 --> 03:41:24,600
I wrote my first big piece of music for you.

2995
03:41:24,600 --> 03:41:28,159
It's called "Pelagia's March".'

2996
03:41:28,159 --> 03:41:33,510
He noticed that she was trying not to cry,
and thought how emotional she had become in

2997
03:41:33,510 --> 03:41:35,010
her old age.

2998
03:41:35,010 --> 03:41:39,949
She had even knocked out his false teeth,
so that they had fallen in the sand and had

2999
03:41:39,949 --> 03:41:42,479
to be washed in the sea.

3000
03:41:42,479 --> 03:41:49,689
'I feel like an unfinished poem,' said Pelagia,
with a heavy sigh.

3001
03:41:49,689 --> 03:41:52,829
Corelli felt a sting of shame and avoided
a reply.

3002
03:41:52,829 --> 03:41:54,550
'Everything's changed.

3003
03:41:54,550 --> 03:42:01,319
Everything here used to be so pretty and now
the houses look like boxes made of cement.'

3004
03:42:01,319 --> 03:42:09,310
'And we have electricity and telephones and
running water and proper toilets and earthquake-resistant

3005
03:42:09,310 --> 03:42:10,310
houses.

3006
03:42:10,310 --> 03:42:12,720
Is that so bad?'

3007
03:42:12,720 --> 03:42:19,119
There was a silence, during which the thoughts
of both of them returned to the past.

3008
03:42:19,119 --> 03:42:22,560
'I see you still have my ring,' he said.

3009
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:25,789
'Only because I couldn't get it off,' she
answered.

3010
03:42:25,789 --> 03:42:29,739
'I had it altered to fit and now I regret
it.'

3011
03:42:29,739 --> 03:42:32,180
She hesitated.

3012
03:42:32,180 --> 03:42:34,770
'So did you get married?

3013
03:42:34,770 --> 03:42:37,199
I suppose you did.'

3014
03:42:37,199 --> 03:42:38,279
'Me?

3015
03:42:38,279 --> 03:42:39,369
No.

3016
03:42:39,369 --> 03:42:43,470
As I said, I was very bitter for years and
years.

3017
03:42:43,470 --> 03:42:49,270
I was horrible to everyone, especially women,
and then I became successful and I was all

3018
03:42:49,270 --> 03:42:52,180
over the world, flying from one place to another.

3019
03:42:52,180 --> 03:42:57,020
And, anyway, who wants to be with someone
who is dreaming of someone else?'

3020
03:42:57,020 --> 03:43:03,999
'Antonio Corelli, I can see that you can still
tell lies with your silver tongue.

3021
03:43:03,999 --> 03:43:06,140
And how can you bear to look at me now?

3022
03:43:06,140 --> 03:43:07,789
I'm an old woman.

3023
03:43:07,789 --> 03:43:11,299
I feel ashamed to be so old and ugly.

3024
03:43:11,299 --> 03:43:17,989
You look the same, just old and thin, but
I look like someone else, I know it.

3025
03:43:17,989 --> 03:43:20,200
I want you to remember me properly.

3026
03:43:20,200 --> 03:43:22,839
Now I'm just a lump.'

3027
03:43:22,839 --> 03:43:25,670
'You forget that I came to spy on you.

3028
03:43:25,670 --> 03:43:30,270
If you see things happen gradually, there's
no shock.

3029
03:43:30,270 --> 03:43:32,689
You're just the same.'

3030
03:43:32,689 --> 03:43:37,880
He squeezed her hand gently and said, 'Don't
worry, it's still Pelagia.

3031
03:43:37,880 --> 03:43:41,979
Pelagia with a bad temper, but still Pelagia.'

3032
03:43:41,979 --> 03:43:49,359
'Did you ever think that I might have been
raped and that was why I had a baby?'

3033
03:43:49,359 --> 03:43:51,399
'Yes, I did.'

3034
03:43:51,399 --> 03:43:52,489
'And...?'

3035
03:43:52,489 --> 03:43:56,319
'I admit it made a difference.

3036
03:43:56,319 --> 03:43:59,209
We had some ideas about dishonour then, didn't
we?

3037
03:43:59,209 --> 03:44:02,270
Thank God we're not so stupid now.'

3038
03:44:02,270 --> 03:44:05,100
'The man who tried to rape me...

3039
03:44:05,100 --> 03:44:06,959
I shot him.'

3040
03:44:06,959 --> 03:44:08,510
He looked at her in disbelief.

3041
03:44:08,510 --> 03:44:10,580
'You shot him?'

3042
03:44:10,580 --> 03:44:13,020
'I was never dishonoured.

3043
03:44:13,020 --> 03:44:16,710
He was the fiance I had before you.'

3044
03:44:16,710 --> 03:44:19,689
'You never said anything about a fiance.'

3045
03:44:19,689 --> 03:44:20,689
'Jealous?'

3046
03:44:20,689 --> 03:44:22,540
'Of course I'm jealous.'

3047
03:44:22,540 --> 03:44:29,729
The emotion was beginning to stir him a little
too much and he tried to control his feelings.

3048
03:44:29,729 --> 03:44:32,729
Pelagia decided it was time to change the
subject.

3049
03:44:32,729 --> 03:44:34,850
'I want to show you something.

3050
03:44:34,850 --> 03:44:37,789
You never read Carlo's papers, did you?

3051
03:44:37,789 --> 03:44:42,419
Come back to the taverna and eat, and I'll
give you his writing.

3052
03:44:42,419 --> 03:44:44,629
We do an excellent snails dish.'

3053
03:44:44,629 --> 03:44:47,249
'Snails!' he exclaimed.

3054
03:44:47,249 --> 03:44:51,560
'I remember all about snails.'

3055
03:44:51,560 --> 03:44:56,169
Corelli sat at the table with its plastic
cloth and read through the stiff old sheets

3056
03:44:56,169 --> 03:44:58,649
that had curled up at the corners.

3057
03:44:58,649 --> 03:45:03,600
As he read, he frowned, and once or twice
he blinked as if in disbelief.

3058
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:08,939
When he had finished reading, Pelagia came
and sat opposite him.

3059
03:45:08,939 --> 03:45:09,939
'Well?'

3060
03:45:09,939 --> 03:45:11,649
she asked.

3061
03:45:11,649 --> 03:45:13,569
He tapped the pile of papers.

3062
03:45:13,569 --> 03:45:17,239
'I wish you hadn't shown me these.

3063
03:45:17,239 --> 03:45:19,640
I'm more old-fashioned than I thought.

3064
03:45:19,640 --> 03:45:21,560
I had no idea.'

3065
03:45:21,560 --> 03:45:23,390
'He loved you.

3066
03:45:23,390 --> 03:45:25,210
Are you disgusted?'

3067
03:45:25,210 --> 03:45:26,210
'Sad...

3068
03:45:26,210 --> 03:45:27,649
It's a shock.

3069
03:45:27,649 --> 03:45:30,359
I can't help it.'

3070
03:45:30,359 --> 03:45:33,060
'He wasn't just another hero, was he?

3071
03:45:33,060 --> 03:45:34,779
He was more complicated.

3072
03:45:34,779 --> 03:45:36,949
Poor Carlo.'

3073
03:45:36,949 --> 03:45:40,300
They began to talk more freely.

3074
03:45:40,300 --> 03:45:43,260
'Are you very famous then?'

3075
03:45:43,260 --> 03:45:44,799
Pelagia asked.

3076
03:45:44,799 --> 03:45:48,499
'Only in the sense that other musicians have
heard of me.

3077
03:45:48,499 --> 03:45:50,419
I've retired now...

3078
03:45:50,419 --> 03:45:52,800
In fact, I was thinking...

3079
03:45:52,800 --> 03:45:55,310
I want to rebuild the old house.

3080
03:45:55,310 --> 03:45:57,449
I want to live in a nice place.

3081
03:45:57,449 --> 03:45:59,609
A place with memories.'

3082
03:45:59,609 --> 03:46:02,749
'Without water and electricity?'

3083
03:46:02,749 --> 03:46:04,569
'I'll put them in.

3084
03:46:04,569 --> 03:46:06,040
Would you sell me the site?'

3085
03:46:06,040 --> 03:46:07,040
'You're insane.

3086
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:10,539
I don't even know if we own it.'

3087
03:46:10,539 --> 03:46:12,239
'Then you don't mind.

3088
03:46:12,239 --> 03:46:17,039
I'd pay you to come and clean it,' he said
wickedly.

3089
03:46:17,039 --> 03:46:18,290
She took him seriously.

3090
03:46:18,290 --> 03:46:19,290
'What?

3091
03:46:19,290 --> 03:46:20,489
Do I need money?

3092
03:46:20,489 --> 03:46:22,020
With this taverna?

3093
03:46:22,020 --> 03:46:24,369
Go home to Athens.

3094
03:46:24,369 --> 03:46:26,409
Anyway, Lemoni would do it.'

3095
03:46:26,409 --> 03:46:27,589
'Little Lemoni?

3096
03:46:27,589 --> 03:46:29,369
She's still here?'

3097
03:46:29,369 --> 03:46:32,789
'She's as big as a ship and a grandmother.'

3098
03:46:32,789 --> 03:46:39,800
He fell silent again, remembering the past,
then said, 'So do I have your permission to

3099
03:46:39,800 --> 03:46:41,699
rebuild the house?'

3100
03:46:41,699 --> 03:46:45,359
'No,' she said, still holding on to her anger.

3101
03:46:45,359 --> 03:46:46,729
'Oh.'

3102
03:46:46,729 --> 03:46:48,659
He looked at her doubtfully.

3103
03:46:48,659 --> 03:46:52,930
He would return to the topic at a later date,
he decided.

3104
03:46:52,930 --> 03:46:57,930
'I'm going to come and see you tomorrow,'
he said, 'with a surprise.'

3105
03:46:57,930 --> 03:46:59,789
'I don't want any surprises.

3106
03:46:59,789 --> 03:47:01,829
Go to hell with your surprises.

3107
03:47:01,829 --> 03:47:04,250
You owe me a life.'

3108
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:05,250
'Ah.

3109
03:47:05,250 --> 03:47:07,300
I'll bring you a life then.'

3110
03:47:07,300 --> 03:47:10,579
'Stupid old man.'

3111
03:47:10,579 --> 03:47:15,319
He turned up the next day with screaming brakes
in a cloud of blue smoke.

3112
03:47:15,319 --> 03:47:20,720
Pelagia shook her head disapprovingly as he
climbed carefully off the motorbike, which

3113
03:47:20,720 --> 03:47:24,939
was bright red and looked as if it had been
designed for racing.

3114
03:47:24,939 --> 03:47:27,779
'Do you know where we're going?'

3115
03:47:27,779 --> 03:47:28,930
the captain said.

3116
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:34,760
'We're going to see if Casa Nostra is still
there...' he tapped the machine '... on a

3117
03:47:34,760 --> 03:47:35,760
motorbike.'

3118
03:47:35,760 --> 03:47:39,539
'Do you really think the hut survived the
earthquake?

3119
03:47:39,539 --> 03:47:43,039
And do you really think I'm going on a thing
like that?

3120
03:47:43,039 --> 03:47:44,039
At my age?'

3121
03:47:44,039 --> 03:47:46,470
'I hired it specially.

3122
03:47:46,470 --> 03:47:47,819
It goes very well.'

3123
03:47:47,819 --> 03:47:49,760
'No,' she said.

3124
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:52,020
'My knees are too stiff.'

3125
03:47:52,020 --> 03:47:54,999
'Don't you want to see Casa Nostra?'

3126
03:47:54,999 --> 03:47:57,220
'Not with a madman.'

3127
03:47:57,220 --> 03:47:59,560
'I've got it for two days.

3128
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:03,170
We can sit on a rock and watch the sea.'

3129
03:48:03,170 --> 03:48:06,629
It took a long time to persuade her.

3130
03:48:06,629 --> 03:48:12,239
As they swung dangerously from side to side
along the stony roads, she held on tightly

3131
03:48:12,239 --> 03:48:16,220
to his waist, her face buried between his
shoulders.

3132
03:48:16,220 --> 03:48:21,989
Corelli noticed that she held on to him even
more desperately than in the old days, and

3133
03:48:21,989 --> 03:48:27,129
from time to time he deliberately swung to
one side of the road so that she would hold

3134
03:48:27,129 --> 03:48:28,799
him tighter.

3135
03:48:28,799 --> 03:48:36,119
'May the saints save me,' thought Pelagia,
and in search of safety slid her arms right

3136
03:48:36,119 --> 03:48:39,680
round his waist and linked her fingers together.
