00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,090
Introduction

2
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,570
Moreland Road is a street in the city of Bath,
England.

3
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,360
One Friday evening in March, at six o'clock,
people were coming home from work as usual.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,340
The schoolchildren were already at home.

5
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,559
A woman's voice was coming from number 12.

6
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,360
'Jason, are you doing your homework?

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,250
You've got to do it before you go out to see
Maria

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,520
tonight.'

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,220
But there was no answer.

10
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,310
Jason was listening to music and couldn't
hear his mum.

11
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,640
At number 48 David Sen wasn't home yet, but
his wife was.

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,840
Thirty-two-year-old Nina Sen was tired after
a long week of work at the bank.

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,000
She had some news for her husband, but she
wasn't sure how to tell him.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,259
Across the street was number 75.

15
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,130
Maggie was in the living room, sitting on
the sofa.

16
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,070
She was thinking about something.

17
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,720
It was a nice
something, because she had a smile on her

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,080
face.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,110
And then there was Sam Davies, from number
56.

20
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,729
He was walking slowly home, looking a bit
worried.

21
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,410
Actually, he always looked worried.

22
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,439
Money was his problem.

23
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,880
He never had enough for everything.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,810
How was he going to tell his wife that they
couldn't have a holiday this year?

25
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:23,349
So, just another ordinary Friday...

26
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:25,330
CHAPTER ONE

27
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,599
Jason's future

28
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,379
'Jason!

29
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,120
Did you hear me?

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,810
Are you working?'

31
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,040
Jason's mum heard nothing from his room.

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,280
She decided to go and see what was happening.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,820
She stood outside the door of his bedroom
for a minute and then she walked in.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,900
Jason was sitting on the floor and looking
at some photos.

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,739
'What are you doing, Jason?'

36
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,959
she asked.

37
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,270
Jason turned off his music and looked up.

38
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,519
'Do you remember this?'

39
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,480
He gave her a photo.

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,410
'It's me when I was five, and Maria.

41
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,659
She was really pretty - well, she still is.

42
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,909
It was my
birthday party, wasn't it?'

43
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,480
'Yes, I think so,' his mum said.

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,410
'It was the last birthday before Dad left,'
Jason said.

45
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,659
'I remember it very well.'

46
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:38,830
'The party, or the day Dad left?' asked his
mum.

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,950
'Both,' said Jason.

48
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,299
'In my mind, they both happened on the same
day.'

49
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:55,060
'They didn't, but it all happened a long time
ago,' his mum replied.

50
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,360
She walked to the window so Jason couldn't
see her face.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:09,180
Simon, her husband, left their house in Moreland
Road early one morning twelve years ago.

52
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,530
He wrote her a letter and put it on the kitchen
table.

53
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,200
And then he left.

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,850
For twelve years she didn't hear from him.

55
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,630
No letters, no birthday cards for Jason.

56
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,440
Then, last week, there was a phone call.

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,610
'Why did you go?' she asked Simon again and
again.

58
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,220
He wanted to meet her.

59
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,290
'No,' she said, but she wanted to say yes.

60
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,449
Jason's mum turned away from the window.

61
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,230
'Jason, what about your homework?'

62
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,889
she said.

63
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,240
'Why are you looking at old photos?'

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,180
'I want to find all the ones I've got of Maria.

65
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,510
I want to take them with me to London, you
know, when I go to art school.'

66
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,130
He smiled at a
funny photo of Maria, aged eleven.

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,410
'It's a bit early to think about all that,
Jason,' his mum said.

68
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,330
'You're not going until the autumn.

69
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,030
And you don't know if you're going to
get a place at the art school.'

70
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,520
'I will, I'm sure I will.

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,910
When I went to visit them two weeks ago they
said, "We think your work's very good.

72
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,759
We really like your ideas."'

73
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:51,819
'I know, but... anyway, where are you going
with Maria tonight?' asked his mum.

74
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,210
'Broad Street Bar.

75
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,199
There's a great reggae band on,' said Jason.

76
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,639
'Have you told her about going away to art
school in September?' asked his mum.

77
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,259
'Yeah.

78
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,070
She's fine about it, I think,' he replied.

79
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,340
'I can come home at the weekends.'

80
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,350
'You won't...' his mother began and then stopped.

81
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,640
'I know what you're thinking,' said Jason.

82
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,670
'But we're different.

83
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,039
We'll always be together.'

84
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,889
His mother left the room and went downstairs.

85
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,699
'Maybe Jason and Maria are different,' she
thought.

86
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,880
'They've known each other since they
started primary school.

87
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,400
But I thought Simon and I were different,
and look what happened.'

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,669
'Mum.'

89
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,430
Jason came into the kitchen.

90
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,500
'I'm going round to Maria's now.

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,130
I'll have something to eat at her house.

92
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,130
OK?'

93
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,210
'Have you finished your work?' asked his mum.

94
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,509
'Yes.

95
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,790
Stop asking me.

96
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,350
See you later - about twelve.

97
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,919
OK?'

98
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,819
And Jason left the house before his mum had
time to say anything else.

99
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,210
Five
minutes later the phone rang.

100
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,479
Jason's mum jumped out of her chair, looked
at the phone and thought 'Simon.'

101
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,729
She answered it.

102
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,099
'Hello,' she said in a very quiet voice.

103
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,319
'Oh, hi, Mrs Campbell.

104
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,729
Is Jason there?'

105
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,729
'Maria!'

106
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,759
Jason's mum almost shouted her name.

107
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,240
'No, sorry, he's left.

108
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,729
He's on his way to your house.'

109
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,259
'Oh no!' said Maria.

110
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,110
'Is there a problem?'

111
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,160
Jason's mum asked.

112
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,670
'No...

113
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,889
Yes, I can't go out with him tonight.

114
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:12,259
But it's OK, I'll tell him when he arrives
here,' answered Maria.

115
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,259
'Bye.'

116
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,949
Jason's mum sat down.

117
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,009
She drank a little red wine.

118
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,870
She thought about the phone call from Maria.

119
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,640
She thought that Maria's voice was a bit
strange.

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,669
She hoped nothing was wrong.

121
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,339
CHAPTER TWO

122
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,240
Nina's new job

123
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,920
Nina Sen's work at the bank was over for the
week.

124
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:52,460
She was at home at 48, Moreland Road with
her six-year-old son, Max.

125
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,610
He was eating
sausages and chips.

126
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,740
'I got 100 percent in maths today,' he said.

127
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,600
'Did you?

128
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,470
That's great!'

129
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,400
Nina answered.

130
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,970
'You're good with numbers - just like me.'

131
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,730
'Is Dad at work?' asked Max.

132
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,230
'Yes, but he'll be home soon.

133
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,320
He's got the evening off,' Nina replied.

134
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,550
David Sen worked as the top cook at Julie's,
an expensive French

135
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,800
restaurant.

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,710
He worked long hours and very often he didn't
get home until late.

137
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,390
'Oh good!

138
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:45,870
Mum, can my friend Adam come to football with
us tomorrow?' asked Max.

139
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,960
'Of course he can.

140
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,899
Do you want to watch a bit of TV after dinner?'

141
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,610
Nina wanted some time to think before David
came home.

142
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:05,480
But she didn't get much time, because ten
minutes later she heard David come in.

143
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,940
'Hi, Nina.'

144
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,180
David kissed her.

145
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,880
'Where's Max?'

146
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,269
'Watching TV,' said Nina.

147
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,700
'How was the restaurant today?'

148
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,230
'Good.

149
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,950
You know Dan?' asked David.

150
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,130
'The new assistant in the kitchen?

151
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,589
Well, one of my cooks was ill today so Dan
did some cooking.

152
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,570
And he
was great.

153
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,260
He has a French grandmother and he can remember
some of the food she made.

154
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,700
So he's got lots of ideas for the new menu.'

155
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,480
'Daddy, Daddy!'

156
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,430
Max shouted, running into the room.

157
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,390
'Hello, tiger,' said David.

158
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:57,200
'Let's go and read a story, and then you can
tell me all about your day.'

159
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,510
Father and son left the kitchen.

160
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,700
Nina could hear Max's excited voice.

161
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,910
He was really happy to see his father.

162
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,070
'I'm lucky,' thought Nina.

163
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,830
'Why do I want to change things?'

164
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,769
She cooked dinner for herself and David.

165
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:23,370
'Are you ready to eat?' asked Nina when David
came back to the kitchen.

166
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,200
'There's something I want to talk to you about.'

167
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,250
'Mmm.

168
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,550
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.

169
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,890
Is it something important?' he asked.

170
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,060
'The director from head office came to the
bank today.

171
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,300
He told me I was the manager of the month,'
Nina said.

172
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,210
'Well done!

173
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,019
Does that mean you'll get more money?'

174
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,019
David laughed.

175
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,360
'In a way, yes.

176
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,250
He asked me to be the manager in Newcastle.

177
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:05,510
That's a really big bank, about five times
the size of the one here.'

178
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,420
Nina
stopped and looked at David's face.

179
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,350
'So yes, more money.'

180
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,560
'Ah,' was David's only answer.

181
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,790
Then a few seconds later, 'And what did you
say?'

182
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,080
'I said I was interested,' Nina answered.

183
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,950
'I also said I wanted to talk to you.

184
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,139
What do you think?'

185
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:42,490
'First thought,' said David, who stood up
to get a glass of water, 'well done you.

186
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,510
You work hard and I'm pleased for you.

187
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,570
Second thought -
what about my job?

188
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,560
Third thought - Newcastle is so far away from
here.'

189
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,130
'I thought all that too,' said Nina.

190
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,260
She went across the kitchen and stood with
her arms around David.

191
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,480
'And what about Max?

192
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,230
He loves his school and his friends.

193
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,540
And there's my mum and dad to think about,'
continued David.

194
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,170
'I know they live
in Exeter, but it's only a hundred kilometres

195
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,029
from Bath and we see them quite often.'

196
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,320
'They could come with us.

197
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm sure they'll be happy in Newcastle.

198
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,699
Your mum was born near there, wasn't she?'

199
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:37,800
Nina was trying to think of
some more good reasons.

200
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
She really wanted this new job.

201
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:49,410
'Yes, but they have all their friends around
them now, and they love living in Exeter,'

202
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,130
David answered.

203
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,680
'It's a big thing to move at their
age.'

204
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
'Forget them for a minute.

205
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,040
What about you?' asked Nina.

206
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,019
'Well, you know I love working at Julie's,'
David replied.

207
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,880
'We've got a good name since that newspaper
wrote about us.

208
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,190
It's an exciting
time, and I don't really want to leave.

209
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,990
Of course, I'm sorry the restaurant isn't
mine, but we haven't got the money to buy

210
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,680
it, so...'

211
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,829
'I really want to say yes, David,' Nina said.

212
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,590
'I think this is just the beginning.

213
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,389
Maybe I could become manager for a big area
in a few

214
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:41,220
years and after that.

215
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,170
Well, who knows?

216
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,150
Then we could buy two restaurants and...'

217
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,810
'Slow down,' said David with a smile.

218
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,410
'We haven't decided yet.

219
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,570
When does the job start?'

220
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,790
'In three months,' replied Nina.

221
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,820
'David, we're still young.

222
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,850
It could be exciting to start again in a new
city.'

223
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,600
'True,' replied David slowly.

224
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,490
'When do you have to give the bank an answer?'

225
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:25,670
'Well, they want me to decide by the beginning
of next week,' Nina said.

226
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,670
'Say yes, then,' said David quickly.

227
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,170
'What?'

228
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,009
Nina looked at David.

229
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,410
She couldn't believe it.

230
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,170
'Well, we can't buy Julie's - that's what
I'd really like,' David answered.

231
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,680
'But I can get another job in a good restaurant
in Newcastle.

232
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,170
And your work is important.

233
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,210
I know you love it.'

234
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,810
'Oh, David, you're wonderful.

235
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,310
I'm so pleased I married you!'

236
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,940
Nina laughed.

237
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,639
'I'm going to write to head office and tell
them before you

238
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,800
change your mind.'

239
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,759
David pulled Nina close and kissed her.

240
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
'I hope we've done the right thing,' he said.

241
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,769
'Anyway, now I'm going to have a long hot
bath and

242
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,870
think about it.

243
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,730
And then I must phone Mum and Dad - I haven't
spoken to them all week.'

244
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,390
'Don't tell them yet about Newcastle,' said
Nina.

245
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,410
'Let's keep it to ourselves for the weekend.'

246
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,750
Nina sat at the table and wrote.

247
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,790
Then she walked down Moreland Road with her
letter and put it in the post box on the corner.

248
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,100
She heard a
soft 'plop' sound as it fell onto the other

249
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,079
letters in the box.

250
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:11,150
'We've decided what to do and nothing can
change that now,' she thought.

251
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,699
CHAPTER THREE

252
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,319
Dinner at Maggie's

253
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,770
Maggie was sitting on the sofa.

254
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,980
She had a photo in her hand.

255
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,720
She was thinking about her holiday in Chile
last month.

256
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,390
She and her friend
Belen went to Chile for three weeks, walking

257
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,320
in the Andes mountains.

258
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,590
It was a wonderful time.

259
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:48,260
'Well, actually, I don't think the holiday
was as wonderful for Belen as it was for me,'

260
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,160
Maggie thought.

261
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,990
She looked at the photo and saw a happy group
of young people.

262
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,790
They looked happy because the day's walking
was finished.

263
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,570
They were also happy because that was the
day they saw the beautiful bird.

264
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,990
A
condor, the famous bird of the Andes, flew

265
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:18,300
high above them in the sky that day and stayed
with them for hours.

266
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,570
Maggie was sad to see it fly away at the end
of the day.

267
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:30,110
'It was a very important bird for the Inca
people, you know,' said Xavier, their group

268
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,110
leader.

269
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:38,409
'On lots of old Inca buildings you can see
an unusual cross.

270
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,940
It's unusual because it has three levels.

271
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,169
Like this.'

272
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:49,340
And Xavier drew the cross on the ground.

273
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:59,960
He continued, 'For the Incas, each level was
a different world - the lower world, this

274
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,360
world and the higher world.

275
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,390
And there was an animal
for each world.

276
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,200
The higher world had the condor.

277
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:21,030
So you see, these birds were very special,
very important for the Inca people.'

278
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,169
The group were interested in Xavier's stories.

279
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,310
Belen was more interested in Xavier.

280
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:36,000
From day one Maggie knew that Belen liked
Xavier.

281
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,960
Well, he was great-looking and friendly with
everyone.

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,429
Belen talked to Maggie a lot about Xavier.

283
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,030
What he said to her, how she felt.

284
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:57,210
'This is exactly what she was like when we
were at school together,' thought Maggie.

285
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:03,590
'I hope I don't have to listen to this all
holiday.'

286
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,909
At the end of the first week, Maggie went
for a walk after dinner without the others.

287
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,220
She didn't go far.

288
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,690
She just wanted to be quiet and
on her own with the stars in the dark sky.

289
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:27,120
She stood looking up and then she knew that
someone was behind her.

290
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,039
She turned round and saw Xavier.

291
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,970
'Are you OK, Maggie?' he asked.

292
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,400
'Fine,' she replied.

293
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,140
'It's beautiful here, isn't it?

294
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,730
I love the mountains.

295
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,919
It's so different from where I come from.'

296
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,610
'I was born near here, so I love it too,'
Xavier said.

297
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,830
They sat and talked for a long time.

298
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:05,980
She learnt about his life and about the life
of ordinary people in Chile.

299
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,020
From that day, she and Xavier had a special
friendship.

300
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,020
They often talked together after dinner, and
something more than a friendship

301
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,750
began.

302
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,480
And of course Belen saw it.

303
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,770
'It's OK, Maggie, really,' said Belen.

304
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,909
'I don't mind.'

305
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:35,750
But Maggie felt she did mind, and sometimes
she saw Belen looking at her rather

306
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,150
coldly.

307
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:44,130
But at the end of the holiday things were
OK between the two friends.

308
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,190
And Belen actually said she wanted to go on
holiday with Maggie

309
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,340
again.

310
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,580
Maggie got up slowly from the sofa.

311
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,140
She enjoyed dreaming about her time in Chile,
but she had to make dinner.

312
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,340
Belen was coming tonight.

313
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,140
She walked into the kitchen and started cooking
the meat for the lasagne.

314
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,480
'Oh, I forgot to buy the tomatoes,' she thought.

315
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,809
She took her money and left the house.

316
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:23,159
She walked quickly to the shop at the end
of her

317
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,159
street.

318
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,540
In her house the phone rang and, of course,
nobody answered it.

319
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,679
Then the answerphone started: 'Hi, this is
Maggie.

320
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,059
Sorry, I'm not here to
take your call but please leave your name

321
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,380
and number, and I'll call you back later.

322
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,430
Thanks.'

323
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:53,630
There was a small noise at the other end of
the phone - someone was getting ready to speak.

324
00:22:53,630 --> 00:23:00,840
But the person didn't leave a message or their
name and number.

325
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,710
Maggie came back with the tomatoes.

326
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,150
She saw the message light on the phone.

327
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,890
'Probably Belen,' she thought.

328
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,080
'Maybe she's going to be late.'

329
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,610
Maggie played the message, but there was nothing
to listen to.

330
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,190
'Strange,' she thought.

331
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,570
She went into the kitchen and finished the
lasagne.

332
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,919
Then she took a glass of red wine into the
living room.

333
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,070
She picked up the phone.

334
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:48,550
'Telephone number 07788536782 called today
at 19:00 hours,' she heard.

335
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:55,109
Maggie wrote the number down and thought,
'I don't know anyone with that mobile number.

336
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,109
'

337
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,190
But then she heard someone at the front door.

338
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,460
It was Belen.

339
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,390
'Hi, Maggie,' said Belen and gave her a kiss.

340
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,230
'Mmm, something smells good.'

341
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,850
They walked into the living room and Maggie
gave Belen a glass of wine.

342
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,260
'It's good to see you,' said Maggie.

343
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,400
'You look great.

344
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,890
I love your hair.'

345
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,940
'Thanks.

346
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,820
And how's the lovely Xavier?'

347
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,430
asked Belen.

348
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,840
'Have you heard from him?'

349
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,990
'Yeah, I have,' said Maggie.

350
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,230
'I got an email last week.

351
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,960
He was in an Internet cafe in Santiago.'

352
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,730
'Great!

353
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,039
I thought it was just a holiday romance.

354
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,409
But I'm really pleased for you...

355
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:55,830
No, really I am,' said Belen quickly when
she saw

356
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,840
Maggie looking carefully at her.

357
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,610
'He says he's coming to England very soon
- maybe next week,' said Maggie.

358
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,690
'Really!

359
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,860
So soon?

360
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,130
It must be love!' said Belen with a smile.

361
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,679
'Well, I don't know about that.'

362
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,260
Maggie laughed.

363
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,410
'He doesn't say anything about love.

364
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,289
Just that he's coming and that he's written
me a

365
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,660
letter to tell me everything.'

366
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,880
'Everything about what?'

367
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000
Belen asked.

368
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,670
'I don't know.

369
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,909
It's a bit of a strange email.

370
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:39,970
Look, you can read it.'

371
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,580
Maggie gave the email to Belen.

372
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,320
She read:

373
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,930
Hi condor-girl

374
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,679
I'm coming to England very soon.

375
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,670
I need to get away from Chile for a bit.

376
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,309
Have written to tell you everything.

377
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,330
Can't say much now.

378
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,190
Looking
forward to seeing you a lot.

379
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,000
Much love

380
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,910
Xavier

381
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,600
CHAPTER FOUR

382
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,270
Sam has money problems

383
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:23,970
Sam arrived at his house, number 56.

384
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:31,779
The lights were on in every room, and he could
see his sixteen-year-old daughter, Emma, sitting

385
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:36,730
at
her computer in her bedroom.

386
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,140
Sam went inside the house and put his bag
down.

387
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,210
'Wonderful,' he thought.

388
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,440
'No more work until Monday.'

389
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,450
Sam worked for the town's
newspaper - the Bath Chronicle.

390
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:01,090
He was a reporter, but not a very important
one.

391
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:07,100
He quite liked his job, but he didn't get
a lot of money for it.

392
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:15,100
When he started work at the newspaper twenty
years ago, he had big ideas.

393
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,270
He wanted to work there for a few years, and
then move

394
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,260
to London to work for one of the big newspapers.

395
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,419
But time moved on and he didn't.

396
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:37,261
Sam still wrote about the ordinary lives of
people in Bath and sometimes... sometimes

397
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,520
a big story.

398
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,220
Then all the people on the paper had to
work together and it felt good again - for

399
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,320
a short time.

400
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,350
'Hannah, where are you?'

401
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,620
called Sam.

402
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,429
'Upstairs with Alicia,' a voice replied.

403
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:03,400
Sam went upstairs and found his wife, Hannah,
in the bathroom.

404
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:09,789
Two-year-old Alicia was playing in the bath
with about ten yellow plastic

405
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,260
ducks.

406
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:18,529
'Hello, my favourite two girls,' said Sam
and kissed them both.

407
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:23,280
'I heard that, Dad,' called Emma from her
bedroom.

408
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,850
'What about me?

409
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,289
I thought I was your favourite.'

410
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:35,900
'That was yesterday - when you made me a cup
of tea,' said Sam and walked into his older

411
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,029
daughter's room.

412
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,950
Emma was looking at something on
the Internet.

413
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:48,899
'I'm trying to find something about Chile
for my geography teacher,' said Emma and turned

414
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:50,940
to give her father a kiss.

415
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,180
'Go and ask Maggie.

416
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,460
She's just come back from Chile,' replied
her father.

417
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,150
'No, it's OK.

418
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,920
I'll find it on the Internet.

419
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,520
It's quicker.

420
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,870
Anyway, she probably doesn't know much about
the Mapuche Indians.

421
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:19,880
Dad, you know
I really like geography, don't you?' asked

422
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,080
Emma.

423
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,840
'Yes,' replied her father.

424
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,450
'Well, our teacher wants to take us to Norway
after school finishes in the summer.

425
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,430
She told us about it today.

426
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,220
It sounds wonderful.

427
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,640
Can I
go?'

428
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,970
Emma looked at her father.

429
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,100
He could see how excited she was.

430
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,650
'It'll be expensive, won't it?' asked Sam.

431
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,250
'I'm not sure,' replied Emma, but she knew
it wasn't cheap.

432
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,929
'There's the money I got for my birthday.

433
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,480
We can use that.'

434
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,399
'Yes, but that's not enough for a holiday
to Norway.

435
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:15,179
I'll talk to your mum about it,' said Sam,
and he left the room - again thinking

436
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,260
about money.

437
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,610
Sam went into his other daughter's bedroom.

438
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,300
Hannah was sitting on the bed.

439
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,659
Alicia was nearly asleep so Sam kissed her
goodnight.

440
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:35,279
'How much does Emma need for Norway?' he asked
Hannah as they walked downstairs.

441
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,960
'A lot - about 700 pounds, I think.

442
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,890
And she has to tell her teacher on Monday
if she's going,' replied Hannah.

443
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,899
'She really wants to, Sam.'

444
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,149
'I know.

445
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:56,340
I'll try to find the money from somewhere.'

446
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,500
Sam walked into the back garden for a cigarette.

447
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,930
Hannah sat down at the kitchen table
to read the newspaper.

448
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:14,260
Hannah looked up when Sam came back in and
said, 'I could get a job, Sam.

449
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,279
But I really want to stay at home with Alicia
for a bit longer.'

450
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,019
'I know, and that's fine,' said Sam.

451
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,240
'I'll ask Jeremy to lend us some money.

452
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,570
I don't like doing it, but I've done it before.'

453
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,669
His older brother, Jeremy, had a good job.

454
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:45,059
He worked in the world of computers where
nobody thought about not having enough money.

455
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,950
Jeremy
was strong - some people thought he was hard,

456
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,450
not strong.

457
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,419
Every job he got was better than the last
one.

458
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:01,510
He wasn't happy if life was too quiet and
easy.

459
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,309
He was a doer, not a thinker.

460
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,950
His wife was the same.

461
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:12,400
They both worked and played really hard.

462
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,919
'It's good that they don't
have any children because there isn't enough

463
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,510
time for them in their lives,' thought Sam.

464
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:27,049
Jeremy didn't understand how expensive children
were.

465
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:31,409
And Sam hated asking his brother for money.

466
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,990
He could tell that Jeremy felt sorry for his
younger brother.

467
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:41,080
'Why don't you get a better job, Sam?'

468
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,720
Jeremy always asked.

469
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,809
'You're intelligent, you could do anything.'

470
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:52,720
'I like my job,' replied Sam.

471
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,429
'I don't want to work anywhere else.'

472
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:02,960
That wasn't really true, but he could never
let Jeremy know that.

473
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,149
And this was the same conversation Sam and
Jeremy had on the phone that Friday evening.

474
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:12,430
But then it changed...

475
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:21,559
'I'm sorry, Sam, but I'm not going to lend
you the money,' said Jeremy.

476
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,159
'Pardon?' said Sam.

477
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,529
'No, no money this time.

478
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:31,929
You need to think about your job.

479
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,600
Get a job with more money.

480
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,250
You've got to change, Sam.

481
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,260
Every time you need
money, you come to me.

482
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,590
Well, I think it's too easy.'

483
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,390
Jeremy stopped.

484
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,880
Sam put the phone down.

485
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,050
His head was hurting.

486
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,740
He couldn't believe it.

487
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,980
His own brother didn't want to help him.

488
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:07,250
His own brother talked to
him like that, and made him feel small and

489
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,350
dirty.

490
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,730
Sam went back into the kitchen.

491
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,909
'What did he say?' asked Hannah.

492
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,119
'Fine,' said Sam.

493
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,810
'He'll lend us the money, so Emma can go to
Norway.'

494
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:31,690
'I know it's difficult for you to ask, so
thank you, my love,' said Hannah and kissed

495
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,629
him.

496
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:42,109
Sam didn't look at Hannah and went to find
Emma.

497
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:44,710
CHAPTER FIVE

498
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,480
Jason and Maria

499
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,190
Maria opened the front door of her house and
let Jason in.

500
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:59,410
'Hi,' said Jason and kissed Maria.

501
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,030
She took his head in her hands and looked
at him for a few seconds.

502
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,960
'What are you looking at?

503
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,570
Have I got something on my face?' asked Jason,
and he kissed her again.

504
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:23,869
'No, I just wanted to look at you - you've
got a lovely face,' replied Maria and walked

505
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:25,390
into the living room.

506
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,960
'Are you OK?' asked Jason, following her.

507
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,970
'I haven't seen much of you this week.'

508
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,190
'I'm fine,' replied Maria.

509
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,010
Then she turned and looked at Jason.

510
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,810
She saw someone who was her best friend.

511
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:52,950
She saw a person she loved, but
she knew that she was going to change everything.

512
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,950
'Jason, sit down.

513
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,310
I need to talk to you,' said Maria.

514
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,820
She took his hand.

515
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:09,220
'There isn't an easy way to say this, but
I've met someone else.'

516
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:15,190
'What do you mean - met someone else?'

517
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,020
For a moment Jason didn't understand.

518
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,080
Then his face went white.

519
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:29,480
'When I was on holiday with my family in France
at New Year I met a man and...' (this was

520
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,790
the difficult bit to say) 'and I think I love
him.'

521
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,790
'You said you love me,' said Jason in a loud
voice.

522
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,450
'I did.

523
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,450
I do.

524
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:50,740
I do love you, but maybe like a brother.

525
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,360
I feel a different love for Francois.'

526
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,970
Maria looked at Jason.

527
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,730
'Oh Jason, I'm sorry.

528
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,760
I didn't want this to happen.'

529
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,440
'You don't love him,' said Jason.

530
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,420
'It was just a holiday romance.

531
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,090
How can you fall in love with someone else?

532
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,270
Have you heard from him
since the holiday?

533
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,590
Have you seen him?

534
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,339
Does he say that he loves you?'

535
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:25,740
'Yes, he loves me too,' Maria answered.

536
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:32,599
'We've emailed each other every day, and he
came to London last week for a few days.

537
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,609
I saw him
then when I stayed at my sister's.'

538
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:44,140
'You told me your sister wanted to spend some
time with you,' said Jason.

539
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,880
'So that wasn't true, was it?'

540
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Jason looked at Maria.

541
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,740
He couldn't believe what was happening.

542
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,850
'When we finish school in the summer, I'm
going to Paris to study.

543
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:08,109
Francois is studying there at the moment,'
Maria said, not looking at

544
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,109
Jason.

545
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,230
'You've thought of everything, haven't you?

546
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,000
When did you decide all this?'

547
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,710
Jason asked.

548
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,790
Maria didn't reply.

549
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:26,800
Jason got up, put on his coat and said, 'I'm
going.

550
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
I can't stay here.

551
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,280
It hurts just to look at you.'

552
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,670
'Will you be all right?' asked Maria.

553
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,640
'I don't know.

554
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,800
And anyway it's not your problem now, is it?'

555
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,210
replied Jason angrily.

556
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,560
'Jason, please don't,' said Maria.

557
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,690
'Don't go.

558
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,430
We need to talk some more.'

559
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,590
But Jason was already running out of the front
door.

560
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,900
He ran and ran until he couldn't run any more.

561
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,480
He wasn't angry any more, but just so sad.

562
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,640
He started to walk slowly home.

563
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,290
He hoped his
mother was out - he didn't want to talk to

564
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,790
anyone.

565
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,060
When he got to his house, he saw the lights
were on.

566
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,010
He tried to open the door quietly, but he
couldn't.

567
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,170
'Is that you, Jason?'

568
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,220
called his mother from the living room.

569
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,349
'Yes,' he replied.

570
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,599
She came to the door of the living room.

571
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,890
'Why are you back so early?'

572
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:52,589
'I'll tell you tomorrow,' replied Jason.

573
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,030
'I'm going to my room now.'

574
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:01,080
'Please can you come into the living room
for a moment,' his mother said.

575
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,790
'Do I have to?' asked Jason.

576
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,990
'Yes,' his mother replied.

577
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,670
Jason followed his mother into the living
room and saw a man sitting on the sofa.

578
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,319
'Jason,' said his mother.

579
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,289
'This is your father, Simon.'

580
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:31,109
Jason looked at the man and said nothing.

581
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:36,210
Simon said nothing, but couldn't look at Jason.

582
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:44,950
After a minute or two Jason said coldly, 'So
where have you been for the last twelve years?'

583
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:53,900
His father replied, 'It's difficult, but let
me try and tell you what happened.'

584
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,140
But Jason didn't want to hear any more things
that evening.

585
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,620
For the second time that day he ran out of
a house.

586
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:09,250
He went to the river and
sat looking at the water.

587
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,780
He felt lost.

588
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,880
Everything was different.

589
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,400
Maria loved someone else.

590
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:24,920
A strange man - someone he called 'Dad' twelve
years ago - was sitting in his house.

591
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,520
Jason felt he was going mad.

592
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,670
The weather was cold and it was raining, but
he just sat looking at the river.

593
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,170
For a moment he thought about jumping into
the water and

594
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,260
letting it take him away.

595
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,020
'Who will be sorry?

596
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,190
Nobody,' he thought.

597
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:53,730
But, deep inside, he didn't really believe
that.

598
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:58,830
He put his hand into his pocket and found
some cigarettes.

599
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:04,099
He lit one, stood up and turned away from
the river.

600
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,140
For hours he walked the
streets of Bath.

601
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,500
The rain was still falling and he was wet
through.

602
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,250
At about three o'clock in the morning he was
outside the city's mail depot.

603
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,579
There was a lot happening.

604
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,089
Big vans were arriving with bags of letters.

605
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:29,319
Jason was happy to stand outside the gate
and watch the

606
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:32,370
bags going into the building.

607
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,700
He stopped thinking about his problems for
a bit and time passed.

608
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,160
One of the men shouted to him, 'Hey mate,
you all right?

609
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,750
Want a job or something?'

610
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,150
Jason didn't answer.

611
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:56,609
A voice called out from inside the building,
'Harry, tea's ready.

612
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:02,569
Leave those bags and come and get it.'

613
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:06,619
The big gate opened to let the next van in.

614
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:09,340
And Jason just followed.

615
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,200
The man at the gate didn't see him behind
the van - he was too busy

616
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,550
reading his newspaper.

617
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:22,099
The driver got out of the van and went inside.

618
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,790
Then there was nobody but Jason.

619
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:32,260
He wanted to get out of the rain, so he got
into the van and sat down between the bags

620
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,680
of letters.

621
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,840
It was dry and comfortable.

622
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,869
He smoked his last cigarette and then closed
his eyes.

623
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:50,569
He woke up a short time later when he heard
the sound of people laughing in the building.

624
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:54,640
For a moment he didn't know where he was.

625
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,040
Then
he remembered.

626
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,569
He knew he must go home and talk to his mother.

627
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:04,830
Then there was his father.

628
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,830
Jason was angry with him, but he did want
to know why he was back.

629
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:16,320
'And I don't want anyone to find me in this
van,' he thought.

630
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,060
He jumped out and waited in the dark for the
gate to

631
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,589
open again.

632
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,940
When it did, he ran out.

633
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,530
A voice called out behind him, 'Hey, you!

634
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,530
Stop!'

635
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,380
But he didn't.

636
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,420
He ran on.

637
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,010
His head was hurting and his clothes felt
wet and

638
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,630
uncomfortable.

639
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:48,530
There was only one thing in his life that
made him feel good - going away to art school

640
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,690
in the autumn.

641
00:44:50,690 --> 00:45:01,250
It was really important that he
heard from the London art school soon.

642
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,250
CHAPTER SIX

643
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,250
Nina and David talk

644
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,990
David lay in the bath.

645
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:18,550
He thought about Nina's new job, and about
all of them moving to Newcastle.

646
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,530
He loved working at Julie's and he was
sorry to leave it.

647
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,339
And Max liked his school.

648
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,680
But Nina was important too.

649
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,309
David knew she was wonderful at her job.

650
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:38,750
He got out of the bath and put on his jeans
and a blue sweater.

651
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,750
He went into Max's bedroom.

652
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,420
His son was asleep.

653
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,830
David sat on his bed for a
few minutes.

654
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:54,620
Then he gave him a kiss, turned off the light
and left the room.

655
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,339
'Just going to phone Mum and Dad,' David called
to Nina.

656
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:01,339
'OK.

657
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:07,420
Remember, don't tell them about my new job,'
said Nina.

658
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,069
'No, I won't,' replied David.

659
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,850
David phoned his father.

660
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,000
'Hi, Dad.

661
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,220
Are you OK?'

662
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,809
'Fine,' replied his father.

663
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:28,880
'Your mother and I had a lovely walk by the
sea this afternoon.

664
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,200
Anyway, it's good you phoned.

665
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,570
We wanted to
tell you there's something in the post for

666
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:36,570
you.

667
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,410
For your birthday on Tuesday.

668
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:45,839
It'll be a surprise, I know, but I hope it's
a good surprise.'

669
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,380
'That sounds interesting,' said David.

670
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,200
'Are you going to tell me anything more about
it?'

671
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,050
'No, you'll have to wait.

672
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,520
Let me just get your mother.

673
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,750
I know she wants to speak to you,' his father
said.

674
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,810
'Joan!'

675
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,820
his father shouted to his mother.

676
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,090
'It's David on the phone.'

677
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:16,960
'Coming.'

678
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,579
David heard his mother's voice.

679
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:26,660
And then he heard her say in a quiet voice
to his father, 'Have you told him?' and the

680
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,910
answer,
'No.'

681
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:34,270
'Hello, David,' said his mother.

682
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,119
'Are we going to see you soon?

683
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,740
Can you come down next weekend?'

684
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,650
'Yes, on Sunday,' said David.

685
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:53,089
'We can't on Saturday because I'm working,
but Sunday will be fine.'

686
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:56,960
'Oh good,' replied his mother happily.

687
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,119
'We want to see our lovely grandson again.

688
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,589
We're lucky that you live near so we can see
him quite

689
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:08,210
often.'

690
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:15,190
David said something, but all the time he
was thinking, 'How can we tell them that we're

691
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,410
taking him away to Newcastle?'

692
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,309
'I'll give the phone back to your father now.

693
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:28,609
I know he wants to tell you something about
the garden,' his mother said.

694
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:31,630
'See you all next
Sunday.'

695
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:36,140
'Bye, Mum,' David said.

696
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:42,280
He then listened to his father talking about
some ideas he had for his garden.

697
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,000
David could hear how excited he
was.

698
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,069
His father was only really happy when he was
outside and doing things.

699
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:59,550
At the end of the conversation his father
said again, 'I hope our surprise for your

700
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,970
birthday is what you want.'

701
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:08,000
'I'll ring you as soon as I get it,' replied
David.

702
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,619
'Bye for now, Dad.'

703
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,130
David put the phone down and walked into the
living room.

704
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:20,190
'Everything OK?' asked Nina.

705
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,250
'Yes, fine,' said David.

706
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:29,390
'I said we'll go down to see them next Sunday
for the day.

707
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,700
That's OK, isn't it?'

708
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,390
'Sure.'

709
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,380
Nina saw the look on David's face.

710
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:45,710
'Mum said how she loved having Max so near,'
said David, 'and I felt bad.

711
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:51,290
They're getting older and they'll be so sad
when we tell them

712
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,569
about Newcastle.'

713
00:49:53,569 --> 00:50:02,579
'Oh, David, I know, but they'll want us to
do the right thing for us - as a family,'

714
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,450
replied Nina.

715
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:15,020
'But now I really don't know if it is the
right thing any more,' said David quietly.

716
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:21,230
They talked for hours and the questions were
always the same: 'Is it right for us to go

717
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,819
to Newcastle?', 'Do we ask your parents to
go with

718
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:32,079
us?', 'Do we forget about the new job and
stay in Bath?'

719
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,980
And then there was a new idea: maybe David
and Max could stay in Bath and Nina could

720
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,640
go to Newcastle for the week and come home
every

721
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,510
weekend.

722
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,619
But how could David look after Max and work
in the restaurant?

723
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:53,039
In the end they agreed.

724
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,690
It was the same as their earlier decision.

725
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:01,180
Newcastle in June for all the family.

726
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,290
'It'll be OK, won't it?' asked Nina.

727
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:09,670
'I hope so, love,' replied David.

728
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:17,020
'I really hope so.'

729
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,549
CHAPTER SEVEN

730
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:20,549
Maggie's visitor

731
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:26,830
Belen gave Xavier's email back to Maggie.

732
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:31,580
'That's very strange,' she said.

733
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:38,640
'Maybe he's done something wrong - perhaps
the police are after him or something.'

734
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,500
'No, not Xavier,' said Maggie.

735
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,970
'Why not, Maggie?'

736
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,610
answered Belen.

737
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:51,549
'I mean, we were only in Chile for three weeks.

738
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:54,210
How well do we know him?

739
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,730
Have you had any other emails
or letters from him?'

740
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:05,119
'Yes, an earlier email, but it didn't say
anything about coming to England,' replied

741
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,119
Maggie.

742
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:13,140
'Oh well, there's nothing you can do - just
wait for the letter and hope it's nothing

743
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,380
bad,' said Belen.

744
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,160
'I've just remembered something.

745
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,420
Do you mind if I make a quick call?' asked
Maggie.

746
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,730
'Someone phoned me just before you arrived,
but they

747
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,329
didn't leave a message.'

748
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:32,329
'Go ahead,' said Belen.

749
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:35,450
'I'll go into the kitchen.'

750
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:40,099
'No, no problem,' answered Maggie.

751
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:41,099
'Stay.

752
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,780
I won't be a minute.

753
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,579
Then we can eat.'

754
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,829
Maggie rang the mobile number.

755
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:51,859
'Hello,' said a foreign voice.

756
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,240
It was a man.

757
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,300
'Oh hello,' said Maggie.

758
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,750
'You called this number earlier - Bath 726549.

759
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:05,619
Who are you?'

760
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,860
'I'm sorry,' answered the man.

761
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,990
'It was a wrong number.'

762
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,660
'Oh, OK.

763
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:20,210
Bye then,' said Maggie and put the phone down.

764
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,850
'Wrong number.'

765
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,599
Maggie turned to Belen.

766
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,280
'Someone with a Spanish-sounding voice, I
think.'

767
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,170
'From Chile, perhaps?' asked Belen.

768
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,500
'Maybe,' said Maggie.

769
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,220
'Anyway, it's not important.

770
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,119
Let's go into the kitchen and have dinner.'

771
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,890
Maggie and Belen ate the lasagne.

772
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:51,380
They looked at photos from their holiday and
laughed at some of the things they remembered.

773
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,000
There was a noise from the living room and
they both jumped.

774
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,930
'It's OK.'

775
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,930
Maggie laughed.

776
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:01,310
'It's only the window.

777
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,640
When it's windy, it always makes a noise.'

778
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,569
But then there was another, different noise.

779
00:54:10,569 --> 00:54:12,640
Someone was at the front door.

780
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,480
'What a bad time to call,' said Maggie.

781
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,230
She walked to the front door.

782
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:25,049
When she opened it, she saw a man.

783
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:26,049
'Yes?'

784
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:27,980
she asked.

785
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,920
'Can I help you?'

786
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,450
'Are you Maggie Cox?' asked the man.

787
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:39,260
'Yes,' answered Maggie.

788
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,130
'And who...'

789
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,130
But she didn't finish her question.

790
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:49,300
The man came into the house and closed the
door behind him.

791
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,730
'Excuse me!' said Maggie angrily.

792
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,359
'What are you doing?

793
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,710
Who are you?'

794
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,720
Belen heard her shouting and came out of the
kitchen.

795
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:08,160
'Sit down, both of you,' said the man quietly.

796
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,400
'I don't want to hurt you.'

797
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,549
Belen and Maggie sat together on the sofa.

798
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:27,710
'I'm looking for a friend of yours - Xavier
Santos,' said the man.

799
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:33,260
'He's not here,' said Maggie and Belen at
the same time.

800
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,960
'Who are you?' asked Maggie.

801
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:46,289
'Let's just say I'm a friend of the Santos
family,' answered the man.

802
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:52,710
'I know he's in England, and I want to talk
to him.'

803
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:59,990
'I haven't heard from him since we got back
from Chile,' said Maggie quickly.

804
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,869
'Really?' said the man.

805
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:11,190
He walked round the room and looked at everything
- postcards from friends on holiday, the phone

806
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,660
bill that was on
top of the TV.

807
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:21,549
Then Maggie remembered Xavier's email - it
was on the table next to her.

808
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:25,589
It was too late to move it.

809
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:27,839
The man saw it.

810
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:33,630
'So this is from another Xavier, is it?

811
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:40,339
Where's the letter he talks about in the email?'
asked the man.

812
00:56:40,339 --> 00:56:45,359
'I haven't had it yet,' said Maggie.

813
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:50,240
She was afraid and she could feel Belen was
too.

814
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,020
She didn't understand what the man was doing
in her

815
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,020
house.

816
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,550
'How did you know where I live?' asked Maggie.

817
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:07,470
'I found your address in Xavier's home,' said
the man.

818
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,700
'And your photo.

819
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:16,059
Did you have a good time in my country, Maggie?'

820
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:19,039
Maggie didn't answer the question.

821
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:26,339
She asked, but half of her didn't want to
know, 'Why are you looking for Xavier?'

822
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:32,690
'He's got something that I want,' said the
man.

823
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:39,349
'But maybe he gave it to you to bring back
to England.'

824
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:43,740
The man walked up to Maggie and
stood very close.

825
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:49,460
'He didn't give me anything,' said Maggie.

826
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:57,450
'Maybe he didn't, but I know that Xavier will
come here soon.

827
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:01,760
And when he does, I'll be ready for him.'

828
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,010
The man looked hard at Maggie.

829
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:14,080
'You did a bad thing, Maggie, when you chose
Xavier,' said the man.

830
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,770
'He's not right for a nice girl like you.'

831
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,980
He moved away.

832
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:27,790
'Remember, Maggie, I'll come back.'

833
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:32,410
Belen and Maggie jumped up when the man left.

834
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:37,390
'You must phone the police, Maggie,' said
Belen.

835
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,250
'This is terrible.

836
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,330
You must come home with
me.

837
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,380
You're not safe here.'

838
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,430
Maggie phoned and told the police everything.

839
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,940
She told them, 'I'm not going to stay here.

840
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,109
I'm going to stay with a friend tonight.

841
00:58:56,109 --> 00:59:06,730
You can
call me on my mobile, 04776 567831.'

842
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:12,920
The police asked her to go to the police station
the next day.

843
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,539
Maggie put some things in a bag, ready to
leave with Belen.

844
00:59:17,539 --> 00:59:22,140
'I'm so stupid,' said Maggie.

845
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,000
'I thought Xavier was really nice.

846
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,250
I believed he loved me, but he was just playing.'

847
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:43,220
Maggie and Belen called a taxi and left Moreland
Road half an hour later.

848
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,549
CHAPTER EIGHT

849
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,869
What Sam didn't know

850
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:53,270
'How am I going to find 700 pounds?'

851
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,760
thought Sam that Friday evening.

852
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,930
'And why didn't I tell Hannah about Jeremy?'

853
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:04,150
But it was too late now.

854
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,859
Emma was going to Norway.

855
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:09,630
'That's so great, Dad!

856
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,549
Thank you,' she said and kissed him.

857
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:16,960
It made Sam happy to see
her so excited.

858
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,140
'I know what I'll do,' thought Sam sadly.

859
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:29,589
'On Monday morning I'll take some of the jewellery
my mother gave me before she died.

860
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:32,650
There's a
jeweller's shop on the way to work.

861
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:38,190
I'm sure they'll be interested in buying diamond
rings.'

862
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,430
Sam didn't want to sell the jewellery.

863
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,349
He knew his mother wanted Emma to have it.

864
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:48,930
'Maybe my brother is right,' he thought.

865
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,770
'I do need a job with better money.

866
01:00:52,770 --> 01:01:00,069
I don't know how much longer we can go on
like this.'

867
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:07,770
That Friday morning, six hundred kilometres
away in the city of Edinburgh, something important

868
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,960
happened that could change Sam's life.

869
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,849
But
Sam knew nothing about it.

870
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:23,680
Two people, a man and a woman, arrived at
the offices of lawyers Barrett, Grabbe and

871
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,910
Lennox.

872
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:31,290
A man took the two visitors upstairs to the
office of Frank Barrett.

873
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:37,680
It was a very old-fashioned place with big,
dark wood furniture.

874
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,800
There were hundreds of law books all around
the room.

875
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:47,510
'Good morning,' said Mr Barrett to the visitors.

876
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,950
'It's Paul and Sonia Cooper, isn't it?

877
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,859
Please sit down.'

878
01:01:53,859 --> 01:02:00,160
'Thank you,' said Sonia and sat down next
to her brother, Paul.

879
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,760
'I'm sorry about your father,' said Mr Barrett.

880
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,690
'We looked after his business for years here.'

881
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:11,060
'Thank you,' said Paul.

882
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,810
'He was ninety-one when he died.

883
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:20,049
But now we need to know what he decided to
do with his money and things.'

884
01:02:20,049 --> 01:02:22,869
'Paul!' said Sonia.

885
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,700
'That sounds terrible!'

886
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,849
'It's OK,' said Mr Barrett.

887
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:34,059
'Let me tell you what he wrote in his will.'

888
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:39,500
Mr Barrett didn't always enjoy reading a will
to a family.

889
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,059
Sometimes there were surprises in it that
they didn't like.

890
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:53,210
'I leave my house and all that is in the house
to my two children, Paul and Sonia.

891
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:59,200
My money I give to my grandchildren, Robert,
Amy and

892
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Charlie.'

893
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,740
Paul and Sonia looked pleased.

894
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,950
He continued, 'But not all of it.'

895
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:12,619
Their smiles became smaller.

896
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:22,049
'I want to leave some of my money to a special
person who was a good friend to me in my life

897
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:24,579
- Samuel Davies.

898
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:33,210
'About thirty years ago, when my wife died,
Sam lived next door to me.

899
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:39,130
He was a young man, but he spent many hours
with me at that time.

900
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:45,410
He visited me most days and listened to me
when I talked about my wife.

901
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,200
He was a true friend.

902
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,549
I have never forgotten how kind he was.

903
01:03:51,549 --> 01:04:00,030
I want to say thank you to him and to give
him 50,000 pounds.'

904
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:06,850
A few minutes later, Mr Barrett finished reading
and the office was quiet.

905
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:14,020
Then Paul Cooper said, 'Samuel Davies is a
lucky man - 50,000

906
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:21,220
pounds is a lot of money, just for talking
to Dad.'

907
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:25,050
And Sonia said, 'I don't remember him.

908
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:32,849
Well, that's what Dad wanted to do, and it's
his money, so that's that.

909
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:35,310
We can't change anything.

910
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:41,190
But how much will there be for the grandchildren
- Paul's children?'

911
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:43,339
'I'm not sure yet.

912
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:47,520
We'll have to wait and see,' said Mr Barrett.

913
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,859
'We have to let Samuel Davies know.

914
01:04:50,859 --> 01:04:57,849
It could take quite a long time - you
know, the address your father gave us could

915
01:04:57,849 --> 01:04:59,760
be wrong now.

916
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,930
But I'll write to you as soon as I know.'

917
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:09,700
'But if you don't find him, what happens to
the money?' asked Sonia.

918
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,770
'Oh, I'm sure we'll find him.

919
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:21,549
It could take months, but we usually find
people in the end,' replied Mr Barrett.

920
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:25,890
Paul and Sonia left the lawyer's office quietly.

921
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:32,950
Mr Barrett gave some papers to his secretary
and she wrote a letter to Samuel Davies.

922
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:37,380
At
lunchtime she took the letter to the post

923
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:38,440
office.

924
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:45,170
As she put it in the post box, she thought,
'Lucky Samuel Davies.

925
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:50,210
What's he going to do with 50,000 pounds?'

926
01:05:50,210 --> 01:06:01,940
Back in Bath that Friday evening, of course
Sam had no idea about Mr Cooper and his money.

927
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,069
He went to bed unhappy.

928
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:08,770
Was it right to sell
his mother's jewellery?

929
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:18,500
And what job could a man his age get that
paid more money?

930
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,500
CHAPTER NINE

931
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,870
Fire!

932
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:33,039
At three-thirty on the morning of Saturday
15th March, a small fire started in a van

933
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,079
at the back of the mail depot in Bath.

934
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:42,839
Nobody saw it
at first because everyone was inside the building.

935
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:49,270
Then someone smelled something and shouted,
'Fire!'

936
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:53,760
Another person ran outside and saw what was
happening.

937
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,570
Someone else phoned the fire
service.

938
01:06:56,570 --> 01:07:02,319
They tried to put out the fire, but they couldn't.

939
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:07,260
The fire service arrived very quickly and
put out the fire.

940
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,140
But two big bags of letters were lost.

941
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:21,579
In those bags were four very important
letters for some people in Moreland Road.

Dear Jason

950
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:53,829
Thank you for coming to see us last week.

951
01:07:53,829 --> 01:08:00,829
We really like your work and we think that
you are the kind of student who will do well

952

here at
our college.

953
01:08:03,619 --> 01:08:08,510
We are very happy to offer you a place here
from September.

954
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:15,000

Dear David

966
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:11,720
First of all, Happy Birthday!

967
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:16,659
We hope you have a really lovely day.

968
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:23,810
We've been thinking about our future and we
want to do something with our money.

969
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:28,330
We have enough for ourselves, so we've decided
to spend

970
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,470
some.

971
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:37,740
We know how hard you work at Julie's and we
know that you've always wanted it to be yours.

972
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,909
So we've bought it for you.

973
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:46,660
We met Jean-Pierre last month and agreed a
price.

974
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:53,170
Yesterday we heard that it's now ours - well,
yours actually.

975
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:58,619
We both know that you're going to make the
restaurant better than ever.

976
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:01,739
Can we come to dinner on your first big night?

977
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:07,179
Lots of love to our wonderful son

978

980
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,820
Dear Maggie

981
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,719
Hope you got my email.

982
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,640
And I hope this letter won't make you angry.

983
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:33,380
I'm coming to England because I must leave
Chile.

984
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:37,440
I haven't done anything wrong, but my brother
has.

985
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,640
He's in with some bad people.

986
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,250
My
brother has disappeared - nobody knows where

987
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,440
he is.

988
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,520
His 'friends' think I've got some of his papers,
but I haven't.

989
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:59,360
So I want to come to England and get away
from all these problems.

990
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:05,320
Maybe I can get a job and stay there for a
bit.

991
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,800
Also I want to see you.

992
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,480
I think we're at the beginning of an exciting
time together.

993
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,460
I'll be with you very soon.

994
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:26,890
Until then please believe me that I HAVE DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

995
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:31,140
Please email me and tell me I can come.

996
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,370
Lots of love and kisses

Dear Mr Davies

1007
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:13,850
We are writing about Mr Thomas Cooper, who
has sadly died.

1008
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:21,290
Mr Cooper has remembered you in his will and
we would be grateful if you could

1009
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:25,620
write to this office as soon as possible.

1010
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,480
Yours sincerely

Conclusion

1013
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:50,130
And what happened to Jason, David and Nina,
Maggie and the Davies family?

1014
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:55,159
Jason went away for two weeks to stay with
his grandmother.

1015
01:12:55,159 --> 01:13:00,580
She looked after him and he began to feel
better about himself.

1016
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:04,370
When he got
back to Bath he was sad that there was still

1017
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:07,760
no letter from the art school in London.

1018
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,389
He phoned the school, but it was too late.

1019
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:15,840
The school said he could have a place the
next year.

1020
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,530
For a year, Jason stayed in Bath and did lots
of different jobs.

1021
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:29,020
Simon, his father, came
to the house sometimes and Jason began, slowly

1022
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:34,770
and carefully, to get to know him.

1023
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:39,210
Nina's letter to the head office of the bank
arrived safely.

1024
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,699
David never got the letter from his parents,
but his mum and dad phoned him

1025
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:49,050
on his birthday and he learnt about the restaurant.

1026
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,500
It was the best birthday present in the world.

1027
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:58,610
Nina decided to work in Newcastle and come
home at the weekends.

1028
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:04,489
They were lucky because David's niece came
to study at Bath University.

1029
01:14:04,489 --> 01:14:08,870
She stayed with them and looked after
Max.

1030
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:12,060
But it wasn't easy for the family.

1031
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:18,560
David wanted Nina to come home and work with
him in the restaurant, but she stayed at the

1032
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,970
bank in Newcastle for eighteen months.

1033
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:34,050
Then she took the job of area manager in Bristol
- a city twenty-five kilometres from Bath.

1034
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:38,480
Maggie never heard from the Chilean visitor
again.

1035
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,820
She never heard from Xavier again either,
and he never arrived in England.

1036
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:47,980
Maggie was
very sad.

1037
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:53,199
She really thought that she and Xavier were
great together.

1038
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:55,520
It was hard for her.

1039
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:03,820
She wanted to believe that he was a good person,
but all her friends told her to forget him.

1040
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:07,430
Sometimes she thought about going back to
Chile to find him.

1041
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:11,340
But in the end, she
didn't.

1042
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:19,480
She decided that probably it was just a holiday
romance for him after all.

1043
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,170
Sam sold his mother's jewellery and gave Emma
the money.

1044
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:29,690
After a few days, he had another conversation
with his brother.

1045
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:34,690
Then he decided
to leave his job at the newspaper and write

1046
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:36,449
a book.

1047
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:40,900
He worked at home so he could look after Alicia
too.

1048
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:46,840
At first, it was strange for him, but slowly
he began to enjoy his new life.

1049
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:53,130
It was exciting to write and Alicia was an
easy child.

1050
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,860
Hannah got a good job in a shop, which
she enjoyed.

1051
01:15:55,860 --> 01:16:04,360
They were still short of money, but one day
about three months later he got a letter from

1052
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,200
Barrett, Grabbe and Lennox.

1053
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:11,220
Life began to look a lot better for Sam and
his family.
