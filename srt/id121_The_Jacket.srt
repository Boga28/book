The Jacket
Young people should be given chances in life

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:14,849
- especially the chance of a good education.

3
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:25,470
Sometimes that means going to study in another
country, far from home and family.

4
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:36,670
Young Tuaine is at school in New Zealand,
but her home is on a South Sea island, where

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:49,780
the warm waters of the lagoon are as blue
as the sky above...

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:01:04,610
June 24

7
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:14,340
I am going to use this big notebook for my
diary, and write down everything I feel and

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,450
do.

9
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,270
I brought the book with me when I left home.

10
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:30,869
I used it for English at my school back home,
and when I left, there were still plenty of

11
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:38,720
pages not written on, so it will be good for
a diary.

12
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,149
At home I read a story called The Diary of
Anne Frank.

13
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:54,140
It was a very sad story, but I read it lots
of times.

14
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:03,450
Anne said it made her feel better to write
things down, it helped her with all those

15
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:13,670
troubles she had, so maybe my diary will help
me feel better too.

16
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,640
Tomorrow it will be two months since I left
home to come here.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,390
61 days.

18
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:34,940
Just two numbers when I write it like that,
61 days, but it is the slowest and longest

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,330
time I can remember.

20
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,890
How can 61 days go so slowly?

21
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,550
I still think of home all the time, and I
can remember every little thing about the

22
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,510
island, except how warm it was.

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:09,400
I can't remember that, because here it is
so cold all the time, but when I lie here

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:21,510
and close my eyes I can see my friends, and
my family, and all my favourite places.

25
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:31,940
Mama and Papa, and Mele and Metua, and Rima,
and the big black rock where we swam in the

26
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:40,150
lagoon, and the path that goes to the top
of our mountain, and the cool wind at the

27
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,290
top.

28
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:51,700
And if sometimes I can't remember everything,
there are the photos by my bed, and all my

29
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,780
seashells.

30
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:04,290
When I was a baby, I was given to my grandparents,
because I was the youngest in our family,

31
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,450
and that is our custom.

32
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,770
My real parents live on another island.

33
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:19,269
Our village is called Vaipaka, and our house
is a little bit back from the road that goes

34
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,659
through the village, by the hill.

35
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:32,030
When the last big storm - called Sharon - came,
the waves from the lagoon came right over

36
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,479
the road, but not as far as our garden, which
was lucky.

37
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,270
The wind blew all the flowers out of our garden,
but at least the roof stayed on our house,

38
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,580
not like at Mele's place.

39
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,629
A great piece of metal blew off their roof,
right over the house, and cut their goat's

40
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,910
head off.

41
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,930
It was terrible for the poor animal.

42
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:10,080
There were some bad things that happened in
our village, like Sharon, and some accidents

43
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:18,389
on the motorbikes, but mostly there were good
things, and I remember the good things, not

44
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,710
the bad things.

45
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:31,069
School was good too, I liked it at the college,
and I nearly always came top of my class.

46
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:39,610
But I'm sorry about that now, it was coming
top that probably sent me away.

47
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:46,969
We had exams in the first term, and I came
first or second in every exam.

48
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:56,319
Mr Ashton, the teacher, came to our house
and said to Mama and Papa that our school

49
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:05,139
on the island wasn't good enough for me, that
I should go to school in New Zealand.

50
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,800
Mama and Papa talked about it to Uncle George.

51
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:17,539
I was worried, because I didn't want to go
away, but they talked about it again with

52
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:30,979
Mr Ashton, and all my family put in some money
for the plane and sent me here to Aunty Vaine's.

53
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:38,069
Aunty Vaine is my mother's cousin, and she
has been living in Auckland for over twenty

54
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,259
years.

55
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:52,779
There's four of us here in her house: Aunty,
Ta (he's seventeen), Marlene, and me.

56
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,919
Marlene and I sleep in the same bedroom.

57
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,129
She's six.

58
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:08,349
The week after I arrived, Aunty bought me
a uniform, and I started at the girls' college.

59
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:19,089
I've got to stop my diary now, the video has
finished, and Marlene wants to go to bed.

60
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,589
JUNE 25

61
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:30,080
At first, Aunty was friendly.

62
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,039
She asked me all about home and all the relations
she hadn't seen for so long, and she told

63
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:44,069
me the things she used to do when she was
a girl on the island.

64
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:51,020
Then she asked me how much money did I bring
with me from the island, and I said I didn't

65
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,669
bring any, and she got a bit angry.

66
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:02,919
I told her Mama and Papa didn't have any money
to give me, and they told me that Aunty had

67
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,639
a good job and earned plenty of money.

68
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,379
Aunty said she worked in the chicken factory,
but she didn't get much money and most of

69
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,059
it went on paying the rent for the house.

70
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:24,729
Then I asked her where was my uncle?

71
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:33,440
I didn't like to ask about him at first because
perhaps he had left her or something.

72
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,199
Aunty started crying then and told me about
the accident.

73
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:44,260
Uncle Ben worked for a building company that
made bridges.

74
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:52,540
One day one of those very long, heavy pieces
of metal fell on him.

75
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,339
His back was broken, and he died in hospital.

76
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:06,480
I told her I was very sorry I didn't know
about the accident, nobody at home heard about

77
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,310
it.

78
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:20,420
She said Uncle Ben didn't come from our islands,
he was from Niue, so she only told his family.

79
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:28,070
I felt really sad for Aunty then, and bad
that I came to live with her when she didn't

80
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,440
have enough money.

81
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,009
JULY 1

82
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,920
I haven't been able to write in my diary recently.

83
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,570
I have had too much schoolwork to do.

84
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,959
School is very hard here, but the teachers
are nice.

85
00:09:51,959 --> 00:10:02,220
My class teacher Mrs Price is best, she's
great, she introduced me to lots of girls.

86
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:12,459
But they aren't from my island, they're Samoans,
and their language is very strange to me.

87
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:22,240
The school is so big, too, over a thousand
girls, and so many rooms.

88
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,160
It is scary, in a school where there are so
many strangers.

89
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,019
Everyone seems cleverer than me, their English
is so good.

90
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:43,690
I try hard to keep up, but I get much lower
marks than I did at home.

91
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,190
I don't have enough time to do my work, that's
the trouble.

92
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:57,670
Aunty is working evenings at the chicken factory,
and I have to get the dinner every night.

93
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:06,570
The only place I can study is in the bedroom,
and the noise from the video is so bad.

94
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:16,290
Every night Ta gets some videos, and always
they are noisy, full of shooting and wars

95
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,120
and shouting.

96
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,180
I hate that Sylvester Stallone.

97
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:29,320
I think it's bad for Ta to watch just that
kind of video.

98
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,230
Marlene too.

99
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:40,589
Yesterday I went and asked Ta please could
he turn the video down because I was trying

100
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:48,790
to study in my room, and he got angry and
shouted bad words at me.

101
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,610
He thinks he's so special.

102
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:01,110
What a laugh, he's just a stupid boy who can't
get a job.

103
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,690
He won't turn down the video.

104
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:08,569
I'm going to bed now.

105
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:11,810
JULY 5

106
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:18,320
It's Sunday, but we didn't go to church.

107
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,160
Aunty used to go to church but she never goes
now.

108
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,060
When I asked why, she said she didn't believe
in God any more.

109
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,089
I thought that was terrible and I asked her
why.

110
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:42,509
She said it was because God took Uncle Ben
away from them, and left them with no one

111
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:48,410
to take care of them, and not enough money.

112
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:55,490
I don't know if that's right, but I can understand
the way Aunty feels.

113
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,110
I'm not sure about God.

114
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:09,279
He can be very cruel sometimes, even to good
people like Anne Frank and Uncle Ben.

115
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:18,290
In the afternoon we took the bus to visit
Uncle Ben's grave.

116
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,319
There is a smiling photo on the grey stone,
and shiny black letters,

117
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:38,450
BENJAMIN FILIGI, AGED 48 YEARS, MUCH LOVED
HUSBAND AND FATHER.

118
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:45,279
We all cried at the grave, even Ta, when Aunty
put the flowers on it.

119
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:55,230
In the photo on his grave, Uncle Ben looks
like he was a nice man.

120
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,470
JULY 10

121
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,350
I didn't go to school today.

122
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:09,329
I wanted to, but it's a long way and I have
to get the bus, and the bus ticket costs a

123
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,230
lot of money.

124
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,190
Aunty said she didn't have any money left.

125
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,160
She was getting angry with me, so I thought
I will walk to school tomorrow instead of

126
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,410
getting the bus.

127
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:35,449
Today I tried to do my schoolwork by myself
at home, but I didn't do very well.

128
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:40,769
JULY 11

129
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,050
I am very tired tonight.

130
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:52,189
This morning I got up at six o'clock and made
some sandwiches for my lunch, and I left before

131
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:54,500
any of the others were up.

132
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:02,639
It was still dark, and very scary because
there was nobody in the streets.

133
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,990
I walked right down Dominion Road, and slowly
the sky got lighter.

134
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:17,290
My school bag was hurting my shoulder, and
I was trying to remember the way the bus went

135
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,920
from the time when I had a ticket.

136
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:30,670
In the end I got to the school, but it took
a long long time and I was late, and the teacher

137
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,430
at the gate took my name and I had a detention.

138
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,170
That was the first time I ever had one.

139
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,980
My class teacher Mrs Price asked me why I
was late.

140
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:56,050
I didn't like to tell her my Aunty didn't
have any money for the bus, so I said I slept

141
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,480
in.

142
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,970
Mrs Price asked me how I was getting on here,
and she seemed a bit worried.

143
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:15,430
At lunchtime she brought a fifth-form girl
called Moana who was from my country to see

144
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,680
me.

145
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,829
Moana and I talked in our language.

146
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,680
She doesn't come from my island, but I knew
some cousins of hers.

147
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:38,200
I enjoyed talking to Moana, but it made me
sad because I began thinking about home and

148
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,060
all the people I knew.

149
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:49,740
When I told Moana about walking to school,
she took me to the school library and showed

150
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,170
me a street map.

151
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:58,540
We saw that there was a much shorter way for
me to come to school, I don't have to follow

152
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,829
the bus route.

153
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:11,000
Moana asked me if I would like to come to
her place one day, but I saw on the map that

154
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,880
she lives at Te Atatu, too far away from my
place.

155
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:26,250
I walked home that quicker way that I found
on the map, but because of my detention I

156
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,980
didn't get home until six o'clock.

157
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,600
I am very tired tonight, I can't write any
more.

158
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,809
JULY 12

159
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,430
Aunty gave me two dollars this morning.

160
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:52,100
I had to decide if I will spend it on the
bus fare or some lunch.

161
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,059
There was only fried bananas for breakfast
because Aunty doesn't get paid until tomorrow,

162
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,179
so I decided to walk to school and buy my
lunch.

163
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:12,779
At the end of one street there was a bridge
over the motorway that was just for pedestrians.

164
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,940
I stopped and looked down at the motorway.

165
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,320
All those cars!

166
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,500
It was like a great river running into the
city.

167
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,590
Then it started to rain.

168
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:35,490
It rained and rained, very heavy, like it
does at home, but very cold.

169
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:44,220
I don't have a coat or jacket, so I got wet
through, on my hair, down my neck, on my legs,

170
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,299
in my shoes.

171
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:55,610
I kept on walking towards school, and getting
wetter and wetter and colder and colder.

172
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:03,580
Then I saw a clock on a building that said
five minutes to nine.

173
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:11,809
That was too late for school so I turned round
and walked home again, and I was so cold I

174
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:16,140
had to get into bed to keep warm.

175
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,830
I didn't get up until Marlene came home from
school.

176
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,700
JULY 13

177
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:34,720
Aunty is working daytime at the factory now,
so she told Marlene and me to stay home from

178
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,850
school and do the shopping.

179
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,549
We walked to the supermarket and after we
had done the shopping there was some money

180
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,799
left over.

181
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:54,120
We were very hungry, so I got us some Kentucky
Fried Chicken for lunch.

182
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
It was so good!

183
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,440
Marlene and I took the chicken to the park
and ate it there.

184
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,000
When people went past us, they stared.

185
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,480
I knew they were thinking, why aren't those
girls at school?

186
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:24,370
Maybe they would tell the police, so I said
to Marlene come on, we ought to get home now.

187
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:32,789
I felt bad about using Aunty's money for Kentucky
Fried Chicken, and I told Marlene not to say

188
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:33,950
we had it.

189
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,770
I won't do that again.

190
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,770
I went to bed in the afternoon, I didn't feel
very well.

191
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:50,429
My head aches and I think I'm getting a cold.

192
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,210
JULY 18

193
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:01,580
I didn't write in my diary for a few days,
because I stayed in bed with a really bad

194
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
cold.

195
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,760
I felt miserable.

196
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:12,520
I've missed a lot of school now, and I don't
know how I will catch up.

197
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,870
Exams are next month and I'm very worried
about them.

198
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:24,410
Always at home I did well in exams, but I
can't here.

199
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:33,370
I lie on my bed and stare at my photos and
the trochus shell that Papa gave me.

200
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:41,330
When I put the shell to my ear, I can hear
the lagoon whispering to me.

201
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,850
The trochus shells are very special to us.

202
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:53,770
Once every year the people from the villages
can get the trochus from the lagoon, but only

203
00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:00,570
a few for each family, so there will always
be more for next year.

204
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,510
The shells are polished for the tourists.

205
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:14,410
But Papa polished this trochus just for me,
and it is so beautiful with all the different

206
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,360
colours, it is like holding a rainbow in my
hand.

207
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:27,730
Even the darkness here doesn't stop the trochus
from shining.

208
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,010
JULY 19

209
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,110
I had a very bad day today.

210
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:45,059
When I woke up, I decided I must go to school
and catch up my work so I will do well in

211
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:52,179
exams and get a good report to send home to
Mama and Papa.

212
00:22:52,179 --> 00:23:00,750
So I said to Aunty 'I'm going back to school,
'I'm walking but please could I have some

213
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,960
money for my lunch?

214
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:11,380
Then Aunty got very mad, and she shouted at
me: 'I've got no money left for you!

215
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,559
I haven't even got enough money for my own
children!

216
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,820
Why did you have to come here anyway?'

217
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:26,600
I told her I didn't really want to come, and
I'm sorry for all this trouble I am giving

218
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
her.

219
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,630
I said I don't like it here and I want to
go home.

220
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,350
Aunty got even angrier and said she didn't
even have enough money for the bus, so how

221
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,929
is she going to pay for a plane ticket?

222
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:51,600
She said she didn't ask me to come here, she
only said yes because she couldn't say no

223
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,440
to her family.

224
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:03,890
She said if I want to go home my family should
send the money to pay, and I said they couldn't

225
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,690
because they spent all their money sending
me here.

226
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,919
I felt really miserable then and ran out of
the room, crying.

227
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,350
Everything here is money.

228
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:26,559
Money for food, money for buses, money for
warm clothes, money for shoes.

229
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:35,529
Back home we only need money for the motorbike
and a bit of food from the shop.

230
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:43,090
We get everything from the lagoon and the
fields, and we don't worry about money.

231
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:52,710
But here money makes me frightened, because
there isn't enough, and I feel bad that Aunty

232
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,429
has to get more because of me.

233
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,679
I don't know what to do.

234
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,929
There is no telephone here to ring, or at
home.

235
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:15,680
All I can do is lie on my bed and stare at
my photos and hold my trochus shell.

236
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,090
No school again today.

237
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,890
JULY 20

238
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,309
Raining again.

239
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:30,549
I didn't go to school.

240
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:39,250
I did some cleaning in the house and watched
some TV There was a knock on the door but

241
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,769
I didn't answer it.

242
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:49,280
The person put a letter in the letter box,
and later I went out to get it.

243
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,000
It was addressed to Aunty, and I opened it.

244
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:03,929
It said because I hadn't been to school, my
Aunty should visit the school immediately.

245
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,429
I put the letter in the rubbish.

246
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:13,070
I don't want Aunty to get mad again, but I'm
worried.

247
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:20,179
I know it's against the law to not go to school
but I can't go back.

248
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,179
I'm too far behind.

249
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:29,220
Perhaps I can leave school and get a job in
an office.

250
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,680
That would help Aunty with the money.

251
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,290
JULY 21

252
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:45,770
So much happened today, I never had a day
like it in my life.

253
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:53,809
Ta gave me some money for the bus, and told
me how to get downtown.

254
00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:02,070
I caught the bus and ended up in Queen Street,
the first time I have been there.

255
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,190
So many grand buildings!

256
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,919
It was like a TV programme.

257
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:17,909
I began to walk up Queen Street, but there
was a freezing cold wind, and then it started

258
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:22,350
to rain, and felt even colder.

259
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,470
I couldn't stop staring in the shop windows.

260
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,620
All those lovely things!

261
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:38,919
In one shop they were selling holidays, and
there was a big photograph of home, showing

262
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:41,750
my island!

263
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:51,020
It was a very beautiful picture, the lagoon
so blue, and the sea all around so dark, and

264
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:58,130
the whiteness where the waves break on the
reef round the lagoon.

265
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:07,080
I wanted to say to people in the street, 'Look,
there's my island, isn't it beautiful?'

266
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,550
But all the people were just hurrying past,
not stopping, not noticing.

267
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:24,679
I kept on walking up Queen Street, I was looking
for a clothes shop, because I needed a jacket.

268
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:31,860
The wind went right through my clothes, I
felt I wasn't wearing anything at all.

269
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,419
I came to a very big shop and went in.

270
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:45,179
There were lots and lots of jackets, but I
saw one of the shop people staring at me,

271
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,870
so I went back out into the cold and kept
on walking.

272
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:56,400
After a while I came to another shop which
sold jackets.

273
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:05,030
I was very worried about what I was going
to do, but I was so cold and I didn't really

274
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,620
care how wrong it was.

275
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,370
I just didn't want to get caught.

276
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,320
I went into the shop and started looking at
the jackets.

277
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:26,909
I had a white supermarket bag in my pocket,
and I got it out, took a blue jacket and put

278
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:30,830
it in the bag as quickly as I could.

279
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:39,909
My hands were shaking, and I wanted to run,
but instead I walked around slowly and pretended

280
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:45,160
to look at some coats, then I walked out.

281
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,750
I didn't stop until I got to the bridge over
the motorway.

282
00:29:49,750 --> 00:30:01,130
I took out the jacket and saw the price on
it - 125 dollars!

283
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,980
I put it on.

284
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,900
It was so warm!

285
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,740
It's got wool inside and it keeps the rain
out and everything.

286
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,080
I wore it to just before I got home.

287
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:24,440
Then I put it back in the bag and hid it under
my bed.

288
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,100
JULY 22

289
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,240
I couldn't sleep all last night.

290
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,980
It was very bad to take that jacket from the
shop.

291
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,639
The church says you must not steal, and I
can't forget that.

292
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,870
I have heard it all my life.

293
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,679
I won't wear the jacket again.

294
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,760
I am too ashamed.

295
00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:01,630
Anne Frank did not steal, not even food when
she was nearly dead from hunger.

296
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,630
JULY 23

297
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,059
Saturday today.

298
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:15,019
Ta got three videos, all fighting and shooting.

299
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:22,049
I can hear through the wall, and it sounds
like a war is going on.

300
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:30,399
At home on Saturday night we used to go across
to the big holiday hotel on the little island

301
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,840
of Tokoa.

302
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,020
We used to sit under the trees and have fruit
drinks, and watch the dancing for the tourists.

303
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:48,410
It was beautiful there, and I loved the dancing
and the music.

304
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,980
I want to dance at Tokoa when I am older.

305
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,039
I decided what to do about the jacket.

306
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:04,760
On Monday I will take it back to the shop.

307
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,539
JULY 25

308
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,700
So much happened today.

309
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:19,399
I will have to write it down very carefully
to make sure I don't miss anything.

310
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:27,640
When I woke up I put the jacket in my school
bag and told my Aunty I'm going to school.

311
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:38,880
I walked into town and waited until it was
after nine o'clock, then I walked to the shop.

312
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,639
There weren't many people inside, and I went
over to where the jackets were and quickly

313
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,799
started to take the jacket out of my bag.

314
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:58,720
But as I did it, I looked up and saw a lady
with grey hair watching me from the other

315
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,830
side of some dresses.

316
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,720
She saw what I was doing and came over.

317
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,679
'What are you doing?

318
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:10,169
Did you take this?'

319
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:11,169
she said.

320
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:13,899
Her voice was very cross.

321
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:21,419
I couldn't explain to her that I was bringing
it back because I had taken it before.

322
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,690
I thought she wouldn't believe me.

323
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:33,919
She said, 'Come with me,' and she took my
arm and we went over to the back of the shop.

324
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,549
I started to cry.

325
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:44,330
We went into an office, and there was a man
in there sitting at a desk.

326
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,190
He was a young man in a suit.

327
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:57,419
The lady told him she had found me taking
the jacket, and the man said, 'Is this right?'

328
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,800
and I just nodded.

329
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,909
I couldn't stop crying, so I couldn't explain.

330
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:15,379
I will have to go to court, I thought, and
my family will be so ashamed of me.

331
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:21,190
The man told me to sit down and he rang someone
on his telephone.

332
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,869
'It's a shoplifter,' he said.

333
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:34,589
Then the man asked me my name and my address
and my school, and I told him those things.

334
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:42,050
After a bit a police lady came in, and the
shop lady went out.

335
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:48,319
The police lady was young and pretty, with
dark hair.

336
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:57,270
She sat down and asked me questions in a kind
voice, and it was easier to talk to her than

337
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,160
those other ones.

338
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,240
I told her all about the jacket and what I
did.

339
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,760
She said to the man, 'I think she's telling
the truth, and I think we should talk to someone

340
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,090
from the school first.'

341
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,350
The man looked cross, but he said, 'All right,
I have to agree.

342
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,980
This is unusual.'

343
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,740
'Very unusual,' the police lady said.

344
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:37,220
'I never heard of a shoplifter who took back
what she stole.'

345
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:46,560
She smiled at me, and asked, 'Who would you
like us to talk to from school?'

346
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,650
When Mrs Price came in, she looked just as
usual, not worried or anything.

347
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:03,270
But I started crying again because I was so
ashamed, and she sat down next to me and said,

348
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:09,500
'Don't worry, Tuaine, everything will be all
right.'

349
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:18,220
Then she and the police lady talked, and they
seemed really friendly to each other.

350
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:24,660
I don't think the shop manager liked that
and he still looked angry.

351
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,550
Mrs Price asked me why I hadn't been to school.

352
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:40,650
She has got grey hair, but her face is young
and she talks in a very kind way.

353
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:49,329
I told her about the money, and Aunty and
my uncle and how he was killed.

354
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:56,900
And about the exams and how I was worried
about them, and how I got cold when I went

355
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,340
out and how I took the jacket.

356
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,820
I said I was very ashamed for what I did.

357
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:15,670
When my story was finished, Mrs Price looked
at the police lady, and then they both looked

358
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,730
at the manager.

359
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:27,180
The police lady said, 'The jacket has been
returned, Mr Jackson, and I really don't think

360
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,680
this girl is a thief.'

361
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,020
The manager didn't look at her, but he nodded
his head.

362
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:42,930
I said to him, 'I'm very sorry I took your
jacket.

363
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,359
I will never do it again.'

364
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:58,150
He stood up and nodded again, and Mrs Price
said, 'I'll take you home now, Tuaine.'

365
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,300
Mrs Price and I sat in her car outside my
house.

366
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:12,069
She talked slowly and I felt she was thinking
deeply about everything she was saying.

367
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:21,140
She said, 'We can give you extra lessons at
school to help you catch up.

368
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:30,260
And I'll find out if your Aunty can get some
money from the government, I'm sure she can.

369
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,530
That will help with the clothes problem...'

370
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:43,740
Then Mrs Price stopped, and she looked at
me for a long time without speaking.

371
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:55,069
She has very clear grey eyes, very kind and
understanding, and her eyes seemed to see

372
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:58,740
a long way into me.

373
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:10,350
'Or,' she said in a slow voice, 'would you
just like us to arrange for you to go home?'

374
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:16,180
I looked back into those grey, kind eyes.

375
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,290
The way she said it, I knew it was really
possible.

376
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,260
Tears came back into my eyes.

377
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:35,579
Through them I saw a house, and faces, and
the lagoon, shining and blue.

378
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,190
'I would like to go home,' I said.

379
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,290
- THE END -
