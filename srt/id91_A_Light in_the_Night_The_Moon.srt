00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:04,640
CHAPTER ONE
The Man in the Moon

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
HOW DID WE GET TO KNOW THE MOON?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,030
Long ago, people in every part of the world
looked up at the sky, the same way we do now.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,450
The two most important things they saw were
the Sun and the Moon.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,460
The Sun gave a lot of light, but the Moon
gave only a little.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,670
So many people thought the Sun was a man god,
and the Moon a woman god - a goddess.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,970
And people saw a face on the Moon.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,480
They called it "the Man in the Moon."

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,340
Parents still tell their children about him
today.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,800
Then people studied astronomy, and they thought
about how the Moon changed.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,380
In the end, the astronomers understood.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,700
The Moon was a big ball!

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,590
They understood that the Moon and the Earth
go around the Sun.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,010
The Sun shines light on half of the Earth
all the time - this gives us day and night.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,110
The Sun shines on half of the Moon all the
time, too.

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,220
But from Earth, we can't always see all of
the light on the Moon.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,110
When the half of the Moon with light is away
from us, the sky is dark.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,640
This is called a new moon.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,159
When we can see all of the light on the Moon,
it's a full moon.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,350
Between the new moon and the full moon, there
are half-moons and crescent moons.

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,100
CHAPTER TWO
A Helping Hand

22
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,420
HOW DOES THE MOON HELP THE EARTH?

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,070
In 1969, three American astronauts flew in
a rocket to the Moon.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,170
Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on
the Moon.

25
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,170
When he was there, he talked to people on
Earth on the radio.

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,030
But they heard him 1.25 seconds later.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,720
That's because it's more than 350,000 kilometers
from the Moon to the Earth.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
The Moon pulls the Earth.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,200
Because of this, the Earth is turning more
and more slowly.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,290
Our day is getting 0.000015 seconds longer
every year.

31
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,140
But, of course, we don't feel the difference.

32
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,830
The Moon goes around the Earth, but really,
the Earth and the Moon go around each other.

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,230
At the same time, the Earth and the Moon,
together, go around the Sun.

34
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,260
The Earth has a tilt of 23.5 degrees.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,640
Because of the pull of the Moon, this tilt
doesn't change.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,760
And that's a good thing, because it's the
Earth's tilt that gives us our seasons.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,630
Thanks to the Moon, we enjoy spring, summer,
fall, and winter.

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,980
And the Earth doesn't get too hot or too cold
for life.

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,129
The Moon's pull gives us tides, too.

40
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,150
The Moon pulls the sea, and the water goes
up and down.

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,400
The Sun also pulls the sea and gives us tides,
but the Moon's tides are much bigger because

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,940
it is closer to the Earth.

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,290
Tides can help us.

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,269
We can use them to make electricity for our
factories and homes.

45
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,410
And that electricity is clean to make.

46
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,660
It isn't bad for plants and animals.

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,129
The Moon also helps sailors on boats at sea.

48
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,569
At night, they can see where the Moon is - if
there are no clouds.

49
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,900
Then they know where to go.

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,319
The Moon helps animals, too.

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,819
Many animals go out at night.

52
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,099
A little moonlight helps them to see.

53
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,930
Of course, for some small animals, that's
not always a good thing.

54
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,200
Big animals can see them in the moonlight
and eat them!

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
The Moon can also tell animals where to go.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,690
Baby olive ridley turtles start their life
in a hole in the sand on a beach.

57
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,320
They use the Moon to find the sea.

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,950
CHAPTER THREE
Lunatics

59
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,080
CAN THE MOON MAKE PEOPLE CRAZY?

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,650
The word lunar is the adjective we use for
the Moon.

61
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,290
It comes from Latin, the language of the Ancient
Romans.

62
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,980
They called the Moon "Luna."

63
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,239
And lunatic is an old English word for a crazy
person.

64
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,680
A long time ago, people thought the Moon changed
people.

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,739
Lunatics went crazy when the Moon was full.

66
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,109
The Ancient Greek thinker and teacher Aristotle
said this was because there was too much light

67
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,729
from the full moon.

68
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,400
Some people couldn't sleep.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,669
That made them crazy.

70
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,059
Was he right?

71
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,789
We now have streetlights to see at night.

72
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,479
People don't go crazy because of streetlights.

73
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,830
But we know that people in countries with
no night in the summer or no sunlight in the

74
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,190
winter can have problems.

75
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,639
We need both day and night.

76
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,440
Today, it's often bad to use the word "lunatic."

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,499
England stopped using the word in its laws
in 1930.

78
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,919
But people still use it when they talk.

79
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:59,009
For example, if someone is a crazy driver,
we say, "He drives like a lunatic!"

80
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,539
CHAPTER FOUR
Moon Stories

81
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,849
WHY IS THE MOON SO INTERESTING

82
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,330
There are old stories about the Moon in every
country.

83
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,199
The Maoris were the first people in New Zealand.

84
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,919
They lived there before Europeans came.

85
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,789
One old Maori story is about Rona.

86
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,169
Rona was the daughter of the sea god, Tangaroa.

87
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,050
She made the sea go up and down at high and
low tide.

88
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,569
One night, Rona had water in a bucket to take
to her children at home.

89
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,879
She could see where to go in the moonlight.

90
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,789
But then a cloud in the sky covered the Moon.

91
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,189
Rona couldn't see.

92
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,520
She said some bad things about the Moon.

93
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,389
But the Moon heard her and was very angry.

94
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,830
It pulled Rona up into the sky!

95
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,930
Today, many Maoris see a woman and a bucket
in the Moon.

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,979
They say that rain is water from Rona's bucket.

97
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:57,389
In another Maori story, a man - also called
Rona - went to the Moon to find a wife.

98
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,610
Every four weeks, the man eats his wife and
then she eats him.

99
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,559
That's why the dark and light parts of the
Moon get bigger and smaller each month.

100
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:12,110
There are many stories about the Moon in science
fiction books and movies.

101
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,399
Science fiction is about what things are going
to be like in a hundred, a thousand, or a

102
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,999
million years.

103
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,559
Or about worlds that are different from ours.

104
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:26,680
In 1901, H.G. Wells wrote a book called The
First Men in the Moon.

105
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,309
In the book, two men fly a rocket to the Moon.

106
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,119
They find different kinds of aliens there.

107
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,770
Some aliens want to stop them leaving.

108
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,460
In the end, one man goes home, but the other
stays.

109
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,399
Today, we know there's no life on the Moon.

110
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,249
But in 1901, people didn't know that.

111
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,789
Anything was possible.

112
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:52,889
In 1867, the USA wanted to buy Alaska from
Russia.

113
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:57,159
So they sent a scientist called George Davidson
to study it.

114
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:03,259
He wrote down what he saw, and the USA paid
the Russians $7.2 million for Alaska.

115
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,039
Davidson, an astronomer, wanted to see an
eclipse.

116
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,979
So in 1869, he went back to Alaska, to a place
called Chilkat Valley.

117
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,460
Davidson told the people there, "The Sun's
going to go dark tomorrow!"

118
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,479
The Chilkats laughed.

119
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,729
That was impossible, they thought.

120
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,379
But the next day, the Moon went in front of
the Sun.

121
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,520
Everything was dark!

122
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,289
Some Chilkats thought Davidson did it!

123
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,500
The Moon can change how we feel, but can it
change us into animals?

124
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,050
In many countries, there are stories about
people who change into birds, cats, or fish.

125
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,830
Or werewolves!

126
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,360
In the stories, people change into werewolves
when the Moon is full.

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,169
Some people change because a werewolf bites
them.

128
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,810
They get big teeth and hair on all their body.

129
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,330
Then they eat animals - or sometimes people!

130
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,319
Some stories say you can only kill werewolves
with silver, possibly because the color of

131
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,039
the Moon is silver.

132
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,189
The stories aren't true, but they make great
movies!

133
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:15,149
In an Ancient Greek story, a man called Lycaon
doesn't think Zeus is really a god.

134
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,620
To find out, Lycaon kills Zeus's son and cooks
him for Zeus!

135
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,949
But Zeus knows the food isn't animal meat.

136
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,020
He's angry and changes Lycaon into a wolf.

137
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,770
This is one of the oldest werewolf stories.

138
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,419
One of the newest is in the Harry Potter books.

139
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,840
Harry's teacher, Remus Lupin, is a werewolf.

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,110
Werewolves in stories are usually bad, but
Lupin is a good man.

141
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,020
So he isn't happy about being a werewolf.

142
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,320
- THE END -
