00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,220
THE MODEL MILLIONAIRE

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:26,050
Hughie Erskine was a good-looking man.

3
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,840
Hughie Erskine was the best-looking gentleman
in London.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,950
He had curly brown hair, grey eyes and a handsome
face.

5
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,850
He also had many friends.

6
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,390
However, Hughie Erskine did not have much
money.

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,980
His father had been an officer in the army.

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,260
His father was dead.

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,329
Now Hughie had his father's sword and a few
books but no money.

10
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:53,020
Hughie Erskine had tried to do several jobs.

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,640
He had worked for a tea merchant selling tea.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,470
He had worked for a wine merchant selling
wine.

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,270
But poor Hughie was not good at anything.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,930
Hughie was in love and wanted to get married.

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,080
He loved Laura Merton, the daughter of an
army officer.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,310
Laura loved Hughie, but her father did not
want them to get married.

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,610
'You are a fine young man,' Colonel Merton
said to Hughie, 'but you have no money.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,020
My daughter cannot marry a man with no money.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,410
You may marry my daughter when you have ten
thousand pounds.'

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,110
Hughie did not have ten thousand pounds.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,440
He did not have ten pounds.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,190
His old aunt gave him four or five pounds
a week.

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,030
Today he had only one pound in his pocket.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,970
Hughie was almost broke.

25
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,170
Hughie had a friend called Alan Trevor.

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,940
Alan was an artist who painted pictures of
people.

27
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,910
He was a good artist and quite famous.

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,770
Many people wanted him to paint their portrait.

29
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,670
People came to Alan's studio.

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,840
Alan painted their portraits in the studio.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,750
Alan's pictures were very expensive.

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,520
He only painted pictures for rich men.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,640
Hughie Erskine visited Alan Trevor in his
studio.

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,530
Alan was working on a painting.

35
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,060
'What do you think of this?' asked Alan Trevor.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,920
'And what do you think of my model?'

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,110
Hughie looked at the painting.

38
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,310
It was a picture of an old beggar.

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,810
Alan was painting a picture of a man who was
standing in the corner of the studio.

40
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,860
The model was an old man dressed in old, torn
clothes.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,080
The old man's face was sad.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,030
With one hand he held out a hat.

43
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,190
In the other hand he held a stick.

44
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,360
'My model is wonderful,' said Alan.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,500
'Have you ever seen such a wonderful beggar?'

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,370
'Poor old man,' said Hughie.

47
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,740
'How sad he looks.'

48
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,090
'Of course,' said Alan.

49
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,080
'I don't want a beggar to look happy.'

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,580
'How much is a model paid for standing in
your studio?' asked Hughie.

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,460
'Not much,' answered Alan, 'only a shilling
an hour.'

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,670
'And how much money do you get when you sell
a picture?' asked Hughie.

53
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,960
'For this picture, I will get two thousand
pounds,' said Alan.

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,480
'You're a rich man.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,800
I think the model should get some of the money,'
said Hughie.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,150
'Nonsense... nonsense!' said Alan.

57
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,880
'It's difficult to be a painter.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,210
It's not difficult to be a beggar.

59
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,120
Few people can paint pictures.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,100
Anyone can beg.'

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,240
'But many people want to be rich and famous
painters,' said Hughie.

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,510
'No one wants to be a poor beggar.

63
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,280
You artists are very unkind.'

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Alan Trevor laughed.

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,420
'I'm busy,' he said.

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,470
'Sit down and stop talking.'

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,430
A servant came in.

68
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,590
'A gentleman is outside, sir.

69
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,620
He wants you to paint his portrait.

70
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,840
Can you speak to him, please?'

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,820
'Don't go away,' Alan said to Hughie.

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,760
'I'll be back in a moment.'

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,480
Alan left the room.

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,380
The old beggar sat down on a chair and rested.

75
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,920
His hat was still in his hand.

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,290
The old man looked so sad that Hughie felt
sorry for him.

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,710
Hughie put his hand in his pocket.

78
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,960
He had a pound.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,010
It was the last of his money.

80
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,220
Well, he needs the money more than I do, thought
Hughie.

81
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,780
Hughie went across the room and put the pound
in the old man's hat.

82
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,210
The old man was very surprised.

83
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,800
He looked at the money and smiled.

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,130
'Thank you, sir,' he said.

85
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,080
'Thank you very much.'

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,699
Alan Trevor came back into the studio and
Hughie left.

87
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,400
He went to see Laura and told her about the
beggar.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,949
'You gave all your money away?' said Laura.

89
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,129
'That was very-foolish.

90
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,520
My father will never let me marry a foolish
man.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,860
You are very foolish, but you are very kind
and I love you very much.'

92
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,750
That night Hughie met Alan Trevor at a club.

93
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,550
Alan was looking very pleased.

94
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,259
'I finished that picture,' said Alan.

95
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,460
'And my model was very interested in you.

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,860
He asked me lots of questions.'

97
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,400
'Poor old man,' said Hughie.

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,210
'I wish I could help him.

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,580
What did he ask you about me?'

100
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,009
'He wanted to know everything about you,'
Skid Alan.

101
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:17,180
'And what did you tell him?'

102
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,669
'I told him everything,' said Alan.

103
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,870
'I told him all about you.

104
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,460
I told him about Laura.

105
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,400
I told him about Laura's father.

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,159
I told him you want to marry Laura hut have
no money.'

107
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,599
'Alan!' said Hughie angrily.

108
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,790
'You told him all about my private business?'

109
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,960
'Don't be angry,' said Alan.

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,169
'You don't know who I was painting the picture
for.

111
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,729
I was painting it for the Baron von Hausberg.

112
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,749
He is one of the richest men in Europe.

113
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,759
Baron von Hausberg was my model.

114
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,180
The Baron dressed up as an old beggar.'

115
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,540
'The Baron von Hausberg!'

116
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,600
cried Hughie.

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,879
'You mean that old beggar was the Baron himself?'

118
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,599
'Yes,' said Alan.

119
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,810
'But I gave him a pound,' said Hughie.

120
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,410
'Now I feel foolish.'

121
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,120
'You gave him a pound?' said Alan.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,249
'That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.'

123
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,219
Alan Trevor could not stop laughing.

124
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,309
Hughie Erskine walked home.

125
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,800
He felt foolish.

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,379
He had given his last pound to a millionaire.

127
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:23,460
Laura's father would hear about this.

128
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,620
The colonel would never let his daughter marry
a fool.

129
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,110
The next day Hughie Erskine had a visitor.

130
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,279
Hughie did not know the man.

131
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,889
'How can I help you?' asked Hughie.

132
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,789
'I have come from the Baron von Hausberg,'
said the visitor.

133
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,490
'The Baron von Hausberg!' said Hughie Erskine.

134
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,340
'I did not know him when we met yesterday.

135
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,469
I want to tell the Baron that I am sorry.

136
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:50,029
I think I was rude to him.'

137
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,089
The visitor smiled.

138
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,529
'You were not rude to the Baron,' he said.

139
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,840
'The Baron asked me to give you this.'

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,199
He gave Hughie an envelope.

141
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,069
These words were written on the envelope:

142
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:13,419
A wedding present to Hugh Erskine and Laura
Merton, from an old beggar.

143
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:24,139
Inside was a cheque for ten thousand pounds.

144
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:30,250
- THE 
END -
