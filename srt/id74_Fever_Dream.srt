1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,370
FEVER DREAM

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,890
They put him between fresh, clean, laundered
sheets and there was always a newly squeezed

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,990
glass of thick orange juice on the table under
the dim pink lamp.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,799
All Charles had to do was call and Mom or
Dad would stick their heads into his room

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,190
to see how sick he was.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,780
The acoustics of the room were fine; you could
hear the toilet gargling its porcelain throat

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,150
of mornings, you could hear rain tap the roof
or sly mice run in the secret walls or the

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,310
canary singing in its cage downstairs.

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,960
If you were very alert, sickness wasn't too
bad.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,160
He was thirteen, Charles was.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,199
It was mid-September, with the land beginning
to burn with autumn.

12
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,400
He lay in the bed for three days before the
terror overcame him.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,929
His hand began to change.

14
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,420
His right hand.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,789
He looked at it and it was hot and sweating
there on the counterpane alone.

16
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,679
It fluttered, it moved a bit.

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,720
Then it lay there, changing color.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,329
That afternoon the doctor came again and tapped
his thin chest like a little drum.

19
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,309
"How are you?" asked the doctor, smiling.

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,050
"I know, don't tell me: 'My cold is fine,
Doctor, but I feel awful!'

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,050
Ha!"

22
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,390
He laughed at his own oft-repeated joke.

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,510
Charles lay there and for him that terrible
and ancient jest was becoming a reality.

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,750
The joke fixed itself in his mind.

25
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,110
His mind touched and drew away from it in
a pale terror.

26
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,080
The doctor did not know how cruel he was with
his jokes!

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,670
"Doctor," whispered Charles, lying flat and
colorless.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,490
"My hand, it doesn't belong to me any more.

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,730
This morning it changed into something else.

30
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,580
I want you to change it back, Doctor, Doctor!"

31
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,940
The doctor showed his teeth and patted his
hand.

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,750
"It looks fine to me, son.

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,650
You just had a little fever dream."

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,290
"But it changed, Doctor, oh, Doctor," cried
Charles, pitifully holding up his pale wild

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,290
hand.

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,300
"It did!"

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
The doctor winked.

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,010
"I'll give you a pink pill for that."

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,370
He popped a tablet onto Charles' tongue.

40
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,370
"Swallow!"

41
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,480
"Will it make my hand change back and become
me, again?"

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,890
"Yes, yes."

43
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,300
The house was silent when the doctor drove
off down the road in his car under the quiet,

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,569
blue September sky.

45
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,610
A clock ticked far below in the kitchen world.

46
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,200
Charles lay looking at his hand.

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,690
It did not change back.

48
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,420
It was still something else.

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,989
The wind blew outside.

50
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:23,620
Leaves fell against the cool window.

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,540
At four o'clock his other hand changed.

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,230
It seemed almost to become a fever.

53
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,099
It pulsed and shifted, cell by cell.

54
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,549
It beat like a warm heart.

55
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:35,209
The fingernails turned blue and then red.

56
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,400
It took about an hour for it to change and
when it was finished, it looked just like

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,830
any ordinary hand.

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,349
But it was not ordinary.

59
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,409
It no longer was him any more.

60
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:51,430
He lay in a fascinated horror and then fell
into an exhausted sleep.

61
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,180
Mother brought the soup up at six.

62
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,420
He wouldn't touch it "I haven't any hands,"
he said, eyes shut.

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,870
"Your hands are perfectly good," said Mother.

64
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,010
"No," he wailed.

65
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,560
"My hands are gone.

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,490
I feel like I have stumps.

67
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,279
Oh, Mama, Mama, hold me, hold me, I'm scared!"

68
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,459
She had to feed him herself.

69
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,139
"Mama," he said, "get the doctor, please,
again.

70
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,139
I'm so sick."

71
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,299
"The doctor'll be here tonight at eight,"
she said, and went out.

72
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,749
At seven, with night dark and close around
the house, Charles was sitting up in bed when

73
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:27,090
he felt the thing happening to first one leg
and then the other.

74
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,090
"Mama!

75
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,090
Come quick!" he screamed.

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,569
But when Mama came the thing was no longer
happening.

77
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,939
When she went downstairs, he simply lay without
fighting as his legs beat and beat, grew warm,

78
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,560
red-hot, and the room filled with the warmth
of his feverish change.

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,859
The glow crept up from his toes to his ankles
and then to his knees.

80
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,329
"May I come in?"

81
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,680
The doctor smiled in the doorway.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
"Doctor!"

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
cried Charles.

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,810
"Hurry, take off my blankets!"

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,510
The doctor lifted the blankets tolerantly.

86
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,669
"There you are.

87
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,829
Whole and healthy.

88
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,829
Sweating, though.

89
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,829
A little fever.

90
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,519
I told you not to move around, bad boy."

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,709
He pinched the moist pink cheek.

92
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,890
"Did the pills help?

93
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,730
Did your hand change back?"

94
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,579
"No, no, now it's my other hand and my legs!"

95
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:16,320
"Well, well, I'll have to give you three more
pills, one for each limb, eh, my little peach?"

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
laughed the doctor.

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,160
"Will they help me?

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Please, please.

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,290
What've I got?

100
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,290
"

101
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,139
"A mild case of scarlet fever, complicated
by a slight cold."

102
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,740
"Is it a germ that lives and has more little
germs in me?"

103
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
"Yes."

104
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,090
"Are you sure it's scarlet fever?

105
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,810
You haven't taken any tests!"

106
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,840
"I guess I know a certain fever when I see
one," said the doctor, checking the boy's

107
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,759
pulse with cool authority.

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,130
Charles lay there, not speaking until the
doctor was crisply packing his black kit.

109
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,090
Then in the silent room, the boy's voice made
a small, weak pattern, his eyes alight with

110
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,120
remembrance.

111
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,479
"I read a book once.

112
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,220
About petrified trees, wood turning to stone.

113
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,979
About how trees fell and rotted and minerals
got in and built up and they look just like

114
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,480
trees, but they're not, they're stone."

115
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,130
He stopped.

116
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,669
In the quiet warm room his breathing sounded.

117
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,530
"Well?" asked the doctor.

118
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,060
"I've been thinking," said Charles after a
time.

119
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,599
"Do germs ever get big?

120
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:24,069
I mean, in biology class they told us about
one-celled animals, amoebas and things, and

121
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,280
how millions of years ago they got together
until there was a bunch and they made the

122
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,780
first body.

123
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,419
And more and more cells got together and got
bigger and then finally maybe there was a

124
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:43,440
fish and finally here we are, and all we are
is a bunch of cells that decided to get together,

125
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,789
to help each other out.

126
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,639
Isn't that right?"

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
Charles wet his feverish lips.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,970
"What's all this about?"

129
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,229
The doctor bent over him.

130
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,280
"I've got to tell you this.

131
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,689
Doctor, oh, I've got to!" he cried.

132
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:03,379
"What would happen, oh just pretend, please
pretend, that just like in the old days, a

133
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:11,050
lot of microbes got together and wanted to
make a bunch, and reproduced and made more-"

134
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,660
His white hands were on his chest now, crawling
toward his throat.

135
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,270
"And they decided to take over a person!"

136
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,550
cried Charles.

137
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,430
"Take over a person?"

138
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,940
"Yes, become a person.

139
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,169
Me, my hands, my feet!

140
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,090
What if a disease somehow knew how to kill
a person and yet live after him?"

141
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,520
He screamed.

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,159
The hands were on his neck.

143
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,460
The doctor moved forward, shouting.

144
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,610
At nine o'clock the doctor was escorted out
to his car by the mother and father, who handed

145
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
him his bag.

146
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,620
They conversed in the cool night wind for
a few minutes.

147
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,199
"Just be sure his hands are kept strapped
to his legs," said the doctor.

148
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,960
"I don't want him hurting himself."

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,090
"Will he be all right, Doctor?"

150
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,879
The mother held to his arm a moment.

151
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,240
He patted her shoulder.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,979
"Haven't I been your family physician for
thirty years?

153
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,000
It's the fever.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,220
He imagines things."

155
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,120
"But those bruises on his throat, he almost
choked himself."

156
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,500
"Just you keep him strapped; he'll be all
right in the morning."

157
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,620
The car moved off down the dark September
road.

158
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,849
At three in the morning, Charles was still
awake in his small black room.

159
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,030
The bed was damp under his head and his back.

160
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,129
He was very warm.

161
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:26,729
Now he no longer had any arms or legs, and
his body was beginning to change.

162
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:33,199
He did not move on the bed, but looked at
the vast blank ceiling space with insane concentration.

163
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,740
For a while he had screamed and thrashed,
but now he was weak and hoarse from it, and

164
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,780
his mother had gotten up a number of times
to soothe his brow with a wet towel.

165
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,949
Now he was silent, his hands strapped to his
legs.

166
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:50,520
He felt the walls of his body change, the
organs shift, the lungs catch fire like burning

167
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,599
bellows of pink alcohol.

168
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,550
The room was lighted up as with the flickerings
of a hearth.

169
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,660
Now he had no body.

170
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
It was all gone.

171
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,840
It was under him, but it was filled with a
vast pulse of some burning, lethargic drug.

172
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,380
It was as if a guillotine had neatly lopped
off his head, and his head lay shining on

173
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,610
a midnight pillow while the body, below, still
alive, belonged to somebody else.

174
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,620
The disease had eaten his body and from the
eating had reproduced itself in feverish duplicate.

175
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,999
There were the little hand hairs and the fingernails
and the scars and the toenails and the tiny

176
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,879
mole on his right hip, all done again in perfect
fashion.

177
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,719
I am dead, he thought.

178
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,909
I've been killed, and yet I live.

179
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,200
My body is dead, it is all disease and nobody
will know.

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,039
I will walk around and it will not be me,
it will be something else.

181
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,910
It will be something all bad, all evil, so
big and so evil it's hard to understand or

182
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,180
think about.

183
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,870
Something that will buy shoes and drink water
and get married some day maybe and do more

184
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,660
evil in the world than has ever been done.

185
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,160
Now the warmth was stealing up his neck, into
his cheeks, like a hot wine.

186
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,750
His lips burned, his eyelids, like leaves,
caught fire.

187
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,400
His nostrils breathed out blue flame, faintly,
faintly.

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,130
This will be all, he thought.

189
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,940
It'll take my head and my brain and fix each
eye and every tooth and all the marks in my

190
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,910
brain, and every hair and every wrinkle in
my ears, and there'll be nothing left of me.

191
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,709
He felt his brain fill with a boiling mercury.

192
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:27,300
He felt his left eye clench in upon itself
and, like a snail, withdraw, shift.

193
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,889
He was blind in his left eye.

194
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,460
It no longer belonged to him.

195
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,029
It was enemy territory.

196
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,201
His tongue was gone, cut out.

197
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,220
His left cheek was numbed, lost.

198
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,170
His left ear stopped hearing.

199
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,000
It belonged to someone else now.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,560
This thing that was being born, this mineral
thing replacing the wooden log, this disease

201
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,820
replacing healthy animal cell.

202
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,600
He tried to scream and he was able to scream
loud and high and sharply in the room, just

203
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,800
as his brain flooded down, his right eye and
right ear were cut out, he was blind and deaf,

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,060
all fire, all terror, all panic, all death.

205
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,790
His scream stopped before his mother ran through
the door to his side.

206
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,740
It was a good, clear morning, with a brisk
wind that helped carry the doctor up the path

207
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
before the house.

208
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,380
In the window above, the boy stood, fully
dressed.

209
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,880
He did not wave when the doctor waved and
called, "What's this?

210
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Up?

211
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
My God!"

212
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
The doctor almost ran upstairs.

213
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,300
He came gasping into the bedroom.

214
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,680
"What are you doing out of bed?" he demanded
of the boy.

215
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,360
He tapped his thin chest, took his pulse and
temperature.

216
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,630
"Absolutely amazing!

217
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,630
Normal.

218
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,850
Normal, by God!"

219
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,760
"I shall never be sick again in my life,"
declared the boy, quietly, standing there,

220
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,210
looking out the wide window.

221
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,210
"Never."

222
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,210
"I hope not.

223
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,350
Why, you're looking fine, Charles."

224
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,350
"Doctor?"

225
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,350
"Yes, Charles?"

226
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,800
"Can I go to school now?" asked Charles.

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,199
"Tomorrow will be time enough.

228
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,990
You sound positively eager."

229
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,089
"I am.

230
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:54,649
I like school.

231
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,750
All the kids.

232
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,480
I want to play with them and wrestle with
them, and spit on them and play with the girls'

233
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,240
pigtails and shake the teacher's hand, and
rub my hands on all the cloaks in the cloakroom,

234
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,960
and I want to grow up and travel and shake
hands with people all over the world, and

235
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,940
be married and have lots of children, and
go to libraries and handle books and - all

236
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,240
of that I want to!" said the boy, looking
off into the September morning.

237
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,810
"What's the name you called me?"

238
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,870
"What?"

239
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,990
The doctor puzzled.

240
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,340
"I called you nothing but Charles."

241
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,589
"It's better than no name at all, I guess."

242
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,649
The boy shrugged.

243
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,459
"I'm glad you want to go back to school,"
said the doctor.

244
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,520
"I really anticipate it," smiled the boy.

245
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,380
"Thank you for your help, Doctor.

246
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,640
Shake hands."

247
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,899
"Glad to."

248
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,470
They shook hands gravely, and the clear wind
blew through the open window.

249
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,470
They shook hands for almost a minute, the
boy smiling up at the old man and thanking

250
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,470
him.

251
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,250
Then, laughing, the boy raced the doctor downstairs
and out to his car.

252
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,750
His mother and father followed for the happy
farewell.

253
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,820
"Fit as a fiddle!" said the doctor.

254
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,820
"Incredible!"

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,320
"And strong," said the father.

256
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,450
"He got out of his straps himself during the
night.

257
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,450
Didn't you, Charles?"

258
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,300
"Did I?" said the boy.

259
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,340
"You did!

260
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,340
How?"

261
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,949
"Oh," the boy said, "that was a long time
ago."

262
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,170
"A long time ago!"

263
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,370
They all laughed, and while they were laughing,
the quiet boy moved his bare foot on the sidewalk

264
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,140
and merely touched, brushed against a number
of red ants that was scurrying about on the

265
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
sidewalk.

266
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,980
Secretly, his eyes shining, while his parents
chatted with the old man, he saw the ants

267
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,170
hesitate, quiver, and lie still on the cement.

268
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,389
He sensed they were cold now.

269
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:35,389
"Good-by!"

270
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,389
The doctor drove away, waving.

271
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,540
The boy walked ahead of his parents.

272
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,870
As he walked he looked away toward the town
and began to hum "School Days" under his breath.

273
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,430
"It's good to have him well again," said the
father.

274
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,839
"Listen to him.

275
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,430
He's so looking forward to school!"

276
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,860
The boy turned quietly.

277
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,279
He gave each of his parents a crushing hug.

278
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,220
He kissed them both several times.

279
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,360
Then without a word he bounded up the steps
into the house.

280
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,010
In the parlor, before the others entered,
he quickly opened the bird cage, thrust his

281
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,130
hand in, and petted the yellow canary, once.

282
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,730
Then he shut the cage door, stood back, and
waited.

283
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,319
- THE END -
