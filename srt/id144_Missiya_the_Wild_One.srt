1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,790
Childhood is a time of innocence, when life
is simple and uncomplicated.

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,910
Children, watching the comings and goings
of adults, often see things that they don't

3
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,590
understand until years later, when they are
adults themselves and know the ways of the

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,480
world.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:55,670
And the ways of the world are sometimes rather
sad...

6
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,070
There is still talk about her in the village,
all these years later.

7
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,670
She did not come back after she went away
so suddenly that morning ... no one really

8
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,240
cared to find out what happened to her.

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,190
But they did not forget her.

10
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:23,150
Even recently an old man in the village said
her name, Missiya, with sadness in his voice.

11
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,140
And the village never again knew anyone quite
like her.

12
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:35,390
They remembered her not so much for her good
looks as for her boldness.

13
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,530
She was good-looking, though.

14
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,090
But in those days there was no way a good-looking
girl could escape from village life and make

15
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,070
an exciting future for herself.

16
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:54,420
What could Missiya do, except sell her good
looks while she was young?

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,220
Selling them for so little - almost nothing.

18
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:06,630
Every time I go back home to the village I
see Missiya in my mind.

19
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,200
She had brown skin which shone with good health,
and a beautiful, strong body.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,150
She moved beautifully too.

21
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,329
She used to carry a full pot of water on her
hip and use her other hand to pick a fruit

22
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,840
or a branch off a tree for firewood.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,290
She was full of fun.

24
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,489
She ran when there was no need to run, smiled
all the time and laughed often.

25
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:43,450
The women envied her, and felt jealous of
the way men watched her lovely body.

26
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,050
Missiya never married.

27
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,069
She never wanted to be like other village
girls, who spent time getting to know boys,

28
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:59,010
walking in the fields, talking of love, and
making careful plans for the future.

29
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:06,090
Missiya's house was usually full of men, and
her parents did not mind her free and easy

30
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,879
ways with the young men - and older ones - who
crowded into that little house.

31
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,749
No surprise, then, that before she was sixteen,
people were already talking about her!

32
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:26,019
As a child I couldn't take my eyes off her.

33
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,459
She had a pair of eyes which seemed enormous
to me.

34
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,489
Her smiling lips were full and red with betel
juice.

35
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,849
She used to laugh at the way I watched her,
wide-eyed.

36
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,419
Under her breath and still smiling, she used
to whisper something which I knew was not

37
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,239
meant for my child's ears.

38
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,459
But there was no harm in her - it was her
nature, her love of life!

39
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,110
But there were things I did not understand
about her.

40
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,230
Sometimes she was my friend.

41
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,969
On some days when I saw her, she used to greet
me cheerfully, take my hand in hers and take

42
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:18,690
me into the woods to pick fruit, show me the
animals and birds and a thousand secrets that

43
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,989
lay hidden there.

44
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:26,730
But there were days when she pretended not
to see me and looked away, as she hurried

45
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,250
into the woods.

46
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,310
That always made me sad and I felt a warm
tear roll down my face.

47
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,650
At those times I used to look away too, pretending
to look at a wild flower or watch some insects

48
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,350
on the ground.

49
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,330
I knew she did not want me around, and I wanted
her to think that it did not matter.

50
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,320
But it did.

51
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,630
It did.

52
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,630
I did not understand the way my mother felt
about her, either.

53
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:08,200
As I grew a year or two older, she told me
not to go into the woods with Missiya.

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,501
Suddenly one hot afternoon mother called me
from the garden and said, very firmly, 'You

55
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,370
must not see Missiya again.

56
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,930
You're not a child any longer - you must stop
bothering her to play with you.'

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,850
I couldn't understand why.

58
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,160
I didn't say anything.

59
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,650
I stood by my mother and looked out of that
sun-filled room.

60
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,460
In the garden I saw the purple bougainvillea
and the bright yellow hibiscus flowers.

61
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,340
I wanted to be out there playing with Missiya.

62
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,820
There was no one to play with except Missiya.

63
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,300
And now my mother was telling me I must not
play with her!

64
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,270
'Then who will make me a mud house when it
rains?'

65
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,270
I asked my mother, confused.

66
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,350
Mother knew me.

67
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,680
She heard the anxiety in my voice and said
quietly, without even lifting her eyes from

68
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,250
the book she was reading, 'I will.'

69
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,460
Missiya did not miss me.

70
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,200
She did not care at all that she had ended
a handful of my dreams.

71
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,270
She continued to laugh her way through the
days, the months.

72
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,960
She became more beautiful as the years passed
and her lovely body became more rounded.

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,560
There was a bolder look in her eyes and a
wildness in her movements that drove the men

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,420
crazy.

75
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,520
There were violent arguments in the village.

76
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,640
Like the night when old Appuhamy's wife went
to search for him and found him inside Missiya's

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
house, drunk.

78
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,430
The whole village gathered to watch and cheer,
although it was well past midnight.

79
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,520
All the women cursed Missiya, and the men
watched her with a new interest.

80
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,900
Missiya did not show the least concern.

81
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:18,180
She spat an enormous mouthful of betel juice
towards them and disappeared into the night.

82
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,400
They said that she was a witch.

83
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,650
But by now I was old enough to know that she
was no witch.

84
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,090
She was human and soon enough I knew what
she was.

85
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,860
I began to understand what those trips into
the woods meant.

86
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,300
I knew the meaning of those violent arguments.

87
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,330
I knew why some women hated her and cursed
her.

88
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:50,090
I began to understand why women like my mother
wanted to protect their daughters from her

89
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,770
influence and their sons from her clever tricks.

90
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,150
But Missiya herself was one of the world's
lucky ones.

91
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,390
She didn't care what anyone said.

92
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,730
She didn't care what happened to anyone.

93
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,030
She cared only about one person in the whole
world and that was herself.

94
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,150
Perhaps, in a way, that did make her a witch.

95
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,040
At least she was not quite human.

96
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,720
That thoughtless confidence of hers couldn't
last, however.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Almost ten years later, she came to live in
a dark little hut that stood just beyond the

98
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,440
end of our garden.

99
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,969
By then she had begun to lose the freshness
of her young beauty and her carefree ways.

100
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:51,809
At twenty-five she was an adult woman, a good-looking
woman, and an inviting one.

101
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:58,370
She lived alone because her parents had died,
but nothing else had changed with her.

102
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,149
The village still hated her and loved her.

103
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,670
The men still came to her by night.

104
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,540
During the day she worked, making baskets.

105
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,809
Day or night, she appeared not to care how
the next meal came to her, what happened to

106
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:20,519
her, or what she would do when she grew old.

107
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,029
When I met her for the first time after many
years away, I was shy.

108
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,010
She smiled at me as I walked past her little
house.

109
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,879
'Well, well, how you've grown!'

110
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,570
she said with her usual bold smile.

111
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,740
I said something in reply and hurried away.

112
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,089
In the rapid look I gave her, I saw the heaviness
of her body, and wondered if she was getting

113
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,199
fat.

114
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,269
There was something about her that seemed
different.

115
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:01,699
I looked back and saw her watching me.

116
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:06,399
She had a look of catlike happiness on her
face that day.

117
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,350
'Has she met some man and married him?'

118
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,389
I wondered as I walked towards my parents'
home.

119
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:20,420
But soon enough I knew she was not married.

120
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:27,339
The village now felt sorry for her - she was
a woman growing old before her time.

121
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,240
The men did not come to her for their pleasures
as much as before.

122
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,259
The village was moving into the modern world
- just two miles away there was now a cinema,

123
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,559
and after the late-night showing there were
women available there too.

124
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:48,949
So Missiya was finding it hard to earn enough
money even for food.

125
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:56,980
The village talked and laughed unkindly about
her: how poor she was, how little she had.

126
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,629
Her clothes were unwashed, her habits dirty.

127
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:08,999
It seemed that the world's oldest profession
did not pay very well.

128
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:13,399
The morning it happened started like any other.

129
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,720
The sun shone and the raindrops danced on
the wet grass.

130
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,839
I walked down to the edge of the garden, reliving
the pleasures of my childhood.

131
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:31,560
These trips back to the village filled me
with confused thoughts - a wish for past days,

132
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,709
past magic, when the world and I were young...

133
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:42,310
The old tree where I had sat in the shade,
and cried desperate tears over some young

134
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,959
sadness or other, was still there.

135
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,129
So was the dead tree trunk where my friends
and I had sat on so many golden evenings and

136
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:53,850
watched the sun go down.

137
00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:01,639
The voices from the past whispered in my ear,
some long gone from my life...

138
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,329
The cool air was still so well-known and dear
to me.

139
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:11,860
And the morning sun gave a silver touch to
the rice field spread out at my feet.

140
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,660
I stopped with a start when I saw the two
policemen.

141
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,259
They looked towards our house and then looked
away.

142
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,269
I took a step backwards and watched them.

143
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,470
They spoke to each other and entered the large
shed in which the hay was stored.

144
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,560
It was early morning.

145
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,480
There was no one else around.

146
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,839
And quietly the village began to wake up.

147
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:50,499
First, the old businessman, the Mudalali,
clearing his throat and walking to the corner

148
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:53,860
to get his morning newspaper.

149
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,499
He was followed by the young man who worked
in the tea shop.

150
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:03,309
Then the women appeared, wanting to know what
was happening.

151
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:07,550
Suddenly there was a crowd, and excitement
in the air.

152
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:14,369
And then the policemen brought out the terrible
bundle from inside the building.

153
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:18,620
I shut my eyes and turned away.

154
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,399
It was such a tiny bundle, a helpless little
thing, killed by its own mother and hidden

155
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,790
in the hay.

156
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,230
It had no father who would accept it as his
child.

157
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,649
So it had to die.

158
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,110
A fatherless baby in that little village was
a terrible thing, and women like its mother

159
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,819
were cursed, perhaps even killed.

160
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:53,739
In that lovely little village, with its sunny
green fields and blue hills, there was no

161
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:57,529
room for that child.

162
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:01,070
And then they brought out the mother.

163
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,699
She didn't hide her head guiltily, as they
wanted her to.

164
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:12,639
She still held her head high, and looked straight
at all of us.

165
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:20,449
I hid behind a tree and watched her - I still
couldn't take my eyes off her.

166
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:27,649
She looked at the silent crowd and then she
noticed me.

167
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,079
She smiled at me, bold and direct, as always.

168
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,649
I shut my eyes.

169
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,139
She didn't care that I gave her no answering
smile.

170
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:46,779
She turned to the crowd with the same bold
smile, and spat an enormous mouthful of betel

171
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,459
juice towards them.

172
00:14:49,459 --> 00:15:10,629
And then she went away with the policemen.

173
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:11,600
- THE END -
