CHAPTER ONE
Sir Walter Elliot

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,330
Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall in Somerset,
south-west England, never read anything except

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,430
the Baronetage. He particularly liked to read
the pages about his own family:

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:29,330
Walter Elliot, baronet, born 1 March 1760,
married Elizabeth Stevenson 15 July 1784.

5
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:40,180
Three daughters: Elizabeth (born 1 June 1785),
Anne (born 9 August 1787), and Mary (born

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:51,790
20 November 1791, married Charles Musgrove
16 December 1810). A still-born son (5 November

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:00,690
1789). Lady Elliot died in 1800. Heir presumptive:
William Walter Elliot, the great grandson

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,980
of the second Sir Walter.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,450
This introduction was followed by the history
of the Elliot family: three hundred years

10
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:17,459
of respectability. Reading it gave Sir Walter
great satisfaction. Vanity was his principal

11
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,810
characteristic: he was vain about his noble
family and his good looks. At fifty-four he

12
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,990
was still a handsome man. His friends had
been surprised that he had never married again.

13
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,219
He could have asked Lady Russell to marry
him. She was a widow who lived nearby and

14
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:42,489
had been Lady Elliot's closest friend. However,
thirteen years had passed since Lady Elliot's

15
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:49,369
death, and Sir Walter and Lady Russell were
still just good friends and neighbours.

16
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,799
Sir Walter's favourite daughter was Elizabeth.
She was twenty-nine, but she was still very

17
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,459
good-looking. Anne was twenty-six and had
been pretty a few years before, but now she

18
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:10,170
was pale and thin. Mary had grown fat since
her marriage. Lady Russell had deep lines

19
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,739
around her eyes. Sir Walter took great pleasure
in thinking that of all the people he knew

20
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:24,120
only he and Elizabeth were still as good-looking
as ever. Elizabeth will marry a great nobleman,

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,219
he thought, and he did not notice that he
had been thinking it for the past thirteen

22
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,579
years.

23
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:37,090
When Elizabeth was sixteen, she had planned
to marry her father's heir William Walter

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,510
Elliot. That was the only way she could keep
her father's property. When she met the young

25
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,989
man, she liked him. He was invited to Kellynch
Hall, but he never came. A year later, he

26
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:58,330
married a rich woman from a middle-class family.
Elizabeth was angry and upset. Her life went

27
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,069
on rather emptily. She went to elegant parties
and visited friends. She tried to fill the

28
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,680
time, but it was difficult, since she had
no talents or interests.

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Recently she had been worried about her father:
he was in debt. Neither Elizabeth nor her

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,079
father could imagine how to pay these debts.
Both felt that their extravagant lifestyle

31
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:29,579
was essential to the dignity of a noble family.
Lady Russell and Anne spent hours trying to

32
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,689
find a way to save money and pay the debts,
but every plan for economy they proposed was

33
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:43,219
rejected by Sir Walter. Finally he accepted
the radical plan of moving to the town of

34
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:51,409
Bath. There he could live for less money without
losing his dignity. Meanwhile, Kellynch Hall

35
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:56,560
was rented to a gentleman called Admiral Croft.

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,659
When Sir Walter's lawyer Mr Shepherd had completed
the business arrangements with Admiral Croft,

37
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,040
he came to Kellynch to report to Sir Walter.

38
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,489
'Admiral Croft is very nice,' said Mr Shepherd.
'His wife's brother lived in the nearby village

39
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:21,970
of Monkford a few years ago. Perhaps you know
the gentleman. Now, what was his name?' Mr

40
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,550
Shepherd searched his memory but couldn't
remember the name of Mrs Croft's brother.

41
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,960
'He lived in the grey stone house...'

42
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,870
After a moment, Anne said, 'I suppose you
mean Mr Wentworth.'

43
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:47,610
'Ah!' said Sir Walter. 'The curate of Monkford.
When you said "gentleman" I thought you meant

44
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:54,289
a man of property, somebody of the nobility.
Mr Wentworth was nobody.'

45
00:04:54,289 --> 00:05:01,229
Anne left the room quietly and went out into
the garden. As she walked between the tall

46
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:07,090
trees, she thought, 'In a few months, perhaps
he will be here!'

47
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,080
She was thinking of the curate's brother - Captain
Frederick Wentworth of the Royal Navy - who

48
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,230
had spent the year 1806 in Monkford. At that
time, he was a handsome, clever, charming

49
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:27,160
young man, and Anne was a pretty, gentle,
sensitive girl. They fell in love and were

50
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,379
happy for a short period, but, when Frederick
asked Sir Walter if he could marry Anne, Sir

51
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:40,199
Walter was not pleased. He thought that Frederick's
family was not good enough. Even Lady Russell,

52
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,220
who was much more sensible than Sir Walter,
disapproved. Anne was Lady Russell's favourite

53
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,789
of the Elliot sisters; only Anne had the gentleness,
good sense and modesty that Lady Russell had

54
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:58,400
loved so much in her old friend Lady Elliot.
Lady Russell thought that it was foolish for

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,759
Anne to marry a young man with no money. 'When
your father dies,' she had said, 'he'll leave

56
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:12,129
you very little money and no property. You
need to marry someone rich and so does Captain

57
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,400
Wentworth. If you marry each other, you'll
have no money at all, and you'll both be miserable

58
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,229
as a result.'

59
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:25,460
Anne was too gentle to argue against this.
She broke off her engagement to Frederick,

60
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:32,600
convinced that it was the best thing for him.
Frederick was angry and hurt. 'I'm sure that

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,050
I'll earn money and promotion in the Navy,'
he said, but Anne continued to resist him,

62
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:46,129
and finally he went to sea. That was eight
years ago, when Anne was nineteen. Very few

63
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,930
people knew about the relationship between
them: his sister Mrs Croft had been abroad

64
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,659
with her husband at the time, and Anne's sister
Mary had been away at school. Captain Wentworth

65
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,919
had never returned to Monkford, because his
brother had moved away.

66
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,820
In the eight years since Captain Wentworth
had left, Anne had never fallen in love with

67
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:14,120
anyone else. Mr Charles Musgrove had asked
her to marry him, but she had refused, and

68
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,980
he had married her sister Mary instead. Anne
read about Captain Wentworth's career in the

69
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,900
newspapers. He had been right: his Navy career
was a great success. By now he must be quite

70
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,759
rich, thought Anne sadly. He had never married.
Thinking about it now, Lady Russell's advice

71
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,949
seemed too cautious: Anne thought she was
being prudent, but instead she had ruined

72
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,949
her life.

73
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:43,949
***

74
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,610
Mary lived at Uppercross, three miles from
Kellynch Hall. One day she said to her sister

75
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,909
Elizabeth, 'When you go to Bath, please leave
Anne with me. I'm not well, and I need Anne's

76
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:55,909
help.'

77
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:01,159
'All right,' said Elizabeth. 'No one will
miss her in Bath!'

78
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,569
Elizabeth's friend Mrs Clay - a young widow
- was going to Bath with them. Elizabeth was

79
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,610
perfectly happy with the thought of her father
and her friend as her only companions.

80
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,009
Anne was also happy with the arrangement and
gladly accepted Mary's invitation. She did

81
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,340
not like Bath. She much preferred to stay
in the country close to Lady Russell, who

82
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,200
appreciated her. She and Mary did not enjoy
each other's company, but at least Mary valued

83
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,880
her help, and this way she did not have to
go to Bath.

84
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,350
There was only one problem with the plan:
the idea of Mrs Clay staying for months with

85
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:46,510
Elizabeth and Sir Walter at their house in
Bath made Anne worried. Mrs Clay was not a

86
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,070
pretty woman, but she was intelligent and
friendly. Anne thought it imprudent to let

87
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,590
a pleasant young single woman stay in the
house with Sir Walter for so long a period.

88
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:04,480
She told Elizabeth this, but Elizabeth replied,
'Nonsense! Father doesn't find Mrs Clay attractive.

89
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,850
Besides, she isn't from a noble family. There's
no danger.'

90
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,670
So Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay left
for Bath, and Anne moved into Mary's house.

91
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,670
Mary lived in the Cottage, the smaller of
two houses on a large property owned by her

92
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,870
husband's parents. Mr and Mrs Musgrove Senior
lived in the Great House. Anne and Mary spent

93
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,410
a lot of time with Mr and Mrs Musgrove and
their daughters Henrietta and Louisa. They

94
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,230
were rather pretty, lively, fashionable girls,
who were very popular in the neighbourhood.

95
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,560
They seemed to enjoy life a lot, but the only
thing Anne was envious of was their friendly

96
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,630
feeling towards each other - this was very
different from Anne's relationship with either

97
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,700
of her sisters.

98
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,950
CHAPTER TWO
Captain Wentworth

99
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,260
When Admiral Croft and his wife arrived at
Kellynch Hall, Mary and Charles invited them

100
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,900
to the Cottage. Mr and Mrs Musgrove and their
daughters were also invited.

101
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:19,780
'Dear Mrs Croft,' said Mrs Musgrove, as soon
as the introductions were over, 'did you know

102
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,690
that my son Dick served in the Navy under
your brother Captain Frederick Wentworth?'

103
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,710
'Really?' asked Mrs Croft. 'And what does
your son do now?'

104
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:37,330
'The poor boy died at sea!' cried Mrs Musgrove,
with tears in her eyes.

105
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,850
'Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that,' said Mrs
Croft.

106
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,910
'But in one of his letters to me, he wrote,
"Captain Wentworth is a fine, courageous young

107
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,870
gentleman." Yes, he admired your brother very
much, Mrs Croft!'

108
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,050
In fact, Dick Musgrove had been a stupid,
lazy, difficult young man, so his parents

109
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,190
had sent him to sea. He was as difficult in
the Navy as he had been at home. When he had

110
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:13,190
died two years before, at the age of twenty,
no one except his mother really felt sorry.

111
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:19,600
Mrs Croft, who was a sensible, confident,
straightforward lady, tried to comfort Mrs

112
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Musgrove.

113
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,860
'My brother will be very glad to meet you,
Mrs Musgrove,' said Mrs Croft. 'His career

114
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,860
in the Navy has been a great success. Now
that the war is over he's back in England.

115
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,630
He's coming to stay with us at Kellynch Hall
next week.'

116
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:44,350
Anne, who was standing nearby, heard this,
and her heart beat fast in agitation.

117
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,350
***

118
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,950
The following week, Henrietta and Louisa came
to visit Anne and Mary at the Cottage.

119
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,550
'We've met Captain Wentworth!' cried Henrietta.
'He's very handsome and charming! Father invited

120
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,080
him to dinner this evening.'

121
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,440
'Yes,' cried Louisa. 'You must all come to
meet him!'

122
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,240
'I'm afraid we can't,' said Mary. 'My little
boy has a cold. We must stay with him this

123
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
evening.'

124
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,490
'Well, I can go, can't I?' Charles asked Mary.

125
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,360
'If you want!' replied Mary, clearly offended
that her husband did not want to stay with

126
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
her.

127
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,090
'You can both go,' said Anne. 'I'll stay here
with little Charles.'

128
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:33,560
'What a good idea!' cried Mary, suddenly happy
again.

129
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,460
Charles and Mary went to the Great House and
Anne remained at the Cottage. All evening

130
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,300
she thought about the dinner at the Great
House. There, Frederick Wentworth was smiling

131
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:53,951
and talking to other people. How does he feel,
she wondered, about meeting me again? Sooner

132
00:12:53,951 --> 00:13:02,300
or later we will have to meet. Perhaps he
feels indifferent. Or perhaps he'll be embarrassed.

133
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,260
In all these years, he has never tried to
contact me.

134
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,740
Charles and Mary came home late, full of enthusiasm
for Captain Wentworth. 'Such a friendly young

135
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,170
man!' said Mary. 'Charles has invited him
to go shooting tomorrow after breakfast. He

136
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:25,260
invited him to come to breakfast, but Captain
Wentworth was afraid of disturbing little

137
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Charles.'

138
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,020
Anne understood it. He did not want to see
her.

139
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:37,100
'But Anne!' continued Mary. 'He says he knows
you. He says he met you eight years ago, but

140
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,300
I don't remember him at all!'

141
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,900
'No, you were at school then,' said Anne quietly.

142
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,710
The next morning, Henrietta and Louisa walked
down to the Cottage with Captain Wentworth.

143
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:55,830
When Anne saw Captain Wentworth walking towards
the Cottage, she blushed and she could hardly

144
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,390
breathe from nervousness.

145
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:05,930
'Ah!' said Mary. 'Henrietta and Louisa have
come too. They probably want to walk and watch

146
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:12,070
the shooting. If you can stay with little
Charles, Anne, I think I'll go with them.'

147
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,540
'Certainly,' said Anne, in a trembling voice.

148
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:24,040
And suddenly he was there - in the drawing
room. He bowed to her. She curtsied to him.

149
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,630
Her eyes met his briefly then looked away
again. She heard his voice. He made polite

150
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:39,030
conversation with Mary for a few minutes.
And then he was gone - with the Musgrove sisters,

151
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,860
Charles and Mary - and Anne was left alone
in the drawing room, thinking, 'Thank God

152
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,630
that's over!'

153
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,630
***

154
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,930
'Captain Wentworth wasn't very polite to you,
Anne!' said Mary, when she returned. 'As we

155
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,370
left the house, Henrietta asked what he thought
of you, and he said, "She's changed so much

156
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,010
that hardly recognised her."'

157
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:09,890
Mary - being rather insensitive - had no idea
how much pain her words caused her sister.

158
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:18,300
It must be true! thought Anne. But he hasn't
changed. He's just as good-looking as ever.

159
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:26,500
His comment hurt her, but it also made her
calm. If I have changed so much, she thought,

160
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,070
there is no hope that he will love me as he
did before. So be calm, she told herself.

161
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,010
If you can be calm, you will be content.

162
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,010
Surprised by Henrietta's question, Frederick
Wentworth had told the truth, but he had not

163
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:49,660
expected anyone to repeat his comment to Anne.
He had not forgiven Anne Elliot. She had abandoned

164
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,140
him, and, in doing so, she had shown weakness
of character: she had allowed herself to be

165
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:01,460
persuaded by others. He had loved her, and
he had never felt that way again about any

166
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,320
other woman. He had never met another woman
he considered to be equal to her. When he

167
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,730
came to Kellynch, he had been curious to meet
her again, but he thought her power over him

168
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,720
was completely gone.

169
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,530
Now that he was rich and the war was over,
he wanted to settle down with some attractive

170
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,370
young woman. Either of the Musgrove sisters
could win his heart if she wanted to. In fact,

171
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,780
any attractive young lady could do so - except
Anne Elliot. When his sister asked him about

172
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:42,180
his intentions, he said with a laugh, I'm
here, Sophia, to find a wife. Any young lady

173
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,230
can capture me with a little beauty, a few
smiles, and a few compliments about the Navy.'

174
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:56,310
But, later, he gave his sister a serious description
of the kind of wife he wanted: 'The woman

175
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:06,420
marry must have a strong mind and a sweet
manner.' He had not entirely forgotten Anne.

176
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
***

177
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,419
From then on, Anne was often in Frederick
Wentworth's company, though never alone with

178
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:17,189
him. It was strange to spend hours in the
same room with him, listening to his voice,

179
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,009
yet never looking at him closely or talking
to him intimately. Once they had been everything

180
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,079
to each other, but now they were just acquaintances.

181
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,470
'Tell us about your adventures at sea, Captain
Wentworth,' cried Louisa one evening. 'You

182
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,330
said that your first ship was called the Asp.
Did you have any adventures on the Asp?'

183
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:47,049
'Oh, certainly I did,' replied the captain.
'It was 1806. That year I had a strong desire

184
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:54,879
to go to sea, and the Navy gave me the Asp.
It was an old ship, but a fine one. That autumn,

185
00:17:54,879 --> 00:18:00,570
we captured a French ship and brought it into
Plymouth harbour. As we approached Plymouth,

186
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,720
a terrible storm hit us and continued for
four days. The Asp was already damaged from

187
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,950
our battles with the French. I thought that
was the end for me and the Asp! I said to

188
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:20,210
myself, "We'll probably go down to the bottom
of the sea together this time!" But, as I

189
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:27,549
said, she was a fine old ship, and we finally
got to the port alive and well.'

190
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:33,690
Henrietta and Louisa cried out in pity and
horror, while Anne silently shivered at the

191
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,940
terrible thought of him going down to the
bottom of the sea.

192
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:46,460
'Your next ship was the Laconia, wasn't it?'
said Mrs Musgrove. 'How lucky for us, sir!'

193
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:53,340
Frederick looked confused until Henrietta
whispered to him. 'She's thinking of my brother

194
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
Dick.'

195
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,600
'Ah!' said Frederick. There was something
in his face at that moment that suggested

196
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,100
to Anne that his memories of Dick were not
happy ones. No one else noticed that look:

197
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,059
only someone who knew him very well could
have noticed it. He crossed the room, sat

198
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:17,529
on the sofa beside Mrs Musgrove, and spoke
to her quietly and seriously about her son.

199
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:24,539
Anne, meanwhile, sat on the other side of
Mrs Musgrove, thinking, We're on the same

200
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,870
sofa!

201
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:32,679
However, when he got up to leave, he bowed
to Anne with cold politeness, like someone

202
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:40,120
who hardly knew her, and said, 'Good evening.'

203
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,230
CHAPTER THREE
Henrietta or Louisa?

204
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:52,370
The Musgroves were cousins of the Hayters
of Winthrop. Winthrop was a large farm two

205
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:59,960
miles from Uppercross, and the Hayter family
were, for the most part, plain ignorant people.

206
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,649
For this reason, Mary was very unhappy that
they were connected to the Musgrove family.

207
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:11,659
She spoke to them as little as possible and
never went to Winthrop.

208
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:16,820
Charles Hayter, the eldest son, was better
educated and more gentlemanly than his father

209
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,700
and his brothers. He was a curate and, over
the past year or so, he and Henrietta had

210
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,230
seemed to be in love with each other.

211
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:33,480
He was away on business at the time Captain
Wentworth came to Kellynch. When he returned,

212
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,610
after two weeks, he found that everything
had changed. Henrietta did not look at him

213
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:47,499
with loving eyes anymore or listen attentively
when he spoke. Both she and Louisa gave all

214
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:51,710
their attention to Captain Wentworth.

215
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,690
Everyone at Uppercross seemed to be charmed
by the captain, but Charles Hayter did not

216
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,340
find him charming at all.

217
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
***

218
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,190
One evening, when they were alone in their
room, Mary said to her husband Charles, 'Captain

219
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,101
Wentworth seems to like your sisters very
much. He spends a lot of time with them. Do

220
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:15,600
you think he'll marry one of them?'

221
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,250
'Maybe,' said Charles. 'I think perhaps he'll
marry Louisa.'

222
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:27,690
'Well, Louisa is the livelier of the two,
but Henrietta is prettier,' said Mary.

223
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:35,279
'True,' her husband replied, 'but I think
Henrietta is already in love - with her cousin

224
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,980
Charles Hayter.'

225
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:44,659
'Oh dear, I hope not!' cried Mary. 'That Hayter
family is so common! We really don't want

226
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:48,480
to be any more closely connected to them than
we already are.'

227
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,190
'But Charles is in a good position,' said
her husband. 'He's the eldest son, so he will

228
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,299
inherit Winthrop. And he's a curate. He'll
probably become curate of the church of Uppercross

229
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,110
when the old vicar retires.'

230
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:11,610
'Well, I hope that Henrietta will marry Captain
Wentworth instead,' said Mary. 'He's a fine

231
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:20,020
young man, and I hear that he made twenty-five
thousand pounds during the war. That's a splendid

232
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
fortune.'

233
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
***

234
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,379
The next day, Louisa, Henrietta, Captain Wentworth,
Mary, Charles and Anne went for a long walk

235
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:36,999
together. Mary got tired very early in the
walk and began to complain. They climbed a

236
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:44,799
hill to see the view. There, below them, was
Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity.

237
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:52,080
'I had no idea that we were walking towards
Winthrop!' cried Mary. 'Let's go back now.

238
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm tired.'

239
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,799
Henrietta had known the direction of their
walk; in fact, she and Louisa had chosen to

240
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:06,080
walk towards Winthrop in the hope of seeing
their cousin Charles Hayter. He had not been

241
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,490
to visit them at Uppercross for days, and
Henrietta had begun to feel sorry about paying

242
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,270
so much attention to Captain Wentworth and
so little attention to her cousin. She looked

243
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:25,559
down at Winthrop sadly, and, not seeing her
cousin, she replied to Mary, 'All right,'

244
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,539
and turned to walk back to Uppercross.

245
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:35,950
'No!' cried Charles and Louisa. Louisa whispered
something in her sister's ear, then Charles

246
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,690
said, 'Henrietta and I shall go down and say
hello to the Hayters. You can wait for us

247
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,320
here. We won't be long.'

248
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,909
Captain Wentworth and Louisa went for a walk.
Anne found a place for Mary to sit down and

249
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:59,440
rest, but Mary refused and went off to find
herself a more comfortable seat. Anne was

250
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,360
very tired too, so she sat down and waited
quietly for the others to return. After a

251
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,220
while, she heard Louisa's voice on the other
side of the hedge.

252
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,840
'And so, I made Henrietta go. I knew that
she wanted to go to Winthrop to see her cousin,

253
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:25,009
but she's so weak - she always lets herself
be persuaded by other people. When Mary said

254
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:31,460
we should go home, she agreed! Even though
she wanted to see her cousin! I never let

255
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,269
myself be persuaded by other people. Once
I have decided what I want to do, no one can

256
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,309
persuade me to do something else!'

257
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:47,070
Then Frederick spoke: 'She's very fortunate
to have you to help her!' he said. 'If your

258
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,049
sister and Mr Hayter are in love, they must
be strong; they can't let other people influence

259
00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:00,249
them. Your sister's very nice, but I see now
that you have the stronger character!'

260
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:06,389
Anne sat very still, afraid of being seen
by the two people on the other side of the

261
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:07,389
hedge.

262
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:14,220
'Well, I never let Mary tell me what to do!'
Louisa replied. 'She's so proud and snobbish.

263
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,749
I wish Anne was Charles's wife instead. Do
you know that Charles wanted to marry Anne?'

264
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:27,139
After a moment's pause, Frederick said, 'Did
she refuse him?'

265
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:32,769
'Yes. Mother and Father think that her friend
Lady Russell persuaded her to refuse. She

266
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:38,279
thought that Charles wasn't good enough for
Anne because he doesn't read poetry...'

267
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:46,179
Their voices became quieter as they walked
further away. Anne sat still, hardly breathing.

268
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:52,149
Now she knew what Captain Wentworth thought
of her: everything he had said about strength

269
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:58,159
of character and weakness, about allowing
yourself to be persuaded by others, made that

270
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:07,240
perfectly clear. He had also shown a curiosity
about her which made her heart beat fast.

271
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,669
Charles and Henrietta returned from Winthrop,
bringing Charles Hayter with them. Henrietta

272
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:18,909
and her cousin looked very happy. Clearly
their misunderstanding was over. They began

273
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:25,539
the long walk home: Louisa and Captain Wentworth
walked in front, Henrietta and her cousin

274
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:32,549
behind them, and Charles Musgrove was at the
back with Anne and Mary. Just then, Mr and

275
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,590
Mrs Croft drove up in their carriage.

276
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,759
'Does anyone want a lift to Uppercross?' asked
Mrs Croft. 'I'm afraid we only have space

277
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,369
for one person.'

278
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:50,350
Everyone refused. Henrietta and Louisa were
not tired, and Mary felt offended at not being

279
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,539
asked before the others.

280
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:59,230
'Nobody? Well, enjoy your walk,' said Mrs
Croft, but then Captain Wentworth went up

281
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,259
to the carriage and whispered something to
his sister.

282
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:08,990
'Miss Elliot!' cried Mrs Croft. 'You look
tired. Please come with us.'

283
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:16,860
Anne really was tired. At first she refused,
but the Admiral and Mrs Croft insisted, and

284
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,309
soon she was in the carriage, knowing that
Frederick had worried about her. He had seen

285
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:29,860
that she was tired. She understood him: he
could not forgive her for the past, and he

286
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,909
was now thinking of marrying another woman,
but even so, he could not see her suffer without

287
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,200
wanting to help her.

288
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:48,759
CHAPTER FOUR
Lyme Regis

289
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:54,629
A week later, Captain Wentworth went to Lyme
Regis to see his friend Captain Harville.

290
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:59,860
When he returned, he described the beauties
of the town and surrounding countryside to

291
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
his friends at Uppercross. They all decided
to go to Lyme for two days and stay at an

292
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,640
inn - Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa
and Captain Wentworth.

293
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:12,129
When they arrived they went to the inn, and
then Captain Wentworth took them to Captain

294
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:17,419
Harville's house. Captain Harville was a tall
dark man who had been seriously injured in

295
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:26,210
battle two years before. His face was kind
and friendly, but his injuries had aged him,

296
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,749
and he looked much older than Captain Wentworth,
although they were in fact the same age. He

297
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:41,179
lived with his wife, his children and his
friend Captain Benwick, who had been an officer

298
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:49,950
on the Laconia when Frederick was captain.
Captain Benwick had been engaged to Harville's

299
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,450
sister Fanny, but she had died while Captain
Benwick was at sea. Ever since, he had lived

300
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,570
with the Harvilles as a member of the family.

301
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:06,179
After Fanny's death, Captain Wentworth had
spent an entire week with Captain Benwick,

302
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:14,000
trying to comfort his friend. Anne saw that
the friendships between these three men were

303
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,669
very strong and sincere, and she thought sadly,
'If I had married him, these people would

304
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,249
now be my friends too!'

305
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,369
When they left the Harvilles' house, Louisa
said to Captain Wentworth, 'What splendid

306
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:35,919
friends you have! What kind honest people!
I think the men in the Navy must be the finest

307
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,919
men in England!'

308
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:42,739
They went for a walk by the sea, then returned
to the inn for dinner. Anne was looking very

309
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:48,700
pretty: the cold wind had made her cheeks
pink and her eyes shine. As they entered the

310
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:57,570
inn, a gentleman dressed in black was going
out. He looked at Anne with great admiration,

311
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:05,279
and then stepped to the side politely to let
her pass. He was not a handsome man, but Anne

312
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,960
thought that his face was that of a pleasant
sensible man. Captain Wentworth noticed the

313
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,600
gentleman looking at Anne and asked the waiter
who he was.

314
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:25,110
'That's Mr William Walter Elliot, sir,' the
man replied. 'He has just left us to return

315
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,269
to London.'

316
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:32,259
'What a coincidence!' said Mary. 'My father's
heir was here - in the same inn!'

317
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:33,259
***

318
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:41,899
The next morning they went for a walk by the
sea. It was too windy for the ladies to walk

319
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:48,690
on the top of the sea wall, so they went down
the steps to a path more protected from the

320
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,919
wind. Mary, Anne and Henrietta went down the
steps slowly and carefully, but Louisa asked

321
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,999
Frederick to hold her hands while she jumped
from the top step to the path below.

322
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:00,950
'It's too dangerous,' said Frederick.

323
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:09,450
'Oh, please,' Louisa insisted. 'I want to
jump. Just hold my hands, and I'll jump down.'

324
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:15,129
'I really don't think it's a good idea,' said
Frederick. 'You might fall.'

325
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:20,029
'You can't persuade me!' cried Louisa. 'When
I want to do something, I do it!'

326
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:24,379
So Frederick held her hands and she jumped,
but when she landed on the lower path, she

327
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:33,169
slipped on the wet stone, and she fell and
hit her head. She lay unconscious on the path.

328
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:39,679
Her face went very white and she did not seem
to be breathing.

329
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,679
'She's dead! She's dead!' cried Mary.

330
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,179
Henrietta fainted from the shock. Poor Charles
was trying to comfort his wife and hold Henrietta

331
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,320
up at the same time. Frederick, on his knees
by Louisa's side, cried out, 'Will someone

332
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
help me?'

333
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:53,059
Anne came up to Charles, put her arms around
Henrietta and Mary and said, 'Charles! Go

334
00:31:53,059 --> 00:32:01,989
and help the captain! Quickly! I can take
care of Mary and Henrietta.'

335
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:07,090
Frederick looked up at Charles and said, 'What
shall we do?'

336
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,220
'Go and get a doctor!' cried Anne.

337
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,070
'You're right,' said Frederick. 'You go and
find a doctor, Charles. I'll wait for you

338
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,070
here.'

339
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,990
'Shouldn't we take her to the inn and wait
for the doctor there?' asked Anne.

340
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:29,299
'Good idea!' said Frederick, 'or - wait! - Harville's
house is closer. I'll take her there. Charles,

341
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,759
bring the doctor to Harville's house!'

342
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:40,450
Charles ran off to find a doctor, Frederick
carried Louisa to his friend's house and Anne

343
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:48,490
- with the help of some local people - followed
with Mary and Henrietta. Half an hour later,

344
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,509
the doctor told them that Louisa's injuries
were not serious.

345
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:59,539
'Someone must go and tell her parents what
has happened,' said Frederick.

346
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:04,460
'Please, will you go, Captain,' said Charles.
'I want to stay with my sister.'

347
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,460
'Certainly,' replied Frederick. 'I will take
the other ladies home, but I think Anne should

348
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,070
stay here with you. There's no one more capable
than Anne.'

349
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,120
'Nonsense!' said Mary. 'I should stay with
my husband and his sister! Anne can go home

350
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
with you.'

351
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,179
And so it was decided: Mary and Charles stayed
at the Harvilles' house with Louisa, while

352
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:31,039
Anne, Henrietta and Frederick took the inn's
carriage to Uppercross. In the carriage, Frederick

353
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,265
spoke mostly to Henrietta. Anne sat quietly
beside him and listened. At one point he said,

354
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,929
'I should have stopped her! I should have
insisted! But dear sweet Louisa has such a

355
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,580
strong character: she won't be persuaded by
anyone!'

356
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:50,970
Anne wondered whether he now questioned the
opinions he had expressed so confidently behind

357
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:59,119
the hedge. Perhaps now he realised that, like
other qualities of the mind, strength of character

358
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,370
should have its proportions and limits.

359
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,299
As they approached Uppercross, Henrietta fell
asleep. Frederick then said to Anne in a low

360
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:12,060
voice, 'I've been thinking about what we should
do when we get there. I think it will upset

361
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,210
Henrietta too much to be present when I tell
her parents. Do you think it's a good idea

362
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,660
for you to stay with her in the carriage until
I've told them?'

363
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,200
'Yes, I do,' whispered Anne. She was very
glad that he had asked for her opinion, very

364
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,530
glad that he valued her, thought her capable
and treated her as a friend. It was a great

365
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,860
pleasure to her.

366
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:42,440
When they got to the Great House, Frederick
went in and told Mr and Mrs Musgrove what

367
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:51,230
had happened. Then he came back to the carriage
and helped Henrietta into the house. Finally,

368
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:57,820
he took the carriage back to Lyme, leaving
Anne with the Musgroves.

369
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,820
***

370
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:06,490
The next day, Anne received a letter from
Lady Russell, saying that she was now home

371
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:14,040
in Kellynch and inviting Anne to come and
stay with her. Anne wrote back and told Lady

372
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:22,150
Russell about the accident at Lyme: 'I'm so
glad that you're home. As soon as Mary and

373
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:29,250
Charles get back from Lyme, I'll pack my bags
and come to your house.'

374
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:41,920
She was glad. She had missed her friend. But
at the same time she was worried. What will

375
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,870
Lady Russell think of me spending all that
time in Captain Wentworth's company?

376
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:51,000
Two days later, she was at her friend's house.
'How pretty you look, my dear!' cried Lady

377
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,160
Russell when Anne walked in. 'I haven't seen
you look so well for years!'

378
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Anne was pleased. She remembered the look
of admiration that William Walter Elliot,

379
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,390
her father's heir, had given her at the inn
while he was leaving. 'Perhaps I really am

380
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,390
pretty again!' she thought.

381
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,830
Lady Russell sat down beside Anne and said,
'I hear you've been spending a lot of time

382
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,870
with Captain Wentworth.' She sat waiting for
an answer.

383
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:12,370
'Yes,' replied Anne, trying not to seem agitated.
'He came to see the Musgroves almost every

384
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:20,200
day, so of course I saw him often. I think
he is in love with Louisa.'

385
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:32,330
'Really?' said Lady Russell, and she thought,
with angry pleasure, 'How can a man who once

386
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,910
appreciated the value of Anne Elliot, now,
eight years later, possibly be charmed by

387
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,910
Louisa Musgrove?'

388
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,180
'Well,' Lady Russell continued, 'Admiral and
Mrs Croft have gone to visit friends in the

389
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,890
north, so he probably won't come back to this
neighbourhood. I think Mrs Croft said he was

390
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,870
going to stay with his brother in Shropshire.'

391
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,870
'Oh!' said Anne.

392
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,870
CHAPTER FIVE
Bath

393
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:57,590
Anne stayed at Lady Russell's house in Kellynch
for a month, then they both went to Bath.

394
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,591
Lady Russell had rented a house for herself
there. Anne wished she could stay with her

395
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:07,290
friend, but she had to stay at her father's
house with Elizabeth and Mrs Clay. When they

396
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,660
arrived, Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay
seemed to be in good spirits and welcomed

397
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,640
Anne more warmly than she had expected. Elizabeth
told them that William Walter Elliot had been

398
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:24,910
visiting them often over the past two weeks.
He was in Bath, staying with his friend Colonel

399
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,260
Wallis and his wife and new baby.

400
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:35,210
'It's surprising that he visits you so often!'
said Lady Russell. 'I've never liked the man

401
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,630
because he showed no respect for the family.
He never came to see you while his wife was

402
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:46,560
alive. I suppose, now that she is dead, he
is beginning to value his family.'

403
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,020
Anne was slightly confused. When she had seen
him in Lyme, she had thought that Mr Elliot

404
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:59,850
seemed a sensible man. Why, Anne asked herself,
is he so interested in making friends with

405
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:10,190
the family now, after all these years? She
thought perhaps it was for Elizabeth. Certainly

406
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,460
Elizabeth herself and Mrs Clay thought so.

407
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:20,920
That evening, Mr William Walter Elliot came
to visit. When he saw Anne, his face showed

408
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,620
surprise and pleasure. 'My dear cousin!' he
said. 'I saw you just a few weeks ago at Lyme,

409
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,330
but I had no idea that it was you!'

410
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:39,230
He sat between Anne and Lady Russell. His
manners were very pleasant. He asked Anne

411
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,490
why she had been in Lyme, and when she mentioned
the accident he was interested and sympathetic

412
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,710
- he wanted to know every detail. Then he
spoke to Lady Russell about the years in which

413
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:59,280
there had been no communication between himself
and Sir Walter. 'It was all a misunderstanding,'

414
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:06,030
he said. 'I thought I had offended him, that
he didn't want to see me anymore. But now

415
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:13,640
I realise that was a mistake. I'm so sorry
that I missed all those years of his company!'

416
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:22,360
After he left, Lady Russell cried, 'What a
nice man! Is this really the same Mr Elliot?

417
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:29,830
I used to dislike him, but now he seems completely
admirable: he's intelligent, sophisticated,

418
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:36,500
polite and friendly. He has the right opinions
and strong family feelings.'

419
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:46,340
Anne went to bed that night with a smile on
her face: her first evening in Bath had been

420
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
surprisingly pleasant.

421
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
***

422
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:54,130
The only thing that disturbed Anne's first
few days in Bath was her fear that her father

423
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,030
was falling in love with Mrs Clay.

424
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:03,090
When Mrs Clay was in the room with him, he
talked to her a lot, and when she was out

425
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:10,480
of the room he referred to her often: 'Mrs
Clay thinks' this and 'Mrs Clay says' that.

426
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:19,680
One evening, when Mr William Walter Elliot
and Lady Russell were visiting them, Sir Walter

427
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,740
and Elizabeth spoke with great enthusiasm
about Sir Walter's cousin Lady Dalrymple.

428
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:30,820
'She has come to Bath and has rented a beautiful
house in Laura Place, which is of course the

429
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:37,050
best street in town,' said Sir Walter. 'Since
we are cousins, I called on her immediately

430
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,340
and she invited us to tea.'

431
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,722
'Yes,' said Elizabeth, 'She's a really charming
lady, and her carriage is the most splendid

432
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:45,722
one in Bath!'

433
00:40:45,722 --> 00:40:50,060
Anne was embarrassed. She had never seen her
father and sister in contact with nobility

434
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:57,520
before, and she felt ashamed of them. Usually
she considered them too proud - too conscious

435
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,980
of their own position in society and snobbish
towards anyone they considered inferior. But

436
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:09,070
now, for the first time, she wished they had
more pride. She wished they did not show so

437
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:18,000
openly how important it was to them for Lady
Dalrymple to recognise them and treat them

438
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,840
as equals. Lady Dalrymple was pleasant enough,
but she was nothing special. She was not intelligent

439
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:36,350
or cultured. Certainly she smiled at everyone,
but the only reason Elizabeth called her 'charming'

440
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,440
was because she was a wealthy aristocrat.

441
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:50,900
Mr Elliot turned to Anne and said in a low
voice, 'I'm so glad that Sir Walter has found

442
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,120
good company in Bath.'

443
00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:00,800
Anne smiled and replied, 'My idea of good
company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever

444
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,120
well-educated people who can make interesting
conversation.'

445
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:12,760
'You're mistaken,' he said gently. 'That is
not good company; that is the best. To be

446
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,870
good company, you need only to be from a respectable
family and have nice manners.'

447
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,960
'Well,' said Anne, 'I'm proud of my family,
and I don't like to see them trying so hard

448
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,610
to be friendly with Lady Dalrymple simply
because she's an aristocrat.'

449
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:28,650
'We agree on one thing, at least,' replied
Mr Elliot. 'I too am proud of my family, and

450
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,100
I would rather see Sir Walter being friendly
with Lady Dalrymple than with others who are

451
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,090
below him.' He glanced at Mrs Clay.

452
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:50,260
Although Anne was sure that Mr Elliot's pride
was different from hers, she was glad that

453
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,150
he did not like Mrs Clay.

454
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,150
***

455
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,760
The following week, they were all invited
to Lady Dalrymple's house. Anne said that

456
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,880
she could not go, because she had already
made plans to visit a friend of hers - Mrs

457
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:16,120
Smith. They had been at school together years
ago, but now Mrs Smith was a poor widow. Her

458
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:23,250
husband, Mr Smith, had been wealthy but had
lost all his money. Now Mrs Smith had very

459
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:32,150
little money to live on, and she was in bad
health. Sir Walter thought that Anne was foolish

460
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,080
to waste her time with such a person.

461
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,560
The next day, Lady Russell told Anne all about
their evening at Lady Dalrymple's house. 'My

462
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:49,280
dear, Mr Elliot was very sorry that you weren't
there, but he said he admired you for wanting

463
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,240
to visit your old friend. He thinks that you're
an extraordinary young woman; a model of female

464
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,010
excellence! We discussed your virtues for
half an hour!'

465
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,690
Hearing this gave Anne great pleasure, just
as Lady Russell had planned.

466
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,850
Lady Russell had now decided that Mr Elliot
was an excellent gentleman. She was sure that

467
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:12,550
he wanted to marry Anne. She told Anne her
thoughts on the subject. After a moment, Anne

468
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,800
replied, 'Mr Elliot is a nice man, but we
are not compatible.'

469
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,540
'Just think,' said Lady Russell. 'If you marry
Mr Elliot, you will have your dear mother's

470
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,840
name, her position and your old home!'

471
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,160
This vision affected Anne very deeply. Yes,
she would love to be Lady Elliot of Kellynch

472
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:38,620
Hall! But she did not want to marry Mr Elliot.
There was only one man she had ever wanted

473
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:45,080
to marry, and besides, she had doubts about
Mr Elliot's sincerity. He was clever, friendly,

474
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:53,760
interesting and polite, but he was not open.
He had suggested to her that he disliked Mrs

475
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:02,220
Clay, yet he was just as charming to Mrs Clay
as to everyone else. He never expressed anger

476
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:08,850
or pleasure at the good or evil of others.
She preferred people who occasionally made

477
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:11,500
mistakes but were warm-hearted and sincere.

478
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,270
CHAPTER SIX
A Surprise

479
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:22,290
In February, the Crofts came to Bath. When
they arrived, Mrs Croft sent a note to Anne,

480
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:28,400
inviting her to visit them. The same day,
Anne received a letter from Mary.

481
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Dear Anne,

482
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:37,970
I am sorry not to have written for so long,
but now I really must write to tell you some

483
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:44,150
interesting news. Last Tuesday Louisa came
home from Lyme to the Great House here at

484
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:50,450
Uppercross. Mr and Mrs Harville and Captain
Benwick came with her. As soon as they arrived,

485
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:57,280
Captain Benwick asked to speak with Mr Musgrove
in private. What do you think? He asked Mr

486
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:06,600
Musgrove if he could marry Louisa! Mr Musgrove
agreed, and now they are engaged! What a surprise!

487
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,670
We thought that Louisa was going to marry
Captain Wentworth...

488
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:15,010
When she read this, Anne's heart beat fast,
and she blushed at the thought that Captain

489
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,740
Wentworth was now free. She was full of joy!

490
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:28,210
She left the house, with the idea of going
to visit the Crofts, but on the way she met

491
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,210
Admiral Croft.

492
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,780
'Ah, Miss Elliot! What a pleasure to see you!'
said the Admiral. 'Do you have time to take

493
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:40,100
a little walk with me? I have some news for
you.'

494
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:47,460
'Certainly,' said Anne. 'I'm so glad that
you and Mrs Croft have come to Bath. What

495
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,910
is the news?'

496
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:55,930
'It's Miss Louisa Musgrove,' he said. 'I thought
that Sophia's brother Frederick was going

497
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:02,910
to marry her, but now it seems she's going
to marry James Benwick!'

498
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:11,390
'Really?' said Anne. 'I hope that this hasn't
caused problems between Captain Wentworth

499
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,360
and Captain Benwick. They are such good friends.'

500
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:21,450
'I don't think so,' said the Admiral. 'Frederick
wrote and told us all about it. He didn't

501
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:28,530
seem angry or disappointed. Perhaps we were
all mistaken in thinking he was in love with

502
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:36,870
her. After her accident, you know, we thought
he would stay in Lyme until she was better,

503
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:42,420
but after two weeks he went off to stay with
his brother in Shropshire. If he was thinking

504
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,260
of marrying her, he'll have to start all over
again with somebody else! I think we should

505
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,829
invite him to stay with us in Bath.'

506
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:48,829
***

507
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:53,560
In fact, while Anne was taking her walk with
Admiral Croft, Captain Wentworth was already

508
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:01,220
on his way to Bath, and, the next time Anne
went out, she saw him. She was walking with

509
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:07,330
Mr Elliot, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, when suddenly
she saw Captain Wentworth walking towards

510
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:12,480
them with some of his Navy friends and their
wives. She felt confused, lost and embarrassed

511
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,950
about her own feelings, which were somewhere
between delight and misery.

512
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:23,050
Captain Wentworth saw her and immediately
went red in the face. He seemed even more

513
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:30,370
confused and agitated by the sight of her
than she was by the sight of him. They stopped

514
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,850
and spoke to each other like polite acquaintances.
Anne noticed that Elizabeth turned away, as

515
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,780
if she did not know him.

516
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:42,860
When Anne and her companions were gone, one
of the ladies in Captain Wentworth's group

517
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,290
said, 'It's clear that Mr Elliot likes his
cousin!'

518
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:56,070
'Yes,' replied another lady, 'He's always
with them, and he always walks with his cousin

519
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,650
Anne. What a good-looking man he is!'

520
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:04,930
'And Anne Elliot is very pretty, if you look
at her closely,' said the first lady. 'Most

521
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,250
people think her sister is prettier, but I
don't.'

522
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,660
Captain Wentworth listened to them in silence
as he walked. He had recognised Mr Elliot

523
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:22,330
immediately from the one time he had seen
him in Lyme.

524
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,330
***

525
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:28,450
Days passed and Anne had no opportunity of
seeing Captain Wentworth. He moved in a different

526
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:35,750
social circle: his friends went to concerts
and the theatre; her friends spent their time

527
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:42,470
in the elegant stupidity of private parties.
But at last there was an opportunity; a special

528
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:46,460
concert that Lady Dalrymple had promised to
attend. Sir Walter, Elizabeth, Mrs Clay, Mr

529
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,130
Elliot, Lady Russell and Anne were all going
with her. Sir Walter, his two daughters and

530
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:59,020
Mrs Clay were the first to arrive at the concert
hall. They stood by the fire in the large

531
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,250
entrance room, waiting for the others.

532
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:06,171
Captain Wentworth walked in alone. He was
simply going to bow and move on, but Anne

533
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:12,840
stepped forward and said 'Hello.' He stopped
and made polite conversation with her. Sir

534
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,130
Walter made a slight bow to Captain Wentworth
and Elizabeth curtsied. Captain Wentworth

535
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:26,840
bowed to them. When they had discussed the
weather, Bath and the concert, there was a

536
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,140
pause in the conversation. Then Captain Wentworth
said, 'Have you heard? Louisa's accident in

537
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,990
Lyme did produce one good result: she's engaged
to be married to Benwick.'

538
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,960
'Yes, I heard,' said Anne.

539
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,270
'I hope they will be very happy,' said the
Captain. 'They have no difficulties at home:

540
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:49,440
Mr and Mrs Musgrove are behaving very honourably
and kindly. They don't oppose the marriage,

541
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,240
even though Louisa could have found a richer
man.'

542
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,610
He stopped speaking suddenly when he noticed
that Anne was blushing and looking at the

543
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:05,160
ground. Then he realised that his words might
seem to refer to their own past. 'I was surprised

544
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,740
by their engagement,' he continued, a little
nervously. 'They are so different. Louisa

545
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:17,530
is a very sweet, friendly girl, and she's
not stupid, but Benwick is something more.

546
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,430
He's a really intelligent man; he reads a
lot and thinks deeply. Fanny Harville was

547
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:30,760
like him in that way. She was an extraordinary
woman and his love for her was real. A man

548
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:38,310
doesn't get over the loss of a woman like
that! I'm surprised that he's able to love

549
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:42,240
someone else at all especially so soon after
Fanny's death.'

550
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,940
Anne was breathing very quickly and feeling
a hundred things at the same time. But they

551
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,630
were in a public place, surrounded by other
people. She tried to bring their conversation

552
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,780
back to everyday things. 'I would like to
go to Lyme again,' she said.

553
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,240
'But you had such a terrible experience there;
I'm surprised you want to go back.'

554
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,150
'My memories of Lyme are not all bad,' said
Anne.

555
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:10,850
Just then, Lady Dalrymple and the others came
in and Anne had to leave the Captain. When

556
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:15,700
they took their seats in the concert hall,
Anne looked around, hoping to see him. Mr

557
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,920
Elliot sat beside her and began talking to
her in a low voice.

558
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:29,040
'I'm so glad I can sit beside you this evening,'
he said. 'On Thursday I'm going to visit some

559
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:37,380
friends in Thornberry and I won't be back
until Friday evening. I'll miss the pleasure

560
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,230
of your company.'

561
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:45,780
The concert opened with some Italian love
songs and the texts were included in the concert

562
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:54,160
programme. Mr Elliot asked Anne to translate
them for him, and she did so. 'You are so

563
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,320
clever!' he said.

564
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,210
'Oh,' replied Anne, 'not really. My Italian
isn't very good.'

565
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,930
'And modest - too modest,' said Mr Elliot.

566
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:08,150
'You've only known me a few weeks,' said Anne.
'You don't know my character well yet.'

567
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:14,550
'Perhaps I know more about you than you think,'
he replied. 'I heard about your character

568
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,420
long before I came to Bath.'

569
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:23,260
'Really?' said Anne, in great surprise. 'Who
spoke about me to you?'

570
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:29,980
'I'll tell you some other time, not now,'
said Mr Elliot. 'For now, all I'll say is

571
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:37,890
that the name Anne Elliot has, for many years,
been an interesting one for me. I hope that

572
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,290
name will never change.'

573
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:43,760
Anne looked away from him in embarrassment.
She did not want to talk to him anymore. She

574
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,520
wished he wasn't sitting next to her.

575
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:54,080
Just then, she heard Lady Dalrymple say to
her father, 'A very fine young man! Who is

576
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
he?'

577
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:01,110
'Captain Wentworth,' Sir Walter replied. 'I
know him only slightly...'

578
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:08,270
Anne looked in the direction in which they
were looking and saw him. He was looking at

579
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:13,260
her. Just as her eyes met his, he looked away.

580
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:19,320
'Mr Elliot!' said Lady Dalrymple during the
interval. 'Come and sit beside me. I want

581
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,320
to ask you something.'

582
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:26,780
To Anne's relief, Mr Elliot moved away. The
seat beside her was now empty, and, after

583
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:32,840
a few minutes, Captain Wentworth came over
to talk to her. He looked unhappy. Something

584
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:39,700
must have happened since they had spoken in
the entrance room. Anne thought that perhaps

585
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:45,070
Lady Russell or her father had glanced at
him in an unpleasant way.

586
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:48,350
'Do you like the concert?' she asked.

587
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:53,560
'No. The music isn't very good,' he replied.
I think I'll leave now.'

588
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,030
'The next song is beautiful. It's worth waiting
for,' said Anne.

589
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,640
'No,' he said, in a voice full of emotion.
'There's no reason for me to stay!'

590
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,930
And he left.

591
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:08,570
He's jealous of Mr Elliot! thought Anne. For
a moment this thought gave her great pleasure.

592
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:14,870
But then she felt hopeless and depressed.
How could she tell him the truth? How could

593
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:20,130
she let him know that she did not care for
Mr Elliot at all?

594
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:21,320
CHAPTER SEVEN
Mrs Smith Tells All

595
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:27,210
The next day, Anne went to visit Mrs Smith.
She was glad to get out of the house. She

596
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:31,080
did not want to see Mr Elliot and he was sure
to visit Sir Walter.

597
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:37,660
'My friend tells me that Mr Elliot is often
at your house,' said Mrs Smith, when they

598
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,800
were sitting in her small room, drinking tea.

599
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,910
'Who is your friend?' asked Anne.

600
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:51,620
'Mrs Rooke. She's a nurse and she works for
Colonel Wallis. You know his wife has just

601
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,620
had a baby.'

602
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,370
'Yes, and Colonel Wallis is Mr Elliot's friend.
Do you know Mr Elliot?'

603
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:02,490
'I used to know him very well,' said Mrs Smith,'but
I haven't seen him for three years now.'

604
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,570
'Did you ever talk about me to him?' asked
Anne.

605
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,050
'Yes, I did. I often spoke about your fine
character, your modesty and intelligence.

606
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:17,270
It was at the time when he met your father
and sister, before his marriage. Speaking

607
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:25,030
of marriage, Mrs Rooke tells me that Mrs Wallis
thinks you will marry Mr Elliot.'

608
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:35,010
'Well,' said Anne, 'Mrs Wallis is mistaken.
Mr Elliot hasn't asked me to marry him, and,

609
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,720
if he did, I would refuse him.'

610
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,160
'I'm glad to hear you're not engaged to him.
You don't know his real character.'

611
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:50,580
'Please tell me about it. I've often wondered
what he was like when he was young.'

612
00:56:50,580 --> 00:57:00,440
Mrs Smith looked at Anne with a serious expression
on her face. 'Mr Elliot is a man without heart

613
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:07,070
or conscience,' she said angrily. 'He thinks
only of himself. My husband was his close

614
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:14,510
friend before we were married, and, after
our marriage, I became his friend too. I thought

615
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:23,280
he was a fine young gentleman then. I remember
when he met your father and sister, and they

616
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:32,040
invited him to Kellynch. He spent the evening
with us afterwards and told us the whole story.

617
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:39,410
He laughed at your father and said he knew
that Sir Walter wanted him to marry his daughter.

618
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:47,420
But he had no money, and he wanted to marry
a rich woman. He knew that he would get Kellynch

619
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:53,530
Hall and the title anyway, even if he didn't
marry Elizabeth. At that time, he didn't care

620
00:57:53,530 --> 00:58:00,840
at all about the honour of his family. He
once said that if titles could be sold, he

621
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,830
would sell his for fifty pounds!'

622
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:14,740
Anne was shocked and angry. 'But why has he
been so friendly to us since he came to Bath?'

623
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,880
she asked.

624
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:22,760
'Ah, well, people change, you see. That was
years ago, when he was a young man. Now he

625
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:31,760
cares a lot about the family honour and the
title. Colonel Wallis told him that Mrs Clay

626
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:39,000
was staying with your sister and that she
was trying to make Sir Walter fall in love

627
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
with her.'

628
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,180
'How do you know? You said you haven't spoken
to him for three years.'

629
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:52,470
'Mrs Rooke again,' replied Mrs Smith. 'You
see, Colonel Wallis tells his wife everything,

630
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:59,320
and Mrs Wallis tells her nurse everything,
and Mrs Rooke very kindly told me. She said

631
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:05,710
that when Mr Elliot heard about Mrs Clay,
he decided to make friends with Sir Walter

632
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:13,420
and separate him from Mrs Clay. He has spoken
to Mrs Clay in private and warned her not

633
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:22,630
to try to win Sir Walter's affections. Mrs
Clay is afraid of him and doesn't want to

634
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:30,480
spend a lot of time with Sir Walter while
Mr Elliot is present. And so he spends as

635
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:39,270
much time as possible with Sir Walter. You
see, Mr Elliot is afraid that Sir Walter might

636
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,840
marry her and have a son. Then he wouldn't
inherit Kellynch Hall.'

637
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,730
'This is terrible!' said Anne.

638
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:51,152
'Yes,' said Mrs Smith. 'As I said, he's a
heartless man, but for me the clearest example

639
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:59,120
of it is the way he treated my poor husband
and the way he has treated me since my husband

640
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:06,370
died. After his marriage, Mr Elliot was very
rich. My husband was never good at managing

641
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:13,090
money, and he was getting into serious financial
difficulties. Mr Elliot did nothing to help

642
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:21,160
him. Before my husband died, he had made Mr
Elliot the executor of his will. If Mr Elliot

643
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:29,360
had tried a bit harder and invested a little
of his own money, my husband's property in

644
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:39,930
the West Indies would now be mine. But he
did nothing, and now the bank owns the property.

645
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:47,220
So you see, it's Mr Elliot's fault that I'm
so poor. I've written him several letters

646
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,810
asking him for help, but he always refuses.
Here are some of the letters I've received

647
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,810
from him.'

648
01:00:53,810 --> 01:01:00,320
Mrs Smith handed Anne a packet of letters.
As she read them, Anne felt more and more

649
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,550
angry: each letter showed coldness and hard-hearted
indifference.

650
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:09,680
As she walked home, Anne thought about her
conversation with Mrs Smith. She wanted to

651
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,670
tell her family immediately, but she knew
that they would not listen to her. She decided

652
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:21,050
that she would tell Lady Russell and ask her
advice.

653
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:28,920
The idea of Mr Elliot's interest in her now
filled her with disgust. At least he was going

654
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:36,910
to be away at Thornberry for two days, and
she would not have to talk to him. She shivered

655
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:43,950
at the thought that Lady Russell might have
persuaded her to marry him. Then she would

656
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:48,170
have discovered his true character when it
was too late!

657
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,170
***

658
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:55,870
When she got home, she found Charles and Mary
there. They had come to Bath for a few days

659
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:02,500
with Captain Harville, Henrietta and Mrs Musgrove.
They were all staying at the White Hart Inn.

660
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:07,280
Anne was surprised and really glad to see
them. Before she left, Mary turned to Anne

661
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:17,630
and said, 'You must come and spend the day
with us at the inn tomorrow. We have so much

662
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:26,730
to talk about, and Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta
want to tell you all about the wedding plans.'

663
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:36,770
The next morning, Anne went to the White Hart.
Captain Wentworth was there visiting his friend

664
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:44,680
Captain Harville. Anne tried to be calm. If
he still loves me and I still love him (which

665
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,050
I certainly do), she thought, surely we'll
understand each other before long.

666
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:55,180
'Anne!' cried Mary, who was standing by the
window. 'Come and look! There's Mrs Clay and

667
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,180
Mr Elliot!'

668
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:02,040
'It can't be,' said Anne, going to the window.
'He's in Thornberry until tomorrow evening.'

669
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,580
Captain Wentworth was looking at her, and
she felt sorry that she had spoken. She turned

670
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:16,780
and looked out of the window, it really was
Mr Elliot. In order to correct any wrong impression

671
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:24,780
her words might have given Captain Wentworth,
she said, 'Oh! It is him. I must have been

672
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,800
mistaken. I wasn't listening very closely
when he spoke about his plans.'

673
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:38,140
Charles went up to Mrs Musgrove and said,
'Mother, I have a surprise for you. I have

674
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:48,390
taken a box at the theatre for tomorrow night.
I know you love the theatre. There's space

675
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:56,220
for nine people. Captain Wentworth says he'll
come, and I know Anne likes the theatre. We

676
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,220
all do.'

677
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:03,880
'Charles!' cried Mary. 'You've forgotten that
my father is giving a party tomorrow night,

678
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:13,420
and we're all invited. Lady Dalrymple will
be there and Mr Elliot, my father's heir.

679
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,820
Surely you want to meet him?'

680
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:21,090
'Why should I?' said Charles. 'Mr Elliot is
nothing to me.'

681
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:29,260
Captain Wentworth had been listening intently
to this conversation. At this last remark,

682
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,381
Captain Wentworth's eyes moved from Charles
to Anne.

683
01:04:33,381 --> 01:04:38,030
Then Mrs Musgrove said to Charles, 'You'd
better go back to the theatre and change the

684
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:42,890
box to Tuesday night. If there's a party at
her father's house, Anne will have to go to

685
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:46,130
it, and we don't want to go to the theatre
without Anne.'

686
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:52,590
'I'd much prefer to go to the theatre than
stay home for my father's party,' said Anne.

687
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:57,590
'But perhaps it would be best to go on Tuesday
instead.'

688
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:06,880
Captain Wentworth came over and sat by Anne.
'Don't you like parties?' he asked.

689
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,250
'No,' she replied.

690
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:18,220
'I remember you didn't use to like them, but
people change over time.'

691
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:26,640
'I haven't changed much,' said Anne, hoping
to suggest to him that her love was unchanged.

692
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,640
But then she realised he might think she meant
the opposite: that she would still refuse

693
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,550
to marry him. She fell silent and blushed
in confusion.

694
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:43,010
'Eight and a half years is a very long time,'
he said.

695
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:49,380
Just then the door opened and Sir Walter,
Elizabeth and Mrs Clay came in.

696
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:55,750
'We've come with invitations to our party,'
said Elizabeth and she handed an invitation

697
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:02,150
to everyone there, including Captain Wentworth.
Captain Wentworth thanked her but did not

698
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:09,020
say whether he would come to the party. After
they had left, he stood staring at the invitation

699
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:14,630
in confusion. Anne understood him. He could
not accept the invitation as an apology for

700
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,970
all their insulting behaviour in the past.

701
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,700
That evening, at home, she thought about these
things a lot. Would Captain Wentworth come

702
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,370
to the party? She had no idea.

703
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:26,520
Turning to Mrs Clay, she said, 'I saw you
talking to Mr Elliot in the street today.

704
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,130
I had thought he was in Thornberry.'

705
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:36,250
'Oh, yes! I forgot to tell you,' said Mrs
Clay. 'I was surprised to see him too. He

706
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:42,760
told me why he hadn't yet left for Thornberry,
but I forget what he said - I wasn't really

707
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,840
listening. I remember he said that he would
definitely be back in time for the party tomorrow.'

708
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,150
CHAPTER EIGHT
A Conversation with Captain Harville

709
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:53,430
Anne spent the next day with her friends at
the White Hart Inn. Captain Wentworth was

710
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:58,840
there too. He asked if he could write a letter.
Mrs Musgrove showed him the writing table

711
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,690
and brought him pen and paper.

712
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:05,780
Captain Harville, who was standing by the
window not far away from Captain Wentworth's

713
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:11,570
table, smiled at Anne. She went and stood
by him. He was holding a small painting, and

714
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:19,180
he showed it to her. 'Do you know who that
is?' he asked.

715
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,990
'Certainly. It's Captain Benwick.'

716
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:25,170
'Yes. And he's giving it to Miss Louisa Musgrove,
but it wasn't painted for her. He had it done

717
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:30,730
for my poor sister, and now he has asked me
to bring it to Bath - he wants to have it

718
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:36,690
framed so that he can give it to another woman!
Captain Wentworth is writing to him now to

719
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,530
tell him when it will be ready. I'm glad that
Benwick has found someone else, but poor Fanny!'

720
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:45,990
he said with strong emotion. 'She wouldn't
have forgotten him so quickly!'

721
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:53,270
'No,' said Anne. 'I don't think any woman
who has truly loved can forget. We don't forget

722
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:59,420
you as soon as you forget us. We live at home,
quietly, with nothing to distract us from

723
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:07,250
our feelings. You always have business of
some sort to take you back into the world

724
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:13,070
immediately. Your lives are filled with activity,
and so it's easier for you to forget.'

725
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:21,029
'But Benwick has not been busy out in the
world,' said Captain Harville. 'He's been

726
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:23,319
living very quietly with us.'

727
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:28,580
'True,' said Anne. 'Well, if it isn't the
result of the differences between men's and

728
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,099
women's lives, it must be the differences
between their natures.'

729
01:08:31,099 --> 01:08:38,670
'No, no. I don't think it's more in man's
nature than in woman's to forget about love.

730
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:43,650
I believe the opposite. Our bodies are stronger
than yours and so are our feelings.'

731
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:49,210
'Your feelings may be stronger,' said Anne,
'but ours are more tender. I too will make

732
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:56,339
a comparison between the mind and the body:
man is more robust than woman, but he doesn't

733
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:57,369
live longer.'

734
01:08:57,369 --> 01:09:04,109
They were interrupted by the sound of Captain
Wentworth's pen falling to the floor. Captain

735
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:08,420
Harville turned to him and asked, 'Have you
finished your letter?'

736
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:13,960
'I'll be five minutes, then we can go,' was
the reply.

737
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:22,020
Then Captain Harville turned back to Anne
and said, 'All literature is against you,

738
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:27,650
you know. Poetry and novels all talk of woman's
inconstancy, but perhaps you'll say they were

739
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,060
all written by men.'

740
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:34,650
'Perhaps I will!' said Anne with a smile.
'It's easier for men to tell their own story.

741
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:39,130
They're much better educated than we are.
No - books prove nothing. We can only speak

742
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:40,329
from our own experience.'

743
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:45,710
'Well, in my experience men suffer a great
deal in love. When a sailor goes to sea, leaving

744
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:50,000
his wife and children behind, wondering if
he'll ever see them again, he suffers greatly.

745
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,319
Then he thinks of them every day until he
returns!'

746
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:58,040
'Oh!' cried Anne. 'I'm sure that's true! I
didn't mean to suggest that only women are

747
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:03,559
capable of true love and loyalty. I only meant
to say that men forget more easily when the

748
01:10:03,559 --> 01:10:10,369
object of their love has gone, but women go
on loving even when there is no hope.' She

749
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:13,480
stopped speaking because she felt too much
emotion to continue.

750
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,790
Captain Wentworth stood up and said to his
friend, 'I've finished. We can go now.'

751
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:15,790
Captain Harville said goodbye to Anne and
went off to say goodbye to Mrs Musgrove. Captain

752
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:16,790
Wentworth looked at her with strong emotion
in his eyes. There were two letters in his

753
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:17,790
hand. He gave her one of them quickly, so
that no one else would see. Then he was gone.

754
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:18,790
Anne looked down at the letter. Her name was
written on the envelope. Her heart beat fast.

755
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:20,010
Her whole happiness depended on the contents
of that letter. She sat down at the writing

756
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,650
desk, opened the letter with a trembling hand,
and read the following words:

757
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:25,119
I cannot listen in silence anymore. Listening
to you, I feel both pain and hope. Tell me

758
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:30,239
that I am not too late! I offer myself to
you again. I love you even more than I did

759
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:38,840
eight and a half years ago, when you broke
my heart. Please do not believe that man forgets

760
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,690
about love sooner than woman. I have loved
no one else. I was angry with you, and I could

761
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:49,090
not forgive you, but I was never inconstant.
I came to Bath because you were here. I think

762
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:56,789
about nothing but you. Have you not noticed?
Do you not see that I love you? I did not

763
01:10:56,789 --> 01:11:01,050
tell you my feelings earlier because I was
afraid you did not love me anymore. Please

764
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:05,050
believe that I have always loved you and I
always will. I have to go now, but I will

765
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:10,119
come back as soon as possible. A word, a look
from you will be enough to tell me whether

766
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:12,980
I enter your father's house this evening or
never.

767
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:13,980
F. W.

768
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:19,710
Anne put the letter down with tears in her
eyes. She had to get out of this room, out

769
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:24,920
of the inn, and away from other people. She
went to Mrs Musgrove and said, 'I'm afraid

770
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,300
I must go home now.'

771
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,230
'Are you ill? You look very pale.'

772
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:31,800
Then Charles came up to Mrs Musgrove and said
he had to go out. 'I have an appointment.

773
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,199
It won't take long. I'll be back in half an
hour.'

774
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:37,900
'All right,' said Mrs Musgrove, 'but Charles,
will you please" take Anne home first? She's

775
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,900
feeling ill.'

776
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,900
'Certainly,' said Charles, and they left.

777
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,900
CHAPTER NINE
Union Street

778
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,900
Anne could not feel angry with Charles or
Mrs Musgrove - they were both so kind - but

779
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:49,349
she felt frustrated. She wanted to be alone.
She wanted, above all, to find Captain Wentworth

780
01:11:49,349 --> 01:11:52,519
and talk to him. When they were walking up
Union Street, Captain Wentworth saw them and

781
01:11:52,519 --> 01:11:58,310
crossed the street to walk with them. He looked
at Anne nervously. She blushed and looked

782
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:03,270
at him with an expression she hoped would
show her true feelings.

783
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:08,650
'Ah! Captain Wentworth!' said Charles. 'Are
you going towards Anne's house? She's not

784
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:15,780
feeling well and must go home. I have an appointment
in five minutes, could you please walk her

785
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,780
home?'

786
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:21,550
'Of course,' said Captain Wentworth. Charles
said goodbye and left them. Anne and Frederick

787
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:25,940
walked on together slowly. They were surrounded
by people on the busy street, but they did

788
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:29,079
not notice them. Soon they had expressed again
all those feelings of love which, eight and

789
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:36,290
a half years earlier, had made their future
seem so secure. Now they were older, wiser

790
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:40,260
and stronger than they had been then, and
their love was based on a fuller knowledge

791
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,679
of each other's character.

792
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:47,309
'I never loved Louisa Musgrove,' he said.
'I tried to like her, and was thinking of

793
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:55,070
marrying her, because I wanted to marry. I
wanted to have children and a home, and I

794
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,730
was too angry and proud to ask you again.
I had thought for years that you were too

795
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:00,300
weak - too easily persuaded by other people.
But in Lyme I saw the dangers of the opposite

796
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,719
- a character that would not be persuaded
at all. I began to realise your true excellence

797
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,797
when Louisa had her accident. You were so
strong, so capable, so fine! I realised then

798
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:04,797
that your character is the perfect balance
of strength and gentleness. But, by that point,

799
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,797
people thought that Louisa and I would get
married. Perhaps even she thought so. I felt

800
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:06,797
that the only honourable thing to do would
be to marry her, if she wanted me. In the

801
01:13:06,797 --> 01:13:08,599
hope that she would forget me, I went to stay
with my brother in Shropshire, feeling lost

802
01:13:08,599 --> 01:13:13,300
and depressed. Then Harville wrote to me and
told me that Louisa was engaged to Benwick!

803
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,840
I came immediately to Bath to find you, but
then I saw you with Mr Elliot. Everyone in

804
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,010
Bath was sure that you would marry him, and
I was afraid that Lady Russell would persuade

805
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,010
you to do so.'

806
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:23,989
They had reached her house. They said goodbye,
and Anne ran up to her room, feeling happier

807
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:25,649
than she had ever felt before.

808
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:26,649
***

809
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:30,640
The evening came and the guests arrived. Anne's
happiness made her cheeks pink and her eyes

810
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,430
bright. She looked lovely as she moved through
the rooms, talking to the guests. Lady Dalrymple

811
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,409
and Mr Elliot were there, but she did not
care - no one could affect her happiness.

812
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:44,060
She did not mind the snobbish, irritating
things her father and Elizabeth said. She

813
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:50,650
did not mind Mrs Clay standing by her father's
side. She talked to Mrs Musgrove and the Crofts

814
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,650
and Captain Harville. She tried to talk to
Lady Russell but found it impossible. Sometimes

815
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,650
Captain Wentworth came and talked to her.
Sometimes she saw him across the room talking

816
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,650
to someone else but looking at her. At one
point, they stood side by side, pretending

817
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:54,650
to admire the plants.

818
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:55,650
'I've been thinking about the past,' said
Anne, 'and trying to decide if I was right

819
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,650
or wrong to follow my friend's advice. I think
I was right. I don't mean that I think her

820
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:57,650
advice was good: she was too prudent, and
I would never give such advice to a young

821
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:58,650
person now. But I think I was right to do
as she advised. She said that, if we married,

822
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,650
we would be poor and we would both be miserable.
If I had married you then, I would have felt

823
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:01,391
guilty - I would have felt that I was the
cause of any financial worries you might have

824
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:02,391
in the years ahead. Now I have nothing to
feel guilty about. I hope one day you will

825
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:03,391
be able to forgive Lady Russell and to like
her more than you do now.'

826
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,250
Captain Wentworth looked across the room at
Lady Russell. 'Maybe, one day,' he said. 'I

827
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,880
too have been thinking, and I've decided that
one person was more my enemy than Lady Russell

828
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,079
- and that person was myself. Tell me, if
I had come to you two years later, in 1808,

829
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,050
with a few thousand pounds, would you have
married me then?'

830
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,050
'Oh, yes!'

831
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,630
'Good God!' he cried. 'I was such a fool!
I wanted to do it, but I was too proud to

832
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,460
ask you again. I didn't understand you. I
shut my eyes and refused to understand you.

833
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,949
I ought to forgive everyone before I forgive
myself. This realisation is a new pain for

834
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:28,039
me. I've always thought of myself as a man
who works hard and gets what he deserves.

835
01:14:28,039 --> 01:14:30,020
Now I'll have to get used to being happier
than I deserve to be.'

836
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,020
***

837
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,239
Who can be in doubt about what followed? If
two young people decide to marry, they'll

838
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:36,239
probably do so, even if they have no money,
have no common sense, and are completely incompatible.

839
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,429
This may be a bad moral with which to end
my story, but I believe it to be true. And,

840
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:38,692
if couples like that succeed, can you doubt
that Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot - with

841
01:14:38,692 --> 01:14:39,692
the advantages of maturity, intelligence,
and twenty-five thousand pounds - succeeded

842
01:14:39,692 --> 01:14:40,692
too? Sir Walter and Elizabeth were not enthusiastic,
but they did not oppose the marriage. Now

843
01:14:40,692 --> 01:14:41,692
that Captain Wentworth was at the top of his
profession and had earned a fine fortune in

844
01:14:41,692 --> 01:14:42,692
the war, Sir Walter could not say that he
was nobody. He was now good enough to marry

845
01:14:42,692 --> 01:14:43,692
the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet.

846
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:44,692
Anne's only real worry was for Lady Russell.
She had told her friend everything that Mrs

847
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:45,692
Smith had told her about Mr Elliot's true
character. Anne knew that Lady Russell must

848
01:14:45,692 --> 01:14:46,692
be suffering from the knowledge that she had
been wrong about both Mr Elliot and Captain

849
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:47,692
Wentworth. She had mistaken manners for character
in both cases. Anne, though so much younger

850
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,692
than Lady Russell, was a much better judge
of character. But Lady Russell was a good

851
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:49,692
woman, and her greatest concern was Anne's
happiness. Very soon she began to feel affection

852
01:14:49,692 --> 01:14:50,692
for the man who had made Anne happy.

853
01:14:50,692 --> 01:14:51,692
Mary was very pleased about the marriage.
Captain Wentworth was much richer and better

854
01:14:51,692 --> 01:14:52,692
looking than either Charles Hayter or Captain
Benwick, so she felt that her own sister had

855
01:14:52,692 --> 01:14:53,692
done better than her husband's sisters, and
this gave her great pleasure.

856
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:54,692
Soon after Anne and Frederick announced their
engagement, Mr Elliot left Bath. Elizabeth

857
01:14:54,692 --> 01:14:55,692
had always believed that he was there for
her, so she felt humiliated by his departure.

858
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:56,692
Mr Elliot was shocked and upset by the news
of Anne's engagement. He had hoped to marry

859
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:57,692
her, so that he could watch Sir Walter more
closely and make sure he did not marry again.

860
01:14:57,692 --> 01:14:58,692
But, since that plan had not worked, he made
a new plan for his own comfort and pleasure.

861
01:14:58,692 --> 01:14:59,692
He left Bath and Mrs Clay left soon afterwards.
She moved into a house in London and Mr Elliot

862
01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:00,692
paid the rent. He was often seen at her house,
and people said that, though he had stopped

863
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:01,692
Mrs Clay from becoming the wife of Sir Walter,
she might one day convince him to make her

864
01:15:01,692 --> 01:15:02,692
the wife of Sir William.

865
01:15:02,692 --> 01:15:03,692
When Frederick heard Mrs Smith's story and
how she had helped Anne to understand what

866
01:15:03,692 --> 01:15:04,692
kind of man Mr Elliot really was, he felt
very friendly and grateful towards her. He

867
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:05,692
became as good a friend to her as Anne was.
She was their first guest when they were settled

868
01:15:05,692 --> 01:15:06,692
in their new home. Frederick wrote letters
to the West Indies and worked hard to help

869
01:15:06,692 --> 01:15:07,692
Mrs Smith to get her West Indian property
back, so that Mrs Smith finally had enough

870
01:15:07,692 --> 01:15:08,692
money to live a quiet, contented life.

871
01:15:08,692 --> 01:15:09,692
Anne and Frederick were very happy together.
Anne's only worry was that a future war might

872
01:15:09,692 --> 01:15:10,692
take him away from her, but she was very proud
to be a sailor's wife: she felt that the men

873
01:15:10,692 --> 01:15:11,692
of the Navy were the finest men in England.

874
01:15:11,692 --> 01:15:11,694
- THE END -
