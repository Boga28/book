CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,420
A Short History

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:13,190
Back in England's oldest times, people lived
in big groups called tribes.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,030
They were farmers - they grew their food,
and kept animals for meat and eggs.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:26,560
They lived in villages, in wooden or mud houses,
and there was often fighting between the different

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,730
tribes.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,980
Life was simple but dangerous.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,160
Then in AD 43, forty thousand Roman soldiers
invaded England from the area of Europe that

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,150
is now Italy.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,730
The Roman army was very well-organized and
had good weapons.

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,200
The soldiers built a wall around themselves
every night so they were safe.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,420
They moved across the country, fighting and
winning battles against the different tribes,

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,200
and after four years they controlled the south
of England.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,039
The Romans had to fight for many years before
they controlled all of England.

15
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:20,139
They made many changes in the country, such
as building towns and cities, and good roads.

16
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:26,229
They brought a new language to England - Latin
- and made laws, so people knew what they

17
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,560
could and could not do.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,150
The religion of Christianity came to England
in Roman times too.

19
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,119
The Romans never took control of Scotland,
which is north of England, and Scottish tribes

20
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,149
came to fight against them in the north of
England again and again.

21
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,439
Because of this, in the second century AD,
the Romans built a wall to stop the Scottish

22
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,959
tribes coming to England.

23
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,710
This wall between England and Scotland was
one hundred and twenty kilometers long, and

24
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,159
was called Hadrian's Wall.

25
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,340
For English people in towns and cities, life
in Roman times was good.

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,849
Towns now had clean water and sewers (pipes
taking away dirty water), and there were strong

27
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,849
walls around them, so people felt safe.

28
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:29,329
People came to the towns to buy and sell things,
and food became more interesting and enjoyable.

29
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:35,260
To relax, people could go to special bath
houses, where they met their friends, kept

30
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,189
clean and exercised.

31
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:43,720
But after AD 250, Roman soldiers began to
leave England.

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,579
They had to fight in other parts of the world,
and it was too expensive and difficult for

33
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,140
them to keep England safe.

34
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,230
By AD 411, all the Roman soldiers had left
England.

35
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:06,629
Then the Anglo-Saxons, from Germany, the Netherlands
and Denmark, began to arrive.

36
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:12,519
The Anglo-Saxons had come to England several
times before, but the Romans had always defeated

37
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,659
them.

38
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:20,420
Now, with the Romans gone, the English could
not win battles against the Anglo-Saxons,

39
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,459
and many Anglo-Saxons came to live in England.

40
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,459
The Anglo-Saxons did not like the Romans'
towns, so they did not use them, and the towns

41
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,920
stayed empty.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,200
The AngloSaxons built their own villages near
rivers or the sea and made wooden houses.

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,330
In their villages, they grew crops - plants
they could use for food.

44
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,640
They also kept pigs, sheep and cows, and caught
fish and other animals.

45
00:03:51,640 --> 00:04:00,670
By AD 600 in England, the AngloSaxons had
made seven kingdoms - different parts of the

46
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,900
country, each controlled by its own king.

47
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:12,680
The four main kingdoms were Northumbria, Mercia,
East Anglia and Wessex.

48
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,780
The three minor kingdoms were Essex, Kent
and Sussex.

49
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:26,610
In each of these kingdoms, the king had nobles
- important men who fought for him.

50
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,150
The other people in the kingdom were either
peasants or slaves.

51
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,470
Peasants were poor people who had some land,
but had to give money to the nobles.

52
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:44,050
Slaves had nothing and had to work for other
people for no money at all.

53
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,610
People bought and sold slaves like animals.

54
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,610
The Anglo-Saxons stayed in England, but in
AD 793 a new group of people invaded the country.

55
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,670
The Vikings, from Norway, Sweden and Denmark,
wanted good farming land.

56
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,610
They came to England in strong wooden ships,
and soon they took control of many parts of

57
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,510
the country.

58
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,990
But the Anglo-Saxon king of Wessex, Alfred
the Great, won a big battle against the Vikings.

59
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,170
After this, part of England, called Danelaw,
was given to the Vikings, but the Vikings

60
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,810
had to promise not to invade other parts of
the country.

61
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,930
After Alfred the Great died, the Viking and
Anglo-Saxon parts of England came together,

62
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,980
and England was now ruled as one country with
one king.

63
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,330
The Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons continued
to fight a lot, and for a while England had

64
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:57,110
Viking kings, but by 1042, the Anglo-Saxon
King Edward ruled England.

65
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,860
With Edward as the king, London became the
most important city in England.

66
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,210
Edward had many nobles, and he let them become
very powerful.

67
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,240
He had no children, so when he died, one of
his nobles, Harold, became the king.

68
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,920
But Edward's cousin William, a Norman (from
the north of France), believed that he should

69
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,910
be the king of England.

70
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,900
In October 1066, William brought a big Norman
army from France to England.

71
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,030
The Normans fought against Harold and his
soldiers at the Battle of Hastings.

72
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,670
Harold was killed, and William the Conqueror,
as he was called, became the king of England.

73
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,100
William the Conqueror made many important
changes in England.

74
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,800
A lot of castles were built.

75
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,610
One of these was the Tower of London, which
you can visit today.

76
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,140
William the Conqueror brought the feudal system
to England.

77
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,280
In the feudal system, the richest and most
important person was the king.

78
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,490
Below the king were the nobles, then the knights
and then the serfs, who were the poorest people

79
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,970
in the land.

80
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,680
The king owned everything in the country,
but he gave a castle and land to his nobles,

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,900
and they paid him money.

82
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:33,900
The nobles gave land to the knights, who had
to fight battles for the nobles and the king.

83
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,840
The knights gave some land to the serfs, who
had to work for the knights and give them

84
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,180
food from the land.

85
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,150
William the Conqueror wanted to know exactly
what he had in England.

86
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,810
He sent people all around the country, asking
many questions, and they made a big book called

87
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,500
the Domesday Book.

88
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:03,240
The book showed how much farming land there
was in England and how many animals.

89
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,000
We know a lot about life in Norman England
because of the Domesday Book.

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,710
The time from William the Conqueror's rule
until the fifteenth century in England is

91
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,890
often called the Middle Ages.

92
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,590
In the Middle Ages, most people lived in villages.

93
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:27,950
The people of the village had to work for
the nobles, and give them crops and animals.

94
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,531
The nobles lived very well, in big houses
and with expensive food, but most people were

95
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,090
very poor.

96
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,190
Religion was very important in the Middle
Ages, and the Catholic Church became very

97
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,270
powerful.

98
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:53,500
From 1095 to 1291, soldiers went to other
countries to fight religious battles.

99
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,570
There was more fighting in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, as France and England

100
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:05,690
fought the Hundred Years War, hoping to win
land from each other.

101
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,560
Many of the battles of the Hundred Years War
were fought by knights.

102
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,330
As well as fighting battles for nobles and
for the king, knights also fought as a sport

103
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,810
in competitions called jousting tournaments.

104
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,740
Young men who wanted to become knights had
to spend many years learning all the things

105
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,630
that a knight could do.

106
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:35,700
In 1348, a terrible illness called The Black
Death came to England.

107
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,130
Only about four million people lived in England
at that time, but in two years, nearly one-and-a-half

108
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,680
million of them died.

109
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,480
From 1455-1485, there were terrible battles
between people who wanted the kings of the

110
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,080
country to be from different families, and
many more people died.

111
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:10,340
Finally, in 1485, Henry Tudor became the first
Tudor king of England, King Henry the Seventh.

112
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,640
Some of the Tudor kings and queens are now
very famous in England's history.

113
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,240
Henry the Eighth, who became the king in 1509,
lived some of the time at the Tower of London,

114
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,860
but he had other beautiful palaces in and
around London, including the Palace of Westminster

115
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,420
and Hampton Court.

116
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,640
He and the people around him lived very well.

117
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,930
They wore the best clothes and ate wonderful
food, and at the palaces there was always

118
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,510
dancing, sport, poetry and music.

119
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,610
Henry enjoyed life, and he drank and ate too
much.

120
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,420
When he became the king, he was a sporty,
good-looking young man, but later he became

121
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,710
so fat he could not walk!

122
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,000
England was a Catholic country, but Henry
the Eighth wanted England to leave the Catholic

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,170
Church, so he started a new church.

124
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,350
It was a Protestant church (a Christian church,
but for people who believe in a different

125
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,990
kind of Christianity) called the Church of
England, and he controlled it.

126
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,120
Anyone who disagreed with the new church was
executed - killed for their crime.

127
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,220
When Henry the Eighth was ruling England,
more than seventy thousand people were killed

128
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,890
because of crimes, or because they disagreed
with the king about religion or other important

129
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,300
things.

130
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,810
Six years after Henry the Eighth died, his
oldest daughter Mary - the daughter he had

131
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,990
with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon - became
Queen Mary the First of England.

132
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,030
She was a Catholic and wanted England to be
a Catholic country again, but many people

133
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,510
had left the Catholic Church and had become
Protestants.

134
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:11,790
Mary executed hundreds of Protestants who
refused to become Catholic again.

135
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,610
But in 1558, Mary died, and her half-sister
Elizabeth - the daughter Henry had with his

136
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,610
second wife Anne Boleyn - became the queen.

137
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,800
Queen Elizabeth the First was a Protestant,
but she did not make Catholics follow her

138
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,930
religion, and she soon became one of the best
loved of England's kings and queens.

139
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,040
The second half of the sixteenth century,
which was known as the Elizabethan period,

140
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,250
was a very important time for English literature.

141
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,589
Many people liked to go to the theatre, and
William Shakespeare wrote a lot of plays and

142
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,840
poetry at this time.

143
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,550
Ships also began to travel to other parts
of the world.

144
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,080
Sir Walter Raleigh sailed to America, and
Sir Francis Drake became the first Englishman

145
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,860
to sail around the world.

146
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,660
But life in England was also very difficult
for many people in the Elizabethan period.

147
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,290
There was less work in farming now, and a
lot of people were very poor.

148
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,030
There was a lot of crime, but no police, and
when people were caught for crimes, they were

149
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,910
often executed.

150
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:32,550
Alter Queen Elizabeth the First died in 1603,
kings and queens called the Stuarts came to

151
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,990
power in England.

152
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,970
The Stuarts were from Scotland, and for the
first time, they ruled both England and Scotland.

153
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,410
The second of the Stuart kings was Charles
the First.

154
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,170
He argued with Parliament because he spent
a lot of money fighting wars in Europe, and

155
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,130
in 1642, he started a civil war.

156
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:05,300
For seven years, the King's men and Parliaments
men fought against each other, and thousands

157
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,529
died.

158
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:13,830
But with Oliver Cromwell as leader, Parliaments
army became very strong and fought very well,

159
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,250
and in 1649, they won the war.

160
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:25,500
Charles the First was executed, and for eleven
years England had no king or queen.

161
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,980
The country was ruled by Cromwell and Parliament.

162
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,610
Cromwell was a Puritan - a Protestant who
believed in a simple, hard-working life - and

163
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:44,650
when he ruled, there was no sport or dancing
in England, and theatres were closed.

164
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,460
When Cromwell died, England was ready to have
a king again, and the Stuarts came to power

165
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,890
once more.

166
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,529
There were some difficult times for England
in the second half of the seventeenth century.

167
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:05,020
In 1665, another terrible illness came to
London and killed nearly seventy thousand

168
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:12,740
people, and a year later, large parts of London
were burnt down in the Great Fire of London.

169
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,990
There were many other changes at this time
too.

170
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:23,420
England now traded - bought and sold things
- with many other countries, so English people

171
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:31,250
could get different foods like tomatoes, chocolate,
coffee and tea for the first time.

172
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,430
People continued to work on the land, but
now there were other jobs, in cloth-making

173
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:42,230
or glass-making, and in the coal or iron industries.

174
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,370
London was rebuilt with wider roads and many
beautiful new buildings, and scientists like

175
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,240
Sir Isaac Newton began to do important work
and learn many interesting things.

176
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,850
England started its first colonies too.

177
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:04,430
These were other parts of the world, like
America, which were ruled by England.

178
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,589
For the first time in the seventeenth century,
people from England went to live and work

179
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,190
in these places.

180
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:17,600
There was one more important change as England
entered the eighteenth century.

181
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,390
In 1707, the Act of Union brought England,
Wales and Scotland together with one parliament

182
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,730
as Great Britain.

183
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,270
The eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
were called the Georgian period because Britain's

184
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,510
kings were George the First, Second, Third
and Fourth.

185
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:43,170
But during this time, kings became much less
powerful, and Parliament really began to rule

186
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,589
the country.

187
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:51,089
An industrial revolution began in Britain
too: machines were built, and they were used

188
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:54,050
in many different industries.

189
00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,700
People could now make many things very quickly,
and because of this towns began to grow.

190
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:07,620
In 1783, Britain lost the American War of
Independence, so America was no longer ruled

191
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,579
by Britain and became independent.

192
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,350
Britain did not have its old American colonies
anymore, but it now found new ones.

193
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,119
In that same year, France gave its colonies
in Canada to Britain, and by the end of the

194
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,929
eighteenth century, Britain had won many battles
in India, which soon became an important part

195
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,489
of the British Empire.

196
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:39,110
This was a great time for exploration: travelling
to different places to find new things.

197
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,919
The famous sailor Captain Cook visited many
new lands and was the first European to go

198
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,600
to Australia and New Zealand.

199
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,710
In 1801, Ireland and Britain came together
as the United Kingdom (UK) with one parliament.

200
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,830
(Today, Northern Ireland is the only part
of Ireland which belongs to the UK.)

201
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:11,720
The ruler of this new UK, from 1837 until
1901, was Queen Victoria.

202
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,110
Victoria ruled for longer than any other English
or British king or queen, and she was much

203
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,990
loved by many of her people.

204
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,470
In the Victorian period, the British

205
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,519
Empire became bigger and more important, and
the industrial revolution continued.

206
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:36,610
The country was growing, but at first this
made life difficult for many people.

207
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,929
More and more factories were built in the
UK, and factory work was very hard and very

208
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,629
dangerous.

209
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:49,110
Towns got bigger and bigger, but people put
their rubbish and dirty water in the streets,

210
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,149
so there was a lot of illness.

211
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,679
But soon important new changes started to
happen.

212
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:05,940
Towns became cleaner, and in 1880, all children
aged 5-10 began to go to school.

213
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,590
People had electric lights and telephones
for the first time, and because the railways

214
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,320
grew, they could now travel around the country
easily.

215
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:42,799
By 1901, when Queen Victoria died, the modern
United Kingdom was arriving.

216
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,679
CHAPTER TWO

217
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,720
England in the Modern UK

218
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,170
In the early 1900s, the UK was one of the
most powerful countries in the world, with

219
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,230
a big empire.

220
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,940
The industrial revolution was changing many
peoples lives, and steamships and cars were

221
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,359
widely used for the first time.

222
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:11,159
Rich people lived very well, with beautiful
houses and servants, but poor people had few

223
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,770
clothes and little to eat, and their children
were often ill.

224
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:21,230
Life was difficult for women in the UK at
this time too.

225
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,259
People expected women to stay at home with
their families, and they could not get well-paid

226
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,659
jobs.

227
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:33,919
It was very difficult for women to go to university,
and they could not vote.

228
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:41,390
In 1903, a group of women called the suffragettes,
led by Emmeline Pankhurst, organized meetings

229
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,799
and marches, asking for Parliament to give
women the vote.

230
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:54,020
In 1914, the UK and its allies, France and
Russia, went to war with Germany and Austria-Hungary.

231
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,500
Many young men chose to fight.

232
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,539
They believed the war would be very short,
but it went on for four years, and nearly

233
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:09,669
three quarters of a million soldiers from
the UK were killed.

234
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:15,480
While the men were fighting, women had to
do the men's jobs at home.

235
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,080
Women soon showed that they could work in
farming, factories and even in the coal industry.

236
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,730
After helping their country to win the First
World War, workers and women in England wanted

237
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,190
better lives.

238
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:37,039
Men got their jobs at home back from the women,
so most women were no longer working, but

239
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,720
in 1918, women over thirty were given the
vote for the first time.

240
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,929
From 1929, women, like men, could vote from
the age of twenty-one.

241
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,960
A new political party for working people - the
Labour Party - became important in politics

242
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,110
at this time, and in 1926, half a million
workers went on strike to fight against low

243
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,049
pay and long working hours.

244
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:13,250
But life became even more difficult for workers
in 1929, when the world went into an economic

245
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,220
depression.

246
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,789
Prices fell, there was less trade, and many
shops and factories closed.

247
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:28,750
By 1931, nearly three million people in the
UK had lost their jobs.

248
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,960
The First World War was fought mainly in battles
on fields in France, but almost everyone in

249
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,869
the UK had a difficult life because of the
Second World War (1939-45).

250
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:47,960
Many children had to leave their homes and
go to live in the countryside.

251
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,259
This was because at the end of 1940 and the
beginning of 1941, the Germans dropped many

252
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,860
bombs on London and other cities.

253
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,720
This was called the Blitz.

254
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,399
Many people lost their homes and their families,
and everyone had to live on rations - they

255
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,429
could only buy fixed amounts of many kinds
of food.

256
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,513
'When we heard the air raid warning in the
middle of the night, everyone woke up and

257
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:12,513
got into the shelters.

258
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:18,700
The Second World War ended in 1945, and big
changes were made by a new Labour government.

259
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,889
Most importantly, the UK now had a National
Health Service, so anyone who was ill could

260
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:28,169
see a doctor or go to hospital without paying.

261
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:34,230
The government also now gave money to help
people who were ill or old, or had lost their

262
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,370
jobs.

263
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:42,460
Because of the Education Act of 1944, there
were also free places in schools for children

264
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,779
up to the age of fifteen.

265
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,020
Another change after the Second World War
was that more women went to work.

266
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:57,239
They had shown that they could do men's jobs,
and many of them had done important war work.

267
00:23:57,239 --> 00:24:03,330
In some homes, nothing was different for women,
but over the next fifty years, women in the

268
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,919
UK slowly saw changes for themselves in education,
work and at home.

269
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,640
Their lives would never be the same again.

270
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,690
After the Second World War, many of the UK's
colonies wanted to rule themselves.

271
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,440
The south of Ireland had already become independent
from the UK in 1921, so the country had now

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,669
become the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.

273
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:36,100
People from the colonies had fought for the
UK during the war, and they felt they had

274
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,820
won their freedom.

275
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:46,509
In 1947, India, once a very important part
of the Empire, became independent.

276
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:51,890
In the next twenty years, most of the other
colonies also did the same.

277
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:58,110
They became independent, but joined the Commonwealth,
an organization of the governments of the

278
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,139
UK's old colonies.

279
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:07,350
The UK needed more workers to help rebuild
the country after the war, so the government

280
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:14,389
invited other Europeans and people from the
colonies of the old Empire to move there.

281
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:21,190
Hoping to find good new jobs, many people
came, mainly from Europe, India, Pakistan

282
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,549
and the West Indies.

283
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:32,549
In 1945, there were only a few thousand non-white
people in the UK, but by 1970, there were

284
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:34,100
1.4 million.

285
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,509
Sadly, there were often problems in later
years when some of the people born in the

286
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:45,210
UK felt that immigrants and their families
were taking too many jobs.

287
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,169
There is some racism - when people do not
like others because they have a different

288
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:51,779
colour skin - in the UK today.

289
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:59,559
But most people do not like racism and want
all people in the UK to live together happily.

290
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:06,600
In 1952, Elizabeth the Second became the new
queen of the UK, and millions of people watched

291
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,809
her coronation on TV.

292
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:15,679
The first TVs were made in the 1920s, but
many English people bought TVs for the first

293
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,820
time for the coronation, and in the 1950s,
TV started to become an important part of

294
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,179
life in England.

295
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,039
There were many changes in the UK in the second
half of the twentieth century.

296
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:37,139
Many of the country's traditional industries,
for example iron, cloth, coal and shipbuilding,

297
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:43,600
began to have problems, and people working
in those industries lost their jobs.

298
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,779
New industries became more important, for
example banking and pharmaceuticals (drugs

299
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,869
and medicines).

300
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:57,070
England today is a very different place than
it was one hundred years ago.

301
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:03,059
Today, England is one of the most multicultural
countries in the world, and many people from

302
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:11,509
the West Indies, Africa, India, China, South-East
Asia and eastern Europe live here.

303
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:17,119
More than two hundred and fifty different
languages are spoken in London!

304
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,729
Probably because of this, there are also many
religions in England.

305
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:28,129
England is a Christian country, but different
religions are freely followed, and there are

306
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:33,710
many Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist
people here.

307
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,970
Society has changed in England too.

308
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,020
One hundred years ago, most people married
in their early twenties or younger and then

309
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,809
had children, but today many more people live
alone, and most do not get married or have

310
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,710
children until they are in their thirties
or older.

311
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,259
England's place in the world, as part of the
UK, is also very different.

312
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:06,269
The UK does not have an empire now, but it
is an important country in Europe and became

313
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:13,789
a member of the European Union (then called
the EEC) in 1973.

314
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:20,590
The UK works very closely with the United
States of America (USA), and it also continues

315
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,639
to be a member of the Commonwealth, together
with fifty-two other countries from around

316
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,519
the world.

317
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:54,169
Members of the Commonwealth meet every two
years to decide how they can best work together.

318
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,840
CHAPTER THREE

319
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Traditions

320
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,849
Because England is such an old country, it
has many traditions.

321
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:08,840
Some of these have come from important or
interesting moments in history.

322
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,190
Some have come from other parts of the world.

323
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,929
Others have come from England's many kings
or queens, or from its long religious history.

324
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:24,480
There are special days and festivals throughout
the year in England, but only a few are bank

325
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,700
holidays - days when people do not have to
work.

326
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,029
Christmas is one of the most important religious
festivals in England.

327
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:42,629
Christmas Day, 25th December, and the next
day, Boxing Day, are always bank holidays,

328
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:46,769
and most people spend this time with family
or friends.

329
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:54,039
Traditionally, people eat turkey on Christmas
Day, with Brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce;

330
00:29:54,039 --> 00:30:00,720
and for dessert there is usually Christmas
pudding, a type of cake made with dried fruit.

331
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,580
Not long before Christmas, people decorate42
their houses and send cards to people they

332
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,860
know.

333
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,299
On Christmas Day, there are presents from
friends and family, and, for the children,

334
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,269
from Father Christmas (or Santa Claus).

335
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:22,379
Children believe that Father Christmas brings
the presents on 24th December, Christmas Eve,

336
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:25,789
and leaves them to be opened on the morning
of Christmas Day.

337
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:30,090
New Year's Eve is also important in England.

338
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,419
Many people go to the Houses of Parliament
in London to hear Big Ben (the bell inside

339
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:41,029
the big clock tower) strike midnight and to
see the wonderful fireworks near the River

340
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:42,830
Thames.

341
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,789
Other people meet up with friends and family,
and make New Year's Resolutions: they decide

342
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:53,639
what things they will do (or not do!) in the
next year.

343
00:30:53,639 --> 00:31:00,159
On Valentine's Day, 14th February, people
give cards or presents to the people they

344
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:07,659
love, but April Fool's Day, on 1st April,
is a very different kind of celebration.

345
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:15,039
On that day, people play jokes on their friends
and family, and call them an 'April Fool!'.

346
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,580
People think April Fool's Day started because,
before 1562, 1st April was the first day of

347
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,480
the year.

348
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,059
In 1562, this was changed, so 1st January
became the first day of the year.

349
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:36,349
But many people were slow to remember the
change, so they were laughed at for celebrating

350
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:39,210
New Year's Day on 1st April.

351
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,450
There is often special food for festivals
in England.

352
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:50,149
Shrove Tuesday, in February, comes the day
before the start of Lent, the forty days before

353
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,009
Easter.

354
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:58,190
In the past, people stopped eating the most
important foods - butter, eggs and flour - during

355
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,629
Lent.

356
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:06,960
So on Shrove Tuesday, they made pancakes with
these foods, and ate butter, eggs and flour

357
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,289
for the last time.

358
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:16,399
People continue to eat pancakes today, and
there are many pancake races around the country:

359
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,539
people have to run, throwing pancakes up and
down in a frying pan!

360
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:29,809
Today, many people try to give something up
for Lent too - often sweets, cakes or chocolate!

361
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:35,600
After Lent comes Easter, another religious
festival, and for people who go to church,

362
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,289
a very important time of year.

363
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:44,529
Easter comes in the spring, and many people
give each other Easter eggs and Easter bunnies

364
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,080
(little rabbits) made from chocolate.

365
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,629
For children, there are often Easter Egg Hunts,
when little eggs are hidden in the house or

366
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:55,509
garden.

367
00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:01,860
People also eat hot cross buns at Easter - warm
sweet bread with dried fruit inside and a

368
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,679
cross on top.

369
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,229
May Day in England is on the first day of
May, and there is a bank holiday on or very

370
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,679
near that day.

371
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,690
This is usually the start of warmer weather
in England, and sometimes people celebrate

372
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,940
with Maypole dancing - dancing around a big
pole with ribbons.

373
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:30,269
Halloween, on 31st October, has become a popular
festival in modern times.

374
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:36,571
On this night, children dress up as witches,
ghosts and other frightening things, and go

375
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:39,820
from house to house, calling 'Trick or Treat'.

376
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:46,090
The neighbours give them sweets and other
nice things, but if they have nothing to give,

377
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,109
the children play a trick, or joke, on them.

378
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:54,519
A strange festival is held on 5th November.

379
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:01,809
On that day in 1605, a man called Guy Fawkes
and a group of friends tried to blow up the

380
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,519
Houses of Parliament.

381
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,200
They wanted to do this because King James
and his nobles were not treating the Catholics

382
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,770
in the country well.

383
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,000
But the king's soldiers found Guy Fawkes in
the Houses of Parliament and stopped him and

384
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,619
his friends.

385
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:23,799
Now on 5th November every year, there are
bonfires and fireworks all over England on

386
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:27,210
'Guy Fawkes Night'.

387
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:34,220
Another day that is important because of something
in history is Remembrance Day, on 11th November.

388
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,839
At eleven o'clock in the morning on that day,
at exactly the time when the First World War

389
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,069
ended in 1918, many people are silent for
two minutes.

390
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:51,059
They remember the many men and women who have
lost their lives in wars.

391
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:57,109
Many people wear paper poppies - red flowers
- on their coats at this time too.

392
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:02,130
Poppies grew on the battlefields of France
after the First World War ended, so they make

393
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,619
people remember the terrible days of the war.

394
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:11,190
Because kings and queens have always been
so important in England's history, there are

395
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,250
many royal traditions.

396
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,760
One important tradition is the State Opening
of Parliament.

397
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,490
On this day, the Queen goes from her home
at Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament

398
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,549
in a gold carriage and then reads 'the Queen's
speech'.

399
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:34,950
This tells people what the government wants
to do in the next year.

400
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:40,599
Another important yearly royal tradition is
called 'Trooping the Colour'.

401
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,690
To celebrate the Queen's birthday, more than
a thousand soldiers and musicians march from

402
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:53,240
Buckingham Palace to Whitehall and back again,
and the Queen goes past them in her carriage.

403
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,020
On most days at Buckingham Palace, you can
also see the 'Changing of the Guard'.

404
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,150
This is when one group of soldiers who were
guarding the Queen leave the palace, and another

405
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,490
group arrives.

406
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:14,170
The soldiers who guard the Queen wear red
coats and tall hats, made from real bearskin.

407
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,380
They can march in front of the palace, but
when they are standing, they must not move.

408
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,329
There are many important traditions in sport
in England.

409
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:28,740
One famous example is the Oxford and Cambridge
boat race.

410
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:35,490
Oxford and Cambridge are the two oldest universities
in England, and because both universities

411
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,619
are in cities with rivers, Oxford and Cambridge
students have always enjoyed rowing.

412
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:48,069
In rowing, two, four or eight people move
a boat through water with long wooden sticks

413
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,400
called oars.

414
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,299
They sit with their backs towards the front
of the boat, so there is often a person called

415
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:59,880
a cox at the back, telling them where to go.

416
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,319
In 1829, students from Oxford and Cambridge
decided to have a rowing race, and since then

417
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,130
there has been a race on the Thames every
year in spring.

418
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,099
The Oxford and Cambridge boat race: Oxford
in dark blue, Cambridge in light blue

419
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:15,789
What is traditional English food and drink?

420
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:19,970
Fish and chips are probably England's most
famous dish.

421
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:26,029
Fish and chips first became popular in the
1860s, when the railways opened and trains

422
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:31,520
began to bring fish from the east coast of
England to the cities.

423
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,849
Fish and chips are usually eaten as takeaway
food (food that is not eaten in a cafe or

424
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:44,839
restaurant), with the fish wrapped in paper,
and the chips covered in salt and vinegar.

425
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:52,079
Today, Indian and Chinese takeaways are just
as popular as fish and chips.

426
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,500
England is also famous for its breakfasts.

427
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,799
Very few people eat a full English breakfast
every day, but you can usually get one in

428
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,579
hotels or cafes.

429
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:11,859
The English breakfast is toast, eggs and sausages,
often with tomatoes, beans, hash browns (potato

430
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:14,810
cakes) and mushrooms too!

431
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:21,890
Bangers (sausages) and mash (a mixture of
potatoes with butter and milk) is another

432
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,670
traditional dish in England.

433
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:30,840
The sausages are often called bangers because
in times of war, when food was rationed, there

434
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,069
was usually a lot of water in the sausages.

435
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:37,829
When they were fried, they often blew up!

436
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:43,990
The traditional Sunday lunch is a roast dinner,
with roast beef, roast potatoes and Yorkshire

437
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:49,020
pudding (a cooked mixture of eggs, flour and
milk).

438
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:55,260
However, many English people now eat fewer
traditional dishes, and English people now

439
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,870
eat lots of different kinds of food from all
around the world.

440
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,410
But some traditional English food continues
to be very popular.

441
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:10,480
English farmers make wonderful cheeses like
red leicester, cheddar and Stilton, and at

442
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:18,119
farmers' markets all around the country people
can buy fantastic meat, fish, fruit, vegetables

443
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,250
and bread.

444
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:26,549
Tea, of course, is one of the most important
drinks in England, and in cafes and at home

445
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:33,000
many people like to have afternoon tea, which
is tea with cakes and sandwiches.

446
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,980
English people also like to go to the pub
to have a drink and perhaps to eat.

447
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:45,079
These are places where people come together
to talk, play games, or watch football or

448
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,720
rugby matches.

449
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,710
In different areas of England there are some
very strange traditions.

450
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:58,480
At many fairs, you can see Morris dancing
(people in costumes dancing to music with

451
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,950
sticks, swords and handkerchiefs).

452
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,800
In the Lake District, people have a 'gurning'
competition every year.

453
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,329
Gurning is trying to make a very strange face,
for example by lifting the bottom of your

454
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,529
mouth up above the top of it!

455
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:21,940
And in a village near Gloucester there is
a cheese rolling competition, in which people

456
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:37,099
run after a cheese which is moving like a
wheel down a very big hill!

457
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:48,829
CHAPTER FOUR

458
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:52,960
Cities and Sights

459
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,160
England has fifty cities and many smaller
towns, and there are lots of things to see

460
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,550
and do there.

461
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,930
The biggest city, and England's capital, is
London.

462
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:11,110
Nearly eight million people live in London
- more than in any other European city.

463
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:17,079
The country's government is there, and for
people in many different jobs, London is the

464
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,369
most important place to be for work.

465
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:26,160
For visitors, too, London has many of England's
most interesting sights and is one of the

466
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,890
most important places to visit.

467
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:36,440
London has many areas, which are often very
different, even if they are very close!

468
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:42,660
Whitehall and Westminster are the areas where
you can see some of London's most famous sights.

469
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:48,700
Here, next to the River Thames, are Big Ben
and the Houses of Parliament.

470
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,661
At one time, England's kings and queens lived
in these buildings, and they were called the

471
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:58,690
Palace of Westminster, but today Parliament
meets here.

472
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:04,799
Near the Houses of Parliament is Downing Street,
where the UK's prime minister - the leader

473
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:09,260
- lives, and where the government meets.

474
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,950
Also near here is Westminster Abbey, a large
and very important church where England's

475
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:21,140
kings and queens have had their coronations
since the time of William the Conqueror.

476
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,460
Following the Thames to the north, and then
towards the east from Whitehall and Westminster,

477
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,010
you come to the West End.

478
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,710
Here you can find theatres, restaurants, cinemas
and clubs.

479
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:39,900
Covent Garden, where there was once a big
market, is now a great place to go shopping,

480
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:47,170
or to have a coffee and watch the street entertainers
- actors, musicians, dancers and others who

481
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,170
do small shows outside.

482
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:55,500
Further east is a small area called the City
of London, which was the most important part

483
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,510
of London in the Middle Ages.

484
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:04,299
It is now one of the great financial centers
of the world - a place where money comes in

485
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:09,099
and out, and where England's big banks work
from.

486
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:15,230
Also here is St Paul's Cathedral, which was
built by the great architect Sir Christopher

487
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:21,430
Wren, and the Tower of London, a castle from
the eleventh century.

488
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:26,160
London is also famous for its large and beautiful
parks.

489
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,180
Just minutes from the West End, people can
walk, exercise and relax in the large green

490
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,589
areas of Hyde Park, Green Park and St James's
Park.

491
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:45,260
Many people visit London for its museums and
art galleries, and most of these are free.

492
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:52,560
The Tate Modern is the worlds largest modern
art gallery, and at the British Museum, there

493
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,270
are several kilometers of rooms, with more
than seventy thousand things to see.

494
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:04,599
Many visitors to London like to take a ride
on the London Eye, the largest Ferris wheel

495
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,800
in Europe.

496
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,200
From the top of the Eye, at one hundred and
thirty- five meters, you can see many of London's

497
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,589
most famous buildings.

498
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:23,950
Not far from London, you can visit three interesting
and important royal places - Windsor Castle,

499
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:31,210
which continues to be used by the royal family
today, Hampton Court Palace and Kew Gardens.

500
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:37,309
It is less than 100 kilometers from London
to Oxford, one of England's most beautiful

501
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:42,359
cities and home to its oldest university.

502
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,060
Here you can walk around the fantastic old
buildings of colleges like Christ Church and

503
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,200
Magdalen, many of them more than five hundred
years old.

504
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,579
Oxford also has England's oldest museum, the
Ashmolean, as well as parks, gardens and lovely

505
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,960
river walks.

506
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,730
Oxford is near a famous area of England called
the Cotswolds.

507
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:14,000
Close to the green hills there are beautiful
villages, with pretty houses made from gold-coloured

508
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,920
stone and fine old churches.

509
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,420
Many visitors come to this area, and there
are tourist shops and afternoon tea rooms

510
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,950
in a lot of bigger villages.

511
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:33,769
Oxford is not very far from Stratford-upon-Avon,
famous as the home town of William Shakespeare,

512
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:35,630
the great writer.

513
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:42,269
In this pretty river town, you can visit Shakespeare's
old house and also see a play at the theatre

514
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:44,349
of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

515
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:52,470
At Warwick, just a few kilometers away, is
one of the greatest medieval castles in England.

516
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:59,220
With its great towers and walls, dark dungeons
and beautiful gardens, Warwick Castle is one

517
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,990
of the most impressive in England.

518
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:08,680
The University of Cambridge is almost as old
as Oxford's, and the two cities are like each

519
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,529
other in many ways.

520
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:19,380
Like Oxford, Cambridge is a city of old colleges,
many from the late thirteenth and early fourteenth

521
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,140
centuries.

522
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,380
With its gardens, green spaces and river,
Cambridge is a lovely city to walk around.

523
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:33,680
Two of the most famous places in Cambridge
are King's College, with its beautiful chapel

524
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,390
(a small church), and the Backs, an area of
green land around the River Cam from where

525
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,510
you can see many of the colleges.

526
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:50,970
Moving north, England's second biggest city
is Birmingham, which was an important center

527
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,750
during the industrial revolution.

528
00:46:53,750 --> 00:47:00,549
Today, Birmingham is a very multicultural
city and is home to the National Exhibition

529
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:06,809
Centre (NEC), where many big shows and events
are held.

530
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:13,190
Many people come to Birmingham to visit its
big, modern shopping center, the Bull Ring,

531
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,299
but few tourists spend a lot of time here.

532
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:22,390
Further north of Birmingham, Stoke-on-Trent
has been famous since the seventeenth century

533
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:30,970
for its pottery industry - the industry of
making objects such as cups, plates and bowls.

534
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:38,269
Here you can visit the pottery factories and
buy pottery cheaply from the factory shops.

535
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:42,700
York is one of the most interesting cities
of the north of England.

536
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,099
It was a Roman city, and for many years it
was an important place for religion and politics

537
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,890
in England.

538
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,509
During medieval times - the Middle Ages - there
was a strong wool trade in York, and because

539
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:01,180
of this, many other traders came to live here.

540
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:08,680
The city feels very medieval even today, with
its narrow streets and old walls.

541
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,099
Many tourists come to visit the city and to
see York Minster, the city's old cathedral

542
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:19,820
(a large and important church), with its beautiful
windows.

543
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:26,569
York was an important city when the railways
were first built in England, and now it is

544
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:30,849
home to the National Railway Museum.

545
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:36,119
Twenty-five kilometers from York is Castle
Howard, one of the best of England's stately

546
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:40,390
homes (big country houses).

547
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:45,599
Stately homes were built for the most important
families of England, who normally had homes

548
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,119
in London too.

549
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:53,299
These homes were places where the king or
queen could visit and where important people

550
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:57,279
could have meetings about politics or government.

551
00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:03,779
Two very exciting cities in the north of England
are Liverpool and Manchester.

552
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:09,829
Liverpool, which is on the sea, became important
in the eighteenth century because of trade

553
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,309
with America.

554
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:17,569
Many immigrants from the West Indies, China
and Ireland arrived in Liverpool when they

555
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:24,630
came to England, so Liverpool was one of England's
first multicultural cities.

556
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:31,920
But by the 1970s and 1980s, ships were no
longer coming to Liverpool.

557
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,680
The city's old buildings stayed empty, and
it became very poor.

558
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,319
Since 2004, a lot of money has been spent
in Liverpool, and Albert Dock, where ships

559
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:52,109
used to arrive, is now an exciting new area
with restaurants, museums, shops and art galleries.

560
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:59,390
Liverpool was home to The Beatles, and many
people come here to do 'Beatles Tours' and

561
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:05,461
to visit the clubs where the famous band played
or see the homes where John, Paul, George

562
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:08,069
and Ringo lived.

563
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:16,220
In Liverpool, you can also see some wonderful
art at the Walker Art Gallery or Tate Liverpool,

564
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:21,819
visit the two cathedrals, or take a boat across
the River Mersey and look back at the famous

565
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:25,410
sights of this great city.

566
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:32,269
Just fifty kilometers east of Liverpool is
another big city, Manchester.

567
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,910
Manchester has some of the most exciting modern
buildings in England.

568
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:42,059
Its cafes, clubs and nightlife make it one
of the best cities in the country for many

569
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:43,359
young people.

570
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:51,019
But like Liverpool, Manchester had a difficult
time in the second half of the twentieth century.

571
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:56,559
Once the most important city in the world
for cotton, Manchester's old industries were

572
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,220
coming to an end by the 1950s, and many people
lost their jobs.

573
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:09,519
But new industries began to grow, and at the
start of the twenty-first century, parts of

574
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:15,349
the city were rebuilt, making Manchester an
exciting city once more.

575
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:19,720
Blackpool is very different from Liverpool
and Manchester.

576
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:26,460
With its long beaches, hotels and piers, Blackpool
is a popular holiday town.

577
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,759
Here you can eat fish and chips, go to amusement
arcades and see the coloured lights on Blackpool

578
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,460
Tower.

579
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,700
Some of the most interesting sights of England
are in the far north of the country.

580
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:47,019
Durham Cathedral, almost nine hundred years
old, is here, and also the Angel of the North,

581
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:49,859
the biggest sculpture in England.

582
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:56,780
The sculpture - of an angel with very wide
wings - was built on an old coal mine by Antony

583
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,319
Gormley, the same artist who made Another
Place (see the fact box opposite).

584
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:06,460
He wanted people to remember that for two
hundred years, mining was one of the biggest

585
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,549
industries in this area.

586
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:15,750
People pass the Angel of the North as they
drive to Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

587
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:22,599
Like Manchester and Liverpool, Newcastle is
another industrial city that now has museums,

588
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:27,059
art galleries and an exciting nightlife.

589
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:33,630
Near Newcastle is the end of Hadrians Wall,
parts of which can be seen very clearly.

590
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:39,490
Today, the border with Scotland is further
north than it was when the Romans built Hadrians

591
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,490
Wall.

592
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:47,760
Just a few kilometers from today's border
is another interesting sight, Holy Island,

593
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,910
or Lindisfarne.

594
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,589
You cannot get to the island at high tide
- when the sea comes in closest to the land

595
00:52:54,589 --> 00:53:00,800
- but at other times you can walk or drive
across to it and see the castle that was built

596
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,930
here in the sixteenth century.

597
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:08,869
Back in the south of England, and west of
London, there are more sights and interesting

598
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:10,720
cities to see.

599
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,630
Bath, so-called because of its famous Roman
baths, is a lovely little city.

600
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:24,299
The old Roman baths are some of the best-kept
in Europe, and in the eighteenth century,

601
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:28,609
many rich and important people came here to
'take the waters'.

602
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:35,430
Big, fine houses were built for them, and
so Bath has many Georgian streets and buildings,

603
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,240
with pretty parks too.

604
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,150
Just a few kilometers further west from Bath,
but very different, is the big, busy city

605
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,859
of Bristol.

606
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:53,530
Bristol, once a very big port, now has a strong
electronics industry and is important in the

607
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,119
creative media - film, TV, radio and fashion.

608
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:04,019
It is also the biggest cultural center in
the area, with a busy nightlife.

609
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:10,730
As in many other cities in England, the old
docks - the area where the ships used to come

610
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:17,420
in - have now been changed into an area for
restaurants, shops and museums.

611
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:23,150
One of the most famous sights of Bristol is
the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which was made

612
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:28,380
by the great engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunei.

613
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,789
Many visitors to Bristol make the short journey
south to Glastonbury.

614
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:39,890
Here you can visit Glastonbury Abbey, which
was built in the seventh century.

615
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:44,930
Glastonbury is also famous for the music festival
held there most years in June.

616
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,010
It is the biggest music festival in the country.

617
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,410
Stonehenge, east of Glastonbury, is one of
the wonders of the world.

618
00:54:54,410 --> 00:55:03,640
The big stone circles here were made between
3000 BC and 1600 BC - they are as old as Egypt's

619
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,539
pyramids!

620
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:10,650
One of the most interesting things about Stonehenge
is that some of the stones are very heavy

621
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:18,180
- up to forty tones - but they came from hundreds
of kilometers away, in Wales.

622
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,369
People believe they were probably brought
and pulled to Stonehenge in simple boats.

623
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:27,640
But no one is sure how they got to Stonehenge.

624
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,349
On the longest day of the year, the sun rises
across the stone circles.

625
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:40,230
Because of this, many people think the circles
were perhaps some kind of ancient calendar.

626
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:47,640
In the county of Cornwall, in the far south-west
of England, you can visit the Eden Project.

627
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Here you can see plants and trees from many
different places, and the largest non-wild

628
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,430
rainforest in the world.

629
00:55:55,430 --> 00:56:01,730
Brighton, on the south coast, became an important
town in the mid eighteenth century, when people

630
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,799
began to enjoy swimming in the sea.

631
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:10,769
The Prince of Wales (later King George the
Fourth) started to come to Brighton in the

632
00:56:10,769 --> 00:56:17,140
1780s, and in 1815, the Royal Pavilion was
built for him.

633
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:23,190
The Royal Pavilion, which has a strange mixture
of Indian and Chinese building styles, is

634
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,420
one of the most interesting buildings in Brighton
today.

635
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:35,160
Like Bath, Brighton has some beautiful Georgian
buildings, but it is a fun town too.

636
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,440
Here you can walk on the pier, beside the
sea, or through the Lanes - narrow streets

637
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,509
that were once part of the old fishing village
of Brighton, and which are now busy with shops

638
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:46,809
and restaurants.

639
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:53,220
North-east of Brighton, on the road to Dover,
Canterbury is a place full of history.

640
00:56:53,220 --> 00:57:01,569
It was an important Roman town, and in AD
602, the first cathedral in England was built

641
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,170
here.

642
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:10,890
The cathedral was rebuilt in 1070 and continues
to be very important today: the Archbishop

643
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,320
of Canterbury is the head of the Church of
England.

644
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:25,269
As you can see, there are lots of exciting
places to visit in England!

645
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:37,150
CHAPTER FIVE

646
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:46,400
Nature and the Environment

647
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,410
England has some exciting and beautiful cities,
and many interesting sights.

648
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:57,869
But for a lot of people, the best thing about
England is its countryside.

649
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:06,119
Mostly, England is a place of green hills,
but it also has lakes, rivers, a long coastline

650
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:13,309
that is very different in different parts
of the country and, in the north, mountains.

651
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:17,690
Because there are so many different kinds
of environments in England, there is a lot

652
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,549
of wildlife too.

653
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:28,940
Around the coast you can see seals, sharks,
dolphins and otters; and rabbits, foxes, squirrels

654
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:35,289
and deer are just some of the animals that
move around the countryside freely.

655
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:40,839
Nearly two hundred and thirty different kinds
of birds live in England, and another two

656
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:44,180
hundred visit for part of the year.

657
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:49,630
There are also many different kinds of trees,
plants and wild flowers growing in the English

658
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,630
countryside.

659
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:58,539
The weather in England is temperate - almost
never very, very hot, or very, very cold - with

660
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,910
lots of rain all year.

661
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:08,430
It is usually warmest between June and September,
but the weather in any month can be very different

662
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,359
from year to year.

663
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:17,440
England has ten national parks beautiful areas
of countryside where is the special laws keep

664
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,109
the land and a wildlife safe.

665
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:26,249
The biggest of these is the Lake District,
in the north-west of England.

666
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:33,050
The Lake District has the highest mountains
in the country, with sixteen big lakes lying

667
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,410
below them.

668
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:41,470
With its beautiful scenery, the Lake District
is not surprisingly a very popular place for

669
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,550
tourists.

670
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:49,150
Most visitors come to walk in the mountains,
to go on boats on the lakes and to enjoy the

671
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,480
area's pretty stone-built villages.

672
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,730
There is also a lot of wildlife in the Lake
District, and it is the only place in the

673
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:04,279
country where golden eagles - birds of prey
- live.

674
01:00:04,279 --> 01:00:10,990
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
many poets began to write about the Lake District.

675
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:16,940
The most famous of these was William Wordsworth,
who lived there for sixty years.

676
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:22,920
The poems and books that he wrote about the
Lake District made many people come and visit

677
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,410
the area for the first time.

678
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:31,680
Another famous writer from the Lake District
is Beatrix Potter, whose children's books

679
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,319
about Peter Rabbit and his friends are famous
around the world.

680
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:44,059
Today, a lot of tourists visit the house near
Hawkshead where she wrote many of her books.

681
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:47,999
There are four other national parks in the
north of England.

682
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:54,060
The Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales and
the Northumberland National Park are all part

683
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:59,530
of the Pennines, an area of low mountains
in the middle of the north of England.

684
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:07,490
The Pennine Way, a walking trail 429 kilometers
long, goes along these mountains, which make

685
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,130
a kind of natural border between east and
west.

686
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:18,380
East of the Pennines is the north of England's
other national park, the North York Moors,

687
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,720
between York in the south and Middlesbrough
in the north.

688
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,430
In all these northern national parks, you
can find deep valleys covered with forests,

689
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:35,051
high moorland and wonderful caves (natural
holes in the rock in the hillside), and they

690
01:01:35,051 --> 01:01:40,470
are great places for walking, cycling or horse-riding.

691
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:46,849
People who have read Wuthering Heights, Jane
Eyre, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall or any of

692
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:52,630
the other books by Charlotte, Emily and Anne
Bronte, probably feel that they already know

693
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,440
the countryside of the Pennines.

694
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:02,060
The Bronte sisters lived in Haworth in Yorkshire,
and they describe the windy, heather-covered

695
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,470
moorland of this area in many of their books.

696
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:12,809
The history of the New Forest, about one hundred
kilometers south-west of London, begins more

697
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:16,390
than nine hundred years ago.

698
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:21,819
William the Conqueror wanted this area to
be kept for hunting, and he and his nobles

699
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:26,630
enjoyed looking for deer and other animals
here.

700
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:31,960
Parts of the New Forest, which is now a national
park, have probably not changed very much

701
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,930
since these times.

702
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:40,940
Today, cows walk freely around this area,
with its ancient trees and open land covered

703
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,779
with heather.

704
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:50,819
Visitors here can also see beautiful wild
flowers, deer and big birds of prey.

705
01:02:50,819 --> 01:02:58,259
But most famous are the ponies - about three
thousand of them - that live in the New Forest,

706
01:02:58,259 --> 01:03:01,420
as they have for many years.

707
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:06,150
You can often see them walking around the
villages of the New Forest, and you must be

708
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,430
ready to stop your car when one decides to
cross the road!

709
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:16,970
Between Exeter and Plymouth, the national
park of Dartmoor in Devon is the biggest and

710
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:21,500
wildest area of open countryside in the south
of England.

711
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:27,650
A lot of Dartmoor is moorland and covered
in heather, but Dartmoor is also famous for

712
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,990
its many tors - hills with rocks at the top.

713
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:40,099
Sheep, cows and ponies walk freely around
on Dartmoor, and many birds live here too.

714
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:46,809
North of Dartmoor is the national park of
Exmoor, a beautiful area of moorland, forests,

715
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:52,819
valleys and farmland, which goes across the
counties of Somerset and Devon, right up to

716
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:55,240
the coast.

717
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:02,299
Here you can see otters in nearly every river,
wild red deer, bats and some very special

718
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:03,480
butterflies.

719
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,309
Devon is not only famous for Dartmoor and
Exmoor.

720
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:13,400
The counties of Devon and Cornwall are very
popular with tourists because of their lovely

721
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:20,470
countryside and because they get more hours
of sunlight than anywhere else in England.

722
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:27,289
Away from the coast, the green fields are
full of wild flowers in the summer, and narrow

723
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:34,390
little roads with tall hedges at the side
go from one pretty village to the next.

724
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:41,050
By the sea, there are golden beaches and little
rocky coves, and on the north coast, the big

725
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:47,599
waves in places like Newquay make surfing
a very popular sport.

726
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:53,270
Off the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, you
can see basking sharks and porpoises, and

727
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:58,430
on Lundy Island there are puffins in April
and May.

728
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:04,109
Another beautiful area to visit in this part
of England are the Scilly Isles, about one

729
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:10,819
hundred small islands forty-five kilometers
away from Land's End, in England's far south-west

730
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:11,819
corner.

731
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:18,210
Each island is very different, and people
live on only five of them.

732
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:25,039
Along England's south coast, big white cliffs
- large rocks next to the sea - look out onto

733
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,760
the English Channel.

734
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:33,019
The rocks in the cliffs on part of this coast,
which is called the Jurassic Coast and goes

735
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:39,710
from East Devon to Dorset, are one hundred
and eighty five million years old.

736
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:45,180
Here you can easily find wonderful fossils
- rocks with the shape of animals and plants

737
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,099
from ancient times.

738
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:52,490
You can see lots of fossils here because of
erosion - the rock is very soft, and every

739
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:56,470
day the sea breaks bits of the rock away from
the cliffs.

740
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:02,630
Erosion has made parts of this coast very
beautiful: the perfect little cove at Lulworth

741
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:09,539
in Dorset and the famous arch of Durdle Door
were both made by erosion.

742
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:16,559
England's newest national park is the South
Downs, which comes down to the sea near Brighton.

743
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,769
You can walk through the beautiful green hills
of the South Downs on the South Downs Way,

744
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:27,740
a special walking trail which ends at the
enormous white cliffs of Beachy Head on the

745
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,140
south coast.

746
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:34,819
Most of the North Sea coast of England (on
the east side of the country) is very flat

747
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:42,240
and sandy, with a lot of saltmarsh - wet,
muddy areas with grass growing on them.

748
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:48,070
There are many sea birds here and also, at
Blakeney Point in Norfolk, several hundred

749
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,279
seals.

750
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:55,609
This is the best place in England to see seals,
and many people take special boat trips to

751
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:57,789
visit them.

752
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:02,030
The national park of the Norfolk Broads is
also in this area.

753
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:09,309
Here, three rivers go across flat land to
the sea, and are so wide in places, they are

754
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:11,849
almost like lakes.

755
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:19,059
Many people like to visit this area by boat
or by bike, enjoying the wonderful birdlife.

756
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:25,170
England has a lot of beautiful countryside,
but there are many problems for the environment.

757
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:33,309
Factories, vehicles and modern farming can
make the air, rivers and the sea dirty, and

758
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:37,519
this is bad for plants and wildlife.

759
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:43,489
Many animals also lose their homes when forests
are cut down or land is taken for building

760
01:07:43,489 --> 01:07:46,500
houses on.

761
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:51,480
People believe that global warming (the Earth
getting hotter because of dangerous gases

762
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:57,589
in the air) is bringing new problems to the
countryside too.

763
01:07:57,589 --> 01:08:03,309
It is because of these dangers to the environment
that the national parks of England were made,

764
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:09,180
and there are many organizations that work
to keep wildlife and the English countryside

765
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,250
safe.

766
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:17,310
The UK government is also working with governments
from other countries to try to find ways to

767
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,370
fight global warming.

768
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:25,630
English people hope that they, and the tourists
who come to their country, will always be

769
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:38,060
able to enjoy the wonderful natural environment.

770
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:48,150
CHAPTER SIX

771
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:51,760
Daily Life

772
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,040
For most English teenagers, daily life is
mainly about school.

773
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,080
Education is free for all children aged five
to sixteen.

774
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:08,580
It is also compulsory - everyone must have
an education.

775
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:14,250
As well as state schools, which are run by
the government, there are also independent

776
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,950
schools, which families have to pay for.

777
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:23,980
About six percent of children in England go
to independent schools.

778
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:30,370
Some families also home-school: they teach
their children at home.

779
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:35,310
Children start their compulsory education
in primary school when they are four or five

780
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:40,910
years old, and at age eleven, they move to
secondary school.

781
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:47,080
The school year is from September to July,
with two-week holidays at Christmas and in

782
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,670
the spring, and a longer six-week holiday
in the summer.

783
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:58,410
Between each of these holidays, there is a
one-week break called Half Term, so the school

784
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:02,480
year has got three terms.

785
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:09,080
Most state schools follow the national curriculum,
which tells teachers what subjects to teach.

786
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:17,720
At the end of Year 11, when students are about
sixteen, they take exams called GCSEs in many

787
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,840
different subjects.

788
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:26,830
Some of these subjects, such as math's and
English, are compulsory, but students can

789
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,890
also choose some subjects.

790
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:36,440
After their exams, some students leave education,
and others go to technical colleges, where

791
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,060
they learn how to do the jobs they are interested
in.

792
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:47,890
Others stay at school and study for one or
two more years to do exams called AS-levels

793
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:53,600
and A-levels, this time in only three or four
subjects.

794
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,750
Some students who do well in their A-levels
will go on to study at university for another

795
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,740
three to six years.

796
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:08,730
Most jobs in England today are in the service
industry - in places like hotels, restaurants,

797
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:12,430
shops, computer companies and banks.

798
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,160
Many English people work very hard.

799
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:22,940
The working day is usually from nine o'clock
until five o'clock, with an hour at lunchtime,

800
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:27,500
five days a week, but often people work much
longer hours.

801
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:33,230
It can be very difficult for young people
to find a job, even if they have studied at

802
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,770
university.

803
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:40,580
Some do more training, learning how to do
new things.

804
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:45,140
Others take unpaid work, so they can get experience.

805
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:52,030
In the evenings and at the weekends, many
English people enjoy watching or playing sport,

806
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:58,730
watching TV, playing computer games, or reading
books or newspapers.

807
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:03,710
Sometimes they go out to the cinema or to
a restaurant, or to see their favourite band

808
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,180
play music.

809
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:10,410
Sometimes they just go shopping or spend time
with their friends.

810
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:18,690
Children and teenagers often go to weekly
clubs, for example Scouts, martial arts, dance,

811
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:21,350
drama or music.

812
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:26,810
Most teenagers also have a mobile phone, so
that they can talk to their friends or send

813
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:31,490
them text messages, and an MP3 player for
listening to music.

814
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:38,020
There are lots of things to do at the weekends
and on holidays in England.

815
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:44,890
Many families go out together to museums,
beaches or theme parks, or for walks or cycle

816
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:47,790
rides in the countryside.

817
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:53,620
People also invite friends to their houses
for meals, a cup of tea, or to watch a sports

818
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,250
match on TV.

819
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:02,020
Life in England is very different if you live
in the city or in the countryside.

820
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:09,560
In the city, public transport is usually very
good, and there are many buses and trains.

821
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:15,140
London also has an underground train system,
called the Tube, and you can travel around

822
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,700
Manchester by tram.

823
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:23,210
But in the countryside, people often have
to walk and drive a lot.

824
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:30,060
Most people who live in cities have homes
in the suburbs - the areas around a city.

825
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,390
Cities often also have big estates.

826
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:39,390
These are places built mainly for people to
live in, with lots of houses or flats, and

827
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:42,640
usually some shops and a park.

828
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,610
There are lots of different kinds of homes
for people to live in in England.

829
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:54,921
Some houses are more than six hundred years
old, others are very modern; some people live

830
01:13:54,921 --> 01:14:01,190
in houses with several different rooms and
a garden, others live in small apartments

831
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,650
called flats.

832
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:09,740
In the past, people in England used to buy
their own homes, but houses and flats have

833
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,980
now become very expensive.

834
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:18,710
For young people with little money, it is
now very difficult to buy a home, and more

835
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:25,850
people now rent: they pay money to someone
to live in their house or flat.

836
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:31,580
Most English people usually eat at home because
eating out - eating in a restaurant or cafe

837
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,680
- is expensive.

838
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:41,241
Breakfast is often toast or cereal, and while
some people have a big meal at midday, others

839
01:14:41,241 --> 01:14:47,080
just have a sandwich for lunch and then eat
their main meal in the evening.

840
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,440
This meal can be called supper, dinner or
tea.

841
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:58,980
But for some families, 'tea is a cup of tea
with a biscuit or a piece of cake!

842
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:05,210
Many people now buy their food and all the
other shopping they need from big supermarkets,

843
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:09,600
which are on the outside of almost every town
and city.

844
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,750
These supermarkets are often open all day
and in the evening, and some now stay open

845
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,160
all night too.

846
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:24,820
Other shops usually open at nine o'clock and
close at half-past five or six, with shorter

847
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,010
opening hours on Sundays.

848
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:31,880
Life in England is busier than ever today.

849
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:37,680
Travel around any English city at rush hour
- when people are going to or from work - and

850
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,750
it seems that no one has time for anything.

851
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:48,040
But over a morning coffee or the important
afternoon cup of tea, most English people

852
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:53,720
can always find the time to talk about sport
or the weather, or think of something to laugh

853
01:15:53,720 --> 01:16:05,110
about.

854
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:17,370
CHAPTER SEVEN

855
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,590
Sports

856
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:26,710
Sport is very important in England, and people
enjoy going to big sports events or watching

857
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:31,330
them on TV and playing sport in their free
time.

858
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:39,140
Some of the most popular world sports - football,
rugby, cricket, golf and tennis - first started

859
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:45,120
in England, and people from all around the
world come here for some of its great sports

860
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,730
events.

861
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:53,730
In 2012, the Olympics were held in England,
and millions of people from around the world

862
01:16:53,730 --> 01:17:01,060
came to London to watch the many different
sports of the Olympics and the Paralympics.

863
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:07,540
New sports stadiums were built, including
the main Olympic stadium, a basketball arena

864
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,560
and a velopark, for cycling.

865
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:17,850
It was the first time the Olympics had come
to England since 1948 and was a very exciting

866
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,770
year for the country.

867
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:26,200
The most popular sport in England is football,
and there are professional matches every week

868
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,771
from August until May.

869
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:37,800
Many thousands of people also play in parks,
at local clubs, and at schools or universities.

870
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,440
Football has been played in England for hundreds
of years, and the best football teams, for

871
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:50,690
example Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea
and Arsenal, are famous around the world.

872
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:57,510
The most important day in England's football
calendar is the Football Association (FA)

873
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:02,250
Cup Final day in May at London's Wembley Stadium.

874
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:08,800
Many people believe that England's best ever
footballer was Bobby Charlton, who started

875
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:18,390
playing for Manchester United in 1953 and
scored 249 goals over the next twenty years.

876
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:24,480
In 1958, Charlton was in an aeroplane with
the Manchester United team when it crashed,

877
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,820
killing eight players.

878
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:34,010
Bobby Charlton was not killed in the crash,
and he went on to play in the 1966 World Cup,

879
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,170
which England won.

880
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:41,720
It was the first and only time that England
has won the World Cup.

881
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,920
Cricket was first played in England in the
sixteenth century, and by the eighteenth century,

882
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:51,050
it had become the country's national sport.

883
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:56,780
Every summer, teams from other countries play
five-day Test matches against the English

884
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:59,160
national team.

885
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,280
Cricket is also played on village greens - small
fields in villages - around the country in

886
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,170
the summer months.

887
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:11,940
Because cricket matches are so long, a new
kind of match called the Twenty20 was introduced

888
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,220
in 2003.

889
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:23,120
Twenty20 matches are only three hours long,
so people can watch them in one day.

890
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,680
Rugby is another sport that began in England,
and it is named after the school where it

891
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,690
was first played Rugby School in Warwickshire.

892
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:39,520
Rugby is like football, but players can hold
the ball and tackle each other pull each other

893
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,240
to the ground - to get the ball.

894
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:51,420
Rugby is not as popular as football, but after
England won the World Cup in 2003, more people

895
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,640
began to watch and play the sport.

896
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:02,570
In England, there are two kinds of rugby,
each very different: Rugby League and Rugby

897
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,820
Union.

898
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:10,690
For two weeks around the end of Traditionally,
when people June, England becomes tennis-mad!

899
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:13,820
This is the time of the Wimbledon they eat
strawberries and cream.

900
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:18,330
Championships, the most famous tennis tournament
in the world.

901
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:23,880
Few people watch tennis on TV for the rest
of the year, but during Wimbledon, matches

902
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:28,060
are shown on TV every afternoon and evening.

903
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:34,160
England's most famous tennis player was Fred
Perry, who won the Wimbledon Championship

904
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:40,040
every year for three years, from 1934 to 1936.

905
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:47,140
Since that time, no English player has won
the Men's Championship.

906
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:51,270
Horse-racing is another very popular sport
in England.

907
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:57,390
There are races every day of the year, and
people enjoy making bets on which horse will

908
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,290
win.

909
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:06,630
The Derby at Epsom, which continues to be
held today, was the first derby ever, and

910
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:14,660
derbies - races on flat ground for three-year-old
horses - are now held around the world.

911
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:20,770
Other important dates in horseracing are the
Grand National in Liverpool in April - one

912
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:27,790
of the most difficult horse races in the world
- and Royal Ascot, five days of horse racing

913
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,210
in Berkshire in June.

914
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:37,620
The Queen always goes to Ascot, so it is an
important event in England, and visitors wear

915
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:41,980
their best clothes and hats.

916
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:48,390
Another important day for sport in England
is the London Marathon in April.

917
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:54,060
More than thirty thousand people run in the
London Marathon, which has been held since

918
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,580
1981.

919
01:21:55,580 --> 01:22:03,470
The fastest people finish the forty-two kilometer
run in just over two hours, but for many runners

920
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:08,910
the most important thing is making money for
charity.

921
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:14,850
Watersports are popular in England, and many
people, especially on the south coast, enjoy

922
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,660
sailing.

923
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:22,140
There are good waves for surfing at many of
the beaches in the south-west, and canoeing

924
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:27,510
is also popular on England's many rivers and
canals.

925
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:33,881
Two of England's most famous sportspeople
do a watersport - Steve Redgrave, who won

926
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:42,250
gold medals for rowing at every Olympic Games
between 1984 and 2000, and Ellen MacArthur,

927
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:49,710
who broke the world record for sailing around
the world alone in the fastest time on 7th

928
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:52,040
February 2005.

929
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:57,970
Golf is also a very popular sport for English
people.

930
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:04,770
There are many golf courses in England, and
every July the Open Championship, one of the

931
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:11,390
four biggest tournaments in the world, is
held in England or Scotland.

932
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:17,540
Motor-racing is also well-liked, and many
people go to a course called Silverstone in

933
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:23,160
Northamptonshire every year to watch the British
Grand Prix.

934
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:30,220
At school, children play football, rugby,
netball and cricket, and do athletics in the

935
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,780
summer.

936
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:38,690
There are public swimming pools and gyms in
most towns, and many people also enjoy cycling

937
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:41,230
and walking.

938
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:47,290
Other outdoor activities like mountaineering
- climbing and walking in the hills and mountains

939
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:51,180
- are also very popular in England.

940
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,190
English people love sport.

941
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:59,290
For some time, they have not won many big
events in the sports that first came from

942
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,510
their country many years before.

943
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:13,110
But sport continues to be a very important
part of life in England.

944
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:25,840
CHAPTER EIGHT

945
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,210
Entertainment

946
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:37,750
England is famous around the world for its
great culture and entertainment.

947
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:43,660
Some of the worlds greatest writers, best
films, and most famous actors and directors

948
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:50,120
have come from England, and there are several
hundred theatres and concert halls showing

949
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,540
wonderful plays, music and dance.

950
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:59,820
Literature is a very important part of England's
history, and all around the country you can

951
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,670
visit the homes of some of the many great
English writers.

952
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:11,000
The most famous of these is, of course, William
Shakespeare, but many others have written

953
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,060
great works of literature too.

954
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:20,770
In the late seventeenth century, there were
some fine poets, for example John Milton,

955
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:24,370
who wrote Paradise Lost.

956
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:30,070
Novels only began to be widely written in
the eighteenth century, and one of the earliest

957
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:38,120
of these was Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe,
published in 1719, which continues to be very

958
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,450
popular today.

959
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:45,320
The first half of the nineteenth century was
famous for the Romantic poetry of writers

960
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,640
like Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley
and Keats.

961
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:54,710
Jane Austen was another great writer of this
time.

962
01:25:54,710 --> 01:26:02,280
In books like Emma, Pride and Prejudice and
Persuasion, Austen wrote about how women saw

963
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:06,180
society, marriage and happiness.

964
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:13,950
Famous Victorian writers included Charles
Dickens, the Bronte sisters and George Eliot.

965
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:20,640
In Victorian times, people began for the first
time to write literature just for children,

966
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:26,500
and one of the best-known of these new children's
books was Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures

967
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:33,210
in Wonderland, which continues to be read
by many children even today.

968
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:39,130
Another writer from around this time whose
work is much-loved now is Arthur Conan Doyle,

969
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:41,100
who was Scottish.

970
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:49,170
He wrote stories about Sherlock Holmes, a
London detective, between 1880 and 1907.

971
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:56,080
Sherlock Holmes had a brilliant mind and was
able to find the answers to the strangest

972
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,060
mysteries.

973
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:02,670
The stories of these mysteries were told to
the reader by Sherlock Holmes's great friend

974
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,570
Dr Watson.

975
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:11,330
An important English writer at the beginning
of the twentieth century was Thomas Hardy.

976
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:17,920
Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Far From the Madding
Crowd and Hardy's other novels were often

977
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:24,500
terribly sad stories about people in an imaginary
county called Wessex.

978
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:32,170
Rudyard Kipling was also popular at this time
and from 1910, a new kind of 'modernist' literature

979
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:35,000
became important.

980
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,480
One of the first modernist writers was Joseph
Conrad, who was Polish, but lived in England,

981
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:48,430
and between the two wars there was a lot of
other new literature, from writers like Virginia

982
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:53,650
Woolf, Evelyn Waugh and DH Lawrence.

983
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:59,710
After the Second World War, two of England's
most important writers were George Orwell,

984
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:07,090
who wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal
Farm, and Agatha Christie, who wrote sixty-six

985
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:14,610
detective novels, including the adventures
of Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot.

986
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:20,190
Modern fantasy literature - writing about
magic, monsters and other imaginary things

987
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:28,090
- became popular at this time too, when The
Lord of the Rings, by JRR Tolkien, was published

988
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:29,800
in 1949.

989
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:36,110
Two of the most famous writers of the last
fifty years are children's writers.

990
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:42,910
Roald Dahl, who was born in Wales to Norwegian
parents, wrote books such as Charlie and the

991
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:50,020
Chocolate Factory and Matilda, many of which
also became great films and theatre shows.

992
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:57,260
JK Rowling's Harry Potter series - a group
of seven fantasy books for children - has

993
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:03,470
sold hundreds of millions of copies, and people
can now read them in sixty-seven different

994
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:05,340
languages.

995
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:11,340
Many of these works of literature have become
famous plays, and for many people an important

996
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:15,320
part of any visit to England is a trip to
the theatre.

997
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:21,530
There are several hundred theatres in England,
around the country, but the most famous are

998
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:24,370
the theatres of the West End in London.

999
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:31,270
In the West End, there is a theatre on nearly
every street, showing the latest plays and

1000
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:38,960
musicals, and many of the best actors from
all around the world come to perform here.

1001
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:45,270
Some of the most famous shows in the West
End have been musicals, such as Cats and Phantom

1002
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:51,480
of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Webber, but in
London and around the country, you can also

1003
01:29:51,480 --> 01:30:00,010
see many different kinds of shows, including
more serious plays, new works and comedy.

1004
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:05,630
One of the oldest theatres in London is the
Old Vic, which first began to show plays in

1005
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:07,470
1818.

1006
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:14,830
England also has the National Theatre, on
London's South Bank near the London Eye, which

1007
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:17,270
opened in 1976.

1008
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:24,360
Across the Thames are the Royal Ballet and
the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, and

1009
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,110
the English National Opera at the Coliseum,
the largest theatre in London.

1010
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:36,670
Outside London, England's most famous theatre
is the theatre of the Royal Shakespeare Company

1011
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:42,530
in Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare's
plays are performed throughout the year.

1012
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:49,890
In the summer, you can also see Shakespeare's
plays at the Globe Theatre in London, a round

1013
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:55,610
theatre with no roof, like the one where these
famous plays were first performed more than

1014
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:58,650
four hundred years ago.

1015
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,230
England is important for its music too.

1016
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:08,590
George Frideric Handel, Edward Elgar and Gustav
Holst are three of the country's most famous

1017
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:15,230
classical music composers, and at places like
the Royal Festival Hall and the Barbican Centre

1018
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:21,070
in London, you can hear many different kinds
of classical music, played by some of the

1019
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,670
finest orchestras in the world.

1020
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:30,540
There is also a lot of good classical music
outside London: the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra

1021
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:36,990
is one of the best in Europe, and at many
stately homes and castles around the country

1022
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:40,130
there are outdoor concerts in the summer.

1023
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:44,840
But it is for its pop music that England is
best known.

1024
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:51,620
Together with the USA, the UK brought rock
'n' roll to the world in the 1950s, and The

1025
01:31:51,620 --> 01:32:00,150
Beatles, who became popular in the 1960s,
is one of the most famous bands in the world.

1026
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:07,340
During the 1960s, the Rolling Stones, Cliff
Richard and The Shadows, The Who, The Kinks,

1027
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:14,420
The Animals and many other bands became important
in England, and they started to become famous

1028
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,770
in the USA too.

1029
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:23,140
For a while, the USA began to follow the UK
in music and in fashion.

1030
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,460
In the 1970s, music changed.

1031
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:34,010
First there was glam rock from artists like
David Bowie and Elton John, who coloured their

1032
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:38,130
hair, and wore strange and wonderful clothes
and shoes.

1033
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:46,160
Then came punk rock - short, fast songs, often
with a political message, sung by bands like

1034
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,420
the Clash.

1035
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:57,110
In the 1980s, world music, heavy metal (loud,
hard music) and indie rock were popular, and

1036
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,460
England's dance music culture also began.

1037
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:06,421
But in the late 1990s, some artists turned
against the many fashions in music of the

1038
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:15,670
'80s and early '90s, and Britpop arrived - bands
such as Blur, Oasis and Radiohead that followed

1039
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:21,050
the British guitar music of the 1960s and
'70s.

1040
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:25,730
Several of these bands became famous around
Europe and in the USA.

1041
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:32,290
Today, you can see bands play in clubs in
almost every big city, and there are also

1042
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:38,400
music festivals around the country where people
camp and watch music in big fields.

1043
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,710
The most famous of these is at Glastonbury.

1044
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:46,510
Art-lovers can find a lot to enjoy in England
too.

1045
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:52,640
Two of England's most famous artists were
the landscape painters John Constable and

1046
01:33:52,640 --> 01:34:00,780
JMW Turner, and many of their pictures can
be seen at the Tate Britain gallery in London.

1047
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:06,850
London also has the Tate Modern, of course,
and there are also great exhibitions at the

1048
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:12,750
Royal Academy of Arts, and a lot of Western
European art at the National Gallery in Trafalgar

1049
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,530
Square.

1050
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:22,380
In the 1990s, a group of artists called the
Young British Artists (YBAs) became very popular

1051
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:24,630
in England.

1052
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:33,090
One of the most famous YBAs was Damien Hirst,
who made a lot of art works with dead animals.

1053
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:37,080
Some people love his work, and others hate
it!

1054
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:45,120
Most towns in England have a cinema, and watching
films is a very popular activity for English

1055
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,390
people.

1056
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:52,800
England has made some of the world's greatest
films, and some of the most famous actors

1057
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,260
and directors are English.

1058
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:02,620
The film industry only really started in England
in the 1930s, when some famous films like

1059
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:05,410
The 39 Steps were made.

1060
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:12,390
But it was in the 1950s and 1960s that British
cinema became really important.

1061
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:18,429
At this time, Hammer Horror films like The
Curse of Frankenstein and Dracula were made

1062
01:35:18,429 --> 01:35:25,090
- and Ealing Comedies like Kind Hearts and
Coronets and Whisky Galore.

1063
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:31,420
The first Carry On film was made in 1958,
and by 1992, there were thirty-one.

1064
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:39,130
The Carry On films were comedies that made
jokes about English life.

1065
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:45,190
They were not thought of as important films,
but were loved by many English people.

1066
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:50,520
The James Bond films were another series that
became very famous in England.

1067
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:57,100
The stories were adventures about James Bond,
a secret service agent - someone who worked

1068
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:02,380
secretly for the government, looking for enemies
of the country.

1069
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:10,000
The first Bond film, Dr No, was made in 1962,
and the films became famous for their music,

1070
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,550
Bond's cars and clever equipment, and for
James Bond himself - a character played by

1071
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:18,750
several different actors.

1072
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:26,690
A famous English actor of the 1960s was Julie
Andrews, who appeared in two famous musical

1073
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:30,750
films, The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.

1074
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:35,810
But many people believe that the greatest
actor of the twentieth century was Laurence

1075
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,330
Olivier.

1076
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:45,640
Olivier, who worked in theatre and film from
the 1920s until the 1980s, made nearly sixty

1077
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:50,300
films, including Rebecca and Wuthering Heights.

1078
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:56,920
Also very famous, but as a director not an
actor, was Alfred Hitchcock.

1079
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:04,440
He made many great mystery films in England
and in Hollywood, where he later went to live.

1080
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:10,550
From the 1990s, romantic comedies like Four
Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill were

1081
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:17,710
made, and the Merchant Ivory films of classic
novels like Howard's End.

1082
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:25,030
Since then, some of England's most successful
films have been Love Actually, Slumdog Millionaire

1083
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:27,630
and the Harry Potter series.

1084
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:34,030
But England's most popular kind of entertainment
is television.

1085
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:41,090
Public television first began in England in
1936, and the British Broadcasting Corporation

1086
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:49,710
(the BBC) is the world's oldest and largest
broadcaster Today there are five main channels

1087
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:56,530
in England, and there are also hundreds more
channels on cable and satellite TV.

1088
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:59,330
There are hundreds of radio stations too.

1089
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:05,670
On English TV, there are many different kinds
of programmers, but some of the most popular

1090
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:14,370
ones are sitcoms (situation comedies) - comedies
about people in their home or where they work.

1091
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:20,920
One of the most famous of these was Fawlty
Towers, with the actor John Cleese.

1092
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:27,650
Many people also enjoy soap operas - dramas
which continue from one programme to the next,

1093
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:34,630
for example Eastenders, Coronation Street,
Emmerdale and Hollyoaks.

1094
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:41,490
Another very popular drama series in England
in the 1990s was Inspector Morse, about a

1095
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,360
detective in Oxford.

1096
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:52,090
Many people also enjoy reality programmes
- programmes about ordinary people's lives.

1097
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:57,880
One of the most famous of these is Big Brother,
a programme in which a group of people live

1098
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:02,930
together in a house and are filmed twenty-four
hours a day.

1099
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:08,130
Some of the Big Brother programmes have been
watched by up to six million people in the

1100
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:16,800
UK: England has great music, art, history
and literature, but sometimes people are most

1101
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:29,700
interested in day-to-day life!

1102
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:41,590
CHAPTER NINE

1103
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:44,840
English Heroes

1104
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:51,620
Who are England's heroes - the important people
who will never be forgotten?

1105
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:58,980
One of the greatest must be William Shakespeare,
who wrote many beautiful poems and about thirty-seven

1106
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:06,080
plays, including A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Macbeth.

1107
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:13,270
The people in his plays always seem very real,
and he wrote about their feelings and problems

1108
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:19,900
in words that continue to sound new and interesting
today.

1109
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:25,710
Another hero of England from the world of
literature is Charles Dickens.

1110
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:32,860
Dickens wrote some of the best novels of Victorian
times, including Oliver Twist, David Copperfield,

1111
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,820
Bleak House and Little Dorrit.

1112
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:41,720
Dickens used his books to show how terrible
life was for poor people in England at the

1113
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:44,250
time of the industrial revolution.

1114
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:51,340
But England has scientific heroes as well
as heroes from the world of literature.

1115
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:55,090
One of the greatest of these was Sir Isaac
Newton.

1116
01:40:55,090 --> 01:41:03,290
Born in Lincolnshire in 1643, Newton studied
at the University of Cambridge.

1117
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:08,480
He was able to understand and explain many
things about the world around us for the first

1118
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:15,390
time, and his book Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy was very important in

1119
01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:17,910
the history of science.

1120
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:23,840
Newton helped people to understand about light
and colour, and he was also the first person

1121
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:29,410
to explain gravity - the force that pulls
things towards the ground.

1122
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:34,410
Charles Darwin also did scientific work in
England.

1123
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:42,770
He was born into a rich family, and in 1831
he left England to travel around the world.

1124
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:48,410
Darwin studied the animals and plants that
he saw on his trip, and was interested in

1125
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:51,320
the differences between them.

1126
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:58,490
When he came home, he began to work on a new
idea: the theory of evolution.

1127
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:04,800
This was the idea that only the strongest
animals and plants lived and reproduced - had

1128
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,780
babies or grew seeds.

1129
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:15,250
And so, Darwin believed, each kind of animal
and plant was slowly changing.

1130
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:23,490
In 1859, Darwin published his ideas in the
book On the Origin of Species.

1131
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:31,540
One very real hero of England was Horatio
Nelson, who was leader of the Royal Navy from

1132
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,020
1794 to 1805.

1133
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:42,501
Nelson, who lost one eye and one arm in battle,
was a great leader, and with him, Britain

1134
01:42:42,501 --> 01:42:47,140
won many battles against France during the
Napoleonic Wars.

1135
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:53,770
At the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson helped
to stop the French from invading Britain,

1136
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:56,090
but he was then killed.

1137
01:42:56,090 --> 01:43:02,840
A very large statue of him stands forty-six
meters high in Trafalgar Square and is one

1138
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,370
of London's best-loved sights.

1139
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:12,490
Two other important English seamen were Sir
Francis Drake and Captain Cook.

1140
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:20,150
Sir Francis Drake helped to lead England against
the Spanish Armada in 1588, and Captain Cook

1141
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:27,460
was the first European to reach the east coast
of Australia, in 1770.

1142
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:35,330
Winston Churchill, prime minister from 1940
until 1945, was another English hero for many

1143
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:38,700
people during World War Two.

1144
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:44,650
Churchill was a strong leader, and many people
believe that the speeches and radio broadcasts

1145
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:50,530
he made during the war helped the UK to win
the war.

1146
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:59,570
He was prime minister again from 1951 to 1955,
and when he died in 1965, the Queen gave him

1147
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:07,340
a state funeral - a special funeral that is
normally only for kings and queens.

1148
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:10,920
Another famous politician was Margaret Thatcher.

1149
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:18,880
Thatcher was prime minister from 1979 to 1990
- longer than any other person in the twentieth

1150
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:25,820
century - and she was also the first woman
prime minister of the UK.

1151
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:30,940
One of England's most famous heroes is not
actually real.

1152
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:36,670
Stories about Robin Hood have been popular
since the Middle Ages, and in modern times

1153
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:41,930
many films, plays and TV programmes have been
made about him.

1154
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:49,060
In these old stories, Robin Hood is a great
fighter and an outlaw - someone who does not

1155
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:51,150
follow the law.

1156
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:57,400
Living in Sherwood Forest at a time when the
king of England is a dishonest man, he takes

1157
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:01,800
money from the rich to give it to the poor.

1158
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:08,670
Florence Nightingale was famous for helping
people too - but she was a real person.

1159
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:14,550
Florence Nightingale is thought of by many
as the first real nurse.

1160
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:21,600
In 1854, during the Crimean War, she went
to work in a hospital for soldiers.

1161
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:30,080
She thought that it was dirty and badly organized,
so she quickly started to make important changes.

1162
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:35,820
Because of her, the hospital became cleaner,
the soldiers were given good food and taken

1163
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:40,640
care of better, and soon fewer people were
dying.

1164
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:46,400
When she came back to England, Florence Nightingale
started the first proper nursing school at

1165
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,610
St Thomas' Hospital.

1166
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:53,750
England also has heroes of the stage and screen.

1167
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:59,770
One of the first of these was Charlie Chaplin,
a comedy actor and director who was famous

1168
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:06,240
for his many silent films in the years before
films with sound were made.

1169
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:12,510
Chaplin's best-known character was 'The Tramp',
a funny little man with a hat, a moustache

1170
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:14,110
and a stick.

1171
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:21,420
Before the end of the First World War, Chaplin
was the most famous film actor in the world.

1172
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:26,680
But probably the greatest stage heroes of
England are The Beatles.

1173
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:35,091
John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr had their first hit, Love

1174
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:44,420
Me Do, in 1962, and by 1964, they had become
famous around the world.

1175
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:50,900
There was international 'Beatlemania: people
screamed and shouted when the band came on

1176
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:55,120
stage, and the world watched everything they
did.

1177
01:46:55,120 --> 01:47:00,780
The Beatles were the first English band to
become successful in the USA.

1178
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:08,400
They made more than two hundred songs and
are the best-selling band in history.

1179
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:15,940
Two more musical heroes of England, famous
in a quieter way, are the composers George

1180
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:20,710
Frideric Handel and Sir Edward Elgar.

1181
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:30,360
Handel was German, but came to live in London
in 1712 and became British in 1727.

1182
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:36,390
He is one of the greatest composers in history
and is best known for wonderful works like

1183
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:41,640
Water Music and The Messiah, written in 1742.

1184
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:51,880
Elgar's most famous works are the Enigma Variations,
written in 1899, The Dream of Gerontius and

1185
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:55,670
the Pomp and Circumstance Marches.

1186
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:59,170
What about modern-day English heroes?

1187
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:03,320
For many football lovers, David Beckham is
a hero.

1188
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:11,080
He was captain of the England football team
from 2000 until 2006 and, along with his wife

1189
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:19,130
Victoria, who was once in the band the Spice
Girls, Beckham is a very famous celebrity.

1190
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:24,010
Princess Diana is also, for many people, an
English hero.

1191
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:31,860
Diana was the first wife of Charles, the Prince
of Wales, and when they married in 1981, people

1192
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:35,040
believed that she would one day be the queen.

1193
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:42,380
But they were not happy together, and in 1996
Charles and Diana ended their marriage.

1194
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:48,200
A year later, Diana was killed in a car accident
in Paris.

1195
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:55,130
Many people loved her for her work with international
charities and because she showed great kindness

1196
01:48:55,130 --> 01:49:00,030
to children, ill people and those with difficult
lives.

1197
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:05,740
When she died, thousands of people brought
flowers to her London home, and two-and-a-half

1198
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:19,260
billion people watched her funeral on TV.

1199
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:31,490
CHAPTER TEN

1200
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:32,570
Looking Forward

1201
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:40,970
All through England's history, small inventions
- new things that people make - have brought

1202
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:44,340
big changes to peoples lives.

1203
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:50,970
When William Caxton made the first English
printing press in 1476, the country changed

1204
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:52,570
in many ways.

1205
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:59,270
Now people could get more books, more cheaply,
and so they could get information about lots

1206
01:49:59,270 --> 01:50:01,640
of different things.

1207
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:08,100
Because of this, information also became more
standardized: it was written down in the same

1208
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:13,040
way each time, which was important in areas
like science.

1209
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:17,210
The printing press changed the English language
too.

1210
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:23,080
At that time, people in different parts of
the country used very different words, but

1211
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:28,500
William Caxton only printed books in standardized
English.

1212
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:36,330
The spinning Jenny, invented in 1764 by James
Hargreaves, brought more important changes

1213
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:38,590
to England.

1214
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:43,610
With the spinning Jenny, people working in
their homes in England could spin cotton more

1215
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:47,780
quickly and so make much more.

1216
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:53,650
Other machines followed, and when steam power
was introduced, cloth making became a proper

1217
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:55,040
industry.

1218
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:01,510
Cloth-makers did not work at home anymore;
they used big machines in factories in the

1219
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,260
cities.

1220
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:09,580
This was the beginning of the industrial revolution,
and in twenty- first century England, people

1221
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:15,740
are in the middle of another revolution, or
great change, again started by several small

1222
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:17,900
inventions.

1223
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:22,760
One of the most important of these was the
invention by the Englishman Tim Berners-Lee,

1224
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,840
in 1990, of the World Wide Web.

1225
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:34,000
The World Wide Web has made it easier than
ever for people to get information.

1226
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,240
Its invention is part of the digital revolution,
which has given us mobile phones, computers,

1227
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:47,280
MP3 players, digital TV and much, much more.

1228
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:52,490
The digital revolution is changing many things
about life in England.

1229
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:59,140
We can now talk on the telephone almost anywhere,
send messages quickly around the world and

1230
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:03,530
see people who are thousands of kilometers
away through our computers.

1231
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:10,300
Because of this, people can study or work
from home more easily, and work with people

1232
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:12,470
in different countries.

1233
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:18,410
We can shop and meet people on the Internet,
read books on our computers and watch hundreds

1234
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:21,370
of different TV channels.

1235
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:27,160
And the machines we use every day, like radios,
washing machines and cameras, are becoming

1236
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,670
better and cheaper all the time.

1237
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:34,140
But the digital revolution is also bringing
new problems.

1238
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:41,010
Many people feel that modern technology makes
life busier and sometimes more difficult.

1239
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:49,150
We can work wherever we are now, so for some
people there is less time to think or to relax.

1240
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:54,870
Is it good for children to play computer games
and watch TV so much?

1241
01:52:54,870 --> 01:53:00,040
And are we forgetting how to meet people and
make real friends because we talk to people

1242
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,170
through computers so much now?

1243
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:08,420
These are all difficult questions for England's
future, and there are other questions we are

1244
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:11,290
trying to answer now too.

1245
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:17,240
For a long time, we have known that there
are big environmental problems in the world.

1246
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:25,110
Factories, cars, and burning coal, oil or
gas for fuel all make our air dirty, giving

1247
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:27,410
us global warming.

1248
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:32,170
So now we need to find ways to help the environment.

1249
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:38,130
Many English homes and companies are already
getting their electricity from solar (sun)

1250
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:44,460
or wind power, and the government is giving
money to people who use these renewable energies

1251
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:48,400
- ones that can be used again and again.

1252
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:55,960
In the future, we will probably use less and
less coal, oil and gas.

1253
01:53:55,960 --> 01:54:04,150
Many English people have been recycling more
and more of their rubbish, and by 2011, they

1254
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:06,990
were recycling forty percent of their rubbish.

1255
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:14,630
In the future, many people also believe that
we will use electric cars more and other energy-saving

1256
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:16,500
technologies.

1257
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,370
The digital and environmental revolutions
are changing England.

1258
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:28,900
England in 2100 will be a very different place
to the England we now know.

1259
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,840
Will England have a king or queen?

1260
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:36,520
Will there continue to be big differences
between rich and poor people?

1261
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:39,900
How many different languages will people speak?

1262
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:43,370
And will England have won the Football World
Cup again?

1263
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:45,550
We cannot know.

1264
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:50,970
But we can probably hope that people will
continue to watch Shakespeare's plays, climb

1265
01:54:50,970 --> 01:54:55,740
the mountains of the Lake District and visit
the sights of London.

1266
01:54:55,740 --> 01:55:01,460
And perhaps they will still say that England
is a wonderful, exciting place.
