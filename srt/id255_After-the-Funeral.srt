00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,440
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,880
Old Lanscombe, the butler at 
Enderby Hall, shook his head.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,760
Soon they would be coming back 
from his Master's funeral.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,040
Mr Richard Abernethie had been a good employer.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,040
He had died very suddenly, aged sixty-eight.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,320
Although he was ill, the family doctor thought 
that he would live for another two years.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,600
Ah, but the Master had never recovered 
from his son's death, six months before.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,960
Mortimer Abernethie's death 
was a huge shock because he  

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,800
was such a strong and healthy young man.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,320
Mr Richard was twenty-four when 
his father, Cornelius, died,  

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,080
and he had gone straight into the family business.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,760
He ran it successfully while keeping a very 
happy home in this huge Victorian house.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
He was like a father to his 
younger brothers and sisters.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:21,920
Now Leo, Laura, Geraldine, and Gordon were 
dead, only Timothy and Cora were left.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
It had been twenty-five years 
since Lanscombe had seen Cora,  

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,160
and he hadn't recognized her when 
she arrived before the funeral.

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:42,080
She had grown so fat - and was dressed in a 
loose black dress with too many black necklaces!

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,960
Well, Miss Cora had always 
been a bit - well, strange.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,240
She had remembered him all right.

20
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,840
'Why, it's Lanscombe!' she had said, 
and seemed so pleased to see him.

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Ah, they had all been fond of him in the old days.

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Now cars were arriving, bringing the family home,  

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,440
and Lanscombe showed them all 
into the green sitting room.

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,880
A few minutes later, standing 
in front of the fireplace,  

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,040
Mr Entwhistle, the family lawyer, looked round.

26
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,240
He did not know all the people there very 
well - some he had only met before the  

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,800
funeral and he needed to sort them out 
in his mind before he read the will.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,960
When he saw old Lanscombe handing round drinks,  

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Mr Entwhistle thought, 'Poor old man 
- he's nearly ninety, and half blind.

30
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Well, he'll have that nice 
little inheritance from Richard.'

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Leo Abernethie's widow.

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Helen, he knew well.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,200
She was a very charming woman of fifty-one.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,840
It was strange that she had never married 
again after Leo's death, he thought.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Mr Entwhistle moved his attention on to 
George Crossfield, Laura Abernethie's son.

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,760
Laura had left very little money 
when she died five years ago.

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:39,400
George was a lawyer and a handsome young man 
- but there was a dishonest feel about him.

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,120
Now which of the two young women was 
which? Ah yes, that was Rosamund,  

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Geraldine's daughter, looking at the 
wax flowers on the green marble table.

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,040
She was a beautiful girl, but silly.

41
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,680
She was an actress, not a very good 
one, and she had married an actor,  

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,240
Michael Shane, fair-haired and handsome.

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,800
And he knows he is, thought Mr Entwhistle.

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,880
Susan, the late Gordon Abernethie's daughter, 
would be much better on the stage than Rosamund,  

45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,760
Mr Entwhistle thought - she 
had far more personality.

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,960
She also had dark hair and eyes 
that were almost golden in colour.

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,120
Beside her was Gregory Banks, 
the man she had just married.

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
He was a pharmacist's assistant!

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,320
In Mr Entwhistle's world, girls did 
not marry men who worked in a shop.

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,320
The young man, who had a pale 
face, seemed uncomfortable.

51
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,720
His eyes went on to Mrs Maude Abernethie.

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,840
A big, sensible woman, she had 
always been a good wife to Timothy,  

53
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,960
who had been an invalid for many years.

54
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Mr Entwhistle suspected that Timothy 
only imagined that he was ill,  

55
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,880
that he was a hypochondriac, in fact.

56
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,640
Then Mr Entwhistle looked next at Cora Lansquenet.

57
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,080
Her mother had died giving birth to her.

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,280
Poor little Cora!

59
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,720
She was an awkward girl, 
always saying the wrong thing.

60
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
She met Pierre

61
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,560
Lansquenet, who was half French, at art school.

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,560
At the time, Cora's brother, Richard 
Abernethie, suspected that Lansquenet was  

63
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:04,680
looking for a rich wife, but Cora, who was 
not rich, ran away and married him anyway.

64
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,080
They spent most of their married life in seaside  

65
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
towns that other painters 
seemed to live in, as well.

66
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:22,560
Lansquenet was a very bad painter, but Richard 
had generously given his young sister an income.

67
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:32,040
Lansquenet had died twelve years ago, and now here 
was his widow, back in the home of her childhood,  

68
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,880
exclaiming with pleasure whenever she 
recalled some childish memory.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

69
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,480
CHAPTER TWO

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:51,000
'As you know,' said Mr Entwhistle, 'I am the 
executor of Richard Abernethie's will...'

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,960
'I didn't know,' interrupted Cora Lansquenet.

72
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,520
'Did he leave me anything?'

73
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Ignoring her, Entwhistle continued, 'Originally,  

74
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,000
Richard Abernethie's will left almost 
everything to his son Mortimer.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
After Mortimer's death, Richard 
decided to get to know his nephew  

76
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,280
and nieces better before he made a new will.'

77
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,400
'Did he leave me anything?' repeated Cora.

78
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Mr Entwhistle again ignored her, 
Apart from a legacy to Lanscombe,  

79
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:41,120
everything Richard owned is going 
to be divided into six equal parts.

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,280
Four of these will go to: 
Richard's brother Timothy;  

81
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:54,320
his nephew George Crossfield; and his 
nieces Susan Banks and Rosamund Shane.

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,440
The other two parts are going to be invested 
and the income from them will be paid to Mrs  

83
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:11,320
Helen Abernethie, the widow of his brother 
Leo; and to his sister, Mrs Cora Lansquenet.

84
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,240
After their death the money 
is to be divided between the  

85
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,320
other four beneficiaries or their children.'

86
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,760
'That's very nice!' said Cora Lansquenet.

87
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,840
'How much?'

88
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,000
'About three to four thousand pounds a year.'

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
'Good!' said Cora.

90
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,240
'I shall go and visit Italy.'

91
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Helen Abernethie said softly, 
'How generous of Richard.'

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,760
'He was very fond of you,' said Mr Entwhistle.

93
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,000
Helen said regretfully, 'I wish 
I had realised how ill he was.'

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,720
'Nobody expected Richard to die as soon as he did.

95
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,600
Even the doctor was 
surprised,' said Mr Entwhistle.

96
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,680
'"Suddenly, at his residence" it 
said in the newspaper,' said Cora.

97
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,240
'I wondered then...

98
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,880
Still, it's been kept quiet very nicely, 
hasn't it? I think you're all right.

99
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,360
I mean - it should be kept in the family.'

100
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,840
The faces that had turned 
towards her looked amazed.

101
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Mr Entwhistle said, 'Really, Cora, I'm 
afraid I don't understand what you mean.'

102
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,560
Cora Lansquenet looked round in surprise.

103
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,960
'But he was murdered, wasn't 
he?' she said.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

104
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,600
CHAPTER THREE

105
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,200
As he returned south to London by train,  

106
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,360
Mr Entwhistle thought about what Cora 
had said, and how everyone had reacted.

107
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,520
Maude had exclaimed, 'Really, Cora!'

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,120
Somebody else had said, 'What do you mean?'

109
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,840
And at once Cora had said, 
'Oh, I didn't mean - oh,  

110
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:34,880
but I did think from what he said 
- and his death was so sudden!

111
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:46,120
Oh, please forget that I said anything at all 
- I know I'm always saying the wrong thing.'

112
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,080
And then there had been a discussion about 
Richard Abernethie's personal belongings.

113
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,960
The house and its contents, Mr 
Entwhistle said, would be sold.

114
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,840
Cora's unfortunate comment had been forgotten.

115
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:10,480
After all, Cora had always been, if 
not subnormal, embarrassingly naive.

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,280
She had always said unwelcome truths.

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,240
Mr Entwhistle's thoughts stopped there.

118
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,200
Yes, it was because Cora's comments were 
true, that they were so embarrassing!

119
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:36,360
When Mr Entwhistle had looked at Cora earlier, 
she had not looked like the girl he had known.

120
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,120
But Cora's mannerisms were 
still there - such as the  

121
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,360
way she tilted her head to one side as she spoke.

122
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,280
He remembered two phrases now.

123
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:59,240
But I did think from what he said...' 
and 'His death was so sudden.'

124
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,600
Yes, Richard's death had been sudden.

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,720
Richard's doctor had said only months 
ago that if Richard looked after himself,  

126
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,080
he might live two or three years.

127
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,320
Perhaps longer.

128
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,880
Well, doctors could never be sure about 
how each patient would react to a disease.

129
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,160
And Richard Abernethie had no great wish to 
live after his son Mortimer's death because  

130
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:41,600
there was no child or grandchild of his 
to inherit his fortune and his business.

131
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,680
During the last six months, Richard, who 
had obviously been searching for an heir,  

132
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,400
had invited to stay with him, at 
different times, his nephew George,  

133
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,120
his niece Susan and her husband, and 
his niece Rosamund and her husband.

134
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,320
Richard had also briefly visited 
his hypochondriac brother, Timothy.

135
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,080
The will that Richard had eventually made told Mr  

136
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Entwhistle how disappointed 
he was with all of them.

137
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,920
Mr Entwhistle remembered what 
Cora had said earlier that day,  

138
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,720
'I did think from what he said...'

139
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:38,080
He asked himself, What did Richard say? And when 
did he say it? Did Richard visit Cora Lansquenet  

140
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,920
or was it something he wrote in a letter to 
her which made her ask that shocking question:

141
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:55,760
'But he was murdered, wasn't he?'

142
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,800
Further along the train, Gregory 
Banks said to his wife, Susan,  

143
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,440
'That aunt of yours must be completely mad!'

144
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,360
'Aunt Cora? Oh, yes.'

145
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,520
George Crossfield said sharply.

146
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,080
'She really shouldn't say things like that.

147
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,400
It might put ideas into people's heads.'

148
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,280
Rosamund's husband, Michael, 
said, 'I think George is right.

149
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,200
It's so easy to start people talking.'

150
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,240
'Well, would it matter? It 
might be fun,' said Rosamund.

151
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,200
'Fun?' Four voices spoke at once.

152
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,880
'Having a murder in the family,' said Rosamund.

153
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:57,880
'And if he was murdered, who do you think did it? 
His death has been very convenient for all of us.

154
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,000
Michael and I are completely broke.

155
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
Michael was offered a really good part in  

156
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,080
a play if he could afford to 
wait for it, but he couldn't.

157
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,800
Now we'll have enough money for 
our own play if we want to.'

158
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,160
Nobody was listening.

159
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,640
They were thinking about their own futures.

160
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,360
'Now I can put my clients' 
money back in their accounts  

161
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,760
before they notice it's missing,' thought George.

162
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Gregory thought, 'Now I can 
escape from this prison I'm in.'

163
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,720
Susan's hard, young eyes softened 
as she looked at her husband.

164
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
She suspected that Greg loved her less than she  

165
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,080
loved him - but that only 
strengthened her feelings.

166
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,400
Greg was hers; she would do anything for him.

167
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,360
Anything.

168
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,800
Maude Abernethie, who was 
staying the night at Enderby,  

169
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,120
wondered if she should offer to stay longer 
to help Helen with the clearing of the house.

170
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,520
But she really had to get back 
to Timothy to look after him.

171
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,280
He had expected that most of Richard's 
fortune would come to him and he would  

172
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,320
be annoyed - and that was so bad for his health.

173
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,600
She sighed, then smiled.

174
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,320
Things were going to be much 
easier now, financially.

175
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,920
They could spend money on plants 
for the garden, for instance.

176
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,680
Helen Abernethie sat by the fire in 
the sitting room at Enderby Hall.

177
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,720
How worried she had been lately about money.

178
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,640
Now, thanks to Richard, all that was over.

179
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:10,280
Helen looked at the bouquet of wax flowers 
that stood on the green marble table.

180
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,120
Cora had been sitting beside it when they 
had been waiting to go to the funeral.

181
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,680
She had been so pleased at 
being back in her old home.

182
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:31,560
Oh, but the way Cora had asked, 
'But he was murdered, wasn't he?'

183
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,480
The faces all round, shocked, staring at her!

184
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,480
And suddenly, seeing the picture of 
everyone clearly in her mind, Helen frowned.

185
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
There was something wrong with that picture.

186
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Was it an expression on someone's face? Was that 
it? Something that should not have been there?

187
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:11,440
No, she didn't know what it was - but there 
had been something, somewhere, that was wrong.

188
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,800
Meanwhile, in the cafe at Swindon Railway Station,  

189
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:22,560
a lady in black was waiting for the connecting 
train to Lytchett St Mary, where she lived.

190
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,960
She was eating cakes and 
looking forward to the future.

191
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,000
All those faces - when she 
had said that about murder!

192
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,720
Well, it had been the right thing to say.

193
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
She smiled like a happy child.

194
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,840
She was really going to enjoy 
herself at last.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

195
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,400
CHAPTER FOUR

196
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,680
At a quarter to six the next evening 
Mr Entwhistle's telephone rang.

197
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
The caller informed him  

198
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:08,720
that Mrs Cora Lansquenet had been murdered in 
her cottage in the village of Lytchett St Mary.

199
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,960
The next day a police Inspector named Morton came 
to see him and said, 'It's not a very easy case.

200
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,200
Mr Entwhistle.

201
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:27,360
Let's imagine someone was watching Cora 
Lansquenet's house and saw her companion.

202
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,520
Miss Gilchrist, come out of 
the house at about two o'clock.

203
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,440
This someone then deliberately takes the 
hatchet that was lying by the woodshed,  

204
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:49,880
smashes the kitchen window, gets into the house, 
goes upstairs, and attacks Mrs Lansquenet.

205
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,760
She was hit six or eight times 
- it was a very violent crime.

206
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:05,600
Then he opens a few cupboards, picks up a few 
pieces of cheap jewellery, and makes his escape.'

207
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,880
'She was in bed?'

208
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
'Yes.

209
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,440
She returned late from the North the night 
before and woke with a terrible headache.

210
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,240
She took some painkillers but 
felt no better by lunchtime.

211
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,160
She decided to take two sleeping pills and sent  

212
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,800
Miss Gilchrist into town to 
change some library books.

213
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:38,160
When this man broke in he could have taken 
what he wanted just by threatening her.

214
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:46,880
Why did he need to kill her? It looks like she 
was sleeping peacefully when she was attacked.'

215
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,080
'We do hear of pointless 
murders,' Mr Entwhistle said.

216
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh yes, that's why we're looking 
for any suspicious stranger who  

217
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,400
was seen in the neighbourhood: 
the local people all have alibis.

218
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,840
Of course, her cottage is up a 
little road outside the village.

219
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,960
Anyone could get there without being seen.

220
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,000
There has been no rain for some days,  

221
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,760
so there aren't any car tracks to 
go by - in case anyone came by car.

222
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,400
'There are strange things 
about the case, Mr Entwhistle.

223
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:39,400
These, for instance.' Inspector Morton pushed 
across his desk a collection of cheap jewellery.

224
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,400
'Those are the things that were taken.

225
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,440
They were found just outside 
the house, hidden in a bush.

226
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,640
'Of course the companion, Miss Gilchrist, may 
have killed Miss Lansquenet, but I doubt it.

227
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,520
Everyone says they were very friendly.'  

228
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:09,680
He paused before continuing, 'According to 
you, nobody gains from Mrs Lansquenet's death.'

229
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,960
'I didn't say that,' replied Mr Entwhistle.

230
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,560
'Mrs Lansquenet's income was an allowance made 
to her by her brother, her house is rented,  

231
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:28,520
and the furniture and jewellery would not 
be worth much to whoever she's left it to.

232
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,320
However, her legacy from her brother will be 
divided amongst the five other beneficiaries  

233
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,560
of Richard Abernethie's will, so all 
of them will benefit from her death.'

234
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,160
The Inspector looked disappointed.

235
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,280
'Well, there doesn't seem to be 
a strong motive there for anyone  

236
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,400
to kill her - and especially not with a hatchet.

237
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,800
You'll be going to see Miss Gilchrist, 
I suppose? She's told us, I think,  

238
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,240
everything that she can, but you never know.

239
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
Sometimes, in conversation, 
people remember things.

240
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,640
She's a sensible woman - and 
she's really been most helpful.'

241
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Strange, thought Mr Entwhistle, that Cora had been  

242
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,520
thinking about murder the very day 
before she herself was murdered.

243
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,920
'He was murdered, wasn't he?'

244
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,480
It was too ridiculous to 
mention to Inspector Morton.

245
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,440
But what if Miss Gilchrist could tell 
him what Richard had said to Cora? I must  

246
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:57,160
see Miss Gilchrist immediately, 
said Mr Entwhistle to himself.

247
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,360
Miss Gilchrist was a thin 
woman with short, grey hair.

248
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,360
'I'm so pleased you have come, 
Mr Entwhistle,' she said.

249
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,920
'I've never, ever had any 
involvement with a murder.

250
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:21,480
You read about them, of course, but 
I don't even really like doing that.'

251
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Following her into the sitting room, 
Mr Entwhistle looked around him.

252
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,160
There was a strong smell of oil paint 
and the cottage walls were covered  

253
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,280
with mostly very dark and dirty oil paintings.

254
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,640
But there were watercolour paintings as well,  

255
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,760
and smaller pictures were in 
a pile on the window seat.

256
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:54,600
'Mrs Lansquenet used to buy paintings 
at sales,' Miss Gilchrist explained.

257
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,720
'She never paid more than a pound for any of them,  

258
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:07,320
and there was a wonderful chance, she 
always said, of finding something valuable.'

259
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,080
Entwhistle doubted if any of these were 
worth even the pound she had paid for them!

260
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,440
Of course, said Miss Gilchrist, noticing 
his expression, 'I don t know much myself,  

261
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,400
though my father was a painter 
- not a very successful one.

262
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:34,360
But I used to do watercolours myself as a 
girl and it was nice for Mrs Lansquenet to  

263
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,840
have someone she could talk to about 
painting and who would understand.'

264
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,000
'You were fond of her?'

265
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,520
Oh yes, said Miss Gilchrist.

266
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,720
'In some ways, Mrs Lansquenet 
was just like a child.

267
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,520
She said anything that came into her 
head - but it surprised me sometimes how  

268
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,560
accurate she could be about 
things other than art.'

269
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,280
'You were with Mrs Lansquenet for some years?'

270
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,320
Three and a half.

271
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,080
I didmost of the cooking- I enjoy 
cooking - and some light housework.

272
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,040
None of the rough housework, of course.

273
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,960
Mrs Panter came in for that.

274
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,320
I could not possibly have

275
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,680
been a servant.

276
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:35,280
I used to have a little tearoom: The 
Willow Tree - it was a lovely place.

277
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,400
All the cups and plates were blue 
and the cakes were really good.

278
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,240
I was doing well and then the 
war came and food supplies were  

279
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,520
cut and I had to close the tearoom 
and had no money to pay the rent.

280
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:02,040
And so I had to look round for something to 
do, but, I had never been trained for anything.

281
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,720
I went to work for one lady as her companion,  

282
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:13,480
but she was so rude - and then I came 
to Mrs Lansquenet and we were friends  

283
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:24,180
from the start.' Miss Gilchrist added sadly, 
'How I loved my dear, dear little tearoom.

284
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,160
Such nice people used to come to it!

285
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,800
'But I must not talk about myself.

286
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,960
The police have been very kind.

287
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,200
Inspector Morton even arranged for me to 
spend the night with someone in the village,  

288
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:51,520
but I felt it was my duty to stay here with 
all Mrs Lansquenet's nice things in the house.

289
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,480
The Inspector told me there would be 
a policeman on duty in the kitchen  

290
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:04,600
all night - because of the broken window - it 
was fixed this morning - though to be honest,  

291
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:12,400
I did pull the dressing table across the door...'

292
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,320
Mr Entwhistle said quickly, 
'I know the main facts,  

293
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,640
but if it would not upset you too much to 
give me your own story of what happened...?'

294
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,080
'Of course.'

295
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:35,680
'Mrs Lansquenet got back from the funeral 
the night before last,' Mr Entwhistle said.

296
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,840
'Did she talk about the funeral at all?'

297
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,800
'Just a little.

298
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,680
I gave her a cup of hot milk and she 
told me that the church had been full  

299
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,280
and that she was sorry she hadn't 
seen her other brother - Timothy.

300
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,120
Well, then she said she would go to bed.'

301
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,160
'She said nothing else that 
you can remember specially?'

302
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,280
'She asked me if I would like to go to Italy.

303
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,720
Italy!

304
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,360
Of course I said it would 
be wonderful - and she said,  

305
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,400
"We'll go!" She told me that her 
brother had left her a very good income.

306
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,920
Poor dear.

307
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,040
Well, I'm glad she had the pleasure of planning.'  

308
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:38,160
Miss Gilchrist sighed, 'I don't suppose 
I shall ever go to Italy now...'

309
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,960
'And the next morning? ' Mr Entwhistle asked.

310
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,160
'The next morning Mrs 
Lansquenet wasn't at all well.

311
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:55,400
She'd had almost no sleep at all, 
she told me, because of bad dreams.

312
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:04,640
She had her breakfast in bed, and at lunchtime she 
told me that she still hadn't been able to sleep.

313
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,800
"I keep thinking of things 
and wondering," she said.

314
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,280
And then she said that she would take some  

315
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,400
sleeping tablets and try and get 
a good sleep in the afternoon.

316
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,680
She wanted me to go into town 
and change her library books.

317
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:37,200
So I left just after two and that - and that - 
was the last time...' Miss Gilchrist began to cry.

318
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:46,040
'She must have been asleep, you know, and the 
Inspector says that she didn't feel anything...

319
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,960
And do tell her relations that 
apart from having such a bad night,  

320
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,920
she was really very happy and 
looking forward to the future.'

321
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:06,800
'She did not speak at all about her 
brother's death? The - er - cause of it?'

322
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,040
'No.

323
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:16,160
He had been ill for some time,' said Miss 
Gilchrist, 'though I was surprised to hear it.

324
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:27,200
He looked so very full of life.' Mr 
Entwhistle said quickly, 'You saw him? When?'

325
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
About three weeks ago.

326
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,640
It was a surprise.

327
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,200
Mrs Lansquenet hadn't expected him.

328
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,400
It upset her.

329
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,400
She said something like "Poor Richard.

330
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,880
He sounds senile.

331
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,760
All these silly ideas that 
someone is poisoning him.

332
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,920
Old people get like that." And 
of course, that is only too true.

333
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:04,080
When my aunt got old, she thought the 
servants were trying to poison her!'

334
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
Mr Entwhistle was very worried.

335
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,560
Richard Abernethie had not been senile.

336
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:19,080
He asked whether Miss Gilchrist knew 
if Cora Lansquenet had left a will.

337
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,000
She replied that Mrs Lansquenet's 
will was at the bank.

338
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,200
With that he left.

339
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,040
He insisted on Miss Gilchrist accepting some  

340
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:37,240
money for her expenses and told 
her he would contact her again.

341
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,680
In the meantime he would be 
grateful if she would stay  

342
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,160
on at the cottage while she looked for a new job.

343
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Mr Entwhistle then left to talk 
to the bank manager and to have  

344
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,840
a further conversation with 
Inspector Morton.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

345
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
CHAPTER FIVE

346
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,040
That evening, the phone rang and Mr 
Entwhistle heard Maude Abernethie's voice.

347
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,600
'Thank goodness you're there!

348
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,480
This news about Cora has upset Timothy 
dreadfully - was it really murder?'

349
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,880
'Yes,' said Mr Entwhistle.

350
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,160
'It seems incredible,' said Maude.

351
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,040
'And I am very worried about Timothy.

352
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,680
It's so bad for him, all this.

353
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,840
He insists that you come up 
here to Yorkshire and see him.

354
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,000
He wants to know if Cora left a will.'

355
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,680
'There is a will.

356
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,520
She left instructions for Timothy to be 
her executor but I will arrange everything.

357
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,360
She left her own paintings and a piece of 
jewellery to her companion, Miss Gilchrist,  

358
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,640
and everything else to her niece, Susan.'

359
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,920
'To Susan? But why Susan?'

360
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:16,280
'Perhaps because she thought Susan had made 
a marriage that the family disapproved of.

361
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,000
When all the bills are paid 
and the furniture is sold,  

362
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,360
I doubt Susan will get more 
than five hundred pounds.

363
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,200
The inquest will be next Thursday.

364
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,880
I will need Timothy's signature on 
certain documents as he is the executor,  

365
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,880
so I think it might be a good 
thing if I did come and see you.'

366
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,800
'That is wonderful!

367
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:53,760
Tomorrow? And you'll stay the night? The 
best train is the 11.20 from St Pancras.'

368
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,840
'I will have to take an 
afternoon train, I'm afraid.

369
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,600
I have other business in the morning.'

370
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:11,920
Mr Entwhistle's 'other business' was 
visiting George, Rosamund and Susan.

371
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:20,720
Mr Entwhistle said, 'I tried to phone you the day 
after the funeral, but you weren't in the office.'

372
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,480
'They never told me,' said George Crossfield.

373
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,680
'I thought I should have a 
day off after the good news!'

374
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,200
'The good news?'

375
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
George's face went red.

376
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,160
'Oh, I didn't mean Uncle Richard's death.

377
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,360
But knowing you've inherited money 
certainly makes you feel lucky,  

378
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,040
so I went to the horse-races at Hurst Park.

379
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,440
And I placed bets on two horses that won.

380
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:01,200
I only made fifty pounds, but 
it all helps pay the bills.'

381
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,000
'Oh yes,' said Mr Entwhistle.

382
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,960
'And there will now be additional money coming 
to you as a result of your Aunt Cora's death.'

383
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,320
'Poor old girl,' George said.

384
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:25,200
'It does seem bad luck, doesn't it? I expect the 
police will question all the strange characters  

385
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,240
in the neighbourhood and make them prove 
where they were when the murder happened.'

386
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,840
'Not so easy if a little time 
has passed,' said Mr Entwhistle.

387
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,680
'I was in a bookshop at 
half past three on that day.

388
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,440
But would I remember that if I was 
questioned in ten days' time? Would  

389
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,600
you remember which day you went to 
the races in - say - a month's time?'

390
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:02,040
'Oh, I would remember because it 
was the day after the funeral.'

391
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,320
'True - true.

392
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,120
And then you bet on two winning horses.

393
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,800
You wouldn't forget that!

394
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,720
Which were they, by the way?'

395
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,760
'Gaymarck and Frogg II.

396
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,040
Yes, I won't forget them in a hurry.'

397
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,520
Mr Entwhistle gave a small laugh and left.

398
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,600
'It's lovely to see you,' said Rosamund, 
'but it's very early in the morning.'

399
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,440
'It's eleven o'clock!' said Mr Entwhistle.

400
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,320
Michael Shane appeared, yawning.

401
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,160
The lawyer did not approve of 
the young Shanes' way of living.

402
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:59,680
He disliked the bottles and glasses that lay about 
the sitting room and the untidiness of it all.

403
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,040
But Rosamund and Michael were certainly  

404
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,600
a very handsome couple and they 
seemed very fond of each other.

405
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,880
Mr Entwhistle said, 'I have just 
come back from Lytchett St Mary.'

406
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,280
'Then it was Aunt Cora who 
was murdered?' Rosamund said.

407
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,480
'We saw it in the newspaper.

408
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,080
And I said it must be.

409
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,400
Two murders, one after another!'

410
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,440
'Don't be silly, Rosamund,' said Michael.

411
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,360
'Your Uncle Richard wasn't murdered.'

412
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,840
'Well, Cora thought he was.'

413
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,760
Mr Entwhistle interrupted.

414
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,720
'You did come back to London after the 
funeral, didn't you? I ask because I phoned  

415
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,840
you the following day - several times 
in fact, and couldn't get an answer.'

416
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,040
'Oh dear.

417
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,120
We were here until about twelve, and 
then Michael went to lunch with someone.

418
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:12,440
I had a lovely afternoon shopping - and 
then we had dinner at a Spanish restaurant.

419
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,160
We got back here about ten 
o'clock that night, I suppose.'

420
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,120
Michael was looking thoughtfully at Mr Entwhistle.

421
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,840
'What did you want to ask us, Sir?'

422
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,600
'Oh!

423
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:34,240
Just some things about Richard 
Abernethie's estate.' Rosamund asked,  

424
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,080
'Do we get the money now, or not for a long time?'

425
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,400
'I'm afraid,' said Mr Entwhistle, 
'that the law is full of delays.'

426
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,080
'But we can get some money in advance, 
can't we?' Rosamund looked worried.

427
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,800
'It's very important.

428
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
Because of the play.'

429
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,560
Michael said pleasantly, 
'Oh, there's no real hurry.

430
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,080
It's just a question of deciding 
whether to finance the play or not.'

431
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:15,400
'It will be very easy to advance 
you some money,' said Mr Entwhistle.

432
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,480
'Then that's all right.' 
Rosamund gave a sigh of relief.

433
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,800
'Did Aunt Cora leave any money?'

434
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,040
'A little.

435
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,320
She left it to your cousin Susan.'

436
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,320
'Why Susan? Is it much?'

437
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,080
'A few hundred pounds and some furniture.'

438
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,400
'Nice furniture?'

439
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,800
'No,' said Mr Entwhistle.

440
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,520
Rosamund lost interest.

441
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,720
'It's all very strange, isn't it?' she said.

442
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:57,400
'There was Cora, after the funeral, suddenly 
saying, "He was murdered!" and then, the  

443
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:06,360
very next day, she is murdered? 
I mean, it is strange, isn't it?'

444
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:19,320
Mr Entwhistle said quietly, 
'Yes, it is very strange.'

445
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,280
Mr Entwhistle studied Susan Banks as she talked.

446
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,920
In many ways she reminded him of 
her uncle, Richard Abernethie.

447
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,240
She had the same energy he had.

448
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,800
And yet Richard Abernethie had 
left her no more than the others.

449
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
The reason must be because 
he didn't like her husband.

450
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,840
Mr Entwhistle looked at Gregory Banks, a 
thin, pale young man with reddish hair.

451
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:59,640
He was quite pleasant, and yet there was something 
about him that made Mr Entwhistle uneasy.

452
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:07,920
What had attracted Susan to him? It was obvious 
that her world revolved around her husband.

453
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,160
'Have they any idea at all who the 
murderer might be?' Susan asked.

454
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,760
'They wouldn't tell me if they did 
- and the murder took place only  

455
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,200
the day before yesterday,' said Mr Entwhistle.

456
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:31,600
'It's definitely got to be a certain 
kind of person,' Susan was thoughtful.

457
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:38,320
'Someone violent, perhaps insane - 
I mean, to use a hatchet like that.

458
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:45,360
But thinking of possible motives - did 
Cora leave her companion anything?'

459
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:50,520
'A small piece of jewellery of no 
great value and some watercolours  

460
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,280
of fishing villages of sentimental value only.'

461
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,400
'Well, no motive there - unless one is insane.'

462
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,000
Mr Entwhistle gave a little laugh.

463
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,480
'As far as I can see, the only person 
who had a motive is you, my dear Susan.'

464
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,800
'What's that?' An ugly 
light showed in Greg's eyes.

465
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,560
'How is Sue involved? What do you 
mean - saying things like that?'

466
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,320
'Just my little joke,' said 
Mr Entwhistle apologetically.

467
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,520
'Cora left her estate to you, Susan.

468
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:42,760
But nobody can suggest than an estate of a few 
hundred pounds at the most is a motive for murder,  

469
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:51,680
for a young lady who has just inherited several 
hundred thousand pounds from her uncle.'

470
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,040
'She left her estate to me?' 
Susan sounded surprised.

471
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,560
'How extraordinary.

472
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,840
She didn't even know me!'

473
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:10,800
'I think she had heard rumours that there had been 
a little difficulty - er - over your marriage.

474
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,160
There had been a certain amount of trouble  

475
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,160
over her own marriage - and I 
think she felt you were alike.'

476
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,640
'She married an artist, didn't 
she? Was he a good artist?'

477
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
Mr Entwhistle shook his head.

478
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,280
Are there any of his paintings in the cottage?'

479
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,840
'Yes.'

480
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,200
'Then I shall judge for myself,' said Susan.

481
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,880
'Is there anybody at the cottage now?'

482
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,440
'I have arranged for Miss Gilchrist 
to stay there,' Mr Entwhistle said.

483
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,560
'Your aunt made your Uncle Timothy her executor,  

484
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,040
so I will tell him of your 
decision to go down to the cottage.

485
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,680
And what are your plans for the future?'

486
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,960
'I've got my eve on a building in Cardigan 
Street where I want to open a beauty salon.

487
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,040
I suppose you can advance me some 
money? I may have to pay a deposit.'

488
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,680
'I can arrange that,' said Mr Entwhistle.

489
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,480
'I telephoned you the day after the funeral 
several times - but could get no answer.

490
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,840
I thought perhaps you might like an advance.

491
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,680
I wondered whether you might 
have gone out of town.'

492
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,840
'Oh no,' said Susan quickly.

493
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,560
'We were in all day.'

494
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,600
Greg said gently, 'You know Susan, I think 
our telephone wasn't working that day.

495
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,120
I couldn't get through to someone 
I telephoned in the afternoon.

496
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,560
I meant to report it, but it 
was all right the next morning.'

497
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:05,440
'Telephones,' said Mr Entwhistle, 
'can be very unreliable sometimes.'

498
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,960
Susan said suddenly, 'How did Aunt 
Cora know about our marriage?'

499
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,040
'Richard may have told her.

500
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:23,080
She changed her will about three weeks ago - 
just about the time he had been to see her.'

501
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,800
Susan looked surprised.

502
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,000
'Did Uncle Richard go to see her? I'd no idea!

503
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,520
So that was when...'

504
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,000
'When what?'

505
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,200
'Nothing,' said Susan.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

506
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,560
CHAPTER SIX

507
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,280
'It's very good of you to 
come,' said Maude Abernethie,  

508
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,600
as she led Mr Entwhistle to a very old car.

509
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,400
'I'm sorry about this old thing.

510
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,840
In fact, it broke down when I was 
coming back after the funeral.

511
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,680
I had to walk a couple of miles to the nearest  

512
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:10,960
garage and stay at a small hotel while 
they fixed it and that upset Timothy.

513
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,840
I try to keep things from him as much 
as possible - but some things I can't  

514
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,440
do anything about - Cora's murder, for instance.

515
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,720
I had to ask Dr Barton to give 
him something to calm him down.

516
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:37,280
It seems so strange for someone to break in 
and murder her in the middle of the afternoon.

517
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,480
If you broke into a house, surely you'd 
do it at night - and there must have been  

518
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:51,720
times during the day when both Cora and her 
companion were out and the house was empty.

519
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:59,520
It doesn't make sense to commit a murder 
unless it's absolutely necessary.'

520
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:11,920
Does murder ever make sense? It depended, Mr 
Entwhistle thought, on the mind of the murderer.

521
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,440
They arrived at a very large 
house which badly needed painting.

522
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,520
'We have no servants,' said Maude 
slightly angrily as she led the way in.

523
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,200
'Just a couple of women who come in every morning.

524
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:36,120
If I have to go out in the afternoon, 
Timothy is completely alone.'

525
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,560
Maude led the way into the sitting room where 
she had already put tea things by the fireplace,  

526
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,680
and seating Mr Entwhistle there, disappeared.

527
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:54,680
She returned in a few minutes' 
with a teapot and homemade cake.

528
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:01,840
Looking at Maude in the light of the 
fire, Mr Entwhistle suddenly felt sad.

529
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:09,880
Maude Abernethie had not had any children 
but she was a woman built for motherhood.

530
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:18,120
Her hypochondriac husband had become her 
child, to be guarded and watched over.

531
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,320
Poor Maude, thought Mr Entwhistle.

532
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,040
'It is good of you to come, Entwhistle.'  

533
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,400
Timothy raised himself up in 
his chair as he held out a hand.

534
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,200
'I mustn't do too much,' he said.

535
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,840
'The doctor's forbidden it.

536
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,120
You'll have to do everything for me, Entwhistle.

537
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:52,800
I can't go to the inquest or be bothered by 
business of any kind connected with Cora's estate.

538
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,640
What happens to Cora's share of Richard's money?  

539
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:07,320
It comes to me, I suppose?' Saying something 
about preparing dinner, Maude left the room.

540
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,400
'The sum left invested for 
Cora,' said Mr Entwhistle,  

541
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,400
'goes equally to you and 
George, Rosamund and Susan.'

542
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,960
'But I'm her only surviving brother!

543
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,840
I couldn't believe it when Maude came 
home and told me about Richard's will.

544
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,600
I thought she'd made a mistake.

545
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:38,800
She is the best woman in the world, 
Maude - but women don't understand money.

546
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,880
I don't believe she even realises that 
if Richard hadn't died when he did,  

547
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,400
we might have had to leave our home here.

548
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,360
That is a fact!'

549
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,920
'Surely if you had asked Richard...'

550
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,840
Timothy gave a short laugh.

551
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:05,720
'I did say once to Richard that this place 
was getting a bit expensive to run and he  

552
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,760
said that we would be much better 
off in a smaller place altogether.

553
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,640
It would be easier for Maude, he said!

554
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,320
Oh no, I wouldn't have asked Richard for help.

555
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:26,560
But I can tell you, Entwhistle, that 
the worry affected my health badly.

556
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,760
Then Richard died and I felt 
so relieved about the future.

557
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,840
But what hurt me was how Richard left his money.

558
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,560
I assumed that he would leave everything to me.

559
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:52,800
He came here - not long after Mortimer's death 
- because he wanted to talk about the family.

560
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,400
We discussed young George - and 
Rosamund and Susan and their husbands.

561
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,760
Both of those girls have made 
bad marriages, if you ask me.

562
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,760
Well, I thought Richard was asking for 
my advice because I would be head of  

563
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:21,080
the family after he died, and so I thought 
the control of the money would be mine.'

564
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,200
In his excitement Timothy had 
kicked aside the blanket that  

565
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,840
covered his legs and sat up straight in his chair.

566
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,000
He looked, Mr Entwhistle 
thought, a perfectly healthy man.

567
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,640
'Will you have a drink, Entwhistle?'

568
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,440
'Not quite so soon.

569
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,760
Maude has just given me an excellent tea.'

570
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
Timothy looked at him.

571
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,800
'She's a capable woman.

572
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,000
Maude.

573
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,320
She even fixes that old car of ours - she's 
a good mechanic in her way, you know.'

574
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,880
'Yes, I hear the car broke down 
coming back from the funeral.

575
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,080
Timothy, I don't know how much Maude told 
you about the funeral and the relatives.

576
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,920
Cora said that Richard had been murdered.

577
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,320
Perhaps Maude told you.'

578
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,600
Timothy laughed.

579
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,440
'That's just the sort of thing Cora would say!'

580
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,240
Maude came into the room and said 
firmly, 'I think, Timothy dear,  

581
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,160
that Mr Entwhistle has been with you long enough.

582
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,920
You really must rest.

583
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,680
If you have arranged everything...'

584
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,240
'Oh, we've arranged things.

585
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,680
I'll leave it all to you, Entwhistle.

586
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:56,160
You'll see to Cora's funeral - won't 
you? We shan't be able to come,  

587
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,520
but send an expensive wreath from us.'

588
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,800
Mr Entwhistle left for London by the 
breakfast train the following morning.

589
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,120
When he got home, he telephoned 
a friend of his.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

590
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,840
CHAPTER SEVEN

591
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,520
'I can't tell you how pleased I 
am that you were able to see me  

592
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:29,160
so soon,' Mr Entwhistle said as Hercule 
Poirot led him to a chair by the fire.

593
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:34,040
On one side of the room a table was laid for two.

594
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,000
Poirot said, 'You are welcome, mon ami.

595
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,280
I returned from the country this morning.

596
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,560
And you have something you 
wish to discuss with me?'

597
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,120
'Yes.

598
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,800
It's a long story, I'm afraid.'

599
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,440
'Then we will not have it 
until after we have eaten.

600
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,880
Georges?'

601
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:07,280
Poirot's manservant, Georges, came in immediately 
with some pate de foie gras and hot toast.

602
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,400
'We will have our pate by the fire,' said Poirot.

603
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,080
'Afterwards we will move to the table...'

604
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:25,080
It was an hour and a half later 
that Mr Entwhistle sighed happily.

605
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,440
'You certainly know how to eat well, Poirot.'

606
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,640
'At my age, the main pleasure, almost 
the only pleasure that still remains,  

607
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:44,360
is the pleasure of the table,' 
the Belgian detective said.

608
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,920
A very good port was now by Mr Entwhistle's side.

609
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,560
Poirot had a sweet liqueur.

610
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,960
'I don't know,' said Mr Entwhistle, 
'whether I'm making a fool of myself.

611
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:07,280
But I'm going to put the facts before you, 
and then I'd like to know what you think.'

612
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,600
He paused for a moment or two, 
then he started speaking again.

613
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,560
He told the story clearly, which 
was appreciated by the little man  

614
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:23,040
with the egg-shaped head who sat listening to him.

615
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,240
When Entwhistle had finished there was a pause.

616
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:34,280
Then Hercule Poirot said at 
last, 'It seems very clear.

617
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,240
You have in your mind the 
suspicion that your friend,  

618
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:45,800
Richard Abernethie may have been murdered? 
A suspicion that you made on the basis of

619
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:55,520
one thing only - the words spoken by Cora 
Lansquenet at Richard Abernethie's funeral.

620
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:02,920
The fact that she herself was murdered 
the day afterwards may be a coincidence.

621
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,240
It is true that Richard Abernethie died suddenly,  

622
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,600
but he was being seen by a 
doctor who had no suspicions.

623
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,200
Was Richard buried or cremated?'

624
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,040
'Cremated - at his own request.'

625
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:30,800
'So we come back to the essential 
point: what Cora Lansquenet said.

626
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:38,600
And the real point is - that you 
believe she was speaking the truth.'

627
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,720
'Yes, I do,' replied Mr Entwhistle

628
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:52,200
'Why? Is it because already you had an uneasiness 
about the way Richard's death happened?'

629
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,720
The lawyer shook his head.

630
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,840
'No, no, it isn't that.'

631
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,400
'Then it is because of her - of Cora herself.

632
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,120
You knew her well?'

633
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,880
'I had not seen her for - oh - over thirty years.'

634
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:22,080
'Would you have known her if you had met her 
in the street? ' Mr Entwhistle thought hard.

635
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,120
'I might have passed her by in the 
street without recognising her.

636
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,520
But the moment I spoke to her face 
to face I would have recognised her.

637
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:39,280
She wore her hair in the same way, and had a 
trick of looking up at you through her fringe,  

638
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:47,720
and she had a way of putting her head on one 
side and then suddenly saying something shocking.

639
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:56,520
She had character, you see and 
character is always highly individual.'

640
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,720
'She was, in fact, the same 
Cora you had known years ago.

641
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:08,520
And she still said shocking things!' said Poirot.

642
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:15,960
'The shocking things she had said in 
the past - were they usually correct?'

643
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,520
'That was always the awkward thing about Cora.

644
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,640
She spoke the truth when it 
would have been better not to.'

645
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,360
'And Cora was quite sure 
Richard had been murdered.

646
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,600
So she must have had some reason for the belief.

647
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,200
Now tell me - when she said

648
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:45,360
what she did, everyone protested 
immediately - that is right? And she  

649
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:54,800
then became confused and said something like 
"But I thought - from what he told me..."'

650
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,040
The lawyer nodded.

651
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,560
'I wish I could remember more clearly.

652
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:07,080
But I'm fairly sure she used the 
words "he told me" or "he said..."'

653
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,960
'And then everyone spoke of something else.

654
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,720
You can remember, looking back,  

655
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:22,000
no special expression on anyone's 
face?' Poirot continued his questioning.

656
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,920
'No.'

657
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,640
'And the very next day, Cora is 
killed - and you ask yourself,  

658
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:36,920
"Was she killed because what she had 
said was true?" Me, I think, mon cher.

659
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:43,040
exactly as you thought - that 
there is a case for investigation.

660
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,080
You have spoken of these matters to the police?'

661
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,960
'No.

662
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,520
I represent the family, Poirot.

663
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:58,440
And if Richard Abernethie was murdered, there 
seems only one way it could have been done.'

664
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,640
'By poison?'

665
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,960
'Exactly.

666
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,480
And the body has been cremated.

667
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,800
There is now no evidence available.

668
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,440
But I, myself, must be sure about it.

669
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,040
That is why, Poirot, I have come to you.'

670
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,240
'Who was in the house at the time of his death?'

671
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:28,840
'Lanscombe - an old butler who has been 
with him for years, a cook and a housemaid.

672
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:33,520
If he was murdered, one of 
them must be the killer.'

673
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,040
'Ah no!

674
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:42,800
This Cora, she knows Richard Abernethie was 
killed, yet she agrees to keeping it quiet.

675
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,240
Therefore it must be one of 
the family who is responsible.

676
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:54,680
But we shall never be able to prove 
anything in the case of Richard Abernethie.

677
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:01,320
However, the murder of Cora 
Lansquenet is different.

678
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:08,480
Once we know "who" then it should be 
possible to get the evidence we need.

679
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:15,040
You have already done something?' Poirot asked.

680
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:18,520
'I hoped that by a few casual questions I could  

681
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:24,360
clear certain members of the family 
from suspicion, perhaps all of them.

682
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,240
In which case, Cora would have been wrong  

683
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,360
and her own death must have been 
done by a criminal who broke in.

684
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,040
After all, it is simple.

685
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,960
What were the members of the Abernethie family  

686
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,540
doing on the afternoon that 
Cora Lansquenet was killed?'

687
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:51,840
'Eh bien.' said Poirot, 'what were they doing?'

688
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:56,040
'George Crossfield was at Hurst Park horse-races.

689
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,120
Rosamund Shane was shopping in London.

690
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,880
Her husband was at lunch discussing a play.

691
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,120
Susan and Gregory Banks were at home all day.

692
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,920
Timothy Abernethie was at his home in Yorkshire,  

693
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,280
and his wife was driving 
herself home from Enderby.'

694
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,880
Hercule Poirot nodded.

695
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,400
'Yes, that is what they say.

696
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,960
And is it all true?'

697
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,160
'I don't know, Poirot.

698
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:34,680
George may have been at Hurst Park 
races, but I do not think he was.

699
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,560
He said that he had bet on a couple of winners.

700
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,680
I asked him the names and 
both horses he named had,  

701
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:49,240
I found, been expected to win - but only one had.'

702
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,280
'Interesting.

703
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:58,880
Had this George any urgent need for 
money at the time of his uncle's death?'

704
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:08,280
'I have no evidence, but I suspect that he has 
been gambling with his clients' money.' He sighed.

705
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:14,240
'As for Rosamund, she is lovely, 
but not very intelligent.

706
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,760
Her husband, Michael Shane, 
is a man with ambition.

707
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,880
But I have no reason to 
suspect him of a violent crime.

708
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:31,320
However, until I know that he really 
was doing what he says he was doing,  

709
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,040
I cannot take him off my list of suspects.'

710
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,520
'You have no doubts about Rosamund, the wife?'

711
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:46,200
'No - no - she is a delicate-looking creature.'

712
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,920
'And beautiful!' said Poirot with a smile.

713
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,120
'And the other niece?'

714
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:59,360
'Susan? She is a girl of huge ability, I think.

715
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,000
She and her husband were 
at home together that day.

716
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,040
I said that I had tried to telephone them on 
the afternoon in question - I hadn't, of course.

717
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:18,200
Greg said very quickly that the 
telephone had not been working all day.'

718
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,120
'So again there is no evidence...

719
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,760
What is the husband like?'

720
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,280
'He does not have a pleasing personality, 
though I cannot say exactly why.

721
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,320
Susan has the mental strength and 
intelligence of Richard Abernethie.

722
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:46,440
But I feel that she lacks the 
kindness and warmth of my old friend.'

723
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,240
'Women are never kind,' remarked Poirot.

724
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,640
'Though they can sometimes be gentle.

725
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,360
Does she love her husband?'

726
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,400
'She loves him almost too much, I would say.'

727
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,080
'Me, I am not so sentimental 
about beautiful young ladies!

728
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:19,920
Now tell me about your visit to the 
older members of the Abernethie family.'

729
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,560
Mr Entwhistle described his visit to 
Timothy and Maude and Poirot nodded.

730
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:32,920
'So Mrs Maude Abernethie is a good car mechanic.

731
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:39,880
And Mr Timothy Abernethie is not the 
sick man he likes to think himself.

732
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,760
He also resented his brother's success.

733
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,000
What about the sixth beneficiary?'

734
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,120
'Helen? I do not suspect her for a moment.

735
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,320
Anyway, she was at Enderby.

736
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,870
With three servants in the house.'

737
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:03,320
'Eh bien, my friend,' said Poirot.

738
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,320
'What do you want me to do?'

739
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,200
'I want to know the truth, Poirot.

740
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:16,160
I know you don't take cases any 
more, but I ask you to take this one.

741
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,720
And I will be responsible for your fees.

742
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,080
Come now, money is always useful.'

743
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,400
Poirot smiled.

744
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,160
'Not if it all goes in the taxes!

745
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,320
But I will admit, your problem interests me!

746
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,280
Because it is not easy...

747
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,160
But I think it will be best if you yourself talk  

748
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,360
to the doctor who was looking 
after Mr Richard Abernethie.

749
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,800
He will speak more freely to you than to me.

750
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,640
Ask him about Mr Abernethie's illness.

751
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:05,480
Find out what medicines Mr Abernethie was 
taking at the time of his death and even before.

752
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:12,560
Find out if he ever said anything 
to his doctor about being poisoned.

753
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:23,240
By the way, this Miss Gilchrist is sure that he 
used the term poisoned in talking to his sister?'

754
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,440
Mr Entwhistle thought for a moment.

755
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,400
'It was the word she used - but she is 
the sort of witness who might change  

756
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,680
the actual words used, thinking that 
complete accuracy isn't important.

757
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,880
I can talk to her again.'

758
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,720
'Yes.

759
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,840
Or I will do so.'

760
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,440
Poirot now said in a different voice,  

761
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:55,440
'Has it occurred to you that your Miss 
Gilchrist may be in some danger herself?

762
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,040
Cora spoke her suspicions 
on the day of the funeral.

763
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,960
The question in the murderer's mind will be,  

764
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,240
did Cora tell them to anybody when 
she first heard of Richard's death?

765
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:19,400
And the most likely person for her to have 
spoken to about them would be Miss Gilchrist.

766
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:25,360
I think, mon cher, that she should not 
be alone in that cottage!'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

767
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,520
CHAPTER EIGHT

768
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,480
Dr Larraby, when questioned 
by Mr Entwhistle about the  

769
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:41,680
possibility of Richard Abernethie 
being poisoned, denied it at once.

770
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:46,720
'Entwhistle, who is making this suggestion?'

771
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,120
'Abernethie never even suggested that one of  

772
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,320
his relations wanted him out of 
the way?' Mr Entwhistle asked.

773
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,440
'No!'

774
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:06,280
Mr Entwhistle told him of Cora's comment 
at the funeral and Dr Larraby smiled.

775
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:11,200
'My dear fellow, the 
explanation for that is simple.

776
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:20,360
The woman is at a certain time of life - 
searching for excitement, unbalanced, unreliable.

777
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,560
She might say anything.

778
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,320
They do, you know!'

779
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,600
'You may be right,' Mr 
Entwhistle said, standing up.

780
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:37,280
'Unfortunately we can't ask her 
as she's been murdered herself.'

781
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,280
'What?'

782
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,680
'You've probably read about it in the paper.

783
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:48,680
Mrs Lansquenet at Lytchett St Mary in Berkshire.'

784
01:10:48,680 --> 01:11:00,600
'I had no idea she was a relation of Richard 
Abernethie's!' Dr Larraby was looking worried now.

785
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:07,920
Back at Enderby, Mr Entwhistle asked 
the old butler what his plans were.

786
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:18,560
'Mrs Helen Abernethie has asked me to stay 
on until the house is sold, Sir.' He sighed.

787
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:26,520
'I appreciate Mr Richard's generosity to 
me in his will, and though my married niece  

788
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:36,240
has asked me to go and live with them, well, 
it won't be the same as living at Enderby.'

789
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,200
'I know,' said Mr Entwhistle.

790
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,600
'It's a hard new world for us old men.

791
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,600
I wish I had seen more of my 
old friend before he died.

792
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,320
How did he seem those last few months?'

793
01:11:53,320 --> 01:12:01,240
'Well, he wasn't himself, Sir, 
not since Mr Mortimer's death.'

794
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,480
'No.

795
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:09,400
And he was a sick man - sick men 
have strange ideas sometimes.

796
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,640
I imagine Mr Abernethie did, too.

797
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:21,920
Did he speak of enemies sometimes, of 
somebody wishing to hurt him - perhaps?  

798
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:27,640
He might even have thought 
his food was being poisoned?'

799
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,000
Old Lanscombe looked surprised.

800
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,880
'I don't remember anything of that kind, Sir.'

801
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:45,160
'He invited some of his family to stay with him, 
didn't he, before he died? His nephew and his two  

802
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:54,840
nieces and their husbands? Was he satisfied 
with those visits? Or was he disappointed?

803
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Lanscombe's eyes became cold.

804
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,600
'I really could not say, Sir.'

805
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,280
'I think you could,' said Mr Entwhistle gently.

806
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,640
'I liked your Master very much and so did you.

807
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:18,640
That's why I'm asking you for your 
opinion as a man, not as a butler.

808
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,560
Did you feel that something was - wrong?'

809
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,600
'Only since the funeral, Sir.

810
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,760
And I couldn't say exactly what it is.'

811
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,920
'You know the contents of the will?'

812
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,280
'Yes, Sir.

813
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,880
Mrs Helen thought I would like to know.

814
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,800
It seemed to me a very fair will.'

815
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,440
'Yes, but it is not, I think,  

816
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:54,760
the will that Mr Abernethie originally 
intended to make after his son died.'

817
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:01,800
'The Master, Sir, was very disappointed 
after Mr George had been here...

818
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:09,840
Miss Susan he liked at once, but 
he didn't like her husband at all.'

819
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,600
'And the other couple?'

820
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:21,720
'I think the Master enjoyed having them here 
- but he never approved of acting as a job.

821
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:27,360
He said to me one day, "It's a silly kind of life.

822
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,600
It seems to me that actors and actresses 
live in a world of make-believe.

823
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,160
I'm not sure it helps their 
judgment of what is right  

824
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:46,280
and what is wrong." Of course 
he wasn't speaking directly.'

825
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,800
'No, no, I understand.

826
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:56,040
Now after these visits, Mr Abernethie 
himself went away - first to his brother,  

827
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,800
and afterwards to Mrs Lansquenet.

828
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:06,800
Can you remember anything he said 
about those visits on his return?'

829
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,600
'The Master used to talk quietly to himself  

830
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:16,320
sometimes - thinking aloud 
- when I was in the room.

831
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,400
He said something about not understanding  

832
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,960
what had happened to the money 
their father had left Timothy.

833
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:35,760
And then he said something like, "Women can be 
fools in ninety-nine different ways but not in  

834
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:45,680
the hundredth." And "You can only say what you 
really think to someone of your own generation.

835
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:54,920
They don't think you're imagining things 
as the younger ones do." And later he said  

836
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:06,920
"It's not very pleasant to have to set traps for 
people, but I don't see what else I can do.'"

837
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:11,840
Richard Abernethie had spoken of setting a trap.

838
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,360
For whom?

839
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:23,080
Mr Entwhistle decided he should 
take Helen into his confidence.

840
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:29,600
'I am going to ask you if you could stay 
here until the house is sold,' he said,  

841
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:35,480
'but there is another reason why I 
would be grateful if you would stay on.

842
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:41,160
There is a friend of mine, a 
man called Hercule Poirot-'

843
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:46,000
Helen said sharply, 'Hercule Poirot?'

844
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,320
'You know of him?'

845
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,640
'Yes.' Her face was white.

846
01:16:51,640 --> 01:17:00,480
'You think - that Cora was right? 
That Richard was - murdered?'

847
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,160
Mr Entwhistle told her everything.

848
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:09,080
When he had finished she said, 'Maude and I,  

849
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:15,120
that night after the funeral - it 
was in both our minds, I'm sure.

850
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:24,600
And then - Cora was killed - and I told 
myself it was just coincidence - but oh!

851
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,240
If I could only be sure.

852
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,200
I've been uneasy...

853
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:35,400
Not just about what Cora said 
that day - something else.

854
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,040
Something that I felt at the time to be wrong.'

855
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,080
'Wrong? In what way?'

856
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,560
'That's just it.

857
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,760
I don't know.'

858
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,680
'You mean it was something about 
one of the people in the room?'

859
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,840
'Yes - yes - something of that kind.

860
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,880
But I can't remember what it was.

861
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,120
The more I think...'

862
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,640
'Don't think.

863
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,240
That is the wrong way to 
try to remember something.

864
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,880
Let it go.

865
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,440
Sooner or later it will come into your mind.

866
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:18,400
And when it does - let me know - at once.'

867
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,520
'I will.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

868
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,080
CHAPTER NINE

869
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:30,840
The front-door bell rang and for some 
reason Miss Gilchrist felt nervous.

870
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:37,440
She went unwillingly to the door, 
telling herself not to be so silly.

871
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:45,360
A young woman dressed in black and carrying a 
small suitcase was standing on the step outside.

872
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:51,320
She noticed the nervous look on Miss 
Gilchrist's face and said quickly,  

873
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:57,600
'Miss Gilchrist? I am Mrs 
Lansquenet's niece - Susan Banks.'

874
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,160
'Oh dear, yes, of course.

875
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,000
Do come in, Mrs Banks.

876
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,600
I didn't know you were 
coming down for the inquest.

877
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,240
I would have had something ready - coffee or tea.'

878
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,600
Susan Banks said quickly, 'I don't want anything.

879
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,120
I'm so sorry if I frightened you.'

880
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,840
'Well, I'm not usually nervous,  

881
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:30,520
but - perhaps it's just the inquest - 
I have been nervous all this morning.

882
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,760
Half an hour ago the bell rang and 
I was almost too afraid to open the  

883
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:42,400
door - which was really very stupid 
as it is so unlikely that a murderer  

884
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:49,400
would come back - and it was only 
a nun, collecting for an orphanage.

885
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,760
Did you come here by train?'

886
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,640
'No, I came by car.

887
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,160
I thought the road was too narrow 
to park outside so I drove the car  

888
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:07,840
on a little way past the cottage and 
found an old quarry and parked there.'

889
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,400
Susan Banks looked round the 
sitting room with interest.

890
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,720
'Poor Aunt Cora.

891
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,160
She left what she had to me, you know.'

892
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,720
'Yes, I know.

893
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,440
I expect you'll need the furniture.

894
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,520
You're newly married, I understand.'

895
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,120
'I don't want any of it,' Susan said.

896
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,840
'I will sell it.

897
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:41,240
Unless - is there any of it you would like? I'd be 
very happy...' She stopped, a little embarrassed.

898
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,800
But Miss Gilchrist gave a big smile.

899
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,160
'Now that's very kind of you, 
Mrs Banks - but I put my own

900
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:54,760
things in store in case - 
some day - I would need them.

901
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,280
I had a small tearoom at one time, 
you know - then the war came ...

902
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:09,360
But I didn't sell everything, because I did 
hope to have my own little home again one day,  

903
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,920
so I put the best things in 
store with my father's pictures.

904
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:23,760
But I would like very much, if you really wouldn't 
mind, to have that little painted tea table.

905
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:30,280
Such a pretty thing and we always had tea on it.'

906
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:37,760
Susan, looking at what she thought was an ugly 
green table painted with large purple flowers,  

907
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,360
said that she would be delighted 
for Miss Gilchrist to have it.

908
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:46,000
'Thank you very much, Mrs Banks.

909
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,480
I imagine you would like to look 
through her things? After the inquest,  

910
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,520
perhaps?' Miss Gilchrist asked.

911
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:01,120
'I thought I'd stay here a couple 
of days and clear everything up.'

912
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:04,400
'Sleep here, you mean?'

913
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,320
'Yes.

914
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,800
Is there any difficulty?'

915
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:16,160
'Oh no, I'll put fresh sheets on my bed, 
and I can sleep down here on the couch.'

916
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:21,440
'But there's Aunt Cora's room, 
isn't there? I can sleep in that.'

917
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,520
'You - you wouldn't mind?'

918
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,880
'You mean because she was murdered there? Oh no.

919
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,400
I'm very practical, Miss Gilchrist.

920
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:35,880
It's been - I mean - it's been cleaned?'

921
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,320
'Oh yes, Mrs Banks.

922
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:46,040
All the blankets were sent away to the laundry 
and the whole room was cleaned thoroughly.'

923
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:49,080
She led the way upstairs.

924
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:58,120
The room where Cora Lansquenet had died was 
clean and fresh and had no sinister atmosphere.

925
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:05,520
Over the fireplace an oil painting showed 
a young woman about to enter her bath.

926
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:11,640
Susan gave a slight shudder as she 
looked at it and Miss Gilchrist said,  

927
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,840
'That was painted by Mrs Lansquenet's husband.

928
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,840
There are a lot more of his 
pictures in the dining room.'

929
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,880
'How terrible!

930
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,440
Where are Aunt Cora's own pictures?'

931
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,880
'In my room.

932
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,480
Would you like to see them?'

933
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,240
Miss Gilchrist proudly showed her the paintings.

934
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:41,800
Susan commented that it looked like Aunt 
Cora was very fond of villages by the sea  

935
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:48,160
and that perhaps her paintings, which were 
very detailed and very brightly coloured,  

936
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,600
might have been painted from picture postcards.

937
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,440
But Miss Gilchrist was indignant.

938
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:01,000
Mrs Lansquenet always painted from nature!

939
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,880
'Mrs Lansquenet was a real artist,' 
said Miss Gilchrist sharply.

940
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:16,000
She looked at her watch and Susan said quickly, 
'Yes, we ought to leave for the inquest.

941
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,280
Is it far? Shall I get the car?'

942
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:28,080
It was only five minutes' walk, Miss 
Gilchrist said, so they left together on foot.

943
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:37,280
Mr Entwhistle, who had travelled by 
train, met them at the Village Hall.

944
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:42,160
At the inquest, the dead woman was identified.

945
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:48,800
It was said that death was unlikely to 
have occurred later than four-thirty.

946
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,120
Miss Gilchrist testified to finding the body.

947
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:58,120
A police constable and Inspector Morton 
gave their evidence and the jury was  

948
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:07,760
quick to reach the verdict: Murder 
by some person or persons unknown.

949
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:16,120
Afterwards, when they came out again into the 
sunlight, half a dozen newspaper cameras clicked.

950
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:22,760
Mr Entwhistle took them into the King's 
Arms pub for lunch in a private room.

951
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:29,320
He said to Susan, 'I had no idea 
you were coming down today, Susan.

952
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,760
We could have come together.

953
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,400
Did your husband come with you?'

954
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,320
'Greg had some important things to do.

955
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:43,920
We've got great plans for the future 
- we are going to open a beauty salon,  

956
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:51,880
which I will run, and a laboratory 
where Greg can make face creams.'

957
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,320
Mr Entwhistle's mind went to other things.

958
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:03,160
When Susan had spoken to him twice 
without his answering, he apologized.

959
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:08,440
'Forgive me, my dear, I was 
thinking about your Uncle Timothy.

960
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,360
I am a little worried.'

961
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,840
'I wouldn't worry.

962
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,960
Uncle Timothy is not ill at all 
- he's just a hypochondriac.'

963
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,960
'It is not his health that is worrying me.

964
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,800
It's Maude's.

965
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,600
Apparently she has fallen 
downstairs and broken her ankle.

966
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:34,200
She's got to stay in bed and 
your uncle is terribly worried.'

967
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,760
'Because he'll have to look after her instead of  

968
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:43,640
the other way around? It will do 
him a lot of good,' said Susan.

969
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:51,200
'Yes - yes, but will your poor 
aunt get any looking after?'

970
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,680
They came out of the King's Arms, rather warily  

971
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:00,200
but the newspaper reporters 
and photographers had gone.

972
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,960
Mr Entwhistle took them back to the cottage then  

973
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,360
returned to the King's Arms 
where he had booked a room.

974
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,800
The funeral was to be on the following day.

975
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:20,160
'My car's still in the quarry,' said Susan 
when she and Miss Gilchrist had gone inside.

976
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:24,120
'I'll go and get it and drive 
it along to the village later.'

977
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:33,520
Miss Gilchrist said anxiously, 'You 
will do that in daylight, won't you?'

978
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,480
Susan laughed.

979
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:40,000
'You don't think the murderer 
is still nearby, do you?'

980
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,480
'No - no, I suppose not.' Miss 
Gilchrist looked embarrassed.

981
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,840
But it's exactly what she 
does think, thought Susan.

982
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:56,200
Miss Gilchrist went towards the kitchen.

983
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:01,160
'I'm sure you'd like tea, Mrs Banks!'

984
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:04,400
Susan went into the sitting room.

985
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,240
She had only been there a few 
minutes when the doorbell rang.

986
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:13,000
Susan went to the front door and opened it.

987
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,800
An elderly gentleman said, smiling, 
'My name is Alexander Guthrie.

988
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:24,240
I was a very old friend of Cora Lansquenet's.

989
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,000
May I ask who you are?'

990
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,160
'I am Susan Abernethie - well, 
Banks now since I married.

991
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,000
Cora was my aunt.

992
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,640
Please come in.'

993
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:44,520
'Thank you.' Mr Guthrie followed 
Susan into the sitting room.

994
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:49,800
'This is a sad occasion,' said Mr Guthrie.

995
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,640
'Yes, a very sad occasion.

996
01:28:53,640 --> 01:29:00,800
I felt the least I could do was to attend 
the inquest - and of course the funeral.

997
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,400
I usually visited Cora once a 
year, and recently she had been  

998
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:13,480
buying pictures at local sales, and 
wanted me to look at some of them.

999
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,040
I am an art critic, you know.

1000
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:22,160
Of course most of the paintings 
Cora bought were terrible;  

1001
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,960
last year she wanted me to come and 
look at a Rembrandt she had bought.

1002
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,800
A Rembrandt!

1003
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,760
It wasn't even a good copy of one!'

1004
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:41,080
'Like that one over there, I expect,' said 
Susan, pointing to the wall behind him.

1005
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:46,000
Mr Guthrie got up and went 
over to study the picture.

1006
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,480
'Poor dear Cora.

1007
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:54,120
Dirt,' he said, 'is a wonderful thing, Mrs Banks!

1008
01:29:54,120 --> 01:30:01,000
It gives a sort of romance to 
the most terrible paintings.'

1009
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,200
'There are some more pictures 
in the dining room,' said Susan,  

1010
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:09,320
'but I think they are all her husband's work.'

1011
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,240
Mr Guthrie held up a hand.

1012
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,280
'Do not make me look at those again.

1013
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:20,120
I always tried not to hurt Cora's feelings.

1014
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,960
A loving wife - a very loving wife.

1015
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:31,560
Well, dear Mrs Banks, I must 
not take up more of your time.'

1016
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,720
'Oh, do stay and have some tea.

1017
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,320
I think it's nearly ready.'

1018
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:41,600
'That is very kind of you.' 
Mr Guthrie sat down again.

1019
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,760
'I'll just go and see.'

1020
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:52,240
In the kitchen, Miss Gilchrist 
was lifting a tray from the oven.

1021
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,840
'There's a Mr Guthrie here,' Susan said.

1022
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,960
'I've asked him to stay for tea.'

1023
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:05,960
'Mr Guthrie? Oh, yes, he was a great 
friend of dear Mrs Lansquenet's.

1024
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:14,520
How lucky; I've made scones and 
there's some homemade strawberry jam.'

1025
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,680
Susan took in the tray and Miss Gilchrist,  

1026
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:23,040
following with teapot and 
kettle, greeted Mr Guthrie.

1027
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:28,840
'Hot scones, how lovely,' said Mr Guthrie.

1028
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,320
Miss Gilchrist was delighted.

1029
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,080
The scones were excellent.

1030
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:40,120
The memory of the Willow Tree tearoom 
seemed to be in the room with them.

1031
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:45,720
Miss Gilchrist was clearly doing 
what she had been born to do.

1032
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:50,400
'I do feel rather guilty,' said Mr Guthrie,  

1033
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:59,320
'enjoying my tea here, where poor 
Cora was so horribly murdered.'

1034
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,720
Miss Gilchrist shook her head.

1035
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,600
'No, no.

1036
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,280
Mrs Lansquenet would have 
wanted you to have a good tea.'

1037
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,520
'Perhaps you are right.

1038
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,080
The fact is that it's difficult 
for me to accept that someone I  

1039
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:22,320
knew - actually knew - has been murdered!

1040
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:29,240
And certainly not by some casual 
thief who broke in and attacked her.

1041
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:36,160
I can imagine, you know, reasons 
why Cora might have been murdered -'

1042
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:41,480
Susan said quickly, 'Can you? What reasons?'

1043
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:46,760
'Well, if she knew a secret, she 
would always want to talk about it.

1044
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:50,520
Even if she promised not 
to, she would still do it.

1045
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,120
She couldn't stop herself.

1046
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:59,080
So a little poison in a cup of tea 
- that would not have surprised me.

1047
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:06,560
And I would have thought she had very little 
to take that would be worth it for a burglar.

1048
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,400
Ah!

1049
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,720
Well, there's a lot of crime about since the war.

1050
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:19,360
Times have changed.' Thanking 
them for the tea, he said goodbye.

1051
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:26,280
Miss Gilchrist took him to the door and came back 
into the room with a small parcel in her hand.

1052
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,080
'The postman must have been 
while we were at the inquest.

1053
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:37,360
He must have pushed this through the letterbox 
and it fell in the corner behind the door.'

1054
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,800
Happily Miss Gilchrist tore off the paper.

1055
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:47,360
Inside was a small white 
box tied with silver ribbon.

1056
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,840
'It's wedding cake!' She pulled off the ribbon.

1057
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:58,480
Inside was a slice of rich 
fruitcake with white icing.

1058
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:00,160
'How nice!

1059
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,280
Now who -' She read the card attached.

1060
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,440
'John and Mary.

1061
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:14,440
Now who can that be? How silly to put no surname.

1062
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:23,200
It might be my old friend Dorothy's daughter - but 
I haven't heard of an engagement or a marriage.

1063
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:30,360
Then there's the Enfield girl 
- no, her name was Margaret.

1064
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,640
No address or anything.

1065
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:38,760
Oh well, I suppose I'll 
remember soon...'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1066
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,120
CHAPTER TEN

1067
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:45,720
Susan drove her car to the King's 
Arms' car park where she left it  

1068
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:50,560
by a chauffeur-driven Daimler 
which was preparing to go out.

1069
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:57,160
Inside it was an elderly foreign 
gentleman with a large moustache.

1070
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:04,240
After supper, Susan questioned Miss 
Gilchrist about her uncle's visit to Cora.

1071
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,000
'Did they get on well together?'

1072
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,600
'Oh, yes.

1073
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:15,720
She did say that he had got very 
old - I think she said senile...'

1074
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:19,320
'But you didn't think he was senile?'

1075
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,760
'Well, not to look at.

1076
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:27,680
But I didn't talk to him much, 
I left them alone together.'

1077
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:36,600
Was Miss Gilchrist the kind of woman who listened 
at doors? She was honest, Susan felt sure, but...

1078
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,560
'You didn't hear any of their 
conversation?' Susan asked.

1079
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:48,760
'Sometimes, in these small cottages, you can't 
avoid overhearing, and now that they are dead,  

1080
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:53,640
it's really important to the family to 
know what was said at that meeting.'

1081
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,640
Miss Gilchrist nodded.

1082
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:08,040
'I think they were talking about Mr Abernethie's 
health - and certain - well, ideas, he had.

1083
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:11,880
He blamed his ill-health on other people.

1084
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,280
A common thing, I believe, in the old.

1085
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,800
My aunt...'

1086
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,880
'Yes,' Susan interrupted, 'my uncle's 
servants were upset by his thinking...

1087
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:31,040
It was the servants he suspected, I 
suppose? Of poisoning him, I mean?'

1088
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,560
'I don't know.

1089
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:39,920
I - really don't know.' But 
she looked away from Susan,  

1090
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:46,640
so perhaps Miss Gilchrist knew 
more than she was willing to admit.

1091
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:53,760
Susan decided not to say any more on the 
subject until later and asked instead,  

1092
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,680
'What are your own plans for the future?'

1093
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:03,800
'Well, I told Mr Entwhistle I would be 
happy to stay on until everything here  

1094
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:10,320
was cleared up and I wanted to ask 
you how long that was likely to be,  

1095
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:18,600
because, of course, I must start looking 
about for another job as a companion.'

1096
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,400
Susan thought for a moment.

1097
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,920
'There's really not very much to be done here,  

1098
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:30,720
but I wanted to tell you - that I hope 
you'll accept three months' salary.'

1099
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,720
'That's very generous of you, Mrs Banks.

1100
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,200
I do appreciate it.

1101
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:45,080
And you would say that I had been with a relation 
of yours and that I had - proved satisfactory?'

1102
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,360
'Oh, of course.'

1103
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:53,680
'I don't know whether I ought to ask it.' Miss  

1104
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:59,040
Gilchrist's hands began to shake 
and she tried to steady her voice.

1105
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:09,760
'But would it be possible not to - to mention 
what happened here - or even the name?'

1106
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,800
Susan stared.

1107
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,360
'I don't understand.'

1108
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,840
'Because it's murder.

1109
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:21,960
A murder that's been in the papers 
and that everybody has read about.

1110
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:26,520
People might think, "Two women 
living together, and one of them  

1111
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:34,760
is killed - perhaps the companion did it." 
It's been worrying me terribly, Mrs Banks,  

1112
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:41,040
thinking that perhaps I'll never 
get another job - not of this kind.

1113
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:46,960
And what else is there that I can do?'

1114
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,920
Susan suddenly realized the desperation of this  

1115
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:56,360
woman who was dependent on other 
peoples' good opinion to get a job.

1116
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,480
It was true that Miss Gilchrist did not benefit  

1117
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:05,880
from Cora Lansquenet's death 
- but who would know that?

1118
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,960
Susan spoke with her usual confidence.

1119
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,600
'Don't worry,' she said, as Miss Gilchrist 
got up to take their coffee cups into the

1120
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,760
kitchen, 'I'm sure I can find 
you a job amongst my friends.

1121
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,360
There won't be any difficulty.'

1122
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:29,720
And just moments later an idea came to her.

1123
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:33,520
Of course, Susan said to herself.

1124
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,360
That would be perfect!

1125
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:40,160
And she went to the telephone...

1126
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:44,800
Soon afterwards Susan went into the kitchen.

1127
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,280
'I've just been talking to my Uncle Timothy.

1128
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:53,480
Would you like to go to Yorkshire 
and look after my aunt? She fell and  

1129
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:56,320
broke her ankle, as you know.

1130
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:01,560
You could cook and look after Aunt Maude.'

1131
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:06,520
Miss Gilchrist almost dropped 
the coffee pot in her excitement.

1132
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:11,880
'Oh, thank you, thank you - that really is kind.

1133
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,560
I am really good at looking after sick people,  

1134
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:21,720
and I'm sure I can manage your uncle 
and cook him nice little meals.

1135
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:30,440
It's really very kind of you, Mrs Banks, 
and I do appreciate it.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1136
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,320
CHAPTER ELEVEN

1137
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,720
Susan lay in bed, her mind racing.

1138
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:43,520
She had said she did not mind sleeping 
in this bed where Aunt Cora...

1139
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,640
No, no she must not think about that.

1140
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:51,600
Think ahead - her future and Greg's.

1141
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:58,040
The building in Cardigan Street 
- it was just what they wanted.

1142
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:05,240
They could have the beauty salon on the ground 
floor and live in the lovely flat upstairs.

1143
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,240
And there was a room out at the 
back for a laboratory for Greg.

1144
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,240
And Greg would get calm and well again.

1145
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:18,040
There would be no more of those huge angers;  

1146
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:23,240
of those times when he looked at her 
without seeming to know who she was.

1147
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,200
Once or twice she'd been really frightened.

1148
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:35,400
And it would have happened again if Uncle 
Richard hadn't died just when he did.

1149
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:42,320
Uncle Richard had nothing to live for, 
so his death was a good thing, really.

1150
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,160
If only she could sleep.

1151
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:51,960
She always felt so safe in town - 
surrounded by people - never alone.

1152
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,240
Whereas here...

1153
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:02,920
Why did she feel that there was someone 
in this room, someone close beside her?

1154
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:09,640
Surely that was a groan? 
Someone in pain - someone dying!

1155
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:17,440
I mustn't imagine things, I mustn't, 
I mustn't, Susan whispered to herself.

1156
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,240
There it was again...

1157
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,120
someone groaning in great pain.

1158
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,160
This was real!

1159
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:28,320
The groans came from the room next door.

1160
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:33,920
Susan jumped out of bed and 
went into Miss Gilchrist's room.

1161
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,800
She was sitting up in bed, 
her face twisted with pain.

1162
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:45,560
She tried to get out of bed but was very 
sick and then collapsed back on the pillows.

1163
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,040
'Please - ring the doctor.

1164
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,120
I - I must have eaten something...'

1165
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:01,400
As soon as the doctor examined Miss 
Gilchrist, he sent for an ambulance.

1166
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:05,640
'She's really bad then?' asked Susan.

1167
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,680
'Yes.

1168
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,880
I've given her morphia to ease the pain.

1169
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:13,480
But it looks...' He paused.

1170
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,400
'What has she eaten?'

1171
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:23,120
'We had macaroni and cheese for dinner and 
a milk pudding and then coffee afterwards.'

1172
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,600
'Did you have the same things?'

1173
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,920
'Yes.'

1174
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:34,760
'And she's eaten nothing else? 
No tinned fish? Or sausages?'

1175
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,560
'No.'

1176
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,640
The ambulance came and took Miss Gilchrist away.

1177
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:44,480
The doctor went with her.

1178
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:49,120
When he had left, Susan went upstairs to bed.

1179
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:59,440
This time she fell asleep as soon 
as her head touched the pillow.

1180
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:04,320
A large number of people came 
to Cora Lansquenet's funeral.

1181
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:11,400
Most of the villagers were there and wreaths had 
been sent by the other members of the family.

1182
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:17,480
Mr Entwhistle asked where Miss 
Gilchrist was, and Susan explained.

1183
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:20,680
Mr Entwhistle was surprised.

1184
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,440
'Wasn't that strange?'

1185
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,480
'Oh, she's better this morning.

1186
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,640
They called from the hospital.

1187
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:32,280
People do get these stomach upsets.'

1188
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,360
Mr Entwhistle said no more.

1189
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:41,480
He was returning to London 
immediately after the funeral.

1190
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:46,240
Susan went back to the cottage 
and made herself an omelette.

1191
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:53,400
Then she went up to Cora's room and started 
to sort through the dead woman's things.

1192
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:59,400
She was interrupted by the arrival of 
the doctor, who was looking worried.

1193
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:07,680
'Mrs Banks, will you tell me again exactly what 
Miss Gilchrist had to eat and drink yesterday.

1194
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,320
Everything.

1195
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:14,600
There must have been something 
she had and you didn't? '

1196
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,400
'I don't think so...

1197
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,880
scones, jam, tea - and then supper.

1198
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,960
No, I can't remember anything.

1199
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,360
Was it food poisoning?'

1200
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,840
'It was arsenic.' he said.

1201
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:35,320
'Arsenic? You mean somebody gave her arsenic?'

1202
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:38,280
'That's what it looks like.'

1203
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:43,440
'Could the arsenic have got into 
her food or drink by accident?'

1204
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:49,000
'It seems very unlikely, although 
such things have been known.

1205
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,240
But if you and she ate the same things...'

1206
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,600
Susan gave a sudden exclamation.

1207
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,000
'Why, of course, the wedding cake!

1208
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,840
I didn't have any of that, though she offered me  

1209
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:09,120
some.' Susan explained about 
the cake that had arrived.

1210
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,760
'Strange.

1211
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:15,160
And you say she wasn't sure who sent it? Is there  

1212
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:21,320
any of it left? Or is the box it 
came in still here somewhere?'

1213
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,920
'I don't know.'

1214
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:31,040
They found the white box in the kitchen with 
a few very small pieces of cake still in it.

1215
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,680
'I'll take this,' the doctor said.

1216
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:38,640
'Do you have any idea where 
the wrapping paper it came in  

1217
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:45,080
might be?' They looked but they did not find it.

1218
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:52,520
'You won't be leaving here just yet, 
Mrs Banks?' His voice was friendly,  

1219
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:56,720
but it made Susan feel a little uncomfortable.

1220
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:00,720
'No, I will be here for a few days.'

1221
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,920
'Good.

1222
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,800
You understand the police will 
probably want to ask some questions.

1223
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:14,640
You don't know of anyone who - well, 
might have wanted to hurt Miss Gilchrist?'

1224
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,240
Susan shook her head.

1225
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,800
'I don't really know much about her.

1226
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:25,400
She was with my aunt for some 
years - that's all I know.'

1227
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,760
'Right.

1228
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,000
Well, I must go now.'

1229
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:36,200
The cottage felt hot and uncomfortable 
and when he had gone Susan left the front  

1230
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:44,640
door wide open and she went slowly upstairs to 
continue going through Aunt Cora's belongings.

1231
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,600
There was a box full of old 
photographs and drawing books.

1232
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:57,280
Susan put them to one side, sorted all the papers 
she had found, and began to go through them.

1233
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:02,040
About a quarter way through she came to a letter.

1234
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,560
She read it twice and was still staring at it,  

1235
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:10,280
when a voice behind her 
made her give a cry of fear.

1236
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:18,000
'And what have you got hold of there, 
Susan? Hello, what's the matter?'

1237
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,840
'George? How you frightened me!'

1238
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,040
Her cousin smiled at her.

1239
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,520
'So it seems.'

1240
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:29,000
'How did you get here?'

1241
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,560
'Well, the front door was open, so I walked in.

1242
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,360
There was nobody about on the 
ground floor, so I came up here.

1243
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:42,600
If you mean how did I get to this part 
of the world, I decided this morning  

1244
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:49,720
to come to the funeral, but the car broke 
down, then seemed to start working again.

1245
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:54,640
I was too late for the funeral by then, 
but I thought I might as well continue  

1246
01:48:54,640 --> 01:49:01,520
the journey because I rang your flat and 
Greg told me you'd come to sort things out.

1247
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,800
I thought I might help you.'

1248
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:10,480
Susan said, 'Can you take 
days off whenever you like?'

1249
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:15,360
'A funeral has always been an 
acceptable excuse for taking a day off.

1250
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:21,840
Anyway, I won't be going to the office 
in future - not now that I'm rich.

1251
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:31,760
I will have better things to do.' He 
paused and smiled, 'Same as Greg.'

1252
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,440
Susan had never seen much of 
this cousin of hers and had  

1253
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:40,120
always found him rather difficult to understand.

1254
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:43,960
'Why did you really come down here, George?'

1255
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:47,480
'I came to do a little detective 
work to try and find out whether  

1256
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:52,640
Aunt Cora really did know that 
someone had killed Uncle Richard.

1257
01:49:53,160 --> 01:50:00,000
Now, what's in that letter that you were 
reading so carefully when I came in?'

1258
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,280
'It's a letter that Uncle Richard wrote 
to Cora after he'd been here to see her.'

1259
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:15,720
How very black George's eyes were; and black 
eyes hid the thoughts that lay behind them.

1260
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:22,120
George said slowly, 'Anything interesting in it?'

1261
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,200
'No, not exactly.,.'

1262
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,360
'Can I see?'

1263
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:32,680
She hesitated for a moment, then 
put the letter into his hand.

1264
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,840
He read some of it aloud.

1265
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,480
'Pleased to have seen you 
again after all these years...

1266
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,800
looking very well...

1267
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:50,360
had a good journey home and arrived back not 
too tired...' His voice changed suddenly,  

1268
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:58,040
'Please don't say anything to 
anyone about what I told you.

1269
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:01,440
It may be a mistake.

1270
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:06,760
Your loving brother, Richard.'

1271
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:09,880
He looked up at Susan.

1272
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,360
'What does that mean?'

1273
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,280
'It might mean anything...'

1274
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:18,200
'Oh yes, but it does suggest something.

1275
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:22,080
Does anyone know what he told Cora?'

1276
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,720
'Miss Gilchrist might know,' said Susan.

1277
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:28,920
'I think she listened at the door to them.

1278
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:34,000
But she's in hospital; she's 
got arsenic poisoning.'

1279
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,760
'You don't mean it?' George exclaimed.

1280
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,960
'I do.

1281
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:46,280
Someone sent her some poisoned 
wedding cake.' George whistled.

1282
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:50,120
'It looks,' he said, 'as though Uncle Richard  

1283
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:59,800
was not mistaken when he talked 
about being poisoned himself.'

1284
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:05,320
The following morning Inspector 
Morton called at the cottage.

1285
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:11,800
'Arsenic was found in the small pieces of 
wedding cake that Dr Proctor took from here.

1286
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:16,840
Miss Gilchrist keeps saying that 
nobody would do such a thing.

1287
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:19,440
But somebody did.

1288
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:24,760
You don't know anything that 
might help us, Mrs Banks?'

1289
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:27,600
Susan shook her head.

1290
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,520
'Well, young Andrews, the driver of the post van,  

1291
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:36,240
doesn't remember delivering the 
parcel with the wedding cake in it.

1292
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:41,520
He can't be sure, though, so 
there's a doubt about it.'

1293
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,960
'But - what's the alternative?'

1294
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:50,880
'The alternative, Mrs Banks, is that an old 
piece of brown paper was used to wrap the  

1295
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:59,040
parcel that already had Miss Gilchrist's name 
and address on it and a used postage stamp.

1296
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,880
That package was then pushed 
through the letter box or  

1297
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:09,720
put inside the door by hand to make 
her think that it had come by post.

1298
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,600
It's a clever idea to choose wedding cake.

1299
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:18,800
Lonely middle-aged women are 
sentimental about wedding cake  

1300
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,440
because they are so pleased to have 
been remembered by the young couple.'

1301
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:29,040
'Was there enough poison in it to - kill?'

1302
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,800
'That depends on whether 
Miss Gilchrist ate all of it.

1303
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:40,520
She thinks that she didn't, so I'd like to 
go upstairs if you don't mind, Mrs Banks.'

1304
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:47,440
'Of course.' She followed him up 
to Miss Gilchrist's room and said,  

1305
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:50,480
'I'm afraid it's in a terrible state.

1306
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,520
I didn't have time to clean up before the funeral  

1307
01:53:53,520 --> 01:54:00,960
and then after Dr Proctor came I thought 
perhaps I ought to leave it as it was.'

1308
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:09,480
'That was very intelligent of you, Mrs Banks.' 
He went to the bed and lifted the pillow.

1309
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:13,880
'There you are,' he said, smiling.

1310
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:17,520
A piece of wedding cake lay on the sheet.

1311
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,080
'How extraordinary,' said Susan.

1312
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,560
'Oh no, it's not.

1313
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,720
Perhaps your generation doesn't do it.

1314
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,200
But it's an old custom.

1315
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:33,640
They say that if you put a piece 
of wedding cake under your pillow,  

1316
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,440
you'll dream of your future husband.

1317
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,400
Miss Gilchrist didn't want to tell us about it,  

1318
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,760
I suspect, because she felt silly 
doing such a thing at her age.

1319
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:52,440
But I thought that's what it might 
be.' His face became serious.

1320
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:56,880
'And if it hadn't been for 
an old maid's foolishness,  

1321
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:03,880
Miss Gilchrist might not be 
alive today.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1322
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,280
CHAPTER TWELVE

1323
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:12,120
Two elderly men sat together in a 
room where everything was square.

1324
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:19,640
Almost the only exception was Hercule 
Poirot: whose stomach was pleasantly rounded,  

1325
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:27,880
his head looked like an egg in shape, and 
his moustache curved upwards flamboyantly.

1326
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:33,640
He was looking thoughtfully at 
Mr Goby, who was small and thin.

1327
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:38,640
Mr Goby was famous for collecting information.

1328
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,160
Very few people knew about him and very few  

1329
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:48,720
employed his services - but those 
few were usually extremely rich.

1330
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:52,240
They had to be, for Mr Goby was very expensive.

1331
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:59,400
His speciality was getting information - quickly.

1332
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:03,880
At a word from Mr Goby, hundreds of men and women,  

1333
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:12,440
old and young, who worked for him, went out 
to question, investigate, and get results.

1334
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:17,080
Mr Goby had now almost retired from business.

1335
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:21,840
But he occasionally worked for a few old clients.

1336
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:26,480
Hercule Poirot was one of these.

1337
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:35,520
Mr Goby was not looking at Hercule Poirot 
because Mr Goby never looked directly at anybody.

1338
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,200
Right now he seemed to be 
talking to the fireplace.

1339
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:43,720
'I've got what information I could for you.

1340
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:49,920
Nowadays you can walk in almost anywhere 
with a notebook and pencil and ask people  

1341
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,400
all about their lives and they 
won't doubt for a minute that  

1342
01:56:54,400 --> 01:57:01,520
you are working for the Government - and 
that the Government really wants to know!

1343
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:11,240
Yes, Government snooping is a gift to 
investigators and long may it continue!

1344
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:18,800
'Now,' said Mr Goby, and took out a 
little notebook and turned over the pages.

1345
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,320
'Here we are.

1346
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,160
Mr George Crossfield.

1347
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:26,560
He's been in debt for a while now.

1348
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:31,080
He's been using money from 
his clients' trust funds.

1349
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:36,480
For three months he's been worried 
and bad-tempered in the office.

1350
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:42,240
But since his uncle's death that's all changed!

1351
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:48,440
'What he said about being at Hurst 
Park races is almost certainly untrue.

1352
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:53,600
None of the people he usually 
places his bets with saw him.

1353
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:00,800
Nobody saw him in Lytchett St Mary either, 
but that doesn't mean he wasn't there.

1354
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:06,600
There are other ways to approach the 
cottage than through the village.

1355
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,800
He acted in plays at university, by the way.

1356
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:17,880
So if he went to the cottage that day, he could 
have used make up to change the way he looks.

1357
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,880
I'll keep him in my book, shall I?'

1358
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:27,640
'You may keep him in,' said Hercule Poirot.

1359
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,920
Mr Goby turned another page.

1360
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,280
'Mr Michael Shane.

1361
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:37,640
He likes money and is very attractive to women.

1362
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:42,440
He's been having an affair with 
Sorrel Dainton, the actress,  

1363
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:46,120
and his wife Rosamund doesn't know about it.

1364
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:49,240
She doesn't know much about anything, it seems.

1365
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:55,160
She's not a good actress, and 
is crazy about her husband.

1366
01:58:55,160 --> 01:59:01,480
'On the day Mr Shane says he was meeting 
a Mr Rosenheim and a Mr Oscar Lewis for  

1367
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:09,160
lunch to discuss a play, he sent them 
a telegram to say he couldn't come.

1368
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:19,520
What he did do was to go to the Emeraldo Car 
people and hire a car at about twelve o'clock.

1369
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,800
He returned it at about six in the evening.

1370
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:28,360
The car had been driven just 
about the right number of miles,  

1371
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:33,200
but it was not seen in Lytchett St Mary that day.

1372
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:38,760
However, there are lots of places he could 
have left it hidden a mile or so away;  

1373
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:45,000
there's even an old quarry a few hundred 
yards down the road from the cottage.

1374
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,760
Do we keep Mr Shane in?'

1375
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,040
'Most certainly.'

1376
01:59:52,560 --> 02:00:01,600
'Now Mrs Shane.' Mr Goby told his 
left sleeve about Rosamund Shane.

1377
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,120
'She says she was shopping.

1378
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:09,000
And she had heard she had 
inherited money the day before.

1379
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,680
She has accounts in a number of 
shops but she hasn't paid her bills,  

1380
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:20,400
so it's possible that she went in 
here and there, trying on clothes,  

1381
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:27,680
looking at jewellery, checking 
prices - and not buying anything!

1382
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:31,920
I asked one of my young ladies, who's 
knowledgeable about the theatre and  

1383
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:38,280
the people in it, to follow her and 
stop by her table in a restaurant,  

1384
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:45,640
She exclaimed the way they do, "Darling, 
I haven't seen you since Way Down Under.

1385
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:52,320
You were wonderful in that!" In a 
minute they were talking theatrical  

1386
02:00:52,320 --> 02:01:02,840
stuff and my girl then said, "I believe I saw 
you at so and so, on so and so," giving the day.

1387
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:09,720
Most ladies are tricked by that and say, 
"Oh no, I was..." whatever it may be.

1388
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:14,760
But Mrs Shane just looked 
blank and said, "Oh, maybe.

1389
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:21,920
I couldn't possibly remember." What 
can you do with a lady like that?'  

1390
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:27,160
Mr Goby shook his head sadly.

1391
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:32,080
'Nothing,' said Hercule Poirot with some feeling.

1392
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:36,640
'I shall never forget the killing of Lord Edgware.

1393
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:40,360
I was nearly defeated - yes,  

1394
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:50,720
I, Hercule Poirot - by the extremely 
simple cleverness of an empty brain.

1395
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:56,200
Very simple-minded people often 
have the unexpected intelligence  

1396
02:01:56,200 --> 02:02:02,560
to commit a simple crime and then leave it alone.

1397
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:07,360
Let us hope that our murderer is intelligent and  

1398
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:13,640
thoroughly pleased with himself 
and unable to resist showing off.

1399
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:19,520
But continue.'

1400
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:23,800
Once more Mr Goby looked at his little book.

1401
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:28,920
'Mr and Mrs Banks said they were at home all day.

1402
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,280
Well, Susan Banks wasn't.

1403
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:39,960
She went round to the garage, got out her 
car, and drove off in it at about one o'clock.

1404
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:46,400
We do not know where she went 
and she came back at about five.

1405
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:53,520
I have no idea how many miles she did 
that day because she drives every day and,  

1406
02:02:53,520 --> 02:03:00,920
unlike Michael Shane's hired car, 
no one keeps a note of the mileage.

1407
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:05,600
'As for Mr Gregory Banks, 
we don't know what he did.

1408
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,560
He didn't go to work and it seems he had already  

1409
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:12,720
asked for a couple of days 
off because of the funeral.

1410
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:18,360
Since then he's left his job - 
where they do not like Mr Banks.

1411
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:23,760
He used to become very angry at 
even small things that upset him.

1412
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:29,000
Until about four months ago - just 
before he met his wife and joined  

1413
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,840
this particular chemist's shop - he 
was in a nursing home as a patient.

1414
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:42,840
He had made some mistake with a medicine he made 
for a customer at the pharmacy he worked at then.

1415
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:46,920
The woman recovered, and there was no prosecution.

1416
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:51,840
The shop didn't sack him, but he 
resigned and told the doctor he was  

1417
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,480
filled with guilt - that he 
had done it deliberately.

1418
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,920
He said that the woman had been rude 
to him when she came into the shop,  

1419
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:08,040
and so he had added an almost lethal dose 
of some drug or other to her medicine.

1420
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:14,040
"She had to be punished for speaking 
to me like that!" was what he said.

1421
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:17,280
The doctors don't believe 
it was deliberate at all,  

1422
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:24,240
he was just careless, but they say that he 
wanted to make it important and serious.

1423
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:32,120
Anyway, this nursing home cured him and 
sent him home, and he met Susan Abernethie.

1424
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:36,280
He got the job he's just left 
and another pharmacist at the  

1425
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:41,520
same shop said he had a very bad temper.'

1426
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,280
'Mon ami' said Hercule Poirot.

1427
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:50,240
'It really amazes me how you get your information!

1428
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:55,400
Medical and highly confidential most of it!'

1429
02:04:55,400 --> 02:05:01,400
Mr Goby said, looking at the 
door, that there were ways...

1430
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:05,640
'Now we come to Mr and Mrs Timothy Abernethie.

1431
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:08,440
They are very short of money.

1432
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:15,680
Mr Abernethie enjoys being ill and 
the emphasis is on the enjoyment.

1433
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:21,720
He has everyone fetching and carrying 
things for him because he says he's too  

1434
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:30,640
ill to do anything for himself, but he eats 
large meals, and seems strong physically.

1435
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:35,360
There's no one in the house after 
the daily cleaning woman leaves,  

1436
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:42,800
and she says he was in a very bad temper on 
the morning of the day after the funeral.

1437
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:51,640
He was alone in the house and nobody saw him from 
9.30 that morning until the following morning.'

1438
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:57,080
'And Mrs Maude Abernethie?'

1439
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,560
'Everyone says she is a very nice lady.

1440
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:08,160
She left Enderby by car and arrived on foot 
at a small garage in a village on the way.

1441
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:13,880
She explained that her car had 
broken down a couple of miles away.

1442
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:17,720
'A mechanic drove her out to it 
and said they would have to get  

1443
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:21,560
it in to the garage and it would be a long job.

1444
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:29,640
The lady went to a small hotel, arranged to stay 
the night, and asked for some sandwiches to take  

1445
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:36,920
with her as she said she would like to go out 
walking and see something of the countryside.

1446
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:42,960
She didn't come back to the 
hotel till late that evening.'

1447
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:45,800
'And the times?'

1448
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:49,160
'She got the sandwiches at eleven.

1449
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:54,880
If she had walked to the main road, a mile 
away, she could have got a lift into a town  

1450
02:06:54,880 --> 02:07:02,800
called Wallcaster and caught an express 
train which stops near Lytchett St Mary.

1451
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:10,920
It could just have been done if the murder 
had happened fairly late in the afternoon.'

1452
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:15,160
'What exactly was wrong with the car?'

1453
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:19,680
'Do you want the exact details, Monsieur Poirot?'

1454
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,880
'No, no!

1455
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,920
I have no mechanical knowledge.'

1456
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:27,480
'It was a difficult thing to find.

1457
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:29,400
And also to fix.

1458
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,920
And it could have been done deliberately  

1459
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:37,120
by someone who was familiar 
with the insides of a car.'

1460
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:40,560
'Wonderful!' said Poirot.

1461
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:48,520
'Can we clear nobody from suspicion? 
And Mrs Helen Abernethie?'

1462
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:54,640
'She's a very nice lady, too, and Mr 
Richard Abernethie was very fond of her.

1463
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:59,920
She came there to stay about 
two weeks before he died.'

1464
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:06,240
'Was that after he had been to 
Lytchett St Mary to see his sister?'

1465
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:08,720
'No, just before.

1466
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:14,000
Mrs Helen's income is less, since 
the war, than it used to be.

1467
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:19,280
She has a house in Cyprus and 
spends part of the year there.

1468
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:25,320
She also has a young nephew 
whose school fees she is paying.'

1469
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:28,280
Poirot shut his eyes.

1470
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:33,240
'And it was impossible for her to 
have left Enderby that day without  

1471
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:39,680
the servants knowing? Say that is so, I beg you!'

1472
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:43,680
Mr Goby looked down at Poirot's shoes.

1473
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:47,600
'I'm afraid I can't say that, Monsieur Poirot.

1474
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:51,840
Mrs Abernethie went to London 
to get some extra clothes  

1475
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:59,600
because she had agreed with Mr Entwhistle 
to stay on and see to things.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1476
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:02,360
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

1477
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:06,360
Inspector Morton came straight to the point.

1478
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,640
'I had to come to London,' he said.

1479
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:13,400
'And I found your address, Monsieur Poirot.

1480
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:17,400
I was interested to see you 
at the inquest on Thursday  

1481
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:21,440
and I came to ask if you could help us at all.

1482
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:25,280
Something must have brought you 
down there, Monsieur Poirot,  

1483
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:33,480
and there have been developments.' And he 
told him about the poisoned wedding cake.

1484
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:37,760
Poirot took a deep, slow breath.

1485
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:42,400
'I warned Mr Entwhistle to 
look after Miss Gilchrist.

1486
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,760
An attack on her was always a possibility.

1487
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:51,320
But I must admit that I did not expect poison.'

1488
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:57,440
'But why did you think she might be attacked?'

1489
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:03,080
Poirot said, 'It begins, all this, at a funeral.

1490
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:10,160
Or rather, to be exact, after 
the funeral.' And he told the  

1491
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:14,520
story as Mr Entwhistle had told it to him.

1492
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:22,760
Then Poirot continued, 'This attempt to 
silence Miss Gilchrist, it is a mistake.

1493
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:29,600
For now there are two events which 
you need to investigate further.'

1494
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,560
'Yes.

1495
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,280
Well, if the postman did deliver the wedding cake,  

1496
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:41,040
it seems odd that the parcel wasn't 
noticed until after this Mr Guthrie came.

1497
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,920
We're checking up on him, of course.

1498
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:48,600
He could have placed that parcel 
where Miss Gilchrist found it.

1499
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:54,120
Now, Mr George Crossfield 
was in the area next day.

1500
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:57,920
What do you know about him, Monsieur Poirot?'

1501
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,480
'Not as much as I would like to.'

1502
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:05,200
'It's like that, is it? There are quite a lot of  

1503
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:10,520
people who are interested in the late 
Mr Abernethie's will, I understand.

1504
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,480
I hope it doesn't mean investigating all of them!'

1505
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:20,000
'I have a little information 
which you may not have.

1506
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,560
Naturally I have no authority 
to ask these people questions.

1507
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:31,360
In fact, it would not be wise for me to do so.'

1508
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:35,560
'I will go slowly myself,' said Morton.

1509
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:40,520
'I don't want to warn anyone 
until it suits me to.'

1510
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,840
Poirot smiled.

1511
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,960
'A very wise way of working.

1512
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:50,400
For myself I go to Enderby Hall.

1513
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:54,840
It is people that I am interested in.

1514
02:11:54,840 --> 02:12:02,600
I will pretend to buy, I believe, a 
big country house for foreign refugees.

1515
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:07,600
I will represent U.N.A.R.C.O.'

1516
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:13,360
And what's U.N.A.R.C.O.?' asked Morton, puzzled.

1517
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:19,040
'The United Nations Aid for 
Refugee Centre Organization.

1518
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:28,320
It sounds appropriate, do you not think? 
And Enderby Hall might be just right.

1519
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:36,280
I will, of course tell Mrs Helen 
Abernethie the truth and ask for her help.'

1520
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:40,800
Inspector Morton smiled.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1521
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,400
CHAPTER FOURTEEN

1522
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:50,360
Two days later, Hercule Poirot said to 
the Enderby Hall housemaid, 'Thank you.

1523
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:53,920
You have been most kind.'

1524
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,920
Janet left the room.

1525
02:12:56,920 --> 02:13:00,360
These foreigners, she thought!

1526
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:02,760
The questions they asked.

1527
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:07,280
It was all very well for Mrs 
Helen Abernethie to say that  

1528
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:14,680
Monsieur Pontarlier was a doctor who wanted 
to buy the house and was also interested in  

1529
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:21,160
unsuspected heart conditions such as 
the one Mr Abernethie must have had.

1530
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:26,080
But what business was it of his 
to nose around asking questions  

1531
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:31,360
about the medicines the Master had 
taken, and where they were kept!

1532
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:36,000
And asking if any of the medicines 
he took were still in the house.

1533
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,320
Of course they had all been thrown away.

1534
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:45,840
Poirot went downstairs in search of Lanscombe.

1535
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:51,240
It was quite clear to him that anybody could 
have got into the house on the day before  

1536
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:56,760
Richard Abernethie died, and put 
poison into one of his medicines.

1537
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:00,040
Or someone could have put poison pills  

1538
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:05,000
into the bottle next to his bed 
where his sleeping pills were.

1539
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,160
This was more likely.

1540
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:11,880
The front door was kept locked at all times,  

1541
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:18,800
but there was a side door that led to the 
garden which was not locked until the evening.

1542
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,160
At about quarter-past one, when the gardeners had  

1543
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,920
gone to lunch and when the household 
was in the dining room or kitchen,  

1544
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:33,440
Poirot had entered the grounds through the 
main gate, walked through the garden to the  

1545
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:42,240
side door, and gone up the stairs to Richard 
Abernethie's bedroom without meeting anybody.

1546
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,320
Yes, it could have been done.

1547
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:53,240
But the murder - if it was murder - of 
Richard Abernethie could never be proved.

1548
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:58,680
It was Cora Lansquenet's murder 
for which evidence was needed.

1549
02:14:58,680 --> 02:15:03,320
What Poirot now wanted was to study 
the people who had been at the

1550
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:12,640
funeral by watching and talking to them, and 
then make his own conclusions about them.

1551
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,840
'Yes, Sir?' Lanscombe said politely.

1552
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:21,160
'Mrs Abernethie tells me that you had hoped  

1553
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:26,280
to live in the cottage by 
the gates when you retired?'

1554
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,680
'That is so, Sir.

1555
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:32,600
Naturally all that is changed now.

1556
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:38,320
When...' Poirot interrupted, 
'It might still be possible.

1557
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:45,760
The cottage is not needed for the U.N.A.R.C.O 
guests and the people who will look after them.'

1558
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:48,360
'Well, thank you, Sir.

1559
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:53,600
Most of the guests would be 
foreigners, wouldn't they?'

1560
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,920
'Yes.

1561
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:58,280
Amongst those who came from Europe to this country  

1562
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:05,440
before and during the war are 
several who are old and unwell.

1563
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:12,120
The organization I work for has raised 
money to buy country homes for them.

1564
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:17,240
This place is, I think, very suitable.'

1565
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:19,960
Lanscombe sighed.

1566
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:23,560
'If Enderby Hall has to be sold,  

1567
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:29,480
I'm pleased to think that it's going to 
be the kind of place you're talking about.

1568
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:33,120
We've always welcomed the 
unfortunate in this country,  

1569
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:39,120
Sir; it has always been something to be proud of.'

1570
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:44,000
'Thank you, Lanscombe,' said Poirot gently.

1571
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:49,840
'Your Master's death must have 
been a great shock to you.'

1572
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:50,840
'It was, Sir.

1573
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,840
No one could have had a better Master.'

1574
02:16:56,840 --> 02:17:03,960
'I have been talking with my friend 
and - er - colleague, Dr Larraby.

1575
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:09,200
We were wondering if your Master could 
have had an unpleasant interview on the  

1576
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:18,720
day before he died? You do not remember if 
any visitors came to the house that day?'

1577
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:22,560
'Some nuns called, collecting money for sick  

1578
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:28,960
children - and a young man came to 
the back door to sell some brushes.

1579
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:34,600
Nobody else.'

1580
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:40,080
Poirot went to see Marjorie, the cook, 
and had no difficulty in finding out  

1581
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:45,800
exactly what had been served at dinner the 
night before Richard Abernethie had died,  

1582
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:49,800
but he learned nothing of value from her.

1583
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:54,160
He went now to get his overcoat 
and a couple of scarves,  

1584
02:17:54,160 --> 02:18:01,760
and went out into the garden and joined Helen 
Abernethie, who was cutting some flowers.

1585
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:06,160
'Have you found out anything new?' she asked.

1586
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,439
'Nothing.

1587
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:10,719
But I did not expect to do so.

1588
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:20,200
Now tell me, Madame, of those at Mr Richard 
Abernethie's funeral, who knew Cora best?'

1589
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:20,760
'Lanscombe.

1590
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:25,560
He remembers her from when she was a child.

1591
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:31,880
The housemaid, Janet, came after 
Cora had married and gone away.'

1592
02:18:31,880 --> 02:18:35,840
'And after Lanscombe?'

1593
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:41,720
Helen said thoughtfully, 'I suppose - I did.'

1594
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:44,200
'Then why, on the day of the funeral,  

1595
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:51,080
do you think she asked that question 
about Richard Abernethie being murdered?'

1596
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,160
Helen smiled.

1597
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:56,040
'It was very typical of Cora!

1598
02:18:56,040 --> 02:18:59,840
But I never knew whether she 
was just innocently asking  

1599
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:05,760
such questions - or whether 
she wanted to shock people.'

1600
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:08,800
Poirot changed the subject.

1601
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:14,200
'Mrs Maude Abernethie stayed 
the night after the funeral.

1602
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:20,720
Did she talk to you at all about what 
Cora had said? Did she take it seriously?'

1603
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:24,680
'Oh no.'

1604
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:30,201
'And you, Madame, did you take it seriously?'

1605
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:35,920
Helen Abernethie said thoughtfully, 
'Yes, Monsieur Poirot,

1606
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:38,600
I think I did.'

1607
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:43,600
'Because of your feeling 
that something was wrong?'

1608
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:45,600
'Perhaps.'

1609
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:50,720
He continued, 'There had been a 
separation, lasting many years,  

1610
02:19:50,720 --> 02:20:00,880
between Mrs Lansquenet and her family, and then, 
suddenly, Richard Abernethie went to see her.

1611
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,920
Why?'

1612
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:05,000
'I really don't know.

1613
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:12,800
He told me that he was going to see his brother 
Timothy, but he never mentioned Cora at all.'

1614
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:20,280
As they went in by the side door, Poirot 
said, 'You are sure that during your visit,  

1615
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:27,920
Richard said nothing to you about any member 
of the family which might be relevant?'

1616
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:32,480
Helen said, 'You are speaking like a policeman.'

1617
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:35,919
'I was a policeman - once.

1618
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:42,040
And you want the truth, Mr Entwhistle tells me?'

1619
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:49,120
Helen said with a sigh, 'Richard was 
disappointed in the younger generation.

1620
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:57,120
But there was nothing - nothing - that 
could possibly suggest a motive for murder.'

1621
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,720
'Ah,' said Poirot.

1622
02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:06,680
In the sitting room Helen began 
to arrange the flowers in a bowl.

1623
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:10,000
'You arrange these beautifully, Madame.

1624
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:17,240
I think that anything you do, you 
would manage to do with perfection.'

1625
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:19,040
'Thank you, Monsieur.

1626
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:24,760
I think this would look good 
on that green marble table.'

1627
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:30,520
There was a bouquet of wax flowers 
under a glass shade on the table.

1628
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:38,440
As she lifted it off, Poirot said, 'Did 
anyone tell Mr Abernethie that his niece  

1629
02:21:38,439 --> 02:21:47,359
Susan's husband had almost poisoned a 
customer when making up a medicine? Ah!'

1630
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:50,639
The shade had slipped from Helen's fingers.

1631
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:54,161
It dropped on the floor and broke.

1632
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:56,439
'How careless of me.

1633
02:21:56,439 --> 02:22:00,120
However, I can get a new glass shade.

1634
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:06,720
I'll put the flowers and the broken 
shade in the cupboard behind the stairs.'

1635
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:09,120
It was not until Poirot had helped her to  

1636
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:14,960
carry the pieces to the cupboard 
that he said, 'It was my fault.

1637
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:18,800
I should not have shocked you.'

1638
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:23,920
'What was it that you asked me? I have forgotten.'

1639
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,640
'Oh, there is no need to repeat my question.

1640
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:33,600
Indeed - I have forgotten what it was.'

1641
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:36,920
Helen put her hand on his arm.

1642
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:43,640
'Monsieur Poirot, is there anyone who doesn't 
have secrets that they would prefer stayed  

1643
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:52,560
secret? Must these things be revealed when 
they have nothing to do with - with...'

1644
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:57,760
'With the death of Cora Lansquenet? Yes.

1645
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:06,760
Because one has to examine everything, 
and everyone has something to hide.

1646
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:10,920
I say to you, nothing can be ignored.

1647
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:15,279
I am not the police and what 
I learn does not interest me.

1648
02:23:15,279 --> 02:23:18,479
But I have to know.

1649
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:24,279
I need, Madame, to meet everyone who 
was here on the day of the funeral.

1650
02:23:24,279 --> 02:23:33,200
And it would be much easier if I could 
meet them here, and so I have a plan.

1651
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:39,679
The house, Mr Entwhistle will tell the 
family, is to be bought by U.N.A.R.C.O.,  

1652
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:45,640
and I will be here as that 
organization's representative.

1653
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:53,040
I will call myself Monsieur Pontarlier and 
Mr Entwhistle will invite the family to  

1654
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:59,519
come here and choose those things they 
would like before everything is sold.

1655
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,760
The young people will come easily.

1656
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:11,440
But the problem is that Mr Timothy 
Abernethie never leaves his home.'

1657
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:13,599
Helen smiled.

1658
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:17,280
'I believe you may be lucky 
there, Monsieur Poirot.

1659
02:24:17,279 --> 02:24:19,880
I spoke to Maude yesterday.

1660
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:21,240
They have workmen in,  

1661
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:27,679
painting the house and Timothy says the 
smell of the paint is making him ill.

1662
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:32,600
I think that they would be pleased 
to come here for a week or two.

1663
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:39,640
Maude is still not able to move around 
very well because she broke her ankle.'

1664
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,520
'I had not heard.

1665
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,640
How unfortunate.'

1666
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:49,640
'Luckily they have got Cora's 
companion, Miss Gilchrist, with them.

1667
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:53,920
She has turned out to be a huge help.'

1668
02:24:53,920 --> 02:25:01,000
'Did they ask for Miss Gilchrist 
to go to them? Who suggested it?'

1669
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,920
'Susan fixed it up.

1670
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:05,240
Susan Banks.'

1671
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:08,639
'Aha,' said Poirot.

1672
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:12,680
'Susan likes to make arrangements.

1673
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:19,241
Did you hear that Miss Gilchrist 
was poisoned and nearly died?'

1674
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:22,960
'No!' Helen looked shocked.

1675
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:24,000
'Oh!

1676
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,600
Get them all here!

1677
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,000
Find out the truth!

1678
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,040
There mustn't be any more murders.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1679
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,560
CHAPTER FIFTEEN

1680
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:39,800
At Maude and Timothy Abernethie's house, 
Miss Gilchrist had hurried out to the  

1681
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:44,800
hall to answer the telephone, 
which was behind the staircase.

1682
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:50,240
'It's Mrs Helen Abernethie 
speaking,' she called up to Maude.

1683
02:25:52,120 --> 02:26:01,279
'Tell her I'm just coming.' Maude came down 
the stairs slowly because of her broken ankle.

1684
02:26:01,279 --> 02:26:08,719
Miss Gilchrist said quietly, 'I'm so sorry 
you've had to come down, Mrs Abernethie.

1685
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:14,080
I'll just go up and get Mr 
Abernethie's coffee tray.'

1686
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:18,240
Timothy looked at Miss Gilchrist angrily.

1687
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:25,040
As she picked up the tray he asked, 
'Who's that on the telephone?'

1688
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:27,800
'Mrs Helen Abernethie.'

1689
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:31,520
'Oh? I suppose they'll talk for an hour!

1690
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:38,041
Pull that curtain aside, will 
you? And - Where are you going?'

1691
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:41,399
'It's the front doorbell, Mr Abernethie.'

1692
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:49,120
'I didn't hear anything,' Timothy said 
as Miss Gilchrist quickly left the room.

1693
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:52,479
Moments later she came up to Maude Abernethie,  

1694
02:26:52,479 --> 02:26:58,200
who was still on the telephone, to 
say, 'I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1695
02:26:58,200 --> 02:26:59,639
It's a nun.

1696
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:02,120
Collecting.'

1697
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:06,439
Maude Abernethie said into 
the telephone, 'Just a moment,  

1698
02:27:06,439 --> 02:27:15,120
Helen,' and to Miss Gilchrist, 'I 
only give money to our local church.'

1699
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:19,120
Miss Gilchrist hurried away again.

1700
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:24,319
Maude finished her conversation 
and came into the front hall.

1701
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:30,080
Miss Gilchrist was standing completely 
still by the sitting room door.

1702
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:33,880
She jumped when Maude spoke to her.

1703
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:38,040
'There's nothing the matter, 
is there, Miss Gilchrist?'

1704
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:44,500
'Oh no, Mrs Abernethie, I was 
thinking about something..

1705
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:46,040
.'

1706
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:51,840
Maude Abernethie climbed the stairs 
painfully to her husband's room.

1707
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,440
'That was Helen.

1708
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:57,439
Enderby Hall is definitely sold.

1709
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:03,399
Helen suggests that we might like to 
go there for a visit before it goes.

1710
02:28:03,399 --> 02:28:09,439
She was very upset about the way the smell 
of the paint is affecting your health.

1711
02:28:09,439 --> 02:28:16,479
The servants are there still, so you 
could be looked after comfortably.'

1712
02:28:16,479 --> 02:28:22,839
Timothy, who had been looking angry, 
now nodded his head approvingly.

1713
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:26,400
'It's thoughtful of Helen,' he said.

1714
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:31,160
'But moving might be too much for me.'

1715
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:35,760
'Perhaps you'd prefer a hotel, dear,' said Maude.

1716
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:41,440
'A good hotel is very expensive, 
but where your health is...'

1717
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:43,559
Timothy interrupted.

1718
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:47,161
'Maude, we are not millionaires.

1719
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:52,840
Why go to a hotel when Helen has very 
kindly suggested that we could go to  

1720
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:58,520
Enderby? Not that it's really for her to suggest!

1721
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:04,280
And I would like to see the 
old place again before I die.

1722
02:29:04,279 --> 02:29:07,479
Yes, it is an excellent plan.

1723
02:29:07,479 --> 02:29:12,559
The painters can finish while 
we are away and that Gillespie  

1724
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:17,480
woman can stay here and look after the house.'

1725
02:29:17,479 --> 02:29:22,240
'She's called Gilchrist,' said Maude.

1726
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:29,240
Timothy waved a hand and said that 
it didn't matter what her name was.

1727
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:33,000
'I can't do it,' said Miss Gilchrist.

1728
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
She was shaking.

1729
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,840
'I simply can't stay here all alone.

1730
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:46,400
I've never been a nervous woman - but now 
I'd be terrified to be all alone here.'

1731
02:29:46,399 --> 02:29:49,000
'Of course,' said Maude.

1732
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:54,720
'It's stupid of me - after what 
happened at Lytchett St Mary.'

1733
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,360
'I suppose that it's...

1734
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,120
it's not logical, I know.

1735
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:04,840
But even that nun coming to the door startled me.

1736
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:11,400
Oh dear, I am in a bad way...'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1737
02:30:11,399 --> 02:30:14,200
CHAPTER SIXTEEN

1738
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:20,439
Hercule Poirot drank his after-dinner 
coffee slowly and between half-closed eyes  

1739
02:30:20,439 --> 02:30:23,719
looked at the other people in the room.

1740
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:29,720
He had wanted them there - all 
together, and he had got them.

1741
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:37,080
Mr Entwhistle had described all these people 
well but Poirot had wanted to see for himself,  

1742
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:48,399
then he would have a very good idea - not of how 
and when - but of who would be prepared to kill.

1743
02:30:48,399 --> 02:30:49,920
But it was not going to be easy.

1744
02:30:51,319 --> 02:30:58,880
He could see almost all of these people as 
a possible - though not a likely - murderer.

1745
02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:05,960
George Crossfield might kill - as a 
hunted animal might kill to defend itself.

1746
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:12,720
Susan Banks could do it calmly - 
efficiently - to further a plan.

1747
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:19,920
Gregory Banks could, because he had 
something in him which wanted punishment.

1748
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:26,480
Michael Shane was possible because he was 
ambitious and had a murderer's vanity.

1749
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:33,000
Rosamund Shane could, because she saw 
everything in the most simple way.

1750
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,439
Timothy Abernethie could do 
it because he really wanted  

1751
02:31:36,439 --> 02:31:40,679
the power his brother's money would give him.

1752
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:44,360
Maude Abernethie might be able because Timothy had  

1753
02:31:44,359 --> 02:31:52,040
become her child and where her child 
was concerned, she would be ruthless.

1754
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:55,720
Even Miss Gilchrist, he thought, 
might have thought about murdering  

1755
02:31:55,720 --> 02:32:01,520
someone if it could have given 
her back the Willow Tree tearoom!

1756
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:08,880
And Helen Abernethie? She was too 
civilized - too lacking in violence.

1757
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:13,960
And she had loved Richard Abernethie as a brother.

1758
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:16,000
Poirot sighed.

1759
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,040
There would have to be more conversation.

1760
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,040
Much more conversation.

1761
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:31,200
For in conversation, either through a lie or 
through truth, people always gave themselves away.

1762
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,000
He had been introduced by Helen to 
the group as Monsieur Pontarlier,  

1763
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,439
a doctor, the representative of U.N.A.R.C.O.

1764
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:45,759
He had watched and listened 
- openly and behind doors!

1765
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:50,800
He had talked with all of them, had 
spent a long half-hour listening to  

1766
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:57,600
Timothy talking about his health and 
the terrible effects of paint on it.

1767
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,760
Paint? Poirot frowned.

1768
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:08,680
Somebody else had said something 
about paint - Mr Entwhistle?

1769
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:13,320
There had also been a discussion 
of a different kind of painting.

1770
02:33:13,319 --> 02:33:18,639
Pierre Lansquenet as a painter; 
of Cora Lansquenet's paintings,  

1771
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:24,161
praised by Miss Gilchrist, laughed at by Susan.

1772
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:27,920
'Just like picture postcards,' she had said.

1773
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:32,040
'She painted them from postcards, too.'

1774
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:40,120
Miss Gilchrist had been upset and had said that 
dear Mrs Lansquenet always painted from nature.

1775
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:47,920
'But she didn't,' said Susan to Poirot when 
Miss Gilchrist had gone out of the room.

1776
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:49,720
'And how do you know?'

1777
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:55,520
Poirot watched the confident way Susan replied.

1778
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:01,000
She will always be sure, this one, he thought.

1779
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:08,080
And perhaps sometimes, she will be too sure...

1780
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:14,080
Susan continued, 'One picture is 
of a village called Polflexan,  

1781
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:17,120
showing the lighthouse and the pier.

1782
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:20,120
But the pier was destroyed in the war,  

1783
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:26,680
and since Aunt Cora's sketch was only done 
two years ago, it can't really be from nature,  

1784
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:33,920
can it? But the postcards they sell there 
still show the pier as it used to be.

1785
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:36,680
There was one in her bedroom.

1786
02:34:36,680 --> 02:34:41,840
It's funny, isn't it, the 
way people get found out?'

1787
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:47,480
'Yes, it is, as you say, funny.'

1788
02:34:47,479 --> 02:34:54,160
'I suppose you'll have to cut Enderby up 
and have lots of horrible small rooms.'

1789
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,639
'In the bedrooms, yes.

1790
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:01,680
But most of the ground floor 
rooms we shall not touch.

1791
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:04,320
Does it sadden you, Madame,  

1792
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:11,639
that this old family mansion of yours 
should go this way - to strangers?'

1793
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:15,800
'Of course not.' Susan looked amused.

1794
02:35:15,800 --> 02:35:19,760
'I've always thought the house 
was ugly on the outside - and  

1795
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:25,120
almost unacceptably luxurious inside.'

1796
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,760
'But I understand that you yourself are planning  

1797
02:35:28,760 --> 02:35:36,760
such a place? Everything luxurious 
and the best that money can buy.'

1798
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:38,680
Susan laughed.

1799
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:41,080
'It's just a place of business.

1800
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:48,160
Women think a great deal about their 
appearance - and that's where I come in.'

1801
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:49,639
'Tell me.'

1802
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:54,880
And she told him about her 
plans for a beauty salon.

1803
02:35:54,880 --> 02:36:02,600
He appreciated her business sense, her boldness 
of planning and her attention to detail.

1804
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:06,440
Perhaps a little ruthless...

1805
02:36:06,439 --> 02:36:12,719
Watching her, he had said, 'Yes, you will succeed.

1806
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:15,520
How fortunate that you have the money.

1807
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:19,560
To have had these creative ideas 
and to have had no money...'

1808
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:26,439
'I would have raised the money somehow 
- got someone to invest in me!'

1809
02:36:26,439 --> 02:36:27,120
'Ah!

1810
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:28,760
Of course.

1811
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:35,120
Even if he had not died, your 
uncle would have invested in you.'

1812
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,000
'Oh no, he wouldn't.

1813
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,240
Uncle Richard made me very angry.

1814
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:43,279
The old shouldn't stand in the way of the young.

1815
02:36:43,279 --> 02:36:48,439
I - oh, I beg your pardon.'

1816
02:36:48,439 --> 02:36:54,200
Hercule Poirot laughed easily 
and stroked his moustache.

1817
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:56,920
'I am old, yes.

1818
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:01,359
But I do not stand in the way of young people.

1819
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:07,399
And here is your husband come 
to join our little discussion...

1820
02:37:07,399 --> 02:37:15,960
We talk, Mr Banks, of opportunity - 
opportunity that must be taken with both hands.

1821
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:19,520
Let us hear your views.'

1822
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:25,760
But Gregory Banks said nothing!

1823
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:31,920
Poirot had talked with Maude Abernethie, who 
said how fortunate it had been that Timothy was  

1824
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:40,120
able to come to Enderby, and how kind it had 
been of Helen to invite Miss Gilchrist also.

1825
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:44,640
'For she is most useful,' Maude said.

1826
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:49,440
'It was really fortunate that she was 
too scared to stay alone in our house,  

1827
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:55,479
though I admit I was annoyed at the time.'

1828
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:58,080
'Too scared?'

1829
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:01,680
Poirot listened whilst Maude explained.

1830
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:09,160
'She was frightened, you say? And 
yet could not exactly say why? Had  

1831
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:14,680
anything particular happened that day?' he asked.

1832
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:16,920
'Oh, I don't think so.

1833
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:23,399
It seems to have started when she 
left Lytchett St Mary, or so she said.

1834
02:38:23,399 --> 02:38:28,599
She didn't seem to mind being 
alone when she was there.'

1835
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:36,760
And the result, Poirot thought, had 
been a piece of poisoned wedding cake.

1836
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:42,440
Not very surprising that Miss 
Gilchrist was frightened after that...

1837
02:38:42,439 --> 02:38:49,439
But something in Timothy Abernethie's 
house had made Miss Gilchrist afraid.

1838
02:38:50,279 --> 02:38:53,399
What?

1839
02:38:53,399 --> 02:38:55,920
Finding himself alone with Miss Gilchrist for  

1840
02:38:55,920 --> 02:39:01,600
a few minutes before dinner, 
Poirot had raised the subject.

1841
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:08,840
'It would be impossible for me to mention the 
matter of murder to members of the family.

1842
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:11,840
But I am fascinated.

1843
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:20,840
It was such a violent crime - to attack 
a sensitive artist in a lonely cottage.

1844
02:39:20,840 --> 02:39:23,600
Terrible for her family.

1845
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:28,320
But terrible, also, for you.

1846
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:35,000
Since Mrs Maude Abernethie says 
that you were there at the time?'

1847
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,600
'Yes, I was.

1848
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:43,920
And if you'll excuse me, Monsieur 
Pontarlier, I don't want to talk about it.'

1849
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:48,359
'I understand completely.'

1850
02:39:48,359 --> 02:39:49,319
Poirot waited.

1851
02:39:50,359 --> 02:39:56,719
And, as he had thought, Miss Gilchrist 
immediately began to talk about it.

1852
02:39:56,720 --> 02:40:04,480
'You were wise, I think, not to stay in that 
cottage alone,' he said when she had finished.

1853
02:40:04,479 --> 02:40:09,279
'I understand that you were even 
afraid to be alone in the house  

1854
02:40:09,279 --> 02:40:15,120
of Mr Timothy Abernethie whilst they came here?'

1855
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:17,240
'I'm ashamed about that.

1856
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:24,160
It was just a kind of panic I 
had - I really don't know why'

1857
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:28,399
'But you had just recovered from 
a terrible attempt to poison  

1858
02:40:28,399 --> 02:40:34,960
you - and you are still frightened, are you not?'

1859
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:37,800
'Oh, not since I came here.

1860
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:43,160
There are so many people and 
such a nice family atmosphere.

1861
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:48,479
Oh, no, everything seems all right here.'

1862
02:40:48,479 --> 02:40:54,000
'It seems to me that there must have been 
something that happened at Stansfield Grange,  

1863
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,680
Timothy and Maude's house, 
that made you so afraid.

1864
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:08,080
I think some small happening might have made 
your subconscious fears reach a high point.

1865
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:13,960
Now what, do you think, was this happening?'

1866
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:19,640
Miss Gilchrist thought for a 
moment, and then said, unexpectedly,  

1867
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:26,960
'I think, you know, Monsieur 
Pontarlier, it was the nun.'

1868
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:35,439
Before Poirot could question this, Susan and 
her husband came in, closely followed by Helen.

1869
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:39,040
'A nun,' thought Poirot...

1870
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:46,720
'Now where have I heard something about a nun? '

1871
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:53,360
He decided to lead the conversation on 
to nuns during the evening.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1872
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:56,160
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

1873
02:41:56,160 --> 02:42:00,000
The family's general opinion was 
that Helen should have avoided  

1874
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:05,840
having Monsieur Pontarlier at Enderby 
Hall during this particular weekend,  

1875
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:13,800
but fortunately this strange little 
foreigner did not seem to know much English.

1876
02:42:13,800 --> 02:42:19,560
After twenty-four hours of walking round 
and examining the contents of the house,  

1877
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:25,720
the heirs of Richard Abernethie 
were ready to say what they wanted.

1878
02:42:25,720 --> 02:42:33,600
'I don't suppose I have long to 
live,' said Timothy in a weak voice.

1879
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:42,480
And because I loved it as a child, I would 
like to have the Spode china dinner service.'

1880
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:46,120
'You're too late, Uncle,' George said.

1881
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:49,120
'I asked Helen for the Spode this morning.'

1882
02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:53,839
Timothy became purple in the face.

1883
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:58,640
'Now look here, I'm Richard's 
only surviving brother.

1884
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:02,520
That service is mine.'

1885
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:05,360
'No Uncle, the Spode's mine.

1886
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:08,279
First come, first served.'

1887
02:43:08,279 --> 02:43:18,160
'Nonsense!' Timothy placed a hand to his 
heart, and groaned, 'This is very bad for me.

1888
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:23,599
If I could have - a little brandy.'

1889
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:26,840
Miss Gilchrist hurried to get it.

1890
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:29,319
'Here you are, Mr Abernethie.

1891
02:43:29,319 --> 02:43:32,960
Please - please don't excite yourself.

1892
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:36,240
Are you sure you shouldn't go up to bed?'

1893
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:41,960
'Don't be a fool.' Timothy drank the brandy.

1894
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:47,040
'I'm not leaving this room until this is settled.'

1895
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,040
'Really, George,' said Maude.

1896
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:54,760
'If Timothy wants the Spode 
service, he will have it!'

1897
02:43:54,760 --> 02:43:58,280
'It's ugly anyway,' said Susan.

1898
02:43:58,279 --> 02:44:02,559
'Shut up, Susan,' said Timothy.

1899
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:06,600
In a voice that was a little 
higher than his ordinary tones,  

1900
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:14,600
Gregory said, 'Don't speak like that to 
my wife!' He half rose from his seat.

1901
02:44:14,600 --> 02:44:17,880
Susan said quickly, 'It's all right, Greg.

1902
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:19,040
I don't mind.'

1903
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:22,960
'But I do.'

1904
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:30,840
Helen said, 'George, I think it would be 
nice to let your uncle have the Spode.'

1905
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:41,000
And George, with a slight bow to Helen said, 
'Anything you want me to do, Aunt Helen, I will!'

1906
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:46,240
'You didn't really want it, 
anyway, did you?' said Helen.

1907
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:48,080
He laughed.

1908
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:53,640
'The trouble with you, Aunt Helen, 
is that you see things too clearly!

1909
02:44:53,640 --> 02:44:58,000
Don't worry, Uncle Timothy, the Spode is yours.

1910
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,760
It was just my idea of fun.'

1911
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:05,320
Timothy leaned forward angrily.

1912
02:45:05,319 --> 02:45:08,840
'You expected that Richard 
would make you his heir,  

1913
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:16,960
didn't you? But my poor brother knew where 
the money would go if you had control of it.

1914
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,960
You would have gambled it away.

1915
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:25,439
And he suspected you of being a crook, didn't he?'

1916
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:32,759
George said quietly, 'Shouldn't you 
be careful about what you are saying?'

1917
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:38,200
'I wasn't well enough to come here 
for the funeral,' said Timothy,  

1918
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:42,439
'but Maude told me what Cora said.

1919
02:45:42,439 --> 02:45:48,439
Cora always was a fool - but there 
may have been something in it!

1920
02:45:48,439 --> 02:45:52,599
And if so, I know who I'd suspect...'

1921
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:55,760
'Timothy!' Maude stood up.

1922
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:58,240
'You must think about your health.

1923
02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:01,920
Come up with me and go straight to bed.

1924
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:07,640
Timothy and I, Helen, will take 
the Spode in memory of Richard.

1925
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:11,680
There is no problem, I hope?'

1926
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:18,920
Nobody spoke, and she went out of the room 
supporting Timothy with a hand under his elbow.

1927
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:22,600
Michael Shane laughed.

1928
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:26,080
'You know, I'm enjoying all this!

1929
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:32,479
By the way, Rosamund and I want that 
marble table in the green sitting room.'

1930
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:35,279
'Oh, no,' cried Susan.

1931
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:43,080
'I want that for my new beauty salon - and I 
will put a great bouquet of wax flowers on it.'

1932
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:48,359
'But, darling,' said Rosamund, 
'we want it for the new play.

1933
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:52,639
It will be absolutely right.'

1934
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:56,600
'I see what you mean, Rosamund,' said Susan.

1935
02:46:56,600 --> 02:47:03,201
'But you could easily have a painted table 
for the stage - it would look just the same.

1936
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:08,639
But for my beauty salon I've 
got to have the real thing.

1937
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:12,201
We will talk about it tomorrow.'

1938
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:19,000
'This house is full of so many 
beautiful things,' Miss Gilchrist said.

1939
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:25,680
'That green table would look wonderful 
in your new salon, I'm sure, Mrs Banks.

1940
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:35,080
And wax flowers do look so right on that 
table - really artistic and pretty.'

1941
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:45,080
Greg said, speaking again in that high 
nervous voice, 'Susan wants that table.'

1942
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:48,439
There was a moment of unease.

1943
02:47:48,439 --> 02:47:58,639
Helen said quickly, 'And what do you really want, 
George?' George grinned and the tension relaxed.

1944
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:03,960
'Timothy's played the poor sick man for 
so long that he thinks only about what  

1945
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:10,000
he wants and makes sure he gets it,' said George.

1946
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,560
'I don't believe there's anything at 
all the matter with him,' Susan said.

1947
02:48:14,560 --> 02:48:17,241
'Do you, Rosamund?'

1948
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:18,840
'What?'

1949
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:22,040
'Anything the matter with Uncle Timothy.'

1950
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:29,800
'No - no, I don't think so.' Rosamund 
was lost in her own thoughts.

1951
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:31,200
'I'm sorry.

1952
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:36,240
I was thinking about what stage 
lighting would be right for the table.'

1953
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:40,160
'A single-minded woman,' said George.

1954
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:42,559
'Your wife's dangerous, Michael.

1955
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,480
I hope you realize it.'

1956
02:48:45,479 --> 02:48:53,519
'I realize it,' said Michael seriously.

1957
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:59,400
Helen changed the subject deliberately, 
turning to her foreign guest.

1958
02:48:59,399 --> 02:49:05,279
'I'm afraid this is all very boring 
for you, Monsieur Pontarlier.'

1959
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:07,479
'Not at all, Madame.

1960
02:49:07,479 --> 02:49:16,080
I think it is the greatest honour that I am 
allowed into your family life -' he bowed.

1961
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:23,080
'I would like to say that this house 
will be perfect for my elderly refugees.

1962
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,960
What peace!

1963
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:30,000
I hear that there was also the 
question of a school coming here,  

1964
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:38,200
run by "nuns", I think you say? You 
would have preferred that, perhaps?'

1965
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:41,080
'Not at all,' said George.

1966
02:49:41,080 --> 02:49:48,720
'But what I do find strange is why they should 
all dress as if they lived hundreds of years ago!'

1967
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:54,360
'And it makes them look so alike, 
doesn't it?' said Miss Gilchrist.

1968
02:49:54,359 --> 02:50:00,799
'I got so nervous when I was at Mrs 
Abernethie's and a nun came to the door.

1969
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:04,480
I thought she was the same 
nun who came to the door on  

1970
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:09,319
the day of the inquest on poor Mrs Lansquenet.

1971
02:50:09,319 --> 02:50:14,840
I felt as though she had been following me round!'

1972
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:20,840
'They both had the same type 
of face?' Hercule Poirot asked.

1973
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:23,760
'I suppose that must be it.

1974
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:28,880
The upper lip looked almost 
as though she had a moustache.

1975
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:31,680
Of course it was very foolish of me.

1976
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:35,760
I knew that afterwards.'

1977
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:43,320
'A nun's costume would be a good disguise.' 
said Susan thoughtfully, 'even for a man.

1978
02:50:43,319 --> 02:50:46,080
It hides the feet.'

1979
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:52,279
'The truth is,' said George, 'you 
don't often look properly at anyone.

1980
02:50:52,279 --> 02:50:55,399
That's why there are such very 
different descriptions of what  

1981
02:50:55,399 --> 02:51:01,439
an accused person looks like from 
different witnesses in court.'

1982
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:09,040
Another strange thing,' said Susan, 'is that you 
sometimes see yourself in a mirror unexpectedly  

1983
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:18,760
and you say to yourself, "That's somebody I know 
well..." and then suddenly realize it's you!'

1984
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:23,080
George said, 'It would be more 
difficult still if you could  

1985
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:28,439
really see yourself - and not a mirror image.'

1986
02:51:28,439 --> 02:51:32,879
'Why?' asked Rosamund, looking puzzled.

1987
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:38,720
'Because nobody ever sees themselves 
- as they appear to other people.

1988
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:44,760
They always see themselves in 
a mirror as a reversed image.'

1989
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:47,880
'But why does that look any different?'

1990
02:51:47,880 --> 02:51:52,200
'Because people's faces 
aren't the same both sides.

1991
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:56,679
Their eyebrows are different, and 
their mouths go up at one side,  

1992
02:51:56,680 --> 02:52:00,600
and their noses aren't really straight.'

1993
02:52:00,600 --> 02:52:09,280
With a sigh, Hercule Poirot rose to his feet and 
said a polite good night to Helen Abernethie.

1994
02:52:09,279 --> 02:52:13,800
'And perhaps, Madame, I had better say goodbye.

1995
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:17,360
My train leaves at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

1996
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:22,120
So I will thank you now for all your kindness.

1997
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:27,160
You will return now to your villa in Cyprus?'

1998
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:33,200
'Yes.' A little smile appeared 
on Helen Abernethie's lips.

1999
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:40,399
Poirot said, 'You are pleased, 
yes? You have no regrets?'

2000
02:52:40,399 --> 02:52:45,479
'At leaving England? Or 
leaving here, do you mean?'

2001
02:52:45,479 --> 02:52:50,040
'I meant - leaving here.' said Poirot.

2002
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:51,279
'Oh - no.

2003
02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:58,359
It's no good, is it, to hold on to the 
past? We must all leave that behind.'

2004
02:52:58,359 --> 02:53:03,000
'If we can,' Poirot said.

2005
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:06,279
'Sometimes the past will not be left.

2006
02:53:06,279 --> 02:53:13,279
It stays next to us - it says, 
"I am not finished with you yet'"

2007
02:53:13,279 --> 02:53:18,559
'You mean,' said Michael, 'that 
your refugees when they come here  

2008
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:23,880
will not be able to put their 
past completely behind them?'

2009
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:28,080
'I did not mean my refugees.'

2010
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:31,920
'He meant us, darling,' said Rosamund.

2011
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:39,560
'He means Uncle Richard and Aunt Cora and the 
hatchet and all that.' She turned to Poirot.

2012
02:53:39,560 --> 02:53:41,880
'Didn't you?'

2013
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:45,560
'Why do you think that, Madame?'

2014
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:47,600
'Because you're a detective.

2015
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:48,440
That's why you're here.

2016
02:53:49,399 --> 02:53:56,759
NARCO or whatever you call it, is 
just nonsense, isn't it?'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2017
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:59,440
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

2018
02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:02,679
There was a moment of great tension.

2019
02:54:02,680 --> 02:54:07,880
Poirot said, with a little 
bow, 'You have great insight.

2020
02:54:07,880 --> 02:54:09,880
Madame.'

2021
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:12,880
'No,' said Rosamund.

2022
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:15,239
'I saw you once in a restaurant.

2023
02:54:15,239 --> 02:54:18,479
A friend told me who you were.'

2024
02:54:18,479 --> 02:54:22,919
'But you have not mentioned it - until now?'

2025
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:28,120
'I thought it would be more 
fun not to,' said Rosamund.

2026
02:54:28,120 --> 02:54:34,120
Michael said, 'My - dear girl.'

2027
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:36,479
Poirot looked at him.

2028
02:54:36,479 --> 02:54:38,879
Michael was angry.

2029
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:44,200
Angry and something else - worried?

2030
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:48,439
Poirot's eyes went slowly round all the faces.

2031
02:54:48,439 --> 02:54:55,559
Susan's, angry and watchful; 
Gregory's, closed; Miss Gilchrist's,  

2032
02:54:55,560 --> 02:55:05,520
foolish, her mouth wide open; George's, 
suspicious; Helen's, upset and nervous.

2033
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:09,041
He wished he could have seen 
their faces a second earlier,  

2034
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:14,760
when the words 'a detective' 
fell from Rosamund's lips.

2035
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:16,960
'Yes,' he said.

2036
02:55:16,960 --> 02:55:18,319
'I am a detective.

2037
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:24,880
I was asked to investigate 
Richard Abernethie's death.

2038
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:27,120
It would be good, would it not,  

2039
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:34,040
if you could be certain that Richard 
Abernethie died a natural death?'

2040
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:36,359
'Of course he died a natural death.

2041
02:55:36,359 --> 02:55:41,040
Who says anything else?' Susan asked.

2042
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:44,319
'Cora Lansquenet said so.

2043
02:55:44,319 --> 02:55:50,880
And Cora Lansquenet is dead herself,' said Poirot.

2044
02:55:50,880 --> 02:55:54,359
'She said it in this room,' said Susan.

2045
02:55:54,359 --> 02:55:56,559
'But I didn't really think...'

2046
02:55:56,560 --> 02:56:01,081
'Didn't you, Susan?' George Crossfield said.

2047
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:06,920
'Why pretend any more? You 
won't fool Monsieur Pontarlier!'

2048
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:11,200
'We all thought so really,' said Rosamund.

2049
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:15,960
'And his name is Hercules something.'

2050
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:18,439
Poirot bowed.

2051
02:56:18,439 --> 02:56:29,359
'Hercule Poirot - at your service,' he said, but 
his name seemed to mean nothing at all to them.

2052
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:34,599
'May I ask what conclusions you 
have come to?' asked George.

2053
02:56:34,600 --> 02:56:38,201
'He won't tell you, darling,' said Rosamund.

2054
02:56:38,200 --> 02:56:43,880
'Or if he does tell you, 
what he says won't be true.'

2055
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:48,239
She was the only person in the 
room who appeared to be amused.

2056
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:53,600
Hercule Poirot looked at her thoughtfully.

2057
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:57,640
Hercule Poirot did not sleep well that night.

2058
02:56:57,640 --> 02:57:03,880
He was anxious, and he was not 
really sure why he was anxious.

2059
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:12,319
In his mind he heard bits of conversation, 
saw various glances, strange movements...

2060
02:57:12,319 --> 02:57:22,759
Helen dropping the wax flowers when he had said - 
what was it he had said? He couldn't remember...

2061
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:30,080
He slept then, and as he slept he 
dreamed of the green marble table.

2062
02:57:30,080 --> 02:57:33,880
On it were the glass-covered wax flowers - only  

2063
02:57:33,880 --> 02:57:39,319
the whole thing had been painted 
over with thick, red oil paint.

2064
02:57:39,319 --> 02:57:48,120
Paint the colour of blood and Timothy 
was saying, 'I'm dying - dying...

2065
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:53,720
this is the end.'

2066
02:57:53,720 --> 02:58:01,040
The end - a deathbed, with candles 
round it and a nun praying.

2067
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:07,000
If he could just see the 
nun's face, he would know.

2068
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:13,359
Hercule Poirot woke up - and he did know!

2069
02:58:13,359 --> 02:58:16,880
Yes, it was the end.

2070
02:58:16,880 --> 02:58:23,720
Though there was still a long way to go.

2071
02:58:23,720 --> 02:58:31,320
Sitting in front of her dressing table, Helen 
Abernethie stared at herself in the mirror.

2072
02:58:31,319 --> 02:58:39,319
What was it George had said? About seeing 
yourself? That day after the funeral.

2073
02:58:39,319 --> 02:58:45,359
How had they all looked to Cora? 
How had Helen herself looked?

2074
02:58:45,359 --> 02:58:52,519
Her right - no, her left eyebrow was 
arched a little higher than the right.

2075
02:58:52,520 --> 02:58:57,041
The shape of the mouth was the same on both sides.

2076
02:58:57,040 --> 02:59:03,720
If she met herself, she would surely not 
see much difference from this mirror image.

2077
02:59:03,720 --> 02:59:06,760
Not like Cora.

2078
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:09,560
Cora, on the day of the funeral,  

2079
02:59:09,560 --> 02:59:17,240
her head tilted sideways - asking 
her question - looking at Helen...

2080
02:59:17,239 --> 02:59:21,800
Suddenly Helen raised her hands to her face.

2081
02:59:21,800 --> 02:59:29,640
She said to herself, 'It doesn't make sense...'

2082
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:36,040
'I'm terribly sorry to get you out of bed 
like this,' Helen said into the phone,  

2083
02:59:36,040 --> 02:59:41,120
'but you did tell me once to ring you 
up immediately if I remembered what  

2084
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:48,279
it was that made me uneasy when Cora 
said that Richard had been murdered.'

2085
02:59:48,279 --> 02:59:49,359
'Ah!

2086
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:53,759
And you have remembered?' Mr Entwhistle said,  

2087
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:58,640
no longer surprised at being 
woken at seven in the morning.

2088
02:59:58,640 --> 03:00:02,720
'Yes, but it doesn't make sense.'

2089
03:00:02,720 --> 03:00:07,120
'Was it something you noticed 
about one of the people?'

2090
03:00:07,120 --> 03:00:08,359
'Yes.

2091
03:00:08,359 --> 03:00:12,839
It came to me when I was 
looking at myself in the mirror.

2092
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:14,760
Oh...'

2093
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:21,720
Helen's little half cry was followed by a 
sound that Mr Entwhistle couldn't place at all.

2094
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:32,640
He said urgently, 'Hello - hello - are you 
there? Helen, are you there?'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2095
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:35,800
CHAPTER NINETEEN

2096
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:40,080
It was not until nearly an hour 
later that Mr Entwhistle found  

2097
03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:44,439
himself at last speaking to Hercule Poirot.

2098
03:00:44,439 --> 03:00:48,000
'Thank goodness!' said Mr Entwhistle.

2099
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:52,960
'I had the greatest difficulty 
in getting through to Enderby.'

2100
03:00:52,960 --> 03:00:57,239
'That is not surprising,' said Poirot.

2101
03:00:57,239 --> 03:01:00,599
'The receiver was off the telephone.

2102
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:07,480
Mon ami, Helen Abernethie was found by 
the housemaid about twenty minutes ago,  

2103
03:01:07,479 --> 03:01:10,839
lying by the telephone in the study.

2104
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:14,520
She was unconscious.'

2105
03:01:14,520 --> 03:01:17,680
'Do you mean she was hit on the head?'

2106
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:20,120
'I think so.'

2107
03:01:20,120 --> 03:01:23,359
'She was telephoning me at the time.

2108
03:01:23,359 --> 03:01:28,880
I was puzzled when our 
conversation ended so suddenly.'

2109
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:31,640
'What did she say?'

2110
03:01:31,640 --> 03:01:37,000
'She said to me some time ago that 
when Cora Lansquenet suggested her  

2111
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:43,880
brother had been murdered, she herself 
had a feeling that something was wrong.

2112
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:50,120
Unfortunately she could not 
remember why she had that feeling.'

2113
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:56,080
'And suddenly, she did remember 
and phoned you to tell you?'

2114
03:01:56,080 --> 03:01:56,960
'Yes.

2115
03:01:56,960 --> 03:02:02,200
She said she had remembered - 
but that it "didn't make sense".

2116
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:08,880
I asked her if it was something about one of the 
people who was there that day, and she said, yes,  

2117
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:16,480
she had remembered what it was when she was 
looking in the mirror - and that was all.

2118
03:02:16,479 --> 03:02:21,759
We shall have to wait until she 
recovers consciousness before we know.'

2119
03:02:21,760 --> 03:02:27,960
Poirot said seriously, 'That may be never.'

2120
03:02:27,960 --> 03:02:31,480
'But - that's terrible, Poirot!'

2121
03:02:31,479 --> 03:02:32,719
'Yes.

2122
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:35,840
And it shows that we have to deal with someone who  

2123
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:41,720
is either completely ruthless or 
so frightened that it comes to the

2124
03:02:41,720 --> 03:02:44,160
same thing.

2125
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:50,960
She is being taken to a nursing home where 
no one will be allowed in to see her.

2126
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:56,239
But now, there is something that I want you to do.

2127
03:02:56,239 --> 03:03:03,479
One moment.' There was a pause, 
then Poirot's voice spoke again.

2128
03:03:03,479 --> 03:03:07,599
'I had to make sure that nobody was listening.

2129
03:03:07,600 --> 03:03:14,880
Now, you will go to Forsdyke House, 
a nursing home in Bury St Edmunds.

2130
03:03:14,880 --> 03:03:21,000
Find Dr Penrith and ask him about Gregory Banks.

2131
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:26,600
Find out what kind of mental 
illness he was being treated for.

2132
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:31,480
And now - goodbye.'

2133
03:03:31,479 --> 03:03:35,799
Poirot heard the sound of the receiver 
being replaced at the other end,  

2134
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:42,560
then he heard a very faint second 
click - and smiled to himself.

2135
03:03:42,560 --> 03:03:49,840
Somebody here had been listening and had replaced 
the receiver on the telephone in the hall.

2136
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:51,600
He went out there.

2137
03:03:51,600 --> 03:03:54,121
There was no one about.

2138
03:03:54,120 --> 03:03:59,319
He went quietly to the cupboard 
behind the stairs and looked inside.

2139
03:03:59,319 --> 03:04:05,000
At that moment Lanscombe came through 
the service door carrying a tray.

2140
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:08,680
He looked surprised to see Poirot.

2141
03:04:08,680 --> 03:04:15,000
'Breakfast is ready in the 
dining room, Sir,' he said.

2142
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,720
The old butler looked white and nervous.

2143
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:22,040
'Courage,' said Poirot.

2144
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:24,640
All will soon be well.

2145
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:30,680
Would it be too much trouble to bring 
me a cup of coffee in my bedroom?'

2146
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:32,560
'Certainly, Sir.

2147
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:37,400
I will send Janet up with it, Sir.'

2148
03:04:37,399 --> 03:04:44,279
Lanscombe looked disapprovingly at Hercule 
Poirot's back as Poirot climbed the stairs.

2149
03:04:44,279 --> 03:04:47,639
The detective was wearing a brightly 
coloured silk dressing gown.

2150
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:55,319
Hercule Poirot was dressed by the 
time Janet brought him his coffee.

2151
03:04:55,319 --> 03:05:00,439
As soon as she had left the room, 
Poirot put on his coat and hat and  

2152
03:05:00,439 --> 03:05:06,519
went quickly down the back stairs 
and left the house by the side door.

2153
03:05:06,520 --> 03:05:12,560
Soon he was speaking to Mr 
Entwhistle from the post office.

2154
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:16,000
'Pay no attention to what I asked you to do.

2155
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,640
Someone was listening.

2156
03:05:18,520 --> 03:05:23,600
Now, to what I really want you to do...

2157
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:28,600
You must go to the house of Mr Timothy Abernethie.

2158
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:33,800
There is no one there but a 
woman by the name of Jones.

2159
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:38,840
You will say to Mrs Jones that 
you have been asked by Mr or Mrs  

2160
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:46,239
Abernethie to fetch a particular 
object and take it to London.'

2161
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:50,920
And what is this object I've got to get hold of?'

2162
03:05:50,920 --> 03:05:53,239
Poirot told him.

2163
03:05:53,239 --> 03:05:56,279
'But really, Poirot, I don't see

2164
03:05:56,279 --> 03:05:59,599
'It is not necessary for you to see.

2165
03:05:59,600 --> 03:06:02,480
I am doing the seeing.

2166
03:06:02,479 --> 03:06:09,279
You will take it to London, to 
an address in Elm Park Gardens.'

2167
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:17,080
Mr Entwhistle sighed, 'If we could only 
guess what Helen was going to tell me.'

2168
03:06:17,080 --> 03:06:21,680
'There is no need to guess, I know.

2169
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:30,920
I know what Helen Abernethie saw 
when she looked in her mirror.'

2170
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:34,279
Breakfast had been an uncomfortable meal.

2171
03:06:34,279 --> 03:06:40,439
Neither Rosamund nor Timothy had 
appeared, but the others were there.

2172
03:06:40,439 --> 03:06:47,799
'What I can't understand,' said Susan, 'is what 
Helen was doing telephoning at that early hour,  

2173
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:51,000
and who she was telephoning.'

2174
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:58,560
'She probably woke up feeling ill,' said 
Maude, 'and came down to ring up the doctor.

2175
03:06:58,560 --> 03:07:02,161
Then fainted and fell.'

2176
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:07,000
The door opened and Rosamund came in, frowning.

2177
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,960
'I can't find those wax flowers,' she said.

2178
03:07:10,960 --> 03:07:16,399
'The ones that were standing on the marble 
table on the day of Uncle Richard's funeral.

2179
03:07:16,399 --> 03:07:21,000
Lanscombe, do you know where they are?'

2180
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:25,239
'Mrs Helen had an accident with them, ma'am.

2181
03:07:25,239 --> 03:07:29,120
She was going to find a new glass shade.

2182
03:07:29,120 --> 03:07:34,880
They are in the cupboard 
behind the staircase, ma'am.'

2183
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,920
'Come with me, Michael darling.

2184
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:40,680
It's dark there, and I'm not 
going into any dark corners  

2185
03:07:40,680 --> 03:07:45,600
by myself after what happened to Aunt Helen.'

2186
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:50,000
'What do you mean, Rosamund?' Maude demanded.

2187
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,439
'She fainted and fell.'

2188
03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:55,479
Rosamund laughed.

2189
03:07:55,479 --> 03:07:56,919
'Don't be silly!

2190
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:58,920
She was hit on the head.

2191
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:06,920
You'll see, one by one we will be killed and 
the one that's left will be the murderer.

2192
03:08:06,920 --> 03:08:12,760
But it's not going to be 
me - who's killed, I mean.'

2193
03:08:12,760 --> 03:08:19,840
'And why should anyone want to kill 
you, beautiful Rosamund?' asked George.

2194
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:23,960
Rosamund opened her eyes very wide.

2195
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:28,800
'Because I know too much, of course.'

2196
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:35,520
'What do you know?' Maude Abernethie 
and Gregory Banks spoke together.

2197
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:39,600
Rosamund gave her an innocent smile.

2198
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:45,760
'Wouldn't you all like to know? 
Come on, Michael.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2199
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:47,440
CHAPTER TWENTY

2200
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:54,161
At eleven o'clock, Hercule Poirot 
called a meeting in the library.

2201
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:58,439
'Please listen carefully to what I have to say.

2202
03:08:58,439 --> 03:09:05,399
I have been a friend for many years of Mr 
Entwhistle's and he was very upset by some words  

2203
03:09:05,399 --> 03:09:15,120
spoken on the day of Richard Abernethie's funeral 
by Mrs Lansquenet and asked me to investigate.'

2204
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:17,359
No one spoke.

2205
03:09:17,359 --> 03:09:19,159
Poirot threw back his head.

2206
03:09:19,160 --> 03:09:24,680
'Eh hien, you will all be delighted 
to hear that as a result of my  

2207
03:09:24,680 --> 03:09:34,600
investigations - it is my belief that 
Mr Abernethie died a natural death.

2208
03:09:34,600 --> 03:09:38,720
That is good news, is it not?'

2209
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:42,240
They stared at him and in all but the eyes of one  

2210
03:09:42,239 --> 03:09:47,479
person there still seemed 
to be doubt and suspicion.

2211
03:09:47,479 --> 03:09:51,559
The exception was Timothy Abernethie.

2212
03:09:51,560 --> 03:09:56,400
'Of course Richard wasn't 
murdered,' he said angrily.

2213
03:09:56,399 --> 03:09:59,279
'Well, Mr whatever your name is,  

2214
03:09:59,279 --> 03:10:05,639
I'm pleased you've had the sense to come to 
the right conclusion, though if you ask me,  

2215
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:14,280
Entwhistle went far beyond his duty as Richard's 
lawyer to get you to come nosing about here.

2216
03:10:14,279 --> 03:10:17,359
If the family's satisfied...'

2217
03:10:17,359 --> 03:10:23,279
'But the family wasn't satisfied, 
Uncle Timothy,' said Rosamund.

2218
03:10:23,279 --> 03:10:26,840
'And what about Aunt Helen this morning?'

2219
03:10:26,840 --> 03:10:29,640
'Nonsense,' said Maude.

2220
03:10:29,640 --> 03:10:34,960
'Helen felt ill, came down and 
phoned the doctor, and then...'

2221
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:39,120
'But she didn't phone the doctor,' said Rosamund.

2222
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:41,880
'I asked him...'

2223
03:10:41,880 --> 03:10:46,680
Susan said sharply, 'Who did she phone?'

2224
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:49,760
'I don't know,' said Rosamund.

2225
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:54,720
'But I'm sure I can find out'

2226
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:58,480
Hercule Poirot was sitting in the summerhouse.

2227
03:10:58,479 --> 03:11:03,399
He had told everyone that he was 
leaving on the twelve o'clock train.

2228
03:11:03,399 --> 03:11:06,879
There was still half an hour until then.

2229
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:10,120
Half an hour for someone to come to him.

2230
03:11:10,120 --> 03:11:14,200
Perhaps more than one person.

2231
03:11:14,200 --> 03:11:21,040
He waited - like a cat waiting 
for a mouse to come out of hiding.

2232
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:24,840
It was Miss Gilchrist who came first.

2233
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:33,279
'Oh, Mr Pontarlier - I can't 
remember your other name,' she said.

2234
03:11:33,279 --> 03:11:39,679
'I had to come and speak to you, 
although I don't like doing it.

2235
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:44,160
I did listen at the door that day 
Mr Richard Abernethie came to see  

2236
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:52,479
his sister and he said something like, 
"There's no point in talking to Timothy.

2237
03:11:52,479 --> 03:11:54,639
He simply won't listen.

2238
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:58,000
But I thought I'd like to tell you, Cora.

2239
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:04,239
And though you've always liked to behave as if 
you are simple, you've got a lot of common sense.

2240
03:12:04,239 --> 03:12:09,760
So what would you do about it, if you were me?"

2241
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:13,560
'I couldn't hear exactly what Mrs Lansquenet said,  

2242
03:12:13,560 --> 03:12:21,680
but I heard the word police - and then Mr 
Abernethie said loudly, "I can't do that.

2243
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:27,320
Not when it's a question of my own 
niece." And then I had to run into  

2244
03:12:27,319 --> 03:12:34,960
the kitchen because something was burning, 
and when I got back Mr Abernethie was saying,  

2245
03:12:34,960 --> 03:12:40,720
"Even if I die an unnatural death, 
I don't want the police called in.

2246
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:47,560
You understand that, don't you, my dear 
girl? But now that I know, I shall take  

2247
03:12:47,560 --> 03:12:53,240
all possible precautions." 
And then he said he'd made  

2248
03:12:53,239 --> 03:13:00,399
a mistake over her marriage because 
she had been happy with her husband.'

2249
03:13:00,399 --> 03:13:03,279
Miss Gilchrist stopped.

2250
03:13:03,279 --> 03:13:09,000
Poirot said, 'I see - I see...

2251
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,520
Thank you, Miss Gilchrist, for coming to see me.'

2252
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:20,081
Miss Gilchrist had no sooner 
gone before Gregory Banks came.

2253
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:22,760
'At last!' he said.

2254
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:26,320
'I thought that stupid woman would never go.

2255
03:13:26,319 --> 03:13:28,799
You're wrong about everything.

2256
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:32,239
Richard Abernethie was killed.

2257
03:13:32,239 --> 03:13:35,679
I killed him.'

2258
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:39,920
Hercule Poirot showed no surprise.

2259
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:41,720
'How?'

2260
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:44,360
Gregory Banks smiled.

2261
03:13:44,359 --> 03:13:47,160
'It wasn't difficult for me.

2262
03:13:47,160 --> 03:13:53,639
I worked out how I didn't need to be 
anywhere near Enderby at the time.'

2263
03:13:53,640 --> 03:13:57,201
'Clever,' said Poirot.

2264
03:13:57,200 --> 03:14:03,200
'Why did you kill him? For the 
money that would come to your wife?'

2265
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:04,000
'No.

2266
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:05,760
No, of course not.

2267
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:09,120
I didn't marry Susan for her money!

2268
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:12,279
Abernethie thought I was no good!

2269
03:14:12,279 --> 03:14:14,559
He sneered at me!

2270
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:20,040
People can't do that to me and not be punished!'

2271
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:24,840
'A most successful murder,' said Poirot.

2272
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:29,800
'But why give yourself away - to me?'

2273
03:14:29,800 --> 03:14:32,760
'Because I had to show you 
that you're not as clever as  

2274
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:40,080
you think you are - and besides - 
besides - It was wrong, wicked...

2275
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:42,359
I must be punished...

2276
03:14:42,359 --> 03:14:47,040
I must go back there - to 
the place of punishment.!'

2277
03:14:48,640 --> 03:14:53,120
Poirot studied him for a moment or two.

2278
03:14:53,120 --> 03:14:59,160
'How badly do you want to 
get away from your wife?'

2279
03:14:59,160 --> 03:15:02,559
Gregory's face changed.

2280
03:15:02,560 --> 03:15:09,081
'Why couldn't she let me alone? 
She's coming now - across the lawn.

2281
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:12,439
Tell her I've gone to the police station.

2282
03:15:12,439 --> 03:15:17,359
To confess.'

2283
03:15:17,359 --> 03:15:20,759
Susan came in breathlessly.

2284
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:24,400
'Where's Greg? I saw him.'

2285
03:15:24,399 --> 03:15:25,160
'Yes.

2286
03:15:25,160 --> 03:15:31,319
He came to tell me that it was he 
who poisoned Richard Abernethie.'

2287
03:15:31,319 --> 03:15:33,559
'What absolute nonsense!

2288
03:15:33,560 --> 03:15:38,000
He wasn't even near this place 
when Uncle Richard died!'

2289
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,279
'Perhaps not.

2290
03:15:40,279 --> 03:15:45,479
Where was he when Cora Lansquenet died?'

2291
03:15:45,479 --> 03:15:46,759
'In London.

2292
03:15:46,760 --> 03:15:49,160
We both were.'

2293
03:15:49,160 --> 03:15:52,239
Hercule Poirot shook his head.

2294
03:15:52,239 --> 03:15:53,920
'No, no.

2295
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:56,600
You went to Lytchett St Mary.

2296
03:15:56,600 --> 03:16:02,960
My inquiries say that you were there 
on the afternoon Cora Lansquenet died.

2297
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:08,800
You parked your car in the same quarry where 
you left it the morning of the inquest.

2298
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:14,920
The car was seen and the number was noted.'

2299
03:16:14,920 --> 03:16:16,920
Susan stared at him.

2300
03:16:17,479 --> 03:16:19,000
'All right.

2301
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:22,399
What Cora said at the funeral worried me.

2302
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:28,759
I decided to go and see her, and ask 
her what had put the idea into her head.

2303
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:35,960
I got there about three o'clock, knocked 
and rang, but there was no answer.

2304
03:16:35,960 --> 03:16:39,279
I didn't go round to the back of the cottage.

2305
03:16:39,279 --> 03:16:43,319
If I had, I might have seen the broken window.

2306
03:16:43,319 --> 03:16:50,239
I went back to London without any 
idea there was anything wrong.'

2307
03:16:50,239 --> 03:16:55,639
'I know something of your 
husband's history,' said Poirot.

2308
03:16:55,640 --> 03:17:00,120
'He has a punishment complex.'

2309
03:17:00,120 --> 03:17:02,960
'You don't understand, Monsieur Poirot.

2310
03:17:02,960 --> 03:17:06,880
Greg has never had a chance in life.

2311
03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:10,760
That's why I wanted Uncle 
Richard's money so badly.

2312
03:17:10,760 --> 03:17:15,080
I knew Greg needed to feel he was someone.

2313
03:17:15,080 --> 03:17:16,840
Everything will be different now.

2314
03:17:17,560 --> 03:17:19,960
He will have his own laboratory.

2315
03:17:19,960 --> 03:17:24,160
No one will tell him what to do.'

2316
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:29,000
'Yes, yes - you will give him everything - but you  

2317
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:34,359
cannot give to people what they 
are not capable of receiving.

2318
03:17:34,359 --> 03:17:42,519
At the end of it all, he will still be 
something that he does not want to be.'

2319
03:17:42,520 --> 03:17:44,760
'What's that?'

2320
03:17:44,760 --> 03:17:46,840
'Susan's husband.

2321
03:17:48,359 --> 03:17:55,239
Where Gregory Banks is concerned 
you have no sense of right or wrong.

2322
03:17:55,239 --> 03:17:58,800
You wanted your uncle's money - for your husband.

2323
03:17:58,800 --> 03:18:02,920
How badly did you want it?'

2324
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:09,080
Angrily, Susan turned and ran away.

2325
03:18:09,080 --> 03:18:15,880
'I thought,' said Michael Shane, 
'that I'd just come and say goodbye.'

2326
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:23,920
'Your wife Rosamund,' said 
Poirot, 'is a very unusual woman.'

2327
03:18:23,920 --> 03:18:26,440
Michael raised his eyebrows.

2328
03:18:26,439 --> 03:18:28,639
'She's lovely, I agree.

2329
03:18:28,640 --> 03:18:32,760
But she's not known for her intelligence.'

2330
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:37,560
'She will never be clever,' Poirot agreed.

2331
03:18:37,560 --> 03:18:43,000
'But she knows what she wants.' He sighed.

2332
03:18:43,760 --> 03:18:52,440
'So few people do.' Poirot placed 
the tips of his fingers together.

2333
03:18:52,439 --> 03:18:55,719
'There have been inquiries made, you know.

2334
03:18:55,720 --> 03:18:59,120
Not only by me.'

2335
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:06,599
'You mean - the police are interested? And 
they've been making inquiries about me?'

2336
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:11,720
Poirot said quietly, 'They are 
interested in the movements of  

2337
03:19:11,720 --> 03:19:16,720
Mrs Lansquenet's relations on 
the day that she was killed.'

2338
03:19:17,960 --> 03:19:20,120
'That's extremely awkward.

2339
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:25,359
I told Rosamund that I was having 
lunch with Oscar Lewis on that day.

2340
03:19:25,359 --> 03:19:31,359
Actually I went to see a woman called 
Sorrel Dainton - and though that's  

2341
03:19:31,359 --> 03:19:38,719
satisfactory as far as the police are 
concerned, Rosamund won't be pleased.'

2342
03:19:38,720 --> 03:19:46,720
'I see - I see - and this Miss 
Dainton, she will confirm your alibi?'

2343
03:19:46,720 --> 03:19:50,280
'She won't like it - but she'll do it.'

2344
03:19:50,279 --> 03:19:57,479
'She would do it, perhaps, even if you 
were not having an affair with her.'

2345
03:19:57,479 --> 03:19:59,160
'What do you mean?'

2346
03:19:59,160 --> 03:20:01,720
'The lady is in love with you.

2347
03:20:01,720 --> 03:20:11,080
When they are in love, women will swear to 
what is true - and also to what is untrue.'

2348
03:20:11,080 --> 03:20:14,319
'Do you mean to say that you don't believe me?'

2349
03:20:14,319 --> 03:20:18,559
'It does not matter if I believe you or not.

2350
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:23,560
It is not me you have to satisfy.'

2351
03:20:23,560 --> 03:20:25,440
'Who then?'

2352
03:20:25,439 --> 03:20:27,719
Poirot smiled.

2353
03:20:27,720 --> 03:20:35,640
'Inspector Morton - who has just 
come out through the side door.'

2354
03:20:35,640 --> 03:20:40,880
Michael Shane turned round quickly.

2355
03:20:40,880 --> 03:20:43,920
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE

2356
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:50,359
'I heard you were here, Monsieur Poirot,' 
said Inspector Morton when they were alone.

2357
03:20:50,359 --> 03:20:54,319
'I came over with Superintendent Parwell.

2358
03:20:54,319 --> 03:21:02,199
Dr Larraby phoned him about Mrs Helen 
Abernethie and he's come over to make inquiries.

2359
03:21:02,199 --> 03:21:08,000
I wanted to ask a few questions - and 
the people I wanted to ask seemed,  

2360
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:12,199
very conveniently, to be all here.

2361
03:21:12,199 --> 03:21:14,920
Did you do that?'

2362
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:16,560
'Yes, I did.'

2363
03:21:17,199 --> 03:21:23,559
'And as a result someone hit Mrs 
Helen Abernethie on the head.'

2364
03:21:23,560 --> 03:21:26,200
'You must not blame me for that.

2365
03:21:26,199 --> 03:21:29,040
If she had come to me...

2366
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:31,000
But she did not.

2367
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:34,399
Instead she called her lawyer in London.

2368
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:39,679
Now, I will ask you, my friend, 
to give me a few more hours,  

2369
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:45,600
then I may be able to hand you 
a piece of solid evidence.'

2370
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:49,760
'We certainly need it,' said Inspector Morton.

2371
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:54,239
'Though we have our found out that 
two nuns were out collecting money  

2372
03:21:54,239 --> 03:22:00,319
and went to Mrs Lansquenet's cottage 
on the day before she was murdered.

2373
03:22:00,319 --> 03:22:04,040
No one answered when they knocked and rang - Mrs  

2374
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:11,040
Lansquenet was at the Abernethie funeral 
and Gilchrist had gone out for the day.

2375
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:19,080
The point is that they say they heard 
sighs and groans from inside the cottage.

2376
03:22:19,080 --> 03:22:29,760
So was there someone there? And if so, who? 
All the Abernethie family were at the funeral.'

2377
03:22:29,760 --> 03:22:36,080
'These nuns, did they return 
at a later date to try again?'

2378
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:40,880
'Actually, they did - on the day of the inquest.'

2379
03:22:40,880 --> 03:22:45,359
'That fits,' said Hercule Poirot.

2380
03:22:45,359 --> 03:22:50,160
'You will have noticed, Inspector, 
that the visit of the nuns was the  

2381
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:56,760
same day that poisoned wedding cake 
found its way into that cottage.'

2382
03:22:56,760 --> 03:22:59,880
'That's a ridiculous idea!'

2383
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:06,120
'My ideas are never ridiculous,' 
said Hercule Poirot.

2384
03:23:06,120 --> 03:23:14,880
'And now, mon cher, I must go in search 
of the late Richard Abernethie's niece.'

2385
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:18,920
'Now be careful what you say to Mrs Banks.'

2386
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:21,680
'I do not mean Mrs Banks.

2387
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:28,080
I mean Richard Abernethie's other niece.'

2388
03:23:28,080 --> 03:23:33,239
Poirot found Rosamund sitting 
on a bench by a little pool.

2389
03:23:33,239 --> 03:23:36,080
'I thought you'd gone,' she said.

2390
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:39,080
'It's past twelve o'clock.'

2391
03:23:39,080 --> 03:23:43,600
'I have missed my train,' said Poirot.

2392
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:48,121
'Do you know, Madame, I have been 
sitting in the little summerhouse  

2393
03:23:48,120 --> 03:23:53,319
hoping that you would, perhaps, visit me there?'

2394
03:23:53,319 --> 03:23:57,319
'Why should I? I had a lot to think about.

2395
03:23:57,319 --> 03:24:01,799
I don't often do much thinking 
- it seems a waste of time.

2396
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:04,360
But this is important.

2397
03:24:04,359 --> 03:24:10,239
I think one ought to plan one's 
life just as one wants it to be.'

2398
03:24:10,239 --> 03:24:13,679
'And that is what you are doing?'

2399
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:15,400
'Well, yes...

2400
03:24:15,399 --> 03:24:19,199
I was trying to make a decision about something.'

2401
03:24:19,199 --> 03:24:21,720
'About your husband?'

2402
03:24:21,720 --> 03:24:24,520
'In a way.'

2403
03:24:24,520 --> 03:24:31,520
Poirot waited a moment, then he said, 
'Inspector Morton has just arrived.

2404
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:34,880
He has come to get statements from you all about  

2405
03:24:34,880 --> 03:24:40,640
what you were doing on the day 
Cora Lansquenet was murdered.'

2406
03:24:40,640 --> 03:24:41,800
'I see.

2407
03:24:41,800 --> 03:24:45,840
Alibis' said Rosamund cheerfully.

2408
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:48,080
'That will be hell for Michael.

2409
03:24:48,080 --> 03:24:52,960
He thinks I don't know he 
spent the day with that woman.'

2410
03:24:52,960 --> 03:24:55,760
'How did you know?'

2411
03:24:55,760 --> 03:25:00,080
'It was obvious from the way he said 
he was going to lunch with Oscar,  

2412
03:25:00,080 --> 03:25:06,120
and his face always does something 
strange when he tells lies.'

2413
03:25:06,120 --> 03:25:11,559
'How thankful I am I am 
not married to you, Madame!

2414
03:25:11,560 --> 03:25:20,081
He is not, I fear, a very faithful 
husband?' Poirot suggested.

2415
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:22,160
'No.'

2416
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:25,199
'But you do not mind?'

2417
03:25:25,199 --> 03:25:32,279
'Well, it's fun having a husband that all 
the other women want to steal from you.'

2418
03:25:32,279 --> 03:25:35,239
Poirot was studying her.

2419
03:25:35,239 --> 03:25:42,719
'And suppose someone did succeed - in 
stealing your husband away from you?'

2420
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:45,600
'They won't,' said Rosamund.

2421
03:25:45,600 --> 03:25:48,840
'Not now that there's Uncle Richard's money.

2422
03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:51,440
He can finance his own shows.

2423
03:25:51,439 --> 03:25:53,679
And he really is good.

2424
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:55,360
Not like me.

2425
03:25:55,359 --> 03:26:01,000
I love acting - but I'm terrible 
at it, though I do look nice.

2426
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:05,199
No, I'm not worried about Michael any more.

2427
03:26:05,199 --> 03:26:09,800
Because it's my money, you see.'

2428
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:13,080
Her eyes met Poirot's.

2429
03:26:13,080 --> 03:26:21,760
'I think, Madame, that you must allow your 
cousin Susan to have the green marble table.'

2430
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:25,520
Rosamund's eyes opened very wide.

2431
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:29,240
'Why should I? I want it.'

2432
03:26:29,239 --> 03:26:30,399
'I know.

2433
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:35,279
But you - you will keep your husband.

2434
03:26:35,279 --> 03:26:42,040
And poor Susan, she will lose hers.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2435
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:44,960
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

2436
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:48,800
The telegram came about six o'clock that evening,  

2437
03:26:48,800 --> 03:26:54,840
and then Hercule Poirot gathered 
his audience and began speaking.

2438
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:57,600
'The puzzle is solved.

2439
03:26:57,600 --> 03:27:01,560
Let me first, go over the various 
points which were brought to my  

2440
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:06,200
attention by the excellent Mr Entwhistle.

2441
03:27:06,199 --> 03:27:11,800
'First, Mr Richard Abernethie dies suddenly.

2442
03:27:11,800 --> 03:27:19,600
Secondly, after his funeral, his sister 
Cora Lansquenet says, "He was murdered,  

2443
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:26,200
wasn't he?" Thirdly Mrs Lansquenet is killed.

2444
03:27:26,199 --> 03:27:31,279
Then Miss Gilchrist becomes ill 
after eating a piece of wedding cake,  

2445
03:27:31,279 --> 03:27:34,960
which was poisoned with arsenic.

2446
03:27:34,960 --> 03:27:39,800
That is the next step in the sequence.

2447
03:27:39,800 --> 03:27:44,960
'I have found nothing to prove 
that Mr Abernethie was poisoned.

2448
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:50,520
Equally, I have found nothing 
to prove that he was not.

2449
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:57,520
But Cora Lansquenet undoubtedly 
asked that shocking question.

2450
03:27:57,520 --> 03:28:01,081
And undoubtedly Mrs Lansquenet was murdered.

2451
03:28:01,080 --> 03:28:08,160
Now, the post van driver strongly believes 
that he did not deliver that wedding cake.

2452
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:16,319
If that is so, then the parcel was left by 
hand and though we cannot exclude a "person  

2453
03:28:16,319 --> 03:28:24,880
unknown" - we must consider those people who 
were able to put the parcel where it was found.

2454
03:28:24,880 --> 03:28:32,600
Those were: Miss Gilchrist herself, of 
course; Susan Banks; Mr Entwhistle and  

2455
03:28:32,600 --> 03:28:43,600
Mr Guthrie, an art critic; and a nun 
or nuns who called to collect money.

2456
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:50,200
'Miss Gilchrist did not benefit by Richard 
Abernethie's death and in only a very small way by  

2457
03:28:50,199 --> 03:28:59,559
the death of Mrs Lansquenet - and Miss Gilchrist 
was taken to hospital with arsenic poisoning.

2458
03:28:59,560 --> 03:29:08,920
'Susan Banks did benefit from Richard Abernethie's 
death, and in a small way from Mrs Lansquenet's.

2459
03:29:08,920 --> 03:29:12,760
She might have believed that 
Miss Gilchrist had overheard  

2460
03:29:12,760 --> 03:29:20,120
a conversation between Cora Lansquenet and 
Richard Abernethie which referred to her.

2461
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:27,519
Because of that she might have decided 
that Miss Gilchrist must be killed.

2462
03:29:27,520 --> 03:29:34,240
She did, after all, refuse 
to eat the wedding cake.

2463
03:29:34,239 --> 03:29:41,399
'Mr Entwhistle did not benefit by either of 
the deaths - but he did have considerable  

2464
03:29:41,399 --> 03:29:46,359
control over Mr Abernethie's affairs, 
and there could easily be some reason  

2465
03:29:46,359 --> 03:29:51,759
why Richard Abernethie should not live too long.

2466
03:29:51,760 --> 03:30:01,160
But - you will say - if it is Mr Entwhistle 
who was worried, why should he come to me?

2467
03:30:01,160 --> 03:30:12,680
And that I will answer - it is not the first time 
that a murderer has been too sure of himself.

2468
03:30:12,680 --> 03:30:15,360
'We now come to Mr Guthrie.

2469
03:30:15,359 --> 03:30:21,319
If Mr Guthrie is really Mr Guthrie, 
the art critic, then that clears him.

2470
03:30:21,319 --> 03:30:25,960
The same is true for the 
nun, if she is really a nun.

2471
03:30:25,960 --> 03:30:35,399
The question is: are these people 
themselves, or are they somebody else?

2472
03:30:35,399 --> 03:30:39,120
'And there seems to be a strange - pattern - one  

2473
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:44,920
might call it - of a nun 
all through this business.

2474
03:30:44,920 --> 03:30:49,720
A nun comes to the door of Mr Timothy 
Abernethie's house and Miss Gilchrist  

2475
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:54,080
believes it is the same nun 
she has seen at Cora's house.

2476
03:30:54,080 --> 03:31:02,760
Also a nun, or nuns, called here 
the day before Mr Abernethie died.

2477
03:31:02,760 --> 03:31:10,120
'Other features of the case caught my attention: 
the visit of an art critic, a smell of oil paint,  

2478
03:31:10,120 --> 03:31:21,160
a picture postcard of Polflexan harbour, 
and finally a bouquet of wax flowers.

2479
03:31:21,160 --> 03:31:27,239
'It was thinking about these 
things that led me to the truth.

2480
03:31:27,239 --> 03:31:33,199
Richard Abernethie died suddenly - but 
there would have been no reason to suspect  

2481
03:31:33,199 --> 03:31:39,679
murder if it had not been for the words 
said by his sister Cora at his funeral.

2482
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:43,760
You all believed them because Cora Lansquenet had  

2483
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:49,880
always been famous for speaking 
the truth at difficult moments.

2484
03:31:49,880 --> 03:31:57,600
'And now I come to the question 
that I suddenly asked myself:  

2485
03:31:57,600 --> 03:32:09,360
How well did you all know Cora Lansquenet? 
And Not well at all is the answer!

2486
03:32:09,359 --> 03:32:16,120
There were actually only three people 
present that day who really knew Cora.

2487
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:22,920
Lanscombe, the butler, who is old and 
almost blind; Mrs Maude Abernethie  

2488
03:32:22,920 --> 03:32:28,640
who had only seen her a few times round 
about the date of her own wedding; and

2489
03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:35,480
Mrs Helen Abernethie who had not 
seen her for over thirty years.

2490
03:32:35,479 --> 03:32:45,839
'So I said to myself: "Supposing it was not Cora 
Lansquenet who came to the funeral that day?'"

2491
03:32:46,920 --> 03:32:53,960
'Do you mean that it wasn't Aunt Cora who was 
murdered, but someone else?' Susan demanded.

2492
03:32:53,960 --> 03:32:59,080
'No, no, it was Cora Lansquenet who was murdered.

2493
03:32:59,080 --> 03:33:06,239
But it was not Cora Lansquenet 
who came to the funeral.

2494
03:33:06,239 --> 03:33:11,399
The woman who came that day came for 
one purpose only - to create in the  

2495
03:33:11,399 --> 03:33:19,960
minds of his relations the idea that 
Richard Abernethie had been murdered!'

2496
03:33:19,960 --> 03:33:25,080
'Why? What was the point of it?' Maude asked.

2497
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:34,160
'To draw attention away from the murder of 
Cora Lansquenet herself For if Cora says  

2498
03:33:34,160 --> 03:33:38,800
that Richard has been murdered, and 
the next day she herself is killed,  

2499
03:33:38,800 --> 03:33:44,720
then her death will be believed 
to be the result of what she said.

2500
03:33:44,720 --> 03:33:52,080
But if Cora had simply been murdered without 
making her comment about Richard's death,  

2501
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:57,080
and if the "robbery" did not convince the police,  

2502
03:33:57,080 --> 03:34:05,960
then suspicion would be likely to fall on 
the woman who shared the house with her.'

2503
03:34:05,960 --> 03:34:11,520
Miss Gilchrist protested, 'Oh really, 
you don't suggest I'd commit a murder  

2504
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:15,720
for a piece of jewellery and 
a few worthless watercolours?'

2505
03:34:17,560 --> 03:34:20,560
'No,' said Poirot.

2506
03:34:20,560 --> 03:34:28,320
'But one of those watercolours represented 
Polflexan harbour which, as Mrs Banks realized,  

2507
03:34:28,319 --> 03:34:35,960
had been copied from a picture postcard 
which showed the old pier still in position.

2508
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:42,520
Yet Mrs Lansquenet painted always from life.

2509
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:50,480
Mr Entwhistle had mentioned there being 
a smell of oil paint in the cottage.

2510
03:34:50,479 --> 03:35:01,759
You can paint, can't you, Miss Gilchrist? And 
you had been painting over another picture.

2511
03:35:01,760 --> 03:35:04,560
You know a lot about painting.

2512
03:35:04,560 --> 03:35:14,121
Supposing that one of the pictures that Cora 
bought at a sale was a really valuable one.

2513
03:35:14,120 --> 03:35:22,160
Supposing that she did not 
recognize it, but that you did.

2514
03:35:22,160 --> 03:35:27,639
You knew she was expecting a visit 
from a well-known art critic.

2515
03:35:27,640 --> 03:35:35,560
Then her brother died suddenly - 
and a plan comes into your head.

2516
03:35:35,560 --> 03:35:41,280
It was easy to put a sleeping drug in her 
morning tea that would keep her unconscious  

2517
03:35:41,279 --> 03:35:48,840
for the whole of the day of the funeral 
whilst you played her part at Enderby.

2518
03:35:48,840 --> 03:35:51,840
She talked a lot about her 
childhood days so it was  

2519
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:57,840
easy for you to "remember" incidents and objects.

2520
03:35:57,840 --> 03:36:05,480
You were wearing Cora's clothes, with padding 
to make you look larger, and a false fringe.

2521
03:36:05,479 --> 03:36:14,719
And Cora had certain mannerisms, all of which 
you had practised carefully before a mirror.

2522
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:24,480
'But you forgot that a mirror image is reversed.

2523
03:36:24,479 --> 03:36:30,399
When you saw in the glass the perfect 
reproduction of Cora's sideways movement  

2524
03:36:30,399 --> 03:36:40,679
of the head, you didn't realize that 
it was actually the wrong way round.

2525
03:36:40,680 --> 03:36:44,000
You saw Cora tilting her head to the right - but  

2526
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:51,319
your own head was tilted to the left 
to produce that effect in the mirror.

2527
03:36:51,319 --> 03:36:59,479
'That was what puzzled Helen Abernethie at the 
moment when you asked your famous question.

2528
03:36:59,479 --> 03:37:04,359
Something seemed to her "wrong".

2529
03:37:04,359 --> 03:37:07,719
I realized myself the other 
night when Rosamund Shane  

2530
03:37:07,720 --> 03:37:14,240
made an unexpected comment about 
what happens on such an occasion.

2531
03:37:14,239 --> 03:37:18,080
Everybody looks at the speaker.

2532
03:37:18,080 --> 03:37:26,640
After the talk about mirror images, I think 
Helen Abernethie experimented before her mirror.

2533
03:37:26,640 --> 03:37:32,600
She probably thought of Cora, remembered 
how Cora used to tilt her head to the right,  

2534
03:37:32,600 --> 03:37:36,280
did so, and looked in the 
mirror - when, of course,  

2535
03:37:36,279 --> 03:37:42,759
she realized just what had been 
wrong on the day of the funeral.

2536
03:37:42,760 --> 03:37:49,320
She was determined to tell Mr Entwhistle of 
her discovery as soon as she woke next morning.

2537
03:37:49,319 --> 03:37:59,799
But someone who was used to getting up early 
followed her downstairs and hit her on the head.

2538
03:37:59,800 --> 03:38:07,520
'I may as well tell you now that 
Mrs Abernethie is not seriously ill.

2539
03:38:07,520 --> 03:38:12,000
She will soon be able to tell us her own story.

2540
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:15,800
That aside, at any moment you 
were prepared to admit that you  

2541
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:19,480
had listened to a conversation 
between Richard and his sister.

2542
03:38:19,479 --> 03:38:26,679
What he actually told her, no doubt, was 
the fact that he had not long to live,  

2543
03:38:26,680 --> 03:38:34,120
and that explains a phrase in the letter 
he wrote to her after getting home.

2544
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:39,080
The "nun" was another of your suggestions.

2545
03:38:39,080 --> 03:38:43,640
The nuns who called at the cottage on 
the day of the inquest suggested to you  

2546
03:38:43,640 --> 03:38:49,880
a mention of a nun who was "following 
you round", and you used that when you  

2547
03:38:49,880 --> 03:38:57,359
were anxious to hear what Maude Abernethie 
was saying to her sister-in-law at Enderby.

2548
03:38:57,359 --> 03:39:02,399
And also because you wished to 
go with her there and find out  

2549
03:39:02,399 --> 03:39:07,559
for yourself just what suspicions there were.

2550
03:39:07,560 --> 03:39:13,161
To poison yourself, badly but not fatally,  

2551
03:39:13,160 --> 03:39:22,680
with arsenic, is a very old trick- and 
made Inspector Morton suspicious of you.'

2552
03:39:22,680 --> 03:39:25,800
'But the picture?' said Rosamund.

2553
03:39:25,800 --> 03:39:28,520
'What was it?'

2554
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:33,240
Poirot slowly unfolded a telegram.

2555
03:39:33,239 --> 03:39:39,080
'This morning Mr Entwhistle went 
to Mr Timothy Abernethie's house  

2556
03:39:39,080 --> 03:39:44,199
to look among the pictures 
in Miss Gilchrist's room.

2557
03:39:44,199 --> 03:39:45,639
He was to take the one  

2558
03:39:45,640 --> 03:39:54,800
of Polflexan Harbour to London and go to Mr 
Guthrie whom I had contacted by telegram.

2559
03:39:54,800 --> 03:39:59,320
The hastily painted sketch of 
Polflexan was removed from the  

2560
03:39:59,319 --> 03:40:07,399
surface and the original picture was exposed.'

2561
03:40:07,399 --> 03:40:11,679
He held up the telegram and read:

2562
03:40:11,680 --> 03:40:15,760
'Definitely a Vermeer.

2563
03:40:15,760 --> 03:40:20,400
Guthrie.'

2564
03:40:20,399 --> 03:40:23,879
Suddenly, Miss Gilchrist spoke.

2565
03:40:23,880 --> 03:40:25,960
'I knew it was a Vermeer.

2566
03:40:25,960 --> 03:40:27,840
She didn't know!

2567
03:40:27,840 --> 03:40:34,120
She was always talking about Enderby, 
and what they did there as children.

2568
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:38,800
You don't know how boring it is, 
listening to somebody saying the  

2569
03:40:38,800 --> 03:40:45,320
same things, hour after hour and day after day.

2570
03:40:45,319 --> 03:40:49,279
Boring - boring - boring.

2571
03:40:49,279 --> 03:40:52,639
And nothing to look forward to.

2572
03:40:52,640 --> 03:40:56,840
And then - a Vermeer!

2573
03:40:56,840 --> 03:41:04,040
Another Vermeer sold recently 
for over five thousand pounds!'

2574
03:41:04,040 --> 03:41:12,560
'You killed her for five thousand 
pounds?' Susan's voice was shocked.

2575
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:19,380
'Five thousand pounds,' said Poirot, 
'would have paid for a tearoom...'

2576
03:41:20,600 --> 03:41:25,840
'At least,' Miss Gilchrist said, 'you understand.

2577
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:29,279
I was going to call it the Palm Tree.

2578
03:41:29,279 --> 03:41:38,479
And have wooden tables - and little chairs 
with striped red and white cushions...'

2579
03:41:38,479 --> 03:41:42,519
For a few moments, the 
tearoom that would never be,  

2580
03:41:42,520 --> 03:41:45,240
seemed more real than the sitting room at Enderby.

2581
03:41:47,159 --> 03:41:54,120
It was Inspector Morton who broke the silence 
by asking Miss Gilchrist to go with him.

2582
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:57,319
'Oh, certainly,' she said.

2583
03:41:57,319 --> 03:42:00,120
'I don't want to give any trouble.

2584
03:42:00,120 --> 03:42:10,760
After all, if I can't have the Palm Tree, 
nothing really seems to matter very much...'

2585
03:42:10,760 --> 03:42:15,400
She went out of the room with 
him and Susan said, her voice  

2586
03:42:15,399 --> 03:42:22,519
still shaken, 'I've never 
imagined a ladylike murderer.

2587
03:42:22,520 --> 03:42:26,121
It's horrible...'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2588
03:42:26,120 --> 03:42:29,319
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE

2589
03:42:29,319 --> 03:42:37,359
'But I don't understand the connection between the 
wax flowers and the marble table,' said Rosamund.

2590
03:42:37,359 --> 03:42:43,920
They were at Helen's flat and Rosamund 
and Poirot were having tea with her.

2591
03:42:43,920 --> 03:42:45,120
'The table, no.

2592
03:42:46,279 --> 03:42:54,239
But Miss Gilchrist said how nice the wax 
flowers looked on the green marble table.

2593
03:42:54,239 --> 03:42:57,439
And she could not have seen them there.

2594
03:42:57,439 --> 03:43:02,399
Because they had been broken 
and put away before she arrived.

2595
03:43:02,399 --> 03:43:11,199
So she could only have seen them when 
she was there as Cora Lansquenet.'

2596
03:43:11,199 --> 03:43:15,120
'That was stupid of her, 
wasn't it?' said Rosamund.

2597
03:43:16,479 --> 03:43:19,559
Poirot shook a finger at her.

2598
03:43:19,560 --> 03:43:25,600
'It shows you, Madame, the 
dangers of conversations.

2599
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:32,160
It is a strong belief of mine that if you can 
get a person to talk to you for long enough,  

2600
03:43:32,159 --> 03:43:41,800
on any subject whatever - sooner or 
later they will give themselves away.

2601
03:43:41,800 --> 03:43:45,120
Miss Gilchrist did.'

2602
03:43:45,120 --> 03:43:50,040
'I shall have to be careful,' 
said Rosamund thoughtfully.

2603
03:43:50,040 --> 03:43:53,840
'Did you know? I'm going to have a baby.

2604
03:43:53,840 --> 03:43:58,640
And I've decided to leave the 
stage and just be a mother.

2605
03:43:58,640 --> 03:44:01,280
Michael is delighted.

2606
03:44:01,279 --> 03:44:03,960
I didn't really think he would be.

2607
03:44:03,960 --> 03:44:07,199
So Susan's got the marble table.

2608
03:44:07,199 --> 03:44:11,279
I thought, as I was having a baby...'

2609
03:44:11,279 --> 03:44:15,159
She left the sentence unfinished.

2610
03:44:15,159 --> 03:44:22,519
'I think Susan is going to have a big success 
with her beauty business,' said Helen.

2611
03:44:22,520 --> 03:44:29,400
'Yes, she was born to succeed,' said Poirot.

2612
03:44:29,399 --> 03:44:33,359
'Greg's gone away somewhere,' said Rosamund.

2613
03:44:33,359 --> 03:44:37,719
'He's having a rest cure, Susan says.'

2614
03:44:37,720 --> 03:44:40,800
Poirot turned to Helen.

2615
03:44:40,800 --> 03:44:45,040
'And you, Madame, are off to Cyprus?'

2616
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:48,880
'Yes, in two weeks.'

2617
03:44:48,880 --> 03:44:53,880
'Then let me wish you a happy journey.'

2618
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:59,600
She went with him to the door, 
and said, 'Monsieur Poirot,  

2619
03:44:59,600 --> 03:45:07,040
the income Richard left me meant more to 
me than theirs did to any of the others.

2620
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:12,720
You see - there is a child in Cyprus...

2621
03:45:12,720 --> 03:45:18,640
After my husband died, my 
loneliness was unbelievable  

2622
03:45:18,640 --> 03:45:25,480
and when I was nursing in London at 
the end of the war, I met someone...

2623
03:45:25,479 --> 03:45:34,679
We lived together for a little while, then he went 
back to Canada - to his wife and his children.

2624
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:39,600
He never knew about - our child.

2625
03:45:39,600 --> 03:45:47,920
It seemed like a miracle to me - a middle-aged 
woman with everything seemingly behind her.

2626
03:45:47,920 --> 03:45:54,640
Now, with Richard's money, I can send 
my "nephew" to an even better school,  

2627
03:45:54,640 --> 03:45:58,440
and give him a start in life.

2628
03:45:58,439 --> 03:46:01,080
I never told Richard.

2629
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:06,479
He was fond of me - but he 
would not have understood.

2630
03:46:06,479 --> 03:46:11,679
I wanted you to know this about me.'

2631
03:46:11,680 --> 03:46:14,920
Poirot bowed over her hand.

2632
03:46:16,239 --> 03:46:22,040
He got home to find someone sitting in 
the armchair on the left of the fireplace.

2633
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:25,840
'Hello, Poirot,' said Mr Entwhistle.

2634
03:46:25,840 --> 03:46:28,400
'I've just come back from the trial.

2635
03:46:28,399 --> 03:46:31,879
They brought in a verdict of guilty, of course.

2636
03:46:31,880 --> 03:46:34,720
But Miss Gilchrist is happy, you know.

2637
03:46:34,720 --> 03:46:41,280
She spends most of her time making 
plans to run a chain of tearooms.'

2638
03:46:41,279 --> 03:46:48,759
'Some people might think that she was 
always a little mad,' said Poirot.

2639
03:46:48,760 --> 03:46:53,120
'But me, I think not.'

2640
03:46:53,120 --> 03:46:55,479
'Goodness me, no, Poirot!

2641
03:46:55,479 --> 03:47:03,679
She was as sane as you and I when she planned 
Cora's murder and carried it out in cold blood.'

2642
03:47:03,680 --> 03:47:07,159
Poirot gave a little shiver.

2643
03:47:07,159 --> 03:47:15,120
'I am thinking,' he said, 'of some words 
that Susan Banks said - that she had  

2644
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:20,840
never imagined a ladylike murderer.'

2645
03:47:20,840 --> 03:47:24,360
'Why not?' said Mr Entwhistle.

2646
03:47:24,359 --> 03:47:28,839
'It takes all sorts.'

2647
03:47:28,840 --> 03:47:34,000
They were silent - and Poirot 
thought of murderers he had known.
