CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,570
Sir Brangwyn

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:12,470
Rhiannon lived in the days of King Arthur
and his knights in the part of Britain, which

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,120
is now England.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,740
She was twelve years old and had long red
hair and green eyes.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,720
She lived with her mother and father in a
small village near Sir Brangwyn's castle.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:36,570
Sir Brangwyn was the lord of the castle and
the village, and everyone was afraid of him.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:44,070
He was a big, fat man with black hair and
cold, black eyes.

9
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,120
He was bad and greedy.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,860
He always wanted more taxes from the poor
people of the village.

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,450
Simon Grimstone was Rhiannon's father, and
he was brave and kind.

12
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,420
He was a tall, thin man with blond hair and
kind brown eyes.

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,110
The people of the village liked Simon because
he always helped them.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,710
He was not afraid of Sir Brangwyn.

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,799
One day Sir Brangwyn and his knights rode
to the village and stopped in front of Simon's

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,079
house.

17
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,650
'Simon Grimstone!'

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,070
cried Sir Brangwyn.

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,190
'You killed a deer in my forest!

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,970
No one can go into my forest!

21
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,390
My men are taking you to prison.'

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,290
'That's not true!' said Simon.

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,500
'I didn't go into your forest and I didn't
kill a deer.'

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,170
'Take him to prison!' said Sir Brangwyn to
his men.

25
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,329
'You want to put me in prison because I'm
not afraid of you!' said Simon.

26
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,469
'You're a greedy man.

27
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,490
The people of this village are hungry because
you take all their money.'

28
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,080
'Be quiet!'

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,160
cried Sir Brangwyn angrily.

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,250
'You'll be quiet in prison, Simon Grimstone!'

31
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,060
Simon's wife, Marian, was standing behind
her husband and started crying.

32
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,100
'Take his wife too,' said Sir Brangwyn.

33
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,569
'She can work in the castle kitchen and pay
for the food her husband eats.'

34
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:41,180
'Oh, please don't take me away from my daughter,'
said Marian, crying.

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,450
'There's no one who can look after her.

36
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,570
She'll be alone!'

37
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,800
'Please, don't take my mother away!'

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,209
cried Rhiannon.

39
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,470
But the Lord's men didn't listen to Rhiannon
and took her parents away.

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,440
'When can I see my parents again?'

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,060
she asked, crying.

42
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,750
The Lord's men laughed and rode away.

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,690
The villagers were angry but they could do
nothing.

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,599
After that day, they called Rhiannon 'Sir
Brangwyn's orphan'.

45
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,330
Rhiannon went inside her house and sat by
the small fire in the cold room.

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,640
She was very sad and lonely.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,520
'What will I do without my parents?'

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
she thought.

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,970
'I must find a job.'

50
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:43,300
Sir Brangwyn liked eating all kinds of food,
but truffles were his favourite.

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:50,080
It was very hard to find them because they
grew under the ground, on the roots of trees.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,340
Rhiannon decided to look for truffles for
Sir Brangwyn.

53
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,120
Now she had a job.

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,620
Every morning Rhiannon went to the forest
with a big basket.

55
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,400
She looked for truffles all day long.

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,720
At the end of the day, she looked in her basket
but she saw very few truffles.

57
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,350
'I only found three truffles today,' she thought
sadly.

58
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,190
'And Sir Brangwyn wants lots of them for his
dinners!

59
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,710
He'll be angry.

60
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,210
How can I find more truffles?'

61
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,430
At night, she always thought about her poor
father and mother.

62
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,620
Sir Brangwyn liked hunting in the forest with
his knights.

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,040
He often rode through the forest when Rhiannon
was looking for truffles.

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,440
He and his men always made a lot of noise
and scared the animals.

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,400
The villagers said there were strange animals
in Sir Brangwyn's forest...

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,639
like unicorns and dragons.

67
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,479
CHAPTER TWO

68
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,229
The Little White horse

69
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:13,039
Rhiannon continued looking for truffles in
the forest every day for a year.

70
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,729
One afternoon she heard a noise behind her.

71
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,330
She turned around and... what did she see?

72
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,610
A beautiful little horse!

73
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,960
It was white, and it had a lovely mane and
tail.

74
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,190
One of the villagers saw the beautiful little
horse that evening and he told his friends.

75
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:43,440
'I saw a young white horse in the forest and
it was following Rhiannon,' he said.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,580
'It was a very beautiful animal.

77
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,400
Perhaps we can catch it and give it to Sir
Brangwyn.'

78
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,090
'And pay less taxes!' said a young man.

79
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,289
'That's a good idea!' said an old woman.

80
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:07,020
The next day the men from the village tried
to catch the little white horse but it ran

81
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,480
away into the dark forest.

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,160
That evening Rhiannon came home with a basket
full of big truffles.

83
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,940
'Where did you find those big truffles?'

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,910
asked one of the men of the village.

85
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,050
'A friendly little horse helped me find them,'
said Rhiannon happily.

86
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,610
'Did you hear that, Richard?' said the man
to his friend.

87
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,340
'The little horse helped her find the truffles!'

88
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,040
The next morning everyone in the village went
to the forest to look for it.

89
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,440
'If we find lots of truffles we can use them
to pay our taxes to Sir Brangwyn,' said a

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,819
young man.

91
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:59,530
'Yes, and we'll have money to buy food!' said
a thin young woman with two hungry children.

92
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:05,819
They looked everywhere in the forest but they
could not find the beautiful little horse.

93
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,000
It was hiding in a secret place.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,639
When they went back to the village the little
horse came to see Rhiannon.

95
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,930
She followed him and found a lot of truffles
for her basket.

96
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:26,759
The beautiful little horse liked Rhiannon
and wanted to help her.

97
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,470
Day after day, Rhiannon's basket was always
full of truffles for Sir Brangwyn.

98
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:40,190
Soon the servants at the castle started talking
about the baskets of truffles and the strange

99
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,539
little horse.

100
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:49,650
One of Sir Brangwyn's knights heard them and
decided to follow Rhiannon into the forest.

101
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,490
He hid behind a big tree and waited for the
little white horse.

102
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,669
That evening he returned to the castle and
talked to Sir Brangwyn.

103
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:06,259
'Now I know why Rhiannon finds lots of truffles!'
said the knight happily.

104
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,720
'Oh, really?' said Sir Brangwyn.

105
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,750
'Tell me!'

106
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,199
'I was in the forest today and hid behind
a big tree,' said the knight.

107
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,960
'Then suddenly I saw...'

108
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,919
'What did you see?' said Sir Brangwyn.

109
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,039
'Tell me, quickly!'

110
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:29,250
'There's a strange little horse that lives
in the forest and Rhiannon follows him.

111
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,050
Then he stops and smells the ground.

112
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:38,209
That's where Rhiannon looks for truffles - and
she finds them!'

113
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,890
'What!' said Sir Brangwyn, surprised.

114
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,790
'A little horse that finds truffles?'

115
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,420
'Yes,' said the knight.

116
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,460
'And when the girl's basket is full she sits
under a tree and rests.

117
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,260
The little horse sits next to her and she
sings sweet songs to him.

118
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,490
But there's one strange thing about him.'

119
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,899
'What?' asked Sir Brangwyn.

120
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,470
'He has a lump between his eyes,' said the
knight.

121
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,080
'A lump... then it's a young unicorn!'

122
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,589
cried Sir Brangwyn.

123
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,899
'Soon that lump will grow and become a horn!

124
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,709
It's a unicorn - a magic creature!'

125
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,670
'A unicorn!' said the knight, surprised.

126
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,019
'I didn't know there were unicorns in the
forest.'

127
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:41,600
Sir Brangwyn called the best hunters in the
village to his castle.

128
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,160
'You are the best hunters in the village,'
said Sir Brangwyn.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,730
'Now listen carefully.

130
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:56,959
You must go to the forest and find the little
white horse,' said Sir Brangwyn.

131
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,020
'Then bring him to me.

132
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,380
There's a prize for the hunter who finds him
- a big prize.

133
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,170
Now go!'

134
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,870
The hunters went to the forest and looked
for the beautiful white unicorn.

135
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,490
They looked for days but no one could find
him.

136
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,500
Sir Brangwyn was angry and the hunters were
afraid of him.

137
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,079
One afternoon an old knight who lived in the
castle went to see Sir Brangwyn.

138
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:36,010
'Do you want to find the unicorn, Sir?' asked
the old knight.

139
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,600
'Of course I do!' said Sir Brangwyn.

140
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,079
'Then you must send the young girl into the
forest alone,' said the old knight.

141
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,440
'Alone?

142
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,589
But why?' asked Sir Brangwyn.

143
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:58,940
'When the unicorn sees her he'll go and sit
next to her.

144
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,980
She'll sing to him and he'll fall asleep.

145
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,540
Then the hunters can catch it.'

146
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,910
'That's a very good idea,' said Sir Brangwyn.

147
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,649
He called his knights and said, 'Go to the
village and get Rhiannon.

148
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,889
I want to see her immediately!'

149
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,730
The knights went to the village and looked
for Rhiannon everywhere.

150
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,050
When she saw them, she was afraid.

151
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,480
'What do they want?'

152
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
she thought.

153
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,060
'You must come with us to the castle immediately,'
said one of the knights.

154
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,579
'Why must I come with you?' asked Rhiannon.

155
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,390
'Sir Brangwyn wants to talk to you,' said
another knight.

156
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,070
'Get on this horse, quickly!'

157
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:58,450
Rhiannon got on the horse and went to the
castle with the knights.

158
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,600
CHAPTER THREE

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,070
Rhiannon's Secret

160
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,230
The knights took Rhiannon to the castle.

161
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,410
Sir Brangwyn was sitting at a long table with
his friends.

162
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,750
They were laughing and eating all kinds of
food.

163
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:25,110
'Young Rhiannon,' he said smiling, 'you must
help me catch the beautiful white unicorn

164
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,940
of the forest.'

165
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,589
'The white unicorn?'

166
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,240
asked Rhiannon, surprised.

167
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,260
'Yes, that little white horse is a young unicorn,'
said Sir Brangwyn.

168
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,380
'Then it's a magic creature!' said Rhiannon.

169
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,000
'When you are in the forest, you must call
him,' said Sir Brangwyn.

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,090
'He will come to you.'

171
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:58,410
'Oh, no!' said Rhiannon, 'The little unicorn
is my friend.

172
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,470
He loves me - I can't do what you ask.'

173
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,010
'You must do what I ask!'

174
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,350
cried Sir Brangwyn.

175
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,540
'I'm your Lord!

176
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,630
If you don't listen to me I'll kill your father
and mother!'

177
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,660
Rhiannon started crying and couldn't stop.

178
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,899
What could she do?

179
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,250
She felt terrible.

180
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:33,320
'Tomorrow morning we're going to the forest
to catch the unicorn!' said Sir Brangwyn angrily.

181
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,820
He looked at one of his knights and said,
'Take this girl away.

182
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,610
She can sleep in the hall.

183
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:48,750
I want to finish my meal now - bring in the
roast chicken and the truffles, quickly.'

184
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,130
Poor Rhiannon did not sleep all night.

185
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,690
Early the next morning Sir Brangwyn and his
knights took her to the forest.

186
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,970
Sir Brangwyn and his men hid behind some trees
and Rhiannon sat on the grass.

187
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,120
They waited all day and all night.

188
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,079
When the moon was high in the sky, the young
unicorn came and sat next to Rhiannon.

189
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,810
He looked at her with his big eyes and put
his nose next to her cheek.

190
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,500
He was happy when he was with his friend.

191
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,980
But Rhiannon could not sing, because she was
afraid and unhappy.

192
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,450
Suddenly Sir Brangwyn came riding through
the forest on his big black horse.

193
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:49,350
Rhiannon jumped onto the unicorn, put her
arms around his neck and quickly rode away.

194
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,279
Sir Brangwyn followed them.

195
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,080
The knights and the hunters waited for their
lord to return with the unicorn.

196
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,600
It was very dark in the forest and they couldn't
see anything.

197
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,970
But they heard the sound of horses and then
a loud cry.

198
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,759
They waited a long time but their lord did
not return.

199
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,470
Very early the next morning the knights and
hunters started looking for Sir Brangwyn.

200
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,089
After many hours, they found him in the forest.

201
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,959
There was blood everywhere.

202
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,279
The blood came from his heart.

203
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,780
'He's... dead!' said one knight.

204
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,730
'But who killed him?' asked another knight.

205
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,360
'I don't know,' said a young hunter.

206
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,850
Everyone looked at Sir Brangwyn's body, but
no one was sad.

207
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,260
His son Sir Ivor was the new Lord.

208
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,980
He was a kind, friendly young man and everyone
liked him.

209
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,210
He helped the villagers and the men in prison
were all free.

210
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:13,290
Rhiannon's parents finally went back to their
home and she was very happy.

211
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,570
'Rhiannon,' her father asked, 'who killed
Sir Brangwyn?

212
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,329
You were in the forest that night.'

213
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:28,600
'It's a secret, father - it's my secret,'
said Rhiannon, smiling.

214
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,819
'All I can say is this: unicorns have parents
too.'
