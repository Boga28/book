00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,700
CHAPTER ONE
New Life

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,710
"No, it isn't true!

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,280
It can't be true!"

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,119
Matt Johnson woke up.

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,680
It was that nightmare again.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,260
The same nightmare every night for six weeks.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,470
It was so real...

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,290
His parents are in the car.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,490
They're happy.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,640
They're laughing and talking about the summer
holidays; two weeks in Florida - Disney World,

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,750
Cape Canaveral, the ocean to swim in - a twelve-year-old
kid's dream!

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,450
Suddenly the car is out of control.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,890
Matt's dad is a good driver but he can't stop
the car.

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,430
It's going too fast.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,140
It's too late.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,850
There's a tree.

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,850
Crash!

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,030
A terrible sound of metal breaking.

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,130
Now there's silence.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,180
The car is upside down.

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,170
Only a wheel is moving.

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,220
It turns and turns and turns...

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,860
Matt put his head in his hands and cried,
like he did every night.

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,030
"It can't be true!"

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,810
But it w as true.

26
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,310
His parents were dead and Matt was alone now.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,100
"Cry, Matt, cry.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,680
Don't worry," said a gentle voice.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,040
The sad, kind face of an old lady appeared
in the light of the lamp next to Matt's bed.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,880
"I'm sorry, Gran," said Matt, and looked up.

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,960
In the lamplight was the pale face of a desperately
unhappy young boy.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,960
It was a nice face, but his blue eyes were
still full of tears.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,820
"I'm sorry," he repeated.

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,780
"Gran, when will I start to forget?"

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,749
"You'll never forget," said his grandmother,
"but one night your nightmares will stop.

36
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:20,999
Then you'll start to dream of the happy times
with your mum and dad.

37
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:24,799
Happy memories never die."

38
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,189
Matt's grandmother smiled.

39
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:33,299
She was a wise old woman and the ideal person
to help Matt at this difficult time.

40
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,620
"Let's go into the kitchen for some hot milk."

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,819
Matt got out of bed.

42
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:46,900
He was quite tall for his age and already
looked down on his little grandmother.

43
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,489
She was small but she had a big heart.

44
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,870
It was difficult for her, too.

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:01,669
Jane, her daughter, was dead and Philip, Jane's
husband and Matt's father, too.

46
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:05,189
But now there was Matt to take care of.

47
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:07,109
Matt was her world now.

48
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,379
"Will you like living here?"

49
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,199
she asked him, as they drank their milk.

50
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,650
"I don't know," answered Matt, tired and sad.

51
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,450
"It's so different.

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,370
I liked Newbridge very much.

53
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,730
It was a nice city, not too big, and the people
in the north are kind and friendly.

54
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,120
I had a lot of friends.

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,689
Greenwood's okay, but it's a very quiet suburb
and it's difficult to get to the centre of

56
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,449
London from here.

57
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:46,589
I haven't got any friends here, except you
Gran, and there's no Newbridge United, and

58
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:47,589
no swimming club."

59
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,089
"Poor Matt.

60
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:51,150
You'll see.

61
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,150
Things will change.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,040
There are a lot of football teams in London.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,999
There's a swimming pool near here.

64
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,249
And of course you'll make friends.

65
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,150
You'll see...

66
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,989
But now, Matt, it's time to go back to bed.

67
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,809
Tomorrow's a big day.

68
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:26,310
Your first day at your new school."

69
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,480
CHAPTER TWO
A New School

70
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,840
New School Greenwood Middle School or Greenwood
prison?

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,760
It was quarter to nine and Matt was outside
the school gate.

72
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,750
The gate was closed but through the iron bars,
he could see the school.

73
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,740
It was a big, old austere building made of
grey stone.

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,010
There were two floors with windows with iron
bars.

75
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:04,790
On the ground floor, there were three entrances
with doors made of wood.

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,040
Over the central door was the school motto
in big black letters.

77
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,490
It was in Latin.

78
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,280
"Fugerit aetas: carpe diem," read Matt.

79
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,900
"Time flies - live for the day."

80
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:30,460
Above the door on the left was the word "Boys",
and over the door on the right, the word "Girls".

81
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Matt smiled.

82
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,980
"That's stupid," thought Matt.

83
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,680
"Boys and girls have to go in different doors!"

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,120
Matt stopped smiling when he looked around.

85
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,740
A lot of children were now outside the iron
gate, all dressed identically.

86
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,800
The school uniform!

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,670
Now he remembered - at Greenwood, school uniform
was obligatory.

88
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:02,650
Matt, in his blue jeans, black trainers and
red Newbridge United football shirt, felt

89
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,260
very out of place.

90
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,530
All the other children were wearing their
green wool blazers, the boys with black trousers

91
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,220
and a white cotton shirt, the girls with dark
skirts and white blouses.

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,300
Then Matt noticed the green and gold school
ties!

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,360
"They wear ties to school too!"

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,490
he thought.

95
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,090
"Oh no!

96
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,780
This place is really behind the times."

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,550
He felt hundreds of eyes on him.

98
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,770
He wanted to go home but it was too late.

99
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,050
The gate was open.

100
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,320
The bell rang and the children starred to
go in, all talking and laughing.

101
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,890
They were happy to see their friends again.

102
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,230
Matt was very unhappy.

103
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,000
He felt very lonely.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,130
"Boy!"

105
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,680
Matt heard an angry adult voice.

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
He looked round.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
"Yes!

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
You boy!

109
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,090
Where is your uniform?"

110
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,120
Matt saw a short, thin man with an angry red
face.

111
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,040
"I'm sorry, Sir," he said.

112
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,070
"It's my first day."

113
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,360
The man, obviously a teacher, looked at him
carefully.

114
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,560
"From your clothes and your accent you must
be Johnson, the new boy from the north."

115
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
"Yes, Sir.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,030
Matt, Matt Johnson," replied Matt.

117
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:35,350
"Johnson, at this school," the man continued,
"we use surnames here, and I'm Mr Briggs.

118
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,940
Did your parents forget your uniform?"

119
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,230
Matt was hurt but replied, "My parents are
dead, Sir."

120
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,760
"Oh yes.

121
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,590
Now I remember that accident.

122
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,330
It was in the newspapers.

123
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,420
Your father was that famous lawyer.

124
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,680
Well, I hope you'll buy a uniform as soon
as possible."

125
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,770
And Mr Briggs went away.

126
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,200
Matt was devastated.

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,660
He didn't have the right clothes or the right
accent, and his dad, a hero for a lot of people,

128
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,919
now seemed an inconvenience.

129
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,340
He felt terrible.

130
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,800
He wanted to go back to Newbridge.

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,810
"Be careful!" said a girl's voice.

132
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,889
Matt turned and saw a pretty blonde girl smiling
at him.

133
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,780
"You can't go in here," she continued.

134
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,669
"This is the girls' entrance.

135
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,439
Mr Briggs will shout at you again."

136
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:37,669
"Thanks," said Matt.

137
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,229
"Hey, what's your name?"

138
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,089
But the girl was already inside.

139
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:56,850
CHAPTER THREE
A Bully

140
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,720
After a disastrous first day at school, Matt
was very unhappy.

141
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,290
"What's the problem?" asked his gran.

142
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,819
"Nobody talked to me, the teachers were horrible
and the lessons were boring!" he answered.

143
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:13,449
"I'm going to watch TV."

144
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:20,170
His gran smiled kindly and said, "Things will
change, Matt."

145
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,540
That night Matt didn't have his nightmare.

146
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,550
He dreamt of the blonde girl.

147
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,079
She was the only reason to go back to school.

148
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,430
The next day Matt went by bike to school.

149
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,800
It was a sunny day and the birds sang happily.

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,350
He arrived early.

151
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,519
"Perhaps today will be better," he thought.

152
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,740
He put his bike in the bicycle shed and walked
towards the boys' entrance.

153
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,800
Near the girls' entrance, he saw the blonde
girl from yesterday, talking to a tall boy.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:07,269
Matt looked at the blonde girl.

155
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:13,389
She had the same green eyes and pretty, round
face he remembered from his dream.

156
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:20,270
He thought, "She looks really nice, and she
spoke to me yesterday - I'm going to say hello."

157
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,360
As he came near, he saw the girl looking angrily
at Briggs.

158
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,110
He heard her saying, "No!

159
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,209
I don't want to watch your silly football
match!

160
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,999
Leave me alone!"

161
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:36,050
She went towards the entrance but Briggs stopped
her.

162
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,100
"Don't be stupid.

163
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,670
You must come with me.

164
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,550
It's an important match and I'm the captain
- and I want you there to support my team,"

165
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,319
he said, catching her arm.

166
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,839
The girl pulled away.

167
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,509
"Don't touch me!

168
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:53,050
I'm not interested in you or your stupid football
match," she shouted.

169
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,779
Her face was red and she looked very annoyed.

170
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,190
Briggs looked furious.

171
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,720
"It's not a stupid match," he said loudly,
"it's very important.

172
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,300
We're playing at the local stadium."

173
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,800
And he continued to hold the girl's arm.

174
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,910
Matt saw this.

175
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,499
He felt angry and decided to help the girl.

176
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:21,420
He walked towards them and said quietly to
Briggs, "Leave her alone - now."

177
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,189
Briggs looked at him.

178
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,110
He was surprised and released the girl's arm.

179
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,000
She moved away and looked at Matt gratefully.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,580
"Who are you?

181
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,680
What do you want?

182
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,649
Don't tell me what to do!"

183
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:37,519
Briggs shouted aggressively.

184
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,189
But Matt wasn't frightened.

185
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,619
He said calmly, "Go away.

186
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,600
And don't annoy her again.

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,079
She's not interested in you."

188
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:53,269
Briggs moved cowards Matt, but Matt was taller,
and he looked very determined.

189
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:54,750
The bully stopped.

190
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,259
"You'll pay for this!

191
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,209
I promise!" he shouted threateningly.

192
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:02,579
Matt didn't react.

193
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,410
Briggs turned and looked at the girl.

194
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,269
"I won't forget!" he said, and walked away.

195
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,480
The girl looked at Matt and smiled warmly.

196
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,449
"Thank you for your help.

197
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,720
He's a horrible pest, and he always annoys
me.

198
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,709
This time he was really angry," she said.

199
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,779
Matt smiled too.

200
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:24,779
"No problem.

201
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,490
Perhaps he will leave you alone now."

202
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,740
"I hope so.

203
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,910
Thanks again.

204
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,670
What's your name?"

205
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:38,779
she asked.

206
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:42,160
CHAPTER FOUR
A New Friend

207
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,449
"My name's Matt, Matt Johnson.

208
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,869
You spoke to me yesterday," he said.

209
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,689
"Yes, I remember.

210
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,009
My name's Linda Chapman.

211
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,370
So you're new here?"

212
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,370
she asked.

213
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,589
"Yes, yesterday was my first day at this school,"
he replied.

214
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:02,759
"I like your accent.

215
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,759
Where are you from?" asked Linda.

216
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,459
"I'm from Newbridge," said Matt, "but now
I live here."

217
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,139
"When did you arrive?"

218
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,290
Linda asked.

219
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,950
"Well, about a month ago, during the summer
holidays."

220
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,680
"I see," said Linda.

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
"Why did your family decide to move to London?

222
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,689
It must be nice to live in the north of England."

223
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:26,749
Matt looked embarrassed.

224
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:34,439
"Well, I live with my gran now, because my
parents died in an accident six weeks ago.

225
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,309
Gran is my only relative.

226
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,519
I haven't got any brothers or sisters."

227
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,949
Linda looked sympathetic.

228
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:44,949
"Oh, I'm so sorry.

229
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,559
It must be terrible to lose your parents."

230
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,089
She stopped for a moment, looking for the
right words.

231
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:58,339
"I know it's not the same, but my parents
divorced recently.

232
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:05,639
Now I only see my dad at the weekend and my
mum is a different person, she's always sad.

233
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,639
I hate it."

234
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,100
Matt saw her green eyes become shiny with
tears.

235
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,199
He wanted to see Linda happy again.

236
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,139
He decided to change the subject.

237
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,420
"What do you do after school?

238
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,769
Do you like sports?" he asked.

239
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:22,800
Linda smiled.

240
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,329
"Well, I like swimming."

241
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,600
"Do you?

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,870
Me too.

243
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,450
I love it.

244
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,839
And I like football too.

245
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,879
You don't, do you?

246
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,660
I heard you say that to Briggs."

247
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,860
"Oh," said Linda, "I like football if Briggs
isn't there!"

248
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,740
They laughed.

249
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,339
Time seemed to stop while they chatted about
their interests.

250
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,949
"My favourite hobby is playing on the computer,"
said Linda.

251
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,050
"I love surfing on the Internet.

252
00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,100
I spend hours sending e-mails to my pen-pals
in France and Italy, and I like looking for

253
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,029
interesting information for my school projects."

254
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:04,269
"That's great," said Matt.

255
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,509
"I like computers too, but I haven't got one."

256
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:13,050
"Well," said Linda, "you can come to my house
one day to use my computer, if you want."

257
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,269
"Thanks, Linda, that's great," replied Matt.

258
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,380
He looked at Linda, suddenly feeling shy.

259
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,940
Linda looked at her watch.

260
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,260
"Oh, it's nearly nine o'clock.

261
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,680
Our lessons start soon," she said.

262
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,970
"Ok, let's go," said Matt.

263
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,500
"Boys' entrance, don't forget!"

264
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
laughed Linda.

265
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,949
"Oh, Matt, where do you live?"

266
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:37,929
"I live in Boswell Street," said Matt.

267
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,569
"That's near my house.

268
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,379
I live in Simpson Road!

269
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:47,079
We could walk home together after school,
if you want," Linda suggested.

270
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,480
Matt smiled.

271
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,450
He wasn't embarrassed now.

272
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,040
It was impossible to be embarrassed with Linda.

273
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,709
He decided to leave his bike at school until
tomorrow.

274
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,769
"See you here at four o'clock," he said.

275
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:01,829
Linda smiled.

276
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:07,649
"I usually go to the newsagent's for a bar
of chocolate after school.

277
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:08,970
I love chocolate!"

278
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,029
she said.

279
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,149
"I prefer fish and chips!"

280
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,779
laughed Matt.

281
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,490
Linda laughed too and said goodbye.

282
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,699
Matt watched her go into school.

283
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,749
He felt very happy.

284
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:28,480
"Now I've got a friend," he thought.

285
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:40,119
CHAPTER FIVE
An Unusual Teacher

286
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:43,069
Matt went through the boys' entrance.

287
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:47,240
He went to the school office to get his timetable.

288
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,379
In the corridor, he saw Johnny Briggs with
some friends.

289
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:59,500
Johnny's friends were all boys and they had
the same aggressive expression as Johnny.

290
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,569
They looked at Matt as he passed.

291
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:07,450
Matt felt uncomfortable but he ignored Johnny's
sarcastic comments.

292
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,020
"There he is!

293
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,360
The new boy!

294
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,579
He thinks he's someone important, but he's
not.

295
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,650
I'm glad he's not in my class!"

296
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,459
Matt put his hands in his pockets and tried
to look unconcerned.

297
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,110
"You again!

298
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,590
Take your hands out of your pockets!" said
a voice.

299
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,350
It was Mr Briggs, Johnny's father.

300
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,630
"You haven't got a uniform yet, Johnson, but
at least try to look tidy."

301
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,280
Johnny and his friends laughed.

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,290
Matt felt embarrassed but he didn't show it.

303
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,930
"Sorry, Sir," he said.

304
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,640
"I have to go to class 2B, Mr Wells' history
lesson but I don't know where it is."

305
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,090
"It's up the stairs, first door on the left.

306
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,800
Lessons start in 2 minutes, so hurry up,"
said Mr Briggs.

307
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,750
Matt arrived at the classroom and knocked
on the door.

308
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,240
"Come in!" said a deep voice.

309
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,390
Matt walked into the room and asked, "Is this
class 2B?"

310
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:21,410
A tall, thin man with long, white hair, like
Albert Einstein, answered "To be or not to

311
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,120
be, that is the question!"

312
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,560
Everyone laughed.

313
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,990
Matt laughed too and was pleased to see Linda
there, at her desk in the third row.

314
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,510
There was an empty place next to her, so Matt
sat there.

315
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,170
Linda smiled and said, "Welcome to Mr Wells'
history lesson.

316
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,990
It's an experience!"

317
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,380
Linda was right.

318
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,860
Mr Wells was not a typical teacher.

319
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,980
He talked very fast and he gesticulated a
lot when he spoke.

320
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,260
His lessons were very interesting and fun.

321
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,120
No-one looked out of the window in Mr Wells'
class!

322
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,920
That day they studied medieval history and
the feudal system.

323
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,340
Matt was fascinated by the descriptions of
life in the Middle Ages.

324
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,810
Mr Wells introduced the class project, a study
of medieval castles.

325
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:32,040
"I want everyone to prepare for our visit
to Ducksbury Castle next month," said Mr Wells.

326
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,260
"It's a perfect example of a medieval castle.

327
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:44,060
You can look for information on medieval castles
in general or Ducksbury Castle in particular.

328
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,870
If anyone has a computer, they can use the
Internet to find a lot of information.

329
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,670
Tomorrow I'll show you how on my portable
computer."

330
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,880
"Matt, I've got an idea," said Linda.

331
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,820
"You can come to my house on Saturday.

332
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,000
We can surf the Internet and find material
for the project."

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,380
"Great idea!"

334
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,140
replied Matt enthusiastically.

335
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,650
On Saturday, Matt went to Linda's house.

336
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:19,150
They found lots of interesting information
on the Internet for their project.

337
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,850
Linda's mum was very friendly.

338
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:29,160
She made a delicious lunch - a main course
of fish and chips, and chocolate cake for

339
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:37,110
dessert!

340
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:44,190
CHAPTER SIX
The Class Trip

341
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,010
It was the day of the class trip.

342
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,260
Matt was very excited.

343
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,030
He was keen to see the castle, but the trip
had other advantages too.

344
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:03,070
No school for a day, no school uniform, no
school lunch, no Briggs, and all day with

345
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,150
Linda!

346
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,900
The doorbell rang.

347
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,910
"Matt!

348
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,940
Linda's here!"

349
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:16,120
"Coming, Gran," said Matt, putting on his
denim jacket over a red sweatshirt and jeans.

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,430
He went downstairs.

351
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,480
"Hi, Matt!"

352
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,250
Linda was wearing a blue tracksuit and trainers.

353
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,070
"Have you got your packed lunch?"

354
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,070
she asked.

355
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:31,510
"Here it is, Matt," said his gran, giving
him a plastic box.

356
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:38,960
"Cheese sandwiches, crisps, an apple and a
chocolate biscuit.

357
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,260
Buy something to drink at the castle."

358
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,840
She gave him a pound.

359
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,390
"Thanks, Gran."

360
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,160
"Have a lovely day, you two," his gran smiled.

361
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,530
"Thanks, Mrs Francis," said Linda.

362
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:00,060
"Matt," she continued, "you can put your lunchbox
in my rucksack."

363
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,360
"Thanks.

364
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,590
OK, let's go.

365
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,220
We mustn't miss the bus."

366
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,360
Ducksbury Castle was an hour from Greenwood.

367
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,950
The hour passed quickly, talking, listening
to the radio and watching the London suburbs

368
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,330
become beautiful open countryside.

369
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:28,330
The trees were a splendid mix of green, red
and brown under a golden sun.

370
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,880
A perfect English autumn day.

371
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
"Look!"

372
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
cried Linda, pointing out of the window.

373
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,420
"The castle!

374
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,560
We're here!"

375
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,540
"It's great," said Matt.

376
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,570
"I expected a total ruin."

377
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,390
"No, Johnson.

378
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,140
It's the best example of a twelfth-century
castle in England,"

379
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,190
It was Mr Wells.

380
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,780
"Listen, everybody!

381
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,340
This is Ducksbury Castle.

382
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,160
It's an English Heritage property and there
is a guided tour of one hour.

383
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,990
You are divided into two groups.

384
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,410
Surnames from A to J must go first, at 11
o'clock.

385
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,250
The second group, surnames K to Z, do the
tour at midday.

386
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,340
You must meet at the entrance 5 minutes before
your tour starts.

387
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,150
Now it's 10 o'clock and you are free to look
around the castle.

388
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,470
Remember your project work and think of intelligent
questions for the guide.

389
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,330
Also remember that you are responsible for
Greenwood School's reputation.

390
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,950
You must be good.

391
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,950
Enjoy your visit."

392
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,130
"That was lucky," said Matt.

393
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,850
"We're in the same group."

394
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,890
"I know.

395
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,490
Come on, let's look around."

396
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,310
They went into the castle.

397
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,190
"Mr Wells was right," said Matt, "it is in
good condition."

398
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:57,410
"Yes, if you close your eyes, you feel you're
in the Middle Ages.

399
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:04,900
I can imagine the castle full of brave knights
and beautiful ladies," said Linda dreamily.

400
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Matt smiled.

401
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,280
"You read too many fairy tales."

402
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,830
"Oh, Matt, I can dream, can't I?

403
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,640
Come on, it's time for our tour."

404
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,450
They started to run towards the entrance.

405
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,450
"Matt!

406
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,450
Linda!

407
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,240
I know you're enthusiastic but you mustn't
run."

408
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,430
It was Mr Wells again.

409
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,410
"Sorry," they said together.

410
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,880
"I'll see you later," he smiled.

411
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,520
Matt noticed that he had his portable computer
in its case.

412
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,050
"Matt," said Linda, "did you hear?

413
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,490
He called us with our first names!"

414
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,980
"Yes, that's strange, and why has he got his
computer?"

415
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,440
"Who knows?"

416
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
laughed Linda.

417
00:24:48,440 --> 00:25:00,640
"I'm more interested in the mysteries of Ducksbury
Castle than the mysteries of Mr Wells."

418
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,990
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Castle Tour

419
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,740
"Good morning, boys and girls.

420
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,500
Welcome to Ducksbury Castle."

421
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,980
The guide was a jovial, rotund man with a
large white moustache.

422
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,970
"Before I start any questions?"

423
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,330
Matt put up his hand.

424
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,330
"Yes, sir.

425
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,630
Why is it called Ducksbury Castle?"

426
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,730
"A good question!

427
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:32,250
Well, the castle is near the village of Ducksbury.

428
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,380
Near the village, there's a large pond, which
is the favourite home of a variety of ducks.

429
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,220
So, that's 'Ducksbury', the village of the
ducks.

430
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:49,220
In fact, Ducksbury Castle used water from
the pond for washing, cooking, drinking and

431
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,730
filling its moat.

432
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:59,120
Many castles had ditches around them, without
water, but a ditch with water, a 'moat', was

433
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,530
better for defending the castle.

434
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,250
You can see the moat is dry now.

435
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,410
Once there was a wooden drawbridge over the
moat.

436
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,800
They raised this to stop intruders.

437
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,930
Now we're at the main gate.

438
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,580
Once there were two stone towers, the gatehouses.

439
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:25,830
Between these was an enormous gate with iron
bars, the portcullis.

440
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,070
Now let's go inside the castle.

441
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,380
The walls were stone and ten metres high.

442
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,070
There were turrets and ramparts, like those."

443
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,820
He pointed to an intact section.

444
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:46,050
"Oh, I forgot to say the castle was built
in 1156.

445
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,140
It functioned as fortress and a home for five
centuries.

446
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,470
The lord of the manor lived in the keep, a
big stone building and the strongest part

447
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,970
of the castle.

448
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,180
The 'manor' was the distribution and cultivation
of the land.

449
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,300
The peasants from the village did the work,
but the land was the lord's.

450
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,610
The open space inside the castle was the bailey,
with a well and stables.

451
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,610
Now, any other questions?"

452
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,200
Stubbs, the class joker, put up his hand.

453
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,390
"Where are the toilets?"

454
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,390
The guide laughed.

455
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,180
"In the keep there were small rooms over the
moat with a hole in the floor.

456
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,160
But if you need to go, they're near the drinks
kiosk."

457
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,550
Matt and Linda both had questions but Mr Wells
appeared behind them.

458
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:47,320
"Listen," he said urgently, "I'm accompanying
the other group.

459
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,980
Can you take care of my computer?"

460
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,780
He gave it to Matt before they could answer.

461
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,570
He was very nervous.

462
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,090
"Thanks, kids.

463
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,380
See you later."

464
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,160
"He's strange," said Matt.

465
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,000
"Very strange today," answered Linda.

466
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,580
"Anyway, the tour's finished.

467
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,960
Let's go to the kiosk.

468
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,470
You can buy a drink and I'll buy some chocolate!"

469
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,390
Linda went towards the kiosk but Matt was
transfixed.

470
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,620
A strange noise came from the computer case,
an insistent beep.

471
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,400
He ran after Linda.

472
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,480
"I bought you a coke, and some chocolate..."

473
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,590
She stopped when she saw Matt's face.

474
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,690
"Listen," he said, "it's getting louder."

475
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,030
"Open it," said Linda excitedly.

476
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:43,750
"Here, behind the kiosk, nobody can see us."

477
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,640
Matt opened the case and the beep stopped.

478
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,380
"An alarm?" he asked.

479
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,280
"No Matt, look at the screen!"

480
00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:00,130
There was the image of an hourglass rotating
quickly, and the words "Press Enter to continue"

481
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,510
flashed blue and red.

482
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,660
"And now?" said Matt.

483
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,560
Linda pressed the Enter button.

484
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,790
Nothing.

485
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:17,090
"A Mr Wells joke," they thought, before an
intense white light exploded from the computer

486
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,180
and they disappeared!

487
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:33,120
CHAPTER EIGHT
Where Are

488
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,050
Matt was the first to wake up.

489
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,720
''What a strange dream!" he thought.

490
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,360
He stood up and looked around.

491
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,180
"Where am I?

492
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,340
And Linda...?

493
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,800
I was with Linda.

494
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,330
Where is she?"

495
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:53,430
It was dark but now he began to distinguish
his surroundings.

496
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,960
He was in the open air.

497
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,000
There was a cool breeze and he heard the noise
of sleeping animals.

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,180
There was a smell, too, of the animals and
of life in general.

499
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,210
People lived here, but what place was it?

500
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:19,140
There were stars in the sky above but he was
surrounded by walls of stone.

501
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,760
"The castle!

502
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,630
Of course!

503
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,820
Now I remember.

504
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:33,800
But there's something strange about it...
it's night... and where's Linda?"

505
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
"Matt!

506
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,340
Is that you?"

507
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,680
came a whisper from the dark, and Linda appeared
in the moonlight.

508
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,030
She was confused and frightened.

509
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,260
"Where are we?

510
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,760
What's happening?"

511
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
she asked.

512
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,180
"We're in the castle," said Matt, "but it's
different, and why is it dark?"

513
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,200
"I d-d-d-don't know," stammered Linda.

514
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,220
"Matt, I'm scared."

515
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,710
Suddenly a voice broke the silence of the
night.

516
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,970
"Who goes there?"

517
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,320
"It's a guard!

518
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,110
He's got a sword!"

519
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,270
whispered Linda, and instinctively they started
running away from the voice.

520
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,270
"A torch!

521
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,270
A torch!

522
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,270
Wake up!

523
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,270
Intruders!"

524
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,940
the voice shouted, and immediately the castle
was full of flaming torches, making grotesque

525
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,570
shadows on the walls.

526
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:32,020
In the torchlight, Matt and Linda saw that
the walls of the castle were intact.

527
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,590
It wasn't a ruin!

528
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,520
These people weren't English heritage guides!

529
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,060
But there wasn't time to think.

530
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,160
"Run, Linda!

531
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,260
Run faster!"

532
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,360
yelled Matt.

533
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,560
"Where are we going?"

534
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
cried Linda.

535
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,590
"Out of here.

536
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,590
Come on!"

537
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,370
But a guard caught Linda.

538
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,370
"Matt!

539
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,370
Don't stop!

540
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,370
Run!

541
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,370
Run!"

542
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,370
she shouted.

543
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,880
Matt wanted to stop, to help Linda, but in
front of him there was another guard.

544
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,170
He had a torch in one hand and a sword in
the other.

545
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,900
Matt ran up a staircase.

546
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,910
Up, up and onto the ramparts.

547
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,450
He noticed as he went that the castle was
all perfectly intact.

548
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,110
But now he was trapped.

549
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,120
There was a guard on the staircase and two
other men with swords were on the ramparts

550
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,620
to his left and right.

551
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,190
They were all very angry.

552
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,300
"The game is over, boy," growled the man on
the stairs.

553
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,520
"Oh, no it isn't!"

554
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,810
shouted Matt, remembering the tour around
the castle.

555
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,270
The moat!

556
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,610
The castle had a moat!

557
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:44,620
Matt jumped from the ramparts and hoped desperately
that his intuition was right.

558
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Splash!

559
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,770
He hit the muddy water of the moat.

560
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:54,710
The moon reflected on the water broke into
a thousand pieces.

561
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,180
Inside the castle, Linda stood petrified between
two guards with long swords.

562
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:08,630
A tall man with dark, angry eyes and a scar
on his right cheek appeared.

563
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:14,750
"And who are you?" said the man, observing
her closely.

564
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,440
"My Lord," a guard said to the man, "look
at her garments.

565
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:30,760
She must be a witch!"

566
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:50,350
CHAPTER NINE
A Lord and a Jester

567
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:56,780
"A witch?

568
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,000
Possibly.

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,810
But a witch so fair?"

570
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,490
The tall man looked at Linda and she trembled.

571
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,820
A guard said, "Lord Blackheart, there was
a boy with her.

572
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,740
He jumped from the walls.

573
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,399
We must find him!"

574
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,360
"Don't worry," replied the lord.

575
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,960
"Nobody could survive that fall.

576
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,180
He is probably at the bottom of the moat."

577
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,240
He smiled horribly and Linda felt desperate.

578
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,520
"Oh, no!

579
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,080
Matt can't be dead!"

580
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,630
she thought.

581
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,890
Lord Blackheart continued to look at her.

582
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,030
"A very fair maid.

583
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,310
Take her to the Great Hall," he ordered.

584
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,639
"I want to question her."

585
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,440
The guards pushed Linda towards the huge door
of the keep.

586
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,290
Inside there was an immense hall.

587
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,060
There were many flaming torches along the
walls but the room was shadowy and sinister.

588
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,920
There were also numerous long standards of
different colours and a long wooden table

589
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,090
in the middle of the room.

590
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,040
On the left, there was a very big fireplace
but no fire.

591
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,930
Linda felt cold.

592
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,890
"Leave us," Lord Blackheart ordered the guards.

593
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,760
Linda shivered with cold and fear.

594
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,080
She didn't want to be alone with this horrible
man.

595
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,460
"This isn't happening to me," she cried.

596
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,850
"I don't believe it - it's a nightmare!"

597
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,680
"Can a fool not sleep?"

598
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,930
a voice came from the shadows near the fireplace.

599
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:54,140
It was a jester in a red and gold striped
costume and a hat with bells on it.

600
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,290
He looked curiously at Linda.

601
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,130
"A maid was never made like this!

602
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,130
What a strange costume."

603
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,300
The jester smiled.

604
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,110
He had a kind face and Linda felt a little
better.

605
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,740
Lord Blackheart said, "My guards found her
in the castle.

606
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,080
Her companion is dead.

607
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,490
Is she not fair?"

608
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,880
"Fayre, my lord?

609
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,430
Are you hungry?"

610
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,570
"No, fool!

611
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,670
You don't understand me.

612
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,560
Is she not lovely?"

613
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,780
"I understand you very well, my Lord Blackheart.

614
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,500
You don't understand me."

615
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,840
The jester laughed and the hells on his hat
jingled.

616
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,590
Linda smiled.

617
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,960
"Enough!"

618
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
shouted the lord, irritated.

619
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,340
"Who are you, maid?"

620
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,240
"My name's Linda Chapman and I come from Greenwood."

621
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,960
The jester said, "Greenwood?

622
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,560
A wood is green, but would a wood be Greenwood?"

623
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,100
"Be quiet, Jester," said Lord Blackheart.

624
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,220
"The maid is confused.

625
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,330
Perhaps she is from another region.

626
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,420
Why are you here, my pretty?"

627
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,800
He put a hand on her shoulder.

628
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,570
Linda didn't like how he looked at her.

629
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,820
"I wanted to visit the castle with Matt, but
I don't understand what is happening," she

630
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,530
replied.

631
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,450
The jester laughed.

632
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,720
"Visit our castle?

633
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,810
Strange!"

634
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,980
He looked at Lord Blackheart.

635
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,770
"Perhaps my Lord is happy you visited our
castle."

636
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,310
Lord Blackheart continued to look at Linda.

637
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,240
He smiled and touched her hair.

638
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,010
"Now you are here, you must stay," he whispered.

639
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,100
Linda moved quickly and bit Lord Blackheart's
hand.

640
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,210
"Don't touch me!"

641
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,210
she shouted.

642
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,210
"Ouch!"

643
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,300
cried the lord, and the jester laughed.

644
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,030
"You stupid girl!"

645
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,030
Blackheart shouted.

646
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,030
"Guards!

647
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,390
Take this witch away!"

648
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,350
"Which witch, my Lord?

649
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,970
I see no witch," the jester said quietly.

650
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,619
Lord Blackheart pointed angrily at Linda,
who was furious now.

651
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,950
"This witch!

652
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:33,100
Throw her in the dungeons!"

653
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:40,300
CHAPTER TEN
In the Forest

654
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,770
The forest near the castle was quiet.

655
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,090
Under the huge moon nothing moved.

656
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,060
The forest animals slept.

657
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,130
Suddenly there was a noise; something running.

658
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,119
A fox?

659
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,500
The animals woke up.

660
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,330
The noise was loud.

661
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,090
A hungry wolf?

662
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,880
The animals were agitated.

663
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,780
They wanted to hide.

664
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,860
Too late.

665
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,860
A figure came out into the moonlight.

666
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,700
It was a boy.

667
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,230
He stopped running, exhausted.

668
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,220
The animals were happy.

669
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,480
There was no danger.

670
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,110
But there was a terrible smell!

671
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:28,140
The boy also noticed the smell.

672
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
"Yuk!

673
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,030
Now I remember.

674
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,370
The castle toilets were over the moat!"

675
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,820
It was Matt.

676
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,760
He wasn't dead, but he was very dirty and
very smelly.

677
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,380
The smell confirmed it wasn't a dream.

678
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,530
He and Linda were in the Middle Ages!

679
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,110
"Linda," Matt thought, worried.

680
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,820
"I hope she's OK.

681
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,670
But I can't do anything now.

682
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,550
Tomorrow I'll go to the castle and try to
explain.

683
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,170
Explain what?

684
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,690
That we come from the future?...

685
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,820
The computer!"

686
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,530
Matt remembered the strange white light from
the computer.

687
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,460
"Mr Wells' computer!

688
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,500
That's why he was so nervous.

689
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,840
This was his idea."

690
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,119
Matt was very angry with Mr Wells, but now
the computer was more important.

691
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,670
"We need it if we want to return to the future.

692
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,640
It must be in the castle.

693
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,060
I have to help Linda and then find the computer."

694
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,270
Matt stood up with determination, but he felt
tired.

695
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:46,330
"I'll sleep until morning, then I'll go to
the castle."

696
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:52,720
He looked around for a place to sleep but
suddenly he had a strange sensation - he felt

697
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,460
someone watching him.

698
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,380
"Who's there?" he asked nervously.

699
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,380
No one answered.

700
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,510
"I know someone is there," he said, angry
now.

701
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,340
A small deer appeared through the trees.

702
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,359
It looked curiously at Matt.

703
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,580
"It was you," Matt whispered, smiling.

704
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,370
Then something flew by his ear.

705
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,780
An arrow hit a tree near the deer and the
animal ran away.

706
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,230
Matt turned and in the darkness saw the figure
of a boy.

707
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:29,730
"Hey you!" he shouted, but the figure started
to run.

708
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,500
Matt ran faster and he caught the boy.

709
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,630
The boy was terrified and stammered, "Don't
kill me...

710
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,570
I'm sorry... we're starving!"

711
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,660
"I don't want to kill you," said Matt.

712
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,140
"Are you from the castle?" asked the boy.

713
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,970
He was a little older than Matt.

714
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,990
"No."

715
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,560
Matt thought for a moment.

716
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,560
"I'm a pilgrim from the north."

717
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,730
The boy smiled.

718
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,240
He didn't have many teeth.

719
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,430
"In the village we are very poor.

720
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,700
Life was better before.

721
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,470
Lord Ducksbury was good and strong, but he
went on the Crusades.

722
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:15,290
His brother became the lord but a bad knight,
Blackheart, killed him.

723
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,990
Now Blackheart is our lord.

724
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,370
We work all day on the land but he takes our
crops.

725
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,100
We have little to eat.

726
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,410
My father is dead.

727
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:33,320
He was killed by Blackheart's men because
he hunted in the lord's forest.

728
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,200
He wanted food for my brothers and sisters.

729
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,500
I'm the oldest, so now I hunt at night."

730
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,820
He was very thin and had simple, dirty clothes.

731
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,580
Matt was sorry for him.

732
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,880
But then he looked at his clothes.

733
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,340
They were covered in mud, or worse.

734
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,500
"Pilgrim," smiled the boy, "you can come to
my home for the night.

735
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,320
Are you hungry?

736
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,870
I'm sorry I didn't catch the deer."

737
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:07,230
"Thanks, you're very kind," said Matt.

738
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:15,610
"And Pilgrim," continued the boy, "tomorrow
you can have a bath in the pond.

739
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,740
You smell!"

740
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:26,550
CHAPTER ELEVEN
A Medieval Village

741
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:31,480
"What's your name?"

742
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,420
Matt asked the boy.

743
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
He laughed.

744
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,769
"Watt is my name, Pilgrim."

745
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:38,170
They were out of the forest.

746
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,210
"This is where we work."

747
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,830
There was a big open field, divided into strips.

748
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,340
Every strip was for a different crop.

749
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,710
"Do you have any animals?"

750
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,710
Matt asked.

751
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,720
"Yes, some sheep, pigs and a cow.

752
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,070
At night they stay in our cottage."

753
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,170
Matt was surprised.

754
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,860
"But they don't smell like you, Pilgrim!"

755
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,970
They crossed the field and came to the village.

756
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,500
There was one street of dry mud with a dozen
cottages.

757
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,020
The cottages were made of wood and had a thatched
roof.

758
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,180
"This is my cottage," whispered Watt.

759
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
"Sshh.

760
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,030
The children are sleeping."

761
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,570
"Watt," a girl whispered from the darkness.

762
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,350
The voice came from the cottage opposite.

763
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,710
"Anne, why aren't you in bed?" asked Watt.

764
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:27,760
"I was worried.

765
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,700
Did you catch anything?" asked the girl.

766
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,110
"Only a smelly pilgrim!"

767
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,860
The girl laughed and said goodnight.

768
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,630
"That's Anne," said Watt.

769
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,580
"She will be my wife.

770
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,130
Are you married?"

771
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,950
"No," smiled Matt.

772
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,930
He remembered that medieval people married
very young.

773
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:54,340
He felt admiration for this boy with the responsibilities
of a man.

774
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:01,150
On the cottage, it was very dark, but Matt
saw there was one long room, divided into

775
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,260
two parts.

776
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,780
From the other part came the noise and smell
of the animals.

777
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,270
The air was humid and smoke from the fire
irritated his eyes.

778
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,400
"Here's some pottage," said Watt.

779
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,230
He offered Matt a wooden bowl of soup.

780
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:25,120
"No spoon, I have to drink it," Matt thought,
and drank the tepid mix of vegetables and

781
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,000
cereal.

782
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,300
He felt better, but he didn't like taking
the family's food.

783
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,670
"I'm fine," he said when Watt offered more.

784
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,090
"Then drink some ale.

785
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,040
My mother makes it."

786
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,570
Matt drank some beer from a flask.

787
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:48,040
"Now to bed," said Watt and got into bed,
still dressed.

788
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,560
Matt couldn't see much, but moved towards
the bed.

789
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,020
He started to take off his dirty clothes,
but Watt whispered, "Tomorrow you can wash.

790
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,040
Now sleep."

791
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,510
Matt got into the bed but his legs were too
long.

792
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,470
He remembered that Medieval people were quite
short.

793
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:15,220
He also saw that Watt wasn't horizontal in
the bed but sat, his back on the pillows.

794
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:22,830
"Oh yes," he thought, remembering Mr Wells'
lessons, "they were frightened of death."

795
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,620
The bed wasn't very comfortable.

796
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:32,390
The mattress was full of straw and the blanket
was rough wool.

797
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,560
Something ran over Matt's foot.

798
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,970
"What was that?"

799
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,300
"Probably a rat," Watt replied.

800
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,000
Matt quickly pulled up his legs.

801
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,570
"Good night," said Watt.

802
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,970
Matt was very tired and slept immediately.

803
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:59,190
Strange dreams filled the night - angry guards,
Mr Wells, rats, computers and Linda.

804
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:04,710
Then suddenly there was a loud man's voice,
people shouting, "A witch!

805
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,400
A witch!"

806
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,300
"Wake up, Pilgrim," someone said, pulling
Matt's arm.

807
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,980
He slowly opened his eyes.

808
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,119
It was morning and there was great commotion.

809
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,450
Matt was astonished to see a lot of children
in the bed.

810
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,320
He counted eight.

811
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,720
They all repeated the same words, "A witch!"

812
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,619
"What's happening?"

813
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:34,710
Matt asked Watt.

814
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,730
"A knight came to the village.

815
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,130
He said there's a witch in the castle."

816
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,130
"Linda!"

817
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,130
Matt thought.

818
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,720
"What will happen to her?" he asked.

819
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,930
"An ordeal!

820
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,619
This morning, in the pond!

821
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:53,380
Few people survive!"

822
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:03,000
CHAPTER TWELVE
At the Pond

823
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,790
Linda opened her eyes slowly.

824
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,020
It was morning and there was a pale light
in the room.

825
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,690
"It's time for school," she thought.

826
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:19,110
Then she saw the slimy stone walls and the
tiny window and she remembered.

827
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:25,630
She wasn't at home in Greenwood - she was
in the dungeons of Ducksbury Castle, on a

828
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,370
straw mattress on the floor.

829
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,330
She felt very cold and lonely.

830
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,410
Somebody knocked at the door.

831
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,960
Linda stood up and pulled some straw out of
her hair.

832
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,970
The door opened.

833
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,970
It was the jester.

834
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,010
He gave her some bread and a bowl of milk.

835
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,150
Linda thanked him and ate hungrily.

836
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:53,510
"Do you understand why you are here?" he asked.

837
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:58,130
He was friendly but serious and he spoke anxiously.

838
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,350
"Lord Blackheart thinks I'm a witch, but it's
not true!"

839
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,350
she replied.

840
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:08,150
"I believe you," he said, "but my Lord is
angry and you are in danger.

841
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,560
Today he will take you to the village pond
for a public ducking."

842
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,369
"A ducking?"

843
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,640
Linda was shocked.

844
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,790
She remembered ducking from her history lessons
- they put people under water for a long time

845
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,440
to test their innocence.

846
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,500
They often died.

847
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,609
"But he can't do that to me!

848
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,570
I didn't do anything wrong!"

849
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,500
she cried desperately.

850
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,840
The jester looked at Linda sadly.

851
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,360
"I'm sorry, my poor strange maid.

852
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,220
I can't help you now.

853
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,099
Good luck."

854
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:44,320
A guard appeared.

855
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,190
"Are you ready, witch?

856
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,140
The cart is outside," he said.

857
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,530
He pushed her up the stairs and into the bailey.

858
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:59,570
Linda saw the cart and horse, ready to take
her to the village pond.

859
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,390
Blackheart was beside the cart.

860
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,060
Linda saw his dark, cruel face.

861
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,440
He smiled horribly.

862
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,520
Now she wasn't frightened, but very angry.

863
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,020
The cart moved slowly towards the village.

864
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,020
Some peasants walked beside it.

865
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,990
One shouted to the cart-driver, "Is this the
witch?

866
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,250
She's very young!"

867
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:32,250
"So perhaps she will survive!"

868
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:36,050
laughed the cart-driver nastily.

869
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,880
Linda shivered, but was determined to be brave.

870
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,670
She began to make a plan.

871
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,730
"I'm a good swimmer.

872
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,740
I can try to escape under the water," she
thought.

873
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:53,570
Now the cart was in the village street, and
Linda saw the poor cottages and the dirty

874
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,480
little children with no shoes.

875
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,340
"I must appear very strange, in my tracksuit
and trainers," she thought.

876
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,950
After the cottages, Linda saw the pond.

877
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:10,250
It was very large, full of reeds and surrounded
by grass and trees.

878
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,930
Some ducks swam happily on the water.

879
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,190
Lord Blackheart was near the water with the
guards.

880
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,370
They had a long rope and a large sack full
of stones.

881
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,600
"Good day, my pretty.

882
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:35,830
But it is a sad day when a fair maid dies
as a witch," he said, laughing cruelly.

883
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,960
There were many villagers there, looking curiously
at Linda.

884
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,859
They talked noisily and pointed at her.

885
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:47,520
Linda looked hopefully for Matt, but he wasn't
there.

886
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,349
The only kind face was the jester's.

887
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:55,320
He looked quickly at Linda and smiled.

888
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,740
Then he started to amuse the villagers and
they laughed at his jokes.

889
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:06,060
"His name is Blackheart, his heart is black,
he kills his witches with a rope and sack!"

890
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,880
A guard pushed Linda from the cart and tied
the rope around her.

891
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,780
"I must stay calm," she thought.

892
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,390
"Don't forget the sack," ordered Blackheart.

893
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:23,320
"The witch must stay under the water until
I decide."

894
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:35,869
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Ducking

895
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:41,020
Blackheart gave the signal and a guard pushed
Linda into the pond.

896
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,480
The water was cold... and deep!

897
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,020
Linda desperately tried to swim but the sack
of stones pulled her under.

898
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,220
"Stay calm!"

899
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,740
she thought, remembering her swimming lessons.

900
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,540
"I've got enough air for a minute or two.

901
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,110
I must take off the rope!"

902
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:03,230
Linda pulled hard but the rope was tied very
well...

903
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:08,099
Above the water, Lord Blackheart watched.

904
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:10,820
Bubbles came to the surface.

905
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,010
The guards looked at him but he didn't give
any orders.

906
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,650
Minutes passed.

907
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,420
The villagers talked nervously.

908
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,730
"Why does Blackheart wait?

909
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,620
The girl will not survive!"

910
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,790
they said.

911
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:27,310
The jester spoke, sadly and angrily.

912
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:33,090
"You are all responsible for this crime, a
young maid's death is a tragic rhyme."

913
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,810
Blackheart waited, then finally he was satisfied.

914
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,820
"Pull her up!" he shouted.

915
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:49,010
The guards pulled the rope and the sack of
stones appeared, but... where was Linda?

916
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,990
The crowd, incredulous, moved towards the
water.

917
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,210
Blackheart pushed through the people, furious.

918
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,720
"Where is the witch?

919
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,150
Find her!"

920
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,340
He pushed a guard into the pond.

921
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,340
"My lord!

922
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,510
I can't swim!" said the guard.

923
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,820
"Don't stop, you imbecile!

924
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,500
You must find her!"

925
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,080
Blackheart was hysterical with anger.

926
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:19,040
On the other side of the pond, in the shadow
of the trees, two figures emerged silently

927
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,960
from the water: Matt and Linda!

928
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,010
Nobody saw them running through the forest,
in the direction of the castle.

929
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,720
"Matt, stop for a second!

930
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,560
I'm exhausted," implored Linda.

931
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,700
"OK, Linda, but we don't have much time."

932
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,800
Linda sat on the grass.

933
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,660
"How did you know I was under the water, Matt?"

934
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,660
"A guard announced the ducking in the village
this morning.

935
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:49,220
My new friend, Watt, showed me the place and
gave me a knife.

936
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,900
Then I hid in the long grass beside the pond.

937
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,150
When you were underwater, I swam to you and
cut the rope.

938
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:02,740
I know you're a good swimmer, so it was easy
to swim to the other side of the pond."

939
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:09,109
"You saved my life, Matt," said Linda, looking
at him in admiration.

940
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:11,089
Matt's face became pink.

941
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:17,340
"No problem," he said, embarrassed, "but now
we must find the computer.

942
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,619
We need it to go back to the future!"

943
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,550
"I know where it is," smiled Linda.

944
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,920
"I hid it when we arrived."

945
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,920
"Great!

946
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,980
Let's go!" said Matt happily.

947
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,150
"OK," said Linda.

948
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,880
"I'm tired of being a witch!"

949
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,609
"And I'm tired of being wet and smelly!"

950
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:35,930
laughed Matt.

951
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:41,050
At the pond, Blackheart's face was red with
anger.

952
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:45,940
"Who is responsible for this?" he yelled,
looking at the villagers.

953
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,349
"Perhaps she was a real witch," said a voice
from the crowd, "so she disappeared!"

954
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,269
"Silence, ignorant fools!"

955
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:54,970
shouted Blackheart.

956
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,920
He pointed his sword at the villagers.

957
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
"Enough!"

958
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
cried Watt.

959
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,850
"You are the fool!"

960
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:06,390
He picked up some mud and threw it at the
lord.

961
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,080
It hit him directly in the face.

962
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,370
First, there was silence.

963
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,750
The villagers were shocked.

964
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:22,210
Then everybody began to laugh.

965
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,940
Blackheart slowly removed the mud.

966
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,690
His face was a mask of fury.

967
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:32,760
"I give you work, a home and my protection.

968
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,250
You insult me!

969
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,440
I can find other people to work on my land.

970
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,630
Guards!

971
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:48,210
Kill them all!"

972
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,470
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
A Welcome Return

973
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,619
"Stop!"

974
00:56:54,619 --> 00:57:00,560
ordered a strong, brave voice.

975
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,190
Blackheart's knights immediately stopped their
attack.

976
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,910
The voice came from the village.

977
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,540
Everybody looked in that direction.

978
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,920
A group of men appeared.

979
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,710
One man was on a horse.

980
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:18,570
He had a chain mail coat, an iron helmet and
iron leggings.

981
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,790
Under the helmet was a good, strong face.

982
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,030
"Stop, I say!"

983
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,020
the man shouted again.

984
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,670
Watt remembered that face.

985
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:34,570
When he was a small boy that face signified
justice.

986
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:41,420
That was before Blackheart, before his father's
death, before poverty.

987
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,850
"It's Lord Ducksbury!"

988
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,609
Watt shouted with joy.

989
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,609
The other villagers started to shout too.

990
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,859
"Long live Ducksbury!

991
00:57:50,859 --> 00:57:53,109
Death to Blackheart!"

992
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:55,210
Blackheart's knights were frightened now.

993
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,350
They looked for their lord, but he wasn't
there.

994
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:04,599
The villagers surrounded them, shouting, "Death
to Blackheart and his men!"

995
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:05,859
"Stop, everybody!"

996
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,770
Lord Ducksbury was now at the pond.

997
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,520
"Where is Blackheart?"

998
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,859
he asked angrily.

999
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,490
"Where is my brother's assassin?"

1000
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,450
Watt saw a familiar figure running towards
the forest.

1001
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,300
"My Lord, I can stop him.

1002
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,550
Give me a bow and arrow," he said.

1003
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,599
"Don't kill him," said Ducksbury.

1004
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:26,599
"I want him alive.

1005
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:29,370
Give the boy a bow," he ordered his men.

1006
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,400
"I remember his father was a good archer."

1007
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,369
Watt took the bow and arrow.

1008
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:37,850
Blackheart was nearly in the forest.

1009
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:43,119
"I didn't hit the deer last night," Watt thought,
"but this is for my father."

1010
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,220
The distance was huge but the arrow flew perfectly.

1011
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,820
It hit Blackheart in the leg and the cruel
lord fell into the pond.

1012
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,400
"Pull him out!"

1013
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,119
Ducksbury ordered his men.

1014
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,050
"Then pull out the arrow and throw him in
the dungeons.

1015
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,670
He will pay for his crimes."

1016
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,280
He turned to Watt.

1017
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,040
"Thank you, boy.

1018
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,200
But what terrible torture was this?"

1019
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:15,340
"An ordeal for a witch, my Lord," replied
Watt, "but she wasn't a witch.

1020
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,720
She's the companion of a pilgrim from the
north."

1021
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,270
"And where is she now, boy?"

1022
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,359
"She escaped," Watt smiled.

1023
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,700
The lord smiled at Watt.

1024
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,690
His face showed the signs of a thousand adventures.

1025
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:35,170
Now he spoke to the villagers and Blackheart's
knights.

1026
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:37,440
He was very angry.

1027
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,599
Ordeals, witches, what barbarity is this?

1028
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:53,220
I went on a Crusade to liberate the Holy Land
from barbarity - but we are the barbarians.

1029
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:58,110
I saw Christians kill other people in the
name of God.

1030
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:02,240
Then I return to England and what do I find?

1031
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:09,190
My brother killed and Blackheart the lord
of a cruel manor, where innocent girls risk

1032
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,810
death.

1033
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,180
Here is a paradox for my jester."

1034
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,170
He looked for the jester but he couldn't see
him.

1035
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,760
Watt spoke for the villagers.

1036
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,770
"Life will be better now.

1037
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:24,700
Long live Lord Ducksbury!"

1038
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:31,130
And everybody shouted happily.

1039
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,810
Matt and Linda were in the castle.

1040
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,830
It was deserted.

1041
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,450
Everybody was at the pond.

1042
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,180
"Quickly," said Linda, "before they come back.

1043
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,320
The computer's in this stable."

1044
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,410
She ran into a stable and started to move
a pile of straw.

1045
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:57,660
"Matt," she said desperately, "it isn't here!"

1046
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:05,270
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Back in Time

1047
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:10,830
It isn't there because it's here," said a
voice Linda recognised.

1048
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:15,040
The jester was outside the stable and he had
the computer.

1049
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,920
"Who's this?" asked Matt.

1050
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,350
"A friend," replied Linda.

1051
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,450
The jester smiled.

1052
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:26,630
"All the world knows I am only a fool, but
only a fool knows all the world.

1053
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,270
I observe and understand many things."

1054
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,490
"What do you mean?" said Linda.

1055
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:34,580
"I know you are strangers in this place.

1056
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:39,960
Your secret must be in this special box,"
the jester replied, "but the stable was not

1057
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,430
a good place for it."

1058
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,119
"It's very important for us," said Matt, anxiously.

1059
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,200
"Will you give it to us?"

1060
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,470
"Of course!"

1061
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,970
laughed the jester."

1062
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:53,950
What favour can a friend do, if not give all
his help to you?

1063
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:59,660
This is yours."

1064
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,480
Linda shyly kissed the jester on the cheek.

1065
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,970
He became red.

1066
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:08,349
"For once I have no words!" he said.

1067
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,760
"But now it's time for you to go."

1068
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,260
Linda opened the computer and they heard a
familiar beep.

1069
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,599
But the screen was empty.

1070
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,430
"What do we do now?" said Matt.

1071
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,430
"Quickly!"

1072
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,430
insisted the jester.

1073
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:23,430
"I hear people!

1074
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,089
You must escape now!"

1075
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:26,620
Linda thought for a moment.

1076
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,850
"Of course!

1077
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:29,700
Thank you, Jester!

1078
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,550
Press ESCAPE, Matt!"

1079
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:36,869
Matt pressed the button and they disappeared
in a flash of white light.

1080
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,119
The jester smiled.

1081
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:40,450
"This magic was a joy to see.

1082
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,880
Goodbye, my friends.

1083
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,400
Remember me."

1084
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,940
Linda opened her eyes.

1085
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:52,089
Matt was beside her on the grass, slowly waking
up.

1086
01:02:52,089 --> 01:02:57,810
She looked around and was happy and relieved
to see the castle ruins.

1087
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,930
They were behind the drinks kiosk.

1088
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:00,930
"Matt!

1089
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,440
We're in the future again!"

1090
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,430
"I can see," said Matt, "but is it the present?"

1091
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,310
A familiar voice answered his question.

1092
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,310
"Matt!

1093
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,310
Linda!

1094
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:13,570
Where are you?

1095
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,010
The bus is going!"

1096
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:17,150
It was Stubbs.

1097
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,160
"Here we are!"

1098
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,170
The two friends appeared from behind the kiosk.

1099
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,350
Stubbs looked at them, incredulous.

1100
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:26,210
"Where were you?

1101
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,950
And why are you so dirty?"

1102
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:32,450
Matt and Linda looked at each other.

1103
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,980
Their clothes were still a little wet and
muddy.

1104
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,210
They laughed.

1105
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:38,280
"Matt!

1106
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,490
You smell terrible!"

1107
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,630
continued Stubbs.

1108
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:46,720
"Did you fall into a medieval moat?"

1109
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,700
"No, I jumped in," replied Matt impulsively.

1110
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:56,420
Stubbs was surprised and curious, but Linda
said quickly, "Matt's joking!

1111
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:59,530
He doesn't want to say that we went to Ducksbury
pond.

1112
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:01,710
He fell in and I saved him!"

1113
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,520
They all laughed.

1114
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,240
As they went towards the bus Matt whispered
to Linda, "Thanks, that was a great idea."

1115
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,230
"Hurry up, you two," said Stubbs.

1116
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:17,100
"I'll show you my guidebook on the bus.

1117
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,420
Did you know there was once a cruel lord called
Blackheart at the castle?

1118
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,560
He killed witches in the pond."

1119
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,880
"What happened to him?" asked Linda curiously.

1120
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,480
"He escaped from prison into the forest but
was killed by wolves."

1121
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,670
Stubbs arrived at the bus first.

1122
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,300
"Look, everybody!

1123
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,450
Matt and Linda fell in the pond!"

1124
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:44,780
The class laughed, but Linda and Matt weren't
embarrassed.

1125
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,930
They laughed too.

1126
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,820
Then Mr Wells appeared.

1127
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,010
"Here you are!" he said with relief.

1128
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:56,300
"I hope you enjoyed your trip."

1129
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:02,240
Matt and Linda looked at each other, smiled
and gave him his computer.

1130
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:26,460
"It was a little boring," they said together.

1131
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,230
- THE END -
