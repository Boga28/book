CHAPTER ONE
Health Problems

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:14,880
There were four of us - George, William Samuel
Harris, myself (my friends call me J), and

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,380
Montmorency.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:24,300
We were sitting in my room and were smoking
and talking about our bad health.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,900
We were all feeling very ill, and we were
unhappy about it.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,680
Harris said he felt dizzy sometimes.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,690
George felt dizzy, too.

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,450
My big problem was my liver.

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,480
I knew I had a bad liver.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,060
I had read about all the symptoms of liver
disease in a book.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,660
I had every symptom that was written.

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,330
Every time I read about an illness, I realise
that I have it.

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,530
One day, I had a little health problem.

14
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,649
I went to the British Museum Library to read
about it.

15
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:12,109
After some time, I began reading about another
illness.

16
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:17,510
I don't remember the name now, but it was
something terrible.

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,420
I knew I had that terrible illness, too.

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,870
I began reading the book from the letter 'a'
to the letter 'z' I had the symptoms of all

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,090
the diseases in the book, except for one!

20
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,840
I didn't have housemaid's knee.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
This made me a bit unhappy.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,219
Why didn't I have housemaid's knee, too?

23
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,819
With all the diseases I had, I knew my life
was short.

24
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,490
I tried to examine myself.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,060
I tried to feel my heart.

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,439
I tried to look at my tongue.

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,979
When I had walked into the library, I had
been a happy, healthy man.

28
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:11,870
When I left it, I was a very ill man.

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,870
I went to see my doctor.

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,150
He is an old friend.

31
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:25,390
Whenever I think I am ill, he examines me
and says I am fine.

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,980
A doctor really must have practice!

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:37,270
This time, I thought, he will get more practice
with me than with a thousand normal patients.

34
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,450
After all, normal patients have only one or
two diseases each.

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,480
'Well, what's wrong with you?' he asked.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,510
I said, 'If I tell you what is wrong with
me, you will die before I finish.

37
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,010
Life is too short!

38
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,060
I'll tell you what is not wrong with me...

39
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,070
I don't have housemaid's knee.

40
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,220
But I have everything else.'

41
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,570
I told him about what I had read at the library.

42
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,310
He looked at me carefully.

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,480
He listened to my heart and looked at my tongue.

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,310
After that, he wrote a prescription I and
gave it to me.

45
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,920
I put it in my pocket and went out.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,320
I didn't read the prescription.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,210
I took it to the chemist's and gave it to
him.

48
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,330
He read it and gave it back to me.

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,650
He said, 'I don't have the things on the prescription.'

50
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,800
'But you're a chemist, aren't you?'

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,390
I asked.

52
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,400
He said, 'You're right, sir.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,790
I'm a chemist.

54
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,980
I don't have a shop and a hotel.'

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,560
I read the prescription.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,370
It said:

57
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,300
Every six hours: lb of good, fresh meat, pint
of beer

58
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,560
Every morning: ten-mile walk

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,680
Go to bed no later than II o'clock each night
and don't read books about things you don't

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,290
understand.

61
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,970
I followed the doctor's prescription.

62
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,209
It saved my life.

63
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,759
I now feel rather well, except for my liver
problem.

64
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:36,330
The main symptom of liver disease is 'a general
feeling of sleepiness and no interest in working.'

65
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,379
I have suffered from this illness ever since
I was a boy.

66
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,120
Medical science was not advanced in those
days.

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,569
Doctors did not know that I had liver illness.

68
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,400
They thought I was lazy.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,290
People called me 'a lazy little devil', and
said, 'go and do your work.'

70
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,889
They did not know I was ill with liver disease.

71
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:08,009
Instead of giving me liver pills, they gave
me blows on the head.

72
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,139
Those blows were good for me, because after
each blow I went to do my work.

73
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,249
That old remedy worked better than a box of
modern pills.

74
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:26,320
That evening, George, William Harris and I
sat in my room.

75
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
We described our illnesses.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,939
I explained to George and William Harris how
I felt in the morning.

77
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,380
William Harris told us how he felt when he
went to bed.

78
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,310
Then George stood up, and told us how he felt
at night.

79
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,719
George always thinks he is ill, but there
is really nothing wrong with him.

80
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:57,830
At that moment, Mrs Poppets, the housekeeper,
I served our dinner.

81
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,419
We were not hungry.

82
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,469
We ate some meat, onions and cake.

83
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,430
We had no interest in food.

84
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,760
We began talking about our illnesses again.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,340
We all knew that our illnesses were caused
by too much work.

86
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,490
'We need a rest,' said Harris.

87
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,639
'A rest and a change,' George added.

88
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,849
'Our minds are tired from too much work.

89
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,889
We must rest our minds.'

90
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,020
'Let's go to the countryside!'

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
I said.

92
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,419
'We'll find a nice, quiet place, with no people.'

93
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,849
Harris said, 'Oh, how boring!

94
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,529
In the country everyone goes to bed at eight
o'clock.

95
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,319
You can't even find a newspaper!

96
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,919
If you want a rest and a change, then the
best place is the sea.'

97
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,589
'What a terrible idea!'

98
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:52,589
I said.

99
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,289
'A sea trip gives you seasickness.

100
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,749
Who wants a whole week of seasickness?

101
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:02,900
You leave on Monday and you're feeling well.

102
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,719
On Tuesday you feel worse.

103
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,139
Then on Wednesday you're really sick.

104
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,569
On Thursday and Friday you're almost dead.

105
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,639
On Saturday you can finally drink a few teaspoons
of tea.

106
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,099
On Sunday you can walk again and eat some
food.

107
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,819
Then on Monday you're happy, because it's
time to get off the boat.'

108
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,860
So George said, 'Let's go up the river.

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,120
We'll have fresh air and quiet on the river.

110
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,490
The hard work on the boat will make us hungry,
so we'll enjoy our food.

111
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,030
We'll be so tired at the end of the day, that
we'll sleep well.'

112
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,270
Harris said, 'You don't have any trouble sleeping,
George.

113
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,830
There are only twenty-four hours in the day,
and you sleep most of that time.

114
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,099
If you sleep any more, you're dead!

115
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,699
However, I like your idea of a holiday on
the River Thames.'

116
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,449
I liked it too.

117
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,439
George was surprised that we both liked his
idea.

118
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,610
The only one who didn't like the idea was
Montmorency, my fox-terrier.

119
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,490
He looked at us with his big eyes.

120
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,020
'You like the idea, but I don't,' his face
said.

121
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,779
'On the river there's nothing for me to do.

122
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,740
I don't like looking at the trees.

123
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,550
I certainly don't smoke.

124
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,899
If I see a rat, you won't stop the boat so
I can run after it.

125
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,149
When I'm asleep, you'll probably rock the
boat, and I'll fall into the river.

126
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,260
The whole idea is stupid.'

127
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,190
We were three to one.

128
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,740
So we decided to go on the river trip.

129
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,660
CHAPTER TWO
Planning the Trip

130
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,310
We looked at the maps and we discussed plans.

131
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,519
We decided to start from Kingston the following
Saturday.

132
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,100
'Harris, you and I will go to get the boat
at Kingston,' I said.

133
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,430
'Then we'll take it up the river to Chertsey,
where we'll meet George.'

134
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,550
George works in the City until the afternoon.

135
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,990
(George goes to sleep at a bank from ten o'clock
to four o'clock, Monday to Friday, except

136
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,470
on Saturdays.

137
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,850
On Saturdays, they wake him up at two o'clock,
and put him outside the door.)

138
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,120
The next problem was where to sleep at night.

139
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,540
George and I didn't want to sleep at inns.

140
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,480
We wanted to camp out in the middle of nature.

141
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,100
'How beautiful,' we said, 'sleeping in the
country, under the stars, by the river!'

142
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,190
'I can imagine it all!'

143
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,310
I said.

144
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,470
There is a golden sunset.

145
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,560
The river is moving along quietly.

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
The forest is full of trees and birds.

147
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,269
The grass around us is green, and little flowers
grow here and there.

148
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,910
'Soon it is dark.

149
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,170
We row our boat into a quiet corner on the
river.

150
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,560
We put up our tent and cook a simple, healthy
meal.

151
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,390
We all sit around a warm fire and eat our
meal.

152
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,699
'We look up and see the moon and the stars.

153
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,930
Then we sit in silence.

154
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,230
How wonderful this is!

155
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,810
We go to bed, and then we dream under the
stars!

156
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,560
We dream that the world is young again.'

157
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,790
As we all sat there dreaming, Harris said,
'What happens if it rains?'

158
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,550
There is nothing poetic about Harris.

159
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,410
He is not romantic at all.

160
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,329
If Harris ever has tears in his eyes, he is
eating raw onions.

161
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:17,830
If you stand by the sea with Harris and say,
'Listen to the sounds of the sea.

162
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:25,029
Can you hear spirits singing sad songs - the
songs of those who died in these waters?'

163
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,630
he will take you by the arm and say, 'I understand,
my friend.

164
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,440
You're not feeling well.

165
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,509
Now, come with me.

166
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,889
I know a place around the corner here, where
you can get some good whisky.

167
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,940
You'll feel better soon.'

168
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,200
Harris always knows where you can find a good
whisky.

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
Harris was right about camping out when it
rains.

170
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
It's not nice at all.

171
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,589
Just imagine: it is evening.

172
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,040
You are all wet.

173
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,269
There is water in the boat and all your things
are wet.

174
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,670
You find a place on the river bank.

175
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,839
You get out of the boat and pull out the tent.

176
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,620
Now two of you try to put it up.

177
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,759
The tent is wet and very heavy.

178
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,680
It is raining hard.

179
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,810
The wind is blowing.

180
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,459
The wet tent flies about.

181
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,519
It falls on your head and makes you angry.

182
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,259
It is difficult to put up a tent in good weather.

183
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:36,899
It is impossible to do so in wet weather.

184
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,070
The other man is of no help at all.

185
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,860
He is a complete fool!

186
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,129
The wind continues to blow and the rain continues
to fall.

187
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,690
You look at the other man and say, 'What are
you doing with your side of the tent?'

188
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,410
'What are you doing?' he answers.

189
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,160
'Don't pull on your side!'

190
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,519
you shout.

191
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,569
'I didn't pull.

192
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,300
You pulled!' he shouts.

193
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,029
'You're doing everything wrong!'

194
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,029
you shout.

195
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,670
'What?' he shouts, 'I can't hear you.'

196
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,800
'You don't know how to put up a tent!

197
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,360
We'll never put up this tent,' you say.

198
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,279
At this point, the third man has pulled the
boat out of the water.

199
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,220
He is completely wet.

200
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,310
He wants to know why the tent isn't up yet.

201
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,649
Everyone is wet and angry.

202
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:34,750
Harris was right.

203
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,120
Camping out in rainy weather is not a good
idea.

204
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,770
We decided to camp out in good weather and
sleep at an inn or a hotel in bad weather.

205
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,660
Montmorency agreed with this decision.

206
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,740
He likes inns and hotels.

207
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,040
Montmorency doesn't like the quiet life.

208
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,870
He prefers noise and confusion.

209
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,000
He looks like a good, well-behaved dog.

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,870
But he's not.

211
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,630
When you look at Montmorency, you see an angel
from paradise, in the form of a small fox-terrier.

212
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,529
You think he is a sweet, gentle little dog.

213
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:24,490
When old ladies and gentlemen look at him,
tears come to their eyes.

214
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,870
When he killed twelve chickens, and I paid
for them, I changed my opinion of Montmorency.

215
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:38,269
In one year, he had one hundred and fourteen
street fights with other dogs.

216
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:44,110
An angry woman brought me her dead cat and
called me a murderer.

217
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,000
Montmorency loves to join the worst dogs.

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,370
He then takes them around town to fight other
dogs.

219
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,329
This is his idea of a happy life.

220
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,269
CHAPTER THREE
Packing

221
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:08,040
The following evening we met again to discuss
our plans.

222
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,230
Harris said, 'Now, we must decide what to
take with us.

223
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,839
You get a piece of paper, J, and you get a
pencil, George.

224
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,660
I'll write the list.'

225
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,120
Harris is always like this.

226
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,990
He tells everyone what to do, and he does
nothing.

227
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,839
My old Uncle Podger was just like Harris.

228
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,670
When Uncle Podger did a job, everybody in
the house helped.

229
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,730
One day, Uncle Podger bought a picture.

230
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,899
Aunt Podger asked, 'Where can we put this
picture?'

231
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,940
'Leave it to me.

232
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,089
Don't worry about it.

233
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,110
I'll do it all,' Uncle Podger said.

234
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,850
He sent one of the girls to buy the nails.

235
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,480
Then he sent one of the boys to tell her the
size of the nails.

236
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,560
He sent Bill to get the hammer, and he sent
Tom to get the ruler.

237
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,579
'Now get me a kitchen chair, Jim.

238
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,069
I need two people to hold the chair.

239
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,610
Maria, come here and hold the light.

240
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,649
Tom, come here and give me the nail.'

241
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,540
He finally had the nail in his hand, but it
fell on the floor.

242
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,399
Everyone looked everywhere for the nail.

243
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,389
When someone finally found it, Uncle Podger
lost the hammer.

244
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,389
'Where's the hammer?

245
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,569
Where did I put the hammer?

246
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,490
Help me find the hammer!'

247
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,550
When we found the hammer, he lost the place
on the wall to put the picture.

248
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,860
So each one of us climbed up on the chair
to look for the place.

249
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,949
Each one thought it was a different place.

250
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:50,050
When Uncle Podger climbed up on the chair,
he fell on the piano.

251
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,660
Aunt Podger was very angry.

252
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,060
She said, 'The next time you put a picture
on the wall, please tell me.

253
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,120
I'll go and spend a week with my mother!'

254
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,350
Uncle Podger tried again and again.

255
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,310
At midnight, the picture was on the wall.

256
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,970
However, it was not straight.

257
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,490
The wall was dirty.

258
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,160
Everyone was tired and unhappy.

259
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,819
Uncle Podger looked at the picture and said,
'It was such an easy job!'

260
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,130
I told Harris, 'You get the paper and pencil.

261
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,080
George will write the list, and I'll do the
work.'

262
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,210
The first list was too long.

263
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,539
We threw it away.

264
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,260
We started another list.

265
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,120
'In order to travel to the north part of the
River Thames, we need a small boat,' George

266
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
said.

267
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,230
'With a small boat, we can carry only necessary
things.

268
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,890
We won't take a heavy tent.

269
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,230
We can put a canvas cover I over the boat
at night.

270
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,120
It will be like a little house, warm and comfortable.'

271
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,180
We made a list of all the clothes we needed.

272
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,770
George said he knew everything about the right
clothes for a trip.

273
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,820
We discovered later that this wasn't true.

274
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,900
We talked about food next.

275
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,940
George said, 'Let's continue with breakfast.

276
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,150
For breakfast we'll need a frying pan.'

277
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,260
'That's quite difficult to eat,' Harris said,
smiling.

278
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,830
'Stop being stupid, Harris,' I said.

279
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,140
'Let's continue,' said George.

280
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,900
'We'll need tea, sugar, eggs, bacon, bread,
butter and jam.

281
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,059
For lunch, we can take biscuits, cold meat,
and fruit - but no cheese.

282
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,210
The smell of cheese is too strong.

283
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,280
After a day or two, everything will smell
of cheese.

284
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,350
'For dinner, we can take meat pies, fruit
pies, tomatoes and green vegetables.

285
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,750
This good food will keep us healthy,' George
said.

286
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,710
We didn't take wine or beer, because they
both make you sleep.

287
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,610
George continued, 'We'll also need a teapot,
a pan and a camping stove.

288
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,640
We don't want a paraffin oil stove.'

289
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,400
'Oh, no, not a paraffin oil stove!'

290
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,560
I said.

291
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,870
We once took a paraffin oil stove.

292
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,520
It was horrible.

293
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,150
The smell of paraffin oil was everywhere.

294
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,620
The river smelled of paraffin.

295
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,650
The wind smelled of paraffin.

296
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,529
Even the sunset smelled of paraffin.

297
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:30,559
When we visited the town of Marlow, it smelled
of paraffin, too!

298
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,220
Even the church of Marlow smelled of paraffin.

299
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,610
The countryside for miles around smelled of
paraffin.

300
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,039
We decided never to take a paraffin oil stove
again.

301
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:49,039
The next day we bought everything we needed.

302
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,169
We met in the evening to pack our suitcases.

303
00:19:52,169 --> 00:20:00,510
We got a large suitcase for the clothes, and
two large hampers for the food and utensils.

304
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,490
I am very good at packing.

305
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,360
Packing is one of those things that I do best.

306
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,830
'I'll organise the packing,' I said to George
and Harris.

307
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,990
They agreed.

308
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,140
George sat in the armchair and Harris put
his feet up on the table.

309
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,100
This was not what I had intended.

310
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,840
I wanted to organise the packing - not do
it!

311
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,520
I wanted George and Harris to do all the work.

312
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,820
However, I didn't say anything.

313
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,890
I started packing the clothes.

314
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,090
It took a long time, but I finally finished.

315
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,030
I sat on the big suitcase to close it.

316
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,990
George and Harris watched me.

317
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,860
'Aren't you putting the boots in?' asked Harris.

318
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,870
I had forgotten them!

319
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,140
'Why didn't you tell me before?'

320
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,340
I said.

321
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,930
Harris said nothing.

322
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,930
George laughed.

323
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,350
I was furious.

324
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,100
I opened the suitcase again, and packed the
boots.

325
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,039
Then an awful idea came to me.

326
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,240
Did I pack my toothbrush?

327
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,230
I started looking for it.

328
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,120
I took everything out of the suitcase.

329
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,060
I found George's toothbrush.

330
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,760
I found Harris's toothbrush.

331
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,370
But I didn't find mine.

332
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,020
In the end, I found it inside a boot.

333
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,320
I packed everything again.

334
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,570
When I finished, George asked me, 'Is the
soap in the suitcase?'

335
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,030
'I don't care about the soap,' I answered.

336
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,429
I sat on the big suitcase again to close it.

337
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:53,100
Then I remembered that my cigarettes were
in the suitcase.

338
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,690
I opened it again and finally closed it at
10:50 p.m.

339
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,130
There were still the two hampers to pack.

340
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,430
Harris and George decided to pack them.

341
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,289
I sat down to watch.

342
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,020
CHAPTER FOUR
Ready for the Trip

343
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:24,210
There were dishes, cups, bottles, pans, tomatoes,
cakes and many other things to pack in the

344
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,700
hampers.

345
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,630
As soon as George and Harris started packing,
they broke a cup.

346
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,529
And, this was just the beginning!

347
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:36,580
George is the worst packer in the world.

348
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,940
When George dies, Harris will be the worst
packer in the world.

349
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,330
They walked on things and broke them.

350
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,480
Harris put a big jar of jam on top of a tomato
and crushed I it.

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,700
George stepped on a big packet of butter,
and Harris sat on it.

352
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,740
Soon there was butter everywhere.

353
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,570
They packed the pies in the hamper.

354
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,330
Then they put heavy things on top of them.

355
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,500
The pies were crushed, just like the tomato.

356
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,540
In the middle of all of this, there was Montmorency,
of course.

357
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,700
He put his leg in the sugar, and soon there
was sugar everywhere.

358
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,649
He ran away with the teaspoons.

359
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:32,800
He pretended that the lemons were rats, and
killed three of them!

360
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,020
This was Montmorency's idea of fun.

361
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,740
At one in the morning, the packing was finished.

362
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,419
We were ready for bed.

363
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:46,769
George said, 'What time shall I wake you up?'

364
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:49,029
Harris said, 'Seven o'clock.'

365
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,530
I said, 'Six o'clock.'

366
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:58,260
'Wake us up at half past six, George,' we
said.

367
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,480
It was Mrs Poppets, who woke me up the next
morning.

368
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,330
'Do you know that it's nearly nine o'clock?'

369
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,330
'What!'

370
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,429
I shouted, as I jumped out of bed.

371
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,649
I woke up Harris and George.

372
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:16,240
We began to get ready, and we remembered that
we had packed our toothbrushes.

373
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,220
So we went to get them out of the suitcase.

374
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,460
This was not an easy job.

375
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,730
At last, we were ready to eat breakfast.

376
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,470
While we ate breakfast, George read the newspaper.

377
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:38,100
He told us about the people killed on the
river, and about the bad weather report.

378
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,880
George went to work, and Harris and I finished
our breakfast.

379
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,240
That morning, Montmorency invited two of his
friends to the house.

380
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,640
They fought most of the time.

381
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,580
When we were finally ready, we carried our
luggage to the road.

382
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,211
We waited twenty minutes for a taxi.

383
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:04,340
Taxis usually come every three minutes.

384
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,720
A crowd of people was watching us.

385
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,890
They looked at us, at Montmorency, and at
Montmorency's friends.

386
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:22,850
They looked at all our luggage: a big suitcase,
a small bag, two big hampers, some pans, some

387
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,980
umbrellas, five coats and raincoats.

388
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,970
At Waterloo Station, we took the 11:05 train
to Kingston.

389
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,970
At

390
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,110
Kingston, our boat was waiting for us below
the bridge.

391
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,760
Harris and I put our luggage in it.

392
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,510
We got on the boat happily, but Montmorency
was worried.

393
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:53,549
Harris took the oars and we started our two-week
trip on the River Thames.

394
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,110
Harris was wearing a red and orange blazer.

395
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,300
It was a beautiful, sunny day.

396
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,130
We were enjoying the first moments of our
holiday.

397
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:11,321
When we passed Hampton Court Palace, Harris
asked, 'Have you ever visited the maze here?'

398
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:16,600
He said he had gone into the maze once to
show a friend.

399
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,760
He studied a map of the maze before going
in.

400
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,090
He knew it was very easy to get out again.

401
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:29,440
Harris said to his friend, 'We'll go in and
walk around for ten minutes.

402
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
Then we'll come out and have lunch.

403
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,650
It's very easy.

404
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,630
Take the first turn to the right each time.'

405
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,039
In the maze, they met some people who had
been there for forty-five minutes.

406
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,750
They wanted to get out because they were lost.

407
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,919
Harris said, 'Follow me!

408
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,929
I'm going out in ten minutes.'

409
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:54,850
The people thanked him and started following
him.

410
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,860
Other people began following Harris, too.

411
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,160
Some of them were worried and afraid.

412
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,130
He continued turning to the right, but he
was still in the maze.

413
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,340
Harris got lost!

414
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,590
The people were angry with him.

415
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,309
They all started calling for help.

416
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,169
A young keeper 4 heard them and came to help.

417
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,720
But, he got lost, too!

418
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,260
Finally, the old keeper came back from lunch.

419
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,750
He let the people out.

420
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,450
Everyone was tired and angry.

421
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,570
Harris said, 'Let's ask George to try the
maze, on our return trip.'

422
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,309
'Not a bad idea,' I said.

423
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,029
When we passed Molesey Lock, we were the only
boat in the big lock.

424
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:52,190
Usually, the lock is a very busy place.

425
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,690
On Sundays, there are boats everywhere.

426
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,299
People like the river and the sun.

427
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:06,179
It's such a beautiful picture - the river,
the trees, the flowers and the people, in

428
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,220
their colourful clothes.

429
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,830
At Hampton, Harris wanted to stop the boat
and have a look at the church.

430
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,390
I don't like visiting churches, but Harris
loves it.

431
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,140
'I came on the trip only because I wanted
to visit Hampton Church.

432
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,490
You know, I love churches, churchyards and
tombs.

433
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,860
The idea of not seeing Hampton Church, with
Mrs Thomas's tomb, makes me angry.'

434
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,710
'Who is Mrs Thomas?'

435
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,710
I asked.

436
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,360
'I don't know, but she has a strange tomb.'

437
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,730
I said, 'We must be at Shepperton at five
o'clock to meet George.'

438
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,130
Harris said, 'George!

439
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,769
Why can't George be here to do some work?

440
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,010
Why doesn't he help us with this heavy boat?

441
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,990
What does he do at the bank?

442
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,360
He sits behind a piece of glass all day and
does nothing.

443
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,730
I work!

444
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,090
Why doesn't he work?

445
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm going to have a drink!'

446
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,990
'There are no pubs near here.

447
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,710
The nearest pub is far away,' I said.

448
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,710
'What!

449
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,410
We'll all die of thirst.

450
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,490
No pubs!'

451
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,549
'If you're thirsty, we have water in the boat.'

452
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,549
I said.

453
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,549
'Water!

454
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:22,230
Water makes people ill!' he said.

455
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,580
'However, I am very thirsty and I must drink
something.'

456
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,659
So he took the bottle and drank some water.

457
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:38,220
CHAPTER FIVE
First Day on the Boat

458
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,059
We stopped at Kempton Park and had lunch under
the trees.

459
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,580
QE Good food always calms Harris.

460
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,230
We reached Sunbury Lock at half past three.

461
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,360
We then went to Walton, which is a historical
town.

462
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,250
Julius Caesar stayed there with his soldiers.

463
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,159
Queen Elizabeth I stayed there, too.

464
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:03,350
You can never escape from that woman.

465
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,010
She was everywhere!

466
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,870
Next we came to Halliford and Shepperton.

467
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:15,240
There is a tomb in the Shepperton churchyard
with a poem on it.

468
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,039
I was afraid Harris wanted to stop and visit
it.

469
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,450
I saw him looking at the church, as we passed
near it, so I moved the boat suddenly, and

470
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,940
Harris's cap fell into the water.

471
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,240
He pulled it out and was angry with me.

472
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:40,410
Fortunately, he was worried about his wet
cap and forgot about the church.

473
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:46,029
As we came to Weybridge, the first thing we
saw was a coloured blazer.

474
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:52,030
When we got closer, we saw that George was
inside the blazer.

475
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,389
Montmorency started barking furiously.

476
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:58,549
Harris and I shouted loudly.

477
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:02,470
George waved his cap and shouted, too.

478
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:09,010
The lock-keeper I ran out, because he thought
someone had fallen into the water.

479
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:14,860
When he saw that no one was in the water,
he returned to his work.

480
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,210
Now that George was on the boat, we decided
to make him work.

481
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,390
He did not want to work, of course.

482
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,259
'I had a bad day at the bank,' George said.

483
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:32,289
Harris, who is a little cruel, said, 'Now
you're going to have a bad day on the river.

484
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,220
A change is good for you.

485
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
It's healthy!

486
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,330
Come on!

487
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,940
Get out of the boat and TOW!'

488
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,570
George didn't know what to say.

489
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,710
After a moment, he said, 'It's better if I
stay here and prepare tea.

490
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,960
It's very difficult to prepare tea, and you
look tired.'

491
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,470
We didn't answer.

492
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,140
We gave him the rope.

493
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,960
He started walking and pulling the boat.

494
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,789
I remember that George once saw a young couple
who were walking by the side of the river.

495
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,130
They were pulling a rope behind them, and
they were talking.

496
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,210
They didn't notice that there was no boat
at the end of the rope.

497
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,639
They had probably had a boat at the end of
the rope when they started.

498
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,140
But they had lost it.

499
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,750
When George saw this, he took the rope out
of the water.

500
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,279
Then he tied it to his own boat.

501
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,350
So, the young couple towed George and his
three fat friends up to Marlow.

502
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,600
When they looked back, they saw that they
were towing a boat that was not theirs.

503
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,280
The young man was surprised and angry.

504
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,960
The young lady said, 'Oh, Henry, where is
Aunt Mary?'

505
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,299
No one knew what happened to Aunt Mary.

506
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:59,909
The most exciting thing is to let girls tow
your boat.

507
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,190
You always need three girls.

508
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,059
Two of them hold the rope.

509
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:10,419
The third one runs around and laughs all the
time.

510
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,750
When they are finally ready to pull, they
start running.

511
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,710
They pull the boat too fast, and they are
soon tired.

512
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:25,870
They sit down on the grass to rest and laugh.

513
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,910
While they rest, your boat goes out into the
middle of the river.

514
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:35,299
'Oh, look,' they say, 'the boat's gone to
the middle of the river!'

515
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,210
They laugh, jump up and start pulling it again.

516
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,870
Then one of them decides to stop, because
she needs her hat.

517
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,180
Then another wants her red shawl.

518
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,029
I Now one of them needs a comb for her hair.

519
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:55,070
The other wants her handkerchief.

520
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,330
This goes on for most of the afternoon.

521
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,659
It is never boring when three girls tow a
boat.

522
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:08,869
George towed us to Penton Hook.

523
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:13,429
We stopped there and decided to spend the
night on the boat.

524
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,889
We found a pretty place.

525
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,409
We tied our boat to a big tree.

526
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,730
We were all hungry and we wanted to eat.

527
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,220
However, George said, 'No, let's put the canvas
cover on the boat first.

528
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,700
It will only take a few minutes.'

529
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,030
It looked simple, but it wasn't.

530
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,310
There were five metal rods.

531
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,419
You put them into special holes in the side
of the boat.

532
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:47,510
I didn't think this was dangerous work, but
it was.

533
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,650
I'm surprised that we are still alive to tell
the story.

534
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:57,390
First of all, the metal rods did not go into
their holes.

535
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:02,570
We jumped on them, kicked them and pushed
them.

536
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:09,619
When the rods were in their holes, we tried
to put the canvas cover on the boat.

537
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,600
George took one part of the cover.

538
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,690
He tied it at the front of the boat.

539
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:20,089
Harris stood in the middle to help George
with the cover.

540
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:26,530
George did his job well, but Harris was completely
confused.

541
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,670
After ten minutes of hard work, Harris was
inside the cover!

542
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,650
He was fighting to get out.

543
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,990
He accidentally knocked George down.

544
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,670
Now George was inside the cover, too.

545
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,430
They fought with the cover.

546
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,470
I heard some very bad words.

547
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,410
I thought the job must be very difficult.

548
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,890
I didn't understand what was happening.

549
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,590
George and Harris had told Montmorency and
me to stand at the back of the boat.

550
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,980
We did exactly that.

551
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,030
We waited quietly.

552
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:13,000
We saw the cover moving violently, but we
thought this was the correct method.

553
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,240
After a long time, we heard George shout,
'We can't breathe under here!

554
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,850
Why don't you help us, you idiot!'

555
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,040
When someone calls for help, I always answer.

556
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,020
I went to help them.

557
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:35,180
Poor Harris, his face was almost black.

558
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,050
CHAPTER SIX
Harris Makes Scrambled Eggs

559
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:46,590
As soon as the cover was in place, we started
to prepare supper.

560
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,050
We wanted some hot water to make tea.

561
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,140
We put the tea kettle on the stove.

562
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,010
We pretended that we were not interested in
the water.

563
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,250
We wanted the water to think that we did not
care about it.

564
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,180
We began to prepare supper.

565
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,220
This was the only way to make the water boil
on a boat.

566
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,920
If the water knows you are waiting for it,
it will never get hot.

567
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,319
You must not look at it.

568
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,160
It's a good idea to shout, 'I don't want any
tea.

569
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,460
Do you, George?'

570
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,440
George shouts back, 'Oh, no.

571
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,700
I don't like tea.

572
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,010
I'll have milk.'

573
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,300
'And you, Harris?'

574
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,530
'Tea is terrible.

575
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,880
I never drink it.

576
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,810
I'll have lemonade.'

577
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,390
This makes the water very angry.

578
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:49,510
At this point, the water will boil!

579
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,930
We really wanted that supper.

580
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,140
We needed that supper.

581
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,830
For thirty-five minutes nobody spoke.

582
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,120
We just ate and ate.

583
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,079
Finally, we all had full stomachs, and we
were happy.

584
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,370
A full stomach makes you feel kind and generous.

585
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,220
We sat and smiled at each other.

586
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,190
We smiled at Montmorency, too.

587
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,180
We started smoking our pipes and began to
talk.

588
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,880
We went to bed at ten o'clock.

589
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,119
I didn't sleep well.

590
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,090
I wasn't comfortable in the boat.

591
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:36,160
I woke up at six o'clock the next morning,
and George did, too.

592
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,790
There was no reason to wake up so early.

593
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,220
We were on holiday.

594
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,310
Why did we wake up so early?

595
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:49,290
It never happens to us when we're working.

596
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,790
We decided to wake up Harris.

597
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,400
This was hard work.

598
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,960
We used an oar to help us.

599
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,690
Harris moved a bit and said, 'I'll be downstairs
in a minute.

600
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,820
Get my best boots ready, please.'

601
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,430
We tried again with a boat hook.

602
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,220
Harris sat up suddenly and Montmorency fell
off the bed.

603
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:21,310
We pulled up the canvas cover and all four
of us looked out at the river.

604
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,109
We were very cold.

605
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:30,369
We had planned to go swimming, but the water
looked so cold and wet.

606
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,120
'Well, who's going swimming first?' asked
Harris.

607
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,140
No one wanted to be first.

608
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,390
George decided to get dressed.

609
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,160
Montmorency barked with horror at the idea.

610
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,560
Harris went to look for his trousers.

611
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,069
I decided to go to the river bank and throw
some water on myself.

612
00:39:55,069 --> 00:40:00,210
I held on to the branch of a tree as I moved
to the water.

613
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:06,839
It was very cold and I decided not to go in.

614
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,260
I wanted to go back to the boat.

615
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:20,809
But suddenly, the branch of the tree broke!

616
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,410
I fell into the river along with my towel.

617
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,099
I also drank about a bottle of Thames water.

618
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,359
'Good heavens!

619
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,000
Old J is in the water!'

620
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Harris said.

621
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,869
'How's the water?'

622
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:36,970
George asked.

623
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,010
'It's lovely!'

624
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,010
I answered.

625
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,109
'Why don't you come in?'

626
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,940
Nobody wanted to try the water.

627
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,819
When I got back to the boat, I was very cold.

628
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:55,190
I wanted to put on my shirt, but it fell into
the river.

629
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,230
This made me angry.

630
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,960
George started laughing.

631
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,520
'I don't see anything to laugh at,' I said.

632
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,320
George laughed even more.

633
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:17,390
I never saw a man laugh so much.

634
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,720
I was cold and furious.

635
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,250
I was trying to get my shirt out of the river.

636
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,210
George was laughing louder and louder.

637
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:35,570
'Stop laughing, you stupid idiot!'

638
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,950
I shouted.

639
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,670
When I finally pulled the shirt out of the
river, I saw that it wasn't mine - it was

640
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,940
George's shirt!

641
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,770
I started laughing too.

642
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,790
I laughed so much that I dropped the shirt
into the river again.

643
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:00,480
'Aren't you going to get it out?' said George,
who continued laughing.

644
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,609
I didn't answer him for a while, because I
was laughing so much.

645
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,540
At last I said, 'it isn't my shirt.

646
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,300
It's yours!'

647
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,140
I never saw a man's face change so quickly.

648
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,230
'What!' he shouted.

649
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,630
'You donkey!

650
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,920
I Why can't you be careful with things?

651
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,630
Why don't you go and get dressed on the river
bank?

652
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,710
People like you don't know how to live on
a boat!'

653
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:30,460
I tried to tell him how funny it was, but
he didn't understand.

654
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,910
George is a little slow at understanding a
joke sometimes.

655
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,079
Harris said, 'I'm cooking scrambled eggs for
breakfast this morning.

656
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,180
Once people try my scrambled eggs, they always
want them.'

657
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,270
He was quite famous for his scrambled eggs.

658
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,390
George and I got the stove and the frying
pan ready.

659
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,600
Then we looked for the eggs that weren't broken.

660
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,300
We found only six of them.

661
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,920
'Now you can start,' we said.

662
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,730
Breaking the eggs was difficult for Harris.

663
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,800
The eggs got on his trousers and went up his
arms.

664
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,720
He put six eggs into the frying pan.

665
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,880
Then he sat down by the stove and mixed them
with a fork.

666
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,840
George and I saw that it was difficult work.

667
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,960
Harris often burnt his fingers.

668
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,220
Then he danced around the stove.

669
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,619
He waved his hands in the air and shouted.

670
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:43,280
George and I thought that this was an important
part of his cooking method.

671
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,430
We didn't know what scrambled eggs were.

672
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:52,780
We thought they were some sort of Red Indian
food, and, to cook them correctly, it was

673
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,650
necessary to do special dances with magic
words.

674
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,960
Montmorency went to put his nose over the
frying pan once, and burnt himself.

675
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,309
He, too, began dancing around and barking.

676
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:12,140
It was interesting and exciting to watch this
show.

677
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,569
George and I were sorry when it was finished.

678
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:21,900
When the scrambled eggs were ready, there
was very little to eat.

679
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,750
Six eggs had gone into the pan.

680
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,470
But, all that came out was a teaspoon full
of burnt eggs.

681
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,619
'The problem is the frying pan,' Harris said.

682
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:37,800
'I need another type of pan and another stove.'

683
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:47,820
We decided not to try scrambled eggs again,
until Harris had the right pan and stove.

684
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,170
CHAPTER SEVEN
The Laughing Tin

685
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:59,200
When we finished breakfast, the sun was up
and it was a warm morning.

686
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,750
I sat on the river bank near Runnymede.

687
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:09,430
I thought about King John, who signed the
Magna Carta at Runnymede, in II5.

688
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,970
What a great moment in English history!

689
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,500
I imagined the scene!

690
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,640
George came over and said, 'When you finish
resting and dreaming, please help me wash

691
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,460
the dishes and other things.'

692
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:30,730
I cleaned the frying pan with some grass and
with George's wet shirt.

693
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,290
Later on, we went to Magna Carta Island.

694
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:38,030
We saw the stone where the Magna Carta was
signed.

695
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:44,210
In this area, King Henry VIII met with his
sweetheart, I Anne Boleyn.

696
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:52,260
I am certain that King Henry VIII met Anne
Boleyn in several other places, too.

697
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:59,660
We continued slowly up the river, and stopped
for lunch near Monkey Island.

698
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,340
We had cold meat for lunch.

699
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,690
'Where's the mustard?'

700
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,840
I asked.

701
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,089
'The mustard?'

702
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:08,619
Harris said.

703
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:12,599
We had forgotten to bring the mustard.

704
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,160
At that moment, we all wanted mustard more
than anything in the world.

705
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,660
'How boring life is without mustard!' said
George.

706
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,190
We ate our cold meat in silence.

707
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:34,250
We thought about the happy days of childhood
when there was lots of mustard on the table.

708
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,920
The adult world can be a cruel place.

709
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,890
All three of us loved tinned fruit.

710
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,640
George brought out a tin of pineapple.

711
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,550
This was perfect to make us forget the mustard.

712
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,589
We felt that life was smiling at us again.

713
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:59,340
'Look at the picture on the tin!' said Harris.

714
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,370
'Ah, I can't wait!'

715
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,579
I said.

716
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:09,010
'I'm dreaming about the sweet juice,' George
said.

717
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,020
Harris got a spoon ready.

718
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,930
Then we looked for the tin-opener.

719
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,300
We took everything out of the two hampers.

720
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,880
We took everything out of the bag.

721
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,650
We looked in every corner of the boat.

722
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,710
There was no tin-opener.

723
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:34,100
Harris tried to open the tin with a little
knife, and he cut himself.

724
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,020
George tried to open it with a pair of scissors.

725
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,890
The scissors flew up and almost cut his eye.

726
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,310
I tried to open it with a piece of metal.

727
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:50,980
I did something wrong, because I fell into
the river.

728
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:56,750
The tin flew away and broke a teacup.

729
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,799
Then we all got angry.

730
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:03,540
I started hitting the tin with a piece of
wood.

731
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,490
Harris hit the tin, and so did George.

732
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,470
We changed its shape.

733
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,240
We made it square.

734
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,780
We made it round.

735
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,079
Then we made it flat.

736
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,150
But, we still couldn't open it.

737
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:21,869
The tin looked at us and seemed to be laughing.

738
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:25,650
It was ugly and it frightened us.

739
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,470
I threw it in the river!

740
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:34,579
Then we rowed away and didn't stop until we
reached Maidenhead.

741
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:39,100
It was evening and a strong wind started blowing.

742
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:44,869
The wind was behind us and we put up the sail
quickly.

743
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:49,240
The wind blew and the boat flew up the river.

744
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:58,410
I was steering I the boat, and George and
Harris were enjoying the trip.

745
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,290
Sailing is exciting.

746
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:03,220
It's almost like flying.

747
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,750
You feel that you are part of nature.

748
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:11,089
We were alone and we flew along the river.

749
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:15,160
Far in the distance, we saw a small fishing
boat.

750
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,390
There were three fishermen in it.

751
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:25,589
The sun was going down, and there was a red
light on the water.

752
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,299
The river seemed magic.

753
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:30,890
It was like a dream.

754
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:36,670
We felt that we were sailing into a strange
land.

755
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,670
We did not sail into a strange land.

756
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:44,990
We sailed straight into the fishing boat with
the three old fishermen!

757
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,930
At first, we didn't know what was happening.

758
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:53,700
But, when we heard the bad words that came
from the other boat, we knew we were near

759
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,790
people.

760
00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:00,299
We also knew that those people were not happy.

761
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:04,470
The three old fishermen fell off their seats.

762
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:07,670
There were fish all over them.

763
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,230
They slowly tried to get up.

764
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,300
As they did this, they cursed us.

765
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,359
They didn't curse us with common curses.

766
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,130
They used long, special curses.

767
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:33,069
They also cursed our parents, families, friends,
neighbours, pets and jobs.

768
00:50:33,069 --> 00:50:37,750
These curses were for the present and the
future.

769
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:43,470
Harris stood up and said, 'Be thankful for
a bit of excitement in your lives!

770
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:48,900
Your lives must be so boring, just sitting
and fishing all day.

771
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,930
My friends and I are very unhappy to hear
men of your age use such bad words.'

772
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,900
The three old men did not agree with Harris.

773
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,180
'I'll steer the boat now, J,' said George.

774
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,230
'An intelligent man like you must do better
things.

775
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:12,059
Leave the steering to me, before we all drown.'

776
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:18,559
CHAPTER EIGHT
Montmorency Meets a Cat

777
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,070
At Marlow, we left our boat by the bridge.

778
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,020
We spent the night at the Crown Hotel.

779
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:29,900
The next morning we went swimming before breakfast.

780
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,809
On the way back, Montmorency met a cat.

781
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:38,210
Montmorency and I don't agree on cats.

782
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,180
I like cats.

783
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,190
Montmorency doesn't.

784
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,680
When I meet a cat, I stop and say hello.

785
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,010
I petI it gently.

786
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:54,359
The cat is happy, and I am too.

787
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:59,450
When Montmorency meets a cat, the whole street
knows about it.

788
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:04,470
A lot of bad words fly through the air.

789
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:10,270
As soon as Montmorency saw the cat, he barked
with happiness.

790
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:16,100
The cat was walking slowly across the street.

791
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,790
Montmorency ran after the cat.

792
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,049
But the cat didn't run.

793
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:26,410
He didn't understand that his life was in
danger.

794
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:30,109
This cat was big and black.

795
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:36,450
It had half a tail, half a nose and only one
ear.

796
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:41,270
It was a clever street cat.

797
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:47,770
Montmorency is a courageous dog, but the cold
eyes of that cat terrified him.

798
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:53,160
The cat stopped in the middle of the road
and looked at Montmorency.

799
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:58,190
Neither spoke, but the conversation was probably
like this:

800
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,470
Cat: Yes!

801
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,589
You want me?

802
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:02,230
Can I do anything for you?

803
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,620
Montmorency: No, no thanks.

804
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,369
Cat: If you really want something, please
tell me.

805
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:10,309
Montmorency: (walking backwards) Oh, no, not
at all.

806
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:11,990
Don't disturb yourself.

807
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,760
I'm afraid I made a mistake.

808
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,060
I thought I knew you.

809
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,359
Sorry I disturbed you.

810
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,500
Cat: Not at all.

811
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
It's a pleasure.

812
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,170
Are you sure you don't want anything now?

813
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,220
Montmorency: (still walking backwards) No,
thanks.

814
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,960
Nothing at all, thanks.

815
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,970
Very kind of you.

816
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:28,970
Good morning.

817
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,240
Cat: Good morning.

818
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,030
The cat got up and walked away.

819
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,070
Montmorency came back and followed us quietly.

820
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,920
He was silent all day long.

821
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,350
To this day, if you say the word 'Cats!' to
Montmorency, he'll stop walking.

822
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:53,430
Then he'll look up at you, as if to say: 'Please
don't!'

823
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:58,630
After this, we did our shopping, returned
to the boat and continued our trip up the

824
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:59,690
river.

825
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:05,309
At Hambledon Lock, we discovered that we had
no water.

826
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,720
We went to the lock-keeper to ask for some.

827
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,480
George spoke for us.

828
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,920
With a friendly smile he asked, 'May we have
some water, please.'

829
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,470
'Certainly,' said the old lock-keeper.

830
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,380
'Take as much as you want, and leave the rest.'

831
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,330
'Thank you very much,' said George, looking
around.

832
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,940
'Where is the water?'

833
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,760
'It's where it always is,' said the lock-keeper.

834
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,329
'It's behind you.'

835
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:33,140
George turned around and looked.

836
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,150
'I don't see it.'

837
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,150
'What!

838
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,430
Where are your eyes?'

839
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,990
the lock-keeper said.

840
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:42,800
He took George's arm and turned him around.

841
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,130
'Oh!'

842
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:45,420
George said.

843
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,930
'But we can't drink the river!'

844
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:51,250
'No, but you can drink some of it,' said the
lock-keeper.

845
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,700
'I've drunk river water for the past fifteen
years.'

846
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:01,010
'Well, sir, I don't think you look very healthy,
after drinking all that river water.

847
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,260
But thank you anyway,' George said.

848
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:09,450
We left the lock-keeper's place and we found
some water at another house.

849
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:15,319
We towed the boat past Henley and stopped
near Wargrave for lunch.

850
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:19,030
We were sitting in a green field near the
river.

851
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,069
Harris was cutting a meat pie.

852
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,080
George and I were waiting with our dishes.

853
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,200
'I need a spoon,' said Harris.

854
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,890
The hamper was behind us.

855
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,530
George and I both turned around to get a spoon.

856
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,599
In five seconds, we had the spoon.

857
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:41,830
When we turned back, Harris and the meat pie
were gone!

858
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,910
Disappeared!

859
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,680
It was a wide open field.

860
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,349
There were no trees nearby.

861
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:55,920
Harris did not fall into the river, because
the river was far from us.

862
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,890
George and I looked all around.

863
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,819
Then we looked at each other.

864
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,700
'Has he gone up to heaven?'

865
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,230
I asked.

866
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,630
'Angels don't take meat pies to heaven,' George
said.

867
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,069
'You're right!'

868
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:10,069
I agreed.

869
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:13,490
'Then there has been an earthquake,' George
said.

870
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,480
'I'm sorry he had the meat pie with him.'

871
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,099
Sadly, we looked at the place where Harris
and the meat pie were sitting.

872
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:29,099
Then, with horror, we saw Harris's head - only
his head.

873
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,430
It was in the grass!

874
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:35,880
His face was red and furious.

875
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,500
George was the first to speak.

876
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
'Say something!

877
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,750
Are you dead or alive?

878
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,630
Where is your body?'

879
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,210
'Oh, don't be an idiot!'

880
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,210
Harris shouted.

881
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,289
'I think you made this happen.

882
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:50,520
You told me to sit there.

883
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,430
It's your stupid joke!

884
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,980
Here, take the pie.'

885
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:00,319
Harris didn't know it, but he had been sitting
next to a big hole.

886
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,680
The long grass covered it.

887
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,160
He fell into the deep hole without knowing
anything.

888
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,359
At first, he thought that it was the end of
the world.

889
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:18,109
Harris still thinks that George and I planned
it all.

890
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:24,609
CHAPTER NINE
Fighting Swans

891
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:31,350
After lunch, a gentle wind pushed us up the
river past Wargrave and Shiplake.

892
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:36,540
We got out of the boat at Sonning and walked
around the village.

893
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,650
Sonning is a lovely village.

894
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,930
Everything is clean and beautiful.

895
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:46,520
Each house is covered with roses.

896
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:52,180
We decided to return to one of the Shiplake
islands to spend the night.

897
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,060
George said, 'Let's have a special supper
tonight.

898
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:57,410
Let's make an Irish stew.

899
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,660
We can put everything into one big pan.'

900
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,680
'What a wonderful idea!'

901
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,920
Harris and I said.

902
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,210
'I'll get the wood and make a fire,' George
said.

903
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,160
'You two can peel the potatoes.'

904
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,210
This was a very big job.

905
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,369
We were happy and excited.

906
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:23,619
But when we peeled our first potato, we understood
that this was not exciting - it was hard work.

907
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:28,160
The first potato we peeled looked like a pea.

908
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,260
George looked at it and said, 'No, no, no!

909
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,099
There's no potato left.

910
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:35,930
Do it like this.'

911
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:41,400
We worked hard for half an hour, but we peeled
only four potatoes.

912
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,589
We refused to continue.

913
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:47,570
'Well, just put the potatoes in without peeling
them.

914
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,059
Let's add some carrots and other vegetables.

915
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:53,589
Look in the hampers and take out all the pieces
of old food.

916
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:56,400
We'll put them in the stew.

917
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,240
You can put anything in a stew.'

918
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,630
We found half a pork pie, a tin of fish and
a few broken eggs.

919
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,490
We added these to the stew.

920
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:11,930
Montmorency watched us carefully and then
left.

921
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:17,309
After a while, he returned with a dead rat
in his mouth.

922
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:20,620
He wanted to add something to the stew, too.

923
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,140
We discussed it first.

924
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,460
Harris said, 'It's all right to add the dead
rat.

925
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,440
It will be mixed with the other things.

926
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,130
A stew needs many ingredients.'

927
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,539
George said, 'Well, I don't want to try anything
new.

928
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:36,260
Maybe next time.

929
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,880
I'm sorry, Montmorency.'

930
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,080
Harris said, 'If you never try anything new,
you'll never discover things.

931
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,910
It's men like you, George, who slow down the
progress of our world.'

932
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,720
George didn't listen to Harris.

933
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,010
The stew was a great success.

934
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:58,540
It was delicious - excellent in every way.

935
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,319
We all really enjoyed it.

936
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,400
After the Irish stew, George and I decided
to go to Henley for an evening walk.

937
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,650
Harris wanted to stay on the boat and drink
a whisky.

938
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,840
When we returned to the boat, Harris was sad
and confused.

939
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,559
'What happened to you, Harris?'

940
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,960
'Swans!' he said.

941
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,050
We had left the boat near a swan's nest.

942
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:30,160
When George and I were in Henley, Mrs Swan
came back to the nest.

943
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,540
She started to shout at Harris.

944
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,859
Harris frightened her away.

945
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:39,960
She went to get her husband, Mr Swan.

946
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,290
Harris had a terrible fight with these two
swans.

947
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:47,500
Harris finally won the fight.

948
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:57,170
However, half an hour later, Mr and Mrs Swan
returned with eighteen other swans.

949
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,549
There was a horrible fight.

950
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:04,510
The swans attacked Harris and tried to pull
him off the boat.

951
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:08,500
They wanted to drown Harris and Montmorency!

952
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,450
Harris fought with courage for four hours.

953
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:19,390
In the end, the swans slowly swam away to
die.

954
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:21,770
'How many swans were there?'

955
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,770
George asked.

956
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:26,380
'Thirty-two,' said Harris, who was sleepy.

957
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,210
'But you said eighteen before,' George said.

958
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,589
'No, I didn't.

959
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:32,160
I said twelve.

960
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,200
Do you think I can't count?'

961
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,839
We never discovered the truth about the swans.

962
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,579
We asked Harris about it the next morning.

963
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,220
He said, 'What swans?'

964
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,650
He thought that George and I were dreaming.

965
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,829
That night Harris had trouble sleeping.

966
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:55,039
He woke me up about twelve times during the
night.

967
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,220
He was looking for his clothes.

968
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,480
George woke up, too.

969
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,990
'Why do you need your trousers?

970
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,859
It's the middle of the night!'

971
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:05,099
George said.

972
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:08,730
Later, Harris was looking for his shoes.

973
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:12,619
Then he asked for his socks and his umbrella.

974
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:15,130
We woke up late the next morning.

975
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:19,720
We had a small breakfast and we were ready
to go.

976
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,960
We agreed that we would row the boat, and
not tow it.

977
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,369
Harris said, 'George, you and J can row.

978
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,539
I'll steer.'

979
01:02:28,539 --> 01:02:33,510
I didn't like this idea, and I said, 'No,
Harris.

980
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:38,000
You and George row, so that I can rest.'

981
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,880
I was doing too much work on this trip.

982
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,539
I always think that I work too much.

983
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:47,750
It's not because I don't like work.

984
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,760
I love it!

985
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,869
I find it very interesting.

986
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:55,420
I can sit and look at it for hours.

987
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,540
You can't give me too much work.

988
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,020
I like collecting it.

989
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,280
My office is full of it.

990
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,690
I'm very careful with my work, too.

991
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,369
Some of the work in my office has been there
for years.

992
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:12,500
It is in perfect condition.

993
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,690
It isn't dirty or anything.

994
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,880
That's because I take good care of it.

995
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,750
Harris said, 'On this boat, I'm the only one
who works.'

996
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:28,299
George said, 'You do nothing but eat and sleep,
Harris.

997
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:30,760
I'm the only one who works.

998
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,250
You and J are very lazy people.'

999
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:39,380
Harris laughed and said, 'George!

1000
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,380
Work!

1001
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,539
Have you ever seen George work?'

1002
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:47,589
I agreed with Harris, George never worked.

1003
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,750
'How do you know if I work, Harris?

1004
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,560
You're always sleeping, except at meal times.

1005
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,420
Have you ever seen Harris awake, except at
meal times?'

1006
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,010
George asked me.

1007
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:00,320
I agreed with George.

1008
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,690
Harris worked very little on the boat.

1009
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,840
'Oh, please!

1010
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,010
I do more work than old J,' Harris said.

1011
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,020
'Well, it's difficult to do less work than
old J,' George added.

1012
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:16,270
'Old J thinks he's a passenger and doesn't
need to work,' Harris said.

1013
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:21,880
After this discussion, I said to Harris, 'You
and George row the boat up to Reading.

1014
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,620
At Reading I'll tow it.'

1015
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:33,930
CHAPTER TEN
Three Men Out of a Boat

1016
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,750
We reached Reading at about II o'clock.

1017
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:43,130
The river here is very dirty, so we moved
on to Streatley.

1018
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,430
We stayed at Streatley for two days.

1019
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,869
We took our clothes to a laundry woman.

1020
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:54,800
We had tried to wash them in the river, as
George told us.

1021
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,390
The river was so dirty that our clothes collected
all the dirt from the water.

1022
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:06,319
The river became cleaner, but our clothes
became dirtier.

1023
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:13,079
The laundry woman was very surprised to see
such dirty clothes.

1024
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:18,819
She looked at them and said, 'This will cost
you three times the usual price.'

1025
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:22,900
We agreed and paid her.

1026
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,930
The river near Streatley and Goring is excellent
for fishing.

1027
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,849
It is full of different types of fish.

1028
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:35,190
Some people sit and fish there all day.

1029
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:38,990
However, they never catch any fish.

1030
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:44,940
The local fisherman's guide book doesn't say
anything about catching fish.

1031
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:50,289
It only says that the place is a good fishing
area.

1032
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:53,450
And it is!

1033
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:59,579
You can see many fish swim past, but you can't
catch them.

1034
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:04,799
When you go for a walk by the river, you can
see hundreds of fish.

1035
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,650
They come and stand half out of the water.

1036
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:12,500
Their mouths are open for bread.

1037
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,360
If you go swimming, they come to look at you
and disturb you.

1038
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,160
You cannot catch them, however.

1039
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,500
We passed by Wallingford and Dorchester.

1040
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,450
Both are ancient British towns.

1041
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:37,010
In the days of the Roman Empire, the Romans
camped here and built fortifications.

1042
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:42,920
We spent the night at Clifton Hampdon, which
is a pretty village.

1043
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:50,089
We finally arrived at Oxford and spent two
excellent days there.

1044
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:55,460
Oxford is a beautiful town with its old university.

1045
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,609
Oxford is also full of dogs.

1046
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:02,910
Montmorency was very happy.

1047
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:10,880
He had eleven dog fights on the first day
and fourteen on the second day.

1048
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,520
He probably thought he was in heaven.

1049
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:19,940
We left Oxford on the third day, to return
home to London.

1050
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:23,220
When we left Oxford, it was raining.

1051
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,670
The rain continued without stopping.

1052
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:32,359
When it's sunny, the river is a dream.

1053
01:07:32,359 --> 01:07:39,069
But when it's rainy, the river is brown and
unfriendly.

1054
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:42,090
It rained all day.

1055
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:45,549
At first, we pretended to enjoy it.

1056
01:07:45,549 --> 01:07:49,859
'Well, this is a nice change.

1057
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:52,260
Too much sunshine is boring.

1058
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:56,930
Nature is beautiful even when it rains,' I
said.

1059
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:02,450
'Yes,' Harris said, 'it's good to see the
river in all kinds of weather.

1060
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,170
The rain is good for you.

1061
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:08,690
I can't understand people who are afraid of
a little rain.'

1062
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:13,799
Harris and I sang songs and we were quite
happy.

1063
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:15,690
George did not agree.

1064
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,630
He stayed under the umbrella.

1065
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,370
We put up the canvas cover before lunch.

1066
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:26,570
We left a little opening to see where we were
going.

1067
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:31,520
We continued our trip for another nine miles.

1068
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,560
We stopped for the night at Day's Lock.

1069
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,500
We did not have a happy evening.

1070
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,100
The rain never stopped.

1071
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,390
Supper was not good.

1072
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,470
We were really tired of cold meat.

1073
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:53,520
We dreamt about our favourite foods.

1074
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,850
Harris talked about fish cooked in a special
sauce.

1075
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:02,570
Harris gave his cold meat to Montmorency.

1076
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:05,580
He looked at it and turned his head.

1077
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:11,120
He seemed insulted by Harris's offer.

1078
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,310
He went to sit at the other side of the boat,
alone.

1079
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:22,160
George said, 'Please don't talk about good
food, until I finish this cold meat.'

1080
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,880
We played cards after supper.

1081
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,870
After that, we had some hot water and whisky.

1082
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,440
George told us about a man he knew.

1083
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,770
This man had slept on the river in a wet boat,
like ours.

1084
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:41,140
He got very ill and died ten days later.

1085
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:46,680
Of course, we began talking about other illnesses.

1086
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,660
After a while, I Harris said, 'I've got an
awful headache.

1087
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,800
It must be the rain.'

1088
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:59,580
'Well, I've got a bad backache,' I said.

1089
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:04,040
To make us feel happier, George sang to us.

1090
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,370
That made Harris and I cry, and it made Montmorency
howl.

1091
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:14,740
There was nothing else to do, so we went to
bed.

1092
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,100
We didn't sleep well at all.

1093
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,380
We were awake at five o'clock the next morning.

1094
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,310
Our second rainy day was the same as the first.

1095
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,260
It rained all day.

1096
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,560
We moved slowly along the river.

1097
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,510
We agreed to continue our trip, even if it
killed us.

1098
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,930
'It's only two more days,' Harris said.

1099
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,060
'We're young and healthy.

1100
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,990
Maybe we'll be all right.'

1101
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,700
We talked about our evening.

1102
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:47,520
'With this weather, we can have dinner and
take a walk in the rain.

1103
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,710
Or, we can have dinner and spend an hour in
a pub,' I said.

1104
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,890
'That's not very exciting,' said George.

1105
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,620
'It's much more interesting to go to the Alhambra
Theatre in London,' said Harris.

1106
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:04,540
'And then have supper at that little French
restaurant,' I added.

1107
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:10,810
'But we have decided to stay and die on this
boat,' said George.

1108
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:16,150
'However, there's a train that leaves Pangbourne
after five o'clock.

1109
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:22,150
It gets to London in time to eat something,
and then go to the theatre.'

1110
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:24,180
Everyone was silent.

1111
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:27,720
We didn't say one word.

1112
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,620
We looked at one another.

1113
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:35,000
Then, we got out the big bag and got our clothes
ready.

1114
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,120
Twenty minutes later, three men and a dog
were going to the railway station.

1115
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,060
We lied to the boatman at Pangbourne.

1116
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:51,510
We didn't have the courage to tell him the
truth: we were running away from the rain!

1117
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:55,290
We asked him to take care of the boat until
the next morning.

1118
01:11:55,290 --> 01:12:03,730
'If something happens, we'll write to you,'
we said, telling him a big lie.

1119
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:08,000
We reached Paddington Station at seven o'clock.

1120
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,270
We went directly to the restaurant and had
a small meal.

1121
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:17,660
Montmorency stayed at the restaurant, while
we went to the theatre.

1122
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:23,190
'We'll return at half past ten for the dog
and for a good supper,' I told the restaurant

1123
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,420
owner.

1124
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:30,470
The man at the ticket office of the theatre
said, 'Oh, you're the famous acrobats from

1125
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,310
the Himalaya Mountains.

1126
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,200
You're late for the performance.

1127
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,160
Please use the side door.'

1128
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,900
We explained to him that we were not acrobats.

1129
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:44,660
He understood and sold us three tickets.

1130
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:49,930
Our clothes probably looked a bit old and
strange.

1131
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:55,840
At the Alhambra Theatre everyone looked at
our clothes and smiled.

1132
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,060
Some people laughed.

1133
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,410
After the theatre, we went back to the restaurant.

1134
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:07,560
We enjoyed our delicious supper.

1135
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:13,940
After ten days of eating cold meat, we were
thankful for this supper.

1136
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,910
We ate it without speaking.

1137
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:21,660
Then we sat back and felt happy and kind.

1138
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:28,260
Harris, who was sitting next to the window,
pulled back the curtain.

1139
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:32,730
He looked at the wet street.

1140
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,210
It was rainy and dark.

1141
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,730
The wind was blowing.

1142
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:44,390
A few people walked past under their umbrellas.

1143
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:52,020
Harris took his glass and said, 'Well, we
had a good trip, and I say thank you to Old

1144
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,910
Father Thames.

1145
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:58,600
But, I think we were right to come back when
we did.

1146
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,100
Here's to Three Men well out of a boat!'

1147
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,520
Montmorency stood on his back legs in front
of the window.

1148
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:14,060
He looked at the wet night and gave a short
bark of agreement.

1149
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,230
- THE END -
