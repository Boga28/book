1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,760
Maurice didn't think much or worry much.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,810
While he had the power of touch, he was happy
without sight.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:17,800
Isabel Pervin was listening for two sounds
- for the sound of wheels on the drive outside

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,800
and for the noise of her husband's footsteps
in the hall.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,660
It was the late afternoon of a rainy November
day.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,750
Her dearest and oldest friend was on his way
from the station.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,800
Her husband, who had been blinded in the war
in France, was outside somewhere.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,780
Maurice had been home for a year now.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,770
He was badly scared and totally blind, but
they had been very happy.

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,710
Grange Farm was Maurice's place.

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,280
The farm workers lived at the back of the
house, while Isabel lived with her husband

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,570
in the comfortable rooms at the front.

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,059
They had spent most of their time alone together
since his return.

14
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,930
They talked and sang and read, together.

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,780
She wrote short pieces for a newspaper and
he did some work on the farm - simple work,

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,970
it is true, but it gave him satisfaction.

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,870
He milked the cows and looked after the pigs
and horses.

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,960
Life was still very full for the blind man,
peaceful in darkness.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,990
With his wife, he had a whole world, rich
and real.

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,380
But sometimes their happiness left them.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,380
In that silent house, Isabel sometimes felt
she was going crazy.

22
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,140
And sometimes her husband became despairing.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,000
She tried then to force the old cheerfulness
to continue bat the effort was almost too

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,420
much for her.

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:06,750
At such times, she would give anything, anything,
to escape.

26
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,060
She looked for a way out.

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,450
She invited friends.

28
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,219
She tried to give her husband some further
connection with the outside world.

29
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,629
But it was no good.

30
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,739
Nobody could understand the depth of the experiences
that they had shared in the past year.

31
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:31,349
But now, in a few weeks' time, her second
baby would be born.

32
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,730
The first had died while her husband was in
France.

33
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,340
She looked forward with pleasure to the coming
of the second, but she also felt a little

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,220
anxious.

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,379
The child would take her love and attention.

36
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,240
And then, what about Maurice?

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,329
What would he do?

38
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:57,760
It was at this time that Isabel's old friend,
Bertie Reid,, wrote to her.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,909
All her life he had been her friend - like
a brother, but better than her own brothers.

40
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:11,030
She loved him, though not in the same way
as the man she had chosen to marry.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,629
Bertie was a lawyer, a thoughtful type with
a quick mind Maurice was different.

42
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,230
He was slow and sensitive - a big, heavy man.

43
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,040
The two men had never been close.

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,719
Isabel thought they should like each other.

45
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,180
But they did not.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,840
So when Maurice was going out to France, she
wrote to Bertie saying that she must end her

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,569
friendship with him.

48
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:43,420
For nearly two years, there had been no communication
between the two friends.

49
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,430
Then a little note came from Bertie.

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,159
He wrote of the real pain he felt about Maurice's
blindness.

51
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,059
Isabel felt a nervous excitement again, and
she read the letter to Maurice.

52
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,370
'Ask him to come down,' he said.

53
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,719
'Ask Bertie to come here?'

54
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,819
'Yes - if he wants to.'

55
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,340
Isabel thought about this.

56
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,629
'I know he wants to,' she replied.

57
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,779
'But what about you, Maurice?

58
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,900
How would you like it?'

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,190
'I should like it.'

60
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,000
'Well - in that case - But I thought you didn't
care for him-'

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,419
"Oh, I don't know.

62
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:35,009
I might think differently of him now," the
blind man replied.

63
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:41,290
So Bertie was coming, coming this evening,
in the November rain and.

64
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,750
darkness.

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,050
Isabel looked nervously again at the high
windows, where the rain was beating against

66
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,849
the glass.

67
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,150
Maurice was out in the stable.

68
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,560
She stood up and looked at herself in the
mirror.

69
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,389
Her face was calm.

70
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,400
Her neck made a beautiful line to her shoulder.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,450
She had a warm, motherly look.

72
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,680
She passed down the wide hall and put on heavy
shoes, a large coat and a man's hat.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,690
Then she went outside.

74
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,400
It was very dark and very windy.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,950
As she walked on, the darkness seemed deeper,
and she was sorry she had not brought a lamp.

76
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,540
Rain blew against her.

77
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,789
She half liked it and she half felt that she
did not want to light against it.

78
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,539
She reached the door of the stable.

79
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:41,960
There was no light anywhere.

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,610
She opened the door and looked in, into total
darkness.

81
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,099
The sudden smell of horses shocked her.

82
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:58,930
She listened but could only hear the night
and the restless movement of a horse.

83
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,150
'Maurice!'

84
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,810
she called softly.

85
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,389
'Maurice - are you there?'

86
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,419
Nothing came from the darkness.

87
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:15,740
The rain and the wind were blowing in, so
she entered and shut the door.

88
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,150
She was conscious of the horses, though she
could not see them, and she was afraid.

89
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,439
Then she heard a small noise in the distance.

90
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,020
It was Maurice in the other part of the stable.

91
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,979
The low sound of his voice as he spoke to
the horses came to her in the darkness.

92
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,020
She called quietly, 'Maurice, Maurice - dear!'

93
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,879
'Yes,' he answered.

94
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,939
'Isabel?'

95
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,180
She saw nothing, and the sound of his voice
seemed to touch her.

96
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,330
'Won't you come in, dear?'

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,169
she said.

98
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,250
'Yes, I'm coming.

99
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,300
Just half a minute.

100
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,129
Bertie hasn't arrived yet, has he?'

101
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,900
'Not yet,' said Isabel.

102
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,680
She wanted him to come to her.

103
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,170
When she could not see him, she was frightened
of him.

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:23,480
'Bertie won't much enjoy the drive in this
weather,' he said, as he closed the door.

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:32,440
'No, he won't!' said Isabel calmly, watching
the dark shape at the door.

106
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,270
'Give me your arm, dear.'

107
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,810
Isabel was pleased to be back in the house.

108
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,020
She was a little afraid of him out there in
the darkness.

109
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,919
In the hall, he sat down heavily.

110
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,070
As he bent down to take off his boots, he
didn't seem blind.

111
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,130
When he stood up, the blood rushed to his
face and neck, and she didn't look at his

112
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,780
eyes.

113
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,080
He went away upstairs.

114
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,979
She saw him go into the darkness.

115
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,199
He did not know that the lamps upstairs were
not lit.

116
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,620
She heard him in the bathroom.

117
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,139
Maurice moved around almost unconsciously.

118
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,750
He seemed to know where things were before
he touched them.

119
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,099
He didn't think much or worry much.

120
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:27,900
While he had the power of touch, he was happy
without sight.

121
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,060
It was a pleasure to stretch out his hands
and pick up something that he couldn't see,

122
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,659
to hold it and to own it.

123
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,139
He didn't try to remember what it looked like.

124
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,120
He didn't want to.

125
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,800
This new consciousness had become natural
to him.

126
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,930
He was generally happy and he had a burning
love for Isabel.

127
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,440
But at times despair swept over him and destroyed
his happiness.

128
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,360
Then he suffered.

129
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,180
But tonight he was still calm, though his
senses were a little sharp.

130
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,140
His hearing was too sharp.

131
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,430
He was conscious of all the sounds in the
house.

132
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,420
As he went to his room, he heard a vehicle
arrive.

133
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,630
Then came Isabel's voice, like a bell ringing.

134
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,950
'Is it you, Bertie?'

135
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,690
And a man's voice answered out of the wind.

136
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,130
'Hello, Isabel.

137
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,290
There you are.

138
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,620
You're looking as fit as ever.'

139
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,550
'Oh yes,' said Isabel.

140
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,440
'I'm very well.

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,420
How are you?

142
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Rather thin, I think -'

143
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,250
'Worked, to death.

144
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,360
But I'm all right.

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,710
How's Maurice?

146
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,230
Isn't he here?'

147
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,450
'Oh yes, he's upstairs, changing his clothes.

148
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,450
Yes, he's well.'

149
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,459
They moved away.

150
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,020
Maurice heard no more.

151
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,570
But a childish sense of despair had come over
him.

152
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,370
He felt shut out- like a child in the company
of adults.

153
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,410
He dressed himself and went downstairs.

154
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,779
Isabel was alone in the sitting room.

155
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,990
She watched him enter.

156
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,550
'Did you hear Bertie come, Maurice?'

157
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,130
she said.

158
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,410
'Yes - isn't he here?'

159
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,900
'He's in his room.

160
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,990
He looks very thin and tired.'

161
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,260
Bertie came down.

162
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:48,240
He was a little dark man, with a very big
forehead, thin hair, and sad, large eyes.

163
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,730
He had strange, short legs.

164
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:57,300
Isabel watched him pause at the door, and
look nervously at her husband.

165
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,970
Bertie went across to Maurice.

166
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,290
The blind man put his hand out and Bertie
took it.

167
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,790
Isabel watched them anxiously, and then looked
away again.

168
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,019
'Come,' she said.

169
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,720
'Come to the table.

170
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,850
Aren't you both hungry?'

171
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,560
They sat down.

172
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,620
Maurice felt for his place, his knife and
fork.

173
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,290
Bertie picked up a little bowl of flowers
from the table, and held them to his nose.

174
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,880
'They have a lovely sweet smell,' he said.

175
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,040
'Where do they come from?'

176
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,029
'From the garden - under the windows.

177
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,740
Bertie, do you remember the flowers under
Aunt Bell's wall?'

178
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,310
The two friends looked at each other and smiled.

179
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,880
The meal continued and Isabel and Bertie spoke
easily together.

180
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,220
The blind man was silent.

181
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,750
He ate carefully but quickly.

182
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,670
He could never accept any help.

183
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,370
After the meal, the three sat around the fire.

184
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:13,200
Isabel put more wood on and Bertie noticed
a slight slowness in her movements.

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,750
'Will you be pleased when the child comes,
Isabel?' he said.

186
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,260
She looked at him with a smile.

187
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,870
'Yes, I shall be very pleased.

188
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,959
So will you, Maurice, won't you?'

189
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,959
she added.

190
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,389
'Yes, I shall,' replied her husband.

191
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:39,760
'We are both looking forward to it so much,'
she said.

192
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,470
'Yes, of course,' said Bertie.

193
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,350
He was three or four years older than Isabel
and had never married.

194
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,920
He had other women friends - but they were
friends, not lovers.

195
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,750
If they seemed to come too close, he pulled
away.

196
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,440
Isabel knew him very well, his kindness, but
also his weakness, which made him unable ever

197
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,510
to enter into any close human relationships.

198
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,949
He was ashamed of himself because he couldn't
marry.

199
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:19,089
He wanted to, but he couldn't.

200
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,320
Deep down inside he was afraid.

201
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,149
He became a successful lawyer, a rich man
and a great social success.

202
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:33,760
But at the centre he felt that he was nothing.

203
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,480
Isabel looked at his sad face and his short
little legs.

204
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,080
She looked at his dark grey eyes.

205
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,149
There was something childlike in him and she
loved him.

206
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:53,050
At the same time, she pitied and disliked
his weakness.

207
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,800
He understood this.

208
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,990
Suddenly, Bertie spoke to Maurice.

209
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,880
'Isabel tells me that you have not suffered
too badly from losing your sight.'

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,199
Maurice straightened himself.

211
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,410
'No,' he said, 'not too badly.

212
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,060
You stop worrying about many things.'

213
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,899
'And that is good,' said Bertie.

214
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,790
'But what is it that takes the place of worry?'

215
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,320
Maurice was slow in replying.

216
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,649
'There is something,' Maurice said.

217
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,630
'But I couldn't tell you what it is.'

218
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,790
Then the blind man was silent.

219
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,839
He stood up slowly, a big, uncomfortable figure.

220
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,460
He wanted to go away.

221
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,870
'Do you mind,' he said, 'if I go and speak
to the farm manager?

222
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,540
I won't be long.'

223
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,769
'No - go along, dear,' said Isabel.

224
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,880
And he went out.

225
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,410
A silence came over the two friends.

226
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,850
The wind blew loudly outside.

227
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,899
Rain beat like a drum on the windows.

228
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:19,589
The wood in the fireplace burned lowly with
hot small flames.

229
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:20,880
Bertie seemed uncomfortable.

230
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,130
There were dark circles around his eyes.

231
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,420
Isabel looked into the fire.

232
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,019
'The child coming seems to make me calm.

233
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,769
I feel there's nothing to worry about,' she
said.

234
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:44,670
'A good thing, I should say,' Bertie replied
slowly.

235
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:53,310
'If I didn't feel anxious about Maurice, I'd
be quite happy.'

236
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,550
The evening passed slowly.

237
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,910
Isabel looked at the clock.

238
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,000
'It's nearly ten o'clock,' she said.

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,720
'Where can Maurice be?'

240
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,860
Bertie looked at her.

241
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,220
'Would you like me to go out and see?'

242
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,720
'Well - if you wouldn't mind.

243
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,160
I'd go, but -' She did not want to make the
effort.

244
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,020
Bertie put on an old coat and took a lamp.

245
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,990
He left by the side door.

246
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,900
He felt nervous and strangely empty.

247
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,210
He walked slowly through the wet and stormy
right.

248
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:41,089
At last, he opened the door of a stable and,
looking in, he saw Maurice standing, listening.

249
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,769
'Who is that?' said Maurice.

250
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,779
'It's me,' said Bertie.

251
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:52,279
He entered and shut the door behind him.

252
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,519
'You came to look for me?' he asked.

253
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,490
'Isabel was a little worried, said Bertie.

254
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,740
'I'll come in.'

255
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,309
'I hope I'm not in your way at all,' said
Bertie, rather shyly.

256
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:11,059
'My way?'

257
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,079
Maurice said.

258
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,919
'Not a bit.

259
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm pleased Isabel has someone to talk to.

260
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,559
I'm afraid that I am in the way.

261
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,089
I know I'm not very good company.

262
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,780
Is Isabel all right, do you think?

263
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,260
She's not unhappy, is she?'

264
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,450
'I don't think so.'

265
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,299
'What does she say?'

266
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:44,130
'She says she's very happy - only a little
worried about you,' said Bertie carefully.

267
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,700
'She needn't worry about me.

268
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm afraid that she'll find me dull, always
alone with me down here.'

269
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,120
Maurice lowered his voice and took a deep
breath.

270
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:11,750
'Bertie,' he asked, 'is my face a very ugly
sight?

271
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,530
Do you mind telling me?'

272
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,700
'There is a scar,' said.

273
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,539
Bertie, surprised.

274
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:24,059
'But one feels pity more than shock at the
sight of it.'

275
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:32,070
'A bad scar, though,' said Maurice.

276
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,750
'Oh, yes.'

277
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,380
There was a pause.

278
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,120
'I don't really know you, do I?'

279
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,460
Maurice said suddenly in a strange voice.

280
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,409
'Probably not,' said Bertie.

281
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:52,530
'Do you mind if I touch you?'

282
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:58,950
Bertie stepped back but said, in a small voice,
'Not at all.'

283
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:04,549
He suffered as the blind man stretched out
a strong hand and felt his head.

284
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:11,919
He covered the face of the smaller man, touching
the forehead, the closed eyes, the small nose,

285
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,020
the mouth, the strong chin.

286
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:23,039
'You seem young,' Maurice said quietly, at
last.

287
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,150
Bertie stood, nearly destroyed, unable to
answer.

288
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,580
'Your head seems soft,' Maurice continued.

289
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,490
'So do your hands.

290
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,630
Touch my eyes, will you?

291
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,630
Touch my scar.'

292
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:55,760
Bertie was sickened by the idea, but he was
under the power of the blind man.

293
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,880
He lifted his hand, and touched the scar.

294
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Maurice suddenly covered it with his own hand,
pressed the fingers of the other man onto

295
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,500
his scarred eyes.

296
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:14,289
He stayed in this position for a minute or
more while Bertie froze, helpless.

297
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:21,480
Then, suddenly, Maurice took the other man's
hand away and stood holding it in his own.

298
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,320
'Oh my God,' he said.

299
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,929
'We shall know each other now, shan't we?

300
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,640
We shall know each other now.'

301
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,059
Bertie could not answer.

302
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:44,040
He looked at the blind man silently and in
terror, despairing at his own weakness.

303
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,100
He knew that he could not answer.

304
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,059
He had an unreasonable fear that the other
man would suddenly destroy him.

305
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:58,730
Maurice was actually filled with a burning
desire for friendship - and Bertie only wanted

306
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,990
to escape.

307
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,230
'It's all right now, as long as we live.

308
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,230
We're all right together now, aren't we?'

309
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,950
Maurice said.

310
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,610
'Yes,' said Bertie.

311
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,179
Maurice turned to pick up his coat.

312
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,240
'Come,' he said, 'we'll go to Isabel.'

313
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,590
Bertie took the lamp and opened the door.

314
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,890
The two men went in silence.

315
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,960
Isabel heard their footsteps and looked up
anxiously as they entered.

316
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,850
There seemed a strange happiness in Maurice.

317
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,840
Bertie looked tired.

318
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,289
His eyes were darker than before.

319
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:47,590
'What is it?'

320
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,850
she asked.

321
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,059
'We've become friends,' said Maurice.

322
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,960
She looked at Bertie.

323
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,870
He met her eyes with a despairing look.

324
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,080
'I'm so pleased,' she said, confused.

325
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,520
'Yes,' said Maurice.

326
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,549
Isabel took his hand with both of hers and
held it tight.

327
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,730
'You'll be happier now, dear,' she said.

328
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,669
But she was watching Bertie.

329
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:28,260
She knew that he had one desire - to escape
from this friendship, which had been forced

330
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,780
on him.

331
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,669
He could not accept that he had been touched
by the blind man.
