00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,920
THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,160
A Few Words to Begin
Most of the ADVENTURES in this book really

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
happened.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,789
One or two were my own experiences.

5
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,600
The others were experiences of boys in my
school.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,450
Huck Finn really lived.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,690
Tom Sawyer is made of three real boys.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:28,190
My book is for boys and girls, but I hope
that men and women also will read it.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,820
I hope that it will help them to remember
pleasantly the days when they were boys and

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,719
girls, and how they felt and thought and talked,
what they believed, and what strange things

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,180
they sometimes did.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,670
MARK TWAIN

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
in the State of Connecticut,
Hartford 1876

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,670
Aunt Polly Decides Her Duty

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,670
“Tom!”

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,670
No answer.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,670
“TOM!”

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,670
No answer.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,670
The old lady looked around the room.

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,670
“When I find you, I—”

21
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,670
She did not finish.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,670
With her head down, she was looking under
the bed.

23
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,670
Only the cat came out.

24
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,670
She went to the open door and looked toward
the garden.

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,670
No Tom was there.

26
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,670
She shouted:

27
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,670
“You, Tom!”

28
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,670
There was a little noise behind her.

29
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
She turned and caught a small boy, stopping
him before he could escape.

30
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,670
“What were you doing in that corner?”

31
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,670
“Nothing.”

32
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,670
“Nothing!

33
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,670
What is that on your hands and face?”

34
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,670
“I do not know, Aunt Polly.”

35
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,670
“I know.

36
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,670
You have been eating sweets.

37
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,670
I have told you a hundred times not to eat
those sweets.”

38
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,670
Her hand was raised in the air—it started
down—it was very near—

39
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,670
“Oh!

40
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,670
Look behind you, Aunt!”

41
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
The old lady turned.

42
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,670
The boy ran.

43
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,670
In a moment he was up on the high board fence.

44
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,670
Then he was on the far side of it.

45
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,670
His Aunt Polly was surprised.

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,670
Then she laughed a little.

47
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,670
“That boy!

48
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,670
I never know what he will do next.

49
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,670
And he knows that I do not want to hit him.

50
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,670
But I should.

51
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,670
And if he does not go to school this afternoon,
I must make him work tomorrow.

52
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,670
He does not like work.

53
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,670
Especially on Saturday, when there is no school,
he does not like work.

54
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,670
All the other boys will be playing.

55
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,670
But I must try to make him a good boy.

56
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,670
He is my dead sister’s son, and it is my
duty.

57
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,670
I must do my duty.”

58
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,670
Tom did not go to school and he had a very
happy afternoon.

59
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,670
He came home late.

60
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,670
He hurried to do his share of the evening
work.

61
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,670
His brother Sid had already finished his share.

62
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,670
Sid was a quiet boy, who had no adventures
and also no troubles.

63
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,670
While Tom sat eating, his Aunt Polly asked
questions.

64
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,670
She hoped to learn about his afternoon.

65
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,670
“Tom, was it warm in school?”

66
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,670
“Yes, Aunt Polly.”

67
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,670
“Did you wish to go swimming, Tom?”

68
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,670
Tom began to feel afraid.

69
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,670
What did she know about his afternoon?

70
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,670
“No, Aunt Polly.

71
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,670
Not very much.”

72
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,670
She touched his shirt.

73
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,840
It was dry.

74
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,280
But Tom knew what she would touch next.

75
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,420
He said quickly, “Some of us put water on
our heads because we were hot.

76
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,170
My hair is not dry yet.”

77
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,480
He watched her face.

78
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,990
Yes, she believed him.

79
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,170
He was safe.

80
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,670
And Aunt Polly was glad to believe that he
had been good.

81
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,490
The summer evenings were long.

82
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,030
Tom walked along the street, whistling like
a bird.

83
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,740
Then he stopped whistling.

84
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,820
He had met a stranger, a boy a little larger
than he was.

85
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,650
The boy’s clothes were new and good, and
he was wearing shoes.

86
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,730
Tom would wear shoes and good clothes like
these only to church on Sunday.

87
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,780
Tom looked and looked.

88
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,270
The boy’s clothes seemed to become better
and better, and his own clothes seemed to

89
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,810
grow poorer.

90
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,910
Neither boy spoke.

91
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,600
If one moved, then the other moved.

92
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,000
But they moved only to the side, in a circle.

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,470
They remained face to face and eye to eye.

94
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,500
Then Tom said:

95
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,930
“I can beat you!”

96
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,930
“Try.”

97
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,930
“I can.”

98
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,160
“No, you can’t.”

99
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,780
“Yes, I can.”

100
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,400
“No, you can’t.”

101
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,480
“I can.”

102
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
“You can’t.”

103
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
“Can!”

104
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
“Can’t!”

105
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
A moment of quiet.

106
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,670
Then Tom said:

107
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,960
“I could beat you with one hand.”

108
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,390
“Do it.

109
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,561
You say you can do it.”

110
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:08,561
“That hat!”

111
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:11,780
“Hit it off my head if you can.”

112
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,190
“I will.”

113
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,860
“You are afraid.”

114
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,820
“I am not afraid.”

115
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,040
“You are.”

116
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,870
“I am not.”

117
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,090
“You are.”

118
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,050
More moving in a circle.

119
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,190
Now they were shoulder to shoulder, each trying
to make the other fall back.

120
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,239
And then suddenly they were both rolling in
the dust.

121
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,000
Each pulled at the other’s hair, and each
hit the other’s nose.

122
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,850
And now through the dust Tom appeared, sitting
on the new boy, beating him with hard, closed

123
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,850
hands.

124
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,880
“Have you had enough?” said he.

125
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,100
The boy tried to get free.

126
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,650
He was weeping with anger.

127
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,569
“Have you had enough?”

128
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,470
Then the new boy said, “Enough!”

129
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,239
Tom let him stand up and walk away.

130
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,930
But as soon as Tom turned, the new boy threw
a stone, hitting Tom’s back.

131
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,950
Therefore, Tom followed him home, and waited.

132
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,020
The boy did not come out again.

133
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,880
His mother came and said that Tom was a bad
child.

134
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,349
She told him to go home.

135
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,370
It was late when Tom got there.

136
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,730
Very quietly and carefully, he entered through
a window.

137
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,340
But his aunt was waiting for him.

138
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,760
She had learned from Sid about Tom’s afternoon.

139
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,940
Now she saw his clothes and she knew that
he had been fighting.

140
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,530
She knew what she must do.

141
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:36,060
Tom would work all day on Saturday.

142
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,050
Strong Desire — Wise Action

143
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,740
Saturday morning came.

144
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,639
All the summer world was bright and fresh
and full of life.

145
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,630
Tom appeared in front of the house with paint
and a big brush.

146
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,080
He looked at the fence, and all joy left him.

147
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,160
A deep sadness settled upon his heart.

148
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,710
The fence was long and high.

149
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,030
He wet the brush and moved it along the top
board.

150
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,410
He did it again, and did it again.

151
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,730
He looked at what he had done.

152
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,770
The painted part was very, very small.

153
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,470
The whole fence was very large.

154
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,290
He sat down.

155
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,420
He felt that he could not continue.

156
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,990
Jim, a boy who worked for the family, came
through the gate.

157
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,979
He was going to get water, and he was singing
happily.

158
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,520
Tom said, “Jim, I will get the water, if
you will paint.”

159
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,110
Jim said, “No.

160
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,840
I must get the water.”

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,430
“Are you afraid of Aunt Polly?

162
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,950
She won’t hurt you.

163
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,550
She talks about it, but talk never hurts.

164
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,070
It never hurts except when she weeps, also.

165
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,389
You should not be afraid of her.

166
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:54,310
Jim, I will give you one of my playthings.

167
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,480
And I will show you my foot.

168
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,949
I will show you where I hurt it.”

169
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,300
Jim was only human.

170
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,370
He took the plaything and he put his head
down to look at the foot.

171
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,220
In another moment he was running down the
street.

172
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,470
Tom was painting as fast as possible.

173
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,050
And Aunt Polly was returning to the house.

174
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,630
But Tom began to think of the pleasure planned
for this day.

175
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,009
His hands moved more slowly.

176
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,210
Soon the other boys would come and laugh at
him for working.

177
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,350
From his pocket he took everything that he
owned.

178
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,169
He looked at it.

179
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,830
There was nothing of real value.

180
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,720
It was not enough to buy another boy’s help.

181
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,530
At this dark moment, a wonderful idea came
to him.

182
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,020
It was like a great, bright light.

183
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,460
He took his brush and went quietly to work.

184
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,380
Ben Rogers appeared soon.

185
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,550
Tom had been especially afraid of Ben’s
laugh.

186
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,180
Ben was eating an apple.

187
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,980
Also as he walked, he was making noises like
those of a big riverboat.

188
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,350
He would shout loudly.

189
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,710
Then he would say, “Ding-dong-dong,” like
a bell.

190
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:20,270
Then he would shout again, and say, “Ding-dong-dong,”
again, and make other strange noises.

191
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,630
He was the boat, and he was the captain of
the boat, and the boat bell.

192
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,940
“Turn her!” he shouted.

193
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,240
“Slow her!

194
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Stop!”

195
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:36,990
He made a slow, careful turn, came close beside
Tom, and stopped.

196
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,920
Tom continued his painting.

197
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,830
He did not look at the boat.

198
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,830
Ben said, “Hello!

199
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,830
You are in trouble.”

200
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,330
No answer.

201
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,770
Tom moved his brush gently, and looked at
the result.

202
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,510
Ben came nearer.

203
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,870
Tom wished for the apple, but he did not turn
from his work.

204
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,000
Ben said:

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,319
“Hello, you must work, must you?”

206
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,610
Tom turned suddenly.

207
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,830
“Oh, Ben, is it you?

208
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,240
I did not see you.”

209
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,100
“I am going swimming, I am.

210
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,550
Do you wish you could go with me?

211
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,100
Or would you rather work?”

212
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,470
Tom said, “What do you mean?

213
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,470
Work?”

214
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,110
“That is work.”

215
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,370
Tom returned to his painting.

216
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,830
“It may be work and it may not be.

217
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,380
But it is fine for Tom Sawyer.”

218
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,110
“Do you mean that you enjoy it?”

219
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,110
“Enjoy it?

220
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,280
Does a boy have a chance to paint a fence
every day?”

221
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,460
Here was a new idea.

222
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,620
Ben stopped eating his apple.

223
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,610
Tom moved his brush—stepped away to look
at the result—added a little paint here

224
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,279
and there—stepped away again.

225
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,270
Ben watched.

226
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,320
He was more and more interested.

227
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Then he said:

228
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,629
“Tom, let me paint a little.”

229
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:01,629
Tom thought.

230
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,920
Then he said, “No, Ben.

231
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect.

232
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,930
If it was the fence behind the house, you
could help.

233
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,050
But this fence, beside the street, must be
done very carefully.

234
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,730
There is not one boy in a thousand who can
do it well.”

235
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,370
“Oh, Tom, let me try.

236
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,370
Only a little.

237
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,370
I will be careful.

238
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,410
Tom, I will give you part of my apple.”

239
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,410
“No, Ben.

240
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,410
I am afraid—”

241
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,690
“I will give you all of it!”

242
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,530
Tom gave the brush to Ben slowly, but with
joy in his heart.

243
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,440
And, while the boy who a few moments before
had been a riverboat worker and became hot

244
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:48,230
in the sun, Tom sat under the tree, eating
the apple and planning how to get more help.

245
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,980
There were enough boys.

246
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,050
They came along the street, stopped to laugh,
but remained to paint.

247
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,810
After Ben, Bill Fisher painted.

248
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,910
Then Johnny Miller came.

249
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,880
Each one paid to be allowed to work.

250
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,430
In the middle of the afternoon, Tom was very
rich.

251
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,860
He had many playthings, a small cat with one
eye, a piece of broken blue glass, and much

252
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,470
more.

253
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,710
And he had not worked, and the whole fence
had been painted three times.

254
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,510
There was no more paint.

255
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,290
With more paint, Tom would soon have owned
everything belonging to the other boys.

256
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,330
And the other boys in the village would have
owned nothing.

257
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,220
Tom had discovered a great law of human action.

258
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:41,320
A man or a boy will desire something if it
is not easy to get.

259
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,370
Tom as an Army Officer — Delightful Sadness

260
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,810
Tom went to report to Aunt Polly.

261
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,350
She was sitting beside an open window.

262
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,700
She was half asleep, and she was holding the
sleeping cat.

263
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,990
She was surprised to see Tom.

264
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,580
She thought that he had run away from his
work long ago.

265
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,910
Tom said, “May I go and play now, Aunt?”

266
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,910
“Already?

267
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,279
How much have you done?”

268
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,270
“It is all done, Aunt.”

269
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,720
“Tom, is that true?

270
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,190
It makes me sad if you do not tell the truth.”

271
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,459
“It is true, Aunt; it is all done.”

272
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,020
She went to see, and her surprise was very
great.

273
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,930
“You can work when you want to, Tom.

274
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,089
But you do not often want to.

275
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,090
Go and play.

276
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,950
But remember to come home again.”

277
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,670
And she gave him a large apple.

278
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,089
She did not see him take a piece of cake as
he passed through the kitchen.

279
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,010
Tom hurried to the center of the village.

280
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,089
There two armies of boys had met for a battle.

281
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:47,370
Tom was the leader, the General, of one army,
and his good friend, Joe Harper, was the General

282
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,960
of the other.

283
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,100
Tom and Joe did not fight.

284
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,850
They sat together and sent their orders to
the armies.

285
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,730
When the battle was finished, they agreed
to have another battle on another day.

286
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,900
Then the armies marched away, and Tom started
to go home alone.

287
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,180
As he passed Jeff Thatcher’s house, he saw
a new girl in the garden.

288
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,810
She had blue eyes and yellow hair.

289
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,860
She was beautiful.

290
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,350
Tom had loved a girl named Amy Lawrence.

291
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,329
A week ago she had said that she loved him.

292
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,430
He had been happy and proud.

293
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,010
But now in a moment she was gone from his
heart.

294
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,370
He watched the new girl until she discovered
him.

295
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,360
Then he looked at other places, as if he had
not seen her.

296
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
And he began to jump, and dance, and walk
on his hands, so that she would continue to

297
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,160
watch him.

298
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,640
She walked toward the house, and Tom’s heart
was sad.

299
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,050
But she threw a flower over the fence.

300
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,580
Then she was gone.

301
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,529
Tom looked around.

302
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,360
There was no person to see him.

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,340
Slowly he picked up the flower.

304
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,480
He put it under his shirt, near his heart.

305
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,610
And he stayed near the fence until darkness
came.

306
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,350
Then he went home to eat.

307
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,630
He was full of joy.

308
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,980
His aunt wondered why.

309
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,100
Later that evening his brother Sid was a bad
boy.

310
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,990
He took some sweets.

311
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,910
But his aunt did not believe that Sid could
be bad.

312
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,160
She gave Tom the blow that she should have
given to Sid.

313
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,839
She learned the truth later, and was sorry.

314
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,620
But she said nothing to Tom.

315
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,970
Therefore, Tom was very sorry for himself.

316
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,110
He began to wish that he would die.

317
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,920
She would feel sorry then.

318
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,100
He could see himself being carried home from
the river, dead, his hair wet, his troubles

319
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,300
past.

320
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,590
He went out into the darkness, and went to
the river.

321
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,950
It would be good to drown—if he could drown
without pain.

322
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,930
He thought of his flower, and took it from
inside his shirt.

323
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,570
Would the new girl be sad if he died?

324
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,450
Would she put her arms around him?

325
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,070
Or would she turn coldly away?

326
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,640
This picture brought him much delightful suffering.

327
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,550
He kept it a long time in his mind.

328
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,320
Then he started home.

329
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,010
He stopped near the Thatcher house.

330
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,149
There was a light in one window.

331
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,290
Was that the new girl’s room?

332
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,700
He lay down on the ground below the window,
with her flower in his hands.

333
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,930
He would lie there and die in the cold.

334
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,329
In the morning, she would look out the window,
and see him.

335
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,019
The window opened suddenly.

336
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,970
He heard the voice of a woman who worked for
the Thatchers.

337
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,230
She threw water out of the window, and it
fell on him.

338
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,779
Tom jumped up and ran.

339
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:11,070
Sid opened his eyes and saw Tom, ready for
bed, looking at his wet clothes.

340
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,550
Tom’s wild eyes made Sid afraid.

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,540
He did not dare to speak.

342
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:24,139
But he would remember and tell his aunt.

343
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,470
Going to Sunday School

344
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,600
The sun rose upon a quiet world and looked
warmly down upon the peaceful village.

345
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,010
The family began the day by praying together.

346
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,829
Then Tom did his Sunday studying.

347
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,920
He was trying to learn some words from the
Bible.

348
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,839
Sid had already finished his studying, but
Tom was slow.

349
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,080
His mind was busy with other things.

350
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,690
Tom was learning five verses.

351
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,250
Some verses are long and some are short.

352
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,180
Tom had found five short verses.

353
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,510
Aunt Polly’s daughter, Mary, helped him,
and after a time, he could say the verses

354
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,290
without looking at the book.

355
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,490
Mary gave him a knife for studying so well.

356
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:15,400
It was not a good knife, but it was a knife.

357
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,960
Tom was deeply delighted.

358
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,290
Then Mary helped him to dress in his Sunday
clothes.

359
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,449
He hoped that she would forget his shoes.

360
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:28,899
But she did not.

361
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,779
When they were ready, the three children went
to Sunday school.

362
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,240
With his whole heart, Tom wished not to go.

363
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,360
Mary and Sid enjoyed going.

364
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,300
At the church door Tom stopped to speak to
a friend.

365
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,020
“Billy, do you have a yellow ticket?”

366
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
“Yes.”

367
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,730
“Will you sell it to me?”

368
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,050
“What will you pay for it?”

369
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,770
Tom offered enough, and received the ticket.

370
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:58,399
Then Tom stopped other boys, and bought more
tickets, some red and some blue.

371
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,910
He was busy with this buying for about ten
minutes.

372
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,980
Then he went into the church.

373
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,149
These tickets were given for learning the
Bible verses.

374
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:12,240
A blue ticket was given for two verses.

375
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,029
A red ticket was equal to ten blue tickets.

376
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,029
A yellow ticket was equal to ten red tickets.

377
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:25,879
And for ten yellow tickets, for learning two
thousand verses, the Sunday school teacher

378
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,619
gave the student a Bible.

379
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,370
It was a wonderful day when a boy or a girl
received one of these Bibles.

380
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,600
Perhaps Tom did not want the Bible.

381
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,799
But he did want the wonderful experience of
receiving it.

382
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,710
“Now, children,” the teacher said, “sit
up as straight as possible, and listen.

383
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,249
That is what good little boys and girls should
do.”

384
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:54,850
While the teacher was talking, three gentlemen
and a lady entered the church.

385
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,509
The lady was leading a child.

386
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,820
When Tom saw this small girl, waves of happiness
went over him.

387
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:11,679
He began hitting other boys, pulling their
hair, doing everything to force the new girl

388
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,149
to look at him and smile.

389
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:22,749
He was quickly forgetting the water the woman
threw from her window the night before.

390
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:29,279
The gentlemen and the lady went to the front
of the church and sat down there.

391
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,369
Then the teacher told who they were.

392
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:35,919
One gentleman was Mr. Thatcher, who lived
in the village.

393
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,460
All knew him.

394
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:43,100
But one was his brother, the great Judge Thatcher.

395
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:52,879
He had traveled, he had seen the world, he
came from a large town twelve miles away.

396
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:59,889
The teacher wished that on this day he could
give some boy or girl a Bible.

397
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,200
He would have been proud to do that.

398
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,580
The famous Judge Thatcher would know, then,
that this was a fine Sunday school.

399
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,779
But no child had enough yellow tickets.

400
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,220
At this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer
came forward.

401
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,480
He had nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets,
and ten blue tickets.

402
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,100
It was like a storm coming from a clear sky.

403
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,309
The teacher had not expected Tom to gather
so many tickets in ten years, but here were

404
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,499
the tickets.

405
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:41,619
It was the surprise of the year.

406
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,109
The teacher knew that it was strange.

407
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:49,109
He could not understand how it had happened.

408
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:53,109
He did not believe that Tom had learned two
thousand verses.

409
00:19:53,109 --> 00:20:00,789
He did not believe that Tom had learned twelve
verses.

410
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:01,929
The other boys watched Tom.

411
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:05,139
All wished that they, too, had enough tickets
for a Bible.

412
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:11,149
Some boys suffered more deeply, because they
had sold Tom their tickets.

413
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:15,169
They were able to understand what had happened.

414
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,960
Tom had become rich by letting other boys
whitewash the fence.

415
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,860
He had been rich enough to buy their tickets.

416
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,879
And now anger filled them.

417
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,880
They saw clearly what fools they had been.

418
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,009
Tom stood in a place of honor beside the Judge.

419
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,789
The Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and
called him a fine little man.

420
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,789
Tom could not speak.

421
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,070
His breath would not come.

422
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,440
His heart was shaking.

423
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,580
This was partly because the Judge was a great
man, but it was chiefly because the Judge

424
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,919
was her father.

425
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,029
The Judge asked his name.

426
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,029
“Tom.”

427
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,289
“Is that all of it?”

428
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:03,289
“Thomas.”

429
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,070
“But you have more, perhaps?

430
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,070
Another name?”

431
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,619
“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,”
said the teacher.

432
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,619
“Thomas Sawyer.”

433
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,429
“That is a good boy.

434
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:21,279
You are a fine, manly little fellow.

435
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,779
Two thousand verses is a very, very great
many.

436
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,610
And you never can be sorry that you learned
them.

437
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,510
Learning makes great men and good men.

438
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,880
You will be a great man and a good man some
day, Thomas.

439
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
Then you will remember this day.

440
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,519
Then you will be glad that you went to Sunday
school.

441
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:51,259
Now, Thomas, tell me and this lady some of
what you have learned in your Bible verses.

442
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,440
We are proud of little boys who learn.

443
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,970
Now, you know the names of the twelve great
followers of Jesus Christ.

444
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,269
Tell us the names of the first two.”

445
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,909
Tom’s face became red and he looked down
at his feet.

446
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:27,279
The teacher knew that Tom could not answer.

447
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:33,320
But he felt that he must speak.

448
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,370
He said: “Answer the gentleman, Thomas.

449
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,519
Do not be afraid.”

450
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:42,869
Tom said nothing.

451
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:46,190
“Surely you will tell me,” said the lady.

452
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,799
“The names of the first two followers of
Jesus Christ were—”

453
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,629
Tom remembered two names from the Bible.

454
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:58,729
He did not remember who the people were, or
what they had done.

455
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:02,419
But the two names were always together.

456
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:03,659
He shouted them now:

457
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,759
“DAVID AND GOLIATH!”

458
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,609
But David and Goliath had not been among the
twelve great followers of Jesus Christ.

459
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:15,649
Their story was in a different part of the
Bible.

460
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:21,720
David was a boy and Goliath was a man of very
great size and strength.

461
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,940
They were enemies.

462
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
And David had killed Goliath.

463
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:33,400
Let us be kind enough to look away from the
rest of this scene of Tom Sawyer in Sunday

464
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
school.

465
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
In Church

466
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,110
The bell of the small church began to ring.

467
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:47,409
The people began to gather to hear Mr. Sprague
speak to them.

468
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:54,570
Mr. Sprague spoke to them in church every
Sunday, and prayed with them.

469
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,690
The Sunday-school children now sat with their
fathers and mothers, who would try to keep

470
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,690
them quiet.

471
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,120
Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary
sat with her.

472
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,549
Tom was placed as far as possible from the
open window and the interesting summer scenes

473
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,549
outside.

474
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,330
Other people came in and went to their seats.

475
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,669
There were the old and poor.

476
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:16,669
There were the middle-aged.

477
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,830
There were the pretty girls in bright summer
clothes, and the young men, with their eyes

478
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,869
following the girls.

479
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,479
There was Mrs. Douglas, whose husband died.

480
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,820
She was rich and good-hearted, and she lived
in the big house on Cardiff Hill.

481
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,109
There was Mufferson, the “Good Boy” of
the village.

482
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:34,580
He came to church with his mother.

483
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,599
All the other mothers talked of his goodness.

484
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,250
All the other boys did not like him.

485
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,309
Now the bell was heard again, and then the
church became very quiet.

486
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:48,989
They were ready to begin.

487
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,669
They began with a song.

488
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:58,279
After the song, Mr. Sprague read a very long
list of meetings to come in the following

489
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,279
week.

490
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,389
Then he prayed.

491
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:05,519
He prayed for many things and for many people.

492
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:12,909
He prayed for the church, and for the little
children of the church, and for the other

493
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:17,409
churches of the village, and for the village,
and then for the whole country, and for the

494
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,450
Government, and then for people of far countries.

495
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:29,760
Tom did not enjoy hearing Mr. Sprague pray,
but he knew he must remain quiet.

496
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:39,590
While Mr. Sprague prayed, a flying bug stopped
on the back of the seat in front of Tom.

497
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,929
It moved its front legs together, one over
the other.

498
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:51,690
It put them around its head, and seemed to
pull until Tom thought that the head would

499
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,090
separate from the body.

500
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,259
It used its back legs to clean its wings.

501
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:03,299
And it did all this slowly, as if knowing
that it was safe.

502
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,559
And indeed it was safe.

503
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,730
Tom did not dare to reach for it.

504
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:21,719
He believed that his soul would be destroyed
suddenly if he did such a thing while Mr.

505
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,049
Sprague was praying.

506
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:30,149
But with the last words, his hand began to
move forward.

507
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:36,989
When the last word came, the bug was in his
hand.

508
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:41,309
But his aunt saw this.

509
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:47,909
She told him to let the bug fly away.

510
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,700
Then Mr. Sprague began a longer talk.

511
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:00,950
He read the words he was saying and Tom counted
the pages as he turned them.

512
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,229
After church, Tom always knew how many pages
there had been.

513
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:09,849
He did not often know what had been said.

514
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,450
But this morning Tom was interested for a
little while.

515
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,909
Mr. Sprague talked about future peace in the
world.

516
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:24,470
The strong and powerful nations, he said,
would be friends of the weak.

517
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,649
The strong, he said, would be like a strong,
wild animal of the forest.

518
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,419
The weak would be like a weak animal of the
farm.

519
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,589
But the strong animal would not hurt the weak
animal.

520
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,499
They would lie down beside each other, in
peace.

521
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:45,779
They would be so gentle and friendly that
a little child could lead them.

522
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,789
Tom wished to be that child.

523
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,469
Then there was no more talk about animals.

524
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,460
Again Tom began to suffer.

525
00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:01,659
He remembered a valuable object that he carried,
and he took it from his pocket.

526
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:05,850
It was a large black bug in a small box.

527
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,769
The bug quickly took a painful hold on Tom’s
finger.

528
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:16,119
The next moment, the bug was on the floor,
on its back, and Tom’s finger was in his

529
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,119
mouth.

530
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:23,539
The bug lay there, moving its legs, but it
could not get on its feet again.

531
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,719
Tom could not reach it.

532
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,899
It was too far away.

533
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,649
But he watched it.

534
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:36,739
Other people, also not interested in Mr. Sprague’s
words, found pleasure in watching the bug.

535
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:39,599
Then a dog entered the church.

536
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,469
He was sad at heart.

537
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:46,360
He wanted some new, different thing to do.

538
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,679
He saw the large black bug, and his tail lifted
and moved a little, happily.

539
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,960
He looked at the bug carefully; walked around
it; put his nose nearer; lay down with the

540
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,489
bug between his front feet; and began to sleep.

541
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:09,249
His head moved down, it touched the bug, and
the bug took a painful hold on his nose.

542
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:14,210
The dog cried loudly, shaking his head.

543
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,269
And the bug fell again on the floor, on its
back.

544
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:22,200
People sitting near were laughing gently,
with their faces covered.

545
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,019
Tom was completely happy.

546
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:34,850
The dog seemed like a fool, and perhaps felt
like a fool.

547
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,870
There was anger in his heart, also.

548
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,760
He went near the bug again and began jumping
at it.

549
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,419
Moving in a circle, he jumped again and again.

550
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,279
Then he had had enough of jumping.

551
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:59,220
He found a smaller bug and followed it for
a while.

552
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,619
Then he had had enough of the smaller bug.

553
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,259
Forgetting the large black bug, he sat down
on it.

554
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:11,080
With a wild cry of pain, he went running around
the church.

555
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,779
The bug kept its hold.

556
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:18,649
The dog ran across the front of the church,
and across the back.

557
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,269
His cries grew louder and louder.

558
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:26,369
Then he jumped into his owner’s arms.

559
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:35,049
His owner threw him out a low window.

560
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:42,850
Then slowly the sound of his voice grew softer
and was gone as he ran quickly away.

561
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:49,119
Now all the people in the church had red faces
and were trying not to laugh.

562
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,849
Mr. Sprague had stopped speaking.

563
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,349
He began again, but it was not easy for him
to continue.

564
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:00,889
Here and there a laugh could be heard.

565
00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:04,739
All were glad when it was time to go home.

566
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,049
Tom Sawyer went home quite happy.

567
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:15,409
Church was a pleasure when something different
happened.

568
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:20,940
There was only one thing that he did not like.

569
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,649
He was glad to let the dog play with his bug.

570
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:29,299
But the dog should not have carried it away.

571
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,690
A Talk of Devils — Happy Hours

572
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,379
The next morning Tom was very sad.

573
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:45,440
This was the beginning of another week of
slow suffering in school.

574
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:55,489
He usually began this day wishing that there
had been no Saturday and no Sunday.

575
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:02,339
Because of them, school seemed more painful
to him.

576
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,749
He lay in bed, thinking.

577
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,289
If he were sick, he could stay home.

578
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:14,179
He thought carefully about all parts of his
body, but he could discover no sickness.

579
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,739
Then he looked at his foot.

580
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,690
His foot had been hurt.

581
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,539
He had an idea.

582
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:23,690
He began to cry as if with pain.

583
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,820
But Sid, in his bed across the room, continued
to sleep.

584
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,629
Tom’s voice grew louder.

585
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:34,159
Now he seemed to feel real pain in his foot.

586
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,969
No result from Sid.

587
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:38,850
Tom said, “Sid, Sid!” and tried shaking
him.

588
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,220
This time the result was good.

589
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,889
When Tom cried again, Sid sat up and looked
at him.

590
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,070
He said, “Tom!

591
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,979
What is wrong?”

592
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:52,919
No answer.

593
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,779
Now Sid tried shaking Tom.

594
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,750
Tom said, “Oh, do not do that, Sid.

595
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,379
It hurts me.”

596
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:05,100
“I must call Aunt Polly.”

597
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
“No.

598
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,820
Do not call her.”

599
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,999
He cried loudly again.

600
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:17,999
Then he said, “I will forget everything
bad that you have done to me, Sid.

601
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,100
When I am dead—”

602
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,720
“Oh, Tom, are you dying?”

603
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,879
“Give my cat with one eye to that new girl,
and tell her—”

604
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:34,359
But Sid was gone.

605
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,110
He ran to his aunt.

606
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,089
“Oh, Aunt Polly!

607
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:41,279
Tom is dying!”

608
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,279
“Dying!

609
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,929
I can’t believe it!”

610
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:46,860
But she ran.

611
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:52,379
Her face was white with fear.

612
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:55,269
At the bedside she cried, “Tom!

613
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,169
Tom, what is wrong?”

614
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,549
“It is my foot, Aunt.

615
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:01,450
Where I hurt it.

616
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,299
The doctor must cut it off.”

617
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:12,559
The old lady sat down in a chair and laughed
a little, then wept a little, then did both

618
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,559
together.

619
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,580
Feeling better, she said, “Tom, you stop
that, and get out of bed.”

620
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,480
Tom stopped crying and the pain stopped, too.

621
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,869
As he walked to school, he met Huckleberry
Finn.

622
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,000
Huckleberry’s father was always drunk.

623
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,829
None of the mothers in the village liked Huckleberry.

624
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:35,750
But all the children liked him.

625
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,579
They wished that they dared to be like him.

626
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,919
Tom also wished that he could be like Huckleberry.

627
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,399
He had been ordered never to play with him.

628
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,770
Therefore, he played with Huckleberry every
time that it was possible.

629
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,619
Huckleberry was always dressed in old clothes.

630
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:59,230
The clothes were always too big for him.

631
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,109
His hat was full of holes.

632
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:08,970
The bottom of his coat touched the ground.

633
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,599
He came and went as he wished.

634
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,660
He did not sleep in a bed; he did not sleep
in a house.

635
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,240
He did not go to school or to church.

636
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,039
He could go swimming or fishing when and where
he might choose.

637
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,920
He was the first boy to wear no shoes in the
early summer.

638
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,400
He was the last boy to wear shoes in the early
winter.

639
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,789
He never washed.

640
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:41,770
He had everything that any boy could desire.

641
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,260
Tom said, “Hello, Huckleberry.”

642
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
“Hello yourself.”

643
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
“What is that?”

644
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,260
“Dead cat.”

645
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,710
“Let me see him, Huck.

646
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,570
Where did you get him?”

647
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,680
“From a boy.”

648
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,910
“Why do you want him, Huck?”

649
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,770
“To take off these warts.”

650
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,440
Huckleberry showed Tom the small spots of
thick, hard skin on his hands.

651
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,839
“I take them off with a bean, Huck.”

652
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:04,839
“Yes.

653
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:06,050
Bean is good.

654
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,250
I have done that.”

655
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,000
“How did you do it?”

656
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,510
“You take the bean and break it in two pieces.

657
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,312
Then you cut the wart and get some blood.

658
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:23,039
Then you put the blood on half the bean.

659
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,789
You make a hole in the ground.

660
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:31,589
You put that half of the bean in the hole,
and cover it with earth.

661
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:38,330
You must do this in the middle of the night
where two roads cross and when the moon is

662
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,330
dark.

663
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,869
Then you burn the other half of the bean.

664
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:49,539
The piece of bean with blood on it will try
to pull the other half to it.

665
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:55,870
And that helps the blood to pull the wart,
and it is gone from your hand.”

666
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,710
“Yes, that is right, Huck.

667
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:03,870
Although when you put the bean in the ground,
you should say, ‘Down, bean; off, wart;

668
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,960
appear no more.’

669
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,950
But how do you take off warts with a dead
cat?”

670
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:17,710
“You wait until the dead body of some bad
person has been put in the ground.

671
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:24,559
Then you take your cat and you go to that
place before the middle of the night.

672
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:30,650
At the middle of the night a devil will come
to carry the dead man away.

673
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,660
Perhaps two or three devils will come.

674
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,740
You can’t see them.

675
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,410
You can only hear a sound like the wind.

676
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,059
Or perhaps you can hear them talk.

677
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,250
And when they take the body away, you throw
the cat after them.

678
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,750
You say, ‘Devil follow body, cat follow
devil, warts follow cat.’

679
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,670
That will take off any wart.”

680
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,260
“Did you ever try it?”

681
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
“Not yet.”

682
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,450
“Huck, when are you going to do it?”

683
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,450
“Tonight.

684
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,589
I think that they will come to get old Hoss
Williams tonight.”

685
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,380
“But they put him in the ground Saturday.

686
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,520
The devils would take him Saturday night.”

687
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,619
“The devils can’t come until twelve.

688
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,740
At twelve on Saturday night, it is Sunday.

689
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,319
Devils can’t come on Sunday.”

690
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,900
“I never thought of that.

691
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,539
Let me go with you?”

692
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:23,200
“If you won’t be afraid.”

693
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
“Afraid!

694
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,099
Will you come to my house and call to me?

695
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,190
Make a noise like a cat.”

696
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,700
“Yes.But you answer Another night I came
to your house,saying, ‘Meow, meow,’ like

697
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
a cat.

698
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
But you never answered.

699
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,270
And your neighbor threw stones at me.”

700
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,000
“Aunt Polly was watching me.

701
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,080
But I will ‘meow’ this time.”

702
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,820
Tom continued walking to school.

703
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,940
He went in quickly, and sat in his seat.

704
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,670
The teacher looked at him.

705
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,670
“Thomas Sawyer!”

706
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,530
Tom knew that trouble was coming when his
whole name was used.

707
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,530
“Why are you late again?”

708
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,380
Tom looked around the room.

709
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,289
He saw the new girl.

710
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,349
No girl sat in the seat beside her.

711
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:02,089
And girls sat in all the other seats on the
girls’ side of the room.

712
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,890
He said, “I stopped to talk with Huckleberry
Finn.”

713
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,910
All the children looked at Tom.

714
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:13,539
It was very foolish to say that to a teacher.

715
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,420
“Thomas Sawyer, I never heard more surprising
words.

716
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,349
Take off your coat.”

717
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:25,039
The teacher had a supply of thin branches
cut from a tree.

718
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:33,549
He used and broke several of these while beating
Tom’s back.

719
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:36,661
Then he ordered, “Go and sit with the girls!”

720
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:39,450
The new girl turned her back toward Tom.

721
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:47,720
Then, after a short time, she turned toward
him, and she saw an apple on the table in

722
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,770
front of her.

723
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,170
She moved it away.

724
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,270
Tom gently moved it toward her.

725
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,180
She moved it away again.

726
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,450
Tom returned it.

727
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,450
Then she let it remain where he had placed
it.

728
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,950
Now Tom began to make a picture on a piece
of paper.

729
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,319
He held one hand over it while he worked and
she could not see it.

730
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,319
She tried to see.

731
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,119
He seemed not to notice her interest.

732
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,980
Then she said, “Let me see.”

733
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,980
He showed her.

734
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
It was a picture of a house.

735
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,790
It was not good, but she thought that it was.

736
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,850
“It is nice.

737
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,270
Now make a man.”

738
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,810
The man was bigger than the house.

739
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,510
“It is beautiful.

740
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,210
Now make me.”

741
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,180
He made a picture of another person.

742
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,349
“That is very nice.

743
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,890
I wish that I could make pictures.”

744
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,059
“I will teach you.

745
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:43,640
At noon.

746
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,430
Do you go home to eat?”

747
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,890
“I will stay if you stay.”

748
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,890
“Good.

749
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,940
What is your name?”

750
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
“Becky Thatcher.

751
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,000
What is yours?

752
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,230
Oh, I know.

753
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,869
It is Thomas Sawyer.”

754
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:00,160
“That is my name when they beat me.

755
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,029
I am Tom when I am good.

756
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,490
You call me Tom, will you?”

757
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,490
“Yes.”

758
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:13,250
Now Tom began writing something, hiding it
with his hand.

759
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,970
She asked to see.

760
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,690
“Oh, it is nothing.

761
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,660
You do not want to see it.”

762
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,910
“Yes, I do.”

763
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,400
“You will tell what it is.”

764
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,799
“I promise never to tell.”

765
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:34,540
“Oh, you do not want to see!”

766
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,220
“I will see.”

767
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:45,390
She put her small hand on his, and then Tom
let her pull the writing away.

768
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:48,410
She read these words: “I love you.”

769
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,390
“Oh, you bad thing!”

770
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,170
And she hit his hand.

771
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,900
But her face showed pleasure.

772
00:41:53,900 --> 00:42:01,480
At this moment the boy felt a hand on his
ear, and a pull lifting him from the seat.

773
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,609
He was returned to his usual seat.

774
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,420
The whole school laughed.

775
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,500
But although Tom’s ear hurt, his heart was
joyful.

776
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,309
An Agreement Is Made

777
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:16,279
At noon Tom ran to Becky and said softly in
her ear:

778
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:21,170
“Start to go home with the others, and then
return here.

779
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,069
I will do the same.”

780
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:24,740
Soon both had returned.

781
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,660
Now they were alone in the school.

782
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,589
They sat together, and Tom put his hand on
Becky’s, guiding it.

783
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:36,380
They made a picture of another house.

784
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Then they talked.

785
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,430
Tom was filled with happiness.

786
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,799
He said, “Becky, were you ever engaged?”

787
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:42,380
“What does that mean?”

788
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,539
“Did you ever promise to marry any boy?”

789
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:46,539
“No.”

790
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,309
“Would you like to be engaged?”

791
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:49,890
“What do you do?”

792
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,680
“You tell a boy that you will marry him.

793
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Then you kiss.

794
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
That is all.

795
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
It is easy.”

796
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,690
“Why do you kiss?”

797
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,640
“They always do that.

798
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,049
Do you remember what I was writing?”

799
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:02,049
“Yes.”

800
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:03,049
“What was it?

801
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:04,049
Shall I tell you?”

802
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,049
“Yes—but not now.

803
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,049
Tomorrow.”

804
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,049
“No.

805
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:08,049
Now.

806
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:09,049
I will say it quietly, Becky.

807
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:10,049
Close to your ear.”

808
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:13,940
He put his arm around her and said the words
quietly.

809
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,759
“Now you tell me.”

810
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,930
She made him turn his face away.

811
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,740
Then she came near.

812
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,819
Her breath moved his hair as she said, “I—love—you!”

813
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:31,490
Then she jumped away from him and ran around
the seats, with Tom running after her.

814
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:39,049
He caught her in a corner, with her hands
over her face.

815
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,930
But her hands dropped.

816
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,890
Tom kissed her and said, “Now it is all
finished, Becky.

817
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:56,529
And always after this you can’t love any
boy except me or marry any boy except me.”

818
00:43:56,529 --> 00:44:00,589
“And you can’t marry any girl but me.”

819
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:01,589
“Certainly.

820
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:04,990
That is part of it.

821
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,750
And we will walk to school together.

822
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,400
Because we are engaged.”

823
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,630
“It is nice.

824
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,109
I never heard of it before.”

825
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,750
“Oh, it is fine.

826
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,320
Me and Amy Lawrence—”

827
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,210
The big eyes told him that he had said the
wrong thing.

828
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,210
“Oh, Tom!

829
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,779
I am not the first that you were engaged to!”

830
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:25,579
She began to weep.

831
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,269
“I do not love her now.

832
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:31,859
I do not love any girl except you.”

833
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:32,859
More weeping.

834
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:36,910
Tom took from his pocket the thing he valued
most.

835
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:41,920
It was a ball-shaped object, of no worth,
but as bright as gold.

836
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,079
“Becky, take this.”

837
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,529
She hit it from his hand to the floor.

838
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:56,390
Then, filled with anger, Tom marched out of
the school and over the hills and far away.

839
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,390
He would return no more that day.

840
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,820
Becky had not really wanted him to go, and
when he did not return within a few moments,

841
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,869
she called, “Tom!

842
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:03,869
Come back!”

843
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:04,970
Then she wept again.

844
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,720
Tom Decides What to Do

845
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,650
Half an hour later Tom was beyond Mrs. Douglas’
house on Cardiff Hill.

846
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:16,269
He entered a thick forest, went to the center
of it, and sat down under a tree.

847
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,799
He was very sad.

848
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,240
He wished that he could die—for a short
time.

849
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,519
But soon he began to think again of living.

850
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,490
He would go far away, to countries across
the sea.

851
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,529
How would Becky feel then?

852
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:34,270
He would be a soldier, and return famous,
after many wars.

853
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:40,450
No, he would join the Indians, and hunt and
fight with them in the Far West.

854
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,720
But no, there was something better.

855
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,480
He would sail across the seas in a long, fast
black ship.

856
00:45:46,480 --> 00:46:00,490
He would follow other ships, take the gold
and silver they carried, then send them to

857
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,079
the bottom of the sea.

858
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,079
That was it!

859
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,269
He would be a pirate, famous in the whole
world.

860
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,450
Tom Sawyer the Pirate!

861
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,820
Yes, it was decided.

862
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,789
He would start his journey the next morning.

863
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:20,240
At this moment he heard a call from far away
in the forest.

864
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:27,140
He went to a place, very near, where he kept
some of his things.

865
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,549
From this place he took a long knife made
of wood.

866
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:35,390
He tied it to his side.

867
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,940
He was not Tom Sawyer now.

868
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:45,609
He dreamed he had become a famous leader named
Robin Hood who had lived with his men hundreds

869
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:48,170
of years before, in another forest.

870
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:52,970
He advanced slowly, moving carefully from
behind one tree to another.

871
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,470
Believing for the moment that he really was
Robin Hood, he said:

872
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,470
“Stay where you are, my men.

873
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,630
Do not move until I call.”

874
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:02,500
Now Joe Harper appeared.

875
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,470
He, too, had a long wooden knife.

876
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,849
Tom called, “Stop!

877
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:09,609
Who comes here into Sherwood Forest?

878
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:14,670
No person enters my forest until I say that
he may!”

879
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,730
“I am Guy of Guisborne,” said Joe Harper,
continuing the game.

880
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,019
“I go where I wish.

881
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:23,400
Who are you?”

882
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,400
“I!

883
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,749
I am Robin Hood, as you shall soon know when
you lie dead there on the ground.”

884
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,430
“Are you indeed that famous man?

885
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,109
Gladly will I fight with you.”

886
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:43,140
They took their two long knives, and began
a slow, careful fight.Then Tom said, “Now

887
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,140
fight faster.”

888
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,749
They were soon hot from their efforts.

889
00:47:46,749 --> 00:47:47,749
“Fall!”

890
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:48,749
Tom said.

891
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:49,749
“You must fall!”

892
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:50,749
“You fall!

893
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:52,369
I am fighting better than you.”

894
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:57,720
“But the story of Robin Hood says that I
kill you.

895
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:04,299
Turn and let me hit you in the back.”

896
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:08,619
Joe turned, received the blow, and fell.

897
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,579
“Now,” Joe said, rising, “you must let
me kill you.”

898
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,170
“I can’t do that.

899
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,529
It is not in the story.”

900
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:18,589
“It should be.”

901
00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:23,920
“Joe, you can be Robin Hood for a while.

902
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,510
I will be Robin’s enemy, and you can kill
me.”

903
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,020
This was agreeable, and more fighting followed.

904
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,960
Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and he was
hurt, and all his blood ran from his body.

905
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,499
And Joe, who had now become all of Robin Hood’s
men, watched with tears in his eyes as Robin

906
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:43,499
Hood died.

907
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:45,369
Then the boys went home.

908
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,890
They were sad because Robin Hood had lived
so long ago.

909
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,849
They would have liked living with him in Sherwood
Forest better than being President of the

910
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,849
United States.

911
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,849
Indian Joe Explains

912
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,299
At nine that night Tom and Sid were sent to
bed as usual.

913
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:04,410
They prayed, and Sid was soon asleep.

914
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,420
Tom was waiting.

915
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,770
Time passed very slowly.

916
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,130
Little noises came out of the darkness.

917
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:19,490
The cry of a far off dog was heard in the
night air, and was answered by another dog.

918
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,970
By that time Tom was asleep.

919
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,740
Then there came, among his dreams, the call
of a cat.

920
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,900
A neighbor opened a window.

921
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,590
Tom heard this, and a minute later he was
through his window.

922
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,369
He “meowed” as he went.

923
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,440
Then he jumped.

924
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,560
Huckleberry Finn was there with his dead cat.

925
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,560
In half an hour the boys were in the graveyard.

926
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,329
The graveyard was on a hill, a mile and a
half from the village.

927
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:39,910
There was an old board fence around it.

928
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,680
A light wind sounded in the trees, and Tom
was afraid that the sound came from the spirits

929
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,950
of the dead.

930
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,650
The boys talked little.

931
00:49:46,650 --> 00:50:00,259
The time and the place and the quiet were
heavy on their hearts.

932
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:06,760
They found the new grave and sat down under
the branches of three big trees near it.

933
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,530
They waited a long time.

934
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,779
After a while, Tom felt that he must talk.

935
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:19,190
“Huck, do you believe that the dead people
are pleased to have us here?”

936
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,299
“I wish I knew.”

937
00:50:21,299 --> 00:50:26,059
“Huck, do you think Hoss Williams hears
us talking?”

938
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:28,180
“His spirit hears us.”

939
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,880
“I wish I had said Mr. Williams.

940
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,049
But all the people said Hoss.”

941
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:41,599
“You must be careful how you talk about
dead people, Tom.”

942
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,480
There was no more talk for a while.

943
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,859
Then Tom touched Huck’s arm.

944
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:49,140
“Did you hear it?

945
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,720
There it is again!

946
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,519
Now you hear it.”

947
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,349
The two held each other with fast-beating
hearts.

948
00:50:58,349 --> 00:50:59,910
“Tom, they are coming!

949
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,480
What shall we do?”

950
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,049
“I do not know.

951
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:04,609
Will they see us?”

952
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:08,140
“Tom, they can see in the dark, like cats.

953
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,339
I wish I had not come.”

954
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:12,249
“Oh, do not be afraid.

955
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:13,779
We are doing nothing.

956
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:17,589
If we are completely quiet, perhaps they won’t
see us.”

957
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:19,119
“I will try, Tom.

958
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,650
But I am shaking.”

959
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:21,650
“Listen!”

960
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,710
The sound of voices came from the far end
of the graveyard.

961
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,710
“Look!

962
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,980
See there!” said Tom.

963
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,940
“What is it?”

964
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,880
“It is devil-fire.

965
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,390
Oh, Tom, this is very bad.”

966
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,329
Some dark shapes came near, carrying a light.

967
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:42,049
Huckleberry said, shaking more, “It is the
devils.

968
00:51:42,049 --> 00:51:43,440
Three of them.

969
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,220
Tom, we are in great trouble.

970
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,609
Can you pray?”

971
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:48,999
“I will try.”

972
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:50,849
Tom began to pray.

973
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:51,849
“Tom!

974
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:52,849
They are human!

975
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:54,999
That is old Muff Potter’s voice.

976
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:56,980
He is drunk, as usual.

977
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,569
He won’t see us.”

978
00:51:58,569 --> 00:52:00,559
“Huck, I know another voice.

979
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,559
It is Indian Joe.”

980
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,559
“Devils would be better than that half-Indian.

981
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,559
What do they want here?”

982
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:10,400
Then the boys were quiet, because the three
men had arrived at the new grave.

983
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,270
“Here it is,” said the third voice.

984
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:16,750
In the light the boys saw the face of young
Doctor Robinson.

985
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,799
He was so near that the boys could have touched
him.

986
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:22,369
“Hurry, men!” he said.

987
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:24,990
“The moon may appear from behind the clouds.”

988
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,920
The other two men began opening the grave.

989
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,920
For a while no sound was heard except the
sound of their work.

990
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,540
Then they came to the box which contained
the body.

991
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,760
They opened it and lifted the body out of
the box.

992
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,390
The moon appeared and the dead man’s face
could be seen.

993
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,050
Potter held up a knife.

994
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,559
“Now, Doctor, the thing is ready.

995
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:56,869
And here it stays unless you pay us five dollars
more.”

996
00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:00,329
“You have your money,” the doctor said.

997
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:05,430
“You and your father once sent me to jail,”
Indian Joe said.

998
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,700
“Five years ago.

999
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,509
Do you think I would forget?

1000
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:12,420
Now you pay!”

1001
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,250
The doctor hit him suddenly, and Indian Joe
fell.

1002
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:17,480
Potter dropped his knife.

1003
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,039
“You hit my friend!” he said.

1004
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,400
He jumped at the doctor and the two began
fighting.

1005
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,339
Now Indian Joe was on his feet again.

1006
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:36,190
He picked up Potter’s knife, and began moving
like a cat, around and around the fighters.

1007
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,119
He was watching for a chance to strike the
doctor.

1008
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:42,440
Suddenly the doctor was free.

1009
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,109
He picked up a board and used it to strike
Potter, who fell quickly to the ground.

1010
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:49,279
At the same moment Indian Joe saw his chance.

1011
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:55,319
The whole length of his knife went into the
doctor’s body.

1012
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:59,829
The doctor fell, partly on Potter, covering
Potter with his blood.

1013
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:02,930
Clouds covered the moon, and the two boys
ran into the darkness.

1014
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:10,990
When the moon appeared again, Indian Joe was
looking down at the two men lying on the ground.

1015
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,730
The doctor made some sounds that were not
possible to understand, and then, after a

1016
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:15,210
long breath, he was quiet.

1017
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,799
The Indian said, “Now that is finished!”

1018
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:21,780
He put the knife in Potter’s right hand.

1019
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,009
Then he sat down and waited.

1020
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:25,900
Soon Potter began to move.

1021
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,150
His hand closed on the knife.

1022
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,180
He looked at it and let it fall.

1023
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,569
Then he sat up and looked at the doctor’s
body.

1024
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:35,700
“What happened, Joe?” he said.

1025
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,680
“It is a bad business,” said Joe.

1026
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,809
“Why did you do it?”

1027
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:41,809
“I!

1028
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:42,930
I never did it!”

1029
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,210
Potter was shaking.

1030
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,489
“I was drunk.

1031
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:48,039
I do not remember what happened.

1032
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,170
Did I do it, Joe?

1033
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,730
I never wanted to do it.”

1034
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,799
“He hit you and then you did it.

1035
00:54:55,799 --> 00:54:59,319
But you have always been good to me, Muff
Potter.

1036
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:00,319
I won’t tell.”

1037
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,380
“Oh, Joe, I will bless you for that as long
as I live.”

1038
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,480
And Potter began to weep.

1039
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,060
“This is no time for weeping.

1040
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:11,869
You go that way and I will go this way.

1041
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:12,869
Move, now.”

1042
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,150
Potter started running.

1043
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,970
Joe stood watching him.

1044
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,619
“He forgets his knife because he is drunk.

1045
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,923
When he remembers, he will be afraid to return
for it.”

1046
00:55:22,923 --> 00:55:28,009
Two or three minutes later the dead doctor,
the body from the grave, the opened box, were

1047
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:29,839
alone under the moon.

1048
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,239
The quiet was complete again.

1049
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:32,239
The Promise — The Result of Fear

1050
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:33,980
The two boys ran toward the village.

1051
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:38,400
They looked behind them often, afraid that
they were being followed.

1052
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:45,319
After a while, they came to the edge of the
village.

1053
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:47,369
There stood an old building which was not
used.

1054
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:52,180
They ran through the open door and fell to
the ground.

1055
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,680
“Huckleberry, what do you think will happen
now?”

1056
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,920
“If the doctor dies, they will hang Indian
Joe.”

1057
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,160
Tom spoke.

1058
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,910
“Who will tell about it?

1059
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,760
You and I?”

1060
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:15,019
“If we did, and if Indian Joe did not hang,
he would kill us.”

1061
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:17,849
“I was thinking that, Huck.”

1062
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:22,799
“Let Muff Potter tell if he is fool enough.

1063
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,839
He is usually drunk enough.”

1064
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,839
Tom continued to think.

1065
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:30,009
Then he said, “Huck, Muff Potter does not
know what happened.

1066
00:56:30,009 --> 00:56:34,059
The doctor had hit him with that board.

1067
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:38,109
Huck, are you sure that you won’t tell?”

1068
00:56:38,109 --> 00:56:40,140
“Tom, we can’t tell.

1069
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,660
You know that.

1070
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:47,410
Indian Joe would drown us like two cats if
we told.

1071
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,339
Tom, we must promise never to tell.

1072
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:55,349
It must be a strong promise.

1073
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:56,690
With writing.

1074
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,690
And blood.”

1075
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,940
Tom agreed with all his heart.

1076
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,130
This idea was what must be done.

1077
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:15,039
It was deep and dark and fearful.

1078
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:24,430
This was the hour and the place to do it.

1079
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:29,589
He found a clean broad piece of wood.

1080
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:32,329
In his pocket he found something to write
with.

1081
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:33,800
The moon was his light.

1082
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,280
Painfully he formed the words:

1083
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:43,019
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer promise they will
never tell about this, and they wish they

1084
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:46,910
may die in their footsteps if they ever tell.

1085
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:51,240
Then each boy cut a finger and signed in blood
TS and HF.

1086
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,970
Tom helped Huck to write his H and F.

1087
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:59,089
Then they made a hole in the ground near the
wall of the building.

1088
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:03,450
They placed the piece of wood in the hole
and covered it with earth.

1089
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,450
Now they were certain.

1090
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,819
Their mouths would never speak about what
their eyes had seen.

1091
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:08,760
When Tom entered his house through his bedroom
window, the night was almost gone.

1092
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,521
He took off his clothes very quietly and lay
down.

1093
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:14,740
He believed, happily, that his aunt would
never know that he had been away.

1094
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,560
But Sid was not asleep.

1095
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,749
The next morning his aunt gave him some food.

1096
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:25,760
Then she wept, and she asked him why he hurt
her old heart.

1097
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,150
She wished to help him to be good.

1098
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:31,720
She tried and tried, but she could try no
more.

1099
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,750
A thousand beatings would have been easier
for Tom.

1100
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,730
He wept.

1101
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,869
He promised to be good.

1102
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:44,430
But he felt that she did not believe his promises.

1103
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:50,829
He went to school, and there the teacher beat
him and Joe Harper, because they had run away

1104
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:53,390
from school the day before.

1105
00:58:53,390 --> 00:59:00,640
Then he went to his seat.

1106
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,440
A hard object, covered in paper, was waiting
for him there.

1107
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,579
He opened the paper.

1108
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:20,160
Inside was the bright, shining ball that looked
like gold that he had given to Becky Thatcher.

1109
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,390
This was too much.

1110
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,460
Now his heart was broken.

1111
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,700
Tom’s Troubled Mind

1112
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,839
At noon the whole village suddenly knew the
fearful news.

1113
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:37,480
The story traveled quickly from man to man,
group to group, house to house.

1114
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,180
The schoolteacher closed the school.

1115
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,880
The knife had been found.

1116
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,809
It was known to be Potter’s knife.

1117
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:51,350
And Potter had been seen washing himself in
a small stream, in the very early morning.

1118
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,560
When seen, he had run away.

1119
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,619
All this was very strange, especially because
Potter almost never washed.

1120
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:02,430
All the people in the town were slowly going
toward the graveyard.

1121
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,619
Tom joined them.

1122
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:08,380
He did not wish to go, but something seemed
to force him.

1123
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:13,680
He arrived at the fearful place, and saw the
scene again.

1124
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,680
It seemed a hundred years since he had seen
it before.

1125
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,900
A hand touched his arm.

1126
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,900
He turned.

1127
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,569
His eyes met Huckleberry’s.

1128
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:24,900
Both looked away.

1129
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,680
Were they being watched?

1130
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,109
Now Tom began to shake, because he saw Indian
Joe.

1131
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:31,460
Then Muff Potter appeared.

1132
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,160
A few people saw him.

1133
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
They shouted.

1134
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,720
The crowd separated and Potter walked through.

1135
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,339
A village law officer was holding his arm.

1136
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:45,190
Potter’s eyes showed his fear.

1137
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:54,730
When he stood beside the dead doctor, he put
his face in his hands and began to weep.

1138
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,890
“I did not do it, friends,” he said.

1139
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,869
“I did not do it.”

1140
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:01,839
“Who said that you did?”

1141
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,029
a voice shouted.

1142
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:06,579
Potter lifted his face and looked around without
hope.

1143
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:13,160
He saw Indian Joe, and said, “Oh, Indian
Joe, you promised me that you would never—”

1144
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,059
“Is this your knife?”

1145
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:19,829
It was held by the law officer for him to
see.

1146
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:21,190
Potter began to fall.

1147
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:25,869
Men caught him and let him go slowly down
to the ground.

1148
01:01:25,869 --> 01:01:32,309
Then he said, “I thought that I should come
and get—” He stopped, shaking.

1149
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:34,980
Then he said, “Tell them, Joe.

1150
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:35,980
Tell them.”

1151
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,079
Indian Joe told his story.

1152
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,589
Huckleberry and Tom stood, not able to speak,
and with eyes wide with fear.

1153
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:53,309
They expected the skies to open with a sudden
storm, to strike down Indian Joe.

1154
01:01:53,309 --> 01:02:02,619
But he finished his story and stood there,
living and whole.

1155
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:07,980
They wished to tell the truth, but they did
not dare.

1156
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:12,890
During a week after this, Tom could not sleep
well.

1157
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:19,970
One morning Sid said, “Tom, you talk in
your sleep so much that I can’t sleep half

1158
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:20,970
the night.”

1159
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,089
Tom’s face became white and he looked away.

1160
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,030
“This is bad,” said Aunt Polly.

1161
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,290
“There is something in your mind, Tom.

1162
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,290
What is it?”

1163
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,290
“Nothing.”

1164
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,290
But Tom’s hand was shaking.

1165
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,140
He could not lift his cup.

1166
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,750
“And you say fearful things!”

1167
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,750
Sid said.

1168
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,220
“Last night you said, ‘It is blood, it
is blood!’

1169
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,590
You said that again and again.

1170
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:42,630
Then you said, ‘Do not hurt me.

1171
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,630
I will tell!’

1172
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,630
Tell what?”

1173
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,630
Aunt Polly said, “I understand.

1174
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,630
It is that killing.

1175
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,630
I dream about it also.”

1176
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,630
Mary said that she also dreamed about it,
and then Sid stopped talking.

1177
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,940
Slowly Tom’s mind grew quieter and his sleep
was easier.

1178
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:57,229
Almost every day, during this bad time, Tom
went to the jail window and gave Potter some

1179
01:02:57,229 --> 01:02:58,229
small gift.

1180
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:00,079
Then he felt happier.

1181
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,220
The village people wanted to put Indian Joe
in jail also.

1182
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,170
Like Muff Potter, he had been helping the
doctor to carry away that dead body from its

1183
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,170
grave.

1184
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:10,170
But the people did nothing.

1185
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,000
All were afraid of Indian Joe.

1186
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,270
Tom Shows His Kindness

1187
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,869
Tom had a new and great trouble.

1188
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:18,210
Becky Thatcher was ill.

1189
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,579
He was afraid that she might die.

1190
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:24,920
The joy of life was gone.

1191
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,410
He played no games.

1192
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:29,089
He was not interested in anything.

1193
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:32,369
His aunt did not know what was wrong.

1194
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:35,550
She tried to find some help for him.

1195
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,650
She was always reading about health.

1196
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:44,420
She read about how to go to bed, and how to
get up from bed, what to eat, and what to

1197
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:48,759
drink, and what clothes to wear for good health,
and how to think for good health.

1198
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,599
She believed all that she read.

1199
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:54,359
When she read something new, she wanted to
try it.

1200
01:03:54,359 --> 01:04:00,720
She took Tom outside in the early morning
and poured cold water over him.

1201
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:09,380
Then she covered him with a wet cloth and
put him to bed, with heavy covers over him.

1202
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:15,059
When he was so hot that water formed on his
skin, she was happy.

1203
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,900
She thought that this would help him.

1204
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,200
But Tom became sadder and sadder.

1205
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,829
She tried pouring hot water over him instead
of cold.

1206
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:26,680
She tried less food.

1207
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,180
Soon Tom stopped fighting against what she
did.

1208
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:33,339
And then she was sure that he was very ill
indeed.

1209
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:36,539
Next, she heard of something new named Painkiller.

1210
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,549
She put some in her own mouth, to taste it.

1211
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:42,319
It was like a mouthful of fire.

1212
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,779
She gave some to Tom and watched him.

1213
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:44,920
This Painkiller had a strong result.

1214
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,670
The boy was wildly interested.

1215
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,950
He acted as if she had built a fire under
him.

1216
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:53,259
She knew that she had found the right thing.

1217
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:57,700
And Tom knew that it was time for him to act.

1218
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,599
He thought of several plans.

1219
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,640
He decided to say that he liked Painkiller.

1220
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:10,549
He asked for it so often that his aunt gave
the whole container to him.

1221
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:16,549
Now he could have Painkiller at any time.

1222
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:22,799
She did not know that everyday he put some
in a hole in the floor.

1223
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:30,710
One day as he was doing this, the cat came
in and seemed to want some of the Painkiller.

1224
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,760
“You do not want it, Peter.”

1225
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:38,290
But Peter continued to seem to ask for it.

1226
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,040
“Are you sure?”

1227
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,790
Peter was sure.

1228
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:48,160
“You have asked for it, and I will give
it to you.

1229
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,359
I am a kind boy.

1230
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:55,180
But if you do not like it, remember that you
asked.”

1231
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,569
He opened the cat’s mouth and put in some
Painkiller.

1232
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:04,400
Peter jumped high into the air and cried a
wild cry.

1233
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,869
Then he started going around and around the
room, running against chairs and tables.

1234
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:13,420
Next he stood on his back feet and danced,
with cries of joy.

1235
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:17,480
Then he went faster around the room again.

1236
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,999
Aunt Polly arrived.

1237
01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:26,210
He rolled over and over, gave one last great
cry, and jumped through the open window.

1238
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,730
Tom was on the floor, weak from laughing.

1239
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:33,099
“Tom, what is wrong with the cat?”

1240
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:36,420
“Cats always do that to show their joy.”

1241
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,279
But Aunt Polly saw the Painkiller.

1242
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:39,309
She knew what had happened.

1243
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:45,479
She caught Tom’s ear and pulled him up,
then hit him with her hand.

1244
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:48,369
“Why did you do that to the cat?”

1245
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:53,640
“Because I am sorry that he has no aunt
to care for him.”

1246
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,130
“Has no aunt!

1247
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,609
Why do you say that?”

1248
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:06,180
“Because if he had an aunt she would give
him a drink that burned his mouth and not

1249
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,180
think of his feelings.

1250
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:13,210
She would say, if the drink was good for a
human, it would be good for a cat.”

1251
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:14,310
Aunt Polly thought.

1252
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:18,339
If it hurt a cat, it might hurt a boy, also.

1253
01:07:18,339 --> 01:07:20,910
She put her hand on Tom’s head.

1254
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:22,070
“I was trying to help you.”

1255
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,750
“And I was trying to help Peter.

1256
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,950
And it helped him.

1257
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,059
I never saw him move so fast.”

1258
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:28,859
He was smiling at her now.

1259
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:29,859
“Oh, Tom!

1260
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,869
I will not give you any more Painkiller.

1261
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:32,869
Go to school.

1262
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:35,089
And try to be a good boy.”

1263
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:36,859
Tom was early at school.

1264
01:07:36,859 --> 01:07:38,579
He was often early now.

1265
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:42,900
Today, as he often did, he waited at the gate.

1266
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,400
He did not play.

1267
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,479
He was sick, he said.

1268
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,140
And he seemed sick.

1269
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:55,099
Jeff Thatcher came down the road, and Tom’s
face was brighter.

1270
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:59,160
But quickly it was dark again.

1271
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Jeff was alone.

1272
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:07,720
When Tom saw a girl’s dress far away, he
watched and watched.

1273
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,920
But the girl was never the right one.

1274
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,650
He entered the school and sat down to suffer.

1275
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:19,040
Then one more dress came through the gate.

1276
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,040
Tom’s heart jumped.

1277
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:26,500
The next moment he was outside again, shouting,
laughing, running after other boys, jumping

1278
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,199
over the fence, standing on his head.

1279
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:33,880
He was doing all this to make Becky Thatcher
watch him.

1280
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,010
She never looked at him.

1281
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:39,230
Was it possible that she did not see him?

1282
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,580
He came running and shouting.

1283
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,339
He threw a boy’s hat over the schoolhouse.

1284
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:52,940
He ran through a group of boys, and then he
fell at her feet.

1285
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:59,710
She turned away with her nose raised high
in the air.

1286
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:05,589
“Some people always want other people to
look at them!”

1287
01:09:05,589 --> 01:09:07,299
His face became red.

1288
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:10,369
He stood straight and walked quietly away.

1289
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:12,000
The Young Pirates

1290
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,170
Tom had decided now.

1291
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:16,710
He was sad and without hope.

1292
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,210
He was a boy with no friends.

1293
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,639
No person loved him.

1294
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:28,940
He had tried to do what was right, but they
would not let him.

1295
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:32,130
Yes, they were forcing him into a bad life.

1296
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:34,259
He could now choose nothing else.

1297
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:36,739
He had come far from the village.

1298
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:44,099
He heard the distant school bell, and he knew
that he would never, never hear it again.

1299
01:09:44,099 --> 01:09:46,679
Tears fell from his eyes.

1300
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:50,799
Here he met his best friend, Joe Harper.

1301
01:09:50,799 --> 01:10:03,670
Joe’s eyes were filled with anger, and it
was easy to see that there was a great and

1302
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:10,130
sad purpose in his heart.

1303
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:19,429
Tom said that he was going to travel around
the world, never to return to the village.

1304
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:22,110
He hoped that Joe would not forget him.

1305
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:25,150
And Joe had come to say the same to Tom.

1306
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:28,540
They were two souls with only one thought.

1307
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,660
Joe’s mother had beaten him.

1308
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,420
But he had done nothing.

1309
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,340
She plainly wished him to go away.

1310
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,010
Therefore, he was going.

1311
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:40,349
He hoped that she would be happy now.

1312
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:47,530
He hoped that she would never be sorry about
sending her boy into the cold world to suffer

1313
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:48,530
and die.

1314
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,080
The two boys walked together.

1315
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,270
They agreed to be like brothers.

1316
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,820
They would never separate until they died.

1317
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,880
They began to plan.

1318
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,130
They decided to be pirates.

1319
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,960
Three miles south of the village, there was
an island in the river.

1320
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,470
The Mississippi River was a mile wide there.

1321
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:07,730
The island was long and not very wide, and
it was covered with trees.

1322
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:17,920
No people lived on it, and few people lived
on the river’s shore near the island.

1323
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,020
It would be a good place for pirates.

1324
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,710
Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined
them.

1325
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,170
They talked, and then they separated.

1326
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:32,480
They would meet again beside the river two
miles north of the village at twelve that

1327
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,480
night.

1328
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,139
Tom knew where they would find a small boat.

1329
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:37,610
They would take it.

1330
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:41,640
Each boy would bring food and other useful
things, if possible.

1331
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,929
Tom arrived with meat and a few other things.

1332
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:49,280
He stopped among the trees on a hill above
the meeting place.

1333
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,780
There were many stars, and it was very quiet.

1334
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,320
The great river lay like an ocean at rest.

1335
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,770
Tom listened a moment, but the quiet was broken
by no sound.

1336
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,369
Then he whistled gently.

1337
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:08,510
The whistle was answered from below.

1338
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:11,699
Tom whistled two more times and was answered
again.

1339
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,290
Then a voice said:

1340
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,489
“Who goes there?”

1341
01:12:14,489 --> 01:12:16,389
“Tom Sawyer the Black Pirate.

1342
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:17,889
Name your names.”

1343
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:22,510
“Huck Finn the Red-Handed and Joe Harper
the Destroyer of the Seas.”

1344
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:25,820
Tom had taken these names from his best-loved
books.

1345
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:26,820
“Speak the word.”

1346
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,820
Two voices spoke together: “BLOOD!”

1347
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:29,949
Tom went down the hill to join them.

1348
01:12:29,949 --> 01:12:35,449
The Destroyer of the Seas had also brought
meat, and Finn the Red-Handed had some tobacco.

1349
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:40,170
The Black Pirate said that they must also
have fire.

1350
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:46,400
They went to a large riverboat that was near,
and they took some of the fire burning there.

1351
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:52,180
They knew that there were no men on the boat.

1352
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:57,400
The boatmen were all in the village.

1353
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,790
But the boys moved very quietly and carefully.

1354
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,070
Pirates must be pirates.

1355
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:07,949
With Tom as captain of their ship, they left
the shore and went into the middle of the

1356
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:08,949
river.

1357
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:12,290
From here they let the moving river carry
them along.

1358
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:14,260
They passed the distant village.

1359
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,840
Two or three lights showed where it was, peacefully
sleeping.

1360
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:26,100
The Black Pirate stood in the boat looking
for the last time at the scene of his early

1361
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,100
joys and later sufferings.

1362
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:32,590
He wished that his aunt could see him now,
facing the fearful future with a smile on

1363
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,590
his lips.

1364
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:35,969
After two hours their boat touched the island.

1365
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:38,739
There was an old sail in the boat.

1366
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:41,610
They spread this over their supplies, under
the trees.

1367
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:46,500
They would sleep in the open air, as pirates
should.

1368
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,760
They built a fire and cooked some meat.

1369
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:58,739
It seemed wonderful to be eating in that wild,
free manner in the forest, far from other

1370
01:13:58,739 --> 01:13:59,739
people.

1371
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:03,810
They said that they would never return to
a village or town again.

1372
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:08,139
After eating, they lay on the ground, talking.

1373
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:13,980
The fire lighted their faces and the trees
near them with a red light.

1374
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,389
Huck prepared to smoke some of his tobacco.

1375
01:14:16,389 --> 01:14:20,920
Soon he was blowing out a cloud of smoke,
and the other pirates were wishing that they

1376
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,830
could do the same.

1377
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:28,199
Huck said, “What do pirates do?”

1378
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,530
Tom said, “Oh, they enjoy life.

1379
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:34,280
They follow other ships and catch them and
burn them.

1380
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:41,780
They take the money from those ships and put
it in a deep hole in the ground on their island.

1381
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:46,010
And they kill the people on the ships.”

1382
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:50,620
“They carry the women to the island,”
said Joe.

1383
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,860
“They do not kill the women.”

1384
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,480
“No,” Tom agreed.

1385
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,110
“Pirates are good.

1386
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,770
They do not kill the women.

1387
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,000
And the women are always beautiful.”

1388
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,080
“And their clothes are covered with gold
and silver,” said Joe.

1389
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,570
“Whose clothes?” said Huck.

1390
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,570
“The pirates’.”

1391
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,540
Huck looked down at his clothes.

1392
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:13,260
“I am not dressed right for a pirate,”
he said.

1393
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,489
“But these are my only clothes.”

1394
01:15:15,489 --> 01:15:22,510
The other boys told him that the fine clothes
would come later, when they began their adventures.

1395
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:23,760
Slowly their talk ended.

1396
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,770
The Red-Handed went to sleep quickly.

1397
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:29,160
The Destroyer of the Seas and the Black Pirate
could not sleep so quickly.

1398
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,980
They began now to have some doubt.

1399
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:37,850
Had it been wrong to run away from home?

1400
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:42,190
Had it been wrong to take the meat?

1401
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,750
The meat did not belong to them.

1402
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:51,630
They decided that they would never again take
what did not belong to them.

1403
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,020
And with that decided, these pirates also
were peacefully asleep.

1404
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,040
Island Life — Tom Quietly Leaves

1405
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,800
Opening his eyes, Tom wondered where he was.

1406
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,300
He sat up and looked around.

1407
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Then he remembered.

1408
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,770
It was cool and the light was the gray color
of early morning.

1409
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:13,599
There was a delightful feeling of rest and
peace in the deep quiet of the forest.

1410
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:17,389
A thin blue breath of smoke rose from the
fire.

1411
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:19,659
Joe and Huck were yet asleep.

1412
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,929
Now, far away, a bird called.

1413
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:22,929
Another answered.

1414
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:25,260
Slowly the cool gray of the morning changed
to white.

1415
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,260
More sounds were heard.

1416
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:32,780
The life of the forest began to show itself
to the watching boy.

1417
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:36,150
Bugs appeared and started their day’s labors.

1418
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:39,040
Birds were making many noises now.

1419
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,380
A big blue bird stopped very near to Tom.

1420
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:49,030
It turned its head to one side, and sat watching
its strange new neighbors.

1421
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:58,000
Small animals appeared and they also looked
at the boys and seemed to be talking to them.

1422
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,159
Perhaps they had never seen a human being
before.

1423
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:05,020
Perhaps they did not know whether or not to
be afraid.

1424
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,720
Tom called to the other pirates.

1425
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,679
Within a few moments they were all playing
in the river near the shore.

1426
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:18,810
Their boat had been carried away, but this
pleased them.

1427
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:23,800
They were certain now that they would never
return to their village.

1428
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,940
Happy and hungry, they built their fire.

1429
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:32,130
Huck had found some good water to drink.

1430
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:41,369
While Joe cooked some meat, Tom and Huck went
to the river and caught some fish.

1431
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,450
Joe cooked these with the meat.

1432
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,670
No fish had ever tasted so good.

1433
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,670
Then Huck smoked.

1434
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:52,840
After that, they all started to walk through
the trees to see what they could discover.

1435
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,080
They found much to delight them, but nothing
surprising.

1436
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:03,460
The island was almost three miles long and
a quarter of a mile wide.

1437
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:09,920
It was very near to the shore on one side,
but far from the shore where their village

1438
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,920
was.

1439
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,580
They played in the river often.

1440
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:17,500
It was the middle of the afternoon before
they returned to their fire.

1441
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:22,139
They ate some meat again and then they sat
in the shade to talk.

1442
01:18:22,139 --> 01:18:24,110
But the talk soon stopped.

1443
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:28,890
The quiet, the loneliness, were beginning
to change their happiness.

1444
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,900
They began to be sad.

1445
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,080
Tom and Joe were thinking of home.

1446
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,280
Finn the Red-Handed, who had no home, was
thinking of the places where he usually went

1447
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,280
to sleep.

1448
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,159
But they did not speak to each other of this
weakness.

1449
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,310
Now they heard a distant sound.

1450
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:44,730
They looked at each other, and listened.

1451
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:49,000
There was a long quiet, and then the sound—Boom!

1452
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,679
Then a long, long quiet, and then again, Boom!

1453
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,120
“We must go and see.”

1454
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,100
They jumped up and ran to the shore nearer
the town.

1455
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,949
The trees there were small, and grew thickly.

1456
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:06,170
Through them, the boys looked across the water.

1457
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:08,170
They saw a big riverboat.

1458
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:12,310
It was the boat that crossed the river many
times every day.

1459
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:15,840
Now it was coming slowly down the river.

1460
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,250
It was crowded with people.

1461
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:21,630
There were many small boats around it.

1462
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:28,380
Then from the riverboat came a cloud of white
smoke, and then another Boom!

1463
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,800
“I understand now!” said Tom.

1464
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,730
“Some person is drowned!”

1465
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:35,000
“That is right,” said Huck.

1466
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,090
“They did that last summer when Bill Turner
was drowned.

1467
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,969
A big gun makes that Boom!

1468
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:46,070
And then the body rises to the top of the
water.”

1469
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:49,230
“I wish that I was on that riverboat now,”
said Joe.

1470
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,660
“I wonder who is drowned,” said Huck.

1471
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,150
They continued to listen and watch.

1472
01:19:55,150 --> 01:20:00,639
Then a thought came into Tom’s mind like
a sudden light.

1473
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:07,040
“Boys, I know who is drowned.

1474
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:12,380
They are looking for us!”

1475
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,719
This was a wonderful thing to know.

1476
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,170
Hearts were breaking for them.

1477
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:19,170
Tears were falling.

1478
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,139
People were sorry that they had not always
been kind to them.

1479
01:20:22,139 --> 01:20:25,150
The whole town was talking about them.

1480
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:26,480
This was fine.

1481
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,570
It was good to be a pirate.

1482
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,230
All doubt of that was gone.

1483
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:36,650
As darkness came, the riverboat returned to
her usual business.

1484
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:39,310
The pirates returned to their fire.

1485
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:44,810
They were joyful that they were so important
and were causing so much sadness.

1486
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,159
They caught more fish to eat.

1487
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:51,860
Then they talked about what the village people
were thinking and saying.

1488
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:57,780
But as the night grew darker, they stopped
talking and sat looking into the fire.

1489
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:03,310
Tom and Joe thought of persons at home who
were not enjoying all of this.

1490
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,889
Joe began to speak of returning to the village.

1491
01:21:05,889 --> 01:21:07,349
Tom laughed at him.

1492
01:21:07,349 --> 01:21:08,810
Huck joined with Tom.

1493
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:09,910
Huck fell asleep.

1494
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,370
Then Joe fell asleep.

1495
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,850
Tom sat for a long time, watching the others.

1496
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:16,610
Then he stood up.

1497
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:21,889
He found two pieces of thin wood on which
he could write.

1498
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:28,170
After writing on the wood, he put one piece
in Joe’s hat.

1499
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,929
He put the other in his pocket.

1500
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:33,580
Then, carefully, he moved away among the trees.

1501
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:39,650
When he knew that they could not hear him,
he began to run toward the river.

1502
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:42,000
Tom Learns What Is Happening

1503
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,280
A few minutes later Tom was walking into the
water toward the shore where the riverboat

1504
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,280
was tied.

1505
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,219
The stream was not wide here, but it was strong.

1506
01:21:51,219 --> 01:21:52,630
It carried Tom south.

1507
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,639
But after a while he arrived at the river’s
edge.

1508
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:01,460
He found a good place and pulled himself out
of the water.

1509
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:04,599
He began walking north through the trees,
near the shore.

1510
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:08,790
He arrived at an open area, across the river
from the village.

1511
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,950
The riverboat was lying near.

1512
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,150
Everything was quiet under the stars.

1513
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:16,480
Watching with both his eyes, he entered the
water again.

1514
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:22,389
There was a small boat tied behind the large
boat.

1515
01:22:22,389 --> 01:22:25,590
Soon he was pulling himself into the small
boat.

1516
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:29,800
After a minute or two he heard a bell.

1517
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,570
The riverboat began to move.

1518
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:38,079
He knew that this was the last time it would
cross the river that night.

1519
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,170
Twelve minutes later the boat stopped.

1520
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:44,460
Tom was quickly in the water again, swimming
to the shore.

1521
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:49,090
Soon he had jumped over the fence behind his
aunt’s house.

1522
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:52,869
He looked through a window into a lighted
room.

1523
01:22:52,869 --> 01:22:57,079
There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s
mother.

1524
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:58,349
They were talking.

1525
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:02,909
They were beside the bed, and the bed was
between them and the door.

1526
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:08,699
Tom went to the door and opened it quietly.

1527
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:15,889
He thought that he might be able to go inside
without being seen.

1528
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:20,020
He began moving carefully, on his knees.

1529
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:22,380
“I feel a wind.

1530
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,469
Is that door open?” said Aunt Polly.

1531
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:26,469
“How strange!

1532
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:29,449
Many strange things are happening now.

1533
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:32,440
Sid, go and close the door.”

1534
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,870
Quickly Tom went under the bed.

1535
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:36,530
Sid did not see him.

1536
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:39,179
“But,” said Aunt Polly, “he was not
bad.

1537
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:44,849
He was only wild and full of life, like any
young animal.

1538
01:23:44,849 --> 01:23:47,469
He did not wish to do bad things.

1539
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:50,670
And no boy ever had a kinder heart.”

1540
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,040
She began to weep.

1541
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,890
“My Joe was the same.

1542
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:58,530
He was not really bad.

1543
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:02,170
And he was always kind.

1544
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:08,000
And now I shall never see him again!”

1545
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,659
“I am sorry now for so many things!

1546
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:19,400
Only yesterday the cat—” Weeping, Aunt
Polly told about the cat and the Painkiller.

1547
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,310
Tom was weeping a little now.

1548
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,880
He could hear Mary weeping also.

1549
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,469
Had he really always been a good boy?

1550
01:24:26,469 --> 01:24:30,500
It was quite surprising to think this.

1551
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,300
But now he was beginning to believe it.

1552
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,200
He wished to rush out from under the bed.

1553
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,811
He wished to fill his aunt with joy.

1554
01:24:39,811 --> 01:24:40,811
But he remained still and listened.

1555
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:42,989
Their small boat had been found five or six
miles down the river.

1556
01:24:42,989 --> 01:24:43,989
Now hope for them was gone.

1557
01:24:43,989 --> 01:24:47,090
On Sunday the whole village would pray in
the church, for the boys’ souls.

1558
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,170
Mrs. Harper went home.

1559
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:52,290
Sid and Mary went to bed.

1560
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:56,020
Then Aunt Polly prayed for Tom.

1561
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:59,469
Her words and her old voice were filled with
love.

1562
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,190
Tom’s tears began falling again.

1563
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:02,909
Then she got into bed.

1564
01:25:02,909 --> 01:25:06,710
She talked to herself and she turned over
again and again.

1565
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:09,119
Tom remained quiet for a long time.

1566
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:10,710
But at last she was still.

1567
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:14,280
Now the boy came out and looked down at her.

1568
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:19,530
He loved her and he was very sorry for her.

1569
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:25,340
He took from his pocket the piece of wood
with his writing on it.

1570
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,600
He placed it on a table.

1571
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,320
She would see it there in the morning.

1572
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,270
But then a new thought came to him.

1573
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,380
He considered it.

1574
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,320
His face grew bright.

1575
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,680
He put the wood into his pocket again.

1576
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,420
Then he kissed his aunt’s lips, and went
out the door.

1577
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:50,079
He returned to the river and to the riverboat.

1578
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:59,980
There was a man who guarded the boat, but
he would be sleeping.

1579
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,270
Tom knew that.

1580
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:05,300
It was easy to take the small boat.

1581
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:09,670
He got into it and moved it first up the river.

1582
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,449
Then he crossed to the other shore.

1583
01:26:12,449 --> 01:26:19,020
He had often crossed the river in a small
boat, and he knew how to do it.

1584
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:22,590
He considered taking the small boat to the
island.

1585
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:25,389
A real pirate would keep the boat.

1586
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:31,820
But people would try to find it, and they
might find the boys also.

1587
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,889
He got out of the boat and walked south along
the shore.

1588
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:42,310
At daylight he could look straight across
the stream and see the island.

1589
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:43,310
He rested.

1590
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,540
Then he entered the water.

1591
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,300
Soon he was on the island.

1592
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:50,150
He heard Joe say:

1593
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:51,150
“No.

1594
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,150
Tom is true, Huck.

1595
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,300
He will return.

1596
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,520
What has he been doing?

1597
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,520
I wonder.”

1598
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,520
“Here I am!”

1599
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,520
cried Tom, stepping out from among the trees.

1600
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,020
In a short time they had caught more fish
and were eating them.

1601
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,300
Tom told his adventures.

1602
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,840
Then Tom found a place in the shade.

1603
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,400
There he was able to sleep until noon.

1604
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,400
A Night Surprise

1605
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,520
The boys played in the water and on the shore.

1606
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,800
But the next day Joe was very sad.

1607
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,270
Would he ever be happy again?

1608
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,430
It did not seem possible.

1609
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:19,989
Huck also was sad.

1610
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:26,460
Tom was not happy, but he tried to seem happy.

1611
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:35,579
He had something interesting to tell them,
but he was not yet ready to speak.

1612
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:42,810
However, if they did not feel better soon,
he would be forced to tell it.

1613
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:48,750
He said, trying to seem happy, “I think
there have been pirates on this island before.

1614
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:55,190
How would you like to find an old box full
of money?

1615
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,949
We should go and hunt for it.”

1616
01:27:58,949 --> 01:28:02,180
But the other boys were not interested.

1617
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,290
Joe said, “Boys, I want to go home.

1618
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:07,260
It is very lonely here.”

1619
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,449
“Oh, no, Joe.

1620
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,210
You will feel better soon,” said Tom.

1621
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,650
“Think of the good fishing here.”

1622
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:16,920
“I am not interested in fishing.

1623
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,639
I want to go home.”

1624
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:25,130
“But, Joe, this is the best swimming place.”

1625
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:28,170
“I do not want to swim.

1626
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:31,270
I want to go home.”

1627
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,270
“Baby!

1628
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:35,600
You want to see your mother.”

1629
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,550
“Yes, I do want to see my mother.

1630
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:47,590
And you would want to see your mother, if
you had a mother.

1631
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,590
I am not a baby.”

1632
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,889
“But you like it here, Huck?

1633
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,650
You want to stay?

1634
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:53,410
You and I will stay?”

1635
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,880
Huck said, “Y-e-s.”

1636
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,210
He did not seem very sure.

1637
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:03,989
“Let Joe go, if he wants to go,” Tom said.

1638
01:29:03,989 --> 01:29:06,880
“We do not need him.”

1639
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:14,610
Joe began to walk into the water to start
swimming toward the shore where the village

1640
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,610
was.

1641
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:16,780
Tom looked at Huck.

1642
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:18,080
Huck looked away.

1643
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,550
Then Huck said, “I want to go, Tom.

1644
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:24,150
We can go, Tom, can’t we?”

1645
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,150
“I won’t!

1646
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:26,320
You can go.

1647
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,920
But I am going to stay.”

1648
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,520
Huck started to walk sadly away.

1649
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,560
Tom felt a strong desire to follow.

1650
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:42,810
He hoped that they would stop, but they went
slowly forward.

1651
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:50,560
Suddenly, Tom knew that it had become very
lonely and quiet.

1652
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,579
He ran after the other boys, shouting, “Wait!
Wait!

1653
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:55,679
I want to tell you something.”

1654
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:00,040
They stopped and turned, and he began walking
into the water toward them.

1655
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:05,639
They listened to him without an answering
word or smile.

1656
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:09,650
But after a while they began to understand.

1657
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:12,680
Then they shouted with joy.

1658
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:19,110
They said that he should have told them his
plan sooner.

1659
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:23,739
That night, after eating, Tom wanted to learn
to smoke.

1660
01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:26,900
Joe wanted to try, also.

1661
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:31,389
With Huck’s help, they began.

1662
01:30:31,389 --> 01:30:32,730
Tom said, “This is easy.

1663
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:34,580
I could have learned long ago.”

1664
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:36,120
“This is nothing,” said Joe.

1665
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,120
“I could smoke all day.

1666
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,120
I do not feel sick.”

1667
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,119
Tom said, “I wish that the other boys could
see us now.

1668
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:44,119
Listen.

1669
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:45,119
We won’t tell them.

1670
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:49,239
And some time when they are with us, I will
say, ‘Joe, I want to smoke.’

1671
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:53,860
And you will say, ‘My tobacco is not very
good.’

1672
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,910
And I will say, ‘It does not need to be
good if it is strong enough.’

1673
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,579
And then we will both start smoking and surprise
them.”

1674
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,050
“That will be good, Tom!

1675
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:03,100
I wish we could do it now!”

1676
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,969
“And we will tell them that we learned to
smoke when we were pirates.

1677
01:31:06,969 --> 01:31:09,530
And they will wish that they had been here!”

1678
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,530
The talk continued.

1679
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:13,380
But after a little time, there was less talk.

1680
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,630
Joe said, “I have lost my knife.

1681
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:17,560
I am going to find it.”

1682
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,489
Tom said, “Let me help you.

1683
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:22,710
You go that way and I will go this way.

1684
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,320
No, do not come, Huck.

1685
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,610
We can find it.”

1686
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:28,099
Huck sat down again and waited an hour.

1687
01:31:28,099 --> 01:31:29,630
Then he was lonely, and he went to find his
friends.

1688
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:31,130
Both were very white, both were asleep.

1689
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:35,800
But he knew that what had troubled them was
gone now.

1690
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,280
That night they did not talk much.

1691
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,270
When Huck began to smoke, they said no, that
something they had eaten made them feel a

1692
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:41,270
little sick.

1693
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:47,290
In the middle of the night Joe opened his
eyes and called to the other boys.

1694
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:53,869
There was a strange heaviness in the air,
and it made them all afraid.

1695
01:31:53,869 --> 01:31:57,070
The night was very hot, but they moved near
to each other and near to the fire.

1696
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,510
Sitting like that, they waited.

1697
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,430
A sudden light filled the sky.

1698
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:03,960
It turned night into day, and then it was
gone.

1699
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:09,330
A fearful noise rolled across the sky and
slowly ended far away.

1700
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:12,020
A breath of cold wind passed.

1701
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:19,180
The sudden light appeared and went away again,
and the noise that followed came sooner and

1702
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:21,389
was more fearful each time.

1703
01:32:21,389 --> 01:32:23,900
A little rain began to fall.

1704
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,989
“Quick, boys, run for cover!”

1705
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:26,989
Tom shouted.

1706
01:32:26,989 --> 01:32:31,000
They jumped up and ran, each toward a different
place.

1707
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,960
A strong wind rushed through the trees.

1708
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:40,620
The bright light appeared and went away, appeared
and went away again.

1709
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:43,750
The fearful noise seemed never to stop.

1710
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:48,679
And now a heavy rain came down and ran in
streams over the ground.

1711
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:52,050
The boys shouted, but their voices were lost
in the storm.

1712
01:32:52,050 --> 01:33:01,619
After some time they came to the place where
the old sail was and pulled it over them.

1713
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:06,850
It was a wild night for these boys.

1714
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,760
The wind caught the old sail and carried it
away.

1715
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,760
Trees fell.

1716
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:16,010
The storm increased until they feared that
it might carry the island away.

1717
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:20,780
But the storm grew weaker and weaker and peace
returned.

1718
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:24,830
The boys found that their fire was not quite
dead.

1719
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:29,580
They put more wood on it, making it burn brightly
again.

1720
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:33,460
They found some of their meat and cooked it.

1721
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:38,719
Then they sat by their fire until morning,
talking of the night’s adventure, because

1722
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,050
there was no dry place for them to sleep.

1723
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:47,429
When the sun began to shine, they rested in
its warm light, near the shore.

1724
01:33:47,429 --> 01:33:51,800
There they remained, sleeping, until the sun
became too hot.

1725
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,320
Then they had something to eat again.

1726
01:33:54,320 --> 01:34:01,420
The desire for home was now strong in all
of them.

1727
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:07,560
Tom tried to find a new game to interest them.

1728
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,619
He found one.

1729
01:34:09,619 --> 01:34:13,050
They were not pirates now.

1730
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:18,550
They were Indians and had many fierce battles.

1731
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:27,190
However, when the day ended, they smoked together,
as Indians always did to show that they were

1732
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:28,199
at peace.

1733
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:34,730
And two of them learned joyfully that now
they could smoke a little tobacco without

1734
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:35,730
being sick.

1735
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:37,400
The Success of Tom’s Plan

1736
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:48,190
But there was no joy in the little town that
same afternoon.

1737
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:52,599
The village was more quiet than usual.

1738
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:53,909
The people had little to say to each other.

1739
01:34:53,909 --> 01:34:56,290
The children had no pleasure in their games.

1740
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,210
Becky Thatcher was walking near the school.

1741
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:01,930
She thought, “Oh, I wish I had not returned
to Tom that bright, shining ball he gave me!

1742
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:05,040
I have nothing to help me remember him.

1743
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,780
He is gone now, and I shall never, ever see
him again.”

1744
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,559
She walked away with tears rolling down her
face.

1745
01:35:13,559 --> 01:35:21,940
Then a large group of boys and girls, friends
of Tom and Joe, came to the school and stood

1746
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:27,020
looking over the fence into the yard where
they had played together.

1747
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:32,659
They spoke of things Tom and Joe had said,
and of things Tom and Joe had done.

1748
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:37,070
They tried to learn who was the last to see
the two boys.

1749
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:44,469
The children who were the last to talk with
Tom and Joe felt very important indeed.

1750
01:35:44,469 --> 01:35:51,469
One boy who also wished to feel important
said, “I had a fight with Tom Sawyer, and

1751
01:35:51,469 --> 01:35:53,290
he was stronger than I was.”

1752
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,969
But most of the boys could say that.

1753
01:35:55,969 --> 01:36:01,679
The next morning the church bell did not stop
as it usually did after calling the people

1754
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,679
to church.

1755
01:36:02,679 --> 01:36:03,699
It continued to ring.

1756
01:36:03,699 --> 01:36:05,710
The people from the village gathered.

1757
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:14,340
Outside the church they talked, but in the
church all was very quiet.

1758
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:18,220
The little church was filled with people.

1759
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:33,159
After a long time Aunt Polly entered, followed
by Sid and Mary and by the Harper family.

1760
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:35,690
All were wearing black clothes.

1761
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,680
The other people in the church stood up.

1762
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:44,100
They remained standing while the two families
walked to the front of the church and sat

1763
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,100
down.

1764
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,100
It was quiet again.

1765
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,280
All prayed, and then a song followed.

1766
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:52,690
Now the church leader began to talk of the
boys.

1767
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,590
He told how good they had been.

1768
01:36:55,590 --> 01:37:03,010
People were sorry to remember that they had
not seen the truth earlier when they had thought

1769
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:05,300
that these boys were bad.

1770
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,050
Tears were falling from all eyes.

1771
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:12,290
The sound of the church door, opening slowly,
was heard.

1772
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:16,340
One pair of eyes, and then another, turned
to look.

1773
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:22,550
Then all in the church seemed to turn at the
same time, and people rose and watched while

1774
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:25,469
the three dead boys walked to the front of
the church.

1775
01:37:25,469 --> 01:37:29,650
Tom was first, Joe next, and last came Huck.

1776
01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:32,130
They had been listening to every word!

1777
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:35,400
Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers put their
arms around Tom and Joe.

1778
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:40,060
Huck stood alone, not knowing what to do.

1779
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:44,510
He started to move away, but Tom stopped him
and said:

1780
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:46,350
“Aunt Polly, this is not right.

1781
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:48,960
Some person must be glad to see Huck.”

1782
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,860
“And some person shall be.

1783
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,900
I am glad to see him, dear boy!”

1784
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:56,550
She put her arms around him also.

1785
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,590
And now Huck felt more strange than before.

1786
01:37:59,590 --> 01:38:00,590
“Sing!

1787
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:01,590
And sing your best!”

1788
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:03,000
cried the church leader.

1789
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,460
And all the people did sing.

1790
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:11,090
There had never been such singing in that
church.

1791
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:15,739
Tom Sawyer, the Pirate, knew that no moment
in his life could be prouder than this.

1792
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:16,739
Tom’s Wonderful Dream

1793
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:20,160
That was Tom’s great plan—to return home
with the other pirates and go to the church

1794
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,330
to hear people pray for their souls.

1795
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:29,719
They had returned across the river in the
darkness the night before, and had stayed

1796
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:32,570
in the forest until nearly daylight.

1797
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:39,730
They had entered the church and finished their
sleep there before the people came.

1798
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:43,960
Then they appeared at the most important moment.

1799
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:50,250
The next morning Aunt Polly and Mary were
very loving toward Tom.

1800
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:53,790
He had everything that he wanted to eat.

1801
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:56,660
There was much more talk than usual.

1802
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,880
Aunt Polly spoke:

1803
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,920
“We can laugh now, Tom.

1804
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,909
But you were not very kind to let me suffer.

1805
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:10,889
You came across the river to surprise us in
the church.

1806
01:39:10,889 --> 01:39:19,099
Why could you not come across the river to
tell me that you were not really dead?”

1807
01:39:19,099 --> 01:39:23,650
“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,”
said Mary.

1808
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:27,020
“I believe that you would have done it,
if you had thought of it.”

1809
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,610
“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly.

1810
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:30,460
Her face was brighter at this thought.

1811
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,590
“Would you, if you had thought of it?

1812
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:38,090
I hope that you love me enough to do it.

1813
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:39,739
Did you think of it?”

1814
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:42,059
“Tom is always rushing,” Mary said.

1815
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,219
“He never thinks.”

1816
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:44,219
“Sid would have thought.

1817
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:45,389
And Sid would have come.

1818
01:39:45,389 --> 01:39:48,880
Tom, some day you will be sorry.

1819
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:54,380
You will wish that you had cared more for
me.

1820
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,650
But then it will be too late.”

1821
01:39:56,650 --> 01:39:59,460
“I do care for you,” said Tom.

1822
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,870
“I wish that I had thought.

1823
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:03,869
But I dreamed about you.”

1824
01:40:03,869 --> 01:40:06,679
“A cat does as much as that.

1825
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:08,290
What did you dream?”

1826
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:12,159
“I dreamed that I saw you sitting there
by the bed.

1827
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,610
Sid and Mary were sitting with you.

1828
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:17,760
And I dreamed that Joe Harper’s mother was
here.”

1829
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,510
“Indeed she was, one night.

1830
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:21,110
Did you dream any more?”

1831
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:22,110
“Yes.

1832
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,840
But I can’t remember all of it.”

1833
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,840
“Try, Tom.

1834
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,840
Try to remember.”

1835
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:31,380
“You said that the door must be open because
you could feel the wind coming in.

1836
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,179
You said that was strange.

1837
01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:34,610
And you told Sid—”

1838
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:36,760
“What did I tell Sid, Tom?”

1839
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,270
“You told him—oh, you told him to close
the door.

1840
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:44,270
And you were talking about me.

1841
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,540
I remember better now.

1842
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,840
You said that I was not bad.

1843
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:54,440
You said that I was only wild and full of
life like a—like any young animal.”

1844
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:59,650
“I never heard anything like this in all
my life!

1845
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:02,409
And some people say that dreams are never
true.

1846
01:41:02,409 --> 01:41:03,800
Tell me more, Tom.”

1847
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,880
“And then you began to weep.”

1848
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,920
“Yes, I did.

1849
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:07,920
I did.”

1850
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,679
“Then Mrs. Harper began to weep.

1851
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,920
She said that Joe was good, also.

1852
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,260
And then you told about my giving the Painkiller
to the cat.

1853
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:23,190
And then there was a lot of talk about finding
our bodies, and about praying in the church

1854
01:41:23,190 --> 01:41:24,190
on Sunday.”

1855
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,550
“It is all true!”

1856
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:27,530
“And Mrs. Harper went home.

1857
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:35,800
And you prayed for me—and I could see you
and hear every word.

1858
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,230
And you went to bed.

1859
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:39,390
And I was very sorry for you.

1860
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:42,290
And I had a letter for you.

1861
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:46,270
It was on a piece of wood.

1862
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:49,020
On the wood were the words, ‘We are not
dead—we are away being pirates.’

1863
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,890
I kissed you on the lips and went away again.”

1864
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:53,139
“Did you, Tom?

1865
01:41:53,139 --> 01:41:54,139
Did you?”

1866
01:41:54,139 --> 01:41:55,139
She took him in her arms.

1867
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:58,380
“It was very kind, but it was only a dream,”
said Sid.

1868
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,530
“Be quiet, Sid!

1869
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:01,980
And Tom, here is a big apple for you.

1870
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,380
And now, you children, go to school.”

1871
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:06,630
Tom walked slowly and proudly, feeling that
all eyes were watching him.

1872
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:09,250
Smaller boys followed him, proud to be seen
with him.

1873
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:12,770
Boys of his own size tried not to show that
they knew he had been away.

1874
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:13,770
But they did know.

1875
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:17,250
They wished that they had sun-browned skin
like his.

1876
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:20,090
They wished that they were as famous.

1877
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:24,510
Tom decided that he no longer was interested
in Becky Thatcher.

1878
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,760
Being famous was enough pleasure for him.

1879
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:30,349
When Becky arrived at school, Tom seemed not
to see her.

1880
01:42:30,349 --> 01:42:31,429
But he saw her playing with other boys and
girls.

1881
01:42:31,429 --> 01:42:35,110
He saw that she often came near him and looked
at him.

1882
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:36,830
And he began talking to Amy Lawrence.

1883
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:43,620
Becky tried to go away from him, but her feet
would not do as she wished.

1884
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:47,180
They carried her near to the group around
Tom.

1885
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:52,400
She said to one of the girls, “Mary, where
were you yesterday?

1886
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,340
I wanted to tell you about the picnic.”

1887
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,420
“Oh, whose picnic?”

1888
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:00,760
“My mother is going to let me have one.”

1889
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:05,230
“I hope that she will let me come.”

1890
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:11,390
“It will be my picnic and I may ask those
that I want.

1891
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,079
I want you and all my friends to come.”

1892
01:43:13,079 --> 01:43:16,409
She looked at Tom, but he was talking to Amy
Lawrence.

1893
01:43:16,409 --> 01:43:20,540
Now the others in the group began asking if
they could go to the picnic.

1894
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:23,849
Soon all had asked except Tom and Amy.

1895
01:43:23,849 --> 01:43:25,409
Tom turned away.

1896
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:30,520
Becky’s legs were shaking and tears came
to her eyes.

1897
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:37,909
She would not let the others see her sadness.

1898
01:43:37,909 --> 01:43:46,420
She went away alone, to think of what to do.

1899
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:54,909
When Tom saw her again, she and a boy named
Alfred Temple were sitting together, looking

1900
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:56,900
at a book.

1901
01:43:56,900 --> 01:44:00,760
Now Tom suddenly wanted to stop talking to
Amy.

1902
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:06,199
He escaped from her and went to look again
at Becky and Alfred Temple.

1903
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:10,380
And Becky seemed not to see Tom.

1904
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:15,119
But she saw him, and she saw that he was suffering,
and she was glad.

1905
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,719
“That Alfred Temple!”

1906
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,790
Tom thought.

1907
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:20,989
“Alfred Temple and his fine clothes!

1908
01:44:20,989 --> 01:44:23,119
I will catch you!

1909
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,790
I will take you and—”

1910
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:35,640
He began hitting the air as if he were fighting
with the other boy.

1911
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,970
At noon Tom went home.

1912
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:44,500
Becky again looked at the book with Alfred,
hoping that Tom would see them.

1913
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,140
But Tom did not appear.

1914
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:48,060
Suddenly she began to weep.

1915
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,040
She left Alfred and walked away.

1916
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:56,059
Alfred followed, hoping to find some way to
make her happy again.

1917
01:44:56,059 --> 01:44:59,130
But she said: “Go away!

1918
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:02,040
I never want to see you again!”

1919
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,570
Alfred was quick to understand.

1920
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:07,400
Becky had been trying to make Tom suffer.

1921
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:10,059
Alfred went into the school.

1922
01:45:10,059 --> 01:45:16,449
He saw one of Tom’s books—and thought
how he could hurt Tom.

1923
01:45:16,449 --> 01:45:21,980
He opened the book to the page they were to
study that afternoon.

1924
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:32,300
He destroyed the page in a manner that would
make it seem that Tom had done it.

1925
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,719
Becky, looking in the window, saw him do it.

1926
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,469
She thought of telling Tom.

1927
01:45:36,469 --> 01:45:38,929
Then she decided that she would not.

1928
01:45:38,929 --> 01:45:42,871
She would let the schoolteacher beat Tom for
what had happened to his book.

1929
01:45:42,871 --> 01:45:43,871
Tom Tells the Truth

1930
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:49,680
Tom arrived at home feeling very sad, and
his aunt’s first words made him feel no

1931
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:50,680
better.

1932
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,449
“Tom, I ought to beat you!”

1933
01:45:52,449 --> 01:45:54,820
“Aunt Polly, what have I done?”

1934
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:59,559
“I went to see Mrs. Harper to tell her about
your dream.

1935
01:45:59,559 --> 01:46:03,900
Joe had already told her that you were here
that night.

1936
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:08,650
Tom, I do not know what to think of a boy
like you.

1937
01:46:08,650 --> 01:46:09,909
I believed your story of your dream.

1938
01:46:09,909 --> 01:46:10,989
I expected her to believe it.

1939
01:46:10,989 --> 01:46:15,409
Why did you let me be such a fool?”

1940
01:46:15,409 --> 01:46:20,869
“Aunt Polly, I wish I had not done it.

1941
01:46:20,869 --> 01:46:22,440
I did not think.”

1942
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,440
“Oh, child, you never think.

1943
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,440
You never think of anything but yourself.

1944
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,900
You could think enough to come here and laugh
at our troubles.

1945
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:33,160
You could think to tell that story of a dream.

1946
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:38,120
But you could not think to save us from suffering.”

1947
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,590
“Aunt Polly, I know that it was bad.

1948
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:44,500
But I did not plan to be bad.

1949
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,809
And I did not come here that night to laugh
at you.

1950
01:46:48,809 --> 01:46:52,989
I came to tell you that we were not drowned.

1951
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:56,190
I did not want you to be sad.”

1952
01:46:56,190 --> 01:47:00,199
“Tom, I would be thankful to believe that.

1953
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:03,750
But I doubt that you had such a thought.”

1954
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:07,000
“Yes, I did, I did.

1955
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,530
It is the truth.

1956
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:15,380
I wanted to save you from being sad.”

1957
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:19,450
“Then why did you not tell me, child?”

1958
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:28,840
“You began talking of Sunday and all the
people praying for us in the church.

1959
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,980
And I began thinking about going there on
Sunday.

1960
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:38,949
And I put my letter in my pocket and went
away.”

1961
01:47:38,949 --> 01:47:40,000
“What letter?”

1962
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,830
“The letter to tell you that we were pirates.

1963
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:50,050
I wish now that you had opened your eyes when
I kissed you.”

1964
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:52,599
“Did you kiss me, Tom?

1965
01:47:52,599 --> 01:47:54,130
Are you sure?”

1966
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:56,170
“Yes, I did, Aunt.”

1967
01:47:56,170 --> 01:47:57,980
“Why did you kiss me?”

1968
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:03,369
“Because I loved you and you were weeping
in your sleep and I was sorry.”

1969
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:05,530
The words sounded like the truth.

1970
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:08,409
The old lady said, “Kiss me again, Tom!

1971
01:48:08,409 --> 01:48:10,320
And then go to school.”

1972
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:16,320
When he was gone, she looked at his little
coat.

1973
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,730
In the pocket she found his piece of wood
with the writing on it.

1974
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:24,380
She read the words, with tears falling from
her eyes.

1975
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:29,940
Then she said, “Now I could forget anything
bad that the boy does.

1976
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:32,840
I could forget a million bad things.”

1977
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,500
Becky Has a Problem

1978
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,900
Tom was happy again.

1979
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:41,900
He started walking to school, and soon saw
Becky Thatcher, also going toward the school.

1980
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:44,150
Quickly he ran to her and said:

1981
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:48,430
“I am sorry I acted as I did this morning,
Becky.

1982
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:51,160
I won’t ever be like that again.

1983
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:53,079
Please let us be friends.”

1984
01:48:53,079 --> 01:48:56,350
The girl stopped and looked into his face.

1985
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:58,390
“Go away, Mr. Thomas Sawyer.

1986
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:01,250
I will never speak to you again.”

1987
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:03,290
Then she started walking again.

1988
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:09,050
Tom was so surprised that he could think of
nothing to say.

1989
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:11,570
And he was filled with anger.

1990
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:17,699
If she were a boy, he knew that he would fight
her.

1991
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:20,480
Becky was also full of anger.

1992
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:25,680
She was thinking of the pleasure of watching
the teacher beat Tom for destroying a page

1993
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,680
in his book.

1994
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:29,020
She did not know that she would soon have
trouble also!

1995
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:32,770
The teacher had a book that he was studying.

1996
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:37,409
Every day he would read some pages when he
was not busy.

1997
01:49:37,409 --> 01:49:41,670
Every boy and girl in the school wondered
about this book, but none had ever seen its

1998
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:42,670
pages.

1999
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:46,030
Now, as Becky passed the teacher’s table,
she saw the book.

2000
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:49,010
She opened it and began to look at it.

2001
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:50,010
Then Tom appeared at the door.

2002
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:51,110
Becky hurried to close the book.

2003
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:56,030
Her hand caught the page, and suddenly, it
was in two pieces.

2004
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:57,670
Becky began to weep.

2005
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:01,679
“You are bad, Tom Sawyer, to come and watch
me!

2006
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:09,150
And now you will tell the teacher, and he
will beat me, and what shall I do!

2007
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:12,230
I have never been beaten in school.

2008
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:16,280
But I know what is going to happen to you.

2009
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:19,120
You wait and you will see!”

2010
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,480
Then, weeping, she ran outside.

2011
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:26,210
Tom said to himself: “What a fool a girl
is!

2012
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:29,040
What is a beating in school?

2013
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,460
That is nothing.

2014
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:34,250
And I will not tell who opened the book.

2015
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:37,150
The teacher will ask who did it.

2016
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:39,219
He will call each name.

2017
01:50:39,219 --> 01:50:45,250
And when he says the right one, he won’t
need an answer.

2018
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:48,429
He will see the answer in her face.”

2019
01:50:48,429 --> 01:50:52,300
School began, and soon Tom’s book was discovered.

2020
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:58,900
He said that he had not destroyed the page,
but the teacher did not believe him.

2021
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,889
Tom had his beating.

2022
01:51:00,889 --> 01:51:04,869
Becky watched, trying to feel happy about
this.

2023
01:51:04,869 --> 01:51:10,099
But she almost stood up to tell the truth
about Alfred Temple.

2024
01:51:10,099 --> 01:51:11,619
An hour passed.

2025
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:14,659
The boys and girls were all busy with their
books.

2026
01:51:14,659 --> 01:51:16,260
The teacher opened his book.

2027
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:17,550
Tom looked at Becky.

2028
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,429
He had seen small and hunted animals in the
forest.

2029
01:51:20,429 --> 01:51:22,250
Now Becky seemed like one of them.

2030
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:25,239
He wished that he could help her.

2031
01:51:25,239 --> 01:51:27,380
But what could he do?

2032
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:32,400
The next moment the teacher stood before the
school.

2033
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,520
Every eye turned away from his.

2034
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,429
All the boys and girls were afraid of him.

2035
01:51:36,429 --> 01:51:37,429
He spoke:

2036
01:51:37,429 --> 01:51:38,909
“Who did this to my book?”

2037
01:51:38,909 --> 01:51:41,060
There was not a sound.

2038
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,060
“Benjamin Rogers?”

2039
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,060
“No.”

2040
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:44,060
“Joe Harper?”

2041
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,060
“No.”

2042
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,060
“Amy Lawrence?”

2043
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,060
“No.”

2044
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,060
“Gracie Miller?”

2045
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,060
“No.”

2046
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,060
The next name was Becky Thatcher.

2047
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,760
Tom was shaking from head to foot.

2048
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,510
He saw her face, white with fear.

2049
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:55,510
“Rebecca Thatcher, look at me!

2050
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:58,300
Did you do this to my book?”

2051
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:05,390
Tom jumped to his feet and shouted, “I did
it!”

2052
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:08,900
All looked at him.

2053
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:14,659
They could not believe what they had heard.

2054
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:15,830
This was madness.

2055
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:19,219
Tom stepped forward to take his beating.

2056
01:52:19,219 --> 01:52:27,730
The surprise, the thankfulness, the love shining
from Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for

2057
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:28,840
a hundred beatings.

2058
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,949
Old Muff’s Friend

2059
01:52:29,949 --> 01:52:31,070
Summer had come.

2060
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:34,040
For several months there would be no school.

2061
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,780
Tom discovered that the days were too long.

2062
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:39,750
He did not have enough to do.

2063
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:43,660
He decided to make a record of everything
that happened.

2064
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:46,179
But nothing happened during three days.

2065
01:52:46,179 --> 01:52:50,599
He decided that a record would be of no value.

2066
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:52,409
Becky Thatcher had gone away.

2067
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:58,520
During the summer she was living in another
town with her father and her mother.

2068
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:03,639
The thought of the fearful killing in the
graveyard was always in Tom’s mind.

2069
01:53:03,639 --> 01:53:06,310
It was like a pain.

2070
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:08,969
It would not go away.

2071
01:53:08,969 --> 01:53:10,000
Then Tom became sick.

2072
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,989
For two long weeks Tom remained in bed without
knowing what was happening in the village.

2073
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:17,350
He was very ill.

2074
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:19,500
He was interested in nothing.

2075
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,070
Then he seemed to be better.

2076
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:24,579
But after a day he was ill again.

2077
01:53:24,579 --> 01:53:27,310
He was in bed for three more weeks.

2078
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:31,020
In the warm, sleepy village something began
to happen.

2079
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:36,130
A judge was coming to listen to the story
of the killing in the graveyard.

2080
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:38,650
He would decide what to do about Muff Potter.

2081
01:53:38,650 --> 01:53:39,880
Every person in the village talked of this.

2082
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,820
Tom could not escape from it.

2083
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:45,150
Every word made his heart beat faster.

2084
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:50,289
He was always afraid when people talked to
him about it.

2085
01:53:50,289 --> 01:53:53,780
He took Huck to a lonely place.

2086
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:59,179
He wanted to be sure that Huck had not told
the story.

2087
01:53:59,179 --> 01:54:00,500
“Huck, have you told about—that?”

2088
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:01,500
“About what?”

2089
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:02,500
“You know what.”

2090
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,500
“Oh.

2091
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,500
No, I have not.”

2092
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,500
“Never a word?”

2093
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,500
“Never a word.

2094
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,500
Why do you ask?”

2095
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,500
“I was afraid.”

2096
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:12,860
“Tom Sawyer, we would not live two days
if that story was told.

2097
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,059
You know that.”

2098
01:54:14,059 --> 01:54:17,790
“Huck, could any person make you tell?”

2099
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:22,060
“If I wanted that Indian Joe to drown me,
they could make me tell.”

2100
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:23,060
“Good!

2101
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:26,000
I think that we are safe if we do not talk.

2102
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,949
But we should make another agreement.

2103
01:54:28,949 --> 01:54:31,400
It will be more sure.”

2104
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:35,820
They made an agreement, as before, signed
in blood.

2105
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:39,349
“What is the talk that you hear, Huck?”

2106
01:54:39,349 --> 01:54:40,349
“Talk?

2107
01:54:40,349 --> 01:54:44,349
It is all Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter.

2108
01:54:44,349 --> 01:54:48,440
It makes me want to go where no one can see
me.”

2109
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,960
“I hear the same talk.

2110
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:52,030
They are going to hang him.

2111
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:54,440
Do you feel sorry for him sometimes?”

2112
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:55,480
“Almost always—almost always.

2113
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:58,590
He has never done anything to hurt any person.

2114
01:54:58,590 --> 01:55:03,830
He only fishes to get some money so that he
can get drunk.

2115
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:07,219
He is really good.

2116
01:55:07,219 --> 01:55:22,030
Once he gave me a fish, when he really did
not have enough for himself.

2117
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:26,560
And he helped me at other times when I needed
help.”

2118
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,790
“He helped me, also, Huck.

2119
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:31,460
He helped me to catch fish.

2120
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:35,910
I wish that I could get him out of jail.”

2121
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:38,579
“We can’t get him out, Tom.

2122
01:55:38,579 --> 01:55:43,389
And if we did, they would catch him again.”

2123
01:55:43,389 --> 01:55:44,389
“Yes.

2124
01:55:44,389 --> 01:55:49,820
But I do not like to hear what they say.

2125
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,330
For he never did—that.”

2126
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:54,440
“And I do not like it, Tom.”

2127
01:55:54,440 --> 01:56:00,730
The boys talked for a long time, but it did
not make them happy.

2128
01:56:00,730 --> 01:56:03,840
As night came, they were near the little jail.

2129
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,510
Perhaps they hoped that something good might
happen.

2130
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:07,510
But nothing happened.

2131
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:09,909
They went to the window and gave Potter some
tobacco.

2132
01:56:09,909 --> 01:56:10,909
They had done this before.

2133
01:56:10,909 --> 01:56:13,179
He was always very thankful for their gifts,
and his thanks always hurt them.

2134
01:56:13,179 --> 01:56:15,389
This time the hurt went deeper when Potter
said:

2135
01:56:15,389 --> 01:56:17,380
“You have been good to me, boys.

2136
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,130
Better than the others in this town.

2137
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:21,619
And I won’t forget, I won’t.

2138
01:56:21,619 --> 01:56:27,150
Often I say to myself, ‘I was good to all
the boys.

2139
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,530
I showed them where the good fishing was.

2140
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,550
I was their friend when I could be a friend.

2141
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,880
And now they forget old Muff in his trouble.

2142
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,960
But Tom does not forget, and Huck does not—they
do not forget him,’ I say, ‘and I won’t

2143
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:35,960
forget them.’

2144
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:37,429
“But, boys, I did a fearful thing.

2145
01:56:37,429 --> 01:56:38,429
I was drunk.

2146
01:56:38,429 --> 01:56:40,909
That is the only way that I can explain it.

2147
01:56:40,909 --> 01:56:44,270
Now I must hang for it, and that is right.

2148
01:56:44,270 --> 01:56:45,650
It is best, also.

2149
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:47,980
I hope that it is.

2150
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,780
But we won’t talk about that.

2151
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:51,620
I won’t make you feel sad.

2152
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:53,449
You have been my friends.

2153
01:56:53,449 --> 01:56:56,390
“But what I want to say is this.

2154
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:57,489
Never get drunk.

2155
01:56:57,489 --> 01:57:00,800
Then you won’t ever be where I am now.

2156
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,650
“Stand where I can see you.

2157
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:07,760
It is a pleasure to see friendly faces when
a man is in trouble like this.

2158
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,739
You are the only ones who come here.

2159
01:57:09,739 --> 01:57:11,159
Good friendly faces—good friendly faces.

2160
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:14,190
Stand on each other’s shoulders and let
me touch your faces.

2161
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:15,190
Good!

2162
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:16,190
Let me touch your hands, also.

2163
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:21,909
Little hands, and weak, but they have helped
Muff Potter.

2164
01:57:21,909 --> 01:57:28,849
And they would help him more if they could.”

2165
01:57:28,849 --> 01:57:32,380
Tom went home feeling very, very sad.

2166
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:36,270
His dreams that night were full of fearful
things.

2167
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:39,920
During the next two days he went to the town
meetinghouse.

2168
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,369
The judge was there, listening to the story
of the killing.

2169
01:57:43,369 --> 01:57:48,520
Tom wished to go into the meetinghouse to
hear what was happening but he forced himself

2170
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,340
to stay outside.

2171
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:53,270
Huck was having the same experience.

2172
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:56,039
They were careful not to meet each other.

2173
01:57:56,039 --> 01:58:01,690
They would go away from the meetinghouse,
but soon they would return.

2174
01:58:01,690 --> 01:58:04,400
Tom listened when people came out.

2175
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,660
The news was always bad.

2176
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:14,099
At the end of the second day people said that
Indian Joe’s story never changed.

2177
01:58:14,099 --> 01:58:18,980
There was no doubt what the judge would decide.

2178
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:24,989
Tom was out late that night, and he entered
the house through the window.

2179
01:58:24,989 --> 01:58:30,850
He could not sleep for several hours.

2180
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:36,780
All the people in the village went to the
meetinghouse the next morning.

2181
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,059
This was to be the important day.

2182
01:58:40,059 --> 01:58:46,380
Potter, who appeared to have no hope, was
brought in.

2183
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:49,530
All eyes were turned to him.

2184
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,550
And Indian Joe was there, too.

2185
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:51,550
Then the judge arrived.

2186
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:54,460
Now a man was asked to tell what he knew about
the killing.

2187
01:58:54,460 --> 01:59:00,380
He said that he had found Muff Potter washing
his hands in a stream.

2188
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:07,260
It was very early on the morning after the
killing.

2189
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:11,010
Another man was asked to tell his story.

2190
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:13,940
He told about finding the knife near the doctor’s
body.

2191
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:17,090
Then a second man spoke about the knife.

2192
01:59:17,090 --> 01:59:19,969
He knew that it belonged to Potter.

2193
01:59:19,969 --> 01:59:23,219
A man who had studied law sat beside Muff
Potter.

2194
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:24,949
He was there to help Potter.

2195
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:28,219
But he asked no questions as these men told
their stories.

2196
01:59:28,219 --> 01:59:29,219
It seemed strange.

2197
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:32,960
Was he not trying to prove that Potter had
not killed the doctor?

2198
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,929
More men told their stories.

2199
01:59:35,929 --> 01:59:38,360
And the man beside Potter asked them no questions.

2200
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:41,429
After a while, all the stories against Potter
had been told.

2201
01:59:41,429 --> 01:59:43,820
Then the man beside Potter stood up.

2202
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:45,820
He spoke to the judge:

2203
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:50,000
“Your Honor, we planned to prove that Muff
Potter was drunk that night.

2204
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,040
We planned to prove that he did not know what
he was doing.

2205
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,150
But we have changed our plans.

2206
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:57,960
We wish to ask Thomas Sawyer some questions.”

2207
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:00,409
Surprise appeared on every face, including
Potter’s.

2208
02:00:00,409 --> 02:00:02,170
Every eye was watching Tom.

2209
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:04,270
He stood up and walked forward.

2210
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:07,429
He looked very wild, because he was deeply
afraid.

2211
02:00:07,429 --> 02:00:08,659
The questions began.

2212
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:16,469
“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the night
of the killing at about the hour of twelve?”

2213
02:00:16,469 --> 02:00:21,520
Tom looked at Indian Joe, and he could not
speak.

2214
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,330
The people listened, but the words did not
come.

2215
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:26,920
After a few moments, however, the boy had
more strength.

2216
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:29,389
Some of the people could hear as he said:

2217
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:30,409
“In the graveyard!”

2218
02:00:30,409 --> 02:00:31,409
“Louder, please.

2219
02:00:31,409 --> 02:00:32,440
Do not be afraid.

2220
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:33,440
You were—”

2221
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,440
“In the graveyard.”

2222
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:37,409
A cold smile appeared on Indian Joe’s face.

2223
02:00:37,409 --> 02:00:38,989
Then it was gone.

2224
02:00:38,989 --> 02:00:41,369
“Were you near Hoss Williams’s grave?”

2225
02:00:41,369 --> 02:00:42,369
“Yes.”

2226
02:00:42,369 --> 02:00:43,369
“Louder, please.

2227
02:00:43,369 --> 02:00:44,369
How near were you?”

2228
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:46,800
“As near as I am to you.”

2229
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,250
“Could you be seen?”

2230
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:50,250
“No.

2231
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:54,010
I was behind the trees at the edge of the
grave.”

2232
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:55,639
“Was another person with you?”

2233
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:56,639
“Yes.

2234
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:57,639
I went there with—”

2235
02:00:57,639 --> 02:00:58,639
“That is enough.

2236
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:01,770
We will call him when we need him.

2237
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:03,630
Did you carry something there?”

2238
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:05,230
Tom did not answer.

2239
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:06,440
“Speak, my boy.

2240
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:08,440
The truth is always honorable.

2241
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,449
What did you carry there?”

2242
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:11,660
“Only a—a—dead cat.”

2243
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:15,190
There was a little laughing.

2244
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:17,810
The judge ordered it to stop.

2245
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:20,800
“We plan to show the bones of that cat.

2246
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,950
Now, my boy, tell us everything that happened—tell
it as you wish, but tell it all and do not

2247
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:27,950
be afraid.”

2248
02:01:27,950 --> 02:01:28,950
Tom began slowly.

2249
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:30,099
Then his words came more and more easily.

2250
02:01:30,099 --> 02:01:31,369
Every eye looked at him.

2251
02:01:31,369 --> 02:01:35,429
With open lips the people listened to his
words, forgetting everything but his story.

2252
02:01:35,429 --> 02:01:37,610
Now he came to the end.

2253
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:40,910
Interest became greater and greater.

2254
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:47,909
“—and as the doctor hit Muff Potter with
the board and Muff Potter fell, Indian Joe

2255
02:01:47,909 --> 02:01:52,280
jumped with the knife and—”

2256
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:58,660
Indian Joe jumped toward a window, striking
all who tried to hold him.

2257
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:03,870
In a moment he was gone.

2258
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:06,789
Days of Delight and Nights of Fear

2259
02:02:06,789 --> 02:02:08,869
Tom was famous once again.

2260
02:02:08,869 --> 02:02:14,380
The old people loved him and the young people
wished that they were like him.

2261
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:16,710
His name appeared in the village newspaper.

2262
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:23,309
There were people who believed that he might
some day become President of the United States,

2263
02:02:23,309 --> 02:02:25,090
if he escaped hanging.

2264
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:31,770
Now all were kind to Muff Potter, forgetting
that they had not been kind before.

2265
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:37,340
Tom’s days were days of joy, but his nights
were filled with fear.

2266
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,679
Indian Joe was in all his dreams.

2267
02:02:40,679 --> 02:02:43,060
Poor Huck felt the same.

2268
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:45,650
His name had not been called in the meetinghouse.

2269
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:50,280
Because Indian Joe had run away, Huck’s
story was not needed.

2270
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:55,950
But Huck was afraid that his part in the story
might be told.

2271
02:02:55,950 --> 02:03:02,030
Huck no longer trusted any human being, because
Tom had broken their agreement.

2272
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:08,580
Every day, Muff Potter’s thanks made Tom
glad that he had told his story.

2273
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:13,719
Every night he wished that he had not opened
his mouth.

2274
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:20,880
Sometimes Tom was afraid that Indian Joe would
never be caught.At other times he was afraid

2275
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:24,869
that Indian Joe would be caught.

2276
02:03:24,869 --> 02:03:32,210
He felt sure that he never could be safe again
until Indian Joe was dead and he had seen

2277
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,340
the dead body.

2278
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,710
Indian Joe had not been found.

2279
02:03:35,710 --> 02:03:37,140
The slow days passed.

2280
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:40,530
With each day Tom became a little less afraid.

2281
02:03:40,530 --> 02:03:41,900
>Dead People and Spirits

2282
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:53,679
There comes a time in every boy’s life when
he wants to hunt for gold and silver that

2283
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:56,560
pirates have put deep in the earth.

2284
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:59,030
This desire suddenly came to Tom.

2285
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:02,690
He tried to find Joe Harper, but failed.

2286
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:08,170
He tried to find Ben Rogers, but Ben had gone
fishing.

2287
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:10,390
Then he met Huck Finn.

2288
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:16,599
Tom took him to a place where they could be
alone, and he explained.

2289
02:04:16,599 --> 02:04:17,599
Huck agreed.

2290
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:23,030
Huck always agreed to do anything that would
require time but not money.

2291
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:27,760
He had no money, but much time.

2292
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,240
“Where?” said Huck.

2293
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,719
“Oh, almost anywhere.”

2294
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:36,650
“Do you mean that there is money in the
ground everywhere?”

2295
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:37,650
“No.

2296
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:41,500
It is in very special places, Huck.

2297
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:47,030
Sometimes on islands, sometimes in old boxes
under the end of a dead branch of an old tree,

2298
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:52,079
but mostly under the floor in a house where
the spirits of the dead gather.”

2299
02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:53,239
“Who puts it there?”

2300
02:04:53,239 --> 02:04:55,550
“People who take it away from other people.”

2301
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:57,870
“Why do they put it in the ground?

2302
02:04:57,870 --> 02:05:02,090
If I were rich, I would spend my money and
enjoy it.”

2303
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:03,090
“I would, too.

2304
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:04,190
But these people are different.”

2305
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:06,040
“Do they never return and get it?”

2306
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,040
“No.

2307
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:10,179
They think that they will, but they forget
where it is.

2308
02:05:10,179 --> 02:05:11,219
Or they die.”

2309
02:05:11,219 --> 02:05:13,710
“How are you going to find it, Tom?

2310
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:15,030
Where will you look?”

2311
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:21,949
“We tried hunting for gold on the island
when we were pirates.

2312
02:05:21,949 --> 02:05:25,340
I know where there is a house full of spirits.

2313
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:28,730
And there are old trees with dead branches
everywhere.”

2314
02:05:28,730 --> 02:05:32,120
“Is there gold and silver under every dead
branch?”

2315
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:33,120
“No!

2316
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,120
That would not be possible!”

2317
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:36,199
“How do you know which one to choose?”

2318
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:37,429
“Choose all of them!”

2319
02:05:37,429 --> 02:05:39,590
“Tom, we shall be working all summer!”

2320
02:05:39,590 --> 02:05:41,139
“What is wrong with that?

2321
02:05:41,139 --> 02:05:42,989
We might find a hundred dollars.

2322
02:05:42,989 --> 02:05:44,530
Or valuable stones, like diamonds.

2323
02:05:44,530 --> 02:05:46,070
How would you like that?”

2324
02:05:46,070 --> 02:05:47,310
Huck’s eyes were shining.

2325
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:51,090
“Give me the hundred dollars, and you can
have the valuable stones, like diamonds.”

2326
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:53,130
“Have you ever seen a diamond, Huck?”

2327
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:55,679
“I do not remember that I have.”

2328
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:56,769
“Kings have diamonds.

2329
02:05:56,769 --> 02:06:01,869
And I have heard that some of them are worth
a dollar or more!

2330
02:06:01,869 --> 02:06:03,690
Kings have hundreds of them.”

2331
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:06,239
“I do not know any kings, Tom.”

2332
02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:10,250
“If you go to Europe you will see them jumping
around.”

2333
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:11,340
“Do they jump?”

2334
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,340
“Jump?

2335
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,340
No.”

2336
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:14,340
“Why did you say that they jumped?”

2337
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:16,829
“Oh, I mean only that you will see kings
everywhere.

2338
02:06:16,829 --> 02:06:17,829
Not jumping.

2339
02:06:17,829 --> 02:06:18,829
Why should they jump?

2340
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:21,110
But you will see many of them.”

2341
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:26,619
The boys got some gardening things, used for
making holes in the earth.

2342
02:06:26,619 --> 02:06:33,170
Then they walked three miles to an old tree
with a single dead branch.

2343
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:38,500
They were very hot and they sat in the shade
of another tree to rest and smoke.

2344
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:43,809
Tom said, “Huck, if we find some money,
what will you do with it?”

2345
02:06:43,809 --> 02:06:44,809
“Spend it!

2346
02:06:44,809 --> 02:06:47,599
Before my father takes it and spends it.

2347
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,869
What will you do with yours?”

2348
02:06:49,869 --> 02:06:51,290
“I will get married.”

2349
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:52,290
“Married!

2350
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:54,430
Tom, you would be a fool.

2351
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:57,210
Think of my father and mother.

2352
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:58,210
Fight!

2353
02:06:58,210 --> 02:07:00,610
They were fighting all the time.

2354
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:01,610
I remember.”

2355
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:04,570
“The girl I will marry won’t fight.”

2356
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:07,210
“Tom, they are all the same.

2357
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:08,530
Who is she?”

2358
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:10,739
“I won’t tell you now.”

2359
02:07:10,739 --> 02:07:16,019
“If you marry, I will be more lonely than
I am now.”

2360
02:07:16,019 --> 02:07:17,340
“No, you won’t.

2361
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:20,440
You will come to live with me.

2362
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,730
Now we must start working.”

2363
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:23,230
They worked for half an hour.

2364
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:27,320
They found no box of money in the hole that
they were making.

2365
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,600
They worked another half hour.

2366
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:30,969
Then Huck said:

2367
02:07:30,969 --> 02:07:35,070
“Is the money always so deep in the ground?”

2368
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:36,070
“Not always.

2369
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,170
Perhaps this is not the right place.”

2370
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:43,719
They began again on the other side of the
tree.

2371
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:46,910
They worked without talking for a while.

2372
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:51,150
Then Huck stopped to dry his hot face, and
said:

2373
02:07:51,150 --> 02:07:53,260
“Where do we try next?”

2374
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:58,329
“There is an old tree on Cardiff Hill behind
Mrs. Douglas’s house.”

2375
02:07:58,329 --> 02:08:00,870
“That might be a good place.

2376
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:04,580
But won’t she take the money away from us?

2377
02:08:04,580 --> 02:08:06,370
It is her land.”

2378
02:08:06,370 --> 02:08:12,320
“If you find money in the ground, it belongs
to you.

2379
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:16,200
It does not belong to the owner of the land.”

2380
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:17,619
That was fine.

2381
02:08:17,619 --> 02:08:18,619
The work continued.

2382
02:08:18,619 --> 02:08:19,710
After a while Tom said:

2383
02:08:19,710 --> 02:08:22,030
“We must be in the wrong place again.

2384
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:23,030
Oh, I understand!

2385
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:24,030
What a fool I was!

2386
02:08:24,030 --> 02:08:30,309
We must know where the shade of the dead branch
is under the light of the moon in the middle

2387
02:08:30,309 --> 02:08:31,309
of the night.

2388
02:08:31,309 --> 02:08:33,570
That is where we must hunt for the money.”

2389
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:37,719
The boys stopped work, and returned to the
tree that night.

2390
02:08:37,719 --> 02:08:39,219
It was a lonely place.

2391
02:08:39,219 --> 02:08:40,219
They talked little.

2392
02:08:40,219 --> 02:08:47,889
When they felt that the right hour had come,
they found the shade in the moonlight under

2393
02:08:47,889 --> 02:08:51,289
the branch, and began to work.

2394
02:08:51,289 --> 02:08:52,960
Their interest was strong.

2395
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:53,960
They worked fast.

2396
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,790
The hole grew deeper and deeper.

2397
02:08:55,790 --> 02:09:01,409
But every time they found something hard in
the earth, it was only a rock.

2398
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:04,420
After a while Tom said:

2399
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:07,440
“Huck, we are wrong again.”

2400
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,850
“We can’t be wrong.

2401
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:12,429
We saw the shade of the branch.”

2402
02:09:12,429 --> 02:09:14,679
“But perhaps the time was not right.

2403
02:09:14,679 --> 02:09:15,679
We guessed.

2404
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:16,909
We did not know.”

2405
02:09:16,909 --> 02:09:19,150
“We should stop trying,” Huck said.

2406
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:21,199
“We never know the right time.

2407
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:26,230
And I do not like the middle of the night,
with spirits of dead men around.

2408
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:33,510
I feel that there is one behind me all the
time, and I am afraid to turn.”

2409
02:09:33,510 --> 02:09:35,750
“I feel the same, Huck.

2410
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:44,440
And they almost always put a dead man in the
hole to guard the gold and silver.”

2411
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,440
“They do?”

2412
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,809
“Yes, they do.

2413
02:09:46,809 --> 02:09:49,179
I have always heard that.”

2414
02:09:49,179 --> 02:09:53,530
“Tom, I do not like to be where there are
dead people.

2415
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:56,039
They will certainly cause trouble for us.”

2416
02:09:56,039 --> 02:10:00,470
“And I do not like it.

2417
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:05,630
Suppose this one should lift his head?

2418
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:09,309
He is only bones now.

2419
02:10:09,309 --> 02:10:13,710
Suppose his bones should speak to us.”

2420
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:15,100
“Stop that talk, Tom!

2421
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:16,820
That is a fearful idea.”

2422
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:19,239
“Huck, I do not like this place.

2423
02:10:19,239 --> 02:10:20,619
We can try another.”

2424
02:10:20,619 --> 02:10:21,619
“Where?”

2425
02:10:21,619 --> 02:10:23,380
“The old house where the spirits gather.”

2426
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:26,660
“Tom, I do not like spirits or their houses.

2427
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:30,719
Dead people may speak to us, perhaps.

2428
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:38,699
But they won’t come quietly behind us, as
spirits do, then suddenly make fearful noises.”

2429
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:42,239
“But, Huck, spirits travel around only at
night.

2430
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:46,030
We can go to the house in the day.”

2431
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:47,230
“That is true.

2432
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:52,469
But people never go near that house in the
day or the night.”

2433
02:10:52,469 --> 02:10:55,679
“That is because a man was killed there.

2434
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:58,909
But nothing is seen except in the night.

2435
02:10:58,909 --> 02:11:02,020
And then only blue lights are seen.”

2436
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:06,909
“When you see those blue lights, Tom, you
know that spirits are near.

2437
02:11:06,909 --> 02:11:08,639
Because only spirits use them.

2438
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:12,300
I agree to go to the house, if you want to.

2439
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:15,699
But I do not think that it is safe.”

2440
02:11:15,699 --> 02:11:17,270
Sleeping Spirits — A Box Full of Gold

2441
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:22,480
On Saturday, soon after noon, the boys met
at the dead tree.

2442
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:28,429
They smoked and talked in the shade.

2443
02:11:28,429 --> 02:11:33,099
Then they worked a little at their last hole.

2444
02:11:33,099 --> 02:11:35,019
They had no great hope.

2445
02:11:35,019 --> 02:11:41,320
But Tom said that people sometimes stopped
working when they had almost found the box

2446
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:42,320
of gold.

2447
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,970
Then another person came and with very little
work discovered it.

2448
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:49,820
However, they failed to find anything.

2449
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:55,780
But they felt that they had done everything
that was possible.

2450
02:11:55,780 --> 02:12:04,139
When they arrived at the old house, they were
first afraid to go in.

2451
02:12:04,139 --> 02:12:10,380
It was completely quiet there under the hot
sun, and very lonely.

2452
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:15,800
Then they went without any noise to the door
and looked in, shaking with fear.

2453
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,850
They saw a room with an earthen floor.

2454
02:12:17,850 --> 02:12:23,800
There was a place where a fire had been built,
windows without glass, and dust everywhere.

2455
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:24,800
They entered.

2456
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,630
They did not dare to speak.

2457
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,599
Their ears were ready to hear any small sound.

2458
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:32,670
Their legs were ready to carry them quickly
outside again.

2459
02:12:32,670 --> 02:12:34,780
Soon their fear became less.

2460
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:36,889
They looked around with interest.

2461
02:12:36,889 --> 02:12:40,560
Then they wanted to look at the room above.

2462
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,909
They found nothing up there and were starting
to go down when—

2463
02:12:43,909 --> 02:12:44,909
“Be quiet!”

2464
02:12:44,909 --> 02:12:45,909
Tom’s voice was shaking.

2465
02:12:45,909 --> 02:12:46,909
“What is it?”

2466
02:12:46,909 --> 02:12:48,159
Huck asked, becoming white with fear.

2467
02:12:48,159 --> 02:12:49,159
“There!...

2468
02:12:49,159 --> 02:12:50,159
Hear it?”

2469
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:51,159
“Yes!...

2470
02:12:51,159 --> 02:12:52,159
We must run!”

2471
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:53,159
“We can’t move.

2472
02:12:53,159 --> 02:12:54,159
They are coming toward the door.”

2473
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:57,750
The boys were on the floor, looking down into
the room below through holes, sick with fear,

2474
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:58,750
waiting.

2475
02:12:58,750 --> 02:12:59,750
Two men entered.

2476
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:03,929
Both boys had seen one of the men in the village.

2477
02:13:03,929 --> 02:13:05,430
He seemed to be very old.

2478
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:13,199
He had long white hair hanging around his
shoulders, and much white hair growing on

2479
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:14,290
his face.

2480
02:13:14,290 --> 02:13:21,900
It seemed to the village people sad that he
could neither hear nor speak.

2481
02:13:21,900 --> 02:13:25,079
The other man was a stranger.

2482
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:28,409
He was wearing very old clothes.

2483
02:13:28,409 --> 02:13:32,309
His face was not pleasant.

2484
02:13:32,309 --> 02:13:35,969
He was talking as they entered.

2485
02:13:35,969 --> 02:13:44,869
The two men sat on the ground, with their
backs against the wall.

2486
02:13:44,869 --> 02:13:46,410
“No,” said the other man.

2487
02:13:46,410 --> 02:13:48,889
“I have been thinking about it.

2488
02:13:48,889 --> 02:13:50,930
I do not like it.

2489
02:13:50,930 --> 02:13:52,920
They will catch us.”

2490
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:59,159
“You fool!” said the man who was believed
not to be able to hear or speak.

2491
02:13:59,159 --> 02:14:00,599
“You are afraid!”

2492
02:14:00,599 --> 02:14:03,960
The boys were now shaking with fear.

2493
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:06,369
This man was Indian Joe!

2494
02:14:06,369 --> 02:14:09,730
Joe said, “We were not caught before.”

2495
02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:11,280
“But that was different.”

2496
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:15,820
“They may catch us here in this house,”
Joe said.

2497
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:18,369
“I wanted to leave here yesterday.

2498
02:14:18,369 --> 02:14:22,429
But those boys were playing on Cardiff Hill.

2499
02:14:22,429 --> 02:14:24,960
They would have seen us.”

2500
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,480
“Those boys” were Tom and Huck.

2501
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,680
They were shaking again.

2502
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:39,440
What would have happened to them yesterday,
if they had come to this house?

2503
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:44,630
They wished that they had waited a year before
coming.

2504
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:48,579
The two men had brought some food, and they
began to eat.

2505
02:14:48,579 --> 02:14:51,900
After a while Joe said, “When it is dark,
go home.

2506
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:54,079
Wait there until you hear from me.

2507
02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:56,890
I will go into the village once again.

2508
02:14:56,890 --> 02:14:59,460
Then we will do the job we planned.

2509
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:00,699
And then we will run.

2510
02:15:00,699 --> 02:15:02,250
Far away.

2511
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:03,460
Now I need sleep.

2512
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:05,880
You stay here as a guard.”

2513
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,489
He was soon asleep.

2514
02:15:07,489 --> 02:15:12,989
And then the guard, too, was soon sleeping.

2515
02:15:12,989 --> 02:15:15,909
The boys took a long, thankful breath.

2516
02:15:15,909 --> 02:15:16,909
Tom said:

2517
02:15:16,909 --> 02:15:17,909
“Now is our chance—come!”

2518
02:15:17,909 --> 02:15:19,389
Huck said, “I can’t.

2519
02:15:19,389 --> 02:15:22,409
I would die if they opened their eyes.”

2520
02:15:22,409 --> 02:15:25,909
He would not move, and Tom started to leave
alone.

2521
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:32,809
But the old floor made so much noise that
he stopped, almost dead with fear.

2522
02:15:32,809 --> 02:15:37,570
Slowly time passed until the sun was going
down.

2523
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:41,409
Indian Joe sat up and called the other.

2524
02:15:41,409 --> 02:15:46,790
He said, “It is almost time for us to be
moving.

2525
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:50,210
What shall we do with our money?

2526
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:55,590
Shall we leave it here until we are ready
to run?

2527
02:15:55,590 --> 02:15:59,500
Six hundred silver dollars is heavy to carry.

2528
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:02,579
We can put it in the ground.

2529
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:03,579
Deep.”

2530
02:16:03,579 --> 02:16:04,739
His friend agreed.

2531
02:16:04,739 --> 02:16:17,829
He went to the place where the fire had been
built, raised one of the big stones from the

2532
02:16:17,829 --> 02:16:22,380
earthen floor, and took out a big bag of money.

2533
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:25,539
The boys began to forget their fears.

2534
02:16:25,539 --> 02:16:28,590
Six hundred dollars would make six boys rich!

2535
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:35,520
And they knew where Indian Joe was putting
it.

2536
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:41,051
Indian Joe was in a corner, making a hole
in the ground with his knife.

2537
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:46,200
The boys did not dare to speak, but they looked
at each other often.

2538
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:48,150
These looks were easy to understand.

2539
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:54,340
Their meaning was, “Oh, how glad we are
now to be here!”

2540
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:57,230
They heard Indian Joe’s knife strike something
hard.

2541
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:58,820
“Look here!” he said.

2542
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:01,200
“What is it?” said his friend.

2543
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,970
“It is an old box,” Joe said.

2544
02:17:03,970 --> 02:17:05,560
“Help me lift it.

2545
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:07,940
No, I have broken it open.”

2546
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:09,890
He put his hand in the box and then brought
it out again.

2547
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:10,890
“Man, this is money!”

2548
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:15,090
The two men looked at the handful of money.

2549
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:16,480
It was gold.

2550
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:24,160
Now the men found the gardening things that
the boys had been using and had placed in

2551
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:28,160
another corner when they came into the house.

2552
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,510
Using them, they started to work.

2553
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:32,830
They soon had the box out of the earth.

2554
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:39,080
It was not large, but it had once been very
strong, with iron bands to hold the wood together.

2555
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:42,740
“There are thousands of dollars here,”
said Indian Joe.

2556
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:48,730
“Now it won’t be necessary to do that
job in the village,” said the other.

2557
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:51,750
Indian Joe said, “You do not understand.

2558
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:54,730
I am not doing that job only for money.

2559
02:17:54,730 --> 02:18:00,720
Wrong was done to me, and I am going to pay
them for it.

2560
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,240
I need your help.

2561
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:07,040
Go home until I tell you to come.”

2562
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,092
“What do we do with this money?

2563
02:18:10,092 --> 02:18:11,092
Put it in the ground again?”

2564
02:18:11,092 --> 02:18:12,092
“Yes.”

2565
02:18:12,092 --> 02:18:13,220
(Delight for the boys above his head.)

2566
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:14,220
“No!”

2567
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:15,220
(Deep sadness above.)

2568
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:16,400
“Where did those gardening things come from?

2569
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:21,190
There was fresh earth on them.

2570
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:24,460
Who was here?

2571
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:29,810
We must take the money away.

2572
02:18:29,810 --> 02:18:36,600
I have a good place for it.

2573
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:39,760
At the Number Two place, under the cross.”

2574
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:43,260
“It is nearly dark enough to go.”

2575
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:47,760
Indian Joe went from window to window, looking
out.

2576
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,760
Then he said, “Who could have come here?

2577
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:55,171
Do you think they are in the room above us?”

2578
02:18:55,171 --> 02:18:56,171
The boys’ breath stopped.

2579
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:58,830
Indian Joe put his hand on his knife and started
to go up.

2580
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:01,700
The boys could not move; their strength was
gone.

2581
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:03,250
They heard Joe coming.

2582
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:07,900
Then they heard the sound of breaking wood,
and Joe fell to the ground.

2583
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:10,750
“No people are up there,” his friend said.

2584
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:13,251
“They saw us coming and they ran.

2585
02:19:13,251 --> 02:19:17,880
They thought that we were spirits or devils,
and they are running yet.”

2586
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:24,480
Soon the two men went out of the house with
the box of gold and the bag of silver dollars.

2587
02:19:24,480 --> 02:19:28,150
Tom and Huck watched them through holes in
the wall.

2588
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:29,550
But would the boys follow?

2589
02:19:29,550 --> 02:19:30,550
No.

2590
02:19:30,550 --> 02:19:37,120
They were happy enough to get away from the
house with no broken bones, and then return

2591
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:38,390
to the town.

2592
02:19:38,390 --> 02:19:40,490
They did not talk much.

2593
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:47,780
They decided to watch in the town for Indian
Joe, and then follow him to the Number Two

2594
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:48,780
place.

2595
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:49,780
Tom had a fearful thought.

2596
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:52,950
“Indian Joe said that he would pay wrong
with wrong.

2597
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:55,300
Was he talking about us, Huck?”

2598
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:59,050
Feeling suddenly weak, Huck almost fell to
the ground.

2599
02:19:59,050 --> 02:20:00,050
Doubts

2600
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:03,340
The adventure of the day troubled Tom’s
dreams that night.

2601
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:06,851
Four times he had his hands on that gold.

2602
02:20:06,851 --> 02:20:11,891
Four times he opened his eyes and discovered
that he had nothing.

2603
02:20:11,891 --> 02:20:17,660
In the early morning as he was in bed, thinking
of his great adventure, it all seemed strangely

2604
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:18,660
far away.

2605
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,920
It might have happened in another world, or
in a time long past.

2606
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:26,221
Then the thought came to him that the great
adventure itself must be a dream!

2607
02:20:26,221 --> 02:20:29,410
The amount of money was too big to be real.

2608
02:20:29,410 --> 02:20:34,920
He had never seen as much as half a hundred
dollars before.

2609
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:39,311
He decided to find Huck and let Huck talk.

2610
02:20:39,311 --> 02:20:42,341
He would ask Huck no questions.

2611
02:20:42,341 --> 02:20:48,851
If Huck did not speak of the adventure, then
Tom would know that it had been a dream.

2612
02:20:48,851 --> 02:20:55,711
Huck was sitting on the edge of a boat, with
his feet in the water.

2613
02:20:55,711 --> 02:20:56,820
He seemed very sad.

2614
02:20:56,820 --> 02:20:57,820
“Hello, Huck!”

2615
02:20:57,820 --> 02:20:58,820
“Hello yourself.”

2616
02:20:58,820 --> 02:20:59,820
No words for a minute.

2617
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:05,840
“Tom, if we had not put our gardening things
in that corner, we would have that money.”

2618
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:10,110
“It was not a dream, it was not a dream!

2619
02:21:10,110 --> 02:21:13,101
But I almost wish that it was.”

2620
02:21:13,101 --> 02:21:14,101
“Dream!

2621
02:21:14,101 --> 02:21:19,931
If Indian Joe had found us, you would know
that it was not a dream!

2622
02:21:19,931 --> 02:21:23,340
I have had dreams about him all night.”

2623
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:25,050
“We must find him!

2624
02:21:25,050 --> 02:21:26,311
Find the money!

2625
02:21:26,311 --> 02:21:29,181
We must find his Number Two place.

2626
02:21:29,181 --> 02:21:32,780
Perhaps it is the number of a house.”

2627
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:33,820
“No, Tom.

2628
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:41,010
The houses in this town do not have numbers.”

2629
02:21:41,010 --> 02:21:49,120
“Perhaps it is the number of a room in a
public house for travelers.

2630
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,120
Those rooms have numbers.”

2631
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,410
“Oh, that is the answer!

2632
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:54,340
There are only two public houses here.

2633
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:57,261
We can quickly learn about Number Two.”

2634
02:21:57,261 --> 02:22:00,190
“You stay here, Huck, until I return.”

2635
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:02,950
Tom was gone half an hour.

2636
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:11,780
He learned that in one public house a well-known
young man lived in room Number Two.

2637
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:16,040
But in the other public house, Number Two
was always closed.

2638
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:19,110
No person seemed to know much about it.

2639
02:22:19,110 --> 02:22:24,240
However, a light had been seen in the window
the night before.

2640
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:27,950
“That is Indian Joe’s Number Two, Huck.”

2641
02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:30,141
“I think you are right, Tom.

2642
02:22:30,141 --> 02:22:31,480
Now what will you do?”

2643
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:32,480
“Let me think.”

2644
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:34,061
Tom thought a long time.

2645
02:22:34,061 --> 02:22:35,061
Then he said:

2646
02:22:35,061 --> 02:22:36,330
“I will tell you.

2647
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:45,340
The door of Number Two opens on a little street
at the back of the house.

2648
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:49,061
We must wait for a dark night.

2649
02:22:49,061 --> 02:22:51,940
Then we shall try to get in.

2650
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:54,580
But if you see Indian Joe, follow him.

2651
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:59,910
And if he does not go to that Number Two,
it can’t be the place.”

2652
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:02,880
“I am afraid to follow him alone, Tom!”

2653
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,370
“It will be night.

2654
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:09,760
If I see him, and if it is dark, I will follow
him, I promise.

2655
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,510
He might be going straight to that money.

2656
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:15,160
You must not weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”

2657
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:16,811
Number Two — Huck as Guard

2658
02:23:16,811 --> 02:23:18,141
They waited three nights.

2659
02:23:18,141 --> 02:23:20,120
The fourth night was dark enough.

2660
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:22,570
The public house closed at a late hour, but
Tom and Huck were near.

2661
02:23:22,570 --> 02:23:24,670
Indian Joe had not been seen.

2662
02:23:24,670 --> 02:23:29,320
No other person had been in the street behind
the house.

2663
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:34,190
The two adventurers moved quietly toward the
door in the darkness.

2664
02:23:34,190 --> 02:23:40,410
Huck stopped, to remain as a guard, and Tom
went forward.

2665
02:23:40,410 --> 02:23:44,400
Then there was a long wait.

2666
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:45,400
To Huck it seemed hours.

2667
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:46,400
What had happened to Tom?

2668
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:47,931
Had he died from fear?

2669
02:23:47,931 --> 02:23:51,910
Huck’s breathing was very fast and his heart
beat madly.

2670
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:53,460
Suddenly Tom came rushing past.

2671
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:54,460
“Run!

2672
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:55,460
Run for your life!”

2673
02:23:55,460 --> 02:24:01,450
They never stopped running until they were
at the other end of the village.

2674
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:04,400
There stood an old building, now not used.

2675
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:08,010
As they entered, rain began to fall heavily.

2676
02:24:08,010 --> 02:24:09,030
“Huck, it was fearful!

2677
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:14,061
I tried and tried to open the door—and then
suddenly it opened without effort.

2678
02:24:14,061 --> 02:24:19,660
I stepped into the room, and—Huck, I almost
stepped on Indian Joe’s hand!”

2679
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:20,660
“No!”

2680
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:21,660
“Yes!

2681
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:22,740
He was there, asleep on the floor.

2682
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:23,740
Drunk, I believe.

2683
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:24,870
I turned and ran.”

2684
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:26,410
“Tom, did you see that box?”

2685
02:24:26,410 --> 02:24:32,300
“Huck, I did not wait to look around.

2686
02:24:32,300 --> 02:24:37,971
I did not see the box.

2687
02:24:37,971 --> 02:24:42,061
I did not see any cross.

2688
02:24:42,061 --> 02:24:44,751
I saw only a cup on the floor beside Indian
Joe.

2689
02:24:44,751 --> 02:24:47,710
And more to drink; the room is full of it.”

2690
02:24:47,710 --> 02:24:55,760
“Tom, if Joe is drunk, now is the time to
get that box.”

2691
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:56,760
“Is it?

2692
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:57,760
You get it.”

2693
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:58,760
Huck began to shake.

2694
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:00,090
“No, I believe not.”

2695
02:25:00,090 --> 02:25:01,090
“And I believe not, Huck.

2696
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:02,090
Listen, Huck.

2697
02:25:02,090 --> 02:25:03,090
Wait until we know that Indian Joe is not
in there.

2698
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,110
We can watch every night.

2699
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:06,421
Then we can go fast and get that box.”

2700
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:07,421
“I agree.

2701
02:25:07,421 --> 02:25:10,871
Let me watch all night and every night.

2702
02:25:10,871 --> 02:25:14,440
You do the other part of the job.”

2703
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:15,440
“I will.

2704
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:18,000
And now the rain has stopped.

2705
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,160
You go and watch.

2706
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:23,480
And when you want me at night, come to my
window and make a noise like a cat.”

2707
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:24,480
The Picnic — Indian Joe’s Job

2708
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:28,501
The next morning Tom heard glad news—Judge
Thatcher’s family had returned.

2709
02:25:28,501 --> 02:25:30,940
Both Indian Joe and the box of gold were not
so important for a while.

2710
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:32,030
More good news made the day perfect.

2711
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:35,040
The following day Becky would have her picnic.

2712
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:40,370
Before eleven in the morning the young people
were at Judge Thatcher’s house, ready to

2713
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:41,370
start.

2714
02:25:41,370 --> 02:25:44,400
Soon the happy group was walking toward the
river.

2715
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:50,851
They were going to ride down the river on
the old riverboat.

2716
02:25:50,851 --> 02:25:53,660
Sid did not go; he was sick.

2717
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:55,610
Mary stayed with him.

2718
02:25:55,610 --> 02:25:59,940
Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, “You will return
late.

2719
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:06,460
Perhaps you should stay all night at the home
of a girl friend who lives near the river.”

2720
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:08,381
“I can stay with Susy Harper, Mother.”

2721
02:26:08,381 --> 02:26:09,381
“Good.

2722
02:26:09,381 --> 02:26:10,381
And be a good girl.”

2723
02:26:10,381 --> 02:26:13,400
The boat took them three miles down the river.

2724
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:15,960
There it was tied to the shore.

2725
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:20,460
The crowd ran off the boat and into the forest.

2726
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:25,040
Soon shouting and laughing could be heard
from many places.

2727
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:27,480
After a while, all were hot and ready to rest.

2728
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:31,181
They met again near the boat, and began to
eat the good things they had brought with

2729
02:26:31,181 --> 02:26:32,181
them.

2730
02:26:32,181 --> 02:26:33,920
After eating, they rested in the shade of
the big trees.

2731
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:38,260
Then there was a shout: “Who is ready to
go to the cave?”

2732
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:39,290
All were ready.

2733
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:47,300
They got lights to guide them in the darkness
and started to walk up the hill.

2734
02:26:47,300 --> 02:26:50,540
The cave could be entered through an opening
in the hillside.

2735
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:56,330
A door had been placed across the opening,
but it was not closed.

2736
02:26:56,330 --> 02:26:57,360
Inside was a small, very cold room.

2737
02:26:57,360 --> 02:27:00,000
The walls were rock, and always had water
running down them.

2738
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,610
It was a strange pleasure to stand there in
the darkness and look out at the green valley

2739
02:27:02,610 --> 02:27:03,610
shining in the sunlight.

2740
02:27:03,610 --> 02:27:10,301
But the strangeness was soon past, and the
children began to play and run through other

2741
02:27:10,301 --> 02:27:12,240
parts of the cave.

2742
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:16,870
None of these parts was wide and some were
very small.

2743
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:20,700
Some led to other rooms made of rock.

2744
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:27,790
Some of these were very big; the children
could not see the top of them.

2745
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:32,370
A person might walk days and nights and never
find the end of this cave.

2746
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:37,431
He might go down and down, and yet further
down into the earth, always finding new parts

2747
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:38,431
and new rooms.

2748
02:27:38,431 --> 02:27:41,920
No person knew the whole cave.

2749
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:47,851
Only part of it was known, and people did
not go where others had not gone before.

2750
02:27:47,851 --> 02:27:53,091
Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any
person.

2751
02:27:53,091 --> 02:27:58,780
The children walked for almost a mile before
any of them started to return to the outside.

2752
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:04,061
Then one group after another began arriving
at the opening on the hillside.

2753
02:28:04,061 --> 02:28:07,700
They were surprised to see that it was almost
night.

2754
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:10,700
The boat’s bell had been calling for half
an hour.

2755
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:14,410
However, they thought this end to the day’s
adventures was delightful.

2756
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:16,860
Only the captain of the boat was sorry that
he had waited so long.

2757
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:19,960
Huck saw the lights of the returning riverboat.

2758
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:24,561
He was already watching for Indian Joe.

2759
02:28:24,561 --> 02:28:33,101
There were clouds in the sky and the night
was becoming very dark.

2760
02:28:33,101 --> 02:28:38,750
The people in the village began to go home
to sleep.

2761
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:41,780
The village clock was striking eleven and
nothing had happened.

2762
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:46,910
Huck also began to think of sleep.

2763
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:53,840
Then a noise came to his ear.

2764
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:56,290
The next moment two men passed near him.

2765
02:28:56,290 --> 02:28:57,650
One was carrying something.

2766
02:28:57,650 --> 02:29:00,491
It must be that box!

2767
02:29:00,491 --> 02:29:01,491
Should he call Tom?

2768
02:29:01,491 --> 02:29:02,491
No.

2769
02:29:02,491 --> 02:29:06,710
The men would carry away the box and it would
never be found again.

2770
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:08,280
He would follow them.

2771
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:12,591
Without shoes, as usual, Huck moved as quietly
as a cat.

2772
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:16,730
The men went toward the river, and then, turning,
went up Cardiff Hill.

2773
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:21,840
Passing the house of an old man named Jones,
they arrived at the top of the hill.

2774
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:25,250
There, among the trees, they could not be
seen.

2775
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:29,420
Huck stopped, listened, but heard no sound
except his own heart.

2776
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:33,980
He knew that he was not far from the house
of Mrs. Douglas, an old lady who lived alone.

2777
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:36,080
Then, very near, he heard a voice.

2778
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:38,271
It was Indian Joe.

2779
02:29:38,271 --> 02:29:41,010
He said, “There are lights.

2780
02:29:41,010 --> 02:29:44,420
It is late, but she is not alone.”

2781
02:29:44,420 --> 02:29:46,300
“I can’t see any lights.”

2782
02:29:46,300 --> 02:29:48,181
That was the other man.

2783
02:29:48,181 --> 02:29:49,690
Huck’s heart was cold.

2784
02:29:49,690 --> 02:29:53,080
This was the job Indian Joe had talked of!

2785
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,910
Mrs. Douglas had often been kind to Huck.

2786
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:59,000
Perhaps these men were planning to kill her.

2787
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:03,950
He wished that he dared to run to the house
and tell her.

2788
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:06,660
But the men would catch him.

2789
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:09,370
“Look from here,” said Indian Joe.

2790
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:12,240
“Now do you see the lights?”

2791
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:13,240
“Yes.

2792
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:14,650
Forget the job.”

2793
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:15,650
“Forget it!

2794
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:22,090
I have told you before, you can have her money,
I do not want it.

2795
02:30:22,090 --> 02:30:26,800
But her husband put me in jail.

2796
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,540
Then he died.

2797
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:31,641
I can’t hurt him.

2798
02:30:31,641 --> 02:30:33,900
But she is living yet.”

2799
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:36,681
“You must not kill her!”

2800
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:39,450
“I will not kill her.

2801
02:30:39,450 --> 02:30:47,580
But I am going to cut her face, and that hurts
a woman more than killing.

2802
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:51,950
You will help me or I will kill you.

2803
02:30:51,950 --> 02:31:00,101
And if I must kill you, I will kill her, too.

2804
02:31:00,101 --> 02:31:05,570
Then she can’t tell who killed you.”

2805
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:12,601
“If we must do it, then do it now.”

2806
02:31:12,601 --> 02:31:13,601
“No.

2807
02:31:13,601 --> 02:31:16,510
Wait until the house is dark.”

2808
02:31:16,510 --> 02:31:27,290
Huck knew that now all would be quiet, and
the quiet would be more fearful than the talk

2809
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:28,290
of killing.

2810
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:32,230
Very, very carefully he moved down the hill.

2811
02:31:32,230 --> 02:31:35,410
When he dared, he began to run.

2812
02:31:35,410 --> 02:31:39,271
He arrived at Mr. Jones’s house and beat
on the door.

2813
02:31:39,271 --> 02:31:44,551
Mr. Jones and his two strong sons opened a
window and looked out.

2814
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:45,990
“What is that noise?

2815
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:47,070
Who are you?

2816
02:31:47,070 --> 02:31:48,511
What do you want?”

2817
02:31:48,511 --> 02:31:49,950
“Let me come in—quick.”

2818
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:51,030
“Who are you?”

2819
02:31:51,030 --> 02:31:52,030
“Huckleberry Finn.

2820
02:31:52,030 --> 02:31:53,551
Quick, let me come in.”

2821
02:31:53,551 --> 02:31:54,641
“Huckleberry Finn, indeed.

2822
02:31:54,641 --> 02:31:55,971
Is that a name to make me open a door?

2823
02:31:55,971 --> 02:31:57,931
But let him come in, boys.

2824
02:31:57,931 --> 02:31:59,240
What does he want?”

2825
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:02,840
“Please never tell that I told you,” were
Huck’s first words.

2826
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:06,801
“I would surely be killed—but Mrs. Douglas
has been a good friend to me.

2827
02:32:06,801 --> 02:32:07,990
I want to tell you.”

2828
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:10,250
“Speak,” said the old man.

2829
02:32:10,250 --> 02:32:13,740
“We will never tell, boy.”

2830
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:21,980
Three minutes later the old man and his sons,
carrying guns, were going up the hill.

2831
02:32:21,980 --> 02:32:26,141
Huck went only part of the way.

2832
02:32:26,141 --> 02:32:29,150
Then he stopped behind a large stone, and
listened.

2833
02:32:29,150 --> 02:32:34,921
Suddenly he heard the guns and a cry.

2834
02:32:34,921 --> 02:32:42,461
He waited for nothing more, but ran down the
hill as fast as his legs could carry him.

2835
02:32:42,461 --> 02:32:44,290
The Old Man Reports — Hope Begins to Weaken

2836
02:32:44,290 --> 02:32:46,291
The next day was Sunday.

2837
02:32:46,291 --> 02:32:51,760
In the very early morning Huck called gently
at the old man’s door.

2838
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:53,860
“Please let me come in!

2839
02:32:53,860 --> 02:32:55,960
It is only Huck Finn.”

2840
02:32:55,960 --> 02:33:00,160
“That name will open this door night or
day, boy!”

2841
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:03,521
These were strange words to the boy’s ears.

2842
02:33:03,521 --> 02:33:07,130
He could not remember hearing any so kind
and pleasant before.

2843
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:10,700
The door was quickly opened, and he entered.

2844
02:33:10,700 --> 02:33:17,931
“Now, boy, I hope that you are hungry, because
as soon as the sun is up, we shall have something

2845
02:33:17,931 --> 02:33:19,021
hot to eat.

2846
02:33:19,021 --> 02:33:21,630
We hoped that you would come here again last
night.”

2847
02:33:21,630 --> 02:33:23,980
“When I heard the guns, I ran.

2848
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:24,980
I ran for three miles.

2849
02:33:24,980 --> 02:33:28,601
I came now because I want to know what happened.

2850
02:33:28,601 --> 02:33:30,721
I came before daylight, because I do not want
to meet those men, living or dead.”

2851
02:33:30,721 --> 02:33:32,030
“They are not dead, boy.

2852
02:33:32,030 --> 02:33:33,340
We are sorry for that.

2853
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:34,670
They heard us coming, and they ran.

2854
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:38,540
Then we went down to the village to get help.

2855
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:42,760
Men have gone to watch at the river.

2856
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:47,171
More men will hunt through the forest today.

2857
02:33:47,171 --> 02:33:49,631
My sons will join them.

2858
02:33:49,631 --> 02:33:53,551
I wish we had seen those two men.

2859
02:33:53,551 --> 02:33:56,980
Could you see them in the dark?”

2860
02:33:56,980 --> 02:33:59,921
“I can tell you about them.

2861
02:33:59,921 --> 02:34:04,690
One is a man that you have seen in the village.

2862
02:34:04,690 --> 02:34:06,820
He has long white hair.

2863
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:09,800
He can’t hear and he can’t talk.”

2864
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:14,061
Then he told about the other man’s face
and clothes.

2865
02:34:14,061 --> 02:34:21,370
When his sons had gone, Mr. Jones asked Huck
why he had followed the men up the hill.

2866
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:25,030
Huck told, after much thought, that one man
was Indian Joe.

2867
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:27,490
But he did not tell about the box of money.

2868
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:31,380
Soon people began coming to the house, and
Huck went where they could not see him.

2869
02:34:31,380 --> 02:34:34,830
Mrs. Douglas was among the first to come.

2870
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:40,601
She came to thank Mr. Jones for saving her
from being hurt by the men.

2871
02:34:40,601 --> 02:34:43,290
“You should not thank me,” he said.

2872
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:47,141
“There is another person who did more to
help you.

2873
02:34:47,141 --> 02:34:49,450
But he does not want thanks.”

2874
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:53,280
All the people in the village went to church
early that day.

2875
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:55,110
They wanted to talk about the two bad men.

2876
02:34:55,110 --> 02:35:00,211
The two had not been found, and nothing had
been learned about where they had gone.

2877
02:35:00,211 --> 02:35:04,791
Leaving the church, Mrs. Thatcher walked beside
Mrs. Harper.

2878
02:35:04,791 --> 02:35:09,450
She said, “Is my Becky going to sleep all
day?”

2879
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:10,450
“Your Becky?”

2880
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:11,450
“Yes.

2881
02:35:11,450 --> 02:35:12,980
She stayed with you last night, I believe.”

2882
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:13,980
“No.”

2883
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:14,980
Mrs. Thatcher stopped suddenly.

2884
02:35:14,980 --> 02:35:15,980
She seemed ill.

2885
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:18,721
At that moment Aunt Polly joined them.

2886
02:35:18,721 --> 02:35:21,750
She said, “Good morning, Mrs. Thatcher.

2887
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:23,760
Good morning, Mrs. Harper.

2888
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:31,320
I suppose that my Tom stayed with Fred or
Joe last night without telling me.

2889
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:34,481
And now he is afraid to come to church.”

2890
02:35:34,481 --> 02:35:36,221
Mrs. Thatcher seemed more ill than before.

2891
02:35:36,221 --> 02:35:37,601
She moved her head, saying no.

2892
02:35:37,601 --> 02:35:40,290
“He did not stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper.

2893
02:35:40,290 --> 02:35:43,320
Her face showed surprise and a little fear.

2894
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:45,730
Aunt Polly also showed fear.

2895
02:35:45,730 --> 02:35:50,431
“Joe Harper,” she said, “have you seen
my Tom this morning?”

2896
02:35:50,431 --> 02:35:51,431
“No.”

2897
02:35:51,431 --> 02:35:53,471
“When did you see him last?”

2898
02:35:53,471 --> 02:35:55,641
But Joe could not remember.

2899
02:35:55,641 --> 02:35:59,100
People had stopped moving out of the church.

2900
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,370
The story traveled quickly among them.

2901
02:36:01,370 --> 02:36:02,490
Children were questioned.

2902
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:06,960
No child could remember seeing Becky and Tom
on the returning riverboat.

2903
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,440
It was dark then.

2904
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:10,610
No person had thought of counting the group.

2905
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:12,370
A young man now said that Tom and Becky might
be lost in the cave.

2906
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:13,370
Mrs. Thatcher closed her eyes tightly.

2907
02:36:13,370 --> 02:36:14,370
Aunt Polly began to weep.

2908
02:36:14,370 --> 02:36:15,370
Within five minutes bells were ringing and
all the people were gathering.

2909
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:16,370
What had happened at Mrs. Douglas’s house
was not important now.

2910
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:17,370
In half an hour two hundred men were going,
either by river or by road, toward the cave.

2911
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:18,370
Through the long afternoon the village seemed
dead.

2912
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:19,370
Many women went to visit Aunt Polly and Mrs.
Thatcher.

2913
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:22,400
They wept with them, and that was more help
than words.

2914
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:25,420
Through the long night the town waited for
news.

2915
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:27,131
But in the morning only this news came: “Send
more food and more lights.”

2916
02:36:27,131 --> 02:36:28,131
Mrs. Thatcher was almost ill, and Aunt Polly
also.

2917
02:36:28,131 --> 02:36:31,530
Old Mr. Jones came home from the cave at noon,
and discovered that Huck was sick.

2918
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:32,530
Mrs. Douglas came to care for him.

2919
02:36:32,530 --> 02:36:33,530
Other men began to return from the cave, but
the stronger men continued their hunt.

2920
02:36:33,530 --> 02:36:34,530
They visited the farther parts of the cave.

2921
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:35,530
They shouted, and they shot guns, but they
had no answer.

2922
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:36,530
Often a light would be seen far away, and
they would think that the children were found.

2923
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:37,530
But the light always belonged to another of
the hunters.

2924
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:40,171
The names “Becky” and “Tom” were found
marked on a rock, and the string that had

2925
02:36:40,171 --> 02:36:41,311
tied Becky’s hair was found.

2926
02:36:41,311 --> 02:36:43,101
Three days and nights passed.

2927
02:36:43,101 --> 02:36:45,021
Huck asked about Tom Sawyer.

2928
02:36:45,021 --> 02:36:46,950
Mrs. Douglas said, “Quiet, child.

2929
02:36:46,950 --> 02:36:48,210
You must not talk.

2930
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:49,210
You are very, very sick.”

2931
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:50,210
She began to weep.

2932
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:51,360
There were not many now with enough hope or
strength to continue hunting for Tom Sawyer.

2933
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:52,360
Lost in the Cave—Found But Not Saved

2934
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,730
Tom and Becky had started through the branching
cave with the other children.

2935
02:36:53,730 --> 02:36:55,551
Then they had had enough of the games with
the others.

2936
02:36:55,551 --> 02:37:00,160
They had walked farther, talking, and reading
the writing on the walls.

2937
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:01,280
People had put their names there.

2938
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:03,260
Tom and Becky also put their names on the
wall.

2939
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:10,665
They came to a place where a small stream
of water fell over the rocks.

2940
02:37:10,665 --> 02:37:13,381
Tom went behind the waterfall, to let his
light shine through for Becky’s pleasure.

2941
02:37:13,381 --> 02:37:16,101
Behind this waterfall Tom found an opening
leading down, and he wanted to discover where

2942
02:37:16,101 --> 02:37:17,300
this branch of the cave went.

2943
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:19,405
He made a mark on the wall to guide their
return, and started down with Becky following.

2944
02:37:19,405 --> 02:37:20,405
They continued farther and farther, making
marks where they turned into a new branch,

2945
02:37:20,405 --> 02:37:26,141
and discovering many wonderful new parts of
the cave.

2946
02:37:26,141 --> 02:37:34,511
One great room was full of hundreds of bats,
which were hanging, asleep, on the walls.

2947
02:37:34,511 --> 02:37:41,300
When the children entered, the bats came flying
at the lights, and the children ran.

2948
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:43,150
They came to a dark lake, and sat down at
the edge.

2949
02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:51,910
Now, for the first time, they felt the deep
quiet of the place.

2950
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:57,271
Becky said, “It is a very long time since
I heard the others.”

2951
02:37:57,271 --> 02:37:58,271
“Becky, we are far below them, and far north,
or south, or east, or west.

2952
02:37:58,271 --> 02:37:59,271
We can’t hear them here.”

2953
02:37:59,271 --> 02:38:00,271
Becky was afraid.

2954
02:38:00,271 --> 02:38:01,271
“We should return.

2955
02:38:01,271 --> 02:38:02,271
Can you find the way, Tom?”

2956
02:38:02,271 --> 02:38:03,271
“I think that I can.

2957
02:38:03,271 --> 02:38:04,271
But there are those bats.

2958
02:38:04,271 --> 02:38:05,271
A different way would be better.”

2959
02:38:05,271 --> 02:38:06,271
“We must not get lost.

2960
02:38:06,271 --> 02:38:07,271
It would be fearful!”

2961
02:38:07,271 --> 02:38:08,271
They started.

2962
02:38:08,271 --> 02:38:09,271
But every turn now seemed strange.

2963
02:38:09,271 --> 02:38:10,271
Becky’s tears began to fall.

2964
02:38:10,271 --> 02:38:11,271
They stopped.

2965
02:38:11,271 --> 02:38:12,271
Tom shouted.

2966
02:38:12,271 --> 02:38:14,460
The answer was a deep quiet.

2967
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:24,771
It increased Becky’s fear, and Tom began
now to feel afraid.

2968
02:38:24,771 --> 02:38:31,141
Becky said, “We must return to the lake
and then go through the room full of bats.

2969
02:38:31,141 --> 02:38:32,141
It would be better than being lost.”

2970
02:38:32,141 --> 02:38:33,141
But Tom said, “Becky, I have been a fool!”

2971
02:38:33,141 --> 02:38:34,141
He had not remembered to make any marks.

2972
02:38:34,141 --> 02:38:35,141
He had not expected to return to the lake.

2973
02:38:35,141 --> 02:38:36,141
“Tom, Tom, we are lost!

2974
02:38:36,141 --> 02:38:37,141
We are lost!

2975
02:38:37,141 --> 02:38:38,141
We never can get out of this fearful place!

2976
02:38:38,141 --> 02:38:39,141
Oh, why did we leave the others?”

2977
02:38:39,141 --> 02:38:40,141
She dropped to the ground and wept so loudly
that Tom feared that she might die.

2978
02:38:40,141 --> 02:38:42,010
He sat down beside her and put his arms around
her.

2979
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:43,120
He said that he was sorry, that he should
never have brought her so far into the cave.

2980
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:45,580
Then she said that she also had been wrong;
they had both been wrong to come so far.

2981
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:46,580
They started to walk again.

2982
02:38:46,580 --> 02:38:47,580
Each had a light.

2983
02:38:47,580 --> 02:38:48,580
Now they decided to use only one light, and
to save the other.

2984
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:49,580
They walked until they could go no farther
without resting.

2985
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:50,580
They talked of home, and their friends, and
their beds, and they talked of sunlight.

2986
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:51,580
Becky’s tears started again.

2987
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:52,580
And then she was asleep.

2988
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,580
Tom watched her.

2989
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:54,580
Slowly her face grew peaceful, and then he
felt some peace.

2990
02:38:54,580 --> 02:38:55,580
She opened her eyes, laughing—but suddenly
the laugh ended.

2991
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:56,580
“Oh, I wish that I had never, never opened
my eyes again!

2992
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:57,580
Oh, Tom!

2993
02:38:57,580 --> 02:38:58,580
Do not look at me like that!

2994
02:38:58,580 --> 02:38:59,580
I shall not say that again.”

2995
02:38:59,580 --> 02:39:00,580
“We are going to find the way,” Tom said.

2996
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:01,580
“We are going to try.”

2997
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:02,580
They rose and started to walk, hand in hand
and without hope.

2998
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:03,580
Tom said that they must go quietly, and listen
for falling water.

2999
02:39:03,580 --> 02:39:04,580
They found it, and sat down to rest again.

3000
02:39:04,580 --> 02:39:05,580
Becky said:

3001
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:06,580
“Tom, I am very hungry!”

3002
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:07,580
Tom had saved a piece of the picnic cake.

3003
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:08,580
He took it from his pocket and divided it.

3004
02:39:08,580 --> 02:39:09,580
They had cold water to drink.

3005
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:10,580
After eating and drinking, Becky was ready
to move again.

3006
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,580
But Tom said, “Becky, I must tell you.

3007
02:39:11,580 --> 02:39:12,580
Our light is almost finished.

3008
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,580
We must stay here, where there is water.”

3009
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:14,580
Again Becky wept.

3010
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:15,580
Then a new thought came to her.

3011
02:39:15,580 --> 02:39:16,580
“Tom, they will hunt for us!

3012
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,580
Perhaps they are hunting for us now.

3013
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:18,580
When would they discover that we were not
with the others?

3014
02:39:18,580 --> 02:39:19,580
On the boat?”

3015
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:20,580
“It will be dark on the boat.

3016
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:21,580
But your mother will know that you have not
come home.”

3017
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:22,580
Now Tom learned that Mrs. Thatcher did not
expect Becky to return home that night.

3018
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:23,580
Then their last light failed, and darkness
was complete.

3019
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:24,580
Becky wept a long time in Tom’s arms.

3020
02:39:24,580 --> 02:39:25,580
Neither knew how long she wept.

3021
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:26,580
Then both opened their eyes in the darkness
and knew that they had been sleeping.

3022
02:39:26,580 --> 02:39:27,580
Again they did not know how much time had
passed.

3023
02:39:27,580 --> 02:39:28,580
Tom said that it might be Sunday.

3024
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:29,580
It might be a day later.

3025
02:39:29,580 --> 02:39:30,580
But Becky would not talk.

3026
02:39:30,580 --> 02:39:31,580
Her hopes were gone.

3027
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:32,580
The hours passed.

3028
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:33,580
They were hungry again.

3029
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:34,580
Tom had saved most of his share of the cake.

3030
02:39:34,580 --> 02:39:35,580
He divided it.

3031
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:36,580
Then they heard a sound like a distant shout.

3032
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:37,580
Tom answered.

3033
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:38,580
It came again.

3034
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:39,580
They started moving carefully toward it.

3035
02:39:39,580 --> 02:39:40,580
But they arrived at an edge of rock, where
the floor fell away.

3036
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:41,580
They could go no farther.

3037
02:39:41,580 --> 02:39:42,580
They listened.

3038
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:43,580
The distant shout was now more distant.

3039
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:44,580
And then they did not hear it, again.

3040
02:39:44,580 --> 02:39:45,580
They returned to the place where they had
water to drink.

3041
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:46,580
Time passed.

3042
02:39:46,580 --> 02:39:47,580
After sleeping again, when they opened their
eyes, they thought that another day must have

3043
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:48,580
passed.

3044
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:49,580
They were very hungry.

3045
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:50,580
Now Tom had a new idea.

3046
02:39:50,580 --> 02:39:51,580
The cave had many small branches near them.

3047
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:52,580
Tom decided to learn about them.

3048
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,580
That would be better than sitting and doing
nothing.

3049
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:54,580
He had some string in his pocket.

3050
02:39:54,580 --> 02:39:55,580
He tied an end of this to a rock near the
little waterfall.

3051
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:56,580
Then he and Becky started to walk carefully
away.

3052
02:39:56,580 --> 02:39:57,580
They let the string fall behind them.

3053
02:39:57,580 --> 02:39:58,580
It would be a guide for their return.

3054
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,580
After twenty steps, they came to a hole in
the rock floor.

3055
02:39:59,580 --> 02:40:00,580
Tom went down on his knees and felt below.

3056
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:01,580
Then he put his hands and his head as far
as possible around the corner to look.

3057
02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:02,580
At that moment a human hand, holding a light,
appeared from behind a rock not far away!

3058
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:03,580
Tom shouted.

3059
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:04,580
At once a body followed the hand.

3060
02:40:04,580 --> 02:40:05,580
It was Indian Joe!

3061
02:40:05,580 --> 02:40:06,580
Tom could not move because of fear.

3062
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:07,580
He was deeply thankful to see Indian Joe run
away.

3063
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:08,580
He did not tell Becky what he had seen or
why he had shouted.

3064
02:40:08,580 --> 02:40:09,580
They returned to the waterfall.

3065
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,580
But after another long wait and another sleep,
Tom decided to try moving again.

3066
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:11,580
They were very hungry now.

3067
02:40:11,580 --> 02:40:12,580
He thought that perhaps a week had passed.

3068
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:13,580
Becky was not strong enough to go with him.

3069
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:14,580
She asked him to return often.

3070
02:40:14,580 --> 02:40:15,580
She also asked him to return when all hope
was gone, and to hold her hand until she died.

3071
02:40:15,580 --> 02:40:16,580
Tom promised.

3072
02:40:16,580 --> 02:40:17,580
He kissed her.

3073
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:18,580
Then, with the string in his hand, he started
on his hands and knees through one of the

3074
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,580
openings in the rock.

3075
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:20,580
He was sick with fear and he had no hope.

3076
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,580
Tom Tells the Story of Their Escape

3077
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:22,580
Sunday and two more days had passed.

3078
02:40:22,580 --> 02:40:23,580
Few of the men continued their hunt in the
cave.

3079
02:40:23,580 --> 02:40:24,580
Most of the people believed that the children
could never be found.

3080
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:25,580
Mrs. Thatcher was very ill.

3081
02:40:25,580 --> 02:40:26,580
Aunt Polly’s hair had changed from gray
to white.

3082
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:27,580
Then, in the middle of the night the village
bells began to ring.

3083
02:40:27,580 --> 02:40:28,580
In a moment the streets were filled with people
shouting, “They are found!

3084
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:29,580
They are found!”

3085
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:30,580
All moved toward the river and met the children
as they were carried home.

3086
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:31,580
Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete.

3087
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:32,580
Mrs. Thatcher’s happiness would be complete
when the news reached her husband.

3088
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:33,580
He was yet in the cave, continuing the hunt.

3089
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:34,580
Tom lay on a bed telling the story of his
wonderful adventures.

3090
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:35,580
He had gone in one direction as far as the
length of the string.

3091
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:36,580
Then he had tried another opening.

3092
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:37,580
Then he had tried a third.

3093
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:38,580
He was ready to try another when he saw a
distant light.

3094
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:39,580
He thought that it was daylight.

3095
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:40,580
He dropped the string and ran toward it, and
put his head out through a small hole.

3096
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:41,580
And there was the great river on which the
boat had brought them to the picnic!

3097
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:42,580
He told how he then returned for Becky.

3098
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:43,580
She did not believe him.

3099
02:40:43,580 --> 02:40:44,580
She told him to let her die.

3100
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:45,580
But after a while she went with him.

3101
02:40:45,580 --> 02:40:46,580
When she saw the daylight, she almost died
of joy.

3102
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:47,580
He told how he got himself through the hole
and then helped her.

3103
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:48,580
They saw some men in a boat, and shouted.

3104
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:49,580
At first the men did not believe their wild
story.

3105
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:50,580
“Because,” the men said, “you are five
miles south of the door of the cave.”

3106
02:40:50,580 --> 02:40:51,580
But they believed the children after a while
and took them to a house where they were given

3107
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:52,580
food and allowed to rest before being taken
home.

3108
02:40:52,580 --> 02:40:53,580
It was several days before Tom and Becky were
strong again.

3109
02:40:53,580 --> 02:40:54,580
Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and went
to visit him.

3110
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:55,580
Mrs. Douglas would not let Tom talk about
his adventures because Huck was not strong

3111
02:40:55,580 --> 02:40:56,580
enough to listen.

3112
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:57,580
Also, she would not let the boys talk about
what had happened at her house on Cardiff

3113
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:58,580
Hill.

3114
02:40:58,580 --> 02:40:59,580
Tom learned about that at home.

3115
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:00,580
He heard, also, that “the other man” who
had been with Indian Joe had been found in

3116
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:01,580
the river.

3117
02:41:01,580 --> 02:41:02,580
He had drowned while trying to escape.

3118
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:03,580
About two weeks later, Tom visited Becky at
home.

3119
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:04,580
Judge Thatcher and some friends were there.

3120
02:41:04,580 --> 02:41:05,580
They asked Tom if he wished to go into the
cave again.

3121
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:06,580
Tom said yes.

3122
02:41:06,580 --> 02:41:07,580
“Others might wish to go, also,” the Judge
said.

3123
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:08,580
“But I had that door covered with iron.

3124
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:09,580
And it is closed.

3125
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,580
It can’t be opened.

3126
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:11,580
No person will get lost in that cave again.”

3127
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:12,580
“Oh, Judge,” Tom said, “Indian Joe is
in the cave!”

3128
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:13,580
What Happened to Indian Joe — A Return to
the Cave

3129
02:41:13,580 --> 02:41:14,580
The news spread.

3130
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,580
In a few minutes men were in boats on their
way to the cave.

3131
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:16,580
Tom was in the boat with Judge Thatcher.

3132
02:41:16,580 --> 02:41:17,580
When the door was opened, their eyes saw a
sad sight.

3133
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:18,580
Indian Joe was on the ground, dead.

3134
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:19,580
Tom’s experience in the cave made him understand
Indian Joe’s sufferings.

3135
02:41:19,580 --> 02:41:20,580
But a heavy weight of fear had been lifted
from Tom’s heart.

3136
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:21,580
The next morning, Tom and Huck had an important
talk.

3137
02:41:21,580 --> 02:41:22,580
Now Huck told Tom about following Indian Joe
up the hill to Mrs. Douglas’s house.

3138
02:41:22,580 --> 02:41:23,580
This part of the story was new to Tom.

3139
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:24,580
“And Indian Joe came from Number Two in
that public house,” Huck said.

3140
02:41:24,580 --> 02:41:25,580
“And now we shall never know any more about
that box of money.”

3141
02:41:25,580 --> 02:41:26,580
“Huck,” Tom said, “that money was never
in Number Two.

3142
02:41:26,580 --> 02:41:27,580
Huck, it is in the cave!”

3143
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:28,580
“Say that again, Tom.”

3144
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:29,580
“The money is in the cave.”

3145
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:30,580
“Tom, is this true?”

3146
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:31,580
“It is true, Huck.

3147
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:32,580
Will you go there with me and help to bring
it out?”

3148
02:41:32,580 --> 02:41:33,580
“I will if we can go into the cave and not
get lost.”

3149
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:34,580
“Are you strong enough?”

3150
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:35,580
Tom asked.

3151
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:36,580
“I can’t walk more than a mile, Tom.”

3152
02:41:36,580 --> 02:41:37,580
“It is five miles, Huck, for any other person.

3153
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:38,580
But I know a shorter way.

3154
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:39,580
I will take you there in a boat.

3155
02:41:39,580 --> 02:41:40,580
It will be easy for you.”

3156
02:41:40,580 --> 02:41:41,580
“I want to start now, Tom.”

3157
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:42,580
Tom agreed.

3158
02:41:42,580 --> 02:41:43,580
“We want some bread and meat, and our tobacco,
and two bags, and some string, and some lights.”

3159
02:41:43,580 --> 02:41:44,580
They took a friend’s boat, and about noon
the boys started their journey.

3160
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:45,580
Tom knew where to stop.

3161
02:41:45,580 --> 02:41:46,580
They pulled the boat up on the shore.

3162
02:41:46,580 --> 02:41:47,580
“Huck, the hole is near.

3163
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:48,580
Try to find it.”

3164
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:49,580
Huck tried and found nothing.

3165
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:50,580
Then Tom proudly took him among some trees
and said:

3166
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:51,580
“Here it is!”

3167
02:41:51,580 --> 02:41:52,580
The boys entered the hole.

3168
02:41:52,580 --> 02:41:53,580
Tom was leading.

3169
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:54,580
They tied their string to a rock to guide
their return.

3170
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:55,580
A few steps took them to the little waterfall,
and Tom felt his whole body shaking.

3171
02:41:55,580 --> 02:41:56,580
He told Huck that this was where he and Becky
had been when they were lost.

3172
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:57,580
The boys were very quiet now.

3173
02:41:57,580 --> 02:41:58,580
The stillness and the darkness were heavy
on their hearts.

3174
02:41:58,580 --> 02:41:59,580
They continued walking and soon they came
to the place where the floor seemed to end.

3175
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:00,580
With the light they could see that they were
on a hill leading to another rock floor below.

3176
02:42:00,580 --> 02:42:01,580
Tom said:

3177
02:42:01,580 --> 02:42:02,580
“Now I will show you something, Huck.”

3178
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:03,580
He held his light high.

3179
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:04,580
“Look as far as you can around the corner.

3180
02:42:04,580 --> 02:42:05,580
Do you see that?

3181
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:06,580
On the big rock?”

3182
02:42:06,580 --> 02:42:07,580
“Tom, it is a cross!”

3183
02:42:07,580 --> 02:42:08,580
“That is where I saw Indian Joe, Huck.

3184
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:09,580
And where is Number Two?

3185
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:10,580
Remember what he said?

3186
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:11,580
‘Under the cross.’

3187
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,580
”

3188
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:13,580
Huck said in a shaking voice, “Tom, I want
to go away from here.”

3189
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:14,580
“What!

3190
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,580
And leave the money?”

3191
02:42:15,580 --> 02:42:16,580
“Yes.

3192
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:17,580
Leave it.

3193
02:42:17,580 --> 02:42:18,580
Indian Joe’s spirit is there.”

3194
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:19,580
“No, Huck.

3195
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:20,580
His spirit is near the door, where he died.

3196
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:21,580
That is five miles away.”

3197
02:42:21,580 --> 02:42:22,580
“No, Tom.

3198
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:23,580
It would guard the money.

3199
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,580
I know about spirits, and you do also.”

3200
02:42:24,580 --> 02:42:25,580
Tom began to think that Huck was right.

3201
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:26,580
But then he had a different thought.

3202
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:27,580
“Huck, his spirit would not be near a cross.”

3203
02:42:27,580 --> 02:42:28,580
Huck agreed.

3204
02:42:28,580 --> 02:42:29,580
“Tom, I did not think of that.

3205
02:42:29,580 --> 02:42:30,580
But it is true.

3206
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:31,580
We must go down there and find the box.”

3207
02:42:31,580 --> 02:42:32,580
It was not easy to go down the hill of rock
to the floor below.

3208
02:42:32,580 --> 02:42:33,580
Tom went first, and Huck followed.

3209
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:34,580
Near the bottom of the great rock, the boys
found where some person had been eating and

3210
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:35,580
sleeping.

3211
02:42:35,580 --> 02:42:36,580
But they found no money.

3212
02:42:36,580 --> 02:42:37,580
Then Tom took his knife and used it to turn
over the earth behind the great rock.

3213
02:42:37,580 --> 02:42:38,580
The knife touched wood.

3214
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:39,580
“Huck!

3215
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:40,580
Do you hear that?”

3216
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:41,580
They pulled away some stones and some old
boards.

3217
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:42,580
Behind these there was an opening under the
rock.

3218
02:42:42,580 --> 02:42:43,580
With his light, Tom went down.

3219
02:42:43,580 --> 02:42:44,580
Huck followed.

3220
02:42:44,580 --> 02:42:45,580
Tom went around a corner and shouted:

3221
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:46,580
“Huck, look there!”

3222
02:42:46,580 --> 02:42:47,580
It was the box of money.

3223
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:48,580
There were also two guns.

3224
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:49,580
“We have it!” said Huck, putting his hands
among the pieces of gold.

3225
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:50,580
“We are rich, Tom!”

3226
02:42:50,580 --> 02:42:51,580
“Huck, I was always sure that we would get
it.

3227
02:42:51,580 --> 02:42:52,580
And we have it.

3228
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:53,580
Can I lift the box?”

3229
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:54,580
He could lift it, but he could not carry it.

3230
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:55,580
They put the money in their two bags, and
carried it up from the hole under the rock.

3231
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:56,580
“Now we want the guns,” said Huck.

3232
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:57,580
“No, Huck.

3233
02:42:57,580 --> 02:42:58,580
Leave them there.

3234
02:42:58,580 --> 02:42:59,580
We will return and use them some other time.

3235
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:00,580
I think it is late.

3236
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:01,580
And I am hungry.

3237
02:43:01,580 --> 02:43:02,580
We can eat and smoke outside, in the boat.”

3238
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:03,580
After eating and smoking, they returned up
the river.

3239
02:43:03,580 --> 02:43:04,580
It was dark when they arrived at the edge
of the village.

3240
02:43:04,580 --> 02:43:05,580
“Huck,” said Tom, “we will take the
money to Mrs. Douglas’s house.

3241
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:06,580
I know a place near there to leave it tonight.

3242
02:43:06,580 --> 02:43:07,580
Tomorrow morning we can count it and divide
it.

3243
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:08,580
And then we can find a place in the forest
where it will be safe.

3244
02:43:08,580 --> 02:43:09,580
You wait here now and watch it.

3245
02:43:09,580 --> 02:43:10,580
I am going to get Benny Taylor’s little
wagon.”

3246
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:11,580
He soon returned with the wagon.

3247
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:12,580
They put the bags of money in the wagon and
started toward Cardiff Hill.

3248
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:13,580
Near Mr. Jones’s house they stopped to rest.

3249
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:14,580
Mr. Jones came out.

3250
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:15,580
“Who is there?” he said.

3251
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:16,580
“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”

3252
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:17,580
“Come with me, boys.

3253
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:18,580
They are all waiting for you.

3254
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:19,580
Let me pull your wagon.

3255
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:20,580
It is very heavy!

3256
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:21,580
What do you have in it?

3257
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:22,580
Nothing of value, I am sure of that.

3258
02:43:22,580 --> 02:43:23,580
Boys will always work for things of no worth.

3259
02:43:23,580 --> 02:43:24,580
Hurry now.”

3260
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:25,580
The boys wanted to know why they should hurry.

3261
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:26,580
“You will learn when you arrive.”

3262
02:43:26,580 --> 02:43:27,580
Soon they were entering Mrs. Douglas’s house,
leaving the wagon near the door.

3263
02:43:27,580 --> 02:43:28,580
All the important people of the village were
there.

3264
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:29,580
The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, Aunt
Polly, Sid, Mary, and many more.

3265
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:30,580
All were dressed in their best clothes.

3266
02:43:30,580 --> 02:43:31,580
Tom and Huck were covered with earth from
the cave.

3267
02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:32,580
Aunt Polly’s face was red when she saw Tom’s
face and clothes.

3268
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:33,580
Mrs. Douglas took the boys to a bedroom and
said:

3269
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:34,580
“Wash and dress now.

3270
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:35,580
Here are new clothes for both of you.

3271
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:36,580
Come and join the others when you are ready.”

3272
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:37,580
Mr. Jones’s Surprise Fails

3273
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:38,580
Huck said, “Tom, we can run away.

3274
02:43:38,580 --> 02:43:39,580
We can go through the window.”

3275
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:40,580
“Why do you want to run away?”

3276
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:41,580
“I can’t join that crowd, Tom.”

3277
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:42,580
“Oh, that is nothing to be afraid of!

3278
02:43:42,580 --> 02:43:43,580
I will take care of you.”

3279
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:44,580
Sid appeared.

3280
02:43:44,580 --> 02:43:45,580
“Sid, why are all these people here?”

3281
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:46,580
“Old Mr. Jones has a surprise.

3282
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:47,580
But it won’t surprise many people.

3283
02:43:47,580 --> 02:43:48,580
Most of us know it already.”

3284
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:49,580
“What is the surprise, Sid?”

3285
02:43:49,580 --> 02:43:50,580
“It is about Huck following Indian Joe and
the other man to this house.

3286
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:51,580
But it won’t be a surprise.

3287
02:43:51,580 --> 02:43:52,580
You will see.”

3288
02:43:52,580 --> 02:43:53,580
He laughed.

3289
02:43:53,580 --> 02:43:54,580
“Some person told about it.”

3290
02:43:54,580 --> 02:43:55,580
Tom said, “You told.

3291
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:56,580
There is only one person in this town who
would destroy a good surprise.

3292
02:43:56,580 --> 02:43:57,580
You!

3293
02:43:57,580 --> 02:43:58,580
Now go away!

3294
02:43:58,580 --> 02:43:59,580
Or I will throw you out of this room!”

3295
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:00,580
Some minutes later Huck and Tom were eating
at a big table with the others.

3296
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:01,580
Then Mr. Jones stood up to speak.

3297
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:02,580
He told the story about Huck.

3298
02:44:02,580 --> 02:44:03,580
It was true that it did not seem much like
a surprise.

3299
02:44:03,580 --> 02:44:04,580
But people tried to seem surprised.

3300
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:05,580
Mrs. Douglas thanked Huck again and again.

3301
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:06,580
She said that she would give Huck a room in
her house, and send him to school and that

3302
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:07,580
later she would give him money to start a
business.

3303
02:44:07,580 --> 02:44:08,580
Tom said, “Huck won’t need it.

3304
02:44:08,580 --> 02:44:09,580
He is rich.”

3305
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:10,580
People tried not to laugh.

3306
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:11,580
Tom said, “Huck has money.

3307
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:12,580
Perhaps you do not believe it, but he has.

3308
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:13,580
I can show you.”

3309
02:44:13,580 --> 02:44:14,580
He ran outside.

3310
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:15,580
“What is Tom doing now?” said Aunt Polly.

3311
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:16,580
“I never can understand that boy.”

3312
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:17,580
Tom entered, carrying the heavy bags.

3313
02:44:17,580 --> 02:44:18,580
He opened them and let the yellow gold fall
out on the table.

3314
02:44:18,580 --> 02:44:19,580
“What did I tell you?” he said.

3315
02:44:19,580 --> 02:44:20,580
“Half is Huck’s and half is mine.”

3316
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:21,580
All looked.

3317
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:22,580
None could speak for a moment.

3318
02:44:22,580 --> 02:44:23,580
Then they asked Tom to explain.

3319
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:24,580
It was a long story, but it was full of interest.

3320
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:25,580
When Tom finished, Mr. Jones said, “I planned
a surprise for this evening.

3321
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:26,580
But this surprise makes mine seem very small.”

3322
02:44:26,580 --> 02:44:27,580
The money was counted.

3323
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:28,580
There was more than twelve thousand dollars.

3324
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:29,580
Some of the village people owned land and
were much richer than Tom and Huck.

3325
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:30,580
But none had ever before seen so much money
at one time.

3326
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:31,580
New Adventures Planned

3327
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:32,580
Tom’s and Huck’s money was a great wonder
in the poor little village.

3328
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:33,580
The reader may be sure of that.

3329
02:44:33,580 --> 02:44:34,580
It was not easy to believe that the money
was real.

3330
02:44:34,580 --> 02:44:35,580
People talked and talked about it.

3331
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:36,580
People went hunting for more money.

3332
02:44:36,580 --> 02:44:37,580
Boys went, and men went, also.

3333
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:38,580
They hunted in every old, lonely house.

3334
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:39,580
All watched Tom and Huck and listened to them.

3335
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:40,580
Every word they spoke had become important.

3336
02:44:40,580 --> 02:44:41,580
The village newspaper had a story about them.

3337
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:42,580
Mrs. Douglas put Huck’s money in a bank.

3338
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:43,580
Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom’s.

3339
02:44:43,580 --> 02:44:44,580
Each boy had money to spend now.

3340
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:45,580
He had almost a dollar for every day of the
year.

3341
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:46,580
In those days, a dollar and a quarter a week
was enough to buy a boy’s food and clothes,

3342
02:44:46,580 --> 02:44:47,580
and to pay for his schooling.

3343
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:48,580
Judge Thatcher had a good opinion of Tom.

3344
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:49,580
He said that only a very wise boy could have
brought Becky out of the cave safely.

3345
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:50,580
He expected Tom to become a great man.

3346
02:44:50,580 --> 02:44:51,580
Huck Finn’s life had changed.

3347
02:44:51,580 --> 02:44:52,580
His sufferings were almost too great for him.

3348
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:53,580
Mrs. Douglas had taken him to her home.

3349
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:54,580
She kept him clean.

3350
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:55,580
He must sleep every night in a clean bed.

3351
02:44:55,580 --> 02:44:56,580
He must eat like a gentleman.

3352
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:57,580
He must go to church.

3353
02:44:57,580 --> 02:44:58,580
He suffered for three weeks, and then the
next day he was gone.

3354
02:44:58,580 --> 02:44:59,580
Mrs. Douglas and all the people in the village
tried to find him.

3355
02:44:59,580 --> 02:45:00,580
They were afraid that he had drowned in the
river.

3356
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:01,580
Early on the third morning Tom Sawyer went
to an old building outside the village.

3357
02:45:01,580 --> 02:45:02,580
He found Huck.

3358
02:45:02,580 --> 02:45:03,580
Huck had been sleeping behind the building.

3359
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:04,580
He was lying there now, happily smoking.

3360
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:05,580
He was covered with dust.

3361
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:06,580
His hair was wild.

3362
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:07,580
He was wearing his old clothes.

3363
02:45:07,580 --> 02:45:08,580
Tom asked him to go home to Mrs. Douglas.

3364
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:09,580
Huck’s face became sad.

3365
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:10,580
He said, “Do not talk about it, Tom.

3366
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:11,580
I tried it.

3367
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:12,580
It is not for me.

3368
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:13,580
She is good to me, and friendly.

3369
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:14,580
But I can’t live with her.

3370
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:15,580
I must get up at the same time every morning.

3371
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:16,580
I must wash.

3372
02:45:16,580 --> 02:45:17,580
I must sleep in a bed.

3373
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:18,580
I must wear those good clothes.

3374
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:19,580
I can’t move in those clothes.

3375
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:20,580
I can’t sit down, I can’t lie down, I
can’t roll on the ground in them.

3376
02:45:20,580 --> 02:45:21,580
I must go to church.

3377
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:22,580
I must wear shoes on Sunday.”

3378
02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:23,580
“We all live like that, Huck.”

3379
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:24,580
“Tom, I am different.

3380
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:25,580
I can’t live like that.

3381
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:26,580
It is easy to get food.

3382
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:27,580
Mrs. Douglas won’t let me smoke.

3383
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:28,580
And she prays all the time.

3384
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:29,580
I had to leave, Tom, or I would die.

3385
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:30,580
And when school begins, I would have to go
to school.

3386
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:31,580
“Tom, being rich is no good.

3387
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:32,580
I wish I was dead all the time.

3388
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:33,580
I like these old clothes.

3389
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:34,580
I like this place to sleep.

3390
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:35,580
This is what I want.

3391
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:36,580
Tom, I give you my share of the money.

3392
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:37,580
You can give me ten cents when I need it.

3393
02:45:37,580 --> 02:45:38,580
But not often.

3394
02:45:38,580 --> 02:45:39,580
I do not like what is easy to get.

3395
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:40,580
And you go now and explain to Mrs. Douglas.”

3396
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:41,580
“Oh, Huck, you know that I can’t do that.

3397
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:42,580
And if you try longer, you will like it.”

3398
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:43,580
“Like it!

3399
02:45:43,580 --> 02:45:44,580
Yes, I will like it as I would like a burning
coal if I sat on it.

3400
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,580
No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t
live in a house.

3401
02:45:45,580 --> 02:45:46,580
I like the forest, and the river, and a place
like this for sleeping.

3402
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:47,580
But now we are rich and all our games like
being pirates are destroyed.”

3403
02:45:47,580 --> 02:45:48,580
“Listen, Huck.

3404
02:45:48,580 --> 02:45:49,580
Being rich won’t change that.”

3405
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:50,580
“Is that true, Tom?”

3406
02:45:50,580 --> 02:45:51,580
“It is true.

3407
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:52,580
But if you want to join me and the other boys,
and belong to my club, you must live like

3408
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:53,580
us.”

3409
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:54,580
“Tom, is that friendly?”

3410
02:45:54,580 --> 02:45:55,580
“I want you to join us, Huck.

3411
02:45:55,580 --> 02:45:56,580
But all the boys who join Tom Sawyer’s Club
must have good characters.”

3412
02:45:56,580 --> 02:45:57,580
Huck was quiet.

3413
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:58,580
There was a battle in his mind.

3414
02:45:58,580 --> 02:45:59,580
After a while he said, “I will return to
Mrs. Douglas for a month.

3415
02:45:59,580 --> 02:46:00,580
I will try, if you will let me belong to Tom
Sawyer’s Club.”

3416
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:01,580
“I agree, Huck.

3417
02:46:01,580 --> 02:46:02,580
Come with me now.

3418
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:03,580
And I promise to ask Mrs. Douglas to change
a little, Huck.”

3419
02:46:03,580 --> 02:46:04,580
“Will you, Tom?

3420
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:05,580
That is good.

3421
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:06,580
When will you start your club?”

3422
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:07,580
“Oh, soon.

3423
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:08,580
This evening, perhaps, we can have the first
meeting.”

3424
02:46:08,580 --> 02:46:09,580
“What will we do at the meeting?”

3425
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:10,580
“We will promise always to help each other,
and promise never to tell what we plan to

3426
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:11,580
do, and promise to kill any person who hurts
one of us.”

3427
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,580
“I like that, Tom.

3428
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:13,580
I like it.”

3429
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:14,580
“And we must make those promises in the
middle of the night, in a lonely place.

3430
02:46:14,580 --> 02:46:15,580
And sign with blood.”

3431
02:46:15,580 --> 02:46:16,580
“This is better than being a pirate, Tom.

3432
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:17,580
I will stay with Mrs. Douglas.

3433
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:18,580
And we will have adventures that will make
the whole village talk about us.

3434
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:19,580
And then Mrs. Douglas will be proud because
she took me into her home.”

3435
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:19,582
- THE END -
