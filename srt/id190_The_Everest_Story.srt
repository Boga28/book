00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,520
CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,040
The body - 1999

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,840
A group of five climbers move slowly 
across the north face of Everest.  

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,800
Suddenly, one of them sees something strange 
on the rocks below him. Something whiter than  

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,840
the snow. Carefully, he climbs down towards 
it. Then he calls his friends on his radio.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,440
'Come down here,' he says. 'Look at this.'

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,160
Coming closer, they see it is the dead body of a 
climber. The wind has blown some of the clothes  

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,880
from the body, and the skin is clean and white, 
like new stone. In the icy cold, it looks like the  

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:12,160
body of a man who died a few days ago. But the 
bits of clothes that are still on the body are  

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,400
old, brown and grey - nothing like the brightly 
coloured clothes that modern climbers wear.  

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,720
The body is lying face down. Above the head, the 
fingers of one hand are dug into the icy ground.  

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,480
One leg is broken in two places below the 
knee, and the other leg is lying over it.  

13
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
The body looks strong and healthy, they 
think, like the body of a runner or dancer.

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,040
The climbers photograph the body 
carefully. Then, very gently,  

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,040
they touch the dead man's clothes - the hobnail 
boots, the trousers and shirt made of wool.  

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,160
How little he was wearing, they 
think, on this icy cold mountain.  

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,280
'I walk out on the street in Seattle with more 
clothing than he had on,' one of them says.  

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,240
Yet here they are at 8,155 metres on Mount 
Everest, the highest mountain in the world.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
Who is this man? He can only be 
one of two people, they think.  

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:35,840
But which one? Then they find a name inside 
his shirt. 'George Leigh Mallory', it says.

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,080
But who is George Leigh Mallory? Why 
are these climbers so interested in him?  

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,840
How did he die, and what happened to him before 
he died? Where is his friend, Andrew Irvine?

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,320
And the most important question of 
all - was this man, George Mallory,  

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,840
the first man to reach the summit of Everest?
 
 

25
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,720
CHAPTER TWO

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,560
Dangers

27
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,160
The climbers do not stay long with the body,  

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,800
because Mount Everest is one of the most 
dangerous places in the world. There are  

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,720
many things that make it difficult to stay alive 
here. The most important of these is the height.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,240
The top of Everest is 8,850 metres above 
sea level. As you climb up the mountain,  

31
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,720
the air becomes thinner - 
it has less and less oxygen.  

32
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,640
Most people live less than 900 metres above 
sea level, where the air is full of oxygen.  

33
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,520
Above 2,000 metres the air is thinner, 
and people find it harder to breathe.  

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:12,080
At 4,000 metres it is harder still, and at 5,000 
metres most people begin to feel ill. They get  

35
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,720
headaches, feel tired, and breathe quickly all 
the time, like someone who has run a long way.

36
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,160
In 1921, when Mallory first went 
to Everest, no one had climbed  

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,560
a mountain higher than 7,500 metres, and 
many people did not think it was possible.  

38
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
'If climbers don't have enough oxygen, 
they'll be too tired to climb,'  

39
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,360
they said. And they won't be able to think 
clearly, either. So they will make stupid  

40
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,560
mistakes - forget to eat and drink, or talk to 
people who are not there. Perhaps they'll die.'

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,800
But the need for oxygen is not the only problem 
on Everest. There is also the weather. Almost  

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,680
every week there are winds of 100 or even 200 
kph (kilometres per hour). It is difficult to  

43
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,880
walk or even stand up in these winds. The wind 
can blow climbers off the edge of the mountain,  

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,240
thousands of metres to the valley below. 
Climbers sometimes sit in their tents for days,  

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,760
unable to sleep because of the noise, and 
afraid that the wind will blow their tents away.

46
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,560
And then there is the cold. Temperatures 
on Everest often fall below -20 degrees,  

47
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
but the wind makes that feel much colder.

48
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
But before anyone can climb 
Everest they have to get there.  

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Tibet in China is to the north of Everest, and 
Nepal is to the south, and until 1950, Nepal  

50
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,960
refused to let any foreign climbers enter their 
country. So the earliest climbers, like Mallory  

51
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:19,840
and Irvine, had to get to Everest from the north, 
through Tibet. And that was not easy at all.
 
 

52
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
CHAPTER THREE

53
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Through Tibet to Everest - 1921

54
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Until the early nineteenth 
century, nobody in the west knew  

55
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,320
about Mount Everest. People in Tibet knew, 
of course - they called it Chomolungma:  

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,160
'Goddess Mother of the World', and to people in 
Nepal it was Sagarmatha: 'Goddess of the Sky'.  

57
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,760
But no one in Tibet or Nepal had ever climbed 
the mountain - they thought that was a very  

58
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,520
strange idea. And no foreign person had 
ever been so far into the Himalayas.

59
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,160
But in the 1830s a British soldier called 
George Everest was making maps in north India.  

60
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,560
He made the first maps of the Himalayas, and 
measured the height of some of the mountains.  

61
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,840
But Everest finished his work in 
1843, and he never saw Chomolungma.  

62
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,160
The first British man to see the mountain 
was Everest's friend, Andrew Waugh. In 1852  

63
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,960
Radhanath Sikdhar, who worked for Waugh, said he 
had discovered the highest mountain in the world.  

64
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,760
It was measured carefully many times. Then 
in 1856 Waugh said that this was the highest  

65
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:00,960
mountain in the world. He gave it the name 
of his old friend, George Everest, in 1865.

66
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,840
But very few British people were able to enter 
Tibet or Nepal at that time. So it was not until  

67
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,720
1921 that the first British expedition went to 
see if it was possible to climb the mountain.  

68
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,840
There were nine British climbers on this 
expedition, and one of them was George Mallory.

69
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,240
To get to Everest, the climbers had to walk 
500 kilometres through Tibet. Their Tibetan  

70
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,840
porters carried everything they needed: food, 
tents, clothes, cameras, and climbing equipment.

71
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
It was a long, difficult 
journey which took a month.  

72
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,240
They were always climbing - at first 
through river valleys with tall trees,  

73
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,960
colourful flowers and birds - then onto 
a wide stony place where nothing grew.  

74
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,000
There was no sound except the wind, and 
all the time the air was becoming thinner.

75
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,720
The climbers walked past Tibetan villages high up 
on the sides of mountains, and came to Rongbuk,  

76
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:23,120
the highest monastery in the world, 4,800 metres 
above sea level. The monks in the monastery looked  

77
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,320
at the visitors in surprise, wondering why 
they wanted to climb the dangerous mountain.

78
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,720
The climbers decided that the best way 
to get onto the mountain was to go up  

79
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,560
the East Rongbuk Glacier. From there 
they planned to climb to the North Col,  

80
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
a small flat place on the north ridge of Everest.

81
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,840
By this time it was late in the year, 
and the winds were getting stronger.  

82
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,920
They had not planned to get to the summit 
this year, but only to look for a way up.  

83
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,880
But on 23 September 1921, Mallory, with 
two other climbers and three porters,  

84
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,520
climbed up the steep ice wall 
of the East Rongbuk Glacier.  

85
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,760
When they reached the snow ridge 
of the North Col the next day,  

86
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:29,840
they could see the summit, 1,800 metres above 
them. But at 7,000 metres it was difficult  

87
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,400
to breathe, and they moved slowly. And they 
could hardly stand up in the strong icy winds.

88
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,840
They would have to go down, 
and come back next year.
 
 

89
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,480
CHAPTER FOUR

90
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,840
The first attempt - 1922

91
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:09,440
In 1922 a larger expedition returned. They brought 
oxygen with them this time, but the equipment was  

92
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,680
very heavy, and it did not always work. Many of 
the climbers wanted to climb the mountain on their  

93
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,880
own, if possible, without help. So climbing with 
oxygen was not popular with most of the climbers.

94
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Four climbers set out on the first summit attempt 
- Mallory, Morshead, Norton, and Somervell.  

95
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:43,360
With five porters, they left Camp 4 on the North 
Col at 7.00 a.m. There was a terrible cold wind,  

96
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,720
and the climbers moved slowly, cutting steps in 
the snow for the porters behind them. They hoped  

97
00:11:50,720 --> 00:12:01,280
to reach 8,230 metres that day, but at 7,620 
metres they were too cold and tired to go on.  

98
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,840
They found a place for Camp 5 and the porters 
left their loads here and went back down.

99
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,560
The four men crawled into their two 
small tents to rest. But all night  

100
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,840
there was a high wind, and it was difficult 
to breathe or sleep. To get water to drink,  

101
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,640
they had to melt snow over a small 
cooker, which took a long time.

102
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,640
Next morning, Morshead was ill. So Mallory, 
Norton, and Somervell set out at 8.00 a.m.,  

103
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:47,120
leaving Morshead alone in the tent. They 
moved slowly, stopping after every few steps  

104
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,480
to rest and breathe. As they climbed, their 
hobnail boots slipped dangerously on the stones  

105
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,640
and rocks. In the thin air they felt tired, more 
tired than any of them had ever felt before.  

106
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:14,400
At 2.00 p.m. they reached 8,227 metres, but they 
were still about 600 metres below the summit.  

107
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,840
So they turned back, and 
helped Morshead down to Camp 3.

108
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,840
On the way down, they met three 
more of their climbers coming up.  

109
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,440
They were the Australian George Finch, a Gurkha 
called Tejbir Bura, and Geoffrey Bruce - a young  

110
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,520
man who had never climbed before. Unlike the 
first group, Finch and Bruce liked using oxygen.  

111
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:53,040
They made a new Camp 5 - 150 metres higher than 
Mallory's - but then they were caught in a storm  

112
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,720
and had to stay in their tent for two nights. 
On the third day Finch and Bruce went on,  

113
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:11,440
using their oxygen, to 8,323 metres. But here 
Bruce became exhausted and had to be helped down.

114
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,160
Because the oxygen had been so successful, 
Mallory, Somervell, and a third climber  

115
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,480
called Colin Crawford decided to make 
another attempt, this time with oxygen.  

116
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,960
But while they were climbing across a snow slope,  

117
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
there was a sudden avalanche. 
Everyone was buried under the snow.  

118
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,840
All the climbers and seven porters managed 
to climb out, but seven porters were killed.

119
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:57,840
It was clear that Everest had won - this time.
 
 

120
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,240
CHAPTER FIVE

121
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,640
Saving the porters - 1924

122
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,400
The British climbers returned in April 
1924. This time they planned to succeed.  

123
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Edward Norton was the chief 
climber in the group of twelve men,  

124
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,920
and they had 150 Tibetan porters, 
both men and women, to help them.  

125
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,640
From Base Camp the porters carried equipment up 
to Camps 1 and 2 on the Rongbuk and East Rongbuk  

126
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Glaciers. One woman carried her two-year-old 
child on top of an 18 kilogram load from  

127
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:54,480
5,300 metres to 6,000 metres. Then she carried 
her child back down, and offered to go up again!

128
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,600
The next part was harder. On a 
cold, stormy day, Mallory, Irvine  

129
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,560
and two other climbers set out with twenty porters 
to carry equipment from Base Camp to Camp 3,  

130
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,920
but the weather was terrible. A strong 
wind blew down off the mountain,  

131
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,680
straight into their faces. The ice on the 
glacier was as clear and hard as glass.  

132
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
There were not enough tents at Camp 2, 
so some of the porters slept outside.  

133
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,240
Next morning they went on to Camp 3, 
but here it was even colder than before.  

134
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,960
That night the temperature fell to -29 degrees. 
The strong icy wind blew into the tents  

135
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,800
all night, so everyone - inside 
the tents - was covered with snow.

136
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,880
The storm blew for two more days. Many 
of the porters lay in their tents, not  

137
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:15,280
caring about life or death. At last the storm 
ended and they all went down to Base Camp to rest.  

138
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,320
Three men were seriously ill; another 
had bad frostbite on both feet.

139
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:33,520
The porters were unhappy and afraid. 'The mountain 
is angry,' they said. 'It will kill us.' So  

140
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,480
on 15 May all the climbers and porters went down 
the valley to the Rongbuk Monastery, where the  

141
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:48,400
chief monk said prayers for them. Next day the 
wind had gone, and the sky was clear and blue.

142
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,040
The climbers returned to Camp 3. Then they started 
to climb up the steep ice wall to the North Col,  

143
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,200
to make Camp 4. And once again, things went wrong.

144
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,800
The ice was covered with new snow after the storm.  

145
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,760
There were many crevasses - deep holes in the 
ice - which were difficult to see under the snow.  

146
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:25,920
This was the place where seven porters had died 
in 1922. This time four people set out - Mallory,  

147
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:33,280
Norton, Odell, and Lakpa Tsering. They 
climbed carefully, cutting steps in the snow.  

148
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,320
They crossed several deep crevasses. Then, 
just below the North Col, they came to a steep  

149
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:51,280
slope about 100 metres high. It was a dangerous 
place. The slope was covered with new soft snow.  

150
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,120
At the foot of the slope was a wall of ice, 
falling hundreds of metres to the valley below.

151
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,760
Mallory climbed slowly up the slope, while 
Norton and Odell held him from below on a rope.  

152
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,560
After half an hour they reached the 
top, and found a place for Camp 4.

153
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
But all the climbers were tired.  

154
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,280
On the way down the snow suddenly collapsed 
under Mallory's feet and he fell into a crevasse.  

155
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:38,240
Only his ice axe, across the top of the crevasse, 
saved him. No one had seen him fall. He looked up,  

156
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:47,200
at the sky, then down, into the deep blue hole 
below him. One mistake here could mean death.  

157
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:56,320
Very slowly and carefully, he pulled his tired 
body up the ice wall and out onto the snow.

158
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:06,240
When the climbers got back to Camp 3 they 
were all exhausted. Their heads ached,  

159
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
and they coughed all night in the thin, cold air.

160
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:21,200
Next day, three more climbers - Somervell, Irvine, 
and Hazard - and twelve porters climbed the snow  

161
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,040
slope to Camp 4. Somervell and Irvine came 
down, leaving Hazard behind with the porters.  

162
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,640
That night it snowed heavily, and 
the temperature fell to -31 degrees.  

163
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,560
The exhausted porters shivered in their 
tents. All next day Norton, in Camp 3,  

164
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:58,400
waited for them to come down. At last, he saw them 
coming - black dots on the snow. But only eight  

165
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,760
porters and Hazard arrived at Camp 3. Four porters 
had turned back, afraid that they would fall.

166
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:15,680
So now four porters were alone at Camp 4. And 
more and more snow was falling, making the  

167
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,520
steep slope more dangerous than ever. Without 
help from the climbers, the porters would die.

168
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,400
All the climbers were tired and ill. 
Mallory and Somervell had bad throats  

169
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:41,680
and were coughing badly. It snowed heavily 
all night. But next morning Norton, Mallory,  

170
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:48,960
and Somervell climbed slowly up towards 
Camp 4. It was difficult, dangerous work.  

171
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,000
They reached the snow slope, and called out 
to the porters above them in words like these.

172
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,920
'Are you alive?' the climbers 
asked. 'Can you walk?'

173
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,160
'Yes sir,' a porter answered.  

174
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,640
'But we're afraid. It's too dangerous. 
If we slip, we'll fall, and die!'

175
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:25,840
'If you stay there, you'll die of cold,' Norton 
said. 'Wait there - we're coming to get you.'

176
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,160
Very carefully, Somervell climbed across the steep 
slope, towards the four porters. He had a rope  

177
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:40,720
round his waist. Mallory and Norton held 
the rope from below, to keep Somervell safe.  

178
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,040
But when he was five metres away from the 
porters, Somervell reached the end of the rope.

179
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:57,280
'What do I do now?' he thought. 'We have 
no more rope, and it will soon be dark.'

180
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,840
'Come across!' he called out to the porters. 
'It's not far. Carefully, one at a time.'

181
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,280
The first two porters reached Somervell safely. 
Then they climbed past him, holding the rope,  

182
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,400
towards Norton and Mallory. Somervell 
looked at the last two porters.

183
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,640
'Come on,' he said. 'It's not 
difficult. One at a time.'

184
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,880
But the porters were afraid, and both started 
together. A second later they slipped and  

185
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,760
fell. They slid past Somervell down the slope, 
towards the valley thousands of metres below.  

186
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,840
But then, a few metres from the 
edge of the slope, they stopped.

187
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
'Don't move,' Somervell said. 'Just wait for me.'

188
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,160
He drove his ice axe deep into the 
snow. He untied the rope from his waist,  

189
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,840
and passed it round the head of the ice axe. 
Then, holding his end of the rope with one hand,  

190
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,520
Somervell climbed down until he could 
just reach the men with his other hand.  

191
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,000
He pulled up the first man, then the second. They 
climbed along the rope to Mallory and Norton.  

192
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,320
Somervell tied the rope round his waist 
again, and climbed back after them.

193
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:42,080
Even now they were not safe. It was nearly dark, 
and a long way above Camp 3. One of the porters,  

194
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:51,520
Namgya, could not use his hands, because he had 
bad frostbite. But at last they reached Camp 3,  

195
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,600
where two more climbers, Noel and 
Odell, were waiting with warm food.

196
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,840
All the climbers were exhausted. Mallory 
and Somervell could not stop coughing,  

197
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,680
and Norton's feet hurt badly. Helping 
the four porters had made them very,  

198
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,280
very tired. And they were nowhere 
near the summit of Everest.

199
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:41,840
Slowly they went down to Camp 1. They needed 
time to rest, and to decide what to do next.
 
 

200
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,520
CHAPTER SIX

201
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,680
Somervell and Norton - 1924

202
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,040
Norton decided that two pairs of climbers 
would try to reach the summit, without oxygen.  

203
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,280
Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce would go first, and 
Norton and Somervell would follow the next day.  

204
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:18,080
The climbers would find a place for Camp 5 above 
7,600 metres, and for Camp 6 at 8,231 metres.  

205
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Odell and Irvine would go up to Camp 4, 
to help the climbers when they came down.

206
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,400
On 1 June Mallory and Bruce climbed 
up to Camp 4 with nine porters.  

207
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,760
The next day was clear and sunny, but above 
the North Col they met a terrible icy wind.  

208
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,560
It was difficult to stand, 
hardly possible to walk.  

209
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:58,800
Only five porters continued with Mallory and 
Bruce. At 7,600 metres, they found a place  

210
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:08,480
for two small tents on a steep slope - Camp 5. All 
that night they shivered in their sleeping bags,  

211
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,880
while the wind tried to blow their tents 
into the air. Next morning they were all ill.  

212
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,080
Only one porter was able to go on. 
Sadly, they decided to come down.

213
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:34,240
As they went down, they passed Norton and 
Somervell with four more porters, coming up.  

214
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,160
These men reached Camp 5, and 
spent a better night there.  

215
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,720
The wind was less strong, and they 
managed to cook, eat and sleep. It was  

216
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,680
very, very cold, and in the thin air, 
with no oxygen, it was difficult to move.  

217
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:04,320
But next morning, three porters - Napboo Yishay, 
Lhakpa Chedi, and Semchumbi - were ready to go on.

218
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,840
They climbed on, up to 8,170 metres - 
higher than any man had been before.  

219
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Here, at 1.30 p.m., they put 
up one tiny tent - Camp 6.  

220
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,400
Then the porters went down to the North Col, while 
Norton and Somervell got ready for the night.  

221
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,800
As it grew dark, they wondered: can a man 
sleep, without oxygen, at this height?

222
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:52,640
Yes! It was 'the best night since I left Camp 1,' 
Norton wrote. So at 6.45 next morning the two men  

223
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,920
set out for the summit. They climbed slowly, 
taking three or four breaths for every step.  

224
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,120
They stayed a little below the ridge, to keep out 
of the wind. But in the shadow of the mountain,  

225
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,720
out of the sun, it was very cold. Norton 
shivered all the time, and he was having  

226
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,840
trouble with his eyes. Somervell coughed a lot, 
and his bad throat made it difficult to breathe.

227
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,400
By midday they were at 8,536 metres.  

228
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:39,840
The view was wonderful - they were above the 
clouds, with a sea of mountains below them.

229
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:49,280
But Somervell was exhausted. His throat was 
worse; he could hardly breathe. So Norton  

230
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:57,680
went on alone. He was moving more and more 
slowly, on a steep slope like the roof of a house.  

231
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:08,720
There were large stones and soft snow under his 
feet; it was easy to fall. And below him - 2,743  

232
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:18,240
metres straight down, in the thin clear air 
- was the East Rongbuk Glacier and Camp 3.

233
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,840
He looked up. He was about 
275 metres below the summit,  

234
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:36,160
but they were vertical metres - metres measured 
up the mountain, not along it. But he was tired,  

235
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:45,280
and moving very slowly. And his eyes were getting 
worse. Sometimes he saw two ice axes in his hand,  

236
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:55,040
not one. He knew that it was possible. He could 
get to the summit - but he could not get back.

237
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Norton was nearer the summit than any 
man before him. But at 8,575 metres,  

238
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,240
he decided to turn back towards 
Somervell. It was the right thing to do.  

239
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:22,080
Halfway down to Camp 5, Somervell stopped. There 
was something in his throat - for nearly a minute  

240
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,720
he could not breathe at all. Then he coughed 
up a ball of blood, and could breathe again.

241
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,040
When they reached Camp 4, 
Norton could not see at all.
 
 

242
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,840
CHAPTER SEVEN

243
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,240
Mallory and Irvine - 1924

244
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,000
But to Norton's surprise, there were 
two more climbers at Camp 4 - Mallory  

245
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,320
and Irvine. Mallory had decided to try again 
- with oxygen this time. Irvine was young,  

246
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,320
and he had not climbed many mountains, but  

247
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,880
he understood the oxygen equipment better than 
anyone. So Mallory decided to climb with him.

248
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:30,960
On 6 June they set out for Camp 5. 
Eight porters carried food and oxygen.  

249
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,400
Next day they went on to Camp 6 with four porters.  

250
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,600
There, Mallory sent them back down with a note 
to Noel, who was filming the expedition:
 
 

251
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,160
Dear Noel,

252
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,560
We'll probably start early tomorrow 
(8th) in order to have clear weather.  

253
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
It won't be too early to start 
looking out for us either  

254
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,560
crossing the rock band under the 
pyramid or going up skyline at 8.00 p.m.

255
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,840
Yours ever, G. Mallory
 
 

256
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,760
Behind them, Odell climbed up to Camp 5 
with food to help them when they came down.  

257
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Mallory left a note for him too, 
asking him to wait at Camp 4 the next  

258
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,960
evening. The weather was fine, he said, 
but the oxygen was very heavy to carry.

259
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Odell was climbing alone, without oxygen. 
He spent the night at Camp 5 and then  

260
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:53,520
climbed up towards Camp 6. At 7,900 metres he 
found some very old rocks. Studying rocks was  

261
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:01,120
Odell's job, and the rocks that he found showed 
him that Everest had once been under the sea.  

262
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,720
At 12.50 p.m., the clouds cleared above him, 
and he could see the summit ridge of Everest.  

263
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:20,720
High on the ridge, he saw two tiny black dots 
moving on the snow. They climbed quickly,  

264
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,040
to the top of a rock step near the summit. 
Then the clouds came back and they disappeared.

265
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:39,440
It was Mallory and Irvine, climbing strongly 
towards the summit. But Odell thought they were a  

266
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:47,840
little late. Was there enough time for them to get 
to the summit and then down to Camp 6 that night?  

267
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,080
He climbed up to Camp 6 and left some food 
for them in the tent. Then he climbed higher,  

268
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,840
towards the summit, calling out 
for them. But no one answered.

269
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:10,880
He wondered what to do. He wanted to stay, but the 
tiny tent at Camp 6 was too small for three men.  

270
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,360
So, at 4.30 p.m., he went down. 
By 7.00 p.m. he was in Camp 4.

271
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,080
The next day was 9 June. Odell was 
worried. When he looked up the mountain,  

272
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,480
he could see the tents of Camps 5 and 6, 
but nothing - and nobody - was moving.  

273
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,840
So Odell, with two porters, 
climbed up again to Camp 5.

274
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
There was a strong wind all night. 
The porters shivered in their tent,  

275
00:35:52,160 --> 00:36:01,600
and next morning they refused to move. So 
Odell went on alone, up to Camp 6. But no  

276
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:11,840
one was there. The tent was closed, the food was 
still there. Mallory and Irvine had disappeared.

277
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:23,920
For two hours Odell climbed on, above Camp 6, 
towards the summit. What was he thinking? Mallory  

278
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:33,520
and Irvine were probably dead, but perhaps - 
just perhaps - one of them was still alive, badly  

279
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:41,440
injured up there. Perhaps he could see something, 
or find something, and return with some answers.

280
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:53,840
But he saw nothing, and found no bodies. Sadly, 
he turned back. At Camp 6, he went into the tent,  

281
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,640
and pulled out two black sleeping bags. He 
put them on the snow in the shape of a T.  

282
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,840
It was a message to the others, far 
below, that Mallory and Irvine were dead.

283
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,960
But what happened to them? Did they 
reach the summit before they died?  

284
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,840
Or did they turn back, like Norton 
and Somervell? No one knows.

285
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:31,520
When Odell last saw them it was already 12.50 in 
the afternoon. But they were moving quickly, he  

286
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,360
said. So perhaps they went on to the summit, and 
then were too tired to find Camp 6 before dark.  

287
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,720
Perhaps, in the darkness, one of them fell, 
and the other died trying to help him.  

288
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,400
Perhaps they both fell together. 
Or perhaps, with no more oxygen,  

289
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:03,840
they were just too cold and tired to move 
any more, and lay down in the snow to sleep.

290
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:17,840
It was seventy-five years before some 
of these questions were answered.
 
 

291
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,440
CHAPTER EIGHT

292
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,360
To the South Col -1953

293
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:37,120
After 1950 Western climbers could no longer 
enter Tibet, but they could enter Nepal.  

294
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:48,480
In 1951 a British expedition went to the southern 
side of Everest for the first time, and in 1952  

295
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:56,720
a Swiss climber called Raymond Lambert made an 
attempt on the summit with Tenzing Norgay. Tenzing  

296
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,560
was one of the Sherpa people of Nepal, who are 
excellent climbers and know the mountains well.  

297
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,360
Together Lambert and Tenzing 
almost reached the summit, but  

298
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,080
their oxygen equipment was not working well, and 
at the highest camp they had no sleeping bags. So  

299
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:31,840
at 8,597 metres - just a few metres higher than 
Norton had gone in 1924 - they turned back.

300
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:44,640
In 1953 John Hunt came to Kathmandu, the capital 
of Nepal, with a large British expedition. Tenzing  

301
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:53,200
Norgay joined them here, and the expedition 
set out for Thyangboche, a monastery south of  

302
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:03,040
Everest. The walk took seventeen days, and 350 
porters were needed to carry their equipment.  

303
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,800
In Thyangboche, they were joined by two New 
Zealand climbers - Edmund Hillary and George Lowe.

304
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,200
The climbers spent three weeks at Base 
Camp, getting used to the thin mountain air.  

305
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:29,200
They climbed smaller mountains of about 6,000 
metres, learning to use the oxygen equipment.  

306
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,320
John Hunt thought that Tenzing 
Norgay was stronger than anyone.

307
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:45,120
Their first problem was to find a way up 
the Khumbu Icefall onto the Khumbu Glacier.  

308
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,360
The Khumbu Glacier is a slow-moving 
river of ice, and the Khumbu Icefall  

309
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:04,480
is a large wall of broken ice. This icefall is 
over 300 metres high - six times higher than  

310
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:15,280
Niagara Falls - and the ice in it moves, very 
slowly, all the time. There are pieces of ice  

311
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,880
as big as houses, which could fall 
on the climbers' heads at any moment.  

312
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,920
There are avalanches of ice that could 
kill a man in a second. Terrible crevasses  

313
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,760
go hundreds of metres down into the 
blue-green darkness under the climbers' feet.  

314
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,960
Sometimes the climbers heard 
ice moving far below them.

315
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:54,640
The climbers and Sherpas carried loads of over 
18 kilograms up this difficult route. They made  

316
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:08,080
Camp 2 halfway up the icefall at 5,915 metres, and 
Camp 3 at the top of the icefall, at 6,158 metres.  

317
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:22,320
Then they climbed up the glacier to Camp 4 
at 6,462 metres, and Camp 5 at 6,705 metres.

318
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,400
The next big problem was to climb the Lhotse 
Face to the South Col. High above Camp  

319
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:44,080
5 is the mountain of Lhotse, 8,500 metres. To 
the left of Lhotse is the South Col of Everest.  

320
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:50,960
The first 600 metres of the Lhotse Face is 
a steep slope of ice - the Lhotse Glacier.  

321
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,560
This ice is very difficult to climb, 
with many ice walls and deep crevasses.

322
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:09,600
For eleven long days the New Zealander George Lowe 
and the Sherpa Annullu fought their way up this  

323
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,480
wall of ice. All the way, they cut steps in the 
ice and fixed ropes for the others to follow them.  

324
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:30,080
They made Camp 6 at 7,010 metres, 
and Camp 7 at 7,315 metres.  

325
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:41,360
Then they began to climb to the left, across a 
wide snow slope, towards the South Col. But the  

326
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:49,280
weather was terrible, and they were very tired. 
High winds blew down on them from the South Col.

327
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:02,960
After twelve days of this, George Lowe was 
exhausted. But on 21 May, Annullu and Wilfrid  

328
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:13,520
Noyce finally managed to cross the difficult snow 
slope and reach the South Col, at 7,925 metres.

329
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,280
Next day, Hillary, Tenzing, and seventeen 
Sherpas followed them up to the South Col.  

330
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,520
The Sherpas had only a cup of tea for 
breakfast at Camp 7, after a long cold night.

331
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:41,360
They were carrying loads of 22 kilograms 
with no oxygen. At the South Col,  

332
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:51,120
they made Camp 8. Then, the same day, they 
went down again to Camp 4. They had climbed  

333
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,640
for ten hours with no food or drink all day.

334
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:17,840
But Camp 8, on the South Col, was ready at last. 
Now the attempt on the summit could begin.
 
 

335
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,600
CHAPTER NINE

336
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,840
The South Summit - 1953

337
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,240
On 22 May, the first two summit climbers, 
Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans,  

338
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,800
set out from Camp 4 to the South Col. 
John Hunt and two Sherpas went with them,  

339
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:53,760
carrying heavy loads. Using oxygen, the three 
British men reached the Col first. But they  

340
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:01,040
were very tired, and when they took off their 
oxygen equipment they could not think clearly.  

341
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,360
It took them over an hour to put 
up a tent in the terrible wind.  

342
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,840
When the Sherpas arrived, they collapsed 
in the tent and could not move.

343
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,440
They rested for a day, then John Hunt and the 
Sherpa Da Namgyal set out to climb higher.  

344
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,480
They both had oxygen and were 
carrying about 20 kilograms.  

345
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:39,680
They moved very slowly, and Bourdillon and Evans 
soon came past them. Hunt and Da Namgyal both had  

346
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:47,440
problems with their oxygen. Sometimes ice stopped 
it working, and it was very difficult to breathe.

347
00:46:49,360 --> 00:47:00,720
On they went, more and more slowly. At 8,338 
metres Hunt and Da Namgyal could go no further.  

348
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,040
They put down their loads and turned back.  

349
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,240
When they reached the South 
Col, they could hardly walk.

350
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,640
Above them, Bourdillon and Evans went on.  

351
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,600
At 1 o'clock they reached the 
South Summit, 8,750 metres.

352
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:30,560
In front of them they could see the final summit 
ridge. It was a view no man had ever seen before.  

353
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:39,280
To the left, a steep rocky slope fell 
2,400 metres down to Camp 4 on the glacier.  

354
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:48,080
To the right, there was a line of white 
snow cornices over a drop of 2,500 metres.

355
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:57,440
Should they go on? This was their one 
chance to get to the top. But was it safe,  

356
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:06,720
or would they die, like Mallory and Irvine 
before them? They stood, and looked, and thought.

357
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,840
Evans had already had trouble with his 
oxygen. Bourdillon had fixed it, but they  

358
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:22,960
did not have a lot of oxygen left. They thought 
it would take three hours to reach the summit,  

359
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,000
and two hours to get back to the South 
Summit. By then it would be 6 o'clock,  

360
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:39,600
and they would have to climb down another 900 
metres, without oxygen, to Camp 8. It was too far.

361
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,680
So, sadly, they turned back. But it was the 
right thing to do. The wind grew stronger,  

362
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,240
and clouds came up. It was difficult 
to find the way. They were very tired,  

363
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,600
and several times they slipped on the way 
down. At one point Evans slipped and fell.  

364
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,440
He slid past Bourdillon like a bullet, and 
pulled him off his feet. A moment later  

365
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:19,200
they were both sliding down the snow towards 
the glacier, thousands of feet below. Quickly,  

366
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,680
Bourdillon turned onto his face 
and dug his ice axe into the snow.  

367
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,840
The ice axe stopped them, 
but they had nearly died.

368
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,880
Was this what happened to Mallory and 
Irvine, twenty-nine years earlier?  

369
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:46,800
they wondered. A sudden fall, on the way down, 
and no one to help? It could happen so easily.

370
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,760
When they reached Camp 8 they were 
exhausted. Their faces were covered with ice,  

371
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:03,680
and they could hardly walk. 'They looked like 
strangers from another planet,' John Hunt said.

372
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,840
But they had climbed higher 
than any man before them.
 
 

373
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,480
CHAPTER TEN

374
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,560
On top of the world - 1953

375
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,600
Hillary and Tenzing were already at Camp 
8, together with John Hunt, Da Namgyal,  

376
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:41,760
and Ang Temba. Gregory and Lowe were 
there too, with three more Sherpas.  

377
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,680
But the weather was bad. A terrible wind blew 
straight across the South Col, and the temperature  

378
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:59,280
fell to -25 degrees. Hillary said that it was one 
of the worst nights he had ever lived through.

379
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,640
No one could sleep. They sat shivering 
in their tents, hoping that the wind  

380
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:14,080
would not blow them away. Bourdillon and Evans 
were exhausted, three of the Sherpas were ill,  

381
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:24,400
and Hunt, like Ang Temba and Da Namgyal, 
had now spent three nights at 7,925 metres.

382
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,440
Next day, it was difficult for Bourdillon to walk,  

383
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:37,040
so Evans, John Hunt, and Da Namgyal 
helped him and Ang Temba down to Camp 7.  

384
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:45,280
Gregory, Lowe, and three Sherpas spent another 
night at Camp 8 with Hillary and Tenzing.

385
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,880
On the morning of 28 May the wind began to 
fall. Hillary and Tenzing got ready to set out.  

386
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,840
Gregory and Lowe's job was to start first and 
make Camp 9 somewhere below the South Summit.  

387
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:12,320
But two of their three Sherpas were 
ill, so Lowe, Gregory, and Ang Nyima  

388
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:20,000
carried everything between them. With 
their oxygen, they carried about 18  

389
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,960
kilograms each. Hillary and Tenzing followed 
at 10 a.m., carrying about 22 kilograms each.  

390
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:39,120
Then, at 8,338 metres, they found the 
loads which Hunt and Da Namgyal had left,  

391
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,480
and picked them up too. Now they 
were carrying 27 kilograms each.

392
00:52:49,360 --> 00:53:01,520
At 2.30 p.m. they found a small place for Camp 
9, at 8,506 metres. Gregory, Lowe, and Ang Nyima  

393
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:09,520
dropped their loads and went down. Hillary and 
Tenzing put up their tent, and crawled inside.  

394
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:18,800
The wind was very strong, and they were 
afraid the tent would blow away. That night,  

395
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:29,120
the temperature fell to -27 degrees. But by 4 
a.m. the wind had stopped, and the sky cleared.  

396
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,000
When they opened the tent door, in the 
early morning sun, they could see the  

397
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:45,040
monastery at Thyangboche, 4,878 metres below, 
where the monks were getting out of bed.

398
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,080
They melted snow for a warm drink, 
and checked the oxygen equipment  

399
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:58,960
carefully. Tenzing had worn his boots 
all night, but Hillary had taken his off,  

400
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:06,240
and they were as hard as ice. He had to heat 
them over the small cooker to make them soft.

401
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:15,920
At 6.30 a.m. they set out, and by 9 
a.m. they reached the South Summit.  

402
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:25,040
They sat down and studied the summit ridge 
carefully. It looked 'frightening', Hillary  

403
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:33,200
thought. The snow cornices to the right were very 
dangerous. They were like fingers of soft snow,  

404
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:42,320
2,500 metres above the valley below. And the 
rocks on the left looked very difficult too.  

405
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:51,840
But the snow just above the rocks looked 
better. Perhaps it was possible to climb there.

406
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:00,800
As soon as they stepped onto the snow, they were 
happy. It was good hard snow, so cutting steps  

407
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:10,000
in it was easy. But it was still very dangerous. 
One slip, and they could fall thousands of metres.  

408
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,640
Hillary went first, cutting steps in the snow.  

409
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:23,040
Behind him, Tenzing put the rope around his ice 
axe and dug it into the snow, to keep them safe.  

410
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:33,840
Then Hillary stopped, and Tenzing went first, 
cutting steps. First one man, then the other.

411
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,520
Several times their oxygen stopped 
working, and they found it hard to breathe.  

412
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:48,240
But each time they fixed it, and went 
on. As the sun rose, they felt warmer.  

413
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:57,520
'To my surprise, I was enjoying the climb,' 
Hillary said later. The weather was still  

414
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:04,960
fine, and they could see the tents 
of Camp 4, 2,439 metres below.

415
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:16,800
But halfway up the ridge, they met a problem. They 
reached a rock wall, 17 metres high. It looked  

416
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:25,680
difficult and dangerous to climb. On the left it 
was clean rock; on the right, the wind had blown  

417
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,840
a cornice of hard snow against it. Hillary 
pushed his boot into a hole between the rock  

418
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,760
and the snow. He began to climb with his back 
to the rock, hoping that the snow did not move.  

419
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,760
At last he reached the top of the 
wall, and Tenzing followed him up.

420
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:57,840
Now, there were just 220 vertical metres 
to go. Slowly, cutting steps in the snow,  

421
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:06,960
they climbed on. Even with oxygen, they had 
to take two or three breaths after every step.  

422
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,520
Each time they thought they had reached 
the summit, they saw another one higher.  

423
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,080
They were both tired. 'The ridge seemed 
never-ending,' Hillary wrote later.

424
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:34,400
But then, quite suddenly, it did end. They looked 
around, and realised they could not go any higher.  

425
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:42,160
It was 11.30 a.m, and they had 
reached the summit of Everest.

426
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:51,280
They shook hands and threw their arms round 
each other. Hillary took out a camera and  

427
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:58,800
took a picture - THE picture - of Tenzing on 
top of Everest, the highest man in the world.  

428
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:08,800
On his ice axe Tenzing had the flags of Great 
Britain, Nepal, India, and the United Nations.  

429
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,360
Hillary took pictures of the view 
north, south, east, and west.

430
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:24,320
Tenzing made a small hole in the snow. 
In it he put some sweets, a pencil  

431
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,320
which his daughter had given him, 
and the flags from the ice axe.  

432
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Hillary made a hole too, and 
put a small crucifix in there.  

433
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,840
They gave these things to the mountain 
Chomolungma - 'Goddess Mother of the World.'

434
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:52,160
They were on top of the world - but were they 
really the first men who had ever been there?

435
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:02,640
For a few minutes, Hillary and Tenzing searched, 
to see if Mallory and Irvine had left anything up  

436
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:11,520
there twenty-nine years ago. They found nothing, 
but that was not surprising. Every few days,  

437
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:19,040
there is new snow on the mountain. Every 
month, winds of over 150 kilometres per hour  

438
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:26,000
blow across the top of Everest, adding 
more snow, burying what was there before.

439
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,320
After fifteen minutes they turned back. 
They needed to get down before they used  

440
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:43,680
all the oxygen. They went carefully; it would 
be stupid to have an accident now. An hour later  

441
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,160
they were at the South Summit; by evening 
they were with George Lowe at the South Col.  

442
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,240
Next day they were down at Camp 4.

443
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:04,000
Only two men had reached the summit - 
one from New Zealand, one from Nepal.  

444
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,320
But everyone in the expedition was happy. They 
had done something no one had ever done before.  

445
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:27,840
But each man in the expedition had 
needed the help of all the others.
 
 

446
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,120
CHAPTER ELEVEN

447
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,840
One man alone - 1980

448
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:49,040
Since 1953, many hundreds of men and 
women have climbed Everest, most of them  

449
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:59,680
in large expeditions. Some groups have been very 
large indeed - in 1975 a Chinese expedition with  

450
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:09,120
400 people managed to send nine climbers to the 
summit. They left a small metal tripod there,  

451
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:18,000
fixed to the rock. In 1985 a Norwegian 
expedition sent seventeen people to the top.

452
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,760
All these climbers, like Hillary and 
Tenzing, needed the help of many others.  

453
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:35,120
Almost all of them used oxygen, too. People have 
climbed Everest from the south, north, and west.

454
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,720
But the first climber to 
climb the mountain all alone,  

455
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,280
with no oxygen at all, was Reinhold Messner.

456
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:57,760
In 1978 two climbers, Reinhold Messner and Peter 
Habeler, joined a large German-Austrian expedition  

457
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:07,200
climbing from Nepal. Most of the expedition 
were using oxygen but Messner and Habeler  

458
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:17,120
decided to climb without it. After 'the success 
of Hillary and Tenzing in 1953 using oxygen,'  

459
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:23,440
Messner said, 'the whole world thought 
that this must be the only way.'

460
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:36,640
But the early climbers did not think so. In 1924, 
Norton climbed to 8,575 metres with no oxygen.  

461
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:47,840
So, Messner thought, perhaps it is 
possible to climb 273 metres more.

462
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:56,640
He tried twice. The first time he reached 
the South Col with two Sherpas, but  

463
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,640
they were caught in a terrible storm. 
Their tent nearly collapsed in the wind,  

464
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,040
and they spent two nights without eating 
or drinking before they came down.  

465
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,200
But a few days later Messner tried 
again, with Peter Habeler, and  

466
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,400
in ten hours they climbed from the South 
Col to the summit, with no oxygen at all.  

467
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,400
But back at the South Col, they were very 
ill. Habeler had a terrible headache.  

468
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:40,400
Messner had taken off his goggles to make a 
film, and the bright snow had hurt his eyes.  

469
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:48,960
Just like Norton in 1924, he lay 
in his tent all night, unable  

470
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:57,840
to see anything. The two men needed help 
to climb down from the South Col next day.

471
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:07,440
Two years later, in 1980, Messner began a 
new attempt. This time he went through Tibet,  

472
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:15,920
like Norton and Mallory in 1924. But Messner 
did not take a lot of heavy equipment  

473
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:23,600
and hundreds of porters. He just went with his 
girlfriend, Nena, and two Chinese people came  

474
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:30,640
with them to show them the way. They started at 
the same place as the British Base Camp in 1924,  

475
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:41,360
then, with three yaks, they climbed to Camp 3 
at 6,500 metres on the East Rongbuk Glacier.  

476
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,680
Then the two Chinese went back to Base Camp,  

477
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:53,840
while Nena and Messner stayed at Camp 3 
for ten days, getting used to the height.

478
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,240
On 24 July Messner climbed to 
the North Col, at 7,000 metres.  

479
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:12,640
But he felt very tired, and there was too much 
soft snow. So he and Nena returned to Base Camp  

480
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:18,320
and spent three weeks walking 
and climbing above 5,000 metres.  

481
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:25,760
Each day they grew stronger, and breathed 
more easily in the thin mountain air.

482
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:37,760
On 15 August they returned to Camp 3, and on 17 
August Messner climbed up to the North Col again,  

483
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:47,200
much faster than before. Now he was ready, 
he thought. He came down to Camp 3 to sleep.  

484
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:56,720
That night he ate and drank, and slept for 
a while. Then he got up, dressed carefully,  

485
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,840
and packed his rucksack with everything he 
needed - food for a week, a small cooker,  

486
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,560
tent, sleeping bag, camera. He had 
a head torch, to see in the dark,  

487
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:17,840
two ski sticks, crampons, 
and a strong, light ice axe.

488
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:25,600
He touched Nena's face gently with his lips, 
and stepped out of the tent into the night.

489
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,400
'I shall be thinking of you,' 
she said sleepily. 'Bye bye.'

490
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,320
'Bye bye.' The words came out of 
the night, and then he was gone.

491
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:50,400
An hour later, he nearly died. When 
he was 500 metres above the camp,  

492
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:56,800
the snow suddenly collapsed under 
his feet and he fell into a crevasse.  

493
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:05,760
His head torch went out, and everything was dark. 
He had decided not to take a radio with him.  

494
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:13,840
Now he was frightened. He could see nothing, 
and it was not possible to call for help.

495
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:25,360
Then the torch came on again. He was standing on 
a snow bridge, about 1 metre square, above a deep  

496
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:34,800
black hole. He looked round. There was a small ice 
ridge to the left, going up. But to climb that,  

497
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:43,200
he needed crampons on his boots; and his 
crampons were in his rucksack. Very carefully,  

498
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:52,480
he got them out and put them on. Carefully, he 
reached forward across the crevasse with his arms.  

499
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:00,960
Then he stepped across onto the 
ridge - right foot first, then left.  

500
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:11,040
The crampons held in the ice. Slowly, he 
climbed up, out of the crevasse, into the night.

501
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:17,040
Far below, Nena was still sleeping in the tent.

502
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:27,280
He climbed on, up to the North Col. As the sun 
came out, the clouds and mountains turned from  

503
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:36,320
dark blue to yellow and then pink. There was good 
hard snow under his feet. He climbed quickly,  

504
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:45,680
taking fifty steps, then resting, then taking 
fifty more. The ski sticks made climbing easier.

505
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,840
As he climbed, Messner thought 
about Mallory and Irvine.  

506
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,920
They had come the same way up the mountain,  

507
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:04,160
long ago. They had oxygen, but their clothes 
and equipment were much heavier than Messner's.  

508
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:15,840
Mallory and Irvine had no light tents and 
sleeping bags, no crampons, no ski sticks. But  

509
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:25,200
when Odell last saw them, they were high up on 
the North Ridge. Two tiny black dots on the snow,  

510
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:33,840
going strongly. Did they reach the summit, 
he wondered. Or did they die before that?

511
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:45,600
Far below him, Nena stood outside the tent, 
watching Messner climb higher and higher. To her,  

512
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:53,600
he was now a tiny black dot on the snow. 'I would 
like to climb with him,' she wrote in her diary.  

513
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:04,480
'One day perhaps, I tell myself... The further 
he is from me, the stronger becomes my love.'

514
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:16,800
By 9 a.m. Messner was at 7,360 metres. He was 
tired, and had to rest every thirty steps.  

515
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:25,360
Up here, the thin dry air had only one 
third as much oxygen as at sea level.  

516
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:32,240
His throat hurt, and for long moments 
he could think of nothing but breathing.

517
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:41,600
'Still a bit more, you can do it,' he 
told himself. 'What you climb today,  

518
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,840
you won't have to climb tomorrow.'

519
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:53,840
At last, at 7,800 metres, high up on 
the North Ridge, he decided to stop.  

520
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:03,520
The view from here was wonderful. Some of the 
highest mountains in the Himalayas were below him.  

521
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,840
And 1,300 metres below, he could 
see the tiny red dot of Nena's tent.

522
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:22,560
He took a long, long time to put up his tent. 
Again and again, the wind almost blew it away.  

523
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,280
He held it down with his ski sticks and ice axe.  

524
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:36,160
Then he pushed his rucksack inside and 
crawled in after it. But he could not rest.  

525
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,160
To get water, he had to melt 
snow with his small stove.  

526
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:51,600
His throat hurt, but he had to make himself 
drink. He was not hungry, but he had to cook  

527
01:11:51,600 --> 01:12:00,240
and make himself eat. And that night, a storm 
came up. The temperature fell to -20 degrees.  

528
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,840
Winds of over 80 kilometres per hour 
tried to blow the tent off the mountain.

529
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,520
Next morning the wind had fallen, 
but Messner felt terribly tired.  

530
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:25,600
For an hour he lay in his tent, half asleep, 
unable to move. Every small thing - making a  

531
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:33,040
drink, eating, putting on his boots - was 
hard work. He had to argue with himself.

532
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,040
'You must go on,' he told himself. 
Then, a minute later: 'Why don't I go  

533
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:51,760
down?' But he knew the answer to that. 'I 
wanted to make the climb. I still want to.'

534
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:59,200
He took the tent down and packed 
his rucksack. The sky was blue,  

535
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:09,920
the sun was shining. But as he set out, the clouds 
and wind came back. His legs were tired, and his  

536
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:18,480
18 kilogram rucksack seemed heavier than before. 
Every fifteen steps now, he stopped to rest.

537
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:28,800
There was too much new snow on the ridge, so he 
moved down onto the rocky north face - the same  

538
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:36,640
way that Norton had gone, also without oxygen. The 
rocks sloped steeply like the roof on a church.  

539
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:47,600
It was very quiet, but Messner began to hear 
voices. 'Is that somebody talking nearby?'  

540
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:59,840
he wondered. 'Is somebody there?... I believe I 
hear voices. Perhaps it is Mallory and Irvine!'

541
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:10,160
By 3 o'clock in the afternoon he was at 8,220 
metres. He was too tired to go on any more.  

542
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:19,600
He could only take ten steps now before resting. 
He found a flat piece of snow above a large rock,  

543
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:28,080
and put up his tent there. He took a picture 
of the tent, then got inside his sleeping bag.  

544
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:34,640
Again, he had to melt snow to get 
water. And it was difficult to sleep.  

545
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,840
Even when he was resting in the tent, 
his heart was beating 100 times a minute.

546
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:53,040
Next morning he could see little - he was in the 
clouds. Should he go on, or wait, he wondered.  

547
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,880
No, he thought, he couldn't wait.  

548
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:09,840
'It's now or never. Either-or. I must either 
go up or go down. There is no other choice.'

549
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:20,320
He decided to leave the tent and rucksack behind. 
He put the camera in his pocket, picked up his ice  

550
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:28,400
axe, and set out. It was harder to climb without 
the ski sticks. He was afraid that he would fall,  

551
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:38,960
so he often climbed on hands and knees. As he 
climbed up to the ridge, it became steeper. Often,  

552
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,720
he dug his ice axe into the snow above 
his head, and lay on his face, resting.

553
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,840
For three hours he crawled slowly along 
the ridge. His dry throat felt like wood.  

554
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:01,600
'Where is the summit?' he wondered. 
He could see almost nothing.  

555
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:09,520
Then, suddenly, the cloud cleared, and he could 
see right down to the glacier in the valley.  

556
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,600
He took a few photos, then the cloud came back.

557
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:22,720
'Where is the summit?' he wondered. 'At most it 
can only be another ten metres up to the top!'  

558
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:31,600
He crawled on, always upwards. 
Then, suddenly, there it was.  

559
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:40,080
The metal tripod, which the Chinese had fixed 
to the summit in 1975 - it was there in front  

560
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:48,880
of him! Messner had seen it before, in 1978; 
now he took hold of it, like an old friend.

561
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:59,280
He had done it! He was on top of the world, 
with nothing above him but sky. He sat down,  

562
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:08,880
like a stone. All he wanted to do was rest. 
But it was after 3 o'clock. He could not stay  

563
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:18,640
here in the dark. Slowly, he got up. He took a 
few photos. Then, at 4 o'clock, he turned to go.

564
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:27,040
'I must get back down,' he thought. 'Half 
an hour too late means the end of me.'

565
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,000
On the way down he started coughing badly.  

566
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,120
When he reached the tent he lay in his sleeping 
bag like a dead man. But he could not sleep.  

567
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,880
He melted a little snow to drink, but ate nothing. 
Next morning, he left the tent where it was.  

568
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:57,920
Carrying the ski sticks and rucksack, he came 
down the mountain like a man walking in his sleep.  

569
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:05,680
Twice he slipped and fell. Each time, he turned 
on his face and dug his ice axe into the snow.

570
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:13,600
Then suddenly, on the glacier, he 
saw Nena standing in front of him.  

571
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:22,800
Resting on his ski sticks, he looked at 
her. Was she really there? Yes, she was.

572
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,520
'Reinhold, how are you?' she 
said. She ran towards him.

573
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:37,200
Messner fell to his knees. He was 
crying. Nena held him in her arms.  

574
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:45,520
'Everything's OK, Reinhold,' she said. 'You 
are all right. The camp is over there.'

575
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,760
'Where are all my friends?' he asked.

576
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:57,600
'I'm your friend. I'm here, Reinhold. 
Don't worry, we're going to our camp now.'

577
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,400
'Yes, where is the camp actually?' he asked.

578
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:13,920
'Over there.' She took his rucksack, and led him 
to the camp. Here, she gave him food and drink and  

579
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:21,840
let him sleep. All next day he lay in his sleeping 
bag without moving, while Nena watched over him.

580
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:32,080
Reinhold Messner had climbed the highest 
mountain in the world, all alone, with no  

581
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:42,480
oxygen. But the mountain had beaten him too. They 
both won this fight, the mountain and the man.
 
 

582
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,320
CHAPTER TWELVE

583
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,600
The final question

584
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:05,760
By 1999, many people, both men and women, had 
climbed Everest. They came from the USA, India,  

585
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:15,280
China, Japan, Italy, and many more countries. 
One climber, Goran Kropp from Sweden,  

586
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:25,120
rode his bicycle to Everest, climbed the mountain 
without oxygen, and rode home again. But still  

587
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,320
nobody had found an answer to the question: 
what happened to Mallory and Irvine?

588
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,840
A climber called Jochen Hemmleb 
became interested in this problem  

589
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:48,160
in 1988. He studied the problem for years, and his 
bedroom was full of books and photos of Everest.  

590
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:53,680
But with every new piece of 
information, there were new questions.

591
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:09,520
In 1924, Odell was at 7,926 metres, climbing up 
behind Mallory and Irvine towards Camp 6. At 12.50  

592
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:16,320
p.m. the clouds cleared, and Odell could 
see the summit ridge of Everest above him.  

593
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:28,320
High up on the ridge, he saw two tiny black dots 
moving on the snow. They were moving quickly. He  

594
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:35,440
saw them climb a rock step on the ridge. Then 
the clouds came back and they disappeared.

595
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:43,840
There are three rock steps on the north-east 
ridge: the First Step, the Second Step,  

596
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:52,000
and the Third Step. The Second Step is much 
harder to climb than the First and Third Steps.  

597
01:21:53,360 --> 01:22:01,680
It is a steep rock wall, like the front of 
a ship. But it is only about 250 vertical  

598
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:09,840
metres from the summit; and the Third Step 
is even closer. So the first question is:  

599
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:18,240
which of the three steps were Mallory and 
Irvine climbing when Odell last saw them?

600
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:27,760
In 1924, Odell said it was the 'rock step 
at a very short distance from the base  

601
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,520
of the final pyramid.' And both of 
them climbed quickly to the top of it.  

602
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,160
It is difficult to climb the Second Step, 
but much easier to climb the Third Step.  

603
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,200
And the First Step is quite a 
long distance from the summit.

604
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:54,720
So at 12.50 p.m., Mallory and Irvine 
were probably at either the Second Step  

605
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:01,920
or the Third Step - only 'a very 
short distance' from the summit.  

606
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:12,720
If that is right, did they stop there? Probably 
not. All the difficult parts of the climb  

607
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:20,160
were behind them. They had oxygen, and 
Odell said they were 'moving quickly.'

608
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:30,560
So did they reach the summit, before they 
died? Many people think it is quite possible.  

609
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:39,920
But others think Odell made a mistake. 
'He only saw them for a moment,' they say.  

610
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:48,240
'He probably saw them climb the First 
Step - much further from the summit.'

611
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,600
Reinhold Messner agrees. 'Mallory 
did not climb the Second Step,'  

612
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,760
he says. 'Odell saw them on the First Step.'

613
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,960
So who is right? And how can we know?

614
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:16,320
In 1933, a British climber found Irvine's ice 
axe at 8,460 metres, just below the First Step.  

615
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,880
But why was it there? Did he 
put it down, or drop it in an  

616
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:33,200
accident? And did this happen on the 
way up, or the way down? No one knows.

617
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:45,280
In 1960, a Chinese climber found an old wooden 
tent post and rope, like those used in 1924,  

618
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:54,160
just below the Second Step. 
And in 1979 a Japanese climber  

619
01:24:54,160 --> 01:25:01,840
met another Chinese climber, Wang Hongbao, 
on the mountain, and heard a strange story.

620
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:12,960
Four years earlier, Wang said, he had found a body 
- 'an English dead' - near the Chinese Camp 6,  

621
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:22,640
at 8,100 metres. Was this Mallory, perhaps, 
or Irvine? The Japanese climber wanted to  

622
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:30,160
ask more questions, but the very next day, 
Wang himself was killed in an avalanche.

623
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,960
So the questions continued. In 1999,  

624
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,880
Jochen Hemmleb was part of an expedition 
that set out to find some answers.

625
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,120
From Tibet, they climbed slowly up 
the East Rongbuk Glacier to Camp 5,  

626
01:25:52,080 --> 01:26:02,160
just under the North East Ridge. At 7,900 metres, 
one climber, Andy Politz, reached the place  

627
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:10,560
where Odell had last seen Mallory and Irvine far 
above him. Where had they actually been, when he  

628
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:18,400
saw them? Politz looked up. He could clearly 
see each of the First, Second and Third Steps.

629
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:29,520
'You are really close to them at that point,' he 
said. 'And there was only one place that (was) "a  

630
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:37,360
very short distance from the base of the final 
pyramid", and that was the Third Step - the one  

631
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:43,600
nearest the summit.' He took a lot of 
photographs and video film to make this clear.

632
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:52,800
The five climbers reached Camp 6, near the place 
where Wang Hongbao had seen the 'English dead.'  

633
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,960
On 1 May 1999, they set 
out to find the body again.  

634
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,760
They climbed across a steep snow 
slope, some going up, others down.

635
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:13,600
It was a dangerous, frightening place. 
A strong wind made it easy to fall.  

636
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:23,120
After half an hour, they had found the 
bodies of not one but six dead climbers.  

637
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,000
All the dead bodies had broken arms or legs.  

638
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:36,080
And the climbers knew that at any moment they 
could fall and die too, like the men before them.

639
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,200
But the dead bodies wore modern clothes,  

640
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:48,880
in bright red or orange colours - very different 
from the clothes that climbers wore in 1924.  

641
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:58,800
Then Conrad Anker saw something white on the 
rocks below him. He climbed down carefully  

642
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:07,120
towards it. Then he called the others on his 
radio. 'Come down here,' he said. 'Look at this.'

643
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:16,800
As soon as they saw it, they knew this body 
was different. This was no modern climber.  

644
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,040
This man had been here for seventy-five years.  

645
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:27,840
Some of his clothes were gone, blown 
away by the wind, and his skin was white.

646
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:37,680
There was no oxygen equipment. The rope around his 
waist had cut into the skin, and was broken at one  

647
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:45,600
end where he had fallen. One leg was broken 
in two places. His head and arms were cut.

648
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:54,800
They stood and looked at the body quietly 
for a while. They took photographs. Then,  

649
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,840
very gently, they began to look in 
the pockets of the man's clothes.

650
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:10,000
One thing they hoped to find was a camera. 
In 1924, when Mallory and Irvine set out for  

651
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,040
the summit, Somervell gave Mallory 
a small camera to take with him.  

652
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:23,840
Did Mallory take photos at the summit, 
or not? The camera could give the answer.

653
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:31,760
In Mallory's pockets they found some sweets, some 
letters from his brother and sister, a knife,  

654
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:40,080
a broken watch, his snow goggles - but no 
camera. They looked carefully all around,  

655
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,320
but the camera was not there.

656
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:52,240
It was too cold and dangerous to stay there long. 
But they did not want to leave the body as it was.  

657
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:58,640
For all of them, Mallory was a great man 
- one of the first and bravest of all the  

658
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:05,840
men who tried to climb Everest. So, before 
they left, they decided to bury his body.  

659
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:12,160
They covered the body with big stones. 
Then they said prayers over the body.

660
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:20,320
They had found one body, but they were still 
looking for answers. It was clear, though,  

661
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:26,240
that Mallory had stopped using oxygen. 
There was no oxygen equipment on his body,  

662
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,280
so he probably threw it away 
when he had used all the oxygen.  

663
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:38,640
That means Mallory and Irvine did not 
turn back early - like Bourdillon and  

664
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:44,560
Evans in 1953 - when they still had 
enough oxygen to get back to Camp 6.  

665
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,240
Probably they went on, trying to reach the 
summit even when they knew it was dangerous.

666
01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:03,680
Mallory's snow goggles were in his pocket, so 
perhaps he was coming down after dark. The broken  

667
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:10,160
rope round Mallory's waist shows that the two 
men were probably still climbing down together.  

668
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:20,560
The moon went down early that night, at 11.25 
p.m.; after that there was only starlight to  

669
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:29,280
help them. They were tired, thirsty, and 
had no oxygen. But they were only 400  

670
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:37,840
metres from the tiny tent at Camp 6, where 
Odell had left food. They were almost safe.

671
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,960
And then - something happened. 
Perhaps something like this:
 
 

672
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:56,560
They are climbing down together in the dark. 
Irvine is going first, Mallory is behind.  

673
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:04,560
Suddenly, Mallory slips and falls. Irvine 
tries to save him but the rope breaks.  

674
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:13,600
Mallory falls faster and faster. When he 
hits the ground his leg breaks in two places.  

675
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,800
But he does not stop. He is 
sliding down the steep slope,  

676
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:27,200
towards the Rongbuk Glacier thousands of feet 
below. He has dropped his ice axe, but he turns  

677
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:35,520
on his face and digs his fingers into the snow 
above his head, trying to slow down. He stops,  

678
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:44,880
but he has hit his head on a rock. He lies 
there, unable to move, dying alone in the dark.

679
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:53,840
Somewhere far above him, Irvine is 
injured too. He calls to Mallory, again  

680
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:02,720
and again, but there is no answer. 
Slowly, he tries to crawl towards Camp 6,  

681
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:15,920
but he cannot find it. Alone, and lost in the dark 
and icy cold at 8,200 metres, Irvine dies too.

682
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,240
Did they reach the summit before they died?  

683
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:30,080
Only Mallory's camera can answer that 
question, and no one has found it.

684
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:42,080
But there is one other important thing which no 
one has found. When Mallory left England in 1924,  

685
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:51,040
he took a photo of his wife, Ruth, with him. And 
he made a promise to her, in words like these.

686
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:58,080
'I'll look at your photo every 
day. But I will not bring it back.  

687
